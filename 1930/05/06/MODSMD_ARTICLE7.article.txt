# OBJECTIONS TO LOCKOUT RULES VOICED BY SORORITY PRESIDENTS
## 
### 
Accidents, evasions, and the annoy
ance of oiT-campus over-nights are the
j worst aspects of the present lock-out
j system. Such was the verdict given
yesterday by the presidents of the vari
! oils women .s living groups.
(•ranting that the present system is
J tlic immediate and unavoidable cause
of these evils, the house executive cx
i pressed the conviction that a change in
the present system is the only solution
j to the acknowledged serious problem.
House Presidents Speak
I Following are expressions of opin
■ ion from the living group presidents:
Klizahcth West, ( hi Omega "The
, proposed change in the lock-out sys
| tern will materially decrease lock-outs.
I he annoyance of staying overnight in
I'alo Alto or San Francisco will also
be removed."
Jean Long. Delta Delta Delta "At
present, provisions for week-end leaves

i are inadequate. A change is ncccssary.
i A proportional allotment of late leaves
during the week should be arranged
' for."
Lock-Outs Disagreeable
Mary-Jane I'olloek, Alpha I 'hi
"Staying over-night in I'alo Alto in
order to dance in the city on a week
end is the most disagreeable feature
of the existing lock out rule. The 2;.?ll
o'clock leave on Friday and Saturday,
; and the 11 :.4(> o'clock with <|ualifica
' tions during the week are needed to
I remedy this situation. The 'change
j should nbt he made too hastily."
Antoinette Schulte, Alpha Omicron
I'i—"A change in the lock-out rules is
needed, for the present system has
i proved inadequate. The cumulative
I plan of granting a total of 30 minutes
of lock-out time is particularly de
sirable."
