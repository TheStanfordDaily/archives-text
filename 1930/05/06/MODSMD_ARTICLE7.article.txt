# OBJECTIONS TO LOCKOUT RULES VOICED BY SORORITY PRESIDENTS
## 
### 
Accidents, evasions, and the annoy
ance of oiT-campus over-nights are the
j worst aspects of the present lock-out
j system. Such was the verdict given
yesterday by the presidents of the vari
! oils women .s living groups.
(•ranting that the present system is
J tlic immediate and unavoidable cause
of these evils, the house executive cx
i pressed the conviction that a change in
the present system is the only solution
j to the acknowledged serious problem.
House Presidents Speak
I Following are expressions of opin
■ ion from the living group presidents:
Klizahcth West, ( hi Omega "The
, proposed change in the lock-out sys
| tern will materially decrease lock-outs.
I he annoyance of staying overnight in
I'alo Alto or San Francisco will also
be removed."
Jean Long. Delta Delta Delta "At
present, provisions for week-end leaves

i are inadequate. A change is ncccssary.
i A proportional allotment of late leaves
during the week should be arranged
' for."
Lock-Outs Disagreeable
Mary-Jane I'olloek, Alpha I 'hi
"Staying over-night in I'alo Alto in
order to dance in the city on a week
end is the most disagreeable feature
of the existing lock out rule. The 2;.?ll
o'clock leave on Friday and Saturday,
; and the 11 :.4(> o'clock with <|ualifica
' tions during the week are needed to
I remedy this situation. The 'change
j should nbt he made too hastily."
Antoinette Schulte, Alpha Omicron
I'i—"A change in the lock-out rules is
needed, for the present system has
i proved inadequate. The cumulative
I plan of granting a total of 30 minutes
of lock-out time is particularly de
sirable."
Anne Coleman, I'i Beta Phi—"Al
lowing 2 :.$() o'clock leaves during the i
week in a limited ratio similar to the j
present 11 :30 o'clock system, for spc- I
cial occasions, would help remove the j
unpleasant feature of staying over
night off campus."
Ann Prick, Kappa Alpha Theta—
"Week-end 2:30 o'clock leaves, 1 :30
o'clock during the week, and a limited
number of 2:JO o'clock leaves during
the week are much needed improve
ments to the present lock-out ques
tion."
Too Severe
Jane Rnmbley, Gamma Phi Beta —
"Punishments for lock-outs at pres
ent are far too severe. Some lock- j
outs are unavoidable, and considcra- I
tion for this should be made. It is this \
aspect of the situation which is re- '
sponsible for accidents, and evasions of
the lockout rules."
Helen Hawkins, Sigma Kappa—"A
change in the lock-out system as it
now stands i> definitely demanded. The
eulminative system oil the lock-out al
lowance', 2:30 o'clock leaves on Friday
and Saturday, and 1 :30 o'clock auto
matic mid-week leaves are the most
needed improvements."
