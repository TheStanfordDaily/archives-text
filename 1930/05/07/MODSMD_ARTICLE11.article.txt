# ENGLISH PEOPLE DISLIKE TALKIES SAYS BARRY JONES, STAGE STAR
## 
### BY MARY LEE RICHMOND 
"The Knglish do not like flu- j
'talkies.' " Harry Jones said this with •
just a little pride in his voice, for ■
the distinguished actor now play
ing at the Erlanger's Columbia in ;
San Francisco is very English him- :
self, and tremendously loyal to the i
stage, and Bernard Shaw's work in
particular.
"Shaw is England's favorite. His;
plays never fall to pack the play
houses there, and 'Man and Super
man,' 'The Doctor's Dllemnn,' and
'Arms and the Man' are played
over and over again." Hearing
Marry Jones talk about Shaw was
more than ordinarily interesting,
for the Colbourne-Jones company
has had a great deal of personal
contact with the famous dramatist,
who has attended many of their re
hearsals and criticized their works.
"But Shaw is not at all formid
able," insisted Harry Jones. "He
draws some one of us aside and
talks it over —oh, in tlie most
< harming manner imaginable. You
can have no idea what a charming

man Shaw is until you really meet |
him."
We were willing enough to admit
that Shaw, or any Englishman in
fact, could be charming, after meet- ,
'ing and talking to Horry Jones. He
is slight, very tan, with incredibly
blue eyes, a quick smile, and a
boyish eagerness in his voice and
manner that exhilarates you just
in listening to him. He is an aris
tocrat, a fine actor, with a sense
of humor as exquisite off the stage
as on, and a gift for making you 1
like him that amounts to genius.
The English actor confessed that !
although he had spent one after- ;
noon at Woodside, he had not yet
seen Stanford. And since he had
not begun to take the interview
seriously, he laughingly explained
that be felt quite close to the .
University in spite of this.
"You see," he said, "I was invited
to play tennis, but found that I
had no belt for my tennis pants.
And so someone found me a Stan
lord belt, Which gave me a beauti
ful claim on your college."
