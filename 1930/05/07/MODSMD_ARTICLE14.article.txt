### 
Swelling the student quota, gen
erous contributions flowed into tho
Convalescent Home treasury yes
terday in the second day of the
annual A.S.S.U. appeal for funds.
"Stanford's i espouse is indeed
gratifying," said Irwin Warner late
last night after the second day of
active work had passed. "We hope
to get some kind of a contribution
from every student in the Univer
sity," continued Sylva Weaver,
head of the women's drive. "The
response to the women speakers
has been splendid, and many of
the living groups are coming
through 100 per cent."
K.K.G. Leading
That Stanford students are doing
their bit to keep the "Homo fires
burning" was more than evident
when the list of contributions came
into the Daily office last, night.
Kappa Kappa Gamma was still
leading with their contribution of
$300, and the individual living
group quota is reported to bo con
sistently higher than it was last
year. As yet no response has come
in from the students in Palo Alto,
to whom letters have been sent.
Any students living off campus are
urged to send in their contribu
tions to "Convalescent Home Drive,
A.S.S.U. Office, Campus."

Drive Ends Tonight
Although the Drive ends officially
tonight after Labor Day, the full
treasurers' reports will probably
not come in until Thursday and Fri
day. It is hoped by the leaders that
some students who have not do
nated to Stanford's Own charity
will respond to the A.S.S.U. appeal
after visiting the Home this after
noon.
Last year the students raised
$4000 which was 10 per cent ol' the
year's total maintenance for the
campus charity. This sum includes
contributions from the ''lass of
proceeds from the 15+29
Masque Ball, donations from fac
ulty members, special theatre fund
proceeds, as well as Hie money se
cured directly from students.

when the list of contributions came
into the Daily office last, night.
Kappa Kappa Gamma was still
leading with their contribution of
$300, and the individual living
group quota is reported to bo con
sistently higher than it was last
year. As yet no response has come
in from the students in Palo Alto,
to whom letters have been sent.
Any students living off campus are
urged to send in their contribu
tions to "Convalescent Home Drive,
A.S.S.U. Office, Campus."

Drive Ends Tonight
Although the Drive ends officially
tonight after Labor Day, the full
treasurers' reports will probably
not come in until Thursday and Fri
day. It is hoped by the leaders that
some students who have not do
nated to Stanford's Own charity
will respond to the A.S.S.U. appeal
after visiting the Home this after
noon.
Last year the students raised
$4000 which was 10 per cent ol' the
year's total maintenance for the
campus charity. This sum includes
contributions from the ''lass of
proceeds from the 15+29
Masque Ball, donations from fac
ulty members, special theatre fund
proceeds, as well as Hie money se
cured directly from students.
Swelling the student quota, gen
erous contributions flowed into tho
Convalescent Home treasury yes
terday in the second day of the
annual A.S.S.U. appeal for funds.
"Stanford's i espouse is indeed
gratifying," said Irwin Warner late
last night after the second day of
active work had passed. "We hope
to get some kind of a contribution
from every student in the Univer
sity," continued Sylva Weaver,
head of the women's drive. "The
response to the women speakers
has been splendid, and many of
the living groups are coming
through 100 per cent."
