# STUDENTS SIGN LETTER PLEDGING ENFORCEMENT OF HONOR CODE; FEAR DOWNFALL OF SYSTEM
## TWENTY-ONE SIGNATURES AFFIXED TO PROPOSAL Characterizing Present Student Attitude Toward Code As Lethargic, Leaders Feel Called Upon To Protect Advances Already Won 
### 
Moved to action by the present decadent condition of the 1 lonor
Code as a working institution at Stanford, a number of students
prominent in campus affairs yesterday pledged their support to the
Code and its strict enforcement. The attitude of the students in
enforcing the JJonor Code was characterized as lethargic, and the

belief was expressed that the continu
ance of such an attitude would make
the Code an impossibility.
A signed letter, setting ferth the
ideas of the group of students on the
matter, follows:
We, the undersigned students of
Stanford University, consider the
present lethargic attitude of many stu
dents in reporting fellow students who
are guilty of violations of the Honor
Code as an attitude which makes the
proper working out of the Honor
Code an impossibility. Therefore to
protect our own scholastic interests
and to revive and perpetuate the spirit
upon which the Honor Code \\a>
founded we, as members of the stu
dent body, will not tolerate any vi<>
lations of the Honor Code which
come to our attention, 1 »i«t, will im
mediately report such violations to
the proper student authorities. We
sincerely believe that the Honor Code
as a living Stanford institution can
be continued only in this manner and
we request and urge the remaining
members of the Student Body to join
with us in expressing a willingness
and a desire to report all known vio
lations of the Honor Code, and to
guide their conduct in accordance
therewith.
