# ENOUGH MARKING TIME

### 
Monday night every one ot Stanford's eleven women's living
groups expressed approval of the proposed changes in the A.W'.S.
lock-out system.-
AJondav afternoon, in a series of Daii.y interviews, the presi
dents <i< nine campus sororits houses expressed the conviction that
.1 change in the present system is the onlv solution of a serious
problem.
Last week, in an .\.\\ .S. mass meeting, it was unanimously indi
cated that Stanford's women students are convinced that n reform
is desirable.
I I nis it has been clearly and forcibly shown that the sentiment
ot the women is overwhelmingly* in favor of the proposed changes.
This sentiment has been sane and authentic. It has been formulated
slowly and expressed through the proper channels. Xo effort has
been made to stampede the women into a hysterical and half-con
sidered action.
This thing has been considered now for two Every cf
lort has been made, during those two weeks, to secure the genuine
and sensible expression of student sentiment. In short, the best in
struments ot popular government have been utilized and the best
traditions of democracy have been observed.
Now it is time for action.
'I hursday there is to be a meeting. Conference members are
well supplied with "representative opinion,'" and Thursday evening
should mark the end of these preliminaries. At the meeting the
question should be settled once and for all as far as the women them
selves are concerned. Definite resolutions should be passed, and pre
sented the administration in documentary form.
The women want these changes; and the women's officers should
do their part in seeing that they get them.
Apparently an effort has been made, all during the controversy,
to retard the progress of those who desire to alter the existing order.
Throughout the course of the discussions attempts were made to
suppress all news of the results. ()nly with difficulty has the Daily
been able to inform its readers of each step.
Before the living groups met Monday evening ihe president of
each was provided with a letter —an unsigned letter written on
AAV.S. stationery. This anonymous epistle is symbolic of ihe con
servative underground sentiment.
Writing to the Campus Opinion column of the Daily, "A Con
ference Member" protests this unsigned letter. Portions of her
communication deserve to be reprinted because they raise pertinent
questions..
"In the first place (asks the writer) 1 would enquire just who
sent out the letter, as it was written on AAV.S. stationery and not
signed. Then it presupposed an attitude on the part of Women's
Conference which has not even met for two weeks. Sending the
letter out in the guise of Conference without that body's sanction is
certainly not in keeping with the orthodox methods of student
government which Dr. Swain has been pleading for So
\\ HO, Mr. Kditor, is formulating the opinion of Conference and
Council for them? If it is the president of A.W'.S. speaking and
bead of the two women's government bodies—all well and good —
but at least such a fact might be recognized by a signature."
Ihe Daily's correspondent asks ''.Mr. Kditor" just who is for
mulating the opinion of Conference and Council for them. "Mr.
Kditor" has been wondering about that for a long time, himself.
At any rate there is to be a meeting Thursday. Is that meeting
going to be a process of marking time ; or is it going to mean definite
action ?
As officers elected by the women of this I diversity, the Presi
dent of AAV.S. and members of Women's Council have but one
course to follow—that of acting on the unmistakable desires of those
Avho put them in the positions they occupy.
If student government can be held to mean anything, this action
will be taken.
