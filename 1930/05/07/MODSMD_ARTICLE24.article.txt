# LABOR DAY
## 
### 
Today the inveterate Stanford rough comes into his own. It
is Labor Day.the day when Stanford students, men and women,
erase ihe creases of study from their hrows, close their books, and
turn to more material things in the manner of manual diversion at
the Convalescent I fome.
To make Labor Day a success, every student, even including
those petite members of the l ive Hundred, is expected to report
at the Convalescent Nome prepared for action. The work today is
to render the Home ship-shape until another Labor Dav rolls
around.
This effort on part of the students toward Stanford's Own Char
ity is divided into two parts: one for the women and the other for
the men. The women will wash windows in the five units com
prising the 1 Tome, sift the sandpiles, mend toys, and clean the front
yards. The men have not the variety of tasks open to the women.
They will wield hoes and other garden implements in the process
of weeding and otherwise caring for the gardens about the units,
besides cutting wood for the Home's supply of winter fuel.
To top off the day's strenuous labor, there is to be entertainment
in the form of skits, exhibitions of dancing, and music. To appease
the pangs of hunger aroused by their work, barbecue and sand
wiches will be furnished by the Convalescent Home committee.
