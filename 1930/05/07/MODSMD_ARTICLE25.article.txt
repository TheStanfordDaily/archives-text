THE DOVER ROAD—At the Col
umbia Theatre, San Francisco.
Being Hip second of I lit' English
company's (!. B. Sliaw-A. A. Milne
Oscar Wilde repertoire. Written toy
Milne, you could hank on its toeing
good entertainment before ever en
tering the theatre, but the lines.se
and comedy which these twelve
English troupers put into their pro
ductions is a revelation. They work
uh closely as a team of jailtoreakers,
and all are good actors. E.g., the
women's lead in "Arms and the
Man," which tliey put on last wet k,
is now east as a female hasher, and
other parts are switched around in
the same way. The stars refuse to
take a curia in call without the rest
of Ihe troupe.
Today's matinee and tonight are
the last performances of "The
Dover Road" (which started Mon
day). Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday
matinee and evening, "The Import
ance of lleing Earnest," that prime
.favorite of Wilde's, will he pre
sented. Advance information has it
that the play sparkles throughout
wit. hfine wit and repartee, and that
it .is one of Wilde's best, because
il is not out of date. Also, there, is
a good "tea light" in the lirsf act,
its the English actors call an after
noon tea.
Don't miss a chance to see Harry
Jones, who, with Maurice Col
toourne, is one of the leading lights.
Jones' face and Oolbourne's voice
would fascinate anyone, if you see
"The Dover Road" tonight, 'watch
Jones in the second act, and a free
ticket to the next Camera charity
tight if you can figure out how he
develops such a realistic, racking
cough. Hackstage, right after the
show, he had his natural voice

i hack again, but it was a wonder.

THE DOVER ROAD—At the Col

Being Hip second of I lit' English
company's (!. B. Sliaw-A. A. Milne
Oscar Wilde repertoire. Written toy
Milne, you could hank on its toeing
good entertainment before ever en
tering the theatre, but the lines.se
and comedy which these twelve
English troupers put into their pro
ductions is a revelation. They work
uh closely as a team of jailtoreakers,
and all are good actors. E.g., the
women's lead in "Arms and the
Man," which tliey put on last wet k,
is now east as a female hasher, and
other parts are switched around in
the same way. The stars refuse to
take a curia in call without the rest
of Ihe troupe.
Today's matinee and tonight are
the last performances of "The
Dover Road" (which started Mon
day). Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday
matinee and evening, "The Import
ance of lleing Earnest," that prime
.favorite of Wilde's, will he pre
sented. Advance information has it
that the play sparkles throughout
wit. hfine wit and repartee, and that
it .is one of Wilde's best, because
il is not out of date. Also, there, is
a good "tea light" in the lirsf act,
its the English actors call an after
noon tea.
Don't miss a chance to see Harry
Jones, who, with Maurice Col
toourne, is one of the leading lights.
Jones' face and Oolbourne's voice
would fascinate anyone, if you see
"The Dover Road" tonight, 'watch
Jones in the second act, and a free
ticket to the next Camera charity
tight if you can figure out how he
develops such a realistic, racking
cough. Hackstage, right after the
show, he had his natural voice

i hack again, but it was a wonder.
