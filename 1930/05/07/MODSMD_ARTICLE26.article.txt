The Editor, Sir: I
1 rise to protest against ;i certain
letter that was read last night in
the women's living groups concern-!
ing the present agitation over lock- |
outs.
In Die first place, 1 would inquire
just who sent out the letter as it
was written on A.W.S. stationery
and not signed. Then it presup
posed an' attitude on the part of
Women's Conference which has not
even met for two weeks. Sending
out in thi> guise of Conference with
out that, body's sanction is certainly
not in keeping with the orthodox
methods of student government
which Dr. Swain has* been pleading
for.
The letter begins: "Conference J
and Council are glad to have you J
talk over the difficulties which you |
find in ihe present lockout, rules j
and the suggestions that were j
brought, up in the mass meeting. ;
You will be called upon to vote on
the matter later ..."
So WHO, Mr. Editor, is formula!- j
ing the opinion ot' Conference and !
Council for them? If it. is the presi- [
dent of A.W.S. speaking as head j
of the two women's government j
bodies- all well and good -but at !
least such a fact, might, be recog- 1
nized by a signature.
It is my humble opinion that ;
practically every member of the j
five-hundred would be overjoyed to j
get. rid of the boarding school r» gu- j
lations which now govern the wo-,
men. Legislated morals are an in-j

"I RiSE TO PROTEST"

J suit to the intelligence of Stanford
; women who are admittedly in the
! upper ten per cent over the coun
! fry. For grown women to be told
I when to come in is almost ridicu
lous anyway—and yet that laziness, :
I which Bryce says'is the final an-!
! swer to man's submission to politi- j
' cal control —allows the regulations" I
j to persist.
It is not entirely laziness, how- j
lever, and the attitude of the eleven ,
; women's living groups is certainly
i for revision and 2:)!H above all
; things. The ideal situation for Stan- '
j ford would he to have U: .*lo every
| night, but of course the parents of
i Stanford women would raise a tor- j
rible rumpus if their daughters!
were allowed to be inflicted to the 1
J temptations of tliis world full of I
| evil after 1:30. Why Stanford t'Tni- i
! versity must direct its course of j
| action to please the women's par- i
| ents is certainly an amusing siuta- '
tion, to say tlie least.
This freedom is the cry of mod- j
ern youth and il is a freedom
which cries for the right to make I
tip its own mind about morals and j
health. Nature shoves the little |
birds out into the world to shift J
for themselves with the result that i
they become self-reliant and inde
pendent quickly. If Stanford's mis
sion is to send out leaders —it
would certainly help train those |
leaders if the women were allowed
a little moral will and choice for'
themselves. i

The Editor, Sir: I
1 rise to protest against ;i certain
letter that was read last night in
the women's living groups concern-!
ing the present agitation over lock- |
outs.
In Die first place, 1 would inquire
just who sent out the letter as it
was written on A.W.S. stationery
and not signed. Then it presup
posed an' attitude on the part of
Women's Conference which has not
even met for two weeks. Sending
out in thi> guise of Conference with
out that, body's sanction is certainly
not in keeping with the orthodox
methods of student government
which Dr. Swain has* been pleading
for.
The letter begins: "Conference J
and Council are glad to have you J
talk over the difficulties which you |
find in ihe present lockout, rules j
and the suggestions that were j
brought, up in the mass meeting. ;
You will be called upon to vote on
the matter later ..."
So WHO, Mr. Editor, is formula!- j
ing the opinion ot' Conference and !
Council for them? If it. is the presi- [
dent of A.W.S. speaking as head j
of the two women's government j
bodies- all well and good -but at !
least such a fact, might, be recog- 1
nized by a signature.
It is my humble opinion that ;
practically every member of the j
five-hundred would be overjoyed to j
get. rid of the boarding school r» gu- j
lations which now govern the wo-,
men. Legislated morals are an in-j

"I RiSE TO PROTEST"

J suit to the intelligence of Stanford
; women who are admittedly in the
! upper ten per cent over the coun
! fry. For grown women to be told
I when to come in is almost ridicu
lous anyway—and yet that laziness, :
I which Bryce says'is the final an-!
! swer to man's submission to politi- j
' cal control —allows the regulations" I
j to persist.
It is not entirely laziness, how- j
lever, and the attitude of the eleven ,
; women's living groups is certainly
i for revision and 2:)!H above all
; things. The ideal situation for Stan- '
j ford would he to have U: .*lo every
