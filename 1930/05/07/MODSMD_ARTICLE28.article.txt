### Darrell Amyx 
There can be little doubt that
most of you have heard of Frank
Olin Copley, Class Poet of 19H0. In
beginning a new policy of opening
this column to contributions (see
below), it is our great pleasure to
introduce formally the work of Mr.
Copley, who is truly a "gentleman
and a scholar." Hesides being a
fellow-student of the Classics, he is
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and
:iii accomplished musician. Dare we
say that the sonnet which he has
contributed for today represents his
philosophical attitude toward life?
The spow upon the mountain-peak
will melt,
And swell the tiny brooks to
mighty streams;
And dryest earth grows green be
neath the beams
Of favoring sun, when Spring's
new urge is felt.
Buds burst their jackets on the
bleakest tree,
Bulbs, ice-bound, force their prison
doors amain;
The hardest, dryest seeds their life
regain;
However strong the bond, all things
break free.
My heart is wound about with many
plies
Of cimnbi'ous knowledge, laid one
t'other over
In mazy fashion, to defy the knife.
And yet shall I not lift my half
blind eyes
To peek, owl-fashion o'er the dusty
cover
Of dustier book, and sneeze sur
prise at life?
Frank O. Copley.
And, with regard to the contri
butions mentioned above, they may
be mailed to Box (JMS, campus.
Prompt and courteous attention
will be given to all tuss., etc. That's
that.
