For the first time in the history
of American football ;it Stanford
the Cardinal squad lias scheduled
two intersectionai gridiron battles
in one season with different, uni
versities. The first cross-count ry
engagement will come early in tin
year on October II when the Mm
nesota campus playh hnsl to the
Redshirts, and the second will wind
up the 19:10 season when Dart
mouth makes the long journey out
to the Coast for a game on No
vember 29.
Once before, way back in
1904, the Cards played a pair
of intersecticnal tilts, but both
against the same team. That
was Chicago, and the Maroons
grabbed off the opening tussle,
24-4, but bowed iri the second,
12 0.
When Warner's stalwarts journey
back to New Scandinavia, the; Cards
will either be up against a. re
vamped, well-oiled steamroller or a
mediocre, one-lung Ford, probably
the latter.
For the Minneapolis crew is
up against the same situation
as at Washington. Coach Doc
Spears left Minnesota last year
in hopes of gaining new laurels
at Oregon, and now the Go
phers are playing under the
tutelage of head mentor Her
bert "Fritz" Crisler. Like Pha
lan of Washington, Crisler is a
slave-driver and has been work
ing his men very hard during
the spring workouts.
The new coach is having three
big (1 ilTic-vilties: to find a Rood quar
terback, to figure out how to
strengthen his line, and to locate
a pair of good tackles. The Gophers
have always had a bunch of Ail-
Americans Fullback Joesting in
19120 and 1927, Kenny Haycraft in
'2N, and Nagurski and Tanner last,
year. This year they may have one
or two more, but right now it looks
like those two men will be more
than half the team.
One of them is Jack Manders,
husky thunderbolt who plays full
back and appears to have the post
cinched even though he is only a
last year's freshman. The other
bright light is Pete Sommers, a
brilliant, open field runner, whom
Crisler may use to plug up the hole
at quarter. The other two men on
the first string back fie Id are Walt
Hass, a speedy half who recently
competed in the Drake Relays, and
Russ Leksell. Other hopes are Clint
Riebeth, Al Arsenault, and Red
Griffin.
The line seems woefully
weak. Stein, Koski, and Wells
are battling for the pivot posi
tion left vacant by Oja, the
last-named showing up the
best. Reishen, a drop-kicker,
and Greenberg look to be the
outstanding guards at present,
with Boyce and Kroll as the
best bets at tackle. Hoefler and
Gilner are the leading ends.
Most of the players are compara
tively young and inexperienced and
many injuries during the spring
practice have hit the squad pretty
hard. Moth the line and the backs
are weak on the defense, and even
Crisler has small hopes that the
Gophers will be able to startle the
football world in the fall. Added to
that, the original 12. r > that turned
out on the lirst day, March 31, lias
dwindled down miserably.
Practically nothing is known
about the other intersectional foe
that the liedmen will face. Dart
mouth suffered by losing three of
llie best men on the squad and
that may hit them pretty hard.
First of ail ilal I'ooma, All-Ameri
can end, is gone. Then there's Cap
tain Ellsworth Armstrong, and Al
Marsters, who have played their
last game lor the Hanover college.
Reports have it, however, j
that almost all of the rest of
the Green team will return in
tact—so they may turn out
plenty of stiff competition. At
any rate the Dartmouth game
ought to be harder than the
Minnesota fray.
Last year the "Thundering
Herd," as they call it in the Gopher
Prairie towns, took three Big Ten
games fairly easily and lost, a pair
of hair-raisers to lowa and Michi
gan by two- and one-point margins,
respectively. That's not a bad show
ing when one remembers that there
were no Stanford, gravy-train set
ups every other week.
Dartmouth also plays a Notre
Dame schedule every year and
lost only two games, a 16-12
affair to Yale, and a 13-6 tussle
to Navy. And that was largely
due to the loss of Marsters who
was forced out of both games
on injuries. That's not a bad
showing, either.
The fourth article will take up
the prospects of the so-called
smaller fry that the Cardinals will
encounter next fall West Coast
Army, Olympic Club, Santa Clara,
Oregon State, Cal Tech, and

a pair of good tackles. The Gophers
have always had a bunch of Ail-
Americans Fullback Joesting in
19120 and 1927, Kenny Haycraft in
'2N, and Nagurski and Tanner last,
year. This year they may have one
or two more, but right now it looks
like those two men will be more
than half the team.
One of them is Jack Manders,
husky thunderbolt who plays full
back and appears to have the post
cinched even though he is only a
last year's freshman. The other
bright light is Pete Sommers, a
brilliant, open field runner, whom
Crisler may use to plug up the hole
at quarter. The other two men on
the first string back fie Id are Walt
Hass, a speedy half who recently
competed in the Drake Relays, and
Russ Leksell. Other hopes are Clint
Riebeth, Al Arsenault, and Red
Griffin.
The line seems woefully
weak. Stein, Koski, and Wells
are battling for the pivot posi
tion left vacant by Oja, the
last-named showing up the
best. Reishen, a drop-kicker,
and Greenberg look to be the
outstanding guards at present,
with Boyce and Kroll as the
best bets at tackle. Hoefler and
Gilner are the leading ends.
Most of the players are compara
tively young and inexperienced and
many injuries during the spring
practice have hit the squad pretty
hard. Moth the line and the backs
are weak on the defense, and even
Crisler has small hopes that the
Gophers will be able to startle the
football world in the fall. Added to
that, the original 12. r > that turned
out on the lirst day, March 31, lias
dwindled down miserably.
Practically nothing is known
about the other intersectional foe
that the liedmen will face. Dart
mouth suffered by losing three of
llie best men on the squad and
that may hit them pretty hard.
First of ail ilal I'ooma, All-Ameri
can end, is gone. Then there's Cap
tain Ellsworth Armstrong, and Al
Marsters, who have played their
last game lor the Hanover college.
Reports have it, however, j
that almost all of the rest of
the Green team will return in
tact—so they may turn out
plenty of stiff competition. At
any rate the Dartmouth game
ought to be harder than the
Minnesota fray.
Last year the "Thundering
Herd," as they call it in the Gopher
Prairie towns, took three Big Ten
games fairly easily and lost, a pair
of hair-raisers to lowa and Michi
gan by two- and one-point margins,
respectively. That's not a bad show
ing when one remembers that there
were no Stanford, gravy-train set
ups every other week.
Dartmouth also plays a Notre
Dame schedule every year and
lost only two games, a 16-12
affair to Yale, and a 13-6 tussle
to Navy. And that was largely
due to the loss of Marsters who
was forced out of both games
on injuries. That's not a bad
showing, either.

For the first time in the history
of American football ;it Stanford
the Cardinal squad lias scheduled
two intersectionai gridiron battles
in one season with different, uni
versities. The first cross-count ry
engagement will come early in tin
year on October II when the Mm
nesota campus playh hnsl to the
Redshirts, and the second will wind
up the 19:10 season when Dart
mouth makes the long journey out
to the Coast for a game on No
vember 29.
Once before, way back in
1904, the Cards played a pair
of intersecticnal tilts, but both
against the same team. That
was Chicago, and the Maroons
grabbed off the opening tussle,
24-4, but bowed iri the second,
12 0.
When Warner's stalwarts journey
back to New Scandinavia, the; Cards
will either be up against a. re

the latter.

in hopes of gaining new laurels
at Oregon, and now the Go
phers are playing under the

that almost all of the rest of

Last year the "Thundering
Herd," as they call it in the Gopher
Prairie towns, took three Big Ten
games fairly easily and lost, a pair
of hair-raisers to lowa and Michi

were no Stanford, gravy-train set
ups every other week.
Dartmouth also plays a Notre
Dame schedule every year and
lost only two games, a 16-12
affair to Yale, and a 13-6 tussle
to Navy. And that was largely
due to the loss of Marsters who
was forced out of both games
on injuries. That's not a bad
showing, either.

For the first time in the history
of American football ;it Stanford
the Cardinal squad lias scheduled
two intersectionai gridiron battles
in one season with different, uni
versities. The first cross-count ry
engagement will come early in tin
year on October II when the Mm
nesota campus playh hnsl to the
Redshirts, and the second will wind
up the 19:10 season when Dart
mouth makes the long journey out
to the Coast for a game on No
vember 29.
Once before, way back in
1904, the Cards played a pair
of intersecticnal tilts, but both
against the same team. That
was Chicago, and the Maroons
grabbed off the opening tussle,
24-4, but bowed iri the second,
12 0.
When Warner's stalwarts journey
back to New Scandinavia, the; Cards
will either be up against a. re
vamped, well-oiled steamroller or a
mediocre, one-lung Ford, probably
the latter.
For the Minneapolis crew is
up against the same situation
as at Washington. Coach Doc
Spears left Minnesota last year
in hopes of gaining new laurels
at Oregon, and now the Go
phers are playing under the
tutelage of head mentor Her
bert "Fritz" Crisler. Like Pha
lan of Washington, Crisler is a
slave-driver and has been work
ing his men very hard during
the spring workouts.
The new coach is having three
big (1 ilTic-vilties: to find a Rood quar
terback, to figure out how to
strengthen his line, and to locate
a pair of good tackles. The Gophers
have always had a bunch of Ail-
Americans Fullback Joesting in
19120 and 1927, Kenny Haycraft in
'2N, and Nagurski and Tanner last,
year. This year they may have one
or two more, but right now it looks
like those two men will be more
than half the team.
One of them is Jack Manders,
husky thunderbolt who plays full
back and appears to have the post
cinched even though he is only a
last year's freshman. The other
bright light is Pete Sommers, a
brilliant, open field runner, whom
Crisler may use to plug up the hole
at quarter. The other two men on
the first string back fie Id are Walt
Hass, a speedy half who recently
competed in the Drake Relays, and
Russ Leksell. Other hopes are Clint
Riebeth, Al Arsenault, and Red
Griffin.
The line seems woefully
weak. Stein, Koski, and Wells
are battling for the pivot posi
tion left vacant by Oja, the
last-named showing up the
best. Reishen, a drop-kicker,
and Greenberg look to be the
outstanding guards at present,
with Boyce and Kroll as the
best bets at tackle. Hoefler and
Gilner are the leading ends.
Most of the players are compara
tively young and inexperienced and
many injuries during the spring
practice have hit the squad pretty
hard. Moth the line and the backs
are weak on the defense, and even
Crisler has small hopes that the
Gophers will be able to startle the
football world in the fall. Added to
that, the original 12. r > that turned
out on the lirst day, March 31, lias
dwindled down miserably.
