# A 						JIM-OF-ALL-TRADES...
## Star of Last World's Series Enters Thirteenth Year With Connie Mack's American League Champs 
### Feg Murray, '16 
1930 will be Jimmy Dykes' thir-'
teenth season with the Philadel
phia Athletics. Now, thirteen may
be.an unlucky number to some peo
ple. but not for Jimmy Dykes, for
it marks the first year in a long
while in which he will be used as
a regular. For the last, seven sea
sons Dykes has been known as one
of the most versatile of players, a
j lad who could be thrown into the
i breach at a moment's notice any
where in the infield or outfield. He
filled in at first, second, third, or
short, chased flies if needed to sub
for one of the outer-gardeners, and
even pitched one inning in a game
with the Red Sox in J927!
Last season, for instance, the ver
satile Jimmy played second in
twelve games, played third in forty
five, and short in sixty. Along near
the close of the 1929 season he
took ui> his duties at the hot cor
ner, allowing Jimmy Foxx to return
to first, and the A's came out of
a bad slump and hit their winning
| stride once more. The conviction (

wasn't long in growing that Jimmy
was one of the most vital cogs in
Ihe Athletics' machine, and so,
when Connie prepared his team
for the world series with the Cubs,
he kept Dykes at third, and his con
fidence in the boy who learned his
baseball on the sand lots of Philly
was more than justified.
All that "Little Jimmy" did in his
first championship series was to
bat .421, higher than any other
player who wore a Philadelphia
uniform, to field fairly well, to 1
make eight hits, the same number
as Hack Wilson, who led the Cubs
in this respect, and to make him
self "meritoriously conspicuous" by
his valiant playing in every game. I
Dykes' two-bagger in the seventh '
inning of the famous fourth game
scored Simmons and Foxx with the
winning runs, in that rally the like
of which had never before been
witnessed in a world series.
So you see why Connie is plan
ning to use Jimmy regularly at
third this season!
