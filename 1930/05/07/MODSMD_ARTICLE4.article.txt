### 
"Tim administration is in sym
pathy with women discussing their
own regulations and problems,"
said Dean Mary Yost in an inter
view yesterday.
"In considering any proposal it
is necessary to see all angles arid
in order to get all sides we are
holding small group meetings," she
continued. "A discussion group of
parents was held yesterday after
noon, and a meeting of house
mothers is to be held today. Any
girl or group of girls who wishes
to discuss the matter is welcomed
by me, since 1 would like to have
all points brought out.
Stanford's Purpose
"It must be remembered that
this is an educational institution
and that students are here for edu
cational purposes. The University
cannot afford to lower its academic
work, and should be doing even
better than it is now.
"Health is a very vital factor
since it. affects academic success
here and has an effect on life after
wards."

meetings will be continued.
Although probably a definite con
clusion will not be reached, a for
mulating committee will be appoint
ed which will continue investiga

according to Dean Yost.
"There is 110 danger of the mat

pooled intelligence.' "
