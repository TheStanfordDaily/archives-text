# BALL TEAM BUSY IN TRAINING FOR TILT WITH KANSAI
## Stanford Squad To Meet Japanese Outfit at 3:15 Tomorrow 
### 
Failure of the men to show up for
baseball practice lately is consider
ably slowing up Stanford's chances
over the Kansai I'nivcrsity nine sched
uled to face the varsity here at 3:15
o'clock tomorrow. About fifteen toss
ers put in an appearance yesterday,
many of them freshmen who are in
eligible to play in tomorrow's contest.
The only change in Coach Harry
Wolter's lineup is the decision to play
Kelly at third in place of Churchill.
The rest of the infield will be Cook,
Cutshaw, and Johnson in the inlicld,
and llunketi, Rintaki, and llcrg in the
outer gardens. Lcvcreuz and Hardy
arc the choice for the battery.
Captain - elect Jobnm Hunkcn is
having a busy time out there filling in
at all the vacant places. Yesterday
lie warmed up the pitchers, and caught
for inlicld practice.
