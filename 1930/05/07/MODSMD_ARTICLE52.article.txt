# STANFORD GRADUATE THINKS BRITISH RULE IN INDIA IS DOOMED
## Violence Will Break Out Following Gandhi's Arrest—Dixit 
### 
j "British rule in India is doomed;
, it can be prolonged another decade
only through the use of the bloody
sword." So stated Kay Lall Dixit,
Indian education graduate whose
home is in Buland Shallr, India.
■ Dixit says that he is convinced
that "the majority of Indian people
are fully determined to win free
dom for India. "By placing Ma
hal ma Gandhi under arrest matters
will only go from bad to worse for
the British. Although Gandhi be
lieves in non-violence himself and
a large number of his leaders will
try to follow in his foosteps, it
seems to me, in the end violence
i will break out, if it has not already
I done so."
The Indian student denies believ
ing in violence. "If freedom is to be
gotten for India, it will be gained
much earlier with a passive re
sistance than with bloodshed," ln
said.
"During the last 150 years of
j British rule, Hindus have become
[only 10 per cent educated, while
j literacy in the Philippines under
American rule quickly jumped to
more than GO per cent of the popu
lation. Perhaps under self-govern
ment for the Indians there is hope
for education as well as freedom
from taxation of the hungriest
stomachs of the teeming millions."
