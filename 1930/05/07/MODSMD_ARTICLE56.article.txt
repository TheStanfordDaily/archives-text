# ARTHUR BYRON, STAR OF "CRIMINAL CODE", CENSURES PRISON SYSTEM
## 
### BY WILLIAM GRACE 
Up in San Francisco, at tlie
Geary Theatre, there i.s a tragedy
being played, "The Criminal Code,"
written by Martin Flavin. It shows
the bitter, hopeless existence which
is endured by thousands of men in
this country now serving sentences
in our prisons.
Byron as Warden
Playing the role of the warden,
a hard-boiled, cigar-chewing politi
cian, is Arthur Byron, and a talk
with him backstage between acts
revealed the secret of this veteran
actor's convincing portrayal; Byron
is a sincere and intelligent man,
and the social problem of imprison
ing men has "got" him.
'I don't see that we have any
right to deprive our fellow men of
liberty," he said, after going
through San Quentin the other day.
(San Quentin, by the way, inspired
Marvin Flavin lo write this play,
which is being considered for the
Pullitzer prize). "Just to look at the
prisoners' dull eyes and hopeless
expressions makes you shudder and
realize the utter futility of trying
to make law coincide with justice.
"The recent prison breaks and
riots which have occurred all over
the country did not influence Fla
vin, because San Quentin is a
model prison, as much as one of
these 'big houses' can be. The play
hits at the black futility qf it all,
presents the degradation and loss

of self-respect, which 1 believe is
the worst part of imprisonment."
Byron said that one of the most
pitiful things reflecting the result
of prison life is the number of men
actually staying in their cells at
San Quentin now, although they
have been paroled and are free as
the warden himself; but these men
i cannot return to the world. Their

t< rm behind the bars has cut so
deeply tiiat society is impossible.
Prison authorities sire required to |
let them stay the lull term of their J
sentence, although they might have ;
been released early.
"I have been playing comedy
most of my life, and although the I
role of warden in this play is de-1
pressing, it is easier to play than
comedy. It is just like this: an j
onion will make a man cry, but!
what vegetable can make him i
laugh? It is the same idea with I
acting. Next season 1 start a long i
part in Molnar's comedy, 'One, Two,
Three.' "

to make law coincide with justice.
"The recent prison breaks and
riots which have occurred all over
the country did not influence Fla
vin, because San Quentin is a
model prison, as much as one of
these 'big houses' can be. The play
hits at the black futility qf it all,
presents the degradation and loss

of self-respect, which 1 believe is
the worst part of imprisonment."
Byron said that one of the most
pitiful things reflecting the result
of prison life is the number of men
actually staying in their cells at
San Quentin now, although they
have been paroled and are free as
the warden himself; but these men
i cannot return to the world. Their

t< rm behind the bars has cut so
deeply tiiat society is impossible.
Prison authorities sire required to |
let them stay the lull term of their J
sentence, although they might have ;
been released early.
"I have been playing comedy
most of my life, and although the I
role of warden in this play is de-1
pressing, it is easier to play than
comedy. It is just like this: an j
onion will make a man cry, but!
what vegetable can make him i
laugh? It is the same idea with I
acting. Next season 1 start a long i
part in Molnar's comedy, 'One, Two,
Three.' "
