### 
WASHINGTON, May 7. (£>)— For
the first: time in tliii-ty-six years
the Senate t.o(i;iy refused 1o con
linn a nominee to the Supreme
Court, rejecting Judge John J. Par
ker, of North Carolina, by a vote
of 41 to 39.
The decision forces President
Hoover to look elsewhere for a man
lo tnke the seat made vacant hy
tlie death of Associate Justice Ed-
Ward T. Sanford, of Tennessee, but
there was no indication tonight lie
had a nominee in mind.
There were intimations from the
White House that Mr. Hoover
would have something to say about,
the Senate's action and that he
would not go again to the South
for a nominee. It was believed, also,
that lie would not reappoint Par
ker. by whom he stood firmly in
the Senate controversy.
Opposition to Parker in the Sen
ate was led by Senators Borah, of
Idaho, and Norris, of Nebraska,
both Republicans, and their plea
for his rejection was based entire
ly upon his decision upholding an
injunction restraining the United
Mine Workers from soliciting mem
bership among miners who had
signed contracts with their em
ployers not to join the union.
A.F.L. Protests
The American Federation of La
bor vigorously protested the nom
ination. The National Association
for the Advancement of the Colored
People also protested a speech
made by Parker as Republican Gu
bernatorial candidate in 1920 in
which he was charged with saying
the negroes were not ready to*as
sume the burdens and responsibili
ties of government.
The combined opposition of these
two groups split the administration
Republican ranks and brought
about the defeat.
Parker was supported by 29 Re
publicans and 10 Democrats, while
17 Republicans, 2:! Democrats, and
the lone Farmer-Labor senator op
posed him.
The vote was one of the closest
and the fight was one of the most
hotly contested of any in recent
Senate history.
