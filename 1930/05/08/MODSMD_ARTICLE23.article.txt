# TROOPS CONTROL INDIAN REVOLTS
## Outbreaks Mark Turn Of Gandhi Campaign 
### 
BOMBAY, India, May 7. (&)â€”An
I almost endless list of outbreaks to
i day marked the turning of the im
j prisoned Mahatma Gandhi's cam-
I paign of civil disobedience from
l peaceful into warlike progress,
i Bloodshed occurred in a dozen
i cities where hostile actions of the
I "Holy One's" followers were met
| with armed force.
I The Home and Indian govern
j ments strengthened the hands of
'local police authorities with troops
i and armored cars.
Outstanding among the day's
! disorders was a clash at Delhi in
(which two natives were killed and
| fifty or more seriously wounded.
jA half-mile procession of Chandi's
j devotees filed into the city's prin
jcipal thoroughfare, Ghandi Chowk,
| refusing to disperse.
With this group the authorities
; grappled for several hours, finally
1 being obliged to seek the aid of
j cavalry troops, who gained control
i of Ihe sil uation.
Following the Delhi disturbances
I the police proclaimed a state of
j martial law, forbidding the gather
ing of more than five persons, En
j forcement of this statute through
| out India would necessitate mobili
j zation of every available troop,
I both European and native.
Meanwhile the central figure in
j this turbulent picture remained re
mote from strife within the eneir-
I cling walls of the Poomi jail where,
[according to latesi information, he
j was well and cheerful.
