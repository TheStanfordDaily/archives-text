# AGAIN, THE HONOR CODE
## 
### 
I <'in the Honor Code survive?
I hat question has been raised periodically since Stanford put
its academic life on a basis of honor. Sometimes the answer has
heen negative; sometimes it has been affirmative.
\ I ways there has heen an earnest group, believing stronglv in
the Code and bending every effort to make it a workable thing. In
.i tneasuie their efforts have been successiul: and in a measure thev
have failed.
Today proponents of the ('ode. and those who believe that the
[•I inciple ot honor is practical as a guide to conduct in the class '
rooms of this I niversity, are encouraged in their belief.
I hey are encouraged because a group of student leaders has
taken a definite and firm stand tor the building of a more successful!
J lonor Code.
I 1 edged to turn in tcllow students who arc guilty of violations
<u the I lonoi Code, this band of students has taken a much needed
and long desired step. Ii is generally admitted that reluctance to
upon violators has loomed as the most serious stumbling block in
the way to success.
Xow that campus leaders have moved to remedv this lethargy!
much can he expected lor the betterment of existing conditions.
I hit the ones who have already taken the step cannot complete the
work alone. Their action will he helpful—it will he invaluable—but
tluir action must be followed by the action of others.
I he Daii.v congratulates those men and women for their action,
i is one ot the most progressive steps taken on this campus in many
years. A great deal of good will undoubtedly come of it.
In pursuance of the belief that their action must he followed by
the action of others, the Daily opens its columns to those who desire I
to express a similar opinion; and further, the Daii.v urges that j
students make use. of this oiler. Sincere expressions of opinion in
this matter will do much to accomplish the desired end.
Such an expression 'definitely blows up the stupid idea that some
sort of social stigma attaches itself to the person who turns in a
violator of the Honor Code. If those who signed the resolution can '
afford* to pledge themselves to such a course, surelv others can
a fiord to do likewise.
