# JUNIOR FESTIVITIES
## 
### 
I he Daily lias seldom, if ever, moaned for the ''good old days." !
Hut there are times when the enthusiasm and naivete of yester-'
year would he a welcome change. Sophistication and complacency I
have their good points. It might even be said that in the main
these two qualities are to he much more desired than the rah-rahisms !
of the past.
< k'casionally, however, they seem to he a trifle too predominant!
in the student make-up.
l ake, for instance, the ancient custom of Junior Week, junior i
Week is a time set aside each v«\ar for merry-making and festive!
spirit. It is particularly meant for juniors, but the whole campus
usually supports the movement and takes part in its various features. '
The most prominent and attended events of the Junior Week
program are usually the * )pera and the I'rom. According to reports
trom the committees which are arranging these twr/ affairs, the
student support has been very poor.
Junior Week in general, and the I'rom and Opera in particular,
are not worn-out traditions. They are still as valuable parts of
student life as they ever were.
If Stanford students want to preserve the social spirit of this
campus they will not become lackadaisical at this time. This campus
•ocial spirit of which wc speak is becoming more and more difficult
to maintain, as the motor car takes its ever-increasing trill and as
the diminution of the Lower Division becomes a fact.
It seems, to the Daily, a very vital and desirable thing, worth
preserving.
