GALLOWS' ORCHARD. By Claire
Spencer. Jonathan Cape and
Smith. New York. 1930.
Christopher .Vlorley, in his review
of Gallows' Orchard by Claire Spen
cer, says lhat the nicest thing that
he fun think of, next to being rich,
is to help some splendid, humble
hook on to its proud destiny. He
has chosen to give Gallows* Orch
! ard this rare backing and he has
selected wisely.
For indeed, Claire Spencer has
produced a story of consummate
strength with a vitality that enters
thoroughly into the'reader's activi
ties. From Morley's much-quoted
review in the "Saturday Review of
Literature" are these paragraphs:
"Genius is this that you sudden
ly see a thing done as it was never
j quite done before. You are aston
ished and at the same time you
recognize the riglitness of it; you
feel pride for the. person who was
simple and intuitive enough to
know that was how it needed*to
be done.
"It is a Scottish book and Scots
are known to be fey (or is it datt?).
Ii has the absolute quality of Scot
land in it, strong and riotous with
life as ripe old Scotch whiskey;
the sweet gnarly queerness of Scots
air and feeling."
Perhaps one of Hie most amaz
ing things about this story of the
tragedy of ElTie 'Gallows, the sim
ple, clear-seeing, strong young girl
who is the book, is the fact that
Claire Spencer, lias been able to
enter so perfectly into the charac
ter of a man as she tells her story
i thfough the young village school
teacher.
Once Effie is saying, "I believe
if people are low in their hearts
they can do low things and not
hurt themselves, and never be pun
ished. but when you know when a
thing is wrong and still you do it,
you are doomed. There's no such
tiling as repentance; when it thing
is started it has to work itself ouL"
Arid a description from near the
end of the tale: "1 am running;

I back to you luster than 1 evei
knew I could run. I have strong
muscled legs that force the ground
behind me. I l'elt them as 1 ran,
and I could feel the muscles hard
as iron. 1 laughed again out ot
happy pride. The air (ills my lungs,
cold and fresh, and comes out again
i broad and even. I am like ;i line
machine, accurately strong, mathematically
'matically reckless, ploughing down
the road, levelling down the land
scape. banishing trees and land
marks as I run, rolling up yard af
ter yard of stone dike. And when
I come lo your gate I leave nothing
behind me; 1 bring ii all to you.
! every stick and stone, for I have
conquered them and slashed them
'and destroyed them, all to get to
you." —It. L. B.
THE VAGABOND KING—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
That this picture reaches a pin
nacle in movie achievement from
the standpoint of sheer beauty can
not be questioned. The marvel of
'its technicolor effects, its magnifi
cent music and ils incredibly rich
and lavish pageantry—even though
sometimes a little over-lavish and
colorful—make the Vagabond King
la really superb production.
Denis King is a consummately
fine actor as well as a splendid
I singer, playing the part of the "sol
dier, poet, drinker, Francois Villon,
- the greatest swordsman, and the
greatest lover of France," with a
feeling for the drama of it that is
rather breathtakingly good. Rival
ling his performance is the brilliant
characterization of King Louis.
Warner Gland's acting throughout
is almost without a flaw.
The Vagabond King is the most
thrilling and beautiful picture of
the year. Somehow it lias managed
to concentrate all of the glamour
and romance which clings around
the name of Francois Villon, and
not a little of tragedy, and ihe re
sult is a picture that you will be
very, very foolish to miss.
—M. L. R.
