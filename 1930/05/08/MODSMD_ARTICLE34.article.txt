# ENGINEERING SCHOOL CONSIDERS PROBLEM OF VIBRATION IN MODEL STRUCTURES
## 
### BY W.A. ROBERTS 
That vibration is a dangerous
factor in engineering, is the opinion
of Dr. Bailey Willis, professor
emeritus of geology and authority
on earthquakes. With this idea in
mind, Dr. Willis suggested to the
School of .Engineering in 1t)26, that
vibration experiments with models
of practical engineering structures
be made. For the past two years,
Professor L. S. Jacobsen Has been
conducting experiments in the field
of vibration with an unique device
called a "shaking table."
The "shaking table" consists of
a large steel flat car on which is
mounted the object to be tested. By
specially designed apparatus, the
table can bo made to vibrate con
tinuously or it can be made to vi
brate by an initial shock as would
occur in the case of an earthquake.
Professor Jacobsen hopes that
the experiments may lead to a bet
ter knowledge of how to build
economically structures capable of

! resisting general vibration and sud
| den earthquake shocks. "To study
j engineering structures built on a
Ismail scale to fit our 'shaking
: table,' and to calculate from these
miniature models what, will happen
| to full scale structures When sub
jected to similar vibrations is our
| principal aim," said Professor
1 Jacobsen.
He added that the possibilities
jof further study of vibration phe
nomena other than earthquakes are
j practically unlimited. During the
next few years he hopes that
I sttufies of vibrations of vehicles,
dams, and bridges will be made.
