REGRET, spelled with capi
tal letters, fills the mind of Mr.
Robert Lyman Templeton,
coach of the Stanford track
and field luminaries, each time
he succumbs to the temptation
to envision the potentialities
of the Cardinal spikesters were
Leslie "Abe" Hables eligible.
Not that the 1930 season has to
date been anything but suc
cessful, nor that prospects for
the remaining tilts are at all
gloomy. In fact, we have it on
the authority of none other
than Downhearted Dean Crom
well of Southern California that
Stanford is a cinch to cop their
fourth consecutive (.C.4-A. title.
But the recollection of Hables
breaking the tape in the century
in 9.5 seconds and then placing a
good second in a 20.8 seconds 220
iit Kezar stadium last Saturday,
plus Hie knowledge that Abe's real
talent is for the quarter-mile im
mediately conjures in Mr. Temple
ion's mind a figure representing
sufficient points to put, on ice any
track contests remaining on the*
Cardinal schedule. And the thought
of Leslie running the mile relap in
company with Brother Ike, Mavnor
Shove, and Johnny Mprrifcon rates
light alongside of the vision of
shooting 1 lie Stanford golf course
in par.
Despite that little matter of
ineligibility, Les Hables is not
lacking for competition of iate.
A telegram received yesterday
by Mr. Templeton contained an
offer made by one J. Phillip
Ellsworth, graduate manager of
Occidental College, to pay the
expenses of Hables, Harlow
Rothert, and Eric Krenz should
they wish to travel to Occi
dental this week to compete in
the Southern Pacific Associa
tion of the A.A.U. meet being
held at Eagle Rock this Satur
day.
Hables, who is anxious to again
run against Frank Wykoff, and
Rothert, who has acquired a great
fondness for his perpetual com
petitor, Herman Brix, have signi
fied their desire to compete and
will leave the campus today or to
morrow. Krenz has decided to save
his efforts for the California Inter
collegiates nexl week and will not
mnke the trip.
Correcting an error made
yesterday in another column of
this page, we wish to inform
the eagerly awaiting multitude
that the seniors have already
cinched the interclass cham
pionship. By virtue of 4 points
gained by a tie with the jun
iors for first place in soccer
the 1930 men's total is 22
points. The juniors are in sec
ond place with 15/ 2 points, fol
lowed by the freshmen with
14'/2 points, with the sopho
mores trailing with 11 counts.
A victory in tennis, the remain
ing sport on the interclass
schedule, would give the class
of 1931 a total of only 20'/ 2
points.

day.
Hables, who is anxious to again
run against Frank Wykoff, and
Rothert, who has acquired a great
fondness for his perpetual com
petitor, Herman Brix, have signi
fied their desire to compete and
will leave the campus today or to
morrow. Krenz has decided to save
his efforts for the California Inter
collegiates nexl week and will not
mnke the trip.
Correcting an error made
yesterday in another column of
this page, we wish to inform
the eagerly awaiting multitude
that the seniors have already
cinched the interclass cham
pionship. By virtue of 4 points
gained by a tie with the jun
iors for first place in soccer
the 1930 men's total is 22
points. The juniors are in sec
ond place with 15/ 2 points, fol
lowed by the freshmen with
14'/2 points, with the sopho
mores trailing with 11 counts.
A victory in tennis, the remain
ing sport on the interclass
schedule, would give the class
of 1931 a total of only 20'/ 2
points.

REGRET, spelled with capi
tal letters, fills the mind of Mr.
Robert Lyman Templeton,
coach of the Stanford track
and field luminaries, each time
he succumbs to the temptation
to envision the potentialities
of the Cardinal spikesters were
Leslie "Abe" Hables eligible.
Not that the 1930 season has to
date been anything but suc
cessful, nor that prospects for
the remaining tilts are at all
gloomy. In fact, we have it on
the authority of none other
than Downhearted Dean Crom
well of Southern California that
Stanford is a cinch to cop their
fourth consecutive (.C.4-A. title.
But the recollection of Hables
breaking the tape in the century
in 9.5 seconds and then placing a
good second in a 20.8 seconds 220
iit Kezar stadium last Saturday,
plus Hie knowledge that Abe's real
talent is for the quarter-mile im
mediately conjures in Mr. Temple
ion's mind a figure representing
sufficient points to put, on ice any
track contests remaining on the*
Cardinal schedule. And the thought
of Leslie running the mile relap in
company with Brother Ike, Mavnor
Shove, and Johnny Mprrifcon rates
light alongside of the vision of
shooting 1 lie Stanford golf course
in par.
Despite that little matter of
ineligibility, Les Hables is not
lacking for competition of iate.
A telegram received yesterday
by Mr. Templeton contained an
offer made by one J. Phillip
Ellsworth, graduate manager of
Occidental College, to pay the
expenses of Hables, Harlow
Rothert, and Eric Krenz should
they wish to travel to Occi
dental this week to compete in
the Southern Pacific Associa
tion of the A.A.U. meet being
held at Eagle Rock this Satur
day.
