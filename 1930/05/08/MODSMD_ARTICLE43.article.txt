# Cards Face Japanese Nine Today
## TILT WITH KANSAI OUTFIT TO CLOSE BASEBALL SEASON Redshirts Are Favorites; Leverenz and Hardy Slated to Start 
### 
Taking (he field promptly at 3:15
o'clock this afternoon, Stanford's
baseball varsity will close up the
horsehide season against the Kan
sai University of Japan. Following
today's game, the varsity will turn
out three times a week for prac
tice until the end of the quarter.
The Kansai outfit sailed from
Osaka about a month ago bound on
a barnstorming tour of the coast.
After losing to the University of
( Washington nine by a score of Â»!
to 1, the Nipponese played a few
tilts with Japanese aggregations
about the Puget Sound region and
then came down to California. Fol
lowing their game with the Card
inals, the Kansai men will leave
for the Southland for a few con
tests around Los Angeles and then
] sail for the Orient on May 20.
The team will arrive on the cam
pus early this morning to look
over t lie University before trotting
out on t lie varsity diamond. Prac
tically nothing is known of the
Nippon crew. It is, like all Japa
nese teams, composed of short men,
but who make up their small height
in speed.
Lefty Leverenz is slated to so
in the box for the Cards. Leverenr
finished the Conference season with
three victories and no defeats and
should be able to hold down the
opposition to few hits. Spud Hardy
will receive Leverenz's slants,
j Cook will hold down first, Cutshaw
will be on second, Kelly will han
dle third, and Johnson will be at
short. Hunken, Rintala, and Berg
will patrol the strawberry patches.
Presence of only a few of the
men has slowed up practice as well
as the cold spell and the high wind
ithe last few days, but taking all
i in all. t lie Red shirts should be able
to defeat the barnstormers.
