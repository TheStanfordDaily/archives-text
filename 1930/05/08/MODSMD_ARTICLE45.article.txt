# HERMAN THE GREAT...
## Irish Shot-Putters of Decade Ago Give Way to Hefty Germans; Hermie Brix Looks Good to Feg 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Shot-putters are different, nowa
days. They all used to be fat und
they all used to bo Irish. Now (he
stars are all either German or of
German descent and there's not a
pot-belly in the crowd. The Hirsch
felds, Kucks, Brixes, Housers,
Schwarzies, Krenzes, and Rotlierts
have replaced the Flanagans. Roses,
McDonalds, Sheridans, Ryans, Mc-
Graths, and Duncans. (Ves, Dun
can was Irish, too.) The Germans
have surpassed the best Irish marks
at everything except throwing the
hammer.
All the first-mentioned shot-put
ters have put the 16-pound ball a
distance of 50 feet or better, and
all but "Bud" Houser and Herb
Schwarzie have surpassed 51 feet.
When you consider that, Ralph
Rose's former world's record of 51
feet, made in 1909, was not broken
until 1928, you realize that the
weightmen around nowadays are
the greatest bunch in the history
of athletics.
Take Herman Brix, for instance.
He is a tall, broad, well-built, flue
looking boy, who played tackle for
Enoch Bag.shaw's University of
Washington team in 1925, '26, and
'27, and did not jump into real fame
as a weight-thrower until the Olym
pic tryouts in 1928. He won the
national championships (also the
final tryouts for the games in Am
sterdam) that year with a heave
of 50 feet 11% inches, and then
took second to Johnny Kuck in
the Olympics with a put of 51 feet
8 inches, beating Hirschfeld of Ger

1 many, who then held the world's
record, by two inches!
Brix settled in Southern Califor
nia, where he now represents the
Los Angeles Athletic Club. He re
tained his national title in Denver
last summer with a mark of 50 feet
2Vz inches, beating Stanford's two
Intercollegiate champions, Rothert
and Krenz. His American record of
51 feet 11% inches was made at
Fresno in April of last year. This
year Herm started out with a put
of 51 feet 7 inches in the Southern
Pacific A.A.U. relays, and then
came his first defeat in a long lime,
and at the hands of another foot
ball player, too. Harlow Rothert, of
Stanford, beat him in the L.A.A.C.-
Stanford dual meet on March 1,
with a throw of 51 feet 8 inches.
Brix was second with 51:4%, and
Krenz of Stanford third with 01
feet J 8 inch. It was the only time,
except at Amsterdam, ihat. three
men had beaten 51 feet in the same
competition!

Stanford dual meet on March 1,
with a throw of 51 feet 8 inches.
Brix was second with 51:4%, and
Krenz of Stanford third with 01
feet J 8 inch. It was the only time,
except at Amsterdam, ihat. three
men had beaten 51 feet in the same
competition!

Shot-putters are different, nowa
days. They all used to be fat und
they all used to bo Irish. Now (he
stars are all either German or of
German descent and there's not a
pot-belly in the crowd. The Hirsch
felds, Kucks, Brixes, Housers,
Schwarzies, Krenzes, and Rotlierts
have replaced the Flanagans. Roses,
McDonalds, Sheridans, Ryans, Mc-
Graths, and Duncans. (Ves, Dun
can was Irish, too.) The Germans
have surpassed the best Irish marks
at everything except throwing the
hammer.
All the first-mentioned shot-put
ters have put the 16-pound ball a
distance of 50 feet or better, and
all but "Bud" Houser and Herb
Schwarzie have surpassed 51 feet.
When you consider that, Ralph
Rose's former world's record of 51
feet, made in 1909, was not broken
until 1928, you realize that the
weightmen around nowadays are
the greatest bunch in the history
of athletics.
Take Herman Brix, for instance.
He is a tall, broad, well-built, flue
looking boy, who played tackle for
Enoch Bag.shaw's University of
Washington team in 1925, '26, and
'27, and did not jump into real fame
as a weight-thrower until the Olym
pic tryouts in 1928. He won the
national championships (also the
final tryouts for the games in Am
sterdam) that year with a heave
of 50 feet 11% inches, and then
took second to Johnny Kuck in
the Olympics with a put of 51 feet
8 inches, beating Hirschfeld of Ger

1 many, who then held the world's
record, by two inches!
Brix settled in Southern Califor
nia, where he now represents the
Los Angeles Athletic Club. He re
tained his national title in Denver
last summer with a mark of 50 feet
2Vz inches, beating Stanford's two
Intercollegiate champions, Rothert
and Krenz. His American record of
51 feet 11% inches was made at
Fresno in April of last year. This
year Herm started out with a put
of 51 feet 7 inches in the Southern
Pacific A.A.U. relays, and then
came his first defeat in a long lime,
and at the hands of another foot
ball player, too. Harlow Rothert, of
Stanford, beat him in the L.A.A.C.-
