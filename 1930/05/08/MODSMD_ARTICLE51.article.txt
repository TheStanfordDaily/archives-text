# PLUS-MINUS GRADE SYSTEM IS SUCCESS AT OBERLIN – CHAPIN
## Eastern Professor Says The Standard Of Work Is Not Lower 
### Leonard Effron 
"The installation of the plus and
minus grading system which was
made ;it Oberlin University in
]!)28, lo replace the system of nu
merical or alphabetic grading has
been entirely satisfactory," stated
William 11. Chapin, professor of
chemistry at Oberlin and author of
chemistry textbooks, recently. Pro
fessor Chapin is now visiting Stan
ford while on sabbatical leave from
Oberlin.
"The number of flunking grades
issued has not increased and the
standard of work has not been
lowered. Everyone seems to go in
Ihe same way that they did before
the change was made. Even in re
quired courses, where the oppon
ents of the system believed that
the Jlunk-or-pass would lead to a!
poorer quality of work from the ;
average student, the change lias j
not been great.
"One marked advantage of the 1
new grading system is that it. does \
away with invidious distinctions, •
such as were often made in the
past."
Stanford Pleases
When asked his opinion of Stan- J
ford, Professor Chapin replied: ;
"My impression of Stanford is so j
favorable that I have had my son I
send in his application for admis- i
sion to the engineering school here. I
The fact that Stanford has small i
classes where it is possible for the j
teacher to give personal attention i
to his pupils is one of great im- j
portance and advantage.
"The Stanford chemistry depart- j
ment is one of the tinest anywhere. ,
I am especially interested in tin
great amount of research work 1
being done here in colloids and i
agricultural problems."
