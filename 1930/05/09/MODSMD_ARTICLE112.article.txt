# ILLINOIS SCIENTIST DISCOVERS METAL OF GREAT VALUE
## New Element Given Name Illinium in Honor of Eastern University 
### WILLIAM WALLS 
1^ i'. 15. Smith Hopkins, the onb
American scientist who has discovere<
and named onr of the earth's ele
inents, visited friends and ae(|uain
tanees on the campus recently. He i;
credited with having first isolated am
named the rare earth metal Illinium
"Until recently there was a blanl>
space in the atomic chart of the ran
earth family ot metals and chemist;
only knew that there should be one
with certain properties already fore
cast." said Dr. Hopkins in an inter
view for the Daily.
"We were working at first just t<
increase knowledge concerning tin
known metals of this group. Jn oin
study of these certain wave length
not accounted for were found am
naturalh ascribed to an 'unknown' ir
the materials.
"Then came the difficulty of separ
ation. These elements are called 'ran
earth' metals not so much because ot
their scarcity as the difficulty of sepa
ration and isolation. ]!y using tin
differences in solubilities of salts of
the metals we were finally successful
''One of the original solutions from
which we gained the new element ha<
been going through purification pro
cesses for 14 years. Our predecessors
had therefore set the way for out
success.
"It will not be until larger quanti
ties are obtainable that the commercial
value and perhaps medicinal proper
ties of Illinium can be found. The
problem now is to find more and better
source* of the metal since thu onl\
one now known is a deposit of Mon
a/.ite I'rwm which most of the rare
earth metals are now gotten. Some of
the derivatives ot Monazite are used
to make gas mantles for illumination,
cigarette lighters and 'tracer' bullets."
The author of many treatises on the
rarer elements and of several college
texts. Dr. Hopkins has spent a year
of sabbatical leave in California writ
ing a book on general chemistry and
will return to live University of Illi
nois where he is a professor of inor
ganic chemjstry. for the summer quar
ter.
