# THE 						AGE LIMIT IN SPORTS—IS THERE ONE?
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
The recent victory in the annual
Patriots' Day marathon in Boston
of 41-year-old Clarence DeMar has i
given rise to much discussion as to
just what is the age limit in sports, j
and for how long a span of years j
an athlete may go on winning. This j
span varies, of course, depending !
on the person and on the line of
athletic endeavor in which he com-1
petes. Let us take a look at seven
sports, and try to ascertain in
which one man or woman may keep
up Ihe longest active participation.
BOXING —Some fighters enjoy
great, longevity in the ring. Others
shoot up like a rocket, become
champions, and are forgotten in a
few years. Paul Berlenbach, for in- j
stance. But 34 years elapsed be
tween Bob Fitzsimmon's first ring]

victory in New Zealand and his i
! last light in a 6-rouml, no-decision
I bout with K.O. Sweeney in 1!»J4.
BASEBALL Cv Voting pitched
j for 22 seasons in t lie majors. Tv
, Cobb played for 21 years of service
jin pro baseball when he quit in
; IS!'?, 22 of them spent in the ;
majors. Eddie Collins, still on the
I active list of the Athletics, is in
, liis 2.'! rd major league season. There;
'•are at least five stars in Ihe big;
leagues today who aye past forty.
FOOTBALL Jim Thorpe, 'way
past his prime, may be expected to
play a few games with some pro
team again next fall. His gridiron I
I career started in 1!>08.
GOLF- John Ball, of England, J
finished sixth in the British open
J championship when lie was 1;3 I

| years old, and won tlie amateur
title tor the eighth time .'{4 years
later! Mrs. Caleb Fox, "The Grand
Old Lady of Golf," was a promi
nent figure at every important wo
men's golf match in America for 114
| years. She qualified for the nation
al championship 23 times, but
never won the title. Men in the
eighties play golf frequently, and
i there is no reason why Bobby
| Jones, who could shoot, in the 60's
when he was thirteen, should not
continue to win major champion
ships for 40 years.
TENNIS "Ma" Dundy and Mrs.
| Wight man have been winning tour
naments in this country for around
j 25 years, but an English girl, Miss
j Diugley. who later became Mrs.
i Hillyard, first won at Wimbledon

I in lSSti and was still playing in the
championship in 1912, 26 years
S later. King Gustav of Sweden plays
j regularly on the ltiviera and he is
73. So Tilden may look forward to
35 years more!
WRESTLING- "Grandpa" Zbysz
ko won the heavyweight title when
he was past 50. He and Poddubney
met in a terrific mat encounter in
i 1 DOG, and again 20 years later.
TRACK AND FIELD —Some run
ners improve with age. DeMar's
j seventh Boston marathon victory
was his fastest. Pat McDonald and
Matt McGrath, famous New Yor,k
"Whales," are both over 54 and
I still win weight-throwing cham
pionships for the New York A.C.
J It would seem that the life of
I an athlete is longest in golf.
