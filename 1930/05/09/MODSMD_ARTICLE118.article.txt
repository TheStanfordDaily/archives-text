# MEXICANS FORMING PARTY TO SEARCH FOR INDIAN KILLERS
## 
### 
: DOUCI.AS. Ariz., May 8 (/P>.—
| I)etenniue<l to exterminate the Apache
i Indian band which murdered Mrs.
I Francisco Fimbres, a party of Mexi
|cans are organizing a w inter watch at
| the portals of a deep set canyon in
i the Sierra Mad re mountains.
I At their bead is Francisco Fimbres,
i husband of the slain woman and fa-•
titer of their young son, who disap
i pea red at the time the Indian outlaws
i raided the Fimbres ranch three years
: '' .
! I In civilian party w ill be supple
mented in the spring by a unit of tile
federal Mexican army, bringing the
total besieging force to approximately
000.
Relentlessly since the visitation of
savagery, Fimbres has,stalked the ma
rauders of his peaceful rancho. Only
(the recent Mexican revolution inter- j
ruptcd him.
Recently he succeeded in spotting
his prey in a camp in the Canyon of
the ( aves. The heavy snows and
steip walls of the canyon afford a
natural protection which would make
an attack suicidal, but the rigors of
winter and the closing of the mountain
passes will, he believes, pen in his
| quarry until spring.
Fncatnped at the mouth of the can
' vo.n, Fimbres and his friends will
await the breakup of winter and at
the first opportunity they will strike.
Hloodhonnds, backwoodsmen, and,

cowboys have helped Fimbres in his
numerous expeditions in pursuit of the
Apaches.
Rogerio l.oreto, president ot Agua
Prieta, used his influence to obtain
from the Mexican government permits
for Fimbres to wage war on the out
laws and help in the organizations of
the stalking posses.
One expedition a year ago carried
Fimbres and his men through tortu
ous mountain trails and deep snows to
altitudes of 10,;;()0 feet, but they found
only abandoned camplires.
From time to time, fairly authentic
reports have been received that a white
child has been seen in the company of
the Apaches and Fimbres holds to the
hope that his son has been kept in the
custody of the red men, to be raised
as a member of the tribe, and that he
can be rescued when the besieged
camp can be taken. The child was two
when be disappeared.
A two-year-old sister was spared by
the raiders of the Fimbres ranch but
the mother's mutilated body was found
by the husband when he returned home
alter an absence of a few days.
