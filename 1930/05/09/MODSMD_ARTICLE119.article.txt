# ROBLE HALL PLANS ANNUAL DECK DANCE
## 
### 
Roble Hall will give its annual Deck
Dance this coming Wednesday evening
from 7 to 8, weather permitting. The
dance is an outdoor affair and will be
held on the second floor sun-porch
which overlooks Lagunita.
Spring decorations will be used for
the dance. Committees have begun
work, and the only necessity is a
warm, balmy evening to assure the
dance of success.
