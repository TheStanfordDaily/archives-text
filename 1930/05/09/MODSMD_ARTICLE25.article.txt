## 
### REID BRIGGS 
That the need for proper housing
facilities for graduate women pre
sents a very pressing problem, is the
opinion of Dean of Women Mary
Yost, as expressed in her annual re
port. "With the increasing emphasis
that the I Diversity is putting on grad- ,
ualc work, it becomes more and more
important «to provide living conditions
which will draw tin best type ol stir
dents."
Last Year, Maiuanita Hall, the old
Jordan home, bad to be abandoned. !
It was necessarj to crowd under- |
graduates into Koble by putting three
students in most of the two-occupant
suites.
"Not onh did this make unfortun
ate physical conditions for all," con
tinued Miss Yost, "but a large under
graduate dormitory is no place for
graduate students to do their best
work in. Madrono llall, a pri\at«.
boarding bouse oil flic campus, holts-;
cd oiih about J(l graduates; nio>l of ,
these had to live two-in-a-rooin.
"A survey was made of the rooms |
in Palo Alto which had been listed in
the Dean of Women's nflice, and this
survey revealed, on the whole, very
poor rooms and often ven expensive |
ones."
A committee of graduate women !
studied the situation, and reported to
the dean that provision be made for
these tsudents in the l-nivcrsitv build I

inn program. A portion of there- j
port follows:
"It is suggested that the graduate :
women be housed in three units group- ;
ed about a court, such as the I tmoti
group. One unit wotdd contain single j
rooms and Ik- provided with a central
dinin ghall; a s< , cond unit would con- |
tain two-and three-person apartments j
fot unmarried graduate women, \\ho|
ma> either elect to do their own cook- J
inn i>r to board at the centra) dining
hall; a third unit would contain both j
rooms and small apartments to ae- ,
cummodatemarrie d graduate couples. I
"Klaborate accommodations arc not
requested b> the graduate women, but j
adequate facilities provided by the
I 'nivcrsity upon a non-profit basis i
are desired.
"Convinced that the present condi
tion of graduate women's living <|tiai i
let s demand mole immediate atten- i
lion than the plan provides, we pro
pose that for temporary relief the !
I 'nivcrsity a-sunic management of any j
available house with dining rooms on
the campus and offer to the graduate
women board and room at a cost '
which i> comparable with that at prcs- |
cut enjoyed by the undergraduate wo
men."
