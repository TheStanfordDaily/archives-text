# SUMMER WORK WILL PRESENT VARIED TOPICS
## Stanford Summer School Only One To Increase Enrollment Last Year More Than 1400 Attended In 1929; Student Body Shows Steady Growth 
### 
J lie summer quarter this year
offers a program, marked as is en:,
tomary by a large, number of emi
nent scholars from other American
universities and abroad culled in 1.0
supplement the University's own
! faculty, but so varied in under
I graduate work as well as graduate
that a satisfactory schedule can b"
I arranged for the average student
j working toward liis A.B. degree in
most departments. In some depart
| meats the work offered is ev< n
j more Comprehensive than in otliei
I quarters.
So far as can be judged from
i present indications enrollment next
; quarter will keep pace with recent
j summer quarter enrollment. Last.
I year Stanford was the only univer
I sity in California to have a larger
■ student bouy than in the summer
I before, and in the country as a
j whole the trend was downward.
: 'I he enrollment here last summer
; was slightly more than 1400.
There has been a fairly steady
j increase in attendance in the sum
I mer quarter ever since it was in
{stituted at Stanford a little more
j than a decade ago, with no in
j stance of any year falling below
I the year before. In the live year:
• ending last, summer the increase
j was more than fifty per cent.
In recent years there has been ;i
I lendency for more Stanford in
; dents of other quarters to continue
j work in the summer, and it is ex
i pected that this trend will continue
| this year.
It is thought that the added fa-
I cilities for recreation on the earn
| pus this year, particularly the golf
j course and the new swimmin
1 pools for men, may attract both
! regular Stanford students and the ><■
from other institutions this sum
I mer.
In features outside the regular
j class instruction, the most notable,
j point this summer will be tie
large number of lectures by scliol
| ars of renown in a variety of field
1 Some of these lectures will be
j given in the usual Tuesday evening
1 programs and others on afternoon:
Including musical programs, then
1 are at least three or four of thes •
j eaeii week in English for general
j students, beside series in French,
I German, and Spanish.
