# WORTH A THOUGHT OR TWO

11 you have to make a lot of money during the summer in order!
in meet the request of the University as to whom you are to make j
checks payable il you're going to he here in < )ctober, then you can't '
consider being a student during the summer quarter, probably.
11 you have to go to the beach or to the mountains during the j
ummer in order to recuperate from hard work this quarter by
getting a tan, hard muscles, and a bright, clear eye for more of that
much-talked-of h;fl - d work next ( Jctober, then vou can't possiblv coll
ider being a summer quarter student.
I'lit otherwise the idea is worth turning over in the mind once
or twice.
Strange as it may seem to those who have never tried it, regular j
Stanford students who have come back to the campus for a summer ,
quarter are, when interviewed, surprisinglv enthusiastic. They arc!
for it.
Some ot the very things that make other quarters attractive, ren
der the summer quarter attractive in its own way by their absence. I
I here are no intercollegiate activities and the ordinarv student ac
tivities are at a minimum.
In their place are activities of the summer quarter student bodv !
that are mildly interesting, but the real point is that there seems to'
be more time for things that get squeezed out in other quarters.
Included among these things are studies. Summer quarter stit- j
dents testify that they enjoy their courses more than they do in
other terms. If you believe them, that might prove an interesting!
experiment—to see il pleasure may be actually in study.
I'm quite seriously there is a point there. It is easier to carry on j
regular, concentrated work when there are fewer distractions. And i
the credits count toward graduation ; they bring graduation one whole J
quarter nearer. The University now offers an opportunity for a full
and satisfactory course in the summer quarter in most departments. !
Also during the summer it is possible to take work with leaders ,
in education from institutions in all parts of the world, who are not,
available at other times here.
The well-known California climate does very well for itself on
the campus in the summer, and it is not hard work to study here in |
July and August, as it is in some places we might mention where)
one of the chief industries of the weather is providing newspapers
wiili stories of heat prostrations.
< )ther things being equal, there is a good deal to be said in favor
of putting in the summer enjoyably, interspersing study with a swim
in the pool, a round of the golf course, an informal dance, and even i
a lecture now and then worth hearing, even if it is not required
and at the end you are one whole quarter to the good.
