"THE CRUSADES: IRON MEN
AND SAINTS," by Harold
Lamb. Doubleday, Doran and
Co. New York. 1930.
Wlieu tlii' judges nf the Hook of
the .Mouth t'lub, with a unanimous
vote, selected "The C rusades" by Har
old Lamb as the best book of the
month they felt amply justified in
their choice.
The crusades furnish material al
most untouched in modern literature
for stirrhjg honks of the "stranger
than fiction" type. Harold Lamb has
chosen for his subject the first of the
six great crusades and deals with it
from an historical point of view. Mis
material is drawn from the chronicles
of men who marched with the cru
saders and men who saw them pass.
"Upon these original chronicles the
book is based. It does not deal with
the legends that grew up after the
crusades. It is not history rewritten."
The imagination is kindled by the
vividly strange tale as page after page
is turned. I lere is a story more in
credible than the most impossible
scenario, but it is history, unvarnished
and plainly stated. A war that lasted
more than three centuries and in
which two million human beings lost
their lives! The book deals in the
main, as its title suggests, "with a
dozen men, most of them leaders, who
started out on the journey—what tliev
saw on the road, and what they did,
and what befell them*' in Jerusalem.
We see Urban, the exiled Pope, and
the instigator of the vast movement.
We listen to the actual words of his
speech at Clermoijt before an assem
bly of pilgrims and -clergy from all
points of F.urope. We see the mob
frenzied and inspired, surging forward
to receive his blessing and hear the crv
that swelled from thousands of
throats, "God wills it!"
We catch the enthusiasm that swept
through the < hristian world; we sec
the vast army swelling and growing
and pushing on into the Fast. We fol
low the ragged hordes of Peter the
Hermit and our eyes are dazzled by
the ranks of Raymond of Toulouse,
Count Stephen and the young Tan
cred. We watch.the skirmishes, the
plunder, and the rape, now of the fol
lowers of the Cross, now of their
enemies. We see them fall by the
thousands audi" others press in to take
their places. On to Jerusalem!
F'or us the story of the crusades,

| dim and unreal formerly, has become
' vivid and vital and intense. In these
! pages are facts baldly stated and plain
-Ily narrated. There is no attempt at
diverting legends. The readers of
tliis type of book demand clarity (if
1 style and fact, and Mr. Lamb it
to them. We look forward with keen
anticipation to the second volume of
i the series and a continuation of the
most dramatic movement in all of
1 history.

SCOOP. By James S. Hart and
Garrett D. Byrnes. Little,
Brown & Company. Boston.
1930.
"The Front Page" was followed by
"Gentlemen of the Press." Now, on
'the heels of "Gentlemen of the Press,"
; comes "Scoop" by two newspaper men,
James S. J lart and Garrett I). Byrnes.
How far is this thing going, anyway?
The private lite of a newspaperman is
Ino more. The girl reporter has suf
' fered almost as much. The sob sister's
technique was unreservedly exposed in
"Chicago." Hut the journalists must
not mind; they seem to be the ones
who carry on with the expose.
"Scoop" is a bigger and better epi
sode in this expose. It is not so ex
clusively concerned with the routine
•of a newspaper office as to bore the
j uninitiated reader. Yet i-> contains
enough details of that routine to give
it an authoritative air. And the de
tails are Sccttrate.
As in its predecessors, there is
plenty of picturesque profanity in
"Scoop." The usual journalistic gin
iis also present. However, in deference
Ito reality, it is outside the city room
' rather than naked and unashamed in
the top desk drawers.
Melodrama, brazen and without
apology, is "Scoop." Yet this is the
melodrama of a profession which sees
only the exciting events which arc
worth) of printer's ink. It is not
forced and it never lacks plausibility.
The traditional happy ending to
melodrama is omitted. I lowever, be
ing touched by the cynicism and so
phistication of the characters, trie
reader wonders idly if the outcome of
sudden death to the woman in the case
is not more comfortable than would
, be the doubt fid bliss of marriage to
the temperamental newspaperman hero.
At least it is less usual.

SCOOP. By James S. Hart and
Garrett D. Byrnes. Little,
Brown & Company. Boston.
1930.
"The Front Page" was followed by
"Gentlemen of the Press." Now, on
'the heels of "Gentlemen of the Press,"
; comes "Scoop" by two newspaper men,
James S. J lart and Garrett I). Byrnes.
How far is this thing going, anyway?
The private lite of a newspaperman is
Ino more. The girl reporter has suf
' fered almost as much. The sob sister's
technique was unreservedly exposed in
"Chicago." Hut the journalists must
not mind; they seem to be the ones
who carry on with the expose.
"Scoop" is a bigger and better epi
sode in this expose. It is not so ex
clusively concerned with the routine
•of a newspaper office as to bore the
j uninitiated reader. Yet i-> contains
enough details of that routine to give
it an authoritative air. And the de
tails are Sccttrate.
As in its predecessors, there is
plenty of picturesque profanity in
"Scoop." The usual journalistic gin
iis also present. However, in deference
Ito reality, it is outside the city room
' rather than naked and unashamed in
the top desk drawers.
Melodrama, brazen and without
apology, is "Scoop." Yet this is the
melodrama of a profession which sees
only the exciting events which arc
worth) of printer's ink. It is not
forced and it never lacks plausibility.
The traditional happy ending to
melodrama is omitted. I lowever, be
ing touched by the cynicism and so
phistication of the characters, trie
reader wonders idly if the outcome of
sudden death to the woman in the case
is not more comfortable than would
, be the doubt fid bliss of marriage to
the temperamental newspaperman hero.

"THE CRUSADES: IRON MEN
AND SAINTS," by Harold
Lamb. Doubleday, Doran and
Co. New York. 1930.
Wlieu tlii' judges nf the Hook of
the .Mouth t'lub, with a unanimous
vote, selected "The C rusades" by Har
old Lamb as the best book of the
month they felt amply justified in
their choice.
The crusades furnish material al
most untouched in modern literature
for stirrhjg honks of the "stranger
than fiction" type. Harold Lamb has
chosen for his subject the first of the
six great crusades and deals with it
from an historical point of view. Mis
material is drawn from the chronicles
of men who marched with the cru
saders and men who saw them pass.
"Upon these original chronicles the
book is based. It does not deal with
the legends that grew up after the
crusades. It is not history rewritten."
The imagination is kindled by the
vividly strange tale as page after page
is turned. I lere is a story more in
credible than the most impossible
scenario, but it is history, unvarnished
and plainly stated. A war that lasted
more than three centuries and in
which two million human beings lost
their lives! The book deals in the
main, as its title suggests, "with a
dozen men, most of them leaders, who
started out on the journey—what tliev
saw on the road, and what they did,
and what befell them*' in Jerusalem.
We see Urban, the exiled Pope, and
the instigator of the vast movement.
We listen to the actual words of his
speech at Clermoijt before an assem
bly of pilgrims and -clergy from all
points of F.urope. We see the mob
frenzied and inspired, surging forward
to receive his blessing and hear the crv
that swelled from thousands of
throats, "God wills it!"
We catch the enthusiasm that swept
through the < hristian world; we sec
the vast army swelling and growing
and pushing on into the Fast. We fol
low the ragged hordes of Peter the
Hermit and our eyes are dazzled by
the ranks of Raymond of Toulouse,
Count Stephen and the young Tan
cred. We watch.the skirmishes, the
plunder, and the rape, now of the fol
lowers of the Cross, now of their
enemies. We see them fall by the
thousands audi" others press in to take
their places. On to Jerusalem!
F'or us the story of the crusades,

| dim and unreal formerly, has become
' vivid and vital and intense. In these
! pages are facts baldly stated and plain
-Ily narrated. There is no attempt at
diverting legends. The readers of
tliis type of book demand clarity (if
1 style and fact, and Mr. Lamb it
to them. We look forward with keen
anticipation to the second volume of
i the series and a continuation of the
most dramatic movement in all of

crusades. It is not history rewritten."
The imagination is kindled by the
vividly strange tale as page after page
is turned. I lere is a story more in
credible than the most impossible
scenario, but it is history, unvarnished
and plainly stated. A war that lasted
more than three centuries and in
which two million human beings lost
their lives! The book deals in the
main, as its title suggests, "with a
dozen men, most of them leaders, who
started out on the journey—what tliev
saw on the road, and what they did,
and what befell them*' in Jerusalem.
We see Urban, the exiled Pope, and
the instigator of the vast movement.
We listen to the actual words of his
speech at Clermoijt before an assem
bly of pilgrims and -clergy from all
points of F.urope. We see the mob
frenzied and inspired, surging forward
to receive his blessing and hear the crv
that swelled from thousands of
throats, "God wills it!"
We catch the enthusiasm that swept
through the < hristian world; we sec
the vast army swelling and growing
and pushing on into the Fast. We fol
low the ragged hordes of Peter the
Hermit and our eyes are dazzled by
the ranks of Raymond of Toulouse,
Count Stephen and the young Tan
cred. We watch.the skirmishes, the
plunder, and the rape, now of the fol
lowers of the Cross, now of their
enemies. We see them fall by the
thousands audi" others press in to take
their places. On to Jerusalem!
F'or us the story of the crusades,

| dim and unreal formerly, has become
' vivid and vital and intense. In these
! pages are facts baldly stated and plain
-Ily narrated. There is no attempt at
diverting legends. The readers of
tliis type of book demand clarity (if
1 style and fact, and Mr. Lamb it
to them. We look forward with keen
anticipation to the second volume of
i the series and a continuation of the
most dramatic movement in all of
1 history.

SCOOP. By James S. Hart and
Garrett D. Byrnes. Little,
Brown & Company. Boston.
1930.
"The Front Page" was followed by
"Gentlemen of the Press." Now, on
'the heels of "Gentlemen of the Press,"
; comes "Scoop" by two newspaper men,
James S. J lart and Garrett I). Byrnes.
How far is this thing going, anyway?
The private lite of a newspaperman is
Ino more. The girl reporter has suf
' fered almost as much. The sob sister's
technique was unreservedly exposed in
"Chicago." Hut the journalists must
not mind; they seem to be the ones
who carry on with the expose.
"Scoop" is a bigger and better epi
sode in this expose. It is not so ex
clusively concerned with the routine
•of a newspaper office as to bore the
j uninitiated reader. Yet i-> contains
enough details of that routine to give
it an authoritative air. And the de
tails are Sccttrate.
As in its predecessors, there is
plenty of picturesque profanity in
"Scoop." The usual journalistic gin
iis also present. However, in deference
Ito reality, it is outside the city room
' rather than naked and unashamed in
the top desk drawers.
Melodrama, brazen and without
apology, is "Scoop." Yet this is the
melodrama of a profession which sees
only the exciting events which arc
worth) of printer's ink. It is not
forced and it never lacks plausibility.
The traditional happy ending to
melodrama is omitted. I lowever, be
ing touched by the cynicism and so
phistication of the characters, trie
reader wonders idly if the outcome of
sudden death to the woman in the case
is not more comfortable than would
, be the doubt fid bliss of marriage to
the temperamental newspaperman hero.
At least it is less usual.
