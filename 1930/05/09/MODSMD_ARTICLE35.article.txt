# PLENTY OF STANFORD TALENT IN NEW SHOW OPENING SOON IN SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### WILLIAM H. GRACE 
t After, a winter of' prolonged study,
clever devising, and infinite work, ein
| bodying the art and skill of some of
j the best-known theatre winds in tin
country, a new show, "Hi There," is
being born in San Francisco.
Conceived by two successful Broad
| way producers, cradled on ball a doz
i en San Francisco stages, godfathered
j partly by Stanford alumni, and nursed
by considerable" Stanford talent in the
least, "Mi There" will open at Frlang
■ er's Columbia theatre next Wednesday
| night—the first \'ew York musical
! show ever produced, staged and given
jits premiere in the city of the Golden
I (iate.
Sets by Helvenston
I Harold Helvenston, acting director
! of dramatics, has been given free rein
j to employ his talents in creating un
j usual scenes and backgrounds for a
| wide variety of acts and skits, rang
ing from a mock wedding to a piano
i duet. No expense is being spared to
j make the show a success.
Paul • Bissenger, dramatic manager
1 at Stanford not a lustrum ago, is in
charge of this fast-growing child of
| the stage, and he has gathered around
him a show that is tilled with the
I glamour of Broadway, but also
j brightened by a considerable touch of
the Stanford Red. Look at the cast:
Besides Helvenston and Bissenger.
Paul Speeglc, Neal Spaulding, and
I Griff Williams are included with
Odette My nil, Ken Murray, Teddy
Walters, Lester \ ail, '11. Helen
i Charleston, Jerry Whyte, Billy Grif
-1 fith—all celebrated on New York's
j great white way. Mso, some of the
j songs ol "Hi There" have been writ
j ten by Jack WigKcu and < Jriff Wil
liams.
Leftwich Directs
Director of the whole show, and
! probably the most famous person con-
I nected with it, is Alexander Left
i wich, who, with Bissenger, pot on

I "The Tittle Show" which was a suc-
I cess on Broadway last year. Left
wich hn*s directed "Strike Up the
Band," "The Connecticut Yankee,"
and a dozen other New York hits in
! the past.
"A very intimate review" it is call
ed, smart and spicy. By next week it
will appear as a rapid barrage of
musical and comic skits, block outs,
dances, and chorus numbers. ()ver a
hundred acts have been tried and
worked over, and about 35 of the best
will be staged. San Francisco critics,
who have seen some of the numbers
being developed in empty theatres and
unusued halls all over the city, are en
thusiastic over the chorus in particu
lar.
An unusual and interesting thing
about the choruses is that there are
no men in them. This idea follows a
new trend in theatrical production
which advocates the freshness and
grace of feminine l>eauty appearing
alone, without a masculine back
ground. There are but 12 girls in the
chorus, as per the "intimate" idea of
the whole review.
"Hi There" will go to Los Angeles
1 following its run in San Francisco.

An unusual and interesting thing
about the choruses is that there are

I (iate.
Sets by Helvenston
I Harold Helvenston, acting director
! of dramatics, has been given free rein
j to employ his talents in creating un
j usual scenes and backgrounds for a
| wide variety of acts and skits, rang
ing from a mock wedding to a piano
i duet. No expense is being spared to
j make the show a success.
Paul • Bissenger, dramatic manager
1 at Stanford not a lustrum ago, is in
charge of this fast-growing child of
| the stage, and he has gathered around
him a show that is tilled with the
I glamour of Broadway, but also
j brightened by a considerable touch of
the Stanford Red. Look at the cast:
Besides Helvenston and Bissenger.
Paul Speeglc, Neal Spaulding, and
I Griff Williams are included with
Odette My nil, Ken Murray, Teddy
Walters, Lester \ ail, '11. Helen
i Charleston, Jerry Whyte, Billy Grif
-1 fith—all celebrated on New York's
j great white way. Mso, some of the
j songs ol "Hi There" have been writ
j ten by Jack WigKcu and < Jriff Wil
liams.
Leftwich Directs
Director of the whole show, and
! probably the most famous person con-
I nected with it, is Alexander Left
i wich, who, with Bissenger, pot on

I "The Tittle Show" which was a suc-
I cess on Broadway last year. Left
wich hn*s directed "Strike Up the
Band," "The Connecticut Yankee,"
and a dozen other New York hits in
! the past.
"A very intimate review" it is call
ed, smart and spicy. By next week it
will appear as a rapid barrage of
musical and comic skits, block outs,
dances, and chorus numbers. ()ver a
hundred acts have been tried and
worked over, and about 35 of the best
will be staged. San Francisco critics,
who have seen some of the numbers
being developed in empty theatres and
unusued halls all over the city, are en
thusiastic over the chorus in particu
lar.
