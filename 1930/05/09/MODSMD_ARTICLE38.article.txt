# PLANS REVEALED TO RUN AUTO ON COMMON FUEL OIL
## Diesel Engine Installed In Automobile Gives Cheap Operation 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. <s. (/p)â€”Plans
j for a nix-cylinder automobile burn
ing cheap oil were revealed today
by C. L. Cummins, Columbus, Ind.,
following a 792-mile trip in a Diesel
| powered ear at a fuel cost of $1.38. '
The engine will be constructed
j for use in the Indianapolis Day race
for a demonstration of the reliabil- j
; ity and economy of oil burning
| cars.
"We do not expect to win the
i race," Cummins said, "but by ear
rying a fuel supply that will last,
i for the entire grind we hope to
j eliminate pit stops and to maintain
, a speed of 80 to 85 miles an hour."
Decision to build the engine came
after the successful trip from In- i
dianapolis to the National Automo
bile Show here, a trip viewed by
the inventor as "a laboratory ex
periment to see if the engine could
stand a cross country trip."
The engine mounted in the auto
mobile is a standard marine type
Diesel, a four-cylinder model with
no refinements for passenger ear !
j uses except perfection of a throt
tling device which allowed the
driver to control the engine like
an ordinary gasoline motor.
Cummins' engine, ttie result of
12 years of work in the field, differs
from ordinary Diesel engines in
that the fuel is gasified before be
ing injected into the cylinders. The
oil, from which gasoline has been
extracted by distillation, is used.
The injector of {lie Cummins is a !
' miniature still which "cracks" the!
oil under pressure and extracts |
what gasoline remains.
Each charge to the cylinders is |
one-third the size of a grain of j
rice. Injected into the cylinders, j
the gasoline is ignited and furnish
es enough heat to burn up there- 1
maining oil that does not "crack."
