# Varsity Nine Rallies In Eighth To Down Kansai, 4-2
## TEAMS BATTLE ON EVEN TERMS TILL LAST TWO INNINGS Leverenz Wins Fourth in Row; Honda Stars For Losers 
### 
'Battling on oven terms through
nut most of the game, Stanford's
baseball varsity finally shoved
over two markers in the last of
the eighth inning to defeat the
Kansai University nine, 4-2, here
yesterday. The Japanese team left
immediately after the game to con
tinue their tour throughout the
Southland before returning to the
Orient.
Lefty Leverenz hung up his
fourth victory of the season to con
tinue a 1.000 percentage and struck
out four men, issuing only one free
ticket in the meanwhile. Honda, a
port-sider, held the Cards down to
two runs up to the sixth canto,
when Kojima went in for the Nip
pons.
Tin; diminutive men from Osaka
drew first blood, scoring one tally
in the second frame when Dejima
went to second on Levewenz's bad
throw to Mearfs, took third on
Johnson's muff of Hardy's peg, and
scored on Konisha's perfect squeeze
play hunt that had the whole Stan
ford infield guessing.
The Kedshirts retaliated in the
third inning, Leverenz drawing a
walk, taking second on Miki's er
ror, and scoring on Mears' Texas
Ledguer.
In the fifth, the Kansai nine
went into an uproar over Umpire
Harry Kenton's decision of balls
and strikes. The team's manager
kept a close tab on every ball
pitched and, according to his count,
as well as to Base Umpire Sykes
and the assembled multitude, Toy
oda was entitled to a walk. Renton
held the small shortstop to Ihe
plate, however, and the Japanese
player Hied out to end a nicely
started rally.
The Nipponese came right back
in the sixtli to get that run, Oda
reaching lirst on Mears' error, and
traveling around on Kojima's safe
hingle and Mears' muff of Johnson's
high throw.
Stanford evened up things in
their half of the sixth, Mears sing
ling through short and coming in
on Kintala's hit and Wright's sacri
fice. The two winning counters
were made in the eighth when
Hunken drew life on Toyoda's er
ror, Wright walked, and Kelly hit
a fluke double to score both men.
The game was witnessed by a
large number of Japanese fans and
the stands drew a great deal of
amusement from the remarks of
the Japanese tossers and their ex
cited and fast way of playing.
Harry "Blue"' Berg was the out
standing man on the field, playing
in a new position at second base.
Rintala and Mears butli collected a
pair of safeties, while Captain
Konisha got two out of three.
