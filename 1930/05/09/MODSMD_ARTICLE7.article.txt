I vices for solving crime was claimed
jtoday in the anouncemcnt that the "lie
I detector" developed at the University
| of Chicago had solved the murder of

I dcr him one of the best policed cities
in the United States.
\\ bile Kceler was at school at Stan
ford, he paid his expenses by conduct

istered to prevent death from the bite
of a rattlesnake.
