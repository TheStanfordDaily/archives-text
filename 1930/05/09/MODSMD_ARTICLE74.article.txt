# ANNUAL PRESS-DAILY BASEBALL FEUD TO BE STAGED ON VARSITY FIELD MAY 18
## 
### H. M 
(hue a year relations between the
Stanford (.Diversity I'ress anil the
Stanford Daily are strained almost to
the bursting point, and the two organi
zations run over to the baseball Hold
and light it out. Then they conic back
and settle down to another four quar
ters of serving the public with the
campus news.
This year the pen pushers and the
press men are slated to stage their an
nual blowout in the varsity ball or
chard at 10 o'clock Sunday morning,
May 18. Although the Press intends
to have only bona fide members of the
organization in the lineup, it is ru
mored that the Daily is going to play
a goodly number of ringers.
The typesetters have been holding
daily practice sessions to get into
shape for the coming tussle, but the

I Daily has only been pounding the tvpc-
I writers instead of the horsehide.
I Boasting of several one- and two-year
letternien, the journalists believe they
! have an unusually strong outfit which
| will easily capture the gameâ€”in spite
of the long string of past defeats.
Gould, Wiuquist, and McGarr are
j sure to be in Daily uniforms and arc
all capable players. Others that may
1 see action are Humphreys, Whitelcy,
Terwilliger, Kullman, Ricklcfs, Grace,
Crawford, Goodwin, and Skipwith.
The press gang, under the manager
ship of Carl Schmidt, will be chosen
from the following men: Warren,
Mayrhofer, Uriell, Hamlet, G. Whit
ten, Wilhehny, Tuner, C. Whitten,
j lJartholdy, Cross, Bartiiicss, Eurbush,
i Schmidt, and Till 1. Mayrhofer, a
j former star of a Canadian team, will
I probably face the Daily batsmen.
