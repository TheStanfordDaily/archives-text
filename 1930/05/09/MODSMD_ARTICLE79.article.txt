# NET STARS ENTER TEAMS IN MIXED DOUBLES TOURNEY
## Play lo Start Next Week; Last Year's Winners Are Re-Entered 
### 
Hard-fought competition looms for
the annual spring quarter university
mixed doubles tennis tourney to begin
next week if names seen among the
entry list are any indication. Perhaps
the most feared pair among them is
the Larry Hall-Sue Betty Dunlap duo,
winners of the 1928 plaj. However,
Hall, varsity tennis captain, will be up
against some of his varsity team
mates in such stellar talent as Wces
ner, Plymire, and Gledhill. Some of
the less-fatuous entries are also ex
pected to furnish upsets with a show
of superior teamwork.
Flwvti Buggc, in charge of the play,
lias announced that drawings will be
made during the week-end and an
nounced Monday, regardless of wheth
er or not 10 teams have signed by to
night. Twelve combinations have en
tered to date, and a number of men
have signed without partners. Bugge
wishes that all women desiring to play
get in touch with Marian Lcachman,
and an attempt will be made to se
cure a partner for them.
Though prizes have not been settled
upon, it is probable that each of the
winners in the victorious pair will be
awarded new tennis racquets.
