## 
### 
Hoping to add more laurels to
their already heavily-laden brows,
Harlow Hot hurt, premier Cardinal
shotpulter, and Les llables, leading
Stanford track ineligible, left the
campus last night for Los Angeles.
The Uedshiit tracksters will com
pete in the Southern Pacific Asso
ciation of the A.A.I', tryouts being
held at Occidental College, Eagle
Rock, tomorrow afternoon.
This meet brings together for
the fifth time this season ltothert
and Herman Brix, L.A.A.C. weight
man who is a claimant for the
world's shot put record, having
heaved the iron ball 52 feet 4V-:
inches in a tilt with Dean Crom
well's Trojans, ltothert has so far
proven a jinx for Brix, having de
feated Hie brawny Southerner each
time they have met.
llables is expected to provide
Los Angeles track fans opportunity
of watching two close battles when
he competes against Frank Wykoff,
speedy Southern California sprint
er, in the 100- and 220-yard dashes.
Wykoff holds one decision over the
Cardinal ineligible whom he de
feated in a SMJ century at the
Fresno Relays. The Stanford dash
man, however, litis turned in the
fastest time of this season, winning
the 100-yard event at Kezar Sta
dium last week in 1t.5 seconds.
