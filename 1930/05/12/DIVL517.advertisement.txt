| is to find your pipe
and tobacco
YOU will discover the full pleasure
of pipe-smoking when you hit on
j the tobacco that really suits you in the
j pipe that really fits you. Then you can
| light up and lean back and cross your
j feet on the mantel or wherever, and
j purr and smoke—how you can smoke!
The trick is to find your pipe and
' your tobacco. Nobody can find them
J for you, and until you find them you
I must go on groping in outer darkness
—but have you tried Edgeworth?
Edgeworth may be just the tobacco
j you're looking for. It has a certain
i distinctive flavor that men like; it is
i slow-burning, cool—it will not bite
i your tongue; and it is rich with the
I savor, fragrant with the aroma, of fine
; old burley blended exactly right-
Check us up—try Edgeworth in a
j good pipe. We'll send you some help
i ful hints on pipes, and we'll even send
j you some Edgeworth, [a generous free
j packet of it to try, for nothing but
i the coupon. That's meeting you more
I than halfway, isn't it? We know our
| Edgeworth!
Edgeworth is o careful
' li 'i I blend of good tobaccos
1 C\\Gu"o|Mty —selected especially for
1 ' pipe-smoking. Its quality I

Buy Edgeworth any
where in two forms —
"Ready-Rubbed" and
"Plug Slice"—lsr pock- !
