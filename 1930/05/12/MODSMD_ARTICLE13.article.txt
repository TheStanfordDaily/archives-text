# NATIONAL GUARD SUSTAIN STRICT MILITARY ORDER AFTER TEXAS MOBS RIOT
## Adjoining Roads Crowded With Oklahoma Inhabitants; Coroner's Jury Gives Decision on Negro Death; Colonel McGee Orders Investigation 
### 
OHERMAN, Texas, May 11. (/P) —Patrolling the streets under a hot
sun and manning machine guns placed at strategic points, Texas
National Guardsmen maintained strict order under martial law here
today. The highways leading into Sherman and the streets of this
pretty little city were thick with Sunday motorists, who found a new
attraction in the burned Grayson county courthouse and the negro
residence district stormed last Friday and Friday night by a mob
incensed over the criminal attack upon a white woman by George
Hughes, 41, negro.
A military order prohibiting the congregating of more than three
persons tended to cramp the style of today's sightseers. The order was

!>OBO of the first issued by the com
i mandant. Colonel Lawrence E. Mc-
Gee of Dallas.
Hughes was declared officially by
acoroner's jury to have been suf
focated in a vault in the court
house', into which he was thrust
jl'When Texas Rangers and other
officers trying to save him from
the mob were driven from the
structure by the flames consum
ing it.
The decision meant the Coroner's
[jury believed Hughes was dead
when entrance into the thick-walled
j vault was forced by the mob using
acetylene torches and dynamite.
His body, nevertheless, was drag
ged through the streets and then
burned at a prominent corner in
I the negro district.
McGee named Colonel L. S. Da
vidson and Majors E. /. Crowdus
and John Naylor to constitute a
court of inquiry with supreme au
thority to investigate and to direct
I arrests. The court probably would
: start work tomorrow, it was stated.
All business places except hotels,
restaurants, and drug stores were
ordered to close at 6 p.m.
Martial law was clamped down
last night under a proclamation by
Governor Dan Moody well after the
, rioting had ceased but in the face
of widely reported rumors that a
new onslaught on the jail was
planned in an effort to liberate
thirteen mob members held there.
I Scouting parties were sent out to
day to size u]) the situation. They
reported an unusual number of
Oklahoma automobiles in Denison,
the sister city, a few miles north
and about twenty-five miles from
the Oklahoma-Texas State line, but
no indications of a renewed atack.

pretty little city were thick with Sunday motorists, who found a new
attraction in the burned Grayson county courthouse and the negro
residence district stormed last Friday and Friday night by a mob
incensed over the criminal attack upon a white woman by George
Hughes, 41, negro.
A military order prohibiting the congregating of more than three
persons tended to cramp the style of today's sightseers. The order was

!>OBO of the first issued by the com
i mandant. Colonel Lawrence E. Mc-
Gee of Dallas.
Hughes was declared officially by
acoroner's jury to have been suf
focated in a vault in the court
house', into which he was thrust
jl'When Texas Rangers and other
officers trying to save him from
the mob were driven from the
structure by the flames consum
ing it.
The decision meant the Coroner's
[jury believed Hughes was dead
when entrance into the thick-walled
j vault was forced by the mob using
acetylene torches and dynamite.
His body, nevertheless, was drag
ged through the streets and then
burned at a prominent corner in
I the negro district.
McGee named Colonel L. S. Da
vidson and Majors E. /. Crowdus
and John Naylor to constitute a
court of inquiry with supreme au
thority to investigate and to direct
I arrests. The court probably would
: start work tomorrow, it was stated.
All business places except hotels,
restaurants, and drug stores were
ordered to close at 6 p.m.
Martial law was clamped down
last night under a proclamation by
Governor Dan Moody well after the
, rioting had ceased but in the face
of widely reported rumors that a
new onslaught on the jail was
planned in an effort to liberate
thirteen mob members held there.
I Scouting parties were sent out to
day to size u]) the situation. They
reported an unusual number of
Oklahoma automobiles in Denison,
the sister city, a few miles north
and about twenty-five miles from
the Oklahoma-Texas State line, but
no indications of a renewed atack.
