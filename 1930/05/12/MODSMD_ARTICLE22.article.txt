## 
### BY DREW PALLETTE 
"The people of India and of the
Malay Stales are not, at present,
capable of self government," It. 11.
Silverthoruo, ex-missionary, ex
ploiter, globe-trotter, Stanford stu
dent, and minister, stated yester
day in a. personal interview with
the Daily. "However, they should
be independent, as every State and
people should be. and I believe
thai such a condition will eventu
ally come in thi! Orient."
Silver!borne, who has spenl over
five years as a missionary and
rubber planter near Singapore, and
who has spent much of his time
traveling and studying conditions
throughout India and the Orient,
expressed a great esteem for
Mahattua Gandhi, leader of flu- in
surgent movement. "Gandhi is a
great soul," he remarked. "He is a
man far in advanced of his times,
lb* and his followers, however, fall
down in not providing for a defi
nite form of government in their
program." The minister believes

that, the Hindu's plan of passive
resistance is far in advance of
force.
"The British officials sent to the
Orient are of the highest type. As
far as the Federated Malay States,
which are under British control, arc
concerned, the British have been
very fair and have acted in an hon
orable manner. Perhaps if we had
sent men in the past of the caliber
that the majority of these are,
existing conditions would not have
a risen.
"The brown people that I have
come in contact with are very
happy under existing conditions,"
Silvert borne stated. "Any Occi
dental with any decency at all will
have no trouble with the natives.
"Of course," the speaker con*
(luded, "India should have her lib
erty. However, under existing con
ditions of conflict and ignorance
such a situation would not be to
her benefit. 1 feel sure that Indian
freedom will not be obtained for
some years to come."
