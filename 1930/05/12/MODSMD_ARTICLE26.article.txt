# AFTER ONE YEAR
## 
### 
About 111 in time of year, when the fresltniau is planning fur his
now home on the Kow, in tlu* Mali, or in I'alo Alto for next fall,
lie may find himself looking hack over the three <|uarters he has
spent at Encina.
A year at Encina does an untold lot to and for ihe freshman.
\rriving for the first time, he i> more than likely dissatisfied with
his room, and finds a tradition concerning the poor food. At the
end of the year, in nine out of ten cases, the frosh considers it as
an experience to he traded on no consideration. As a matter of
fact, lie probably would realize the futility of attempting to trade
l:is hoard anyplace on the campus.
Far more than his attitude toward his surroundings, however,
are the freshman's ideas in general altered. Ile finds himself within
;â€¢ circle of friends from widely separated sections of the country,
and he broadens accordingly.
Perhaps once a week, perhaps oftcner, the first-year man par
ticipates in a hullsession. From amongst the profanity, for which
Kncina bullsessions are noted, new ideas emerge and find root in
his brain. The experiences, past and present, of his friends are
added to his own. if lie is "experienced." or arouse in him the
desire to pursue the somewhat forbidden pleasures which constitute
"experience."
Religion comes in for a particular beating in the Encina bull
session. With biology and citizenship facts for talking points, the
spiritual realm is discussed, when the subject of women is tem
porarily exhausted. The devout freshman becomes slightly skeptical,
the skeptical freshman becomes more so. and the scoffer becomes
impressed, in spite of himself, with the sincerity of his devout
friend.
In the Encina mixing-pot, the freshman who has been subject
to the strictest supervision at home undergoes the greatest trans
formation. It is he who goes to excesses. It is he who plays in
his first poker game during the first week in the hall at penny ante,
and is sitting in at games beyond his limits by spring.
The Encina year, although it has a demoralizing effect on many,
does not necessarily ruin anyone. To the group as a whole it is
beneficial. Each succeeding class is offered the same experience,
and each one becomes more of a unit within the University for that
reason, llis first year makes the freshman not primarily a Row
man. or a I Tall man. but a Stanford man.
