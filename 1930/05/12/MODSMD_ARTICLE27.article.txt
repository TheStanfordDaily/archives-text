						FROSH LOOKS AT WOMEN
## 
### 
.Warly every new student who conies to Stanford has been j
forewarned that the Five I lundred is by no means the cream of the 1
California crop. Such gentle warning is invariably given by a,
friend who should know, so the freshman arrives with his opinion
already formed on the subject.
The "new guy looks around him on the Ouad for the first
time on registration day. Now beauty, strangely enough, is judged j
almost as much by quantity as quality. Ihe average man in a
strange place determines whether the women are on the whole,
good or poor by the number of good-looking women he sees. At
Stanford, in comparison to most other universities, the number 0!
stunning women is necessarily smaller tor purely mathematical;
reasons, if none other. Then it may be partially true that the;
"beautiful but dumb" saying is conversely true.
\i any rate, the frosh sees fewer queens than he would expect;
to find on a large campus. "Joe was right," says he. "W hat the
hell." And he scrawls a letter to the girl at home.
\ month later his opinion is only slightly altered. Xeaily all
of his friends have concurred with him in condemnation of the
fair sex on the harm, and he does not want to be the first to break
the line. expression has probably become by this time On
the whole they're lousy, but that babe whose rat I cut up isn't so
1 ;>d, and the two in my cit sleeper will pass.
Craduallv bis estimation ol Stanford co-eds rises, and the frosh
finds himself speaking quite frankly of bis feminine acquaintances!
as "honeys" and "queens." It is a long but convincing process, this
discovery of the Stanford woman, but at the end of it the freshman
realizes that the Farm co-eds combine good looks, intelligence, and
interesting personalities.
Then the frosh goes on a blind date to a Mills dance, as so
many freshmen do, and gets a new slant on the matter. Perhaps
now be is warv of first impressions, but for some reason they look
better to hint than the home products, lie has a good time, goes
home .and doesn't see the Mills women for two weeks. I'nder
ihese circumstances, and in daily association with the Stanford
co-eds. he finds himself in a sufficiently neutralized position to
analyze the situation.
Mills women, it seems, possess the same recommendations as
do Stanford women. They are of the same high order, which
naturallv falls under the freshman's top heading in his rating of
women, whatever that may be. The Mills girl, too, is intelligent,
good-looking, interesting, and entertaining. I hen there is some
thing more about her.
Perhaps merely distance lends enchantment alter all. wondets
the Stanford frosh. ()r perhaps it's that she is more delighted upon
accepting a date. More likely, she doesn t have that realization ot ,1
situation well in hand, which the Stanford woman inevitably reaches.
