BYSTANDER. By Maxim Gorki, ,
New York: Jonathan Cape &
Harrison Smith, 1930. Trans
lated by Bernard Guilbert Guer
ney.
Great is this book, great and uni
versally true. Herein is contained the j
secret of the creation of the spirit and i
the mind and the character of a hu- .
man In ing.
People are trite and tiresome or
original and interesting. People as
sume masks and "think themselves
up" and one wonders at them or is 1
intrigued by them. Then, too, peo
ple become critics and therefore!
static or philosophers and so insurg- J
cuts, or, occasionally as l.ydia, re
main forever a mystery, though con
quered.
Clim and some people were dc
signed to be aloof -bystanders. I bey
see through life or perhaps only
through the smoke of the fire of
reality. Their lives are not vital but
action itself may be superficial. Clim
Satnghin would feel the power ol ;
words anil see the futility of them.
Maxim Gorki has spent the past
three years of his life on this chef
d'oeuvre. I he story of a Russian boy
luil it might have been of Adam or
the whimsical American girl or
Schopenhauer. Btrt because he is a
Russian and a Slav, Clim discovers
and wonders as we, yet he knows
something more, as though the Gods
had whispered to him at dawn while
we were still asleep. ( lim in words
of worth and beauty whisks us to
other spheres. His gift i-. as the
painter's brush. Our admiration is a
seiiH' of self realization and so most
precious of all. This is a great book

and true, yet beautiful,

SEVEN DAYS LEAVEâ€”At the
Varsity Theatre, Palo Alto.
"Seven Days Leave" iK one of
the best moving pictures w have
had the pleasure of seeing fori
many a day. It is adapted from
Barrie's "Tlie Old Lady Shows Her
Medals" and Hie Barrio touch is
t here.
Tike story is a simple one and
deals Willi simple people. There
are two main characters: a lonely
old woman and a young soldier.
The scene is laid in England ai the
time of the World War. There is
no love interest, as we commonly
speak of it, hut love is there in a
more sincere and deep measure
than one linds it every day.
The plot is typically Barrie
esque. A London charwoman reads
of a young hoy in the Black Watch
regiment whose last, name is the
same as hers, and she pretends he
is her son. When he comes home
lon leave with the intention of de-
I sorting they meeUand, inspired by
her devotion, he goes hack to the
front t<> die a hero's death. The ac
tion never once approaches senti
mentality hit I remains convincing
' tliroughoul.
Gary Cooper portrays the young
hoy "gone wrong" splendidly. His
change from an insolent young sol
dier to a considerate son is gradual
enough to be true to life. But
honors for living her role go to
Beryl Mercer as the old lady.
