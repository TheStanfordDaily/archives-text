## SLEEP OR STARVE 
### 
The Editor, Sir: <
A Freshman's hoard bill for Ihe
| spring quarter is $85.00; there are
72 days in the quarter. This makes
board $1.18 a day or a meal,
a surprisingly low sum. A stranger
might wonder how it is possible.
As a Freshman, 1 know. Mere's
i how.
To begin with, the dining hall
| gives no Saturday meals, despite
i the fact that the fraternities, mt- j
j orities, Roble, and some of the'
j eating clubs do.
Secondly, no more than half the
' holders of meal tickets get up for
I breakfast. The management prob
i ably assigns tlijs to the "sleep ;i
little longer" urge; I ascribe it t<>
I the breakfasts. A Freshman wakes
up hungry, goes to breakfast hun
i gry, and returns to his room hun
| gry. Halt' an orange pins dry or wet
! cereal constitutes an average break- I

. fast. This average is a powerful
factor in the success of the Encina
store. The lure of a soft bed La
to he counteracted by more than
the thought of an appetizer.
A conservative estimate of the
number of meals that a Freshman
pays for and eats away from the
dining hall during rushing is ten.
At the beginning of rushing season
this year the dining room he'-.ns
passed around a sheet of paper,
I upon which we were to put down
'the meals during which we were
to be absent. This procedure gave
a first impression that the authori
ties were considering a refund.
Like many first impressions it was
erroneous. The management sim
ply wanted to know how nauen
food not to oprepare.
Has this revelation shown why
Encina board is so reasonably
priced? And on top of this the fare
lis only fair. â€”W. T.
