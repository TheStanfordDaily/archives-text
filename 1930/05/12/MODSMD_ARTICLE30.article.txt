1. With scientific management,
2. With a large buying power,
3. With a university to rJraw
from,
4. With a purpose lo serve the
students,
The Stanford Union (and with 110
exaggeration) serves
1. The rankest coffee,
2. The most tasteless r.ril ids,
soups, and vegetables, and
3. The poorest pie.

Is it not queer, I ask you—
when, anywhere in Palo Alto,
from an establishment, paying
overhead and with a nurpo.se to
profit,
we can buy a larger meal,
properly cooked,
and better served,
l'or less money
THAT we submit, and continue,
| like fools,
to cat at the Stanford Union?
I —B. B. H.
