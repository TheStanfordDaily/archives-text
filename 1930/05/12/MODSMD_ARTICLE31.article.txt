# PSYCHOLOGY COURSE TO BE GIVEN GRADUATE BUSINESS STUDENTS

(Editor's Note: This is the third of |
a series of articles by a Busi
ness student written to assist!
seniors in choosing a line for
graduate study or business pur- !
suit.)
To some students one of the most j
fascinating courses in Stanford is
Edward K. Strong's course in
Psychology of Advertising. The j
course consists of four parts: 1.
Sales strategies and advertising
psychology; 2. Writing a letter or |
report to a chief executive that will
"stop liirn cold in his tracks" and
get. attention where others are
brushed aside scarcely looked at; j
Study of environment, social and
industrial conditions conducive to I
maximum human efficiency; 4. |
Psychology of handling irate strik- ,
ers, incendiaries, and "trouble 1
makers" tactfully but firmly, or of:
dealing with public criticism diplo
matically, yet without sidestepping
or yielding ground.
It is unfortunate that a course
appealing to a wide variety of stu
dents —in history, economics, social
science, engineering, political sci
ence, and even English—is strictly
limited to graduate students in
Business. Stanford at present has
no undergraduate course in Sales
manship and Advertising. Psycho
logical strategy is a basic sub
stance, the kind of stuff Disraelis
and Lincolns and Bismarcks and
Ben Franklins are made of. States
men are master strategists who can
apply the salesman's strategy and
actics on a projected scale, winning
not only an individual, but a mob,
, army, or nation. In industry a few
men are worth $50,000 a year in
' spite of their slight knowledge of
j the field, because tbev can hold to
j gether men who do and permeate
| the organization with loyalty, co
operation, and enthusiasm, where a

lesser man would have civil war
in a week. Ii is a master talent. It
can, however, be developed to some
extent in all of ns. Salesmen used
to be "bored." Today they are
'"trained," And trained men are
outstripping those relying on per
sonality, cigars, and hunches.
10. 11. L. Gregory, in charge of
the S.F. office of the Aetna Life,
stated to the writer recently that
Dr. Strong was, with possibly one
exception, the greatest teacher of
insurance psychology in America.
Strong started as professor of Psy
chology at Columbia, then Lt.-Col.
of Personnel during the war and
one of several who introduced that
branch into the Army, which since
has been used by industry through-
I out the country. Later he was Pro
! lessor of Carnegie School of Life
(Insurance Salesmanship, and has
produced young salesmen who have
j sold as much as a million a year.
The course requires a good many
evenings of concentrated thought
.till 12 or I o'clock, writings ads,
testing "appeal," framing strategies,
ior formulating hypothetical labor
policies. Hut the student who digs
deep will feel amply repaid a few
i years later in almost any line of
business.
