# FROSH HAZING WAS REALLY TOUGH BACK IN "GOOD OLD DAYS"
## Water Nozzles Jammed In Protesting Throats By Sophomores 
### (By Margaret Friedman 
"And the freshmen are not fresh
men any more."
Alas and alack, times have certain
ly changed. Ask any old (irad. No
longer need fair co-eds peep between
their pretty finger tips at freshmen,
trousers rolled on bigh, hiking
through (Juad at the "'reasonable
demand of a sophomore, nor need they !
gaze abhorrently on the unshaven and
unshorn mighty men of Stanford on
llohoc's Day,(the men queered that
themselves by trimming the pet
mustache of one of the profs.) And in
in those happy days freshmen carried
matches for their superiors, but God
help 'em if they smoked a cigarette
themselves or cast interested (-) eyes |
upon a member of the I'ive Hundred
whilst on Quad. ij
Then those l'rosh-Soph tights.
Buy! they were good. F'rinstance the
I'nster bight in fall, which lasted two
days and incapacitated several dozen
erstwhile hale and hearties. Ihe day |
aftci registration the frosh gathered
and hiked to Searsville where they j
pitched camp, ate, and sent out spies.
The Sophs camped in the hills, and 1
they too sent out spies to see il the!
enclitic's spies were spying—and you
can bet they were. In the morning the ,
Sophs tore around the campus laying ;
posters libeling the new and tender j
yearlings, and the frosh tried plenty
iiard to sto]t them, all of which re
sulted in one grand water fight on
some lawn in the middle of the row.
Tonsil tickling nozzles were jammed ,
down protesting throats and the water
turned on. (iurglc, gurgle, splash,
blub and eleven cases of pneumonia.
Next day they held the Tie-Up, and
in those days nobody got away to j
rejoin the fracas. Paint of a tell-tale
green marked the prisoner frosh in |
uucscapablc blurbs, and woe to him
if lie ventured back on the battle field.
The S. P. C. A. stopped the Irish
Marathon when the twenty-five com
petitors from both the sophomore and
freshman classes gave the pigs and
chickens who were playing with them,
an awful run for life. This pro
tective association somehow couldn't
see how lunges and tackles below
the knee were going to improve the
delegability of the animals, though
they might be counted on to improve
almost any man's football form.
And women, barken to this. Kncina
! used to employ the good ol' lockout
j system too. Picture the freshmen
being put to bed that way now. Ah,
well!
When men were men, and before
1 the death rate got too high they held
baseball fights, mud fights n'every
tliing. And the Mug Ugly gave the
Juniors a taste of the same thing. All
year the Juniors wore handsome plugs
and ever so often they'd give them a
nice coat of lead paint. When the
"so-ottens had occasioned about twen
,tv pounds of nice heavy lead the
Juniors took possession of the Law
Steps on a bright spring day and gave
. the mounting hordes an all-unbidden
glimpse of the starry heavens.
Those were the days! And to what
has Stanford fallen when her present
tradition permits her only to write
Campus Opinions and knock the Ad
ministration, Board of Athletic t on
trol, and the Union.
