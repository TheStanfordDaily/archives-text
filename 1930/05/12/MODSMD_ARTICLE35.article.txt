# How They Gape!

Still we wonder how the choice
Is made by "talkie" makers
Who seek an actor with a voice
And face that suits the takers.
It's a gripe to see a brute
And hear a squeaky prattle
Or view a femme with map that'i
grand
But renders noise of battle.
May some bulk (as yet nnfound)
Turn up a singing soul
Who can make a pleasant sound
Without his face a gaping hole.
