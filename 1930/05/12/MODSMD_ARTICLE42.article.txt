Nearing the end of a long,
drawn-out intramural baseball
season which began over a
month ago, it seems fitting that
this column should devote a
few lines to the annual Farm
classic and try to find out what
has been wrong with it this
year. To back up the assump
tion that it has been an un
satisfactory session for the
mural diamond enthusiasts,
we have figures that speak for
themselves. No less than 54
scheduled tilts were forfeited,
and for 10 of these neither
team put in an appearance.
With four games per day slated
for the intramural diamonds when
the Daily's mural sports scribe
reached the said hall orchards, sel
dom more than one contest would
be in progress, and sometimes the
green pastures would ho complete
ly deserted. Among the victims of
ihis sad state of affairs is the
hustling outfit which represented
the El Tigre eating club, who
turned out for all their games and
won most of them. Had all the tilts
been played in their league they
might still have a chance for the
lille. At leasf they would bo satis
fied that they had lost out in a fair
and square arrangement.
The hard-working El Tigre
nine played and won three con
tests, losing out by a score of
15 to 14 in their final game to
the Japanese Club, who had
won all of their tilts by default
and copped the league cham
pionship by virtue of this one
point victory. This Japanese
aggregation, by the way, did
not enjoy the full glory of their
title, turning out for every
game and finding no team
there against which to test
their strength. Unless they
could meet an improvised team
in a practice game, they had
wasted the time and trouble of
turning out.
The suggested remedy for the
lack of interest in the annual base
ball struggle is that the play be
soft ball instead of the present use
of the regulation pellet. No doubt
tiiis change would enliven the com
petition, since it requires less skill
and living groups play it in back
lots for diversion on sunny after
noons. The intramural moguls op
pose this, however, on the grounds
that regulation ball might uncover
varsity material among the ranks
of the unheralded. Perhaps.
But it seems that ball on
such rough diamonds as the
mural fields can develop noth
ing but pitchers. Infielders have
little chance to show their
wares when what looks like an
easy grounder takes a crazy
hop to make it a safe hit. Swat
kings are not facing a caliber
of chucking which will develop
their batting ability. Vard
Loomis, who went up from the
ranks last year, is an oft-men
tioned example of how talent
may be revealed by hard-ball
competition. He is a hurler,
however.
Next year may see the play in
two divisions: one soft and one
hard-ball league, according to Bill
Ellington, dean of intramural
sports. This seems to be the logical
arrangement, since groups which
possess big-league players may de
velop their prospects, and groups
who have not may enjoy the com
petition. Another proposed change
is that drawings be bracketed as
they are in tennis. This would
shorten the schedule considerably
and would serve to remedy the low
ebb at which we find the interest
near the close of fhe season.
in the way of changes, how
ever, let us suggest that for
the regulation baseball league
there be selected more than
just plots of rough ground for
diamonds.
