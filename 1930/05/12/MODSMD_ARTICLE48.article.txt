# THE 						STANFORD STRONG MAN
## Versatile Harlow Cleans Up Big In Track, Football, Basketball; Beats World Shot Record 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Two years ago, before Ralph
Rose's long-standing world's record
in the slioipul of 51 feet had been
broken by Kuck, llirschfeld, and
Brix. a young man by the name of
Harlow Rothert was tossing the
18-pound brass ball out at Stanford
University and hoping some day
to surpass Rose's mark. He came
Fast to the J.C.4-A. meet at Cam
bridge and made the second 50-
foot put in the hisißry of the games
a few minutes after his teammate,
Eric Krenz, had made the first one.
And a few weeks later he made
the Olympic team but failed to
place at Amsterdam. But by that
time the record has been shoved
up to 52 feet and a fraction of an
inch by Johnny Kuck.
Last May Rothert made his third
trip East (he had come the ond of
November with the Stanford foot
ball team that beat the Army 20
to 0 at the Yankee Stadium in one
of the greatest offensive displays
ever put on in any gridiron) and
this time he not only beat his
teammate, Krenz, but. also broke
Krenz's 1.C.4-A. record of the year
before, setting a new Intercolle
giate mark of 50 feet 3 inches. But
he still had his eye on the world's
record. Last fall he was a big fac
tor in the Cardinals' defeat of the
Army team in the Stanford sta
dium in Palo Alto, his booming

[spirals leading directly to two
scores for Pop Warner's team.
Which brings us down to 1!I30,
not forgetting to mention that in
the meantime Rothert has twice
captained the Stanford basketball
team. (He hates to be idle, this
baby!) Harlow gave promise early
in March that he was in for a big
season with the 16-pound sphere
when he defeated Herman Brix in
a dual meet with the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, he, Brix, and Krenz
all putting farther than Rose's for
mer world's record. Against U.S.C.
he did 51 35-100 feet, against Cali
fornia 51 feet 10% inches. On April
; 2(5 against Washington he won with
| 51 feet 4% inches and immediately
after the meet took a plane to the
! Fresno relays, where, that same
evening, he beat Brix again with
a put of 51 feet 4 inches! And on
May 3 at San Francisco he smashed
i the accepted world's record with a
heave of 52 feet l x /» inches. Quite
; some athlete is Mr. Rbthert!
