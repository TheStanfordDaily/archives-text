## 
### BY LAUREL LEWIS 
Under the direction of the Stan
ford School of Education, a study
of the effect of segregation in Amer
ican schools upon the educational
progress and social attitudes of
American-born Japanese children
is being conducted by Reginald
Hell, assistant in Educational Re
search, according to a statement
issued by the Secretary of the
School Friday. This study, begun
tinder a grant from the Social Sci
ence Research Fund at Stanford, is
being continued as part of a larger
investigation under the grant made
to Stanford University by the Car
negie Corporation of New York, for
the study of educational and voca
tional problems of American-born
Japanese.
The Japanese children in
school systems of the Sacramento
Valley are being studied. In four
of these systems the Oriental chil
dren are being educated in separat l
schools from the non-Orientals. In
the other four there is no segrega

tion on the basis of race. Stanford-!
Uinet mental tests are being a -
ministered to over 600 children of
'Japanese parentage from the tnird
grade through the eighth in these
schools, to discover whether tiie
comparative, groups arc? mentally
equal. Educational progress is l.e- j
ing measured by a series of I
achievement tests. Dr. Lewis M.
Ternian and Dr. Maud Merrill of
the Psychology Department, and'
Dr. 10. I'. Cubberly and Dr. Truman I
L. Kelley from the School' of Edu- '
cation are advising with lie 11 in the |
study.
Bell reports ready co-operation I
on the part of county and local J
school officials and teachers, with I
considerable interest shown i
in the study. Recent rulings by the
Attorney (Jeneral, placing Filipino ;
and Mexican children under the j
scope of the segregation law, tend
to increase interest in this study
aimed to secure valid data on the
effects of segregation.
