## 
### 
Modern Don Quixotes are
at large on the campus. It is
not known whether they are
battling with windmills or
rescuing fair maidens, but at
least they are sporting four
tin firemen's helmets, accord
ing to R. E. Dugan, fire mar
shal.
The lire chief says that the
plumed bonnets have been
gone about a month, and were
first found missing when
truck equipment was lent for
use at a recent student rally.
He intimated that while (In
department was willing to
lend its apparatus for special
occasions, bareheaded firemen
sometimes get their locks
singed.
