# COMMITTEE TO PROBE ILLINOIS CAMPAIGN FUND
## Senate Committee Decides To Begin Hearings On McCormick Case Pennsylvania Race Draws Senate Attention 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 12. (A J ) On
the basis of new information from
Illinois, the Senate Campaign
Funds Committee decided today to
begin hearing in that state as soon
as possible on the cost of the re
cent primary in which Mrs. Iluth
Hanna McCormick defeated Sena
tor Deneen for the Republican
senatorial nominal ion.
"It is fair to say," Chairman Nye
of the committee reported upon
his return from Chicago, "that
there is information such as to in
dicate that much more was spent
in behalf of the candidates than
was accounted for in their indi
vidual statements to the commit
tee."
Beyond that Senator Nye did not
go, but he was closeted with the
committee lor more than an hour
before the decision for immediate
hearings in Illinois was reached.
The committee will go there as
soon as (he legislative situation
permits, possibly this week.
The Pennsylvania primary race
between Senator Grundy and Sec
retary Davis for the Republican
nomination also received attention
at today's session but it appeared
unlikely tonight that the committee
would get. into that state before
tiie primary on May 20.
Mrs. McCormick today made pub
lic a telegram to Thomas F. Dono
van, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee of Illi
nois, suggesting that he and other
members of the Democratic com
mittee submit any charges or in
formation they have on campaign
expenditures to the Senate investi
gating committee.
