# CARD POLOISTS TO MEET O.S.C.
## Gordon Confident Of Wins Over Northerners 
### 
Meeting u luird-riding sciuad of
polo players from Oregon Slate in
a two-game series this week, the
Stanford varsity four will renew
â€¢ lie annual dispute with more than
an even chance to"revenge last
year's drubbing at the hands of
the northern outfit. The contests
are scheduled for the Highway
field on Thursday at o'clock and
Saturday at 4.
Cards Good
The Redshirt team is rated by
Captain (Jordan as the best ever to
wear the cardinal onto a polo green,
probably a team that has no peer
among any collegiate organizations.
So far this season Gordan's horse
men have jJowned the Menlo Cir
cus. Club twice, the first, time by
the lop-sided count of 21 to 1. After
taking this aggregation so easily,
the Cards journeyed up to Ather
ton again to trounce a, stronger
club team, tlie best that. Menlo
could muster, by a score of 11 to 6.
This re-vamped four included such
oldtimers as Tevis, Christen, St.
Cyr, and Alexander, well-known as
keen horsemen who travel in the
fastest polo company on the penin
sula.
Flashy Playing
Though the teamwork of the
Kami outfit gives il its claim to
supremacy, flashing individual play
is not lacking. Jack MeDougal,
holding down the key position at
number three is a last year's var
sity veteran whose brilliant work
has become more effective with
players of the same caliber to sup
port him. Captain Bud Post, an
other veteran of Stanford teams,
has had the same experience this
year, with Cedrick Uoeseke and
Abe Jensen supplying new talent
for the weak spots in former Card
squads.
The Oregon State team which
will arrive here Wednesday noon
in time to bold a light workout in
the afternoon is composed of
O'Conner at number one position,
I'rice at number two, Penney riding
at number three, and Sugnut back.
