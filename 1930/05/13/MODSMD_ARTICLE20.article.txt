# ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT TO BE SUPPLIED NEW GAUGE LABORATORY
## 
### 
Alterations are at present being
! made in the School of Engineering
|
Building by the Corporation Yard
in preparation for a complete gauge
laboratory to be furnished by the
Ordnance Department of the. United
States Army.
This equipment w.itli an est i
I mated value of from $30,000 to
i $40,000 will nive Stanford a meas
| uring laboratory matched only by
I live or six others in the T T nited
j States. Il will be (lie only one yet
placed in an educational institu-
I lion's care and is duplicated only
'by those in government arsenals.
] The laboratory will contain Bath
I inside micrometers, one super
! micrometer, a Pratt & Whitney
j measuring machine, a surface plate
and measuring blocks. The latter
I will lie correct to hundred-thou
sandths of an inch. In order to
attain such accuracy it is iieees-
Isarv to supply a microscopic cam
era which will magnify the images
j of objects to be measured and the
I guages to a large picture projected
I on a screen.
About 600 square feet of floor
I space is being partitioned oIT in the
east end of the building in which
the apparatus is to be placed, and

ilhis area will be covered with a
wooden floor above the concrete
i already t here. Such construction ol'
i flooring is necessary for protection
ol' llic delicate instruments from
concrete. dust. The apartments as
it whole will he boxed in with a
ceiling of 12-foot height to make
lhem as dnstproof as possible. H'
latei- found necessary, means lor
1 maintaining a temperature of <;;>
! degrees Fahrenheit, al which point
i the machines are most nearly per
(feci, will be supplied. The adjust
nients, costing about ifintin, yj-e ex
i pected lo be completed the lirat

According to Theodore J. Hoover,
i Dean of Engineering School, the
: gauges can be used not only as a
check for production gauges owned
bv manufacturers on the Pacific
Coast, but also for many other
physical measurements.
"Few people realize the dire ne
cessity or appreciate the value of
very accurate gauges in this era
|of mass production," slated Dean
Hoover. "The products of metal
manufacture must be very accurate
to do for their purpose. It is for
such accuracy that men have been
working In the past thousands of
years."

According to Theodore J. Hoover,
i Dean of Engineering School, the
: gauges can be used not only as a
check for production gauges owned
bv manufacturers on the Pacific
Coast, but also for many other
physical measurements.
"Few people realize the dire ne
cessity or appreciate the value of
very accurate gauges in this era
|of mass production," slated Dean
Hoover. "The products of metal
manufacture must be very accurate
to do for their purpose. It is for
such accuracy that men have been
working In the past thousands of
years."

Building by the Corporation Yard
