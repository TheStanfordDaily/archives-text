iicshniau edition. Mis accomplices, all yearlings, formed the edi
torial board and stall of that estimable publication.

Hut what of it , J Such things (and worse) have been done by
people who are supposed to know several volumes more about jour
nalism than mere freshmen.
So the older heads are proud. Ihe freshman edition was a good
paper.
\nd of one-time Kditor (ioodwin the older heads are proud.
'One time Kditor (ioodwin vigorously lived up to the best editorial
iraditions of Stanford journalism. During the single dav of his
1 ••gime lie promptly stuck his head in the lion's mouth bv discussing
the l arnis much-discussed section of femininity, Mr. (ioodwin
ciidn I realize the tact, probably, but he was borrowing trouble, lie
will .learn, il he hasn't learned already, that dicussing women is an
unprofitable pastime for Stanford editors. Whatever is said is
wrong and insulting and meddlesome and asinine. An editorial that
pleases one Stanford woman displeases 4 ( > ( J others. The editor of
ihe St.wkokd D.ui.v is invariably a detestable "buttinskv" though
he bleed and die for the harm's womanhood. Truly, woe is his who
sullies the fair name of the hive I lundred by putting it in inky type.
h.ditor (ioodwin and bis fellows lived up to another ancient and
honorable Stanford newspaper tradition by casting slurs at the form
nl nourishment dispensed in Kncina's dining hall.

the past beyond that—freshmen have complained at the qualitv of
