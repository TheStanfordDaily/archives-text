# GOD AND THE PROHIBITIONISTS

Mint the \nti-Saloon League was "born of (iod" and led bv
Mini Hi its highest and most glorious achievements was asserted bv
I Scott Mcliridcin Washington Inst Friday.
\pparently Mr. Mcl»ride and his ilk do not understand that just
itch statements as his turn modern college students (and many of
any age) away from religion.
To think that ' iod is behind the workings of the Anti Saloon
League or the W.C.T.I'. or the Y's or the Salvation Army is to
v.vc (iod associations which are too absurd to be swallowed by
I ersons of intelligence.
Fundamentalists cry to the high heavens that (iod created the
v orld in seven days of 24 hours each ; that Jonah actually explored
; whale's alimentary canal ; that modern science is atheism. And
■-till these fundamentalists wonder why America's youth is weaken
ing in its belief in formal religion.
Mr. Mcllride and his kind should consider a statement once
made by Napoleon. "(iod," said the t orsican, "is on the side of
the heaviest artillery." It is interesting to note. too. that temper-
Mice is a < ireek ideal which began in Pythagoras' conception of the
iiined lyre a well-balanced life.
And when fundamentalists' bigotry is spread over the front
pages of the nation, it is enlightening to see that even so early as the
tilth century \.l). the Christian church had its difficulties with the
tribe. In this connection St. Augustine said:
"It is a very disgraceful and pernicious thing, and one greatly
to be watched against, that any infidel should hear a Christian talk
ing wild nonsense about the earth and the heaven, about the motions
and magnitude and intervals of the stars, the courses of years and
tine--, the natures of animals, stones, and other matters uf the same
k!nd, pretending that he had the authority of the Scriptures on his
ide. The other who understands these things from reason or ex
perience, seeing that the Christian is utterly ignorant of the subject,
that he is wide of the mark by a whole heaven, cannot refrain from
la'uehler."
