HESPERIAN. James D. Hart and
Jan Maris, Editors. Summer
Issue, 1930. Fifty cents the copy.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Tlie first number of any new
periodical, particularly when the
publishers are young and unknown,
has turned upon it a. more than
ordinary critical and skeptical eye,
quick to find the aspirations of the
youthful publishers presumptious.
"Hesperian" is singularly able to
bear this Intolerant scrutiny. In
aiming at typographical perfection,
lite editors were ambitious but
their achievement proved commen
surable, and a keen perusal con
firms the, verdict pronounced by
the cursory glance: "Hesperian,"
in printing and arrangement, is
brilliantly successful. Many points
catch tlie discriminating eye- the
expensive paper, the wide margins
and beautiful spacing, and the sev
eral innovations which give "lies
perian" real distinction, such as
the printing of all the titles in
lower case lending an interesting
emphasis to each page.
Modernity in the guise of an al
most classic good taste sums up
"Hesperian." This unusual cornhina
tion is indicated in the foreword,
in which the editor submits ilia!
his magazine "will be an aid to
unknown critics and authors, now
handicapped by insufficient media
for their writings, and having to
combat not only their own obscur
ity but more seriously, (hat notor
iety of poseurs who exploit pseudo
futurism, and I hough failing to 1111
derstand modern art and literature
themselves, successl'uly dupe others
who comprehend even less."
In accordance with this ideal,
"Hesperian" is not extreme or "mod
ern" in the superficial sense, lis in
trinsic content stamps it clearly •
enough with modernity without re
sort to "pseudo-futurism."
Analyzing the contents of the
magazine, the check lis! compiled
by George Sterling himsvlf in ll»J!. r >,
brought to date and here lirst pub
lished, is a valuable index to the!
work of ibis poet. George Sterling's
own contribution is "The Mack
Hound Hays," from an unpublished
manuscript in the possession of I
Paul Elder, a poem which reveals
the poet in an unusual mood. Zeus,
a long poem by Joyce Ma hew, a
young Sari Franciscan, lias a carved
mystical beauty, curiously epil.o- |
mizing its pagan spirit. An even
more interesting poem is the son
net by Doris Lisbeth Smith, a thing
of extraordinarily lovely sound ef
fects. Nathan Van Patten's essay
on James Branch Cabell and Ar
thur Machen, bringing out analo
gies between their early works, lias
the most meat in it of anything in
the magazine, although it loses by
being too sketchy.
In spite of its general excellence,
however, the magazine suffers from
its slightness. Judging by the qual
ity of its first contents, it should
prove a vigorous and fastidious
criterion for Western art, and liter
ature, if the thinness and brevity j
of its selection in the future does ■
not result in its making too insub
stantial an impression. The first |
number is more like a sample than j
a real product. Put viewed as such
the appearance of The second nuni- ,
her is something to look forward j
to. We trust that the fall "Hes-j
perian" will be more considerable.!

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING
EARNEST. At the Er'ariger's :
Columbia, San Francisco.
In its third play, the Colbourne- 1
Jones company slips down a little j
from the high standard of excel-{
lence attained in the two former ;
plays. Perhaps the intricate, IValh- j

cry brilliance of Oscar Wilde's wit
if. moiv difficult to handle than
Shaw .-Mid Milne. Or perhaps and
this is the more likely- the com
pany was having one of those in
sidious off-nights which shows
itself in nothing tangible, and
where the explicit flaw is impos
sible to pin down, but which ever
so subtly dims a performance, and
slows iii> the tempo of the acting.
That "The Importance of Being
Earnest" was thoroughly enjoyable
even in spite of such a handicap is
a tribute to the teamwork and
poise of the repertoire. There is no
denying that a certain fine edge
and polish which made the preced
ing plays so ineffably satisfying,
i was absent in most of the roles.
And yet the character managed to
be so nearly as gay and inconse
quentially charming as Wilde in
tended fliem to be that one could
almost overlook entirely the very,
very l'aint haziness of low spirits
or ennui which hung over the
stage.
The repertoire apparently lakes
turns at individual starring. This
time Harry Jones allowed himself
to be eclipsed by Constance Pelis
sier, whose brilliant portrayal of
Lady Bracknell kept the audience
highly amused. Emphasizing this
difficult role with a pointed and
beautifully timed sense of humor
Miss Pelissier seemed to suffer
least of all the major characters
from the lassitude fogging the per
formance
i»olh Jones and Oolburne were
not wholly spontaneous. Their
roles called for light, quick, whole
hearted humor, and although both
of them smiled and laughed at the
right moments, and frolicked
around very sportively, yet more
than one moment found them
slightly heavy. One had the curious
feeling that as soon as the curtain
dropped, their laces relaxed into
tired lines, and I hey let I heir slioul
dors sag a little.
"The Importance of Being Earn-
I est" is a play which requires verve
more than anything else. It is a
clever comedy, full of lines whose
fizz-like wit is not always so harm-
I less as it seems. The situations are
delightfully and improbably gay
and keep one richly entertained,
while the characters are exquisite
ly drawn people, each one purely
! individual, yet blending in the play
in a skillful harmony. Wilde's
; workmanship is well appreciated
by these English actors, who know
how to bring out these excellencies,
regardless of the mood that they
are in. This play, in sum, is simply
another proof that the Coubourne-
Jones company is worth seeing in
any play at any time.

In its third play, the Colbourne- 1

That "The Importance of Being

even in spite of such a handicap is
a tribute to the teamwork and
poise of the repertoire. There is no
denying that a certain fine edge
and polish which made the preced

i was absent in most of the roles.
And yet the character managed to
be so nearly as gay and inconse
quentially charming as Wilde in
tended fliem to be that one could
almost overlook entirely the very,
very l'aint haziness of low spirits
or ennui which hung over the
stage.
The repertoire apparently lakes
turns at individual starring. This

to be eclipsed by Constance Pelis

beautifully timed sense of humor

not wholly spontaneous. Their
roles called for light, quick, whole

of them smiled and laughed at the
right moments, and frolicked

slightly heavy. One had the curious

"The Importance of Being Earn-
I est" is a play which requires verve
more than anything else. It is a
clever comedy, full of lines whose
fizz-like wit is not always so harm-
I less as it seems. The situations are
delightfully and improbably gay
and keep one richly entertained,
while the characters are exquisite
ly drawn people, each one purely
! individual, yet blending in the play
in a skillful harmony. Wilde's
; workmanship is well appreciated
by these English actors, who know
how to bring out these excellencies,
regardless of the mood that they
are in. This play, in sum, is simply
another proof that the Coubourne-
Jones company is worth seeing in
any play at any time.

HESPERIAN. James D. Hart and

Issue, 1930. Fifty cents the copy.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Tlie first number of any new
periodical, particularly when the
publishers are young and unknown,
has turned upon it a. more than
ordinary critical and skeptical eye,
quick to find the aspirations of the
youthful publishers presumptious.
"Hesperian" is singularly able to
bear this Intolerant scrutiny. In
aiming at typographical perfection,
lite editors were ambitious but
their achievement proved commen
surable, and a keen perusal con
firms the, verdict pronounced by
the cursory glance: "Hesperian,"
in printing and arrangement, is
brilliantly successful. Many points
catch tlie discriminating eye- the
expensive paper, the wide margins
and beautiful spacing, and the sev
eral innovations which give "lies
perian" real distinction, such as
the printing of all the titles in
lower case lending an interesting
emphasis to each page.
Modernity in the guise of an al
most classic good taste sums up
"Hesperian." This unusual cornhina
tion is indicated in the foreword,
in which the editor submits ilia!
his magazine "will be an aid to
unknown critics and authors, now
handicapped by insufficient media
for their writings, and having to
combat not only their own obscur
ity but more seriously, (hat notor
iety of poseurs who exploit pseudo
futurism, and I hough failing to 1111
derstand modern art and literature
themselves, successl'uly dupe others
who comprehend even less."
In accordance with this ideal,
"Hesperian" is not extreme or "mod
ern" in the superficial sense, lis in
trinsic content stamps it clearly •
enough with modernity without re
sort to "pseudo-futurism."
Analyzing the contents of the
magazine, the check lis! compiled
by George Sterling himsvlf in ll»J!. r >,

roles called for light, quick, whole

"The Importance of Being Earn-

more than anything else. It is a
clever comedy, full of lines whose
fizz-like wit is not always so harm-
I less as it seems. The situations are
delightfully and improbably gay

by these English actors, who know
how to bring out these excellencies,
regardless of the mood that they
are in. This play, in sum, is simply
another proof that the Coubourne-

any play at any time.

HESPERIAN. James D. Hart and
Jan Maris, Editors. Summer
Issue, 1930. Fifty cents the copy.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Tlie first number of any new
periodical, particularly when the
publishers are young and unknown,
has turned upon it a. more than
ordinary critical and skeptical eye,
quick to find the aspirations of the
youthful publishers presumptious.
"Hesperian" is singularly able to
bear this Intolerant scrutiny. In
aiming at typographical perfection,
lite editors were ambitious but
their achievement proved commen
surable, and a keen perusal con
firms the, verdict pronounced by
the cursory glance: "Hesperian,"
in printing and arrangement, is
brilliantly successful. Many points
catch tlie discriminating eye- the
expensive paper, the wide margins
and beautiful spacing, and the sev
eral innovations which give "lies
perian" real distinction, such as
the printing of all the titles in
lower case lending an interesting
emphasis to each page.
Modernity in the guise of an al
most classic good taste sums up
"Hesperian." This unusual cornhina
tion is indicated in the foreword,
in which the editor submits ilia!
his magazine "will be an aid to
unknown critics and authors, now
handicapped by insufficient media
for their writings, and having to
combat not only their own obscur
ity but more seriously, (hat notor
iety of poseurs who exploit pseudo
futurism, and I hough failing to 1111
derstand modern art and literature
themselves, successl'uly dupe others
who comprehend even less."
In accordance with this ideal,
"Hesperian" is not extreme or "mod
ern" in the superficial sense, lis in
trinsic content stamps it clearly •
enough with modernity without re
sort to "pseudo-futurism."
Analyzing the contents of the
magazine, the check lis! compiled
by George Sterling himsvlf in ll»J!. r >,
brought to date and here lirst pub
lished, is a valuable index to the!
work of ibis poet. George Sterling's
own contribution is "The Mack
Hound Hays," from an unpublished
manuscript in the possession of I
Paul Elder, a poem which reveals
the poet in an unusual mood. Zeus,
a long poem by Joyce Ma hew, a
young Sari Franciscan, lias a carved
mystical beauty, curiously epil.o- |
mizing its pagan spirit. An even
more interesting poem is the son
net by Doris Lisbeth Smith, a thing
of extraordinarily lovely sound ef
fects. Nathan Van Patten's essay
on James Branch Cabell and Ar
thur Machen, bringing out analo
gies between their early works, lias
the most meat in it of anything in
the magazine, although it loses by
being too sketchy.
In spite of its general excellence,
however, the magazine suffers from
its slightness. Judging by the qual
ity of its first contents, it should
prove a vigorous and fastidious
criterion for Western art, and liter
ature, if the thinness and brevity j
of its selection in the future does ■
not result in its making too insub
stantial an impression. The first |
number is more like a sample than j
a real product. Put viewed as such

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING

In its third play, the Colbourne- 1

pany was having one of those in
sidious off-nights which shows
itself in nothing tangible, and
where the explicit flaw is impos

so subtly dims a performance, and

That "The Importance of Being

a tribute to the teamwork and

and polish which made the preced

And yet the character managed to
be so nearly as gay and inconse
quentially charming as Wilde in
tended fliem to be that one could
almost overlook entirely the very,
very l'aint haziness of low spirits

publishers are young and unknown,
has turned upon it a. more than
ordinary critical and skeptical eye,
quick to find the aspirations of the
youthful publishers presumptious.
"Hesperian" is singularly able to
bear this Intolerant scrutiny. In
aiming at typographical perfection,
lite editors were ambitious but
their achievement proved commen
surable, and a keen perusal con
firms the, verdict pronounced by
the cursory glance: "Hesperian,"
in printing and arrangement, is
brilliantly successful. Many points
catch tlie discriminating eye- the
expensive paper, the wide margins
and beautiful spacing, and the sev
eral innovations which give "lies
perian" real distinction, such as
the printing of all the titles in
lower case lending an interesting
emphasis to each page.
Modernity in the guise of an al
most classic good taste sums up
"Hesperian." This unusual cornhina
tion is indicated in the foreword,
in which the editor submits ilia!
his magazine "will be an aid to
unknown critics and authors, now
handicapped by insufficient media
for their writings, and having to
combat not only their own obscur
ity but more seriously, (hat notor
iety of poseurs who exploit pseudo
futurism, and I hough failing to 1111
derstand modern art and literature
themselves, successl'uly dupe others
who comprehend even less."
In accordance with this ideal,
"Hesperian" is not extreme or "mod
ern" in the superficial sense, lis in
trinsic content stamps it clearly •
enough with modernity without re
sort to "pseudo-futurism."
Analyzing the contents of the
magazine, the check lis! compiled
by George Sterling himsvlf in ll»J!. r >,
brought to date and here lirst pub
lished, is a valuable index to the!
work of ibis poet. George Sterling's
own contribution is "The Mack
Hound Hays," from an unpublished
manuscript in the possession of I
Paul Elder, a poem which reveals
the poet in an unusual mood. Zeus,
a long poem by Joyce Ma hew, a
young Sari Franciscan, lias a carved
mystical beauty, curiously epil.o- |
mizing its pagan spirit. An even
more interesting poem is the son
net by Doris Lisbeth Smith, a thing
of extraordinarily lovely sound ef
fects. Nathan Van Patten's essay
on James Branch Cabell and Ar
thur Machen, bringing out analo
gies between their early works, lias
the most meat in it of anything in
the magazine, although it loses by
being too sketchy.
In spite of its general excellence,
however, the magazine suffers from
its slightness. Judging by the qual
ity of its first contents, it should
prove a vigorous and fastidious
criterion for Western art, and liter
ature, if the thinness and brevity j
of its selection in the future does ■
not result in its making too insub
stantial an impression. The first |
number is more like a sample than j
a real product. Put viewed as such
the appearance of The second nuni- ,
her is something to look forward j
to. We trust that the fall "Hes-j
perian" will be more considerable.!

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING
EARNEST. At the Er'ariger's :
Columbia, San Francisco.
In its third play, the Colbourne- 1
Jones company slips down a little j
from the high standard of excel-{
lence attained in the two former ;
plays. Perhaps the intricate, IValh- j

cry brilliance of Oscar Wilde's wit
if. moiv difficult to handle than
Shaw .-Mid Milne. Or perhaps and
this is the more likely- the com
pany was having one of those in
sidious off-nights which shows
itself in nothing tangible, and
where the explicit flaw is impos
sible to pin down, but which ever
so subtly dims a performance, and
slows iii> the tempo of the acting.
That "The Importance of Being
Earnest" was thoroughly enjoyable
even in spite of such a handicap is
a tribute to the teamwork and
poise of the repertoire. There is no
denying that a certain fine edge
and polish which made the preced
ing plays so ineffably satisfying,
i was absent in most of the roles.
And yet the character managed to
be so nearly as gay and inconse
quentially charming as Wilde in
tended fliem to be that one could
almost overlook entirely the very,
very l'aint haziness of low spirits
or ennui which hung over the
stage.
The repertoire apparently lakes
turns at individual starring. This
time Harry Jones allowed himself
to be eclipsed by Constance Pelis
sier, whose brilliant portrayal of
Lady Bracknell kept the audience
highly amused. Emphasizing this
difficult role with a pointed and
beautifully timed sense of humor
Miss Pelissier seemed to suffer
least of all the major characters
from the lassitude fogging the per
formance
i»olh Jones and Oolburne were
not wholly spontaneous. Their
roles called for light, quick, whole
hearted humor, and although both
of them smiled and laughed at the
right moments, and frolicked
around very sportively, yet more
than one moment found them
slightly heavy. One had the curious
feeling that as soon as the curtain
dropped, their laces relaxed into
tired lines, and I hey let I heir slioul
dors sag a little.
"The Importance of Being Earn-
I est" is a play which requires verve
more than anything else. It is a
clever comedy, full of lines whose
fizz-like wit is not always so harm-
I less as it seems. The situations are
delightfully and improbably gay
and keep one richly entertained,
while the characters are exquisite
ly drawn people, each one purely
! individual, yet blending in the play
in a skillful harmony. Wilde's
; workmanship is well appreciated
by these English actors, who know
how to bring out these excellencies,
regardless of the mood that they
are in. This play, in sum, is simply
another proof that the Coubourne-
Jones company is worth seeing in
any play at any time.
