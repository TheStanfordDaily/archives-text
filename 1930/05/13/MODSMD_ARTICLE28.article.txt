# Campus Opinion
## ANOTHER TESTIMONIAL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Recently circumstances caused
my confinement for several days at
Mrs. Morrison's Rest Home for
Stanford men. The experience
prompts me to remark about one
of the finest institutions on our
campus.
The modest policy associated
with the Rest Mom.' Ikis prevented
many people knowing of the ad
vantages it offers. This is truly
unfortunate, for there are undoubt
edly many students who would be
greatly benefited by its services.
There are none of us who escape
occasional low-tide periods of
physical and mental vitality. In the
environment ot a fraternity house
or a dormitory it is practically im
possible to recuperate normally.
At such times the Rest Home tils

llie hill perfect]v. One enjoys quiet
ness, REAL home-cooked food, and
a r«-st I'ul homo atmosphere. The
att••lition which one receives from
Airs. Morrison could hardly he more
conscientious if it were one's own
mother giving it. She is one of
I hose rare persons who can take
care of one without being a nui
sance. There is no irritating hos
pital routine about the place. In
Tact, it is exactly what its name
suggests--a rest home.
Through this column I wish to
express my gratitude to the Stan
ford Mothers Club, who sponsors
the institution, the University, and
Mrs. Morrison for the benefit I ob
tained during my visit, and to con
gratulate them on the splendid ser
vice the West Home is performing.
Ward Foultz,
