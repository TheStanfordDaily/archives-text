### Darrell Amyx THE DOODLE BUG 
i
| Tucked away in his crater safely,,
snugly,
Feasting royally, richly, "doodle-}
bugly,"
Called, perhaps in more fitting
nomenclat lire,
Not, however, to suit his finer
nature,
Myrmeleen "Ant-lion," if he
knows you—
Our neuropterous larva gladly
shows you
How ingeniously he obtains subsis
tence,
Leading, truly, a very strange
existence.
Though he's never in danger of
siarvat ion.
Having plenty of time for medita
t ion,
"Sandy-grey, and ticket with warts
and bristles"
(Aping cacti, perhaps, or even
thistles) . , . ,
Thus Britannica paints him for its
readers ....
Mister Doodle-Hug, classed among
the leaders
In the science and skill of excava-i
t ion,
Throws his foes into fits of con
sternation.
He moves backward, and at a rate
terrific
Digs a pit for his prey—to be
specific,
Some poor ant, or another likely
victim;
Ilis anatomy sternly gives the dic
tum
Not to live dissolutely or corruptly:
llis intestinal tract ends most
abrupt ly!
But he, by no blind alley to be
bested.
Eats and drinks only blood that's
pre-digested;
Hence his luckiest break, beyond
all question,
lis that he's never pained with in
digos! ion.
