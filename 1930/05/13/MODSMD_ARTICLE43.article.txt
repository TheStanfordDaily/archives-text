# INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET TO BE RUN OFF ON SATURDAY
## Southern California Will Be Probable Winners By Twenty Point Margin 
### Bob Van Etten 
Tins California Intercollegiate
Tin<â€¢ U and Field Meet, originally
planned for this Friday and Satur
day, may bu run off on Saturday
afternoon alone, if arrangements
now being made by Alfred K. Mas
ters, general manager of the Board
of Atlifetie Control, come through
as is desired.
Inasmuch as trial heats will be
necessary in only the sprints and
hurdle races, Stanford officials be
lieve that one day will be sufficient
time for tile meet. It is pointed out
that, the Pacific Association meet
in San Francisco took less than
four hours to complete even though
several events not included in in
tercollegiate competition were on
the schedule.
Featuring a return engagement
of Stanford versus Southern Cali
fornia, with California and U.C.L.A.
also entering teams, the California
lulorcollegiates is expected to be
the track classic of the Pacific
Coast.
Once again interest focuses on
the sprints where Frank Wykoff,
who last Saturday stepped the 100-
yard dash in !) and 2-5 seconds to
set a new world's record, meets
Hoc Dyer, conqueror of Wykoff in
the Card-Trojan dual tilt.
Perhaps the most formidable ar
ray of hurdlers ever competing in
one meet is lined up in the timber
topping races. Podge Smith of Stan
lord, Pogolotti of California, Welch,
Carls, and Payne of U.S.C., and
Knight of f'.C.L.A., should stage
close battles in both stick events.
Comparative performances make
u Southern California victory al
most certain, probably by a margin
of close to 20 points. Unless
"pink" Templeton's athletes cash
in on every break the Cardinal will
suffer a second defeat at the hands
of Dean Cromwell's Trojans. Cali
fornia, although with only a half
dozen men likely to break into the
scoring column, should collect close
to 30 points to grab third place.
