The changes, as outlined yesterday by Stanford Steinbeck, student
body president, are principally minor ones. The majority of them are
in the re-wording of the existing structure to make il clearer and at
the same time briefer.

The basis of granting polo awards
is changed to competition in one
hall' the time of all matches in
stead of all intercollegiate inatchos
only as is slated in (lie present
constitution. This modification is
designed to make it possible; for
morn awards to bo granted in polo
than heretofore.
(Jolt' awards are to be granted to
students taking honors in the
Pacific Coast Conference Golf
Tournament instead of tlio Pacific
Intercollegiate tournament, which
is held at Del Monte annually, un
der the new structure.
The power to charter sncli stu
dent organizations as it may deem

pointees to this body by the Execu
tive Committee is correspondingly
reduced from two to one.

tions is to be published two weeks
in advance instead of a month, and
amendments to the constitution are
to be printed in the Daily twice

that there is no official board. The
number of signatures necessary to
petition a special election or an
amendment is changed from 50 to
150. One hundred signatures are
necessary to petition a change in
the by-laws, instead of 25.

by-laws. The yell leader positions
are also designated in the by-laws
under the new structure.
Finally, a provision lias been
made obligating the appointment of
a constitutional revision committee;
