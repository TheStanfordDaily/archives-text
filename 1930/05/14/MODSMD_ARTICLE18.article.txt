# FOUR CARDS TO ENTER TOURNEY
## Easton, Hall, Plymire, And Weesner To Play 
### 
Headed by Larry Hall, four of !
the highest rahking varsity netruen
I will leave at 2 o'clock this after
| noon for the University of Oregon
! to compete in the annual Pacific
J Coast intercollegiate champion- :
j ships Friday and Saturday. Ted
j Easton, Larry Hall, Harry Plymire, I
j and Chuck Weesner will represent!
i the Cardinal.
All the prominent schools on the!
coast will enter teams with the ex
ception of California, whose top
i men. Meulileisen and Muench, are
!on their way East to engage in J
| tournament competition.
Jack de Lara, the black-haired
I flash from U.S.C., is favored to win
j the coast championships in the ab- \
I sence of Meulileisen, on the basis 1
j of his showing in the Minor Sports i
j Carnival. But Stanford fans remein
j her a hot day last quarter when
Ted Easton bobbed all over the
I court in the Conference matches i
with U.S.C. and completely upset
; the Southern star. He may repeat,
j if the style of game he has shown J
| of late is a reliable indication.
Weesner and Larry Driscoll were
I scheduled to play a match deciding
| who should be the fourth man on 1
j Stanford's team, bill Driscoll was
| forced to withdraw due to an in-i
| jury to his foot.
j Singles and doubles will be on
| lap at Eugene Ibis week-end. Eas i
| ton-Hall and Plymire-Weesner will
! probably lie the Card teams.
