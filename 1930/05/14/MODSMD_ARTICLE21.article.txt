# U.S.C. SENDS UP 36 TRACKSTERS
## Card Hopes in Cinder Meet Rest on Morrison 
### 
l)eun Cromwell will bring the
full .strength of his Trojan track
and field squad north for the Cali
fornia Intercollegiates to be held
in the Stanford Stadium this Sat- j
urday afternoon. Entry lists re- j
ceived hero yesterday by Track \
Manager Robert liell name 36 |
Southern California athletes who j
will attempt to down "Dink" Tem- i
pleton's Cardinals for the second '
time this year.
A total of 101 men are entered in
the college track and field classic, j
Stanford will be represented by 34 j
cinderpath performers, California j
by 19, and U.C.L.A. by 12.
Inasmuch as there are not j
enough men entered in either the j
sprint or hurdles races to necessi- j
tate trial heats, the meet will be j
held entirely on Saturday after- I
noon, with the javelin beginning at j
1:45, and the mile starting at 2 i
o'clock.
Depends on Morrison
"What small chance Stanford has J
of crashing through to capture j
enough upsets to defeat the Tro- |
jails depends largely upon the con- j
dition of Johnny Morrison, star j
quarter-miler. Morrison is still fa- j
voting his injured leg, burl in prac
tice before the Washington meet
when the Card 440 ace knotted a ;
muscle. I'nless Johnny is in perfect j
shape by Saturday it is doubtful !
that he will run since Coach Tern- I
pleton would prefer to tnk.â€¢ no j
chances but save his premier quar- j
ter-miler for the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet !
at the end of this month.
Should Morrison not be able to j
compete, the Cardinals will lose j
not only 5 certain points in the i
440, l)ui in all likelihood the relay
as well. Dean Cromwell's quartet j
covered the four laps last Saturday i
against mediocre competition in
3:17.0 which indicates that the
Stanford baton-passers will have to I
run close to their world's record j
time if they are to remain unde
fealed.
