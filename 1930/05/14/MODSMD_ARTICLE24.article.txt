# CAGLE REVEALS MARRIAGE; OUT OF WEST POINT
## Married Secretly For Two Years to Louisiana Girl Against Academy Rules Resignation Deprives Star Of Honors and Diploma; Will Sell Bonds, Coach 
### 
WEST POINT, N.Y., May 13. (/p)
— Christian Keener (Red) Cagle
resigned abruptly as a cadet today
from the United States Military
Academy, by official request, fol
lowing the revelation that he was
married nearly two years ago in
direct violation of the cadet regula
tions, subsequently gaining ail-
American gridiron honors and dis
tinction as one of the greatest
Army halfbacks of all time.
Thus, in the swirling succession
of events that within the past few
days have beset the famous red
head like a flock of Stanford or
Notre Dame tacklers, romance has
brought a sudden finish to Cagle's
military career.
Much as today's developments
shocked official West Point and
those who hold Army regulations
in high respect, drama continued
to surround the exciting career of
Cagle. From a hospital bed, where;
he was recovering from an opera
tion for the removal of his tonsils,
the Army star handed in his resig
nation after being advised that,
press dispatches from New Orleans
had disclosed the details of his
marriage on August 25, 1!»2S, to
Marion Munford Halle at Gretna,
La., by a justice of the peace.
Bride Denies Wedding
On her way to New York, Cagle's
bride of nearly two years stopped
in Atlanta to deny they were mar
ried, apparently in the hope that
the concealment might be main
tained. However, at about the same
time her husband was admitting
the marriage to Colonel M. A.
Shockley, post surgeon at. West,
Point.
Now, his resignation on the way
to Washington for formal accept
ance, Cagle will leave West Point
just a month before the date on
which be was to have'been gradu
ated as one of the most distin
guished members of his class.
He had planned to resign, any
way, because of the acceptance of
a contract to coach football at
Mississippi A. & M. College and
also to enter the bond-selling busi
ness in New Orleans, but he is
now deprived of the honor of finish
ing his course and gaining an of
ficer's commission.
