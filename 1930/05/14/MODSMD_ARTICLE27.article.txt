# A 						NEW CHARTER
## 
### 
I lie Stanlord campus awoke yesterday morning to find another
legal document staring it in the lace. Designed to eliminate the
ambiguous and unnecessary provisions of the present instrument, a
new Associated Students of Stanford I niversitv constitution is in
the process of public digestion.
I he existing constitution was adopted three years ago when
the then ruling governmental contract had proved inadequate to
care tor the growing student body needs. The proposed constitution
does not replace a useless instrument, but rather a document in
tended to remedy faults.
'I he changes offered by the new charter are minor and the politi
cal meaning of the document is essentially the same as under the
existing constitution.
Doubtless the constitution will be favorably received at Friday's
election. In order that each student might recognize the worth
of the proposed charter and be qualified to vote upon it, the Daily
recommends that its perusal be accomplished before the individual
makes a choice at the ballot boxes.
