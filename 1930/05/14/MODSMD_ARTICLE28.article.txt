Stanford women's Pan-Hellenic has been blessed or cursed, as!
the case may be. with a rotation system of electing presidents. j
1 lie highest executive office of the sorority organization passes j
from one house to another until ten years have passed. Then it !
begins all over again. Just like a children's game.
I hat such an iron-bound system is going to have its disadvan- i
tages is quite evident. Fxecutive strength and weakness do not j
lollow houses around in a circle. Some system whereby the best |
talent could be secured for the presidential position is highlv de-|
sirable. The rotation system smacks of the old form of hereditary'
succession.
The end of the tenth year is 1930. If the present system could
be changed before the close of this year, many difficulties of the
next decade would be eliminated. If rotation is allowed to stay
one more year, it will be here for the next ten —as the matter can !
hardly be brought up again for another decade out of deference to 1
impartiality and fairness to nil houses concerned.
It is high time for I 'an-l lellenic to realize that this antiquated j
circle system of presidents is not the best for their needs. The most j
efficient organization must have the most efficient leader. Annual j
elections are the only sensible answer.
Twice already this year, the sorority houses have turned down |
the proposed yearly election for fear it will lead to "political'' com- !
plications. Actually, Stanford women have always been singularly j
i ree of (ireek politics—and the houses would only be safeguarding!
themselves by adopting the annual elections.
bar be it from the Daily to conjure up phantoms of lower
division elimination, but there are those who see the handwriting on
the wall. The next ten years will be significant for Stanford I'ni-|
versity—and for Stanford sororities.

the best interests of sororities in the changing status of the I'ni- I
versit v.
