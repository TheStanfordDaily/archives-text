# GETTING DOWN TO FINE POINTS

11nndrcd-thousandths of an iiurh are a bit beyond the compre-j
liension of most Stanford students. We're content to call it a six- |
lecnth-of-an-inch â€”and let it go at that.
lint Stanford's School of Engineering will soon have a gauge
laboratory with equipment capable of measuring hundred-thou
sandths of an inch. Splitting hairs will be an actuality. The micro
scopic measurement is made possible by a camera which magnifies j
images of objects to be measured and the gauges to a large picture \
projected on a screen.
The equipment, valued at about $40,000 and furnished by the
ordnance department of the armv, can be matched by only five or
six similar laboratories in the nation. Stanford is the first educa
tional institution to possess such a plant.
The master gauges in the Stanford laboratory will be used as
a check for production gauges owned by manufacturers on the !
Pacific Coast and also for many other physical measurements, ac- |
cording to Theodore J. Hoover, engineering school dean.
l ew people are mechanically minded enough to appreciate the I
value of accurate gauges in this era of mass production. Men have :
been working for decades to perfcct instruments of such exactness
as those being installed here.
I )ean Hoover predicts that competitive production will soon
demand instruments of utmost accuracy. There will be a large
demand for college men trained in the new vocation of "gauge en
gineering. ' Stanford is fortunate in being a pioneer in this field.
