STEPDAUGHTERS OF WAR. By
Helen Z. Smith. E. P. Dutton,
New York. 1930.
Several years ago 1 heard a
I prominent book critic lament the
lark of tiny great volume of World
I War literature. This satin* critic
| must, by this time, be sick of it.
i After a decade of comparative si
lence, war books are now the bane
•of our literary diet.
To the casual reader it would
'seem that every viewpoint, every
; bias on the great, conflict luis been
> covered. Hut here is a new one:
(lie war as seen and fell by a lint
ish woman ambulance driver,
j "Helen Z. Smith," it is obvious
from the name, is a nom de plume.
"Stepdaughters of War" presents
that now stereotyped line of
thought -"war is hell my Cod, the
blood —when is the. damn, thing
going to end."
Pushed into the war by a spurt
of patriotism, Driver Smith, V.A.1).,
. records her thoughts as site
changes from an English society
girl to a fatalistic robot. This
; "stream of consciousness" seems
to be the only style possible in
i which to write war stories.
, The book, itself, is a paradox,
j The author, in setting down cold
fact and realistic dialogue, shows
an obvious attempt to write with
out sentiment. Yet this very at-
I tempt makes the story sentimental.
One feels in every line that he is
being impressed with the fact that
' a good, clean society girl went
through all this.
The descriptions are good, and

] also valuable insofar as they pre
sent the work of tlie ambulance
driver. The book lacks continuity,
I but that se'ins to be regarded by
modern writers as unnecessary.
A year ago this work would have
been termed "a piece of marvelous
reality." Today ii is only the usual,
and will create no great stir.

HOLiDAY. At the President Thea
tre, San Francisco.
Wherein the popular Dale Win
ner (Mrs. Duffy) makes her annual
| appearance here, ibis time as the
! lead in Philip Barry's comedy on
; riches vs. leisure, a topic which
j bribers every college man sooner
or later.
The play is average entertain
ment. Dale Winter is good, as
usual, and the wise-cracking Nick
j Potter (Robert Keith) is one of
| those clever comedians who make
you laugh at anything they say.
j Hut aside from these two, the cast
jis just Duffy average.
There is some side-splitting dia
logue in "Holiday," where Dale
i Winter and Keith stand toe to toe
' in the middle of the stage and swap
j verbal punches until someone is
| floored by wit. The rest of the play
| chases ilself vip blind alleys of
] situation and cross-situation with
j out getting anywhere; it brings up
j all the enigmas of modern society,
i throws them at the audience, and
ends without deciding whether
riches, love, or fidelity is the proper
guiding liglu for erring footsteps.
Mrs. Duffy is good, however.
