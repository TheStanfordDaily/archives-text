# "TALKIES" WILL NEVER COMPLETELY REPLACE LEGITIMATE STAGE â€“ DALE WINTER
## 
### W.H. G 
There are fit least two necessi
ties for a successful stage career
j liarcl work and ability; and Dale
j Winter lias both these qualities
! combined with a personality that
'makes her a pleasure to meet and
! talk to. She and her husband,
Henry Duffy, have in a few years
built up a chain of nine playhouses
on this coast that has a crowd of
; followers as steady uh the Coast
I League baseball fans. Whenever
! Dale Winter is scheduled to ap
pear, the bleachers are filled with
!an enthusiastic crowd, and she
! usually makes a home run.
Mrs. Duffy's black eyes and even
smile bespeak ability; and she
: is a small, nattily dressed woman
i with black hair and all the poise
in the world. She favors college
j education, for stage folk as well as
| for economics or engineering as
j pirants, although the roster of
[ Duffy players shows that an A.B.
lis not a necessary pass to ihe
world of drama. Mr. Duffy lias

i been on the stage since he was 12
years old, the little red school
house having gone by the boards i
at that tender age. His wife had
one year at Ohio Slate University,
and of all the other Duffy actors
and actresses, not half a dozen are
college alumni. They usually come
up through the ranks, and are gen
erally born to the stage.
Of course, we had to ask Dale
Winter the big question of the 1
hour, as regards the stage's future:
will the talkies entirely supplant '
the stage, continue at the present
two-to-one ratio, or dwindle to less
importance than at present? She |
feels, as Edgar Royce and Arthur '
Hardy do, that the theatre-going
public will always demand the per-!
sonal appearance of their favorites.
"Talkies are just like canned
peaches," she concluded. "People
eai them from the tin, but they will
always want fresh fruit and legiti
mate stage productions just the
j same."
