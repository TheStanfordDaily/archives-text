# FEW FIRES FOUND ON CAMPUS. SAYS MARSHAL DUGAN
## Prevention Policy Used To Lessen Fire Hazard Of University 
### 
"Tin- Stanford campus has but
ono-tenth as many fires as t lie
oilier communities in tlie vicinity,"
stated Fire Marshal It. 10. Dugan.
"The infrequency of fires is due to
careful fire prevention, rather than
successful fire-fighting, for it is
easier to prevent than to put out
fires."
fu keeping with the prevention
policy of the department, tlie mar
shal went on to announce that 110
(ilien fires will be permitted on the
campus after June 1. He advised
all residents of the University to
dispose of their rubbish now, for
the burning of unnecesasry rubbish
will not lie permitted after May 31.
"Smokers should be very care
ful this spring," Dugan warned,
"for the abundance of dry grass
about ibf campus presents an ex
ceedingly dangerous fire hazard. To
date, however, we have had no
grass fires."
Every week the fire department
is given a practice run to familiar
ize the men with the location of
the alarm boxes. A force of ten
men is maintained at the R.O.T.C.
department, while ten more are
stationed at the fire house. Five
men are always on duty at the lire
house during the night.
"We have a volunteer force of
3,000," said the fire marshal with a
smile, "and as movers and helpers
they are invaluable. A fire is as
good as a circus for attracting a
crowd, and we certainly have
enough students on hand to assist
us whenever a fire breaks out."
