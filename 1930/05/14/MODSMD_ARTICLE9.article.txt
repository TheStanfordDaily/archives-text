### 
VALLEY STREAM, N.V., May
US. (/J') â€”With bad luck pursuing
him all the way from the Pacific
Coast, Capt. Roscoe Turner made
a forced landing in his big high
wing monoplane at Curtiss Field
tonight, not more than three quar
ters of an hour too late to break
the one-stop record set by Col. and
Mrs. Charles A. Lindbergh last
Easter Day.
His destination was Roosevelt
Field, but as lit; soared 3,000 feet
over this field lie observed that his
gasoline was nearly gone and de
cided to come down.
Despite his weariness from the
long hard fliglit, lie called for more
fuel and prepared to continue to
Roosevelt Field, where a crowd of
3,000 was waiting to welcome him.
Then lie discovered that, one of his
plane's wheels had been broken in
landing.
Turner brought with him a lion
cub, which seemed to have enjoyed
the trip. Both the flier and his mas
cot wore parachutes.
