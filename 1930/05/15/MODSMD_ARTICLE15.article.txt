## Lagunita Water Level Is Low For Traditional Aquatic Sports Opera "Mardi Gras" Will End Up 1931 Week 
### 
Exhibition diving, relays, and
j novelty races will be the main lea- j
! tares of tlie annual Water Sports,!
; to be held Saturday morning at ten |
I o'clock at the men's pool, according I
| tf> Bill Best, chairman of the event, j
Lagunita is the traditional scene I
| of action, but the low level of the!
; lake this season has necessitated I
the change to Encina swimming
! pool. The rapid drop of the lake's
wat.erline has made necessary the
! complete elimination this year of
I the annual Water Carnival.
An exhibition of fancy and high
! diving, by Ed j'hrondson, Intercol
j leglate diving champion, and Pete
Desjardines, Olympic Games diving i
| champion, will be the first event on
! the program. This will be followed
! by a 440-yard free-style race. Tro
| phies will be awarded to the first
i and second-place winners. Cups
| for first and second high-point men j
! in the novelty races, the third l'ea-I
; ture of the program, will also be ]
1 awarded.
Fourth on the scheduled program i
| will be the Jnterclass Relay. The I
j class captains are as follows: Sen- i
Mors, Reg Harrison; Juniors, Whitey j
Burns; Sophomores, Austin Clapp; !
I Freshmen, Brad Pease.
Last on the program will he a ;
j joint comedy act by Desjardines ;
| and Tlirondson.
Plan Cord Ball
Water Sports is only part of the ]
whole program for Junior Week, i
which is under the general direc
! tion of Bill Earle. Friday afternoon, .
'from three until five, the annual j
! Cord Ball will be given at the j

1 to attend. The cords do not have |
j to be clean, states Joe Thompson,!
! chairman of the event.
