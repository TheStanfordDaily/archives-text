' MOM BAY, India, May 14. (/pj
' All India was tense toniglit as Mrs.
Sarojini Naidu, successor to Ma
hatma Gandhi as head of the civil
resistance movement, went ahead
'with her plans to descend on the
salt depot :it Dharsana. The Gov
ernment appeared equally deter
mined there would be no raid.
Mrs. Naidu visited Bombay to
day and then returned to Kuradi
en route to Dharsana to which she
is planning to lead a group of vol
junteers as a determined gesture
against the Government. Mahaftna
Gandhi's plan to lead a similar raid
was one of the chief causes for his
eventual arrest ten days ago.
The Government is taking drastic
precautions against any attack on
the salt depot. It has issued an ol
der prohibiting the assembly of
; more than four persons in the
'neighborhood of Dharasana and is
stated to have transferrer! the
whole police force of Jalapur to
i the threatened point.
