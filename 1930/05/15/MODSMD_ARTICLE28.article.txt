# MILITARISM AT STANFORD
## 
### 
I lie following statement i-- included in the mimeographed sylla
tin given to students taking .Mining and Metallurgy 101, a course
rivm by tin- Stan fori I School of Knginecring:
I'RIII'AKEDXICSS
I lie human race develops by war and succeeds in war
in proportion to it> use of metals; races perish in peace.
< ulture is increased hy invention of new weapons.
I lie pacifist errs in assuming that peace is desirable,
kmerson says everything we have must he paid for. We
\niericaus are living in unpaid luxury and must pav in the
luture hy blood and hard work.
I lie Uaii.y wonders just what this means. Militarism anvwhere
is bad enough; but militarism on a university campus seems almost
unbelicval tie.
I here can be but one interpretation of such philosophy as this:
"'I lie pacifist errs in assuming that peace is desirable . . . races
perish in peace."
Statement - like those'.are to be expected from the militarists of
I'.urope and from sections ot the press of America, but thev are
hoiking in an American university where men and women are
supposed to think in terms ot humanity.
I he School of Engineering should wipe out this statement at
once. The tiling may be small, but nothing militaristic is too small
to be overlooked in these days when men are struggling to end the
horrid savagery known as war. If Stanford is to hold a place of
leadership in the field of education, she must be a leader in this
struggle for peace.
