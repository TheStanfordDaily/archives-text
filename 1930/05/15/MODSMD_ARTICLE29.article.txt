\ popular indoor sport at Stanfordâ€”and in all other communi
lies, lur that matter is panning the daily newspaper. More criti
i isms and more surest ions can lie cooked up in a lay group within
five minutes than eotild he turned ont bv a trained editorial mind in
live years.
Perhaps the most traditional criticism of America's press is that
newsmen and editorial writers are superficial: thev do not prohe to
the bottom of things; they go off half-cocked.
.Vewsmen and editorial writers are willing to admit, usually, that
the charge is justified, sometimes. America's press is by no means
perfect, lint it isn't as bad as many people believe. It couldn't be
uiihout mining the nation.
New men and editorialists resent this continual fault finding;
bill there is nothing they may do to set things right. As long as
human nature is such that people persist in moiTthing half-truths
concerning things of which thev know nothing, the embattled press
must go on being embattled.
\ll 'if this is very, ver\ useless, of course. \ waste of time and
ink.
Ihe immediate cause of this outburst was trivial. A group of
indents on the Ouad yesterday waxed loud concerning the stupidity
of the Dailv because it twice published the new constitution.
May I lie Daily point out to these critics that the publication of
ih< new constitution is required by student law. 'I he Daily does
not enjoy printing the new constitution. In fact, it abhors the sight
of the thing. It gets into print because of necessity; not through
ehoice. The Daiia is a student body publication, and is run for the
indent body, following student bodv rules.
The new constitution will appear again Friday. It is sincerelv
hoped thai s< nsitive members of ihe student bodv will bear up under
the si rain.
