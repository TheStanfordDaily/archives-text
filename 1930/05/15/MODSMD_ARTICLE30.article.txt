home environment to the campus. For seven years, the Stanford
Mothers' Club, composed of the mothers of students who live in
the Kay district, has done invaluable service for University students.
In vacations especially, the Club provides Christmas and Thanks
giving dinners and entertainment to students from far-distant com
munities.

run completely by the Club and have filled a real need in the
campus life. Convalescing students are given a place to rest quietly
with sympathetic care. Fond—such as mother used to cook—is one
