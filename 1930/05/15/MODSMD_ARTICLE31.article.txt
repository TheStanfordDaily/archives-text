CHILDREN OF PLEASURE—At
the New Stanford Theatre.
Sentimental, but not unpleasant
; ly .so, with one hour very much
worth listening; to, and an even,
pleasing <asi which extracts every
bit of drama and comedy out of
the rather thin material which the
show offers, "Children of Pleasure"
] is passable entertainment, at least,
and perhaps more, if you like.pretty
hlbndes.
For th(! blonde in lliis picture
lakes a beautiful close-up, which
her inability to act does not seri
j ously impair. The other girl docs
some good acting, and has nice
'eyes, hut should not. have tried to
sing. There are spasmodic attempts
| at humor and high drama through
| out the show, and the fadeout is a J
little hysterical. And of course the!
song writer hero stands in the mid
die of a night, club and sinl*.;, a
love tune to the heroine with
supreme unconcern for the dozens
| of couples which are dancing all
around him.
However these flaws are fairly
minor. "Children of Pleasure" cer
tainly won't pay for thinking lo
morrow's examination, yel ii is
above the average so far us the
lighter song and dance pictures go.

STEPHEN ESCOTT. By Ludwig
Lewisohn. Harper and Broth- ,
ers, New York. 1930. At the
Stanford Bookstore.
"Stephen Escott" is written in a
i lovely prose style, smooth, finished,
musical; il has stimulating ideas;
it thrusts at "the core" of Ameri
can life; but it is much too long.
Even a beautiful style cannot carry

over three hundred pages material
which could have been better ex
pressed in two hundred. Lewisohn
repeats at nauseum —a good phrase
which sounds right whatever it
may mean'.
In fact, the background of the
whole novel is merely a repetition,
an enlargement, of the author's
ideas on what is wrong with Ameri- !
can sex life and American morals
as expressed in his autobiography, i
"Upstream." Stephen Escott is the
repressed individual, lie thinks his
natural desires are something to
be ashamed of. He dreams neu
rotic dreams and considers himself
very, very bad. "What you need," ,
says his friend, David Sampson,
"is a little honest dissipation." In
stead of dissipating, Stephen gets
ma ri'ied.
Marriage doesn't end liis trou
bles,-however. His wife, Dorothy,!
is a colli person who thinks "men
are beasts." Stephen is not awfully !
sorry when she dies. In his search
for the perfect life, he pursues Bea
trice Loth, Greenwich village, free
love, lint Beatrice is at the oppo- j
site extreme; she thinks of noth
ing but the elemental side of love.
Poor Stephen is just out of luck,
tie cannot lind the right kind of i
woman. And his plight, of course,
is America's.
"Stephen Escott" misses great
ness by a good-sized margin. Lew
isohn's gripe against the world is
that Americans still regard sex as
something to be repressed or to be
laughed at, and he does not hesi
tate to say so. In our opinion, a
novelist is lirsl of all, a story
teller, not a preacher, a reformer,
or :i soap-box orator. "Stephen Es- j
eott" is an essay in novel form.
