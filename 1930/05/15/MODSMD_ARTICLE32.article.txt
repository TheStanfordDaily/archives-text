# FOUNDRY STUDENTS POUR TON OF IRON INTO SAND MOLDS IN ENGINEERING SHOP
## 
### 
Casting day in the mechanical
engineering foundry was quite a
novelty eight or ten years ago, ac
cording to James 1!. Liggett, teach
ing specialist in foundry practice.
At that time men, women, and stu
dents gathered each time to see
tlie molten white iron tapped out
of the furnace and distributed to
molds.
More than a hundred castings,
necessitating about a ton of iron,
were poured yesterday afternoon
before about 20 spectators. The
furnace or cupola was going full
blast to provide the liquid metal
and students hustled about to pre
pare crucibles for its conveyance.
In the morning Liggett himself
had entered the furnace from a
door in the flue and climbed hand
over hand on a rope down the two
foot hole to plaster the inside of
the furnace with a sand bed. When
this operation was finished, a sack
of shavings and kindling wood
were added to start combustion of
coke. Coke and iron, in the ratio
of one pound of coke to seven of
pig iron, were then dropped in the

{cupola, first being carefully
■weighed.
After the coke was ignited, it
was allowed to burn slowly until
1:30 o'clock. During this time, if
it were not for suffocating fumes, a
person could have remained in the
furnace since almost all of the
heat produced was absorbed by the
iron.
Then the air blast was turned on
and myriads of sparks showered
out. When this operation has run
for JO or 12 minutes, the furnace
is tapped.
Meanwhile other preparations
had been made. Crucibles were ar
ranged on the floor and bars and
tonus brought ready for use. The
l plug was removed, and the cru
cibles filled with incandescent
metal. Student workers then filled
the molds from the portable cru
cibles.
The largev finished castings can
no! be taken from their molds until
today, when the green molding
sand will be removed and the cast
ings inspected for quality of work
manship.
