Here we have a contribution
from an ambitious co-ed who
chooses to sign the nom de plume
"Mary Gladys Stnilii" to her cry of
disgust:
Put little loving had I known
15< fore you p>issed within my ken;
I much preferred to be alone
Than in Hie company of men.
And then . . . YOU came! my heart
beat high.
Before, I liked love not one whit:
Now, having known your passion, I
Think even less of il!
Mary Gladys Smith.
