# DAILY BASEBALLERS CLASH WITH PRESS PLAYERS ON SUNDAY
## 
### 
A dense fog of secrecy permeated
the Daily baseball camp yesterday
as final preparations were being
made for the annual Daily-Press
diamond clash scheduled for id
o'clock Sunday morning Â«m the
varsity field.
The starting lineup is expected
to be released some time today, but
Gould is definitely slated to be at
third for the journalists, McGarr is
sure to be at short, and Humphreys
will probably do the catching.
There is also strong evidence that
Terwilliger and Whiteley will play
in the field.
No such uncertainty hangs over
the Press headquarters. Manager
Carl Schmidt announces the fol
lowing lineup, many of the players
being veterans of eight years back:
Mayrhofer p. Burrow c. I'rid lb,
0. Whilten 21). G. Whitten :!!>, Tull
ss, Hamlet If, Wilhelmy <112, and

lltner if. Bartholdy, Cross, Schmidt,
Warren, Storey, Wegner, Bartmess,
Ilipp, Peake, Malm, L. il. Whitten,
Heliums. Furbush. and Schrans are
available substitutes who may be
permitted to play if the score gets
too one-sided.
('. ,J. Williams of the Press offers
his annual purse to the first Press
player who swats a homer. Perhaps
lie will double it if the bases are
full.
The two teams finally agreed
upon an umpire, although several
other points have yet to be settled.
Carl Oliver will do the judging,
both at the plate and on the bases.
