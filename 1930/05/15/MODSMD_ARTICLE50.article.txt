# SOUTHERN TRACK STARS EXPECTED HERE TOMORROW
## Stanford, S.C., Doped To Take First Places In Collegiate Meet 
### 
Although no official word has as
vet been received, ii is expected
that trackmen representing South
ern California and U.C.L.A. in the
•California Intercollegiates, to he
held Saturday afternoon in tjie sta
dium, will arrive in Palo Alto to
morrow morning. The Trojan and
Bruit) spikesters will doubtless take
a light jvorkout tomorrow after
noon to ease the kinks out of their
muscles and acquaint themselves
with the Stanford oval. Coach Walt
Christie's California Hears will
probably not drive down from
Berkeley until Saturday morning.
Additional entrants from Stan
ford and U.C.L.A. raise the total
of competitors in the collegiate
meet to 112. Among these are to
be found three world's champions
Frank Wykoff, Eric Krenz, and
llarlow Rothert —and a horde of
near champions represented in
every event.
Judging from comparison of past
performances, Stanford and South
ern California should divide nearly
evenly• first places. Dope favors a
Cardinal to capture five points in
the 220. 440, shotput, discus, and
relay; the Trojans should grab the
100, 880, high hurdles, pole vault,
high jump, and broad jump; while
California's entrants look good for
firsts in the mile, 2-mile, low hur
dles, and javelin. These predictions
, are based on the assumption that
Johnny Morrison is in shape to j
run day after tomorrow. In the 1
event that the long-legged Redshirt
is unable to compete, Stanford will
definitely lose their first in the re
lay, and probably drop five more
points to the Trojans in the quarter- ,
mile.
Unless "Dink" Templeton's hoys
can pull more than one upset in 1
the battle for lirst places, Stanford
will be in for a bad afternoon, for
Dean Cromwell's stars are backed 1
up in nearly every event by a
strong supporting cast. Maurer,
Draper, and Guyer would be star ■
sprinters if VVykoff had never gone
to Southern. California; Halstead. j
McGeagh, and Burke stage battles
royal to decide which one wins the 1
SSD; Halstead and Hansen usually i
cross the mile finish within a cou
ple of yards of each other; Living
ston and Hubbard take turns win- j
ning the polo vault; as do Van
Odsel and Stewart in the high I
jump; and Welch, Payne, and Carls ;
form a hurdling combination that
is hard to beat.

evenly• first places. Dope favors a
Cardinal to capture five points in
the 220. 440, shotput, discus, and
relay; the Trojans should grab the
100, 880, high hurdles, pole vault,
high jump, and broad jump; while
California's entrants look good for
firsts in the mile, 2-mile, low hur
dles, and javelin. These predictions
, are based on the assumption that
Johnny Morrison is in shape to j
run day after tomorrow. In the 1
event that the long-legged Redshirt
is unable to compete, Stanford will
definitely lose their first in the re
lay, and probably drop five more
points to the Trojans in the quarter- ,
mile.
Unless "Dink" Templeton's hoys
can pull more than one upset in 1
the battle for lirst places, Stanford
will be in for a bad afternoon, for
Dean Cromwell's stars are backed 1
up in nearly every event by a
strong supporting cast. Maurer,
Draper, and Guyer would be star ■
sprinters if VVykoff had never gone
to Southern. California; Halstead. j
McGeagh, and Burke stage battles
royal to decide which one wins the 1
SSD; Halstead and Hansen usually i
cross the mile finish within a cou
ple of yards of each other; Living
ston and Hubbard take turns win- j
ning the polo vault; as do Van
Odsel and Stewart in the high I
jump; and Welch, Payne, and Carls ;
form a hurdling combination that
is hard to beat.
Although no official word has as
vet been received, ii is expected
that trackmen representing South
ern California and U.C.L.A. in the
•California Intercollegiates, to he
held Saturday afternoon in tjie sta
dium, will arrive in Palo Alto to
morrow morning. The Trojan and
Bruit) spikesters will doubtless take
a light jvorkout tomorrow after
noon to ease the kinks out of their
muscles and acquaint themselves
with the Stanford oval. Coach Walt
Christie's California Hears will
probably not drive down from
Berkeley until Saturday morning.
Additional entrants from Stan
ford and U.C.L.A. raise the total
of competitors in the collegiate
meet to 112. Among these are to
be found three world's champions
Frank Wykoff, Eric Krenz, and
llarlow Rothert —and a horde of
near champions represented in
every event.
Judging from comparison of past
performances, Stanford and South
ern California should divide nearly
evenly• first places. Dope favors a
Cardinal to capture five points in
the 220. 440, shotput, discus, and
relay; the Trojans should grab the
100, 880, high hurdles, pole vault,
high jump, and broad jump; while
