# BREAKERS LOSE TO TORO IN ONE-SIDED MURAL BALL GAME
## 
### 
Winning from Breakers by a
score of 21-12, the El Toro baseball
team moved into the final round of
the intramural baseball play yâ– 
terday. The game, a free-hitting
contest, went to the Bulls by virtue
of two big innings, the second and
sixth. Scoring seven runs in the
second and ten in the next to the
last inning, Toro piled up too big
a margin for the Breakers to over
come.
Puthoff, second baseman of the
Bulls, was the star of the game.
Besides turning in a circus catch
of an infield fly, he secured four
hits in five trips to the plate, one
of his blows being good for a home
run.
Hubbard pitched steady ball for
the winners, allowing but nine bits
and fanning ten men, while New
be-in of Breakers whiffed seven
men, although lie was hit hard and
often. Pox, getting three hits in
four times at bat, was the slugger
of the losing team.
Fisher of Toro featured the sev
enth inning with a lusty blow to
right field to tour the bases only
to be put out ;it home when Hunk,
husky Breakers' catcher, hid the
plate until lie could find the ball.
Poor base-running accounted lor
the smallness of the score, Toro in
particular having three men nippe<J
off third base.
Sequoia I will meet El Toro next
Monday afternoon on the varsity
diamond in the final game of the
season. The hall team entered the
final round of play by-defeating the
Phi Sigs hist Monday in the other
semi-final game of the mural sea
son.
