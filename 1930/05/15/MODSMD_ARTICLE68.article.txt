Has anyone forty-live dollais?
The Delta Chi's are selling the
family jewelry to pay oil the mort
gage.
Yesterday morning .students ap
proaching the library were de
tracted from studious pursuits by
a 1915 model Pieree-Arrow bearing
a large white price-mark on its
windshield. No salesman was pres
ent; further details were printed
on a sheet of notebook paper which
flapped in the wind. The advertise
ment stated that a $10,000 liability
policy was included, and suggested
that those interested call the
Pierce-Arrow Exchange at the Delta
Chi house.
Besides its triple ignition and
speed of 70 ni.h.p., the venerable
bus was found to contain one extra
tire (dissected), two pairs of over
alls (one blue, one tan, to suit the
buyer's taste), one 1!)2!> Quad,-and
a pair of shoes.
