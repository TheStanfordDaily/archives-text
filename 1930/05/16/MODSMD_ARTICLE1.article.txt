Bonfire Vote
The bonfire vote is to represent j
an advisory opinion on the part of i
the students to the Executive Com-!
mittee. It will not have any direct |
effect on the situation in itself.
Hobert IVI. Clarke, chairman of j
Ihe election board, urges that spe- j
oial attention be paid to carrying I
out the printed instructions on the |
ballots. All ballots should be !
marked in ink, not pencil, and the j
mark should be in the form of a j
cross (X). Failure to comply with!
these instructions will result in the j
invalidation of the ballots.
Don Colvin, A.S.S.U. presidential j
nominee, in a public announcement '
in the Daily yesterday, requested :
that his friends give their support j
to one of the other candidates, as j
his nomination had not been dei
sired on his part.
The count will be made in the '
Political Science Building immedi- j
ately following the election. It will j
be open to anyone wishing to watch j
it, according to Clarke.
