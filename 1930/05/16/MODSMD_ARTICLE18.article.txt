# POLICE BESIEGE INDIAN REBELS
## Waiting Contest Staged In Passive Resistance 
### 
.BOMBAY, May 15. (/P)â€”The eyes j
j of all India centered today on the |
| little village of Dhara.saana, where!
j the strangest scene of all the extra- j
! ordinary drama witnessed recently j
I in this country was enacted.
A contest in "civil resistance" j
j took place; between Mrs. Sarojini j
I Naidu, heading a group defying the j
| salt laws, and police. Mrs. Naidu, j
I who heads the civil disobedience j
j movement now that Mahatma |
Gandhi and Abbas Tyabji are in '
jail, headed her volunteers for the)
' government salt deposits at Dhar- j
asaana intending to raid the salt i
pans.
The police halted the party, l
j whereupon Mrs. Naidu and her fol-!
I lowers squatted un the road while I
: the police formed a cordon around j
; them. The odd situation continued }
! all day. No one was allowed to
; pass the cordon with food for'the
j volunteers, and no volunteer who
! left the police lines was permitted
| to return. *
Meanwhile, the woman leader
! and her flock sat in the road, chat
! ting and spinning native cloth. It
| was believed that she would be
; joined by a second party tomorrow
' unless she agreed to leave Dhar
| asaana road. The usual crop of ar
! rests and sentences was harvested,
but there were no serious dis
j orders.
