# JUNIOR OPERA IS NEAR RUIN AFTER WOODLAND FORAY
## 
### 
Stark tragedy stalking
through comedy scenes . . .
a dread malady mysteriously
incapacitating members of the
cast . . . the Junior Opera in
evitably postponed . . . the
climax of Junior Week hist
. . . and all because the stage
crew for Saturday's stage pre
sentation almost stole the
show.
Directed to forage for shrub
bery to decorate the stage for
the Junior Opera, a number
of the stage hands departed
for the hills only to return
with armloads of the Stan
ford scourgeâ€”poison oak.
"Oh, but we were told that
poison oak never grows higher
than two feet," came the
chorus of protests when the
news of the mistake was
bruited about. "We measured
this, and it was 39 inches
high."
