## Morrison Definitely Out Of Running; Brown Is Also On Injured List Dyer, Wykoff Meet Again; Smith Faces Pogolotti And Welch in Hurdles 
### Bob Van Etten 
All roads lead to Stanford Stadium
tomorrow afternoon as the curtain
rises at 1:45 on the California Inter
collcgiates, expected to he the piece
ile -resistance set before track fans of
the Pacific Coast thi-i year.
I hirty-six Trojans and 19 liruins,
with their coaches, managers, and
trainers, will climb off the the train al
l'alo Alto this morning. The southern
horde is expected to devote some part
of today to familiarizing themselves
with the Stanford oval and to indulge
in light workouts.
Morrison Out
(hauces of a Cardinal victory, al
ready slim enough, are flickering very
feebly with the definite announcement
that Johnny Morrison, 4-40 ace, will
not run tomorrow. Morrison is un
der orders from Dr. F. Roth, team
physician, to take things easily until
the 1.C.4-A. meet.
With Morrison out, it will be lip
to Ike Hablcs or Mayuor Shove to
come through to beat Williams of
Southern California, and keep Stan
ford's 440-record clear. As far as
the relay is concerned, that can prac
tically be awarded to the Trojans.
Besides Morrison, Bob Brown may
be on the absentee list.
Dyer Meets Wykoff
Aside from the bitter competition
between Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia squads, the burning question to
be decided in tomorrow's contest i>:
Can lice Dyer repeat his 100-yard
dash victory over Frank Wykoff, re
cent claimant of the world's century
record?
Hec is a competitive athlete, how
ever, and the Trojan sprinter's world's
record is not bothering him in the
least. The usual gale blowing down
the straightaway is a matter to be con
sidcrcd as well, and although Wykoti
may battle the breeze successfully in
the short race, Dyer's greater strength
may well be the determining factor in
the 220.
The quality of competition in the
dashes is typical of practically every
event on the program. Only three con
sistent first place winners appear cer
tain to retain their laurels. Bother!
and Krenz, of course, arc capable of
taking the shot and discus respec
tively from anyone on the coast, while
Van Odsel, although inclined to be
inconsistent, appears definitely the
class of the high jumpers.
Smith in Battles
In the rest of the events, picking a
winner is in the class of selecting a
lottery number. Dowel!, West, and
Butler will renew their blood feud in
the broad jump with Paul and Bar
ber of U.S.C. Podge Smith finds a
pair of battles on his hands in the
hurdles against I'ogolotti of Califor
nia, Welch, Payne, Carls, and Stokes
of Southern California.
California furnishes the Trojans
with fancy competition in three events.
Curtice and Churchill will seek re
venge on M. or ten son in the javelin,
with an excellent chance of getting
their man. If "Spud" Moss man re
peats his iron man stunt to run both
mile and two-mile, he will furnish
Halstcad, llfrtisen, Fitzinauricc, and
Daniels plenty of food for thought.
