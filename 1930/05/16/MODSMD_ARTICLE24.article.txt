# CLOUDED ISSUES

( )nce upon ;i time there was a college editor.
This young fellow had very set ideas concerning the preroga- '
lives of the press; he found it hard to understand the devious men
tal paths of persons who shunned reporters and abhorred having
their names in tlx* paper.
Today this editorial stripling is finding out how it feels to place i
someone else's shoe on his own foot. I lis fair name is heing tossed
lightly from copy desk to copy desk; from front page to front page.
And now an appreciation of the feelings of those tender, pub
licity-shy individuals is beginning to sink into an ink-clogged brain. 1
It is much nicer to put other people's names on front pages than it i
is to have one's own in that identical position. I'lit this would-be

This sudden keener appreciation of tender skins and finer sensi
bilities came to pass because the youthful editor printed an editorial. ;
The text of this editorial was taken from the syllabus of an engi- 1
neering course given in the University. The issue raised was an old
one—that of peace versus militarism.
The Daily does not intend at this time to go into the ramifica
tions of this question again. The Daily's stand has been set down 1
more than once, it is not necessary to reiterate it at this time.
The matter of peace and militarism has become secondary, any
how. The real issue is one of the editor's right to utilize material I
on a syllabus sheet without the permission of its author. It is !
charged that such use was a violation of an unwritten academic j
custom.
The editor takes this opportunity to express his own stand. |
11 is so-called violation was committed in good faith, because he j
believes that the "unwritten understanding" covers only classroom 1
lectures. There is a difference between the spoken word of a j
lecture and the written word of a syllabus sehet. The rule (ac
cording to the editor's understanding fit" it ) protects the professor
from being quoted on something he might say in the heat of a
lecture that does not adequately reflect his stand. There obviously
would be little heat in a syllabus which has been in print for j
several years.
The editor is not alone in his interpretation of this stand. lie !
has found a similar interpretation in the faculty of this University. j
and he discovered unanimous agreement among newspaper men and j
women on the campus and in I'alo Alto—men and women who have '
worked under this rule for several years.
Whatever the outcome of tin's furore, the editor feels that good'
faith inspired his action.

( )nce upon ;i time there was a college editor.
This young fellow had very set ideas concerning the preroga- '
lives of the press; he found it hard to understand the devious men
tal paths of persons who shunned reporters and abhorred having
their names in tlx* paper.
Today this editorial stripling is finding out how it feels to place i
someone else's shoe on his own foot. I lis fair name is heing tossed
lightly from copy desk to copy desk; from front page to front page.
And now an appreciation of the feelings of those tender, pub
licity-shy individuals is beginning to sink into an ink-clogged brain. 1

This sudden keener appreciation of tender skins and finer sensi
bilities came to pass because the youthful editor printed an editorial. ;
The text of this editorial was taken from the syllabus of an engi- 1
neering course given in the University. The issue raised was an old
one—that of peace versus militarism.
The Daily does not intend at this time to go into the ramifica
tions of this question again. The Daily's stand has been set down 1
more than once, it is not necessary to reiterate it at this time.
The matter of peace and militarism has become secondary, any
how. The real issue is one of the editor's right to utilize material I
on a syllabus sheet without the permission of its author. It is !
charged that such use was a violation of an unwritten academic j
custom.
The editor takes this opportunity to express his own stand. |
11 is so-called violation was committed in good faith, because he j
believes that the "unwritten understanding" covers only classroom 1
lectures. There is a difference between the spoken word of a j
lecture and the written word of a syllabus sehet. The rule (ac
cording to the editor's understanding fit" it ) protects the professor
from being quoted on something he might say in the heat of a
lecture that does not adequately reflect his stand. There obviously
would be little heat in a syllabus which has been in print for j
several years.
The editor is not alone in his interpretation of this stand. lie !
has found a similar interpretation in the faculty of this University. j
and he discovered unanimous agreement among newspaper men and j
women on the campus and in I'alo Alto—men and women who have '
worked under this rule for several years.
Whatever the outcome of tin's furore, the editor feels that good'
faith inspired his action.
