I "liable lo be longer even technically a party to the jingo doc-'
1 fines of the parent organization, twelve local members of the
Daughters of the American Revolution society yesterday tendered!
their resignations.
All twelve of these women, wives of Stanford faculty men or
in some way connected with the I'niversity, are persons of intclli ,
gence and discrimination. Their action cannot be constructed as j
bastv or ill-advised. It is simply the inevitable protest against a I
scries of saber-rattling utterances of D.A.R. officials.
hollowing is a part of the official protest filed with the national
organization:
"We. the undersigned, members of the Palo Alto Chapter of
Stanford I'niversity, Daughters of the American Revolution, de-!
ploring the political activities and the reactionary policies of the I
National Hoard in regard to I'eace, Disarmament, and the World'
Court; protesting against the high-handed methods of administra- '
lion bv which the member chapters have no effective voice in the
determination of the national policies of the Association: and real- i
i/.ing, after two vears of effort, the futility of the hope that any !
material change ma}' be brought about within the organization . . ."
The Daii.v congratulates these women on their stand. Such ac
tion is entirely justified and entirely commendable.
Other dissenting members of the D.A.R. would do well to take
the above words as a text for similar action. Operating with its!
original purpose, the Daughters of the American Revolution was
probably an estimable organization. I Jut in recent years it has be- !
come the citadel of penny patriotism and the rankest type of jingo
ism.
Doubtless there are thousands of other women in the body who
are of the same mind as these local individuals who have withdrawn. 1
These will do well to follow the trail blazed by these Stanford
leaders.
()nly by some such drastic action will the great organization be |
purged of its destructive aims, and made into the constructive
agrncv which it should be.
