The following statement was issued to the press last night by
Dr. Robert E. Swain, acting president of the I'niversity:
"This whole situation is to lit- regretted for two reasons. One
is the method of it. An able and highly esteemed member of the
faculty of this L'niversitv finds himself called on the long-distance
telephone about dinner time by a representative of the press in
San Francisco to listen to sentences from a mimeographed skeleton
outline of lectures given in a course in the principles of mining.
These were reported to the press from the office of the campus
paper as the subject of editorial criticism in the forthcoming issue
of that paper. He at once became the subject of nation-wide pub
licity without being given the courtesy of an interview before the
excerpts were released.
"The other is that this is a violation of the freedom and the
spirit of the classroom. The greatest teachers are those who provoke
students to the thoughtful consideration of important issues. They
present propositions for thoughtful debate and study which are not
final declarations of opinion.
Stripped from the spirit and substance of the whole presentation
isolated sentences take an unwarranted prominence and may be
positively misleading. The work of the university classroom should
be kept free from this type of public criticism.
