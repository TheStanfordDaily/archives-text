With Stanford talent well repre
sented, Paul Bissinger's very inti
mate revue greeted first-night audi
ences Wednesday at the Erlanger
Columbia, with its New Yorker fla
vor and sophisticated theme.
The production, in its world pre
mier, started off in a whirlwind
tempo in the first net that was im
possible to keep up after the inter
mission. Difficulty in stage settings
and a poor spot here and there im
paired the second act, which will
undoubtedly be smoothed out soon.
Ken Murray and Odette Myrtil
proved their Broadway reputations
in the many skits and musical num
bers in which they were featured.
Lester Vail. Teddy Walters, Billy
Griffith, and Frank Beaston, all
troupers of the first rank, added
much to tiie cast. Alexander Left
wich's deft touches were evident,
in true Gotham style, and his wife
was responsible for the excellent
costuming throughout the produc
tion.
Many skits, most of them verging
on the "daring," were thickly inter
spersed among musical sketches,
chorus routings, and before-the
curtain bantering by the highly
amusing Ken Murray. Odette Myr
til* s voice and violin playing, added
to a great personal charm, made
her the star of the evening.
In the cast, musical score, de
signing and writing of "Hi-There,"
the Stanford touch is seen. Paul
Speegle in various small parts does
extremely well; .Jack Wiggin's
music is played in many sketches,
with the clever lyrics written by
Greg Williamson; "Dream Music"
by Griff Williams is the featured
tune of the show; Harold Helven
ston's sets are in evidence; Wil
liams and Neal Spaulding offer
piano duets, both on the stage and
in the mezzanine lobby during the
intermission; and there are lyrics
by Tom Breeze.
Skits by Clark and McCollough,
Kathleen Morris and Alexander
Leftwich are played. Best tunes in
the show are "Dream Music," Ralph
Rainger's "No One But the Righl
Man Can Do Me Wrong," Jack Wig
gin's "Do a Hallelujah," and our
choice for first place, "You Mug,
You're Marvelous," hy Herb Magid
son, Ned Washington, and Michael
Cleary, known as composers of
"Singing in the Bathtub" and
of hers.

| The opening night followed one
of the most concentrated rehearsals
of recent San Francisco produc
tions. Many in the company did not
leave (lie theatre for sixty hours
before the curtain rose Wednesday.
"Mi-There" is hooked for four weeks
at the Columbia and is then slated
to go to Los Angeles before mov
ing to New York. —J. T.
THE FOOLS' PARADE. Stories
by John W. Vandercook. Har
pers, New York. 1930. At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.
The author of "Black Majesty"
has published another volume. But
to one who thought "Black Maj
lesty" a great book, Vandercook's
latest, -"The Fools' Parade," will
prove disappointing, ft is a good
book.
Vandercook's forte is not the
i short story. However, this volume
of six stories is acceptable, even
from the writer of "Black Majesty."
These six tales are more concerned
with atmosphere than with plot,
with theme than with character.
That attitude seems to be inevita
ble in stores of dark Africa.
The Africa of this volume seems
to be authentic. It is the beautiful,
j ruthless Africa of travelers' tales.
Ii has the tropical inevitability of
Somerset Maugham's descriptions.
There are bits like this which ap
peal to the imagination and the
knowledge of men:
"At bedtime I stepped out to see
the moon. It was just above tiie
black mass, of the jungle. By its
faint light 1 saw Karnga. The night
was vibrant with the shrill, high
rhythms of the insects and he did
not hear me. He Avas standing at
the edge of the clearing facing the
'wall of the forest. I watched. His
1 hands lifted slowly till his arms
were high above his head. The
fingers were stretched upward,
suppliant. They moved with grop
ing yearning as if to feel out some
shape and comfort from the
night. ... So at, other times had
I seen men of the far woods ap
proach familiar gods on nights
when the moon was new . . ."
The charm and the mystery of
, the dark continent struggle through
the pages of "The Fools' Parade."
Startling black and white drawings
by Mahlon Blaine help in the strug
t gle. —J. R.
