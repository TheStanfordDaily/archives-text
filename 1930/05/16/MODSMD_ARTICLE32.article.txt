VILLANELI.E
Denouncing the Villanelle
I don't like the villanelle,
With its oft-repeated lines;
Repetition sounds like hell.
Furthermore, it does not sell;
He who sells not never dines;
I don't like tlie villanelle.
Any poet might as well
Draw linoleum designs;
Repetition sounds like hell.
Surely anyone can tell
What the simplest fool divines: ,
I don't like the villanelle.
If you're wanting something swell,
Sweet, but strong, like good old
wines,
Repetition sounds like hell.
. .
Like a clanking, rusty bell
Ring its oft-repeated lines,
"I don't like the villanelle,"
"Repetition sounds like hell"!
