# DAILY NINE MEETS PRESS IN ANNUAL TILT HERE SUNDAY
## Pressmen Out For Seventh Victory; Ink-Slingers Resting For Fray 
### H. M 
Amid I lie expected tumultuous
cheering of the expected assembled
multitudes, the journalists and
typesetters will meet on the varsity
diamond promptly at 10 o'clock
Sunday morning in the seventh an
nual Daily-Press baseball classic.
To dale the Press lias won all six
of the contests, but the campus
pen-pushers a I*9 out for revenge.
While the Daily ball artists have
been resting up for the big tussle,
the Press men have been busy
practicing. Carl Schmidt, manager
of the back-room gang, lias been
looking over his men and finds
them in excellent condition.
Denying the report that all um
pires in previous encounters have
always been lynched before the
day's festivities ended, Carl Oliver,
arbiter of Sunday's struggle, was
heard smacking bis 1 ips with gusto
yesterday in anticipation of start
ing a few brawls between the par
ticipants.
Walks, miscues, and home-runs
make all Daily-Press games inter
esting, from the standpoint of the
storekeeper, at least. Last year
AlcGarr of the newspaper outfit hit
a hot liner to the infield and came
all the way around on three bad
throws.
