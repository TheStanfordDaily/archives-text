THE BEAR GROWLS
At the end of 40 minutes of
vigorous football on a warm after
noon last fall a group of more
surprised than pleased pigskin
packers walked off the Stanford
field wondering just what had giv<'ti
them the impression that li»2!» was
the year in which to down the
Cardinals.
Shortly after this conclusion of
the festivities one Mr. Claivnee
"Nibs" Price, known in sporting
circles as a better than average
golfer, uttered those immortal
words which are emblazoned on the
heart of every loyal Californian:
"Wait until next year!"
This sentiment crystallized into
a more definite idea, best described
as a "Beat Stanford" fixation, al
though certain of the more rabid
Berkeleyites slightly altered the
slogan so that it read "Hate Stan
ford!" —obviously a more virile
caUthword, and one possessing the
merit of being somewhat easier to
effect.
Heavy Practice
It is this "Beat Stanford" ideal
that Mr. Price has been .drumming
into the heads of his icemen dur
ing what has been described by
northern correspondents' as the
most intensive spring practice ever
held on the Berkeley campus.
While recognizing the nobility
of thought and worthiness of pur
pose behind Mr. Price's intentions,
it is nevertheless reasonable to
speculate slightly as to just how
the California mentor will realize
his ambition. Several large-sized
pairs of shoes were left to be filled
by the recent graduation proceed
ings at Berkeley, notably those once
worn by "Bennah" Lom, his com
patriot, Slippery Lee Eisan, and
Brick Morse's All-American Roy
lliegels, notorious key man of the
Blue and Gold spontaneous reverse
plays. It our pet. opinion that
the versatile efforts of Mr. Lom
are going to be sadly missed by
the Golden Bears before the 1930
season is very far under way.
Price Optimistic
However, undeterred by the loss
of Lom, Eisan, Riegels, Barr,
Schwartz, Norton, Gil!. Pitto, and
various lesser lights, Mr. Price is
optimistic and determined. In fact
Mr. Price announces that Califor
nia's famous plays, numbers 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5, first developed by Coach
Andy Smith three weeks after tho
Battle of Gettysburg, are going to
be laid gently hack among the

mothballs, and that the California
varsity will blossom out next fall
with a new and novel repertoire of
startling formations.
This is welcome news, at least
for the spectators. No one can for
get the highly original "button, but
ton, who's got the button" pluy de
vised by Mr. Price last year and
sprung Upon a startled multitude
ill the Big Came. As we recall it,
the quarterback received the ball,
handed it to the fullback, who gave
it to the left guard, who rammed
it into the stomach of the water
boy, who presented ii to the head
linesman. The next play called for
a punt from behind the goal line.
However, ii is perhaps a little
early to award the Big Game to
Stanford. The California boys can
at times play football. If you don't
believe us, ask Howard Jones.
