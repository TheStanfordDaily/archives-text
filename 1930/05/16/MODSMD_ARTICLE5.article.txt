# SPAULDING ELECTED HALL VICE-PRESIDENT
## 
### 
Catherine Spauiding was elected
vice-president of Roble and Helen
FJisner sophomore member of
House Committee in yesterday's
revote.
Due to an error in the original
ballot the votes for sophomore
member of Committee of Five were
not counted, so the first legal vote
for that office was taken yesterday.
Margaret McDougall and Betty
Lawton led the five candidates and
a revote will be held between them
today.
