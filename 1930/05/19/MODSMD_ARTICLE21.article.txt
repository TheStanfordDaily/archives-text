# LUCK STATES LEGAL ASPECT OF MOONEY-BILLINGS IMPRISONMENT
## 
### BY ELIZABETH PAINE 
1 "According to the legal axiom
that 'a tuan is innocent unless
proven guilty by fair anil Impartial
! trial,' two innocent men have been
I in California prisons for fourteen
I years" is the statement of I'rofes
j sot' Luck of the Chemistry Deparl
' inent in an interview yesterday for
■the Daily. Professor Luck aecotn-
I panied a delegation of Friends
j which interviewed Governor Young
recently on the imprisonment of
Thomas Mooney and Warren Bil
; lings, in addition lie has talked
! with both Mooney and Billings and
I has reviewed the case for tho
'"Friends Intelligencer" of Phila-
I dolphin.
"The two men were charged with
I the setting of a bomb which killed
I en people fluting the Preparedness
j I'ay parade in San Francisco in
: Ift 1(5," continued Dr. Luck. "Con
jvictions were secured on testimony
j which later investigation proved to
j be of dubious worth. That there had
been an unfortunate miscarriage of
■justice soon became evident. In
i view of the perjury committed by
| the principal witnesses for the
prosecution as much presumption
i of innocence now attaches to the
| two men as though they had never
been tried.
"The salient arguments advanced

1 by l lie advocates of pardon arc. tlie
proven perjury of Oxiuan and Mc-
Donald, without, whose damaging
lestiuiony convictions would never
have been secured; the disrepute
and dubious characters of the re
maining witnesses; anrl the fact
that people intimately connected
with the trials are convinced on
flu- basis of subsequent evidence
that Ihe guilt of Mooney and Bil
lings has not been proven. Among
the latter are Judge Griffin, wiio
tried Mooney, James Brennan, who
as assistant district attorney prose
cuted Billings, tlie captain of de
tectives, the chief of police, and
the foreman and all surviving
i members of the jury.
"A federal mediation commis
sion, appointed by President Wil
son in l»16, containing in its per
sonnet several distinguished jnr
ists. reported in part as follows:
'When Oxman was discredited, the
verdict against Mooney was dis
credited,' In I!>U7 President Emeri
tus David Starr Jordan wrote in
reference lo the case. 'As matters
stand the State of California is nn
trial.l>r. Luck pointed out that
the pardoning power is vested in
Hie Governor, in whom all hopes
of clemency for Mooney and Bil-
I lings now rest.
