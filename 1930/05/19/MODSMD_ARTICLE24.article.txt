# WHY FIVE HUNDRED?

### 
I lie fair white hands of the feminine members of ihe Daily
stafl have become smeared with printer's ink in preparing the 1
Women's Edition for the campus this morning.
Ihe young minds o! the feminine journalists have, been puzzled .
long and deeply over the many and difficult problems besetting l
Stanford women.
hirst, thero is the present lockout agitation which has brought
new demands for non-regulation of uppcrclass co-eds. The report'
of the A.W.S. Conference committee will be, if approved, a far
slep toward the ultimate social freedom the women are striving for.
Second, there is the \\ omen's < ivm. ()r perhaps more appro- 1
priate would be, where is the Women's (ivm? All during the year
we have peeked out the Daily window to see the breaking of the i
ground. And what has happened? Nothing. The first week of
May has passed with no activity. The first week of June and July ,
will no doubt pass with the same dreariness and monotony of wait- ,
iug. Waiting and waiting and waiting for thirty-nine years.
'I hird, there is the traditional attitude toward Stanford women.

L. A. s lemininity are lovely creatures, but Stanford women have
high IQ's. There is a deep-rooted ancient prejudice against the Five ;
Hundred, and although there are always exceptions—that doesn't
help the rule. Not a whit.
For four years the hive I lundrcd problem has bothered us. Now
we have come to a momentous conclusion.
The source of ;ill the evil is the 50(1 limit.
A curious history is connected with the evolution of the hive!
When I .eland Stanford and his wife signed the founding grant
on Xovembcr 11, 1885, ii was to create a "t Diversity feir both l
sexes."
Number 16 of Section 4 reads: "To afford equal facilities and
give equal advantages in llu 1 I'niversity to both the sexes."
Thus Stanford was started on her road to strength and fame j
with coeducation a firm principle of the founding.
That Senator Stanford believed the winds of freedom should i
blow em all students alike is evident from his first address to the
Trustees. "We deem it of the first importance," said lie, "that the
education of both sexes shall he equally full and complete, varied
only as nature dictates. The rights of one sex, political or other
wise, are the same as those of the other sex." j
In Stanford's first year there were 3XO men and 110 women. ]5y
1X99 there were 6')o men and 463 women. This rapid expansion,
of the women students alarmed Mrs. Stanford and on May 31,'
1X99, she declared:
"Whereas the I'niversity was founded in memory of our dear;
son Lelanel. and bears his name, I direct, under the powers given |
me in the (Jriginal (irant. lliat the number of women attending the !
I'niversity as students shall at no time exceed five hundred."
Thus began the now famous or infamous l ive Hundred—the
object of many a bullsession and many a girl's assiduous striving in !
high school.
It was not until F)O5 that there were actually 500 women, and
then began the now historic entrance requirements. The piles of j
red tape amassed in the selection of Stanford women would wind
a Cardinal strand round the world several thousand times. Per-!
sonally, we've always been convinced that numbers were taken out
of a hat —but the strictness of entrance requirements has served to
give the world the impression that Stanford women are mental gen
iuses—while really their average IO is but 2.6 points higher than >
that of the men.
Since PK)S Stanford has had lop-sided coeducation, a double
standard, and discrimination against the hive Hundred. The chang
ing status of the lower division is proving another feminine disad- ;
vantage as in the new order of things human, more and more women j
will be entering advanced fields. Ilut only 500 will enter Stanford.
It is useless to cry tei the high heavens that the 500 limit be
abolished.
It is bound in iron and lined with steel and immovably placed in i
the founding grant. Competent lawyers have declared change im
possible. I hit as competent lawyers they have suggested a way to :
get around the limit. The answer to the hive 1 kindred's problems i
lies in this suggestion.
"The only way there can be an increase in the number eif
women," said Dr. Wilbur," would be by the establishment of a!
separate endowment for the education of women, with some leas- 1
ing arrangements for the use of the campus and other facilities of j
ihe I'niversity."
Ibis is the legitimate proposal to alleviate the present lop-sided 1
coeducation.
Stanford women need a savior with about ten million dollars —a
mythical Mrs. Darkness who will prove the godmother of the hive
Hundred and put a Twenty before the figure.
The new day r»f Stanford women lies in the vast unknown fu- j
ture. Cntil that day Stanford women will fight against inequality i
and the ancient prejudice of Stanford men. They will wait for the ;
<ivm. struggle for lockout revision—and live in the hope that the j
new day will bring a series of new quadrangles over which the
winds of freedom may blow unhindered from the red roofs of F.n- 1
cina over the cloistered Ouad to the women.
