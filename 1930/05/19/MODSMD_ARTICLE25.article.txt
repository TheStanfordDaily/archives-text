# HANDS OFF THE EDITOR

### 
When adventure stalks right into the Daily office in the person I
of a mysterious "Mr. W'atkins," self-styled reporter of the F.xam
iiirr, such deeds of daring as followed last Thursday night cannot j
go unnoticed—even in the W omen's Edition.
"Mr. W'atkins" wanted to take the editor for a rifle. As ac- j
complices in this design, there were many odd-looking characters
masquerading as rambling wrecks of poverty hovering about the j
Daily.
Warning of the suspicious characters lurking in the Corporation
Yard* came so when "Mr. W'atkins" actually appeared at the office

there was an excited crowd of journalists, campus police officials,
and professors waiting for him.
Ihe mysterious stranger lit off into the night. There followed
a wild chase up and down the highway from midnight to dawn.
After frantic phone calls to Sacramento, third-degree grillings until
4 a.m. and sleuthing equal to Philo Vance, the whole affair was
found to he—just a little joke.
The editor was to he ducked in the lake as a lesson to his
editorial audacity.
The "little joke." leaking into the national press as it did, lias
become a v.ery serious thing. It is a reversion of the old days of
hazing at Stanford and high-school pranks.
The complete failure of the scheme surely shows that playing
with a certain strong-arm crew of campus journalists is like toying
with dynamite. And although Mr. Speers may he a pacifist, he can
he militant about it.
\nvwav, he doesn't like cold water .'it three in the morning.
