THE FIRST MRS. ERASER. By,
St. John Ervine. The Macmil- '
lan Company, New York, 1930
St. John Krvinc, best known for his >
"John Ferguson" has added yet another
play to his already lung list with "The
First Mrs. Fraser," a three-act com
edy revolving around Janet Fraser's I
resourcefulness in maintaining her in- j
dependence.
In Janet Fraser, "the first Mrs. Fra
ser," Ervine has created a vigorous, '
charming character that he himself |
describes thus: "She is a woman of
character and decision, not intellec- i
tual in the sense that she is familiar
with the cliches of cliques, hut very 1
intelligent. She has dignity and judg- '
ment, and there is laughter in her eyes.!
Janet is a thoroughly nice woman, j
Fveryone wonders why James left her. j
So, sometimes, does James." i
She comes and goes among her self- j
centered, good-looking, ex - husband |
James; the hard Elsie, the "second i
Mrs. Fraser"; loyal, devoted, wise- ;
cracking Oxonian son Ninian; senti- i
mental, stodgy son Murdo and his
wife; bachelor lover Philip Logan. I
Serene, with a humor of her own j
and not Frvine's, she is charming in I
the finesse with which sin- refuses to I
he bullied or flattered into accepting ;
again the man who has divorced her. :
There is sufficient tea drinking and 1
that quiet, unobtrusive humor to make |
the play unmistakably English. Ii j
brings no guffaws but leaves one with ;
the snappy, contented feeling of late |
Indian summer days. One is proud j
and amused with Janet at her clever- j

iit'ss. Humorous self-satisfaction ron
' tiiiut'S after the book i-> closed.
—B. L. B.
THE TEXAN—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
The red-blooded Westerner,
i namely Gary Cooper, the Texan, is
i now picturesquely .set in a Spanish
Hacienda in South America, with
Fay Winy to help matters along.
The picture is not unusual with
its oft-repeated hell-for-leatlier pur
-1 suits an dhigh-lension gun-fights,
: but somehow or other it still man
ages to produce several thrdls.
The story is that of the reform
' of a bad man, the Texan "Llano
; Kid," under the gentle influence
! of his mother and the girl, who is
j supposedly his cousin. Complica
tions arise when Gary is sent to
l
! South America where his mother
I is amassing a fortune for her long
! missing sou; Gary having been sent
to annex the aforementioned for-
II une.
Both Gary Cooper and Fay Wray
are well suited to their roles and
! accomplish a very acceptable piece
j of acting. Fay is indeed charming
as the Spanish senorita.
The action, adapted from one of
|0. Henry's tales, is inclined to he
j as slow as the beautiful but sleepy
j setting, although occasionally bits
!of the original author's humor
; flicker through. As a whole it is a
j good few hours' amusement.

THE FIRST MRS. ERASER. By,
St. John Ervine. The Macmil- '
lan Company, New York, 1930
St. John Krvinc, best known for his >
"John Ferguson" has added yet another
play to his already lung list with "The
First Mrs. Fraser," a three-act com
edy revolving around Janet Fraser's I
resourcefulness in maintaining her in- j
dependence.
In Janet Fraser, "the first Mrs. Fra
ser," Ervine has created a vigorous, '
charming character that he himself |
describes thus: "She is a woman of
character and decision, not intellec- i
tual in the sense that she is familiar
with the cliches of cliques, hut very 1
intelligent. She has dignity and judg- '
ment, and there is laughter in her eyes.!
Janet is a thoroughly nice woman, j
Fveryone wonders why James left her. j
So, sometimes, does James." i
She comes and goes among her self- j
centered, good-looking, ex - husband |
James; the hard Elsie, the "second i
Mrs. Fraser"; loyal, devoted, wise- ;
cracking Oxonian son Ninian; senti- i
mental, stodgy son Murdo and his
wife; bachelor lover Philip Logan. I
Serene, with a humor of her own j
and not Frvine's, she is charming in I
the finesse with which sin- refuses to I
he bullied or flattered into accepting ;
again the man who has divorced her. :
There is sufficient tea drinking and 1
that quiet, unobtrusive humor to make |
the play unmistakably English. Ii j
brings no guffaws but leaves one with ;
the snappy, contented feeling of late |
Indian summer days. One is proud j
and amused with Janet at her clever- j

iit'ss. Humorous self-satisfaction ron
' tiiiut'S after the book i-> closed.
