HATE IMPORTS!

"Put Stanford for her men."
Thus terminates one of the songs 1
which the Stanford co-eds sing lustily
between courses at dinner. Put these
long praised men of the Farm, with 1
their erstwhile magnetism for their
feminine classmates, are swiftly be- ;
coming things of the past.
It is often heard that "imports" are
the pet dates of the Stanford men.
The reason for this is very obvious. ;
Sour grajtes! Of the .1000 men, how
many can rate one of the "500"? Low
queening records are often alibied by
the old stall of preferring "imports."
The trite saying "four out of live I
have 'It.' The fifth goes to Stanford," !
is counteracted by the opinion of one |
popular co-ed: "Four out of five men
are conceited. All four go to Stan
ford."
After interviewing a dozen of the
most popular Stanford women, 1 /

1 found the following objections to our
i men predominating:
Tliev are as scarce as hen's teeth.
They average live feet and three
inches in height.
They are continually praising the
| girls from home, the girls from Mills,
and the girls from Cal.
They should read Kmily Post and
"get wise" to the following:
1. Send corsages for formals.
j 2. It is impolite to flaunt other
women.
3. Punctuality is a thing to he de
sired in the masculine sex.
4. Unshaved faces and uncombed
! hair are never attractive.
Most of them should take "Five
Rasy Lessons" and learn to dance.
If Helen Morgan were a Stanford
co-ed, she would sing with feeling:
"If I Could Find Him, the Right
Kind of Man."
â€”"F.xperienced in T.ove."
