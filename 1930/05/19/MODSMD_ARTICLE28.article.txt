# HISTORY OF FIVE HUNDRED LIMIT FOUND IN JORDAN WRITINGS, OLD PUBLICATIONS

### 
That t lie presence of women
tended to decrease school spirit
was one of the reasons given for
the 500 limit which Mrs. Lelaml
Stanford placed on the woifion stu
dents on May 31, 1899.
Among the students in the first,
years, according to Dr. Jordan, the
presence of the women was taken
for granted. Then disapproval w-as
voiced. "One critical group," says
the Chancellor Emeritus in the
"Days of a Man," consisted partly
of business men educated at Har
vard or Yale, for it is sometimes
difficult to convince elderly gradu
ates of either of these institutions
that the system which prevailed in
their lay is not the best possible."
As the University grew certain
unforeseen complications threat
ened to result in an excess of wo
men students. In the years of liti
gation certain upperclassmen were
sent to higher institutions for ad
vanced training as Stanford did
not have the faeiH'ties. This led to
an impression that the men might
he outnumbered although even in
18!)!) there were 690 men and 463
women.
Alarmed at the advancing number
of women students Mrs. Stanford
set the f>oo limit. She said at the
time: "I have watched with inter
est the large growth in the attend
ance of women students, and if this
growth continues in the future . . .
the number of female students will
before long greatly exceed the num
ber of men, and thereby have it
regarded as a University for fe
males instead of for males. This
was not niy husband's wish, nor is
it mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
The San Francisco Chronicle of
June 2, 1899, declared it to be a

| simple question of time when Stan
ionl would be practically monopo
lized by women. "Were Stanford
women less attractive they would
| not increase the growing custom of
â– 'queening.' The more attractive wo
men at Stanford, the more queen
: ing there will be and the less active
participation in those student en
-1 terprises which make college spirit
| and athletic and forensic victories."
; Dr. Jordan was not consulted in
, the matter of limitation. Mrs. Stan
ford. according to the "Days of a
Man," "naively explained to the
i press* that Dr. Jordan would prob
ably be opposed, and she did not
wish "to be argued out of it."
"In the matter of equal educa
tion," says O. L. Elliot, in the
Alumnus, "the University may vol
untarily withdraw from its proud
and honorable leadership to !ag on
! the tail of tlie procession. But the
i procession will go on just the
I same."
