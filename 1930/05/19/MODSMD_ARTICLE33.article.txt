THE STANFORD ROUGH
The Stanford rough is not so swell,
Is our opinion grave abd frank,
lie talks and acts and loves like hell.
In classes we shall have to tell
He doesn't even near us rank.

lie talks and acts and loves like hell.
No Stanford woman ever fell
For campus man with mind so
blank.
The Stanford rough is not so swell.
Mis mind is just an empty well,
| Hut inside he's a steel-lined tank.
11<> talks and acts and loves like hell.
We would gladly sound his knell;
With joy we'd see him walk the
plank.
