## STANFORD TAKES SECOND PLACE IN SATURDAY'S MEET Dyer Wins From Wykoff in 220; Hables Takes First in 440 
### Mary Lee Richmond 
In competiton made brilliant by j
I hi' breaking of one world's record, j
:uiil by thrilling individual perform- j
ances iiiid hard-fought duels, the |
Trojan track team won the Califor
ni:i Intercollegiate meet held Sal- |
urday afternoon in the Stanford j
Stadium, scoring a total of 78 11.-lfi ■
points.
The Cardinal showing was far !
from disappointing, with many of '
the til 1-15 joints which gave Stan- j
lord second place coming from dis- j
tinguished work in unexpected i
quarters. California took third with j
17 l-.'in points, and IT.C I;.A. fourth ,
with 7 1-30.
lOric Krenz was responsible for j
the afternoon's greatest single l'eat. j
With one foul and two' fair throws 1
■ iirpassing his own'previous world's
record mark in the discus, Krenz '
.-ave the spectators some breath-i
taking moments. His throw of lt!4
feet had everyone gasping, but one j
spike outside the circle before the j
heave disqualified this record. A
few seconds later a steel tape found
the discus lt!7 feet 5% inches from j
where it left Krenz's powerful arm, |
a distance nearly 4 feet better than '
the former record of 1(!3 feet 8% 112
inches.
Official Record
The presence of an A.A.tT. official j
nl the meet, and the steel tape !
measurement, establishes this new '
record as official beyond any doubt. !
The throw was a perfect one on
which Krenz did not even approach
folding.
Wykoff's revenge over "Hec" !
Dyer in the 100-yard dash was !
wiped out when Dyer came back I
in the 220 to defeat the Trojan by ;
a decisive margin. Wykoff's start '
in the 100 was better than Dyer's, !
and he went immediately into the j
lead. Dyer did not get into his real j
stride until after the 20-yard mark, I
and although he gathered speed !
later was unable to overtake i

Wykoff, who reached the tape an
I easy three yards ahead.
In the 220-yard lash, Dyer cut
' down ihe lead which the Southern
, star's superior start gave hjni early
1 in (he race, running < j ven with him
! until about fifty yards from the
! finish, when he passed WykolT with
! apparent ease and flashed to the
: tape, victor by over a yard.
Hables Stars
"Ike" Hables of Stanford In the
relay and the 440 ran two of the
1 prettiest races of his career. 11 is
. spectacular victory in the 440, in
i which his time of 48.8 seconds was
i the best lie has ever done, was a
i complete upset, as he had been
conceded only a second place. Fine
headwork in passing tlie U.S.O.
men on the turn before the last
straightaway, and a heroic spurt at
the finish gave Hables a deserved
but unexpected win over Chuck
Woessner of U.S.C.

From the spectators' standpoint
the relay was the most thrilling
event of the meet. Stanford's per
formance in the absence of Johnny
Morrison was almost incredibly
good, and made the brilliant IT.S.C.
team fight every foot of the way.
An upset occurred in the low
hurdles when Nisbet, who had
spilled badly on the second barrier
in the highs, took the measure of
both Smith and Pogolotti, placing
third behind Carls and Payne of
U.S.C.
Smith's brilliant victory over
Pogolotti of California in the 120
high hurdles was also in the nature
of an upset, for the Stanford hurd
ler had been suffering from a slight
slump.

Hables Stars
"Ike" Hables of Stanford In the
relay and the 440 ran two of the
1 prettiest races of his career. 11 is
. spectacular victory in the 440, in
i which his time of 48.8 seconds was
i the best lie has ever done, was a
i complete upset, as he had been
conceded only a second place. Fine
headwork in passing tlie U.S.O.
men on the turn before the last
straightaway, and a heroic spurt at
the finish gave Hables a deserved
but unexpected win over Chuck
Woessner of U.S.C.

From the spectators' standpoint
the relay was the most thrilling
event of the meet. Stanford's per

Morrison was almost incredibly
good, and made the brilliant IT.S.C.

An upset occurred in the low

Hables Stars
"Ike" Hables of Stanford In the
relay and the 440 ran two of the
1 prettiest races of his career. 11 is
. spectacular victory in the 440, in
i which his time of 48.8 seconds was
i the best lie has ever done, was a
i complete upset, as he had been
conceded only a second place. Fine
headwork in passing tlie U.S.O.
men on the turn before the last
straightaway, and a heroic spurt at
the finish gave Hables a deserved

Woessner of U.S.C.

From the spectators' standpoint

In competiton made brilliant by j
I hi' breaking of one world's record, j
:uiil by thrilling individual perform- j
ances iiiid hard-fought duels, the |
Trojan track team won the Califor
ni:i Intercollegiate meet held Sal- |
urday afternoon in the Stanford j
Stadium, scoring a total of 78 11.-lfi ■
points.
The Cardinal showing was far !
from disappointing, with many of '
the til 1-15 joints which gave Stan- j
lord second place coming from dis- j
tinguished work in unexpected i
quarters. California took third with j
17 l-.'in points, and IT.C I;.A. fourth ,
with 7 1-30.
lOric Krenz was responsible for j
the afternoon's greatest single l'eat. j
With one foul and two' fair throws 1
■ iirpassing his own'previous world's
record mark in the discus, Krenz '
.-ave the spectators some breath-i
taking moments. His throw of lt!4
feet had everyone gasping, but one j
spike outside the circle before the j
heave disqualified this record. A
few seconds later a steel tape found
the discus lt!7 feet 5% inches from j
where it left Krenz's powerful arm, |
a distance nearly 4 feet better than '
the former record of 1(!3 feet 8% 112
inches.
Official Record
The presence of an A.A.tT. official j
nl the meet, and the steel tape !
measurement, establishes this new '
record as official beyond any doubt. !
The throw was a perfect one on
which Krenz did not even approach
folding.
Wykoff's revenge over "Hec" !
Dyer in the 100-yard dash was !
wiped out when Dyer came back I
in the 220 to defeat the Trojan by ;
a decisive margin. Wykoff's start '
in the 100 was better than Dyer's, !
and he went immediately into the j
lead. Dyer did not get into his real j
stride until after the 20-yard mark, I
and although he gathered speed !
later was unable to overtake i

Wykoff, who reached the tape an
I easy three yards ahead.
In the 220-yard lash, Dyer cut
' down ihe lead which the Southern
, star's superior start gave hjni early
1 in (he race, running < j ven with him
! until about fifty yards from the
! finish, when he passed WykolT with
! apparent ease and flashed to the
: tape, victor by over a yard.
Hables Stars
"Ike" Hables of Stanford In the
relay and the 440 ran two of the
1 prettiest races of his career. 11 is
. spectacular victory in the 440, in
i which his time of 48.8 seconds was
i the best lie has ever done, was a
i complete upset, as he had been
conceded only a second place. Fine
headwork in passing tlie U.S.O.
men on the turn before the last
straightaway, and a heroic spurt at
the finish gave Hables a deserved
but unexpected win over Chuck
Woessner of U.S.C.

From the spectators' standpoint
the relay was the most thrilling
event of the meet. Stanford's per
formance in the absence of Johnny
Morrison was almost incredibly
good, and made the brilliant IT.S.C.
team fight every foot of the way.
An upset occurred in the low
hurdles when Nisbet, who had
spilled badly on the second barrier
in the highs, took the measure of
both Smith and Pogolotti, placing
third behind Carls and Payne of
U.S.C.
Smith's brilliant victory over
Pogolotti of California in the 120
high hurdles was also in the nature
of an upset, for the Stanford hurd
ler had been suffering from a slight
slump.

lesults of the meet:
