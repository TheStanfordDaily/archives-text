# BASEBALL CLASSIC WON BY PRESS IN ANNUAL CONTEST
## Type-Slingers Pile Total Of Thirteen Runs To Five For Daily 
### 
Scoring thirteen runs in a ramp
ant game, the Press ball-tossers
carried off the seventh annual
Daily-Press baseball classic by de
feating the journalists 1 .'I-ft Sunday
morning.
The encounter was a battle royal
in which the hoped-for Daily re
venge failed. Jernegan's perfect
batting average in three trips to
the plate and Ricklel's two-bagger
featured the Daily's batting. Kull
man stopped a fly in left field by a
sensational running catch and Pai
llette made a tricky shoestring
catch in the lirst frame.
The typesetters were the first, to
score when four runs were brought,
in during the third inning. The
Daily retaliated in the fifth when
Klein came in on Jernegan's hit.
Two more tallies were made by liils
of Gould, Ricklel's, and McGarr in
the sixth. By a series of walks and
i errors the Press made two more
runs in the seventh, while Jerne-
I gan added another for the Daily.
Poor base-running, however, cut
short the ink-slingers' attempted
rally. The Press got two more in
the eighth, and in the second half
of the . inning Kullman, the Daily's
last scorer, romped home on Jerne
i gan's hit. The Press men scored
five more runs in the ninth.
Carl Oliver was chief arbiter of
, Sunday's fray.
