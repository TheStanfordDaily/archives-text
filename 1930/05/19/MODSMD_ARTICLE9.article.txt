# CHORUSES, MELODIES, AND COMEDY BRING SUCCESS TO JUNIOR OPERA
## 
### BY THE STAFF REVIEWER 
Romance, color, action, fast-step
j ping choruses, tuneful melodies,
and comedy combined last Satur
day night to make "Mardi (Jras"
! one of the highlights of Junior
i Opera history and an outstanding
i addition to the l.9I>() dramatic sea
i son.
"Mardi Gras" was a good show.
| Its success goes first lo the three
'co-authors, Joe Thompson, Helen
I Thompson, arid Nelson Carter, who
were spontaneously applauded by
. the large audience present, and
! who gave a well-worked-out plot
with many opportunities for eolor
| fill effects and dramatic moments.
Secondly, the success of the pro-
I duction is due Harold llelvenston
whose artistic skill created picture
after picture, and whose, direction
kept the show moving along so
j quickly that in spite of the abun
| dant action, it was over at. I0:ii0.
Cabaret Scene Best
The cabare 1 scene is one future
t Stanford productions can well look
. back to as n height of realistic
I direction and musical effectiveness.
, Smoothly, without a drop in tone
|or action, the. scene speeded
j through comedy and the exception
ally good bit of the Broadway
Babies admirably led by Margaret
Willis.

I Vivacity and grace were put into
the role of iVlartha Lee Meredith
by Jean Jamison. Her lovely ap
hiearance added immeasurably to
her singing. Of her songs, "I Want
You To Know," by Bob Thornton
with lyrics by Talbert Morgan and
Dick Amyx, was the most effective,
| although none of her songs were
I pitched especially well for the tone
of her voice.
' Helen Ward as Sue had person
ality and her song with John Skin
ner as Dick' Meredith was worthy
of any Broadway musical comedy.
It was a. touch of real professional
ism. The song. "I Could Get Hen 1.1-
mental About You," by Helen Sue
Kyster, was one of the best.
Logan Real Comedian
in Harry Dee Dogan Stanford has
I round a real comedian. As Slip he
i got many a laugh and one of the
comic highlights was his "Kalli
kak" song, aided by a very abb;
i chorus of Bowery maids. Annele
McGee played Aunt Duey with real
comedy sense. Bob Perry put a
nice accent in the part of Andrew.
The two young heroes were el
i lee lively played by Trow Stephens
and John Skinner. Stephens has a
nice voice although it is somewhat
1 lacking in volume. George Shibley
shone in his role of Frenehie. His
accent was splendid.
Tom I'ike made a most convinc
ing sea captain, and put some of
the best acting in the opera into
"Red Fletcher." 800 Haw ley as
Sven was excellent, and Anne Mc-
Sweeney as Dolly was well-suited
lo her role. The seamen, negro ser
vants, plainclothesmen, and molls
all did well and were handled nice
ly by Helvenston.
When Stanford dramatics can
produce such well-trained and pro
fessional looking choruses, it is
easy to sec that the old days of
weak chorus acts have gone. From
thi! "Holiday" dance through tlie
Mardi Gras chorus, the dancing
was even, well-executed, and well
directed by Terry Brickley.
The music was consistently
good, and the audience would eas
ily have appreciated several en
cores especially of Joe Thompson's
"WorkinV "Black Boy," by Austin
Shean, was unusually well done,
and tiie theme song, "Mardi Gras,"
was spirited and tuneful. The "Mid
night Tide" was a stirring addition
to the wharf scene.
Frederic Stover's sets of the
Meredith home and the cafe were
exceptionally good. The dock set
was realistic but did not quite
measure up to the colorful and ro
mantic aspects of the other two.
Junior operas year after year in
dicate that student voices are not
strong enough to be heard all over
the Assembly Hall, and this year
was no exception. This was one of
"Mardi Gras' " weaknesses. Another
was I lie lapse of some moments be
tween scenes one and two of Act
11. Bill Ilia! wait only serves to
show again as has been so clearly
deniostrated time after time that
Stanford needs a new theatre.
