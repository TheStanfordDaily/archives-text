SAN J"'KAN CISCO, May 19
(/I 3 ). —Crystallized limestone re
sembles gold ore, luit a 20-pound
sack of it is worth only 20 cents
or so, instead of about $10,000.
Anyway—
Herbert Carson of Dublin,
Cab, made the mistake of put
ling the 20 pounds of limestone
with which lie intended to deco
rate a gold fish pool, into a bag
with a Federal Reserve bag
stamp on it.
The bag was heavy, so ( ar
son left it on a seat in a ferry
boat while lie sought a cup of
coffee, and some wealth seeker -
Advertising today for the re
turn of the bag, Carson offered
to furnish enough limestone to
completely line a gold lish pool,
if the thief would only furnish
his own truck.
