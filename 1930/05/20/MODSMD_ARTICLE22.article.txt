## Lockout Group Will Give Definite Suggestions At Open Meet Major Activity Positions To Be Limited 
### 
Working over tho objections
made to the tentative lockout plan
submitted at. the last Conference
meeting, the committee look up tho
problem of maladjustment of time
yesterday. The finul proposal will
be presented to the campus at an
open Conference meeting Friday at
1 o'clock in the Women's Club
house.
The waste of time which would
naturally occur in transition from
rules to no rules and which is also
present under the lockout system
used now, was deemed one of the
major problems, ranking with
health and scholastic standing.
That time wasted in activities
' be cheeked, not by a point system,
i but hy preventing women to hold
j more than one major office at a
jlime, was recommended as an ac
| lion for Conference lo take imni' 1
â–  diately. The major activities were
considered: Positions on AAV.S.
I Council; women's editor of the
| Quad; women's editor of the Daily;
business manager of the Quad;
president of W.A.A.; member of
Ex Committee; and president of
Y.W.C.A.
It was also recommended thai
persons be requested lo ask the in
! dividual's permission before nomi-
I naling her for any office, and I hat
: all unnecessary activities, clubs,
I and organizations bo dropped,
j These suggestions were given to
eliminate much of the over-activity
j on the part of a small group and
to give more people a chance to
hold major offices on the campus.
Other wastes of time sucli as
i "bulling" and card playing were
held be influenced only by the
living group.
Waste of lime and its result on
health was taken care of in the
i health committee plan. Under this
j system there would be a Council
j member directly under Dr. Bertha
1 Dymenf who would have under her
a chairman in each living group.
These living group chairmen on
| the How could appoint assistants
j and in Roble a group of sixteen
| subehairmen would aei as eo-ordin
j titors under one head. This com
| mitl.ee system would form a direei
j liaison between Dr. Dynienl and
jibe women who need medical care.
Scholarship was also considered,
land it was proposed that anyone
j below a C average either the pro
ceeding quarter or in the bawloul
have no (ale leaves during the
| week, and no overnight leaves ex
cept with special permission.
