"\'<> lockout rules for juniors, seniors, and graduates,
with modified regulations for the lower division, was the
tentative plan submitted by the lockout committee to Con
ference at an open Conference meeting this week."
Such was the startling information dispensed vesterdav by the
Daily -the annual Women's Kdition of the Daily, at that. To
lltose who entertained doubts of the s()o's liberalism, the news is
start ling—and encouraging.
With the Stanford women taking such action on their own in
itiative. ii seems likely that common sense will eventually win out,
and the harm will be blest: with a scarcity of regulations that dis
criminate against one sex.
I his is all very well. The women are to be commended.
Hit! when is definite action to be expected?
The women have now convened, and reconvened, and recon
vened again. They have discussed the matter from at least 30
dillerent angles. They have had votes, plans, conferences, lectures,
and committee meetings.
It is greal Inn, of course, bill all good things must end, von
know.
Wouldn't it be nice il the mailer were ended right now?
The question has been as well formulated as it ever can be. It
should be put before ( (inference -where it will undoubtedly be
passed: and then presented to the Administration. The Adminis
tration must decide eventually, anyhow. Why shouldn't the matter
In placed before those who are to make that final decision.
The mailer could be—and should he—closed within the week,
as far as Ihe women themselves are concerned.
