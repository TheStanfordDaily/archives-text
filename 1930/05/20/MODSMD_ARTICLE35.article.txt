Down :i! the Cniversitv'of California at Los Angeles, the Cali
fornia Daily Bruin, student newspaper, is worrying in its editorial
< <tlnnins over the inferiority complex possessed by student's. The
Brum urges the six thousand-odd members of its student body to
refrain from referring to the Alma Mater as "California." The
editor would rather have them say "C.C.L.A."
I he editorial writer, in a true Kotarian spirit, comes forth and
a ks his readers why they should hide their light under the pro
verbial bushel he wants the initials of C.C.L.A. blazoned forth to
the world on belt buckles, pennants, and all the regulation para
phernalia indicating collegiate affiliation.
I he Bruin declares that the day will come when "we deem it
best to resent our being called by thai name" referring to the Cali
lornia designation. The editor calls upon his to take
rightful cognizance of the "mouthful of initials" belonging to
I.( land to become imbued with the proper spirit of pride.
"Collcf/r Humor and other publications of national circulation refer
to the university as C.C.L.A.," says the editorial. "Other educa
tional plants arc known by letters. Most of them have three, a few
have two. and we have four. We, at least, are distinctive."
While the Bruin exhorts its readers to demonstrative loyalty, the
Daii.v wonders why I .L.A. bothers itself about matriculating
students who are ashamed to admit their affiliations after four years
ot more or less academic effort. Xo real university and real spirit
can be constructed upon such a foundation.
