AMONG THE MARRIED—At the
Geary Theatre, San Francisco.
"Among (he Marriod" is indis
putably tiif best marital drama
j which has been shown in San Fran
cisco this season.
The piny has a very powerful H
feet, whose full strength, however,
is curiously retarded. During the
J lirst act you wonder what there is
about it which could have made
George G. Nathan of the New York
Times pronounce it the best play
I of the year. The plot unfolds slow
l 1 y, the dialogue is surprisingly
commonplace, and the five charac
ters are on the surface quite or
dinary people. Among the two mar
-1 ried couples, both the women are
strong characters, and both the
i men are weak. Ironically, the wife
witli the strong moral fibre is mar
ried to the man who is incapable
of fidelity, while the wife without
morals has an irreproachable, hut
spineless husband. The fifth char
acter is a suave outsider, whose
claim to social position rests on
the excellence of his golf game, and
t he fact that married women in
evitably found him attractive.
The playwright has handled his
situations with brilliantly executed
j realism, and a feeling for t he chem
istry of human relationships, in a
] manner which is neither sensation
| al nor sophisticated, but which
| goes deeper than sophistication and
gives the subtly revealed disinte
; gration of the characters in the last
j act a terrifically gripping power.
Lines, plot, even the actors them
selves are of secondary importance
to the penetrating psychological
and emotional study given to the
I audience in this play.
Deft exposing of the concrete
moral aspects of the play does not
constitute its real brilliance. The
picture of one husband falling prey
: to the obvious wiles of a bored,
j viciously shallow woman, whose
I own husband suiters from chronic
I nervous indigestion, is interesting
enough, but you are familiar with
it already. It is the impression with
which you leave of having seen
with absolute clarity the working
| of the characters' minds and hearts
I which testifies to the essential force
land originality of the play.
| Robert Frazer has a difficult role
! which he fails to emphasize prop
| erly. As a result his performance
j is fuzzy. Miami Alvarez knows far
[too little of the technique of re
straint, the one quality most im
peratively demanded by her part,
j Dudley Ayres and Barbara, in the
i shorter roles do somewhat superior
! work, yet the cast as a whole is
not equal to the play. Nevertheless
| we still insist, that "Among the

I Married" should not he miSßed.

AMONG THE MARRIED—At the
Geary Theatre, San Francisco.
"Among (he Marriod" is indis
putably tiif best marital drama
j which has been shown in San Fran
cisco this season.
The piny has a very powerful H
feet, whose full strength, however,
is curiously retarded. During the
J lirst act you wonder what there is
about it which could have made
George G. Nathan of the New York
Times pronounce it the best play
I of the year. The plot unfolds slow
l 1 y, the dialogue is surprisingly
commonplace, and the five charac
ters are on the surface quite or
dinary people. Among the two mar
-1 ried couples, both the women are
strong characters, and both the
i men are weak. Ironically, the wife
witli the strong moral fibre is mar
ried to the man who is incapable
of fidelity, while the wife without
morals has an irreproachable, hut
spineless husband. The fifth char
acter is a suave outsider, whose
claim to social position rests on
the excellence of his golf game, and
t he fact that married women in
evitably found him attractive.
The playwright has handled his
situations with brilliantly executed
j realism, and a feeling for t he chem
istry of human relationships, in a
] manner which is neither sensation
| al nor sophisticated, but which
| goes deeper than sophistication and
gives the subtly revealed disinte
; gration of the characters in the last
j act a terrifically gripping power.
Lines, plot, even the actors them
selves are of secondary importance
to the penetrating psychological
and emotional study given to the
I audience in this play.
Deft exposing of the concrete
moral aspects of the play does not
constitute its real brilliance. The
picture of one husband falling prey
: to the obvious wiles of a bored,
j viciously shallow woman, whose
I own husband suiters from chronic
I nervous indigestion, is interesting
enough, but you are familiar with
it already. It is the impression with
which you leave of having seen
with absolute clarity the working
| of the characters' minds and hearts
I which testifies to the essential force
land originality of the play.
| Robert Frazer has a difficult role
! which he fails to emphasize prop
| erly. As a result his performance
j is fuzzy. Miami Alvarez knows far
[too little of the technique of re
straint, the one quality most im
peratively demanded by her part,
j Dudley Ayres and Barbara, in the
i shorter roles do somewhat superior

AMONG THE MARRIED—At the
Geary Theatre, San Francisco.
"Among (he Marriod" is indis
putably tiif best marital drama
j which has been shown in San Fran
cisco this season.
The piny has a very powerful H
feet, whose full strength, however,
is curiously retarded. During the
J lirst act you wonder what there is
about it which could have made
George G. Nathan of the New York
Times pronounce it the best play
I of the year. The plot unfolds slow
l 1 y, the dialogue is surprisingly
commonplace, and the five charac
ters are on the surface quite or
dinary people. Among the two mar
-1 ried couples, both the women are
strong characters, and both the
i men are weak. Ironically, the wife
witli the strong moral fibre is mar
ried to the man who is incapable
of fidelity, while the wife without
morals has an irreproachable, hut
spineless husband. The fifth char
acter is a suave outsider, whose
claim to social position rests on
the excellence of his golf game, and
t he fact that married women in
evitably found him attractive.
The playwright has handled his
situations with brilliantly executed
j realism, and a feeling for t he chem
istry of human relationships, in a
] manner which is neither sensation
| al nor sophisticated, but which
| goes deeper than sophistication and
gives the subtly revealed disinte
; gration of the characters in the last
j act a terrifically gripping power.
Lines, plot, even the actors them
selves are of secondary importance
to the penetrating psychological
and emotional study given to the
I audience in this play.
Deft exposing of the concrete
moral aspects of the play does not
constitute its real brilliance. The
picture of one husband falling prey
: to the obvious wiles of a bored,
j viciously shallow woman, whose
I own husband suiters from chronic
I nervous indigestion, is interesting
enough, but you are familiar with
it already. It is the impression with
which you leave of having seen
with absolute clarity the working
| of the characters' minds and hearts
I which testifies to the essential force
land originality of the play.
| Robert Frazer has a difficult role
! which he fails to emphasize prop
| erly. As a result his performance
j is fuzzy. Miami Alvarez knows far
[too little of the technique of re
straint, the one quality most im
peratively demanded by her part,
j Dudley Ayres and Barbara, in the
i shorter roles do somewhat superior
! work, yet the cast as a whole is
not equal to the play. Nevertheless
| we still insist, that "Among the

I Married" should not he miSßed.
