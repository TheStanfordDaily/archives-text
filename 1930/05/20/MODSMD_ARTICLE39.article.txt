# A 						LOW QUEENING RATE
## 
### 
; Tim Editor, Sir:
Stanford women are the most
conceited, high-hat, unuppreeiati ve
J gold-diggers known to men. Despite
which I hey wonder why Stanford
men prefer "imports."
They are egotistical enough to
ask, "of the Odd men, how many
jean rate one of the r>00?" A more
| logical question would he: of the
, 3,000 men, how many would WANT
; to rate one of the 500?
On what grounds do these self
idolizing women consider them
selves of such importance and per
fection that they should dictate to
the men just how, when, and where
they should do what? They expect
corsages for formals, they insist
i upon punctuality (laugh, Clown,
I laugh!), they criticize the dancing
of the men, and they even go so
| far as to condemn the appearance

I of the men.
On her part, the Stanford co-ed
, will condescend to honor her es-
I cort witli her presence for a few
I hours that is if he lias the prere
quisites of an expensive car and
lots of money.
After all this they wonder why
the queening rate is low. I suggest
that our local talent take a few
I pertinent lessons from the hated
importsâ€”those California and Mills
co-eds of whom the Stanford men
i sing praises.
! Competition at these two schools
,is much greater, with the result
that the women are not so high-hat.
| They are even appreciative of what
is done for them., They offer some
incentive to the Stanford men to
! send corsages and keep up their
j appearances. Not so around here!
