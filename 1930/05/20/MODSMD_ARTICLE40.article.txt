I The Editor, Sir:
Bitter, bitter, hitter. "Experi
enced in Love," how often imve
you been on a campus date ihis
month? That is, where did you Ret
your experience? Some blighted
female wrote in this column yes
terday bewailing the fact that "im
ports" are rather stealing the show
from Stanford women, as regards
our local lotharios.
Well, what does she expect?
j Stanford women ARE attractive,
| some of them, but there are only
I 500. What are Stanford men to do?
: The ratio is (ive to one, with the
twenty-five hundred men here, so
| "imports" are the answer. Mills wo
men aren't so bad, either. And nei-
I ther are the Stanford men.
But corsages! Leave us men
i alone on this delicate point. It's an
1 old Stanford custom. Stanford wo
1 men are Stanford women, and they
would probably look better in a
noose of flowers, but it just isn't
done. And don't start it.
Copying "Experienced in Love,"
I the girls from the Farm inifln "yet
j wise" to the following:

! 1. Don't bo seen abroad in your
gym suits. You look like a "Mardi
Gras" chorus. (Broadway Babes.)
2. Wear corsages for formnls.
They only cost a. little, and mean
so much.
"Unshaved faces and un
combed hair" hi least look mascu
line, as are the men, but bare legs
and powder-caked female physiog
nomies don't even look feminine.
Well, pood luck next Saturday.
Phil and Bill.
