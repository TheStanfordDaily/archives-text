' \\ itli more audacity than discretion,
tin- lair members of our Five Hun
dred (may their tribe increase!) burst
forth yesterday in a terrify inn man
panning; orgy. Of course this evoked
a storm of protest from the male
population, which must unfortunately
he censored, due to reasons of expe
dience. Being a mere "live-I'eet thrce
er," we hardly dare to bring upon out
head the wrath oi those overpowering
six-foot Junos described in their so
excellent example of the villanelle.
The prospect of being quashed by their
down-thrust thumb is far from en
couraging. Besides, we intend to be
come a (/i</(>!<) (you know, one of those
professional "party-boys") after we
graduate, and feminine support is in
dispensable in that vocation. For these
and other reasons, /><j.r r'obiscnm; fam
ily rows are so unbecoming ! And here
is a little pretty to appease the choler
of all of you. Is everybody happy:
BEFORE A DATE
Tonight
We shall be together.
Alone,
For many long, delicious hours;
M\ hand will steal softly
And gently
Into yours,
And I will look into your eyes
And say, "I love you,"
And you will look into my eves,
And say, "I love you,"
And tomorrow night
We shall go out
And say it again
To i wo other people.
