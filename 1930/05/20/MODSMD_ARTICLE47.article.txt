# DATA MAILED IN ON INFORMATION BLANKS
## 
### 
About 300 replies to the mer
chandise questionnaires sent out
by the business staffs of the Quad,
Daily and Chaparral, have been re
ceived to date. Interviews will be
completed this week, and if all
questionnaires are filled out and,
returned by that time, tabulation
of statistics can begin.
Question blanks have been num
bered so that account has been kept
of those which have not yet been
mailed to Publications Council. If
students lind any difficulty in giv
ing' data, E. W. Field, who is in
charge, requests that blanks be re
turned. However, all information
received will be kept strictly con
fidential.
