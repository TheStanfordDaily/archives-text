Of all tin 1 lesser lights that
"Pop" Warner's stalwarts will meet
next fall, the only ones that should
cause any difficulty to the lied
Machine are the Olympic flub,
Santa flam, and Oregon State. And
since the last-named is the only
Conference team in lite lot, and
that happens to he the weakest of
the three, the Cardinals are not
overly worried over the so-called
practice games.
The Orangemen will have at
least nine lettermen back and
probably several more by the
time autumn quarter rolls
around. At that, however,
twelve lettermen, including
seven regulars, have played
their last game for the Beav
ers. Prominent among those
that will leave the rain-soaked
campus in June are Captain
Gilmore, Essman, and Mont
gomery, all backfield men, and
Striff and Stout, end and tackle,
, respectively.
The men, about !>') of theni,
turned out for the iirst day of prac
tice on February 28, and Coach
Paul Schissler is about ready to
close up until September. Probably
the most notable of the men that
will play Stanford on October IS,
just a week after the Card-Minne
sota lilt back in American Scandi
navia, is Henry "Kanak" Hughes,
dusky and husky punter, place
kicker, passer, and line crasher
from Hawaii. Sherwood and Kerr
will probably be the regular halves
with ijuerke at quarter. Nosier,
Owen, Peterson, Lawson, and Davis
are their outstanding competitors.
Muck Hammer iias been shitted
to center, and Thompson and Cox
will play in their old positions at
guards. Byington and Young are
the best bets at tackle, and Alc-
Kalip and McGilvray or Rust will
probably be on the flanks. Schissler
is concentrating on a ,strong for
ward wall and lias made several
shifts in the positions.
The Olympic Club game,
coming, as usual, two weeks
after the start of fall practice
and the Saturday before Regis
tration Day, is always a thril
ler. The Winged "O" never fails
to throw a scare into the Cards
and, like Santa Clara, manage
to beat the Redshirts with un
pleasant regularity.
This year the Post Streeters are
dickering for the services of Boh
Sims and Lud Frentrup, and al
ready have the old standbvs of
Mort Kaer, Ford, McLean, Kuhn,
Diehl, Watson, Granucci, and
Speicher. They all wear big double
numbers on their jerseys like
Grange to emphasize their abili
ties. Just a long hard afternoon of
power plays looms in the offing.
The Mission outfit down the road
has lost about half the team but
at that will undoubtedly toss a few
monkey wrenches into .the ;ver
mil ion machinery. Simoni is
though and Johnny Casanova,
famous Bronco athlete, was killed
last winter. A 1 liuffo, star guard,
and Milt Axt, perennial all-sport
man, have been appointed to coach
the freshmen next year and that,
lets them out. llerm Mettler is left,
but Mr. Mettler was the whole
show on a certain frigid day last
November when the Green team
passed its way to two touchdowns
ami victory.
Then there's Tassi, their
Heinecke-like center, Howard
O'Daniels, their Tandy-like
tackle, and a few other big
brutes. Jerry Lee, a transfer
from Georgetown, will vie with
Mettler in throwing passes, and
Storm, the Y.M.I, boy of two
years back who beat Stanford
with his lone touchdown, will
bolster up the backfield. The
freshman class contributes Sla
vich, an end, Morey, a back,
and Powers, a punter. Right
now. considering Stanford's
usual pre-season slow start, the
Broncs are favored to win on
October 4.
The West Coast Army has never
been considered even a workout,
granting that it does meet the
Cards on September 20. just, five
days after the start of practice. !

I But this year two new men have
I been assigned to the Ninth Corps
| Area that may mean trouble. They
; are Johnny Murrel and Buster
| Perry, full and tackle respectively,
on last year's West Point eleven.
Murrel ranked next to Cagle last
[year, and Perry has been playing
| in college football circles for eight
long years. The Army also lias
! Ganttzzi, and the new coach, Cap
i tain Ross TvlacKechnie, may pull a
! surprise.
U.C.L.A. won't have much to
offer on November 1, except
that the line will be heavier
than last year. Coach Bill
Spaulding ended spring prac
tice last Friday and has on
hand Ed Hassler, speedy half,
and Captain El Solomon and
Norfleet, former all-city, 245-
pounder from Manual Arts
High, in the tackle berths, but
that's about all.
The only other is the Cal Tech
set-up 011 November 15, sandwiched
in between Washington and Cali
fornia. Well, the Engineersâ€”aw,
who cares?
The fifth article will consider the
prospects that "His Nibs" over in
Berkeley is worrying about.
