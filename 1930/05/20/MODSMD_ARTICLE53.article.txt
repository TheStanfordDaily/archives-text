# Sequoia Nine Defeats El Toro For Mural Title
## HULL TEAM WINS EASILY 13-0; COPS 1930 BALL TROPHY Trimmingham Allows Two Hits And Strikes Out Eight Clubmen 
### 
Superior hurling backed with air
tight fielding enabled the Sequoia
I nine to blank the El Toro outfit
on the varsity diamond yesterday
and cinch the mural ball trophy
for 1930. Heavy hitting by the
champions interspersed with plenti
ful errors on the part of the El
Toro team accounted for the lop
sided count of 13 to 0.
Triinmingham pitched sterling
ball for the victors, allowing but
two hits and striking out eight men
in the seven-period contest. Hub
bard on the mound for the club nine
had trouble in finding the plate, is
suing seven free passes in five in
nings, when P. Reed went in to
hold the Sequoia sluggers to but
one tally for the last two frames.
Sequoia started scoring in the
first when Triinmingham walked.
Mack reached first when he was
hit by a wild throw, and Richards
accounted for a neat single to bring
in two. After a hit and a walk had
loaded the bags, Mundt connected
for a two-bagger to clean the bases
and bring the total to five runs be
fore the side was retired. With the
game already on ice, the Sequoia
stars had little trouble in adding
tallies till the final inning.
Richards at shortstop for the vic
tors led the hitting with three
bingles out of four trips to the
plate, while Miller and Farwell
each had two for three. For the
I Toro nine, Brown and Hubbard gar
nered the only two blows for their
outfit.
