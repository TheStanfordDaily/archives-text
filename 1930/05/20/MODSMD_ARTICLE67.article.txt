# CHEMISTRY OF GREAT AID TO ARCHAEOLOGY SAYS DOCTOR FOSTER

### 
"I!y the use of chemical research
and investigations chemistry lias
en,ll>l<id archaeologists to read many
books which otherwise would re
main a mystery to mankind," stated
Dr. William Foster of Princeton
University before the regular Mon
day chemistry seminar speaking on
"How the Chemist Helps the
Archaeologist."
"A professor of Spanish Litera
ture at Princeton in making inves
tigations among old libraries in
Spain discovered a valuable book
of the twelfth century, but it was
impossible to read the ink which
had faded away. The document was
brought to chemists and after re
search and study they were able
to make the ink perfectly legible.
"Chemical analysis of metals, al
loys, pigments, dyes, inks, manu
scripts, embalming materials, glaz
ings, enamels, cements, and other
subjects discovered by archaeolo
gists, are now often made and
prove of great value to the dis
coverers and of interest to science."
"Removal of oxides from bronze
coins in order to make them legi
ble. analysis of earth pigments and
innumerable ancient dyes, analysis
of cements used by ancient build
ers have been made by chemists to
assist archaeologists. A recent bit.
of work is that of the discovery of
the composition of the black gla/e
found on certain Creek pottery.
