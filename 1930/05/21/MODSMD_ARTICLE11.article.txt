# APPRECIATION OF NATIONAL PARKS AIDED BY PUBLICATION---J.R. WHITE
## 
### BY MARTHA INGE 
"I consider the work being done
by Stanford, in educating the pub
lic to appreciate national parks, as
great as any other single piece of
work accomplished by the Univer
sity." said Colonel John R. White,
superintendent of Sequoia and Gen
eral Grant national parks, in an
interview with the Daily.
Colonel White attributed a large
part of this work to the publica
tions of the University Press,
which include a national park
series, containing such books as
"Oh Ranger!" by Frank Taylor and
Horace N. Albright, director of
national parks, and "Big Trees,"
by Judge Walter Fry and Colonel
White. He also spoke of the close
connection between Stanford and
the National Park movement, be
cause President Hoover, whose
message to Congress contained
more about conservation than the
message of any other president, is
a Stanford graduate, and because
Secretary of the Interior Bay Ly

man Wilbur, president of Stanford, ]
is at the head of the supervision!
of the parks.. Colonel White told of !
the two proposed new parks. One I
ot these is the Shenandoah national 1
project in Virginia, where Presi-1
dent Hoover has his summer camp, I
ami the other is in the Great!
Smoky Mountains between Tennes-1
see and Virginia. According to the i
proposed plan the styte will own |
one half of these parks, and the
federal government the other half. I
It is probable that they will be :
established as soon as the privatel
property on the lands is purchased. '
Colonel White also spoke ol the |
natural beauty of the Sequoia Na- '
tional Park, particularly of the big 1
trees for which it is famous, and I
the slopes from the valley to the
mountains. Sequoia, he said, has j
not only the largest tree in this
country, but the greatest range in
altitude, with Ml. Whitney, 14,496
feet, the highest mountain in the
United States.
