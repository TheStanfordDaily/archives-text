# NEW ORCHESTRA WELL RECEIVED
## Guest Artist Praises Card Musical Group 
### 
"There; is much line talon in this
orchestra," said Wenceslao Villal
pando alter liis appearand 1 with
(lie Stanford Symphony Orchestra
last night in the Assembly llall.
"It the group will continue to work
for two years," added the San Fran
cisco 'cellist, "you will have a very
good orchestra. Two years is not a
long time to develop an orchestra."
Mr. Villalpamlo was the guest
artist with the orchestra in its first
campus performance. Mis Kol Nei
dra was deep and smooth in tone
and colorful in interpretation.
Schubert Played Well
The new Stanford orchestra
opened its program with a vivid
rendition of Schubert's Rosamunde
overture, which brought many
rounds of applause from a large
audience. Many felt that "Unfin
ished Symphony," the second num
ber, was an ambitious undertaking
for a newly organized group of
amateur musicians. However, the
afrtlfit ion Whs achieved in a beauTT'-"
fully finished performance. Tschai
kowksy's "Man-lie Slav" formed an
exciting climax to a surprisingly
good program.
Dan Bryant, director of t!iÂ«'
orchestra, lias trained his players
well in the few months of their or
ganization, and last night proved
himself a conductor of unusual abil
ity. His strings are stronger than
his woodwinds and brasses, but the
ensemble premises much after a
little more practice. The conduc
tor's interpretations wen; rather
more scholastic than original, as
they should be with a young musi
cian, and the execution of t.liem
was excellent. Klwyn Bugge, con
certmaster, did a particularly line
piece of work in leading a group
slightly inclined toward disunity
because of nervousness and inex
perience.
