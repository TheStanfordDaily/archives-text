## 
### 
"There is lunch fine talent in Ibis
Morgan Hill, nor to my knowledge
is there any indication of one,"
stated Hubert (1. Schenck, assistant
professor of geology, when asked
to confirm tho alleged statement
made by Professor Fred Buss of
I lie San Jose State Teachers Col
lege that Morgan Hill volcano was
not extinct.
According to Associated Press
dispatches, Professor Buss is re
ported to have said the town of
Morgan Hill, a few miles south of
San Jose, is resting upon a live
volcano. He is also credited with
the statement that Alum Hock
Park, the stone quarry back of
Stanford University, and the peak
back of Morgan Hill, are also vol
canic formations.
"The hill known as Morgan Hill
lias a conical shape resembling a

volcano," said Professor Schenok
In commenting upon Professor
Buss' statements, "but this is large
ly duo to erosion and not to vol
canie action. Ml. Lassen is tho only
active crater in California al pres
ent.
"The quarry near the Isolation
Hospital is in ail likelihood a de
posit of lava which flowed there
from an old volca.no probably lo
cated at Tuff Hill near Mayfleld. l!
was from this lava flow that nasal!
was formerly quarried to be used
for road metal there. Another de
posit wrom the same volcano is lo
cated back of Mayfield and is now
being used as a supply placed for
basalt," he concluded.
Austin Flint Rogers, professor of
mineralogy, agreed with Professor
Schenck that there is no danger of
any volcanic eruptions in the ter
ritory of Morgan Hill.
