# THE
						BEGINNING OF THE END
## 
### 
Like a dying man, consulting liis lawyer concerning a last will
and testament, the Editorial Hoard of Volume 77 yesterday went
about the business of making its own burial arrangements.
The present archaic Hoard appointed its own successors, named
others to be raised along the line, and officially set the stage for the
contest to see who is next to have the doubtful pleasure of editing
this newspaper.
To succeed .Miss Svlva Weaver as Women's Editor, Miss Eliza
beth Larsh was chosen; to follow Theodore DeMotte as Managing
Editor, William (irace was promoted : .Messrs. Frank Whiteley and
.Marvin Skipwith are to follow Messrs. (lale Wallace and Leonard
Hartlett as Associates; Reid I>riggs, Howard Moore. Richard
Kriendlich. Marv Lee Richmond, and Hetty Clarke will join John
Isaacs as night editors: Willis Sullivan is to be Associated I'ress
Editor: Elizabeth I lewit was chosen for Associated Press copy edi
tor; and Helen Sue Eyster and Margaret Friedman will be desk copy
editors.
< iale Wallace and Leonard Hartlett were formally nominated as
candidates for the editorship of Volume 78. An election will be
held next Tuesday.
So it goes. 11 ere today—gone tomorrow. Ah. me !
Xow is very denitely a lime for philosophy—sad, heart-rending
philosophy.
1 lut we shall save our philosophy and our heart-throbs for later
on. Volume 77—though growing old—is not yet dead. In these
last days of its waning light it shall splutter on ;is it has ever splut
tered.
It shall continue thus until the death knell is sounded, the swan
song is sung, and the masthead for the last time carries its allitera
tive designation.
Hut in spite of this refusal to be buried before its time. Volume
77 pauses a moment in its hectic course to compliment those who are
to trample it out of existence. May the process be as painless as r
possible.
