# NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER

### 
In considering the lockout problem from every possible angle,
tlie A.U .S. Committee happened upon the interesting question of
what to do with one's time. Some people seem to believe that no
regulations for upperclass co-eds would lead to wasted hours and
many dissipated moments.
Although the problem of ascertaining whether women fritter
awav their idle seconds in bridge playing or seeing movies may ap
pear to be far removed from lockout revision, in reality there is a
rather close connection. It is necessary to make it clear that wasted
lime would not result from the absence of restriction.
In order to find out just what women do with their time, cer
tain questionnaires were sent out .Monday night. The results will be
used in collection with one of the greatest objections to women's
social freedom—wasted time.
< )ne valuable suggestion has come out of this time-investigation:
that preventing one woman from holding more than one major
office be effected by Women's Conference in a recommendation.
This move does not mean the institution of a point system, but is
merely the beginning of a tradition—may it become one—that the
women's offices be distributed equally among those best fitted.
Fascinating as these discussions may be, however, and enlighten
ing as they may prove to alleged opponents of non-regulation, the
AAV.S. committee was appointed to find some ieasible plan for
lockout revision. In considering all sides of this most difficult prob
lem, it surely isn't necessary to go into each angle thoroughly. To be
sure, the Committee will be working until 1940 if each of the thirty
angles is probed, investigated, and thoroughly searched out.
Perhaps another angle of the situation could be viewed quite
adequately from an airplane.
