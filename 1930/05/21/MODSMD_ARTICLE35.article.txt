MEN IN SHIRT SLEEVES — By
Benvenuto Sheard. Viking Press,
New York. 1930.
"Men in Shirt Sleeves," subtitled
"Some Scenes (if Vanity," is alto
gether it delightful find refreshing
book. With so much of our litera
ture presenting sordidness and
pessimism, it is a relief to find tin
author who can laugh and make
his reader feel superior.
Benvenulo Sheard is new to
American readers. He writes of
those deliriously sophisticated peo
ple who blandly defy conventions,
say most, unexpected things at
equally unexpected moments, who
offer profound philosophy of lil'e
and follow by asking you to pass
the butter.
In other words Sheard lias satir
ised those unusual characters that
appear in the writing of such crea
tors as Wilde, Huxley, and Noel
Coward. And lie does it so much
to your complete satisfaction that
you will be likely to state in an
excited moment thai this book is
the creation of the century- bill it
is highly probable that its clever
ness will have caught you off your
guard.
Manfred, the main character, is
one of those people who bus never
gained the habit of living a life.
He strives to find a purpose in it
all, but in the end he sees only
chaos. He is excessively sell'-cen
tered, but you feel that lie should
not be otherwise.
Stepping into marriage without
a thought, be steps out with even
less a thought, lie lives a careless
life, wondering quite a lot, and
doing whatever comes into bis
head. He dies as he lives —by care
lessly drinking poison which he
thinks is a sedative.
The descriptions are marvelous in
their way. Consider this: "The
freshness of the morning, long
poised, became tarnished. The sun
stared rather too fixedly; its glit
ter was opaque. On the leaves of
trees it, was like a piece of gilt
paper glued 011."
The characters are likewise very
individual —like people you have
never met but would like to. Their
conversation is so remarkably
naive, so utterly without precedent
that when the only usual and pro
saic character is introduced, you
feel like skipping over to her exit,
and continuing from there.
This book has not received much
publicity. But altogether it is one
you should not miss. It will laugh
ar your criticisms, at the petty
trivialities in your own life —in fact

112 it will laugh in your fare. Hut from
the outset you will lie laughing
with it. —R. L.
CONEY ISLAND—By Homer Croy.
Harper and Brothers, New York,
1929. At The Alcove Bookshop.
You've read this story before.
Chic, Cotton comes to New York
"with high hope in his heart and
two suitcases to make his way in
the world." The author tries to tell
uh he is more or less of a ru~be who
• just naturally has a little luck;
however, the reader soon discovers
I that Chic knows how to spell his
own name. Underneath the thick
| coat of sentimentality which the
j author spreads freely, Chic is not
at all admirable. His brain is so
adept at rationalization that lie ex
cuses his mistakes almost before
he lias made them.
Chic, in moments of tenderness,
I gets himself engaged to two girls,
Chitrmian, the svelte product of
Bryn Mawl\ and Queenie, the wire
walker, rough and ready, whose
| surface vulgarity covers a heart of
gold one of these genuine people.
However, Queenie already has a
; daddy, Zimmerman, the controller
of Coney Island. You know what
happens next. Chic's giant top is a
;ll(<p; Zimmerman tells him what's
what; he leaves Queenie, and on
the last page, has just made a date
with Charmian, leaving the reader
: with the pleasant knowledge that
j everything will work out all right
in the end.
Mixed in with this charming dish
of applesauce is a lot of sentiment
al hooey about show folks. Just
about all of them are breaking
their hearts over something, and
imagine, the Bearded Lady, the in
telligent, the educated lady, who
could speak six languages and
looked down with scorn on every
one else, commits suicide, leaving
only the pathetic note which says
"i couldn't go on." Far be it from
ns to laugh at suicide, but Mr.
Croy's sent imentilization of the
scene ifc quite ridiculous.
In some respects, the author has
merely transplanted his "West of
the Water Tower" into a Coney
Island setting. Certainly the char
acter of the hero is the same in
all respects. Certain of the inci
dents are also very similar.
; We cannot criticize Mr. Croy for
using an old plot. There are only a
certain number of plots in the
world, and they must be used over
and over again. We can criticize
Mr. Croy for giving us a very
stereotyped treatment of an old
, plot. —L. R.
