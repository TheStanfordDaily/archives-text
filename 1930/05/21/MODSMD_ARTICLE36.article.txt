QUEENING AND LOCKOUTS

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford women feel that they
are being neglected and they don't
mind admitting it. They are jealous
of the imports who are trespassing
on what the Stanford woman con
siders her domain. Why does this
invasion take place? The question
is easily answered, and if the Stan
ford co-eds would only examine
their own attitude and position,
tliey would quickly see that they
themselves are at fault.
In ihe first place Stanford women
do not sho\y enough appreciation of
campus dances. An invitation to an
all-campus formal, is to them, just
another date, and most of them pre
fer to go dancing in the city. Such
sophistication is not becoming to
any woman and is not pleasing to
her es'cort.
Secondly, the small number of
campus co-eds who fulfill all the
qualifications of a good "date" are
either so busy or so haughty that
they insist on being asked to a
party at least a month ahead of
time. This is a thing a man bates
to do because very often his affec
tions change between the time lie
acquires the date and the night of
th event, and he then is tied up
with some girl who no longer inter
ests him.
Thirdly, the gossip travels so
fast on this campus that a man
who decides to go to a dance wit U

■in a week before it takes place
does not dare ask more than one
campus girl, because any other one
whom he asks is sure to learn that
she is second choice and thereupon
becomes much offended. If all Stan
ford women would do less brag
ging about dates they have refused,
they could mutually aid each other
to get more dates.
In the fourth place, after a man
has treated a girl to a big evening
lor which lie has had to make ex
tensive preparations he dislikes
very much to have to rush her
home immediately after the dance
i:; over. When the Stanford women
secure for themselves later lockout
(privileges they will undoubtedly
find that they are just as popular
i as imports and perhaps more so.
Ilesides these foregoing reasons
for the preference of imports to
campus women, there is one other
obstacle which Stanford co-eds must
; overcome, if they want to rate the
all-campus formals. This is, briefly,
the fact that very few fraternity
men attend these dances, and,
: since row men are the greatest
campus queeners, it naturally fol
lows that very few Stanford wo
men are invited to Junior Proms,
etc. It is up to the women to show
more interest in these social func
tions and thereby induce more fra
ternity men to attend them.
