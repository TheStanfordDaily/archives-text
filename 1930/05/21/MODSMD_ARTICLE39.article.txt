### Darrell Amyx 
BEFORE AN EXAM

I I gaze upon my shelf of books
Reflect ively;
'On this, on that one fall my looks
Successively.
! They all contain Important lore
i Of learned men:
The more I look at them the more
I 1 look again.
j
i Which one of Ihem contains the
right,
The needed dope?
' I'd flip a coin, but then chance
might
1 Destroy nil hope.
!
Such great decisions can't be made
Willi worried head;
So, with my conscious thus allayed,
I'll go to lied.
