EASTWARD, HO!
Horace Greeley's famous ad
vice will be thoroughly ignored
over this coming week-end
when three groups of young
men leave sunny California to
travel approximately 3,000
miles directly eastward. The
Mecca of these pilgrimages will
be Cambridge, Massachusetts,
where at least two of the three
aggregations are expected to
play leading parts in the fes
tivities planned for Friday and
Saturday, May 30 and 31.
Contrary to the statement made
in a headline in yesterday's Daily,
the Stanford outfit will not make i
the trip by airplane. Rather, the
more prosaic train will carry Coach
"Dink" Templeton's defending
champions hack to the stronghold
oi Puritanism.
Once again eastern track and
field luminaries will be forced
to sit back and watch two far
western institutions battle for
supremacy in the intercollegi
ate meet. No university entered
in the track classic appears
capable of smashing the rap
idly developing monopoly of
1.C.4-A. titles built up during
the past nine years by Califor
nia cinder artists.
Despite tlie lack of intersectional
flavor, however, the struggle for
first place should be sufficiently
violent to make the Second Battle
of the Marne appear by comparison
a mere disagreement. Featuring 1
this year's third and final conflict
between Stanford and Southern
California, the Cambridge meet will
probably be a continuation of the
record-breaking performances oc
curring each time Cardinal and Tro
jan have tangled.
Stanford is out for blood, re
venge, retribution, and vindica
tion. And if there is any truth
in the theory that the third
time is the charm, the blood
thirsty intentions of the Card
inal spikesters may well be
realized.
In fact, considering possibilities
from a purely cold, analytical stand
point, ii would appear that chances
of the Redshirts retaining their
title for the fourth consecutive
year are not at all bad. Even al
though automatically suspecting ul
terior motives behind any state
ment by the Trojan mentor, Gloomy
Dean Cromwell, we are inclined to
place considerable trust in his pre
diction that Stanford will down
Wykoff and his playmates at the
1.C.4-A. meet.
While determination and the
favorable mental attitude result
ing from being in the position
of defending champions play
their part in producing this
faith in Coach Templeton's
men, more substantial optim
ism arises from the presence
on the squad of those old re
liables—Captain Eric Krenz,
and Harlow Rothert. Seven
teen or eighteen certain points
from two entrants in the inter
collegiate meet will be hard for
even Southern California to
laugh off.
Add to these an indeterminate
number of digits, ranging any
wheres from 6 to 10, to be collected
by Hec Dyer, and at least 23 points
are credited to the Cardinals
through the efforts of only three
men. The somewhat wide range of
points credited to Dyer is the re
sult of the intrusion into the Wy
koff-Dyer feud of one Eddie Tolan,
colored Michigan speedster, who
holds the recognized world's 100-
vard dash record of 9,5 seconds.
Whatever other men Temple
ton sends East—and there will
be quite a few of them—are
bound to pick up their share of
the points. In fact, without any
straining of the imagination, it
is possible to chalk up 40
points for the Cards.
