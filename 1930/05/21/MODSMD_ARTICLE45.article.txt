# RUTH THROUGHOUT THE AGES
## Tournaments Were Easy for the Big Bambino in the Days of King Arthur (The Great) 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Sometime along between the fall
j of Rome and the first crusade, there
| lived a mighty King in Britain
i named Arthur (the Great). He had
! about a Thousand and One Knights,
the One being Launcelot Bambino,
the greatest warrior of his day and
I quite a man with the ladies. He
was good in both the wars and the
boudoirs. King Arthur (the Great)
had a round table, his wife, Queen
Guinevere, had a bridge table, while
Sir Mark, the court treasurer, had
a multiplication table.
"You can't play baseball on a
round table," suggested Launcelot
to the King one day, "there are no
corners to run to." "Well, how
about that big diamond you gave
Guinevere?" wisecracked Arthur.
"But, no matter," the King went
ion, "we'll have some tilting and
jousting." So he gave orders for
his court to be called together for
a tournament. "What is this about
: courts and tournaments? Tennis?"
asked Nick Altroiikolis the jester.
"And here our best tennis player,
Sir Galahad, is off on a trip in
quest of the Davis Cup." At which
Launcelot started singing to him
, self, "Oh, what a Gal-I-had!"
"Enough!" roared King Arthur,
the big airedale. "Go donneth that
suit of mail and prepare ye for the
'big battle!" So the Bambino, who
' always saved up his fan mail for
just, such an occasion, was soon
dressed for the Frey, who was, in
those days, Cincinnati's new rookie
right-handed pitcher. Launcelot's
'opponent in the first jousting match

was a bird named Sir Arrah j
Gawaine, of Ireland. The Bambino I
went into battle armed with only j
his trusty club, called "Louisville J
Slugger," and he hit Sir Gawaine |
such a sock on the potato with it I
that the Harp was knocked kicking j
over the fence and landed head i
first in a barrel of meal that stood j
by Bing the Miller's shop. At which j
Nick Alt rockolis took a deep
breath and then shouted, "Look, ye,
at the pretty tableau entitled
'When Knighthood Was in Flour!' "
