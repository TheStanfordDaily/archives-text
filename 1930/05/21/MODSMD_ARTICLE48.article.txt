# SECRET GRIDIRON WORK IS ORDERED BY "POP" WARNER
## Rumors Of Game Saturday With Olympic Club Prove False 
### 
Down behind the old green fence,
"Foxy Pop" Warner lias locked up
the gates to settle down to a cou
ple of weeks of secret practice.
From the meagre statements which
could be gleaned from the leaders
of Stanford's gridiron activities,
secret practice will continue from
now until the end of spring prac
t ice.
The rumor that the Cardinals
would tangle with the Olympic
Club eleven this Saturday in a
practice tilt was definitely spiked
by Coaches Thornhill and Winter
burn and Manager Mitchell. The
Redshirts, however, will probably
close the quarter's practice with a
regulation game between the first
and second strings. The closing
date has not been set, but will
probably be one week before the
start of final examinations.
