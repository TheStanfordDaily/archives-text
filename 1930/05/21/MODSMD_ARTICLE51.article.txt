# Juniors Win From '32 Tennis Squad In Interclass Tilt
## 
### 
With Forbes of the juniors de
feating Gledhill, sophomore star, in
the biggest upset of the meet, the
junior interclass tennis team cap
tured three out of four matches
played Monday afternoon to walk
off with the honors in its contest
with the sophmores by a 1-1 score.
G led hill's defeat by a 0-4, 0-1
count, was entirely unexpected
since he has ranked unofficially as
the most formidable player in Ihe
University and was doped to go
undefeated through the class tour
nament. Forbes' victory, while wel
come, was not essential for a jun
ior triumph, since he later teamed
with Met hen to down Williams and
Webb of the sophs in the second
doubles match, 0-2, 6-3, which, com
i billed with the 6-2, 5-7, 0-4 win of
Cox over Johnston in the thi-rd
singles was enough to insure vic
tory. Niederauer took the first
match for the juniors last week by
defeating Hickman.
Something of an upset also re
sulted in the first doubles tiit when
Johnston and Gledhill took the
measure of the veteran combina
tion of Cox and Niederauer by 4-0,
0-2, 0-4. This was the sophomores'
only win in the meet.
With the tournament half com
pleted the juniors have a consider
able lead, and should cop the title.
They have amassed a total of nine
points by virtue of their four wins
over the sophs ancl a clean sweep
of five matches against the fresh
men. Sophs and seniors each have
three digits, but tlie fourth-year
men have as yet played only one
contest. The freshmen trail with
none.
