### Alison Senders 
" 'A Mind that Found Itself,' an
autobiography by Clifford Beers,
stimulated the movement which
resulted in the Mental Hygiene
Congress which was held recently
in Washington," Dr. Walter Rich
ard Miles, professor of Experiment
al Psychology at Stanford, said in
an interview with the Daily yester
day. Dr. Miles returned Saturday
from a trip of live weeks, during
which time he attended the first
international congress in mental
hygiene.
"Mr. Beer's autobiography gained
immediate leading by a large pub
lic due principally to the fact that
it was introduced by a letter from
Professor William James of Har
vard," Dr. Miles said. Fifty-four na
tions were represented at the con
gress and speakers representing
six continents were heard at the
banquet which was held in the Wil
laid hotel on the first night of the
congress. Dr. William A. White,
noted American psychiatrist, pre
sided at the banquet.
Wilbur Speaks
"Secretary Wilbur gave tlie prin
cipal address. He placed mental hy
giene in its background as a bio
logical problem and referred to the
fact that man is the only creature
who cares for his weaklings and ill
adjusted members. The audience
was convulsed when lie said,
'There must be some dumb dogs
born, but unless they fall into the
laps of sentimental old women,
they haven't a chance in the
world.' "
Many Stanford people have been
thoroughly alive to problems of
mental hygiene. Dr. Terman was a
member of the advisory committee
on the program for the congress.
Dr. and Mrs. Miles were members
of the congress.
"Speaking as a laboratory psy
chologist." Dr. Miles concluded, "1
saw in this meeting very hopeful
signs of co-operative work by psy
chiatrists and psychologists for
dealing with these problems in the
future. Different groups of workers
are no longer as 'cocky' as they
used to be, but each is seeking help
from the other."
