## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 20. I/Pi Cliica
goans now may call police in seven
languages, which should facilitate
matters considerably.
Police 1313 is the number. If a
murder is being committed, and a
citizen desires to advise police of
the fact, hi' may do so in French,
Polish, Swedish, Yiddish, Italian,
or, if he prefers, English. The po- ,
lice operators who handle these
calls speak these languages fluent- '
ly, Captain G. F. Moran announced
today.
The busiest time on the police,
switchboard is Saturday and Sun
day nights, and the busiest hours
of the night are between 11 p.m.
and 1 a.m. Wednesday and Thurs
day nights are the most peaceful.
