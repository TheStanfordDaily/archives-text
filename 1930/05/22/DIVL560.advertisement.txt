The oven...
the c00k...
and the cake
"Only fine ovens produce calces of fine tex
ture." This rule applies as surely to the most
complicated "cake-baking" process in modern
industry . . . making steel castings tor high
pressures... as it does to the simplest domestic
cookery. In basic-lined Heroult electric fur
naces that apply the heat directly and cleanly
to the metal and permit exact control of tem
peratures at every stage, the steel for Crane
cast steel valves and fittings is prepared. Every
casting is annealed under temperatures held at
16oo° F. for hours, then slowly shaded off
to cooling. Interesting as is the Vulcan-like
O O
foundry equipment in Crane foundries, com
plete as arc the manufacturing resources that
give exactness and uniformity in production,
the vital secret back of quality in Crane electric
steel materials is not the "oven" but the skill of
the "cooks" . . . the chemists, the superintend
ents, the workmen who watch and control
each step and process. Through 75 years, this
skill has been developed and refined. Back of
it is an exhaustive scientific library of labora
-1 J
tory studies and test charts. Much of the data
that has enabled Crane Co. to produce depend
able valves for the enormous pressures and
temperatures now used in industry is collected
in a book, "Pioneering in Science." It is a valu
able reference book for students Let us send
you a copy.
