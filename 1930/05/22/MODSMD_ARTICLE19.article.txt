# LAPIERE COMPLETES LONG STUDY OF ARMENIAN COLONY IN FRESNO
## 
### 
Filially solving llie mystery of
the deep prejudice againsl (lie
Armenians of the colony in Fresno
county, Richard T. Lapiere, instruc
tor in economics, has just com
pleted a three-year study of their
eondit ions.
"Preceding and following the
Turkish massacres cf 1890 and
1 !>(>!»," stated Lapiere, "came the
Armenian emigrations to the
United States. At first settling on
the east coast around Massachu
setts, and entering mainly into tex
tile and leather industries, they
soon drifted westward to the farm
belts and eventually located in
Fresno county in California."
In the opinion of Lapiere, the
most interesting feature of this
study is the bitter prejudice which
the Armenians have drawn upon
themselves. They are blamed for
every untoward event not otherwise
accounted for.
"Careful study of their behavior
in the colony for the past three
years indicates that absolutely
none of the charges against tiie
Armenians are true," stated La

piere. lie further said that although
it is usually believed that racial
prejudice of this type is the out
come of economic conflict, in this
ease, the explanation is invalid. He
has found that Armenians, being
purely agriculturists, do not enter
into economic competition with
others of the colony.
"The explanation of the situation
can be found oTTiy in the attitudes
of the Armenians themselves -atti
tudes which they brought with
them from an atmosphere of terror
and persecution."
The instructor also remarked
upon the similarity between the
attitudes of non-Armenians toward
members of the Hebrew race. He
has found no biological relationship
between the Jews and the Armen
ians, yet the history of the two
peoples is very similar and they
are equally avoided by members of
other races.
The many interesting and hither
to unrecognized discoveries Lapiere
has made, have been developed Into
a treatise which will soon be placed
in the Stanford library.
