Senator Caraway quickly ob

which was widely interpreted as
expressing the opinion home brew
could be manufactured legally, and
read a portion of it.
He quoted Fort as saying in pari :
"Perhaps the act needs elarilica
t ion on the question of home brew,

But, otherwise, it seems to nie

poses of its adoption and to satisfy
the real wishes of the American
people—for the preservation of
their industrial system, their pros
perity, and their homes."
Commenting on the speech, Sam

"He says nobody had ever been
convicted for home brew, and they
ought to be content, if they want
beer, with what they made, if they
were not too lazy to make it."
