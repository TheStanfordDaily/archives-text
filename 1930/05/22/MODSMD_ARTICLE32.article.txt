# THE 						FIVE HUNDRED AGAIN

In thai amazing Daii.v column, reserved for campus opinion,
Slanford's womanhood has come in for a royal heating at the hands
<.112 the I 'Diversity's alleged stronger sex.
I nkind remarks have heen made concerning the 500's looks,
talents, poise, and democracy. \\ itli the women undergoing such a
period of stress and strain as this, the Daily has for several days
hesitated to stick its editorial nose into the situation.
I "or the Daily has found, in times past, that the editorial nose
comes in for a painful drubbing if it is inserted into the affairs of
womanhood at the wrong time.
I'.til the Daily cannot retrain longer- The editorial nose must
be risked.
What we want to say is simply this—
I he Daily has no bones to pick with the women on the scores
of hair dressing, laces, figures, democracy, or all-around niftiness.
It sets itsell up as no judge of charm and beauty.
And the I )aily agrees with the girls that those fellows are just a
bunch of nasty old meanies—those fellows who pick on Stanford's
lair sex for its so-called deficiency in the matters mentioned above.
I>ut we wonder why some of these "meanies" haven't taken the
women to task on an issue that seems to put the 500 in a position
where some criticism is justified.
\\ <• mean the matter of good, old-fashioned back-bone. Whether
ii is because of inherent sweetness or because of lackadaisical tend
encies, the fact remains that a leading characteristic of Stanford
women is their extreme reluctance to speak their minds.
In personal conversation one learns that women here on the
Kami are dissatisfied with many of their traditions and rules. Hut
will they speak out: will they take the necessary steps to rectify the
wrong
I liev will not. I '"or years now the women have decried (pri
vately) the lockout system; and only within the last.few weeks have
they worked up enough courage to make an attempt at doing some
thing about it. To date the desired end hasn't been reached, but
there are persons in certain circles who entertain hopes.
That is only one instance. There are others.
The 500 women of Stanford have adequate student government
machinery. They should utilize it thoroughly and fearlessly. I'.y
doing those things and bv having the courage of their convictions,
they can remove the one real cause for criticism.
So to them the Daily says —(lod bless you. but more power to
you.
