# LEARNING AT THE EXPENSE OF BEAUTY

( alilornia, supposed to be a leading state in the matter of public
education, surprised the world the other day with the extraordinarily
novel suggestion that all luxuries, including cosmetics and other
loilet preparations, he taxed by the state to provide money for
salaries of school teachers. I nder the terms of a proposed hill,
formulated by Kay Cloud, secretary of the California Congress of
Parents and 'Teachers, at the Riverside convention of the organi
zation. the State of California would apply a blanket tax to all
h-xuries sold.
Doubtless the women teachers using rouge, face powder, and
other so-called luxuries will look upon this proposal with disfavor.
Maybe their sisters in other occupations will frown upon Mr.
< loud's suggestion. More than like'v. the other sex will protest the
efforts of the association, l or, after all, these preparations go to
make the world much more beautiful -can they be luxuries when
this purpose is accomplished? x
School teachers deserve as much money as they can get. The
pedagogical profession is the primary foundation upon which the
country's success lies. However, to tax what seems to be a neces
sity more than a luxury is a bit far fetched. The age of luxury
may be called the age of necessity.
The question simmers down to this—do we want to sacrifice the
beauty engendered by lipstick and rouge on the altar of education?
No, a thousand times no! Anything but that.
I 'lit the tax on pretzels or shredded wheat biscuits if you must;
but remove not one iota of the beauty which brightens thi> dreary
• ild world of ours.
