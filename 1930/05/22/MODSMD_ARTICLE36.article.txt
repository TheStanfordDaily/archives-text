THE SCARAB MURDER CASE—A
Philo Vance Story. By S. S.
Van Dine. Scribners, New York.
1930.
The 1930 Philo Vance detective
story litis been released This week.
If you are one of those many
thousand devotees of Van Dine
murder mysteries, you will, of
course, quickly read it, despite
what this review lias to say one
way or another. For Van Dine has
raised himself in the minds of his
leaders to the pinnacle of "the best
living; writer of detective fiction,"
which no doubt he is.
In his new book the author will
still thrill the lovers of this type
of fiction; that large group of his
followers who do not like defective
stories but who read Van Dine be
cause of the unusual style lie af
fects will be greatly disappointed.
The realism and the educational
notes that be added to his previ
ous books with so much charm, the
marvelous vocabulary that gave
former novels a certain literary
quality become perfunctory in this
book. Van Dine is about to find out,
as so many noted writers h;ive
done, that an unusual style cannot
thrill the public, forever. And in
the "Scarab" case this style is
carelessly followed. An intelligent
reader, not greatly thrilled by the
marvelous accomplishments of the
amateur detective will object to
I he use of such a word as "leth
argy" four times in as many pages.
But. as a. mystery story it is good
—probably his greatest achieve
ment in that line. The plot, with
its exotic atmosphere, is baffling.
Briefly it is this, as given in the
pseudo-index of the New York po
lice. "Name: Kyle, Benjamin II.;
Murder: Skull crushed with a
statue. Body found in Illiss Museum
by Donald Scarlett." Then follows
a series of rapid and mystifying de
velopments that finally lead to the

' apprehension of the criminal.
As in his former tales the author
presents his facts as if they he
longed to an actual case; full j
charts of the rooms concerned, re- i
ports, and footnotes are given. The j
descriptions are good, hut you j
should have an unabridged diction- !
ary handy. A history of ancient
Egyptian history and hieroglyph
ics translations might also lie of
use.
But don't let nie disappoint you; j
read the hook and see for yourself, j
You will enjoy it.it. L.

THE ROGUE SONG—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Turning a picture show into a
j Metropolitan Opera performance
! has its dangers. But Lawrence Tib
liett transcends such minor fea
tures as dragging action, uneven
drama, and painted cardboard sets, i
lAs a matter of fact, the show is
all Tibbett. His voice is so magnifi
cent that even after he sings until
j you are under the impression that
I you are attending a musicale, you
still want to hear more, and never
begrudge him a single foot of film.
He doe's not have a tremendous
voice alone. Surprisingly, lie 'is an I
excellent, actor, and makes love to j
his haughty lady with super!) spirit :
and finesse.
I Laurel and Hardy are as good in j
this picture as t'liey are in their
| shorter comedies. This .means j
clowning I hat simply has no equal!
hut it also means that the general 1
n mnntic, highly dramatic tone of!
the picture is sacrificed. The spec- j
tacie of Laurel with a humble bee j
I somewhere on the inside of him, i
l and Hardy sitting on a razor, is |
excruciatingly funny and really!
good comic acting -yet the incon-j
giuity of this team in a production j
like the "Rogue Song" jars a little. ]
Catherine Dale Owen is beautiful, I
hut often artificial, and inclined to j
j strain al'ter effects.

For what profit, 1 ask, can pos
sibly accrue from all this childish '
mudslinging? Perhaps all Stanford
men are conceited, and all the
"crucified 500" are snobs, but what
of it? There is no very good reason
for letting the family skeleton out
of the closet for all the world to '
gape at. '
The whole trouble, of course (as
the women's editorial pointed out),
lies in the unfortunate prohibition
limiting the number of women to
500. From the standpoint of the
majority of the men, the situation
is akin to a horse with a tempting
bundle of hay tied ti inches from
his nose. Try as lie may, he just
can't seem to make the grade. For
the women, being so relatively few
in number, can be, and are rather
choosy and discriminatory, just as
we men would be if each of us had
a dozen young ladies angling for
our favor. As a result a good many
lads get turned down, and being
human, they get sort of irritated
and start taking out their wrath
by howling and panning the women,
and bringing along nice democratic
imports to campus affairs. Well,
this gets tlie girls riled and they
retaliate with a lot of unpleasant-I
ries and the battle is on. From this
unfortunate business, a tradition
has sprung up that our "500" are
snobs, homely, etc., etc. And it's
letters like the last two printed
that are fostering this unfair handi
cap saddled on our women. I sug
gest that hereafter the men shut
nj) and let the newcomers to Stan
ford draw their own conclusions as
to what the "500" are like. Let the
women of Stanford stand or fall
by their own merits, instead of
creating impressions in our frosh
and transfers that it may take
years to erase.
If the women are as bad as most
of us are given to believe before
we ever reach Stanford, they have
a hig enough burden to (tarry with
out our adding to their woes. No
body ever has much use for a man
who kicks another man or woman
who is down.
From now op i suggest a philo
sophical acceptance of the situa
tion by both sexes and, perhaps,
some day one of us will have 10
million to spare.
Sincerely, '27.
