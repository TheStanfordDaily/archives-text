The Editor, Sir:
The poor dears! I refer to the
"500." In all the time I have been
;i resident of the Farm (nearly four
years) 1 never until now felt that
anything appearing in the Daily
called for a reply from me. How
ever, this year's Women's Edition
has done just that.
One who claims to he experienced
in love, remarks that were Helen
Kane a Stanford co-ed she might
well sing with feeling, "If I Could
Find Him, The Right Kind Of
Man." That is a mistake, not Helen,
hut —if a co-ed were Helen it might
he appropriate. You see what I
mean.
Concerning how many men could
rate one of the "500," think hack
and try to remember how many
Stanford co-eds were at the Junior
Prom, the Encina Formal, the Mili
tary Ball, ete., etc. At the same
time remember who dragged the
co-eds that were at these functions.
Did they have the cream of the
loughs for escorts? Did they? Now
I ask you. Perhaps the average
height of the Stanford men who
date Stanford co-eds is 5 feet 3
inches; perhaps these same men
are not so hot. Do the co-eds here
presume to judge all of us men by
those who will date them? As one
dating Rollo (apologies to George
Ade) remarked, "I know two co-eds
to speak to; there aren't over a
half dozen more I would care to
speak to."
Concerning the "Five Easy Les
sons," ten or a dozen wouldn't do
most of the co-eds any harm. The
Whiskers? Well, growing whiskers
is practically the only thing we
men have left in which the women
do not emulate' us and I dare say
they would if they could.
In this same Women's Edition
there was a poem concerning the
Stanford Rough. The refrain de
clares, "He talks and acts and loves
like hell." Perahps it was just a
bit of pleasantry such as Mr. Amyx
sometimes indulges in, but if really
sounded like a dirty dig. Now ad
mitting that a co-ed haft the op
portunity to see how a rough talks
and acts, what could she know
about his loving? Did some one tell
her? She might I repeat might)
think she knows from experience
providing she she is one of those
fortunate ones(?) who have been
dated by roughs, but under the cir
cumstances leading to such experi
ence I feel confident that the rough
was not giving a medial perform
ance. He couldn't put his heart in
it, and what is more necessary to
love ?
A very competent cateress in
Polo Alto, who is much in demand
on the campus, once told me that
she would never think of sending
a daughter of hers to Stanford.
Said she, "The co-eds think they
are too closely supervised and bur
dened with rules. Well they de
serve them, they need discipline."
The lady undoubtedly knows much
more about the inside of the wo
men's living groups than any rough
can hope to. At the same time, so
far as most of us roughs are co'i
cerned. let the women be emanci
pated, let them come in at I or li

I The 10(1 ilor, Sir:
Although I have religiously re-
I trained from writing campus opin
j ion articles during the several years
, I have been in attendance at Stan-
I ford, the rather pointless diatribes
published in the last two editions
! have aroused a cautious as well as
j dormant pen to action.
The Editor, Sir:
The poor dears! I refer to the
"500." In all the time I have been
;i resident of the Farm (nearly four
years) 1 never until now felt that
anything appearing in the Daily
called for a reply from me. How
ever, this year's Women's Edition
has done just that.
One who claims to he experienced
in love, remarks that were Helen
Kane a Stanford co-ed she might
well sing with feeling, "If I Could
Find Him, The Right Kind Of
Man." That is a mistake, not Helen,
hut —if a co-ed were Helen it might
he appropriate. You see what I
mean.
Concerning how many men could
rate one of the "500," think hack
and try to remember how many
Stanford co-eds were at the Junior
Prom, the Encina Formal, the Mili
tary Ball, ete., etc. At the same
time remember who dragged the
co-eds that were at these functions.
Did they have the cream of the
loughs for escorts? Did they? Now
I ask you. Perhaps the average
height of the Stanford men who
date Stanford co-eds is 5 feet 3
inches; perhaps these same men
are not so hot. Do the co-eds here
presume to judge all of us men by
those who will date them? As one
dating Rollo (apologies to George
Ade) remarked, "I know two co-eds
to speak to; there aren't over a
half dozen more I would care to
speak to."
Concerning the "Five Easy Les
sons," ten or a dozen wouldn't do
most of the co-eds any harm. The
Whiskers? Well, growing whiskers
is practically the only thing we
men have left in which the women
do not emulate' us and I dare say
they would if they could.
In this same Women's Edition
there was a poem concerning the
Stanford Rough. The refrain de
clares, "He talks and acts and loves
like hell." Perahps it was just a
bit of pleasantry such as Mr. Amyx
sometimes indulges in, but if really
sounded like a dirty dig. Now ad
mitting that a co-ed haft the op
portunity to see how a rough talks
and acts, what could she know
about his loving? Did some one tell
her? She might I repeat might)
think she knows from experience
providing she she is one of those
fortunate ones(?) who have been
dated by roughs, but under the cir
cumstances leading to such experi
ence I feel confident that the rough
was not giving a medial perform
ance. He couldn't put his heart in
it, and what is more necessary to
love ?
A very competent cateress in
Polo Alto, who is much in demand
on the campus, once told me that
she would never think of sending
a daughter of hers to Stanford.
Said she, "The co-eds think they
are too closely supervised and bur
dened with rules. Well they de
serve them, they need discipline."
The lady undoubtedly knows much
more about the inside of the wo
men's living groups than any rough
can hope to. At the same time, so
far as most of us roughs are co'i
cerned. let the women be emanci
pated, let them come in at I or li
