New love, new love, you do not lie;
You 'tell tlic truth, I know.
Old love, old love, no use to try:
Your heart cannot be faithful,
though,
Perhaps, you wish it so.
Old love, I'm waiting day by day,
Knowing that you will pass.
You, love are not the kind to stay, (
And some day soon you'll flit away,
Mendacious, heartless lass!
New love, you never will deceive,
You could not, if you would;
Is it because you too have stood
For lies you wanted to believe? j
Is that why you're so good?
New love ,new love, you do not lie;
Old love, old love, no use to try!
You both are false, I know.
No longer can you fool me: I
See now, you both must go.
