SOME LONG DISTANCE
PROGNOSTICATING
Upon the third meeting of a
quintet of broad-jumpers and a
similar clash with four javelin
tossers participating may hang
the track and field champion
ship of the 1.C.4-A., to be con
tested on May 30 and 31 at
Cambridge. And strangely
enough, the University of Cali
fornia, which will be nothing
but an interested spectator as
far as titular aspirations are
concerned, will probably have a
large finger in the pie that
Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia are eyeing avidly.
Briefly, the situation is this: The
Cards and the Trojans are copper
riveted certainties to light it out for
the championship, and each of tlieni
can virtually cede themselves,
without any undue misgivings, some
25 points before the meet starts,
with each possessing enough poten
tial strength to stretch its total
to 4(», given tile breaks. Stanford,
with Rothert, Krenz, and Dyer, lias
approximately 25 digits of which
nothing short of a court order could
deprive her. (JSC is in a similar
position with Wykolf in the hun
dred, Van Osrlel in the high jump,
Hall in the weights, and Welsh,
Carls, and Payne in the hurdles.
Stanford, with any sort of luck,
can pick up from 5 to 15 points
with Smith, Morrison, Hables,
Merry, Giherson, Howell, Grey, and
Fleishhacker, and the Trojans can
<lo the same with McGeagh, llal
stead, Hansen. Maurer, Livingston,
Hubbard, and Stewart. Which
brings us back to the original dis
cussion the broad jump and the
javelin.
Dowell, West, and Butler
will enter the broad jump for
Stanford; Paul and Barber will
compete for USC. ( Each and
every one of these five is capa
ble of winning the event. The
Trojans finished one-two in the
Card-Trojan dual meet; Tem
pleton's men swept the first
three places in the event,last
Saturday at the California In
tercollegiates. It is not too
much to expect at least three,
possibly all five, of these men
to be in the money at Cam
bridge. The order in which they
finish can mean from 3 to 10
points for their respective
team.
The javelin will find four ath
letes from the Golden State favored
to annex the first four places, name
ly, Curtice and Churchill of Cali
fornia, and Mortensen and Snider
of Southern California. Snider, who
cannot come within five feet of Mor
tensen's best mark, bested the two
Hears in the Cal-I'SC dual meet;
the latter shoved the Trojan pair
into third and fourth place at the
California Intercollegiates. The
outcome of the third meeting at
Cambridge may have a lot to do
with the ultimate victor about five
points' worth, to hazard a guerts.
Of course, the uncertain perform
ances registered by runners from
l lie western slope at past Eastern
meets, coupled with the season's
upsets here, may render any such
forecasting as this absolutely ridi
culous. Morrison and Hables, on
their records this year, can easily
finish one-two in the quarter, but
how much the trip and the un
familiar conditions will affect them
is a matter for conjecture. What
will Podge Smith do in the hurdles?
Will McGeagh, Halstead, and Han
sen cut any figure at all?
But allowing each squad an
equal number of breaks, it is
possible that the two teams
will come to the broad jump
and javelin practically even.
And then???

Card-Trojan dual meet; Tem
pleton's men swept the first
three places in the event,last
Saturday at the California In
tercollegiates. It is not too
much to expect at least three,
possibly all five, of these men
to be in the money at Cam
bridge. The order in which they
finish can mean from 3 to 10
points for their respective
team.
The javelin will find four ath
letes from the Golden State favored
to annex the first four places, name
ly, Curtice and Churchill of Cali
fornia, and Mortensen and Snider
of Southern California. Snider, who
cannot come within five feet of Mor
tensen's best mark, bested the two
Hears in the Cal-I'SC dual meet;
the latter shoved the Trojan pair
into third and fourth place at the
California Intercollegiates. The
outcome of the third meeting at
Cambridge may have a lot to do
with the ultimate victor about five
points' worth, to hazard a guerts.
Of course, the uncertain perform
ances registered by runners from
l lie western slope at past Eastern
meets, coupled with the season's
upsets here, may render any such
forecasting as this absolutely ridi
culous. Morrison and Hables, on
their records this year, can easily
finish one-two in the quarter, but
how much the trip and the un
familiar conditions will affect them
is a matter for conjecture. What
will Podge Smith do in the hurdles?
Will McGeagh, Halstead, and Han
sen cut any figure at all?
But allowing each squad an
equal number of breaks, it is
possible that the two teams
will come to the broad jump
and javelin practically even.
And then???

Upon the third meeting of a
quintet of broad-jumpers and a
similar clash with four javelin
tossers participating may hang
the track and field champion
ship of the 1.C.4-A., to be con
tested on May 30 and 31 at
Cambridge. And strangely
enough, the University of Cali
fornia, which will be nothing
but an interested spectator as
far as titular aspirations are
concerned, will probably have a
large finger in the pie that
Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia are eyeing avidly.
Briefly, the situation is this: The
Cards and the Trojans are copper
riveted certainties to light it out for
the championship, and each of tlieni
can virtually cede themselves,
without any undue misgivings, some
25 points before the meet starts,
with each possessing enough poten
tial strength to stretch its total
to 4(», given tile breaks. Stanford,
with Rothert, Krenz, and Dyer, lias
approximately 25 digits of which
nothing short of a court order could
deprive her. (JSC is in a similar
position with Wykolf in the hun
dred, Van Osrlel in the high jump,
Hall in the weights, and Welsh,
Carls, and Payne in the hurdles.
Stanford, with any sort of luck,
can pick up from 5 to 15 points
with Smith, Morrison, Hables,
Merry, Giherson, Howell, Grey, and
Fleishhacker, and the Trojans can
<lo the same with McGeagh, llal
stead, Hansen. Maurer, Livingston,
Hubbard, and Stewart. Which
brings us back to the original dis
cussion the broad jump and the
javelin.
Dowell, West, and Butler
will enter the broad jump for
Stanford; Paul and Barber will
compete for USC. ( Each and
every one of these five is capa
ble of winning the event. The
Trojans finished one-two in the
Card-Trojan dual meet; Tem
