# DAILY WRITER PICKS JOHNNY HUNKEN AS FIELDER ON ALL-CONFERENCE NINE
## 
### BY HOWARD MOORE 
Going on the supposition that
most journals chose an all-State
team as soon as an athletic season
is over, the Daily forthwith names
a mythical baseball aggregation.
The Conference champion Trojans
have two men on an all-star team
of twelve, California, runner-up for
the title, has four men, three come
from St. Mary's, and one each from
Stanford and I'.C.L.A.
For catcher, Captain Joe Ward
of Troy is picked for the first team
for his ability to hit, his almost
flawless fielding, and bis leadership.
Joe Smith of California gets the
call for the second team by a slight
margin oyer Spud Hardy of Stan-

Clara.
In choosing three pitchers for the
mythical "nine," Red Conlan and
Norm Horner are included with the
third a toss-up between Sutherlen
and Williamson of S.C.
Armand Seghetti of the Gaels is
probably the best first-sacker in the
circuit, followed by Garret Arbel
bide of U.S.C. Loth are heavy hit
ters,, but Seghetti is the better in
the field.
Captain John Valianos of the
Hears is the Daily's choice for
guardian of the keystone hag, and
Captain Jimmy Leyh of U.C.L.A.
looks to be in second place, al
though Captain-elect. Swede Harper
of Santa Clara runs him a close
race.
Had Captain Bill Laird of Stan
ford been in the game all year,

I there would have been no difficulty
i in naming a third sucker to play
with the pick of the crop, but as
I it is, Captain-elect Harry Butler of
California gets first call followed
j by Jaqua of the Broncos.
For shortstop, Mill Hrubaker of
the' Bruins is chosen. The I'.C.L.A.
infielder shines on a rather weak
team and is noted as a steady
1 fielder an<l a hard hitter. Neeley
of St. Mary's is second choice by a
, narrow squeak over Johnson of the
Redshirts and Swenson of Califor
nia.
Captain-elect Johnny Hunken of
Stanford is considered the best
fielder in the -Conference as well as
the best left fielder, although
Heihie Glaister of the Bears and
Jesse Hill from Troy are classy
performers.
Fred Stenett, Gael captain-elect,
is the pick of the centerfielders,
while Rudy Rintala of the Cards,
Bob Gaddy, Santa Clara, and Ed
Kirwan, California, are also good
men.
There is an unusual id earth of
good rightfielders this year, but
Mill Burgett of Berkeley gets first
call followed by Harry Berg, right
fielder, third-baseman, second-base
| man, and general handy man of the
Cardinal squad.

good rightfielders this year, but
Mill Burgett of Berkeley gets first
call followed by Harry Berg, right
fielder, third-baseman, second-base
| man, and general handy man of the
Cardinal squad.
Going on the supposition that
most journals chose an all-State
team as soon as an athletic season
is over, the Daily forthwith names
a mythical baseball aggregation.
The Conference champion Trojans
have two men on an all-star team
of twelve, California, runner-up for
the title, has four men, three come
from St. Mary's, and one each from
Stanford and I'.C.L.A.
For catcher, Captain Joe Ward
of Troy is picked for the first team
for his ability to hit, his almost
flawless fielding, and bis leadership.
Joe Smith of California gets the
call for the second team by a slight
margin oyer Spud Hardy of Stan-

In choosing three pitchers for the
mythical "nine," Red Conlan and
Norm Horner are included with the
third a toss-up between Sutherlen
and Williamson of S.C.
Armand Seghetti of the Gaels is
probably the best first-sacker in the
circuit, followed by Garret Arbel
bide of U.S.C. Loth are heavy hit
ters,, but Seghetti is the better in
the field.
Captain John Valianos of the
Hears is the Daily's choice for
guardian of the keystone hag, and
Captain Jimmy Leyh of U.C.L.A.
looks to be in second place, al
though Captain-elect. Swede Harper
of Santa Clara runs him a close
race.
Had Captain Bill Laird of Stan
ford been in the game all year,

I there would have been no difficulty
i in naming a third sucker to play
with the pick of the crop, but as
I it is, Captain-elect Harry Butler of
California gets first call followed
j by Jaqua of the Broncos.
For shortstop, Mill Hrubaker of
the' Bruins is chosen. The I'.C.L.A.
infielder shines on a rather weak
team and is noted as a steady
1 fielder an<l a hard hitter. Neeley
of St. Mary's is second choice by a
, narrow squeak over Johnson of the
Redshirts and Swenson of Califor
nia.
Captain-elect Johnny Hunken of
Stanford is considered the best
fielder in the -Conference as well as
the best left fielder, although
Heihie Glaister of the Bears and
Jesse Hill from Troy are classy
performers.
Fred Stenett, Gael captain-elect,
is the pick of the centerfielders,
while Rudy Rintala of the Cards,
Bob Gaddy, Santa Clara, and Ed
Kirwan, California, are also good
men.
