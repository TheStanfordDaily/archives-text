# COUGAR NINE PLAYS DECIDING CONTESTS

### 
PULLMAN, Wash., May 21.
(P.1.P.)-â€”With five conference tilts
billed for this week, the Washing
ton State diamond pastimers will
either find themselves has-beens or
championship contenders at the end
of the week's engagements.
The Cougars are now at the
fourth rung of the conference
ladder, with Washington, Oregon,
and Oregon State ahead, Idaho is
just a step below, having lost all its
conference starts. If the Cougars
continue their hitting spree that
was so noticeable during the Idaho
series last Monday and Tuesday,
the pennant chase in the northern
division of the Pacific Coast con
ference will undergo a decided
shake-up.
