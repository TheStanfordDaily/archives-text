# SEQUOIA IS ONLY HALL TO OPERATE OWN CIGAR STORE
## Shop Is Profitless But It Excels As Men's Social Center 
### 
Sequoia Hall, famous for the axe
reprisal raid and the stalwart, twen
ty-one, has another claim to fame.
It alone of the halls possesses a
store of its own, operated by and
for the residents of the dormitory,
and known by the alliterative name
of the Sequoia Cigar Store.
The little shop (for it is only
eight by eight feet in size) is lo
cated on tin' first floor by the doors
of the dining room, and in spite of
its name carries practically every
thing but cigars. Ice cream, candy,
cigare ttes, drugs, chewing gum, and
soap comprise its stock, and if the
Sequoia rough needs a shave, he
may even find some razor blades
1 here.
Since the store is owned by stu
dents, it is the only refreshment
emporium on the campus run on
the unhandy system, and is open
in the afternoon and evening.
Founded in the dark ages, the
date unrememhered by the oldest
inhabitant, the store has passed
through the hands of many owners,
all of whom have regretfully been
convinced at the end of their own
ership that the shop is essentially
a non-profit organization.
As a social center, the store is
without peer, and the night-life of
the hall centers about its counter
front !• until 10:30 every evening.
Sunday night, when the eating club
is closed, the store does a banner
business, otherwise the trade is
largely confined to ice cream cones
and candy bars.
