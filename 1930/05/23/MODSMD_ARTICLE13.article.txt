# B.A.C. REFUSES TO GRANT FURTHER APPROPRIATIONS FOR NEW WOMEN'S GYM
## Rothâ€™s Request Is Turned Down Because of Financial Inability of Board; Dyment Disappointed; States Present Plans Are Incapable of Reduction 
### 
Refusing by a practically unanimous vote the proposal that the Hoard of
Athletic Control appropriate a stun sufficient to complete the proposed new
women's gymnasium in accordance with the present architects' plans, the
Hoard went on record last night as feeling itself financially unable to con
tribute any additional funds toward the proposed building.
When informed last night of the action of the Board, Dr. Bertha Dyment,
women's medical adviser, said, "The plan has already been cut down to the

Hast possible limit, and unless a small
| it building is erected 1 don't see how
the plans can be changed."
"We have already gone over the
present plans and cut down on ev
erything possible. If anything more
must be eliminated the building will
not be worth constructing. If new
contracts are necessary it will mean a
pc of at least six months, I
have been given to understand. I am
very disappointed."
The request for the appropriation
was made for the University by Comp
troller Almon F. Roth. He sent a
| telegram to the Board last night urg
i ing that the low contractor's bid ob
tained be utilized by granting the re
quest, and saying that lie saw no
other means by which the necessary
money could be obtained.
In a letter to the Hoard, Roth stated
that tlie present plans in full call for
a total expenditure of $287,521, but
the elimination of cue swimming pool
and a change in the filtration system
I would cut the cost to $267,601. He
| asked the Board to donate the diffcr-
I cncc between this sum and the origi
| nal $225,000 already appropriated.
The chic i reason for the Board's ac
| lion as discussed by the members was
I the fact that any additional donation
j would throw out of line and delay
| the ten-year building program which
; i> now under way. According to Grad
! uate Manager A! Masters, the hu'ild
| ing program is already approximately
1 $65,000 behind, and the gift of $25,000
to $-10,000 more would force the aban
donment of some phase of the build
ing.
The opinion was expressed by mem
bers that a satisfactory gymnasium
could be built for $225,000, and that
the extra features for which the ad
ditional funds are asked could be
postponed and included gradually after
a few years. It was also felt that the
per capita expenditure (about $450)
on the women's gymnasium would be
out of proportion to the smaller
amount on the Fncina Gym.
In favor of the appropriation it
was mentioned that the fully carried
out plans would create a very fine
structure. The difficulty and expense
of changing the plans and contract
bids was another factor considered.
'fed Faston and Larry Mali, Pacific
( < ast Intercollegiate doubles tennis
champions, were granted a trip to the
National Intercollegiate fournamcut
iu Philadelphia in the latter part of
June. Other business considered by
the Board was the Big Game ticket
situation, decision on which was post
j poiierl until next year, and the ques
tion oi refunds on golf course scrip.
It was decided that refunds would be
made on a basis of deducting the
| straight green tee lor each round
played on the scrip.
