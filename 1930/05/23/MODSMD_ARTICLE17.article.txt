PERNAMBI'CO, Brazil, May 22.
(/P) â€”Flying over the route of the
Spanish Crtnqul&tadores, tin- dirigi
ble Graf Zeppelin for tlie first, time
crossed the equator and made her
bow to the southern hemisphere
tonight.
Garnished with new transatlan
tic laurels, the world-circling air
ship reached the southern side of
the New World just before the
tropic twilight set in.
At 7:10 p.m. her ropes fluttered
to the ground, where they were
seized by Brazilian soldiers form
ing tin: newly trained ground crew.
Amid a furious din from thousands
of spectators and a bedlam of
horns and sirens, she was snugly
tied ni> to her specially built moor
ing mast.
Northern Brazil was delirious
with excitement over the Graf's
newest achievement tonight.
Pernambueo hailed her arrival
with furious blasts of sirens and
whistles from factories and ships.
People swarmed out of their homes
to point at the strange shining
shape in the tropic skies. The
streets were choked with shouting,
gest iculat ing people.
Over the city and the harbor,
about 1,000 feet aloft, the majestic
silver bullet gracefully sailed. At
6:80 p.m. she circled over Campo
Giquia, the landing field, and then
glided down through the dusk to
ward the mooring mast.
