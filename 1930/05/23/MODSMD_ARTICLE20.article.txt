j ject to an end.
Making it clear that he was speak- ;
| ing as a former governor general of
the islands and not as Secretary of !
j State, Stimson said the Uawcs-Cut
ij ting bill to provide complete hide- ;
| pendence to the Philippines in pro- |
gressive stages through a live-year ;
i period allowed too little time for the
! Filipinos to learn to "stand alone" ,
j politically and economically.
