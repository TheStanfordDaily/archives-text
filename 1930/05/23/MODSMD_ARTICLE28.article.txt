\\ ith the firm intention of winning,

championship, Coach "Dink" Temple
tun and IX Cardinal track men will

o'clock bound for Cambridge, Massa

will accompany the team.
Incidental to the matter of win
ninn their fourth championship, a leat
never yet accomplished by a Western
university, the Cards are highly inter
cstcd in downing their deadly rivals,
the Southern California Trojans, who
appear most likely to upset the Stan
ford applecart in the intercollegiate
meet. A decision over Dean Crom
well's outfit at Cambridge, carrying
with it the prestige of a national
championship, would retrieve much of
the glorv lost by the Rcdshirts in the
two times these teams have dallied
so far this year.
A final workout on home ground
will be held by I cmplcton's men thi~
afternoon at 2 o'clock on the practice
oval. I his will be the last opportunity
lor the Stanford spikesters to do more
than stretch their legs until they ai
rive in ( hicago Monday morning. \r
rangeincnts have been made for a
workout to be held sometime Monday
at Soldiers' Field, Chicago.
Leaving the Windy City Mondav
night, tile Cards will arrive in Boston
early Tuesday afternoon. Their tin
v\ill rest and acclimate themselves to
I'.a stern weather conditions until Fri
day when preliminary trials will be
held at Cambridge.
Immediately following the finals of
the meet on Saturday, May .51, the
Stan lord squad will pack up and grab
the night train for San Francisco,
