						DEAD ISSUE

### 
A communication in today's Campus ()pinion column raises
attain an issue which many had hoped would die on this campus
along with fondness for peg-topped trousers and mustache cups. It
i-' the Row-I Jail-Independent issue—a relic of the days when fresh
nan discipline, senior sombreros, and two-inch beards were popular.
I he writer of this communication, who signs himself "Inde
pendent 11 all Man. uses partisan phraseology to lire broadsides at
both the so-called "Row" and"Club" factions.
I le hurls the horrid charge at the clubs that they are nothing but
fraternities under the surface. Me calls Stanford fraternity houses
barns (which comes pretty close to the truth, at that ).
"Independent I lall Man" declares in no uncertain terms that his
group is through being "bluffed" and "blindfolded." "Thev are
opening their eyes," he says,"and they are voting for the most pro
gressive candidate."
In that last sentence, the writer utters an admirable sentiment.
\ oting for the most progressive candidate is a practice which should
be universally followed by "Row" men and"Club" men along with
the "Independents."
lint that sentence contains about all the merit to be found in the
letter. The whole diatribe (with the above-mentioned exception)
>eems singularly out oi place in this day of broad-mindedness in
campus politics. It reflects a tradition which cannot die too soon.
Almost anyone will admit that political sectionalism on the
I-'arm is not entirely gone. I Hit there is irrefutable evidence that it
b fast passing. For many years a Club man occupied the position
of student body president. And no one on the Row was deeply
disturbed.
This spring the traditional order of things was upset when a
fraternity man won the presidency. I'ut in spite of that no wide
spread concern is evidenced in the clubs.
In other words, Stanford has progressed to jthe point where the
questions of affiliation and lack of affiliation mean increasingly
little. Standards other than those of fraternity and club are con
sidered in vote casting.
That is well. May the practice continue.
"Independent Mall Man" is sponsoring a dead cause. Me will
do well to quit his political arm-waving and direct his attention
exclusively to "voting for the most progressive candidate."
