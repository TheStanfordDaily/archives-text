# ANOTHER VIEW ON LOCKOUTS
## 
### 
I hose who believe that the present agitation against lockout
regulations is something new should peruse back tiles of this news
paper.
I*or instance, on .Monday, May J3, 1927, the Daily carried an
interview with Dr. Margery I'ailey. In that interview Dr. Bailey
discussed the very situation which has brought about the present
furor.
Ilecausc the <|iiestion is again of general interest, and because
Dr. Bailey's remarks were (and still are) remarkably apt, the Daily
reprints certain excerpts from her statements.
"The women of the I 'niversity | she said | should abolish rules
which both the men and the women of Stanford know to be lit
only for the government of little girls, and which are moreover the
cause of constant annoyance and ill feeling, and the opportunity of
;t great deal of that small tyranny which is inseparable from the
administration of petty rules . . . Somebody must begin and carry
through a means of making the rules governing the life of the
women on the campus more consistent and more sensible than they
are now, in an effort, to demonstrate the equality of women with
men. The women not long ago insisted on being allowed to smoke
freely. This was a pitiful move toward independence—asserting
the right to practice a petty habit—and in the minds of many
persons go >o far to prove what the critics say of co-education have
said ..."
The above is only a small part of Dr. Bailey's very able dis
cussion of the situation. I ler remarks were pertinent in \ ( )27. And
they are pertinent todav.
