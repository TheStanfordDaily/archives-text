The Editor, Sir:
In the past few days there lius
been considerable undeserved criti
cism directed toward independent
hall men who voted for so-called
"row" candidates in the recent elec
tions. The truth is, that, in most
campus elections, independent hall
men must choose between two
groups of "row" candidates. One '
is the Greek letter "row." The
other is the Eating club-fraternity
"row" located between Toyon and
Eneina and it is composed of a
group of pseudo-fraternities mas
querading under Spanish and other
names. In voting, one must choose
between candidates from one row
or the other. Independent, candi
dates are as numerous its "hen's
teet.h." The independent hall men
are through being bunked by those
Club-fraternity politicians. They
, vote in the best interests of Stan
ford.
It is high time that the Adminis
tration put this group of camou
flaged' fraternities in their proper
classification, Unit is, in the same
class as the Creek letter houses.
They should be made to join the

1 Interi'raternity Council, obey rush
ing rules, etc. li is also highly de
p.ireable that they be given sepa
rate living quarters in barns sucli
as the other fraternities occupy in
stead of being given exclusive pos
session of the best dormitory on
the campus.
The "Hall Caucus" has depreci
ated into a "rat race" where a few
of these Eating-fraternity poliii
cians dominate, nominate, and con
trol, collecting carefully a majority
of ballots favorable to them. In this
way candidates from the Club-fra
ternities' row are put up to op
pose candidates from the Lasuen
row. Then then have the intestinal
fortitude .to call these 1 rat-brothers
of theirs, "ball" candidates, and ex
pect the ball men's support.
The independent ball men are
opening their eyes and they are
voting for the most progressive
candidates. They can no longer be
bluffed or blindfolded by the Club-
I'rats. Mail to (lie Independent llall
Men. They are for Stanford 100';/,.
They proved ibis iti recovering the
Axe. Sincerely,,
Independent Hall Man.
