# A 						QUESTION OF DUCATS

### 
The lOd it or, Sir:
Of course I realize that it such
i a time as this, with the charm of
I co-eds and the publishing of syllabi
in the air, my letter is entirely
out of place, but nevertheless I am
terribly worried about Big Game
tickets. 1 read in the papers re
cently that the classification for;
the allotment of tickets has been
changed. In tlie past, students have
been allowed one rooter's ticket
and two general tickets to the Big
Game, and these two general tick
ets have been in a preferred classi
! fication above that of the members
of the alumni association. This
year, though, the arrangement has J

been changed so llinl (lie alumni
come before the students in the
allotment ol' those two general
tickets.
Now when that change was made
at Herkeley, the students ceased
to get more than their one rooter's
ticket apiece. Of course, the Cal
alumni body is much larger than
Stanford's, but what I am fright
fully anxious to know is whether
the new classification will bring
about the same result here. in
other words, is the suggestion made
last fall that students be allowed
one rooter's ticket and no other
tickets whatsoever to be carried
out by this means?
