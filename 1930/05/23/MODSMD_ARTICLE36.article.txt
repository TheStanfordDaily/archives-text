# "A WORD OF EXPLANATION"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A word of explanation about the
| time questionnaires sent out Mon
day night.
It was felt by some that Wednes
day's editorial implied that the re
sults of the questionnaire would be
used in connection with the pres
ent discussion on "Women's Social
Freedom." The questionnaires are
: the final step of the Time Survey
that the Y.W.C.A. has been carry
ing on throughout the Winter and
Spring quarters. While the results
, will be used in connection with

! wasted time, they will have noth
ing to do with a solution to the
present lockout question.
May I say, too, that of necessity
"each angle" of all sides must be
gone into by the A.W.S. committee
which is earnestly trying to find
"some feasible plan for lockout re
vision" ?
In a situation of this kind the
easiest tool to use is sarcasm, but
has sarcasm a place in an editorial
and does it help in solving this
problem that is importantâ€”if try
ing? Sincerely,
i Betty Alden.
