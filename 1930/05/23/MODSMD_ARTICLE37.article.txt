DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY. By
Walter Ferris. Samuel French,
New York. 1930.
For many people, plays are rath
er dull reading, ll would seem that
; the interpretation of actors, direc
tor, and scenic artist, is necessary
for enjoyment.. Yet, I defy you to
j i< ad the first act of "Death Takes
i a Holiday" and then put the hook
down. So unusual is its situation,
so intense is its philosophy, that
you will read eagerly to the finish.
The plot, almost without prece
dent in dramatic literature, con
tains all those requisites of a good
play. Death, in this case the not-too
j grim reaper, decides to take a
three-day holiday, suspending all
his activities for that period. He
wishes to find out why men fear
him so.
During this holiday lie takes the
form of a mortal, joins a house*-

party in Italy. Through the medium
of a beautiful girl. Death discovers
Love and finds in it a power that
exceeds hisj own: "So . , . Again
1 I am caught by my own folly. I
gave myself life, not knowing the
I force that is in life, nor the force
that is in love. I gave myself life,
and with it the little rules by which
it is lived. And now, I, Death, must
bow to life. What a sublime
joke . . . What a monstrous and
' bitter comedy."
The philosophy is of the quasi
optimistic type. It looks beyond
the trivialities of fife, and sees in
death a certain restfulness: "Death
may be a high adventure, a mag
nificent discovery, a glorious free
dom . . . Death may be only sim
pler than life, and infinitely more
kind." But, the technique of the
play prevents this philosophy from
"hitting you in the face."
"Death Takes a Holiday" is now
i being presented at the Ethel Barry
more theatre in New York with
Philip Merivale in the title role. It
' is creating quit a stir. In book form
the play is equally engaging. You
, will forget the trite theme in the
I unique situation.
If you wish an enjoyable two
hours, by all means get it.

gave myself life, not knowing the
I force that is in life, nor the force
that is in love. I gave myself life,
and with it the little rules by which
it is lived. And now, I, Death, must
bow to life. What a sublime
joke . . . What a monstrous and
' bitter comedy."
The philosophy is of the quasi
optimistic type. It looks beyond
the trivialities of fife, and sees in
death a certain restfulness: "Death
may be a high adventure, a mag
nificent discovery, a glorious free
dom . . . Death may be only sim
pler than life, and infinitely more
kind." But, the technique of the
play prevents this philosophy from
"hitting you in the face."
"Death Takes a Holiday" is now
i being presented at the Ethel Barry
more theatre in New York with
Philip Merivale in the title role. It
' is creating quit a stir. In book form
the play is equally engaging. You

I unique situation.
If you wish an enjoyable two
hours, by all means get it.

DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY. By
Walter Ferris. Samuel French,
New York. 1930.
For many people, plays are rath
er dull reading, ll would seem that
; the interpretation of actors, direc
tor, and scenic artist, is necessary
for enjoyment.. Yet, I defy you to
j i< ad the first act of "Death Takes
i a Holiday" and then put the hook
down. So unusual is its situation,
so intense is its philosophy, that
you will read eagerly to the finish.
The plot, almost without prece
dent in dramatic literature, con
tains all those requisites of a good
play. Death, in this case the not-too
j grim reaper, decides to take a
three-day holiday, suspending all
his activities for that period. He
wishes to find out why men fear
him so.
During this holiday lie takes the
form of a mortal, joins a house*-

party in Italy. Through the medium
of a beautiful girl. Death discovers
Love and finds in it a power that
exceeds hisj own: "So . , . Again
1 I am caught by my own folly. I
gave myself life, not knowing the
I force that is in life, nor the force
that is in love. I gave myself life,
and with it the little rules by which
it is lived. And now, I, Death, must
