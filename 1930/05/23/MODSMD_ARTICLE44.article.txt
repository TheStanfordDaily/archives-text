Feeling that it would be
downright ungrateful to ac
cept a free ride all the way
to the Atlantic coast and back
to compete in only one meet,
Stanford's mighty weight
twins, Captain Eric Krenz and
the illustrious Harlow Ro
thert, have accepted an invi
tation to represent Stanford
at the N.C.A.A. meet to be
held in Chicago June 6 and 7.
liotli Hi these by n«»\v internation
ally famous track stars have, by dint
•it bard work and intense concentra
tion, completed their scholastic work
for this quarter and may without dan
ger to their chances of acquiring a
lurpskin, tarry in the kast while
their teammates are speeding home
ward. Stamps of approval placed on
the project b\ both the baculty Ath
letic ( onunittce and the Board o!
Athletic Control make the venture
thoroughly official.
Applying the formula of the
law of supply and demand, it
would appear that the abilities
of Messrs. Krenz and Rothert
are of considerable value. And
that such should be the case
is no particular surprise, for
whenever either lets fly with
his favorite toy, a brand new
world's record is likely to be
written down on the books.
Already the International Am
ateur Athletic Federation finds
difficulty in meeting often
enough to keep up with Cap
tain Krenz's latest mark.
Credit for the remarkable develop
ment of these two shot and discus
experts may well be apportioned in
two shares. Hard work, stick-to-it
iveness, determination, and being kind
to their mother* is undoubtedly re
sponsible for a large measure of the
Cardinal weightmcn's success, lint at
least half the credit belongs to Coach
"Dink" Templeton, master mind of
Western track mentors, whose knowl
edge of proper form and whose per
sistence in making his pupils observe
his precepts have pushed more than
one athlete from mediocrity into the
championship class.
Krenz's progress in the dis
cus, from 145 feet as a fresh
man to more than 167 feet last
Saturday, is matched by Ro
thert's accomplishments in im
proving his freshman mark of
around 45 feet to beyond the
52-foot line. It is quite like
ly that Stanford, represented
by only Captain Krenz and
Rothert, will place well up in
N.C.A.A. standings.

Captain Krenz yesterday received
the highest honor which can be ac
corded a Stanford track man when
he was named to receive the H. Y.
\upperle award, granted annually to
the Cardinal track or field athlete
"who has given most for his team."
"Skinny" Aupperle, to whose
memory this trophy is given
annually, entered Stanford in
1913. Slightly built, and weigh
ing btit 110 pounds, he was
nevertheless determined to do
his bit for his university on
the track. By hard work and
persistence he became an ex
cellent miler. placing a close
second to the great "Skin"
Wilson when the latter set his
Big Meet record of 4:20.2.
Aupperle was captain of the
Cardinal track squad in
1917, and one year later met
death on a battlefield of the
Balkans in the Great War.

iveness, determination, and being kind
to their mother* is undoubtedly re
sponsible for a large measure of the
Cardinal weightmcn's success, lint at
least half the credit belongs to Coach
"Dink" Templeton, master mind of
Western track mentors, whose knowl
edge of proper form and whose per
sistence in making his pupils observe
his precepts have pushed more than
one athlete from mediocrity into the
championship class.
Krenz's progress in the dis
cus, from 145 feet as a fresh
man to more than 167 feet last
Saturday, is matched by Ro
thert's accomplishments in im
proving his freshman mark of
around 45 feet to beyond the
52-foot line. It is quite like
ly that Stanford, represented
by only Captain Krenz and
Rothert, will place well up in
N.C.A.A. standings.

Captain Krenz yesterday received
the highest honor which can be ac
corded a Stanford track man when
he was named to receive the H. Y.
\upperle award, granted annually to
the Cardinal track or field athlete
"who has given most for his team."
"Skinny" Aupperle, to whose
memory this trophy is given
annually, entered Stanford in
1913. Slightly built, and weigh
ing btit 110 pounds, he was
nevertheless determined to do
his bit for his university on
the track. By hard work and
persistence he became an ex
cellent miler. placing a close
second to the great "Skin"
Wilson when the latter set his
Big Meet record of 4:20.2.
Aupperle was captain of the
Cardinal track squad in
1917, and one year later met
death on a battlefield of the
Balkans in the Great War.

downright ungrateful to ac
cept a free ride all the way
to the Atlantic coast and back
to compete in only one meet,
Stanford's mighty weight
twins, Captain Eric Krenz and
the illustrious Harlow Ro
thert, have accepted an invi
tation to represent Stanford
at the N.C.A.A. meet to be
held in Chicago June 6 and 7.
liotli Hi these by n«»\v internation

for this quarter and may without dan

lurpskin, tarry in the kast while
their teammates are speeding home
ward. Stamps of approval placed on
the project b\ both the baculty Ath
letic ( onunittce and the Board o!
Athletic Control make the venture
thoroughly official.
Applying the formula of the
law of supply and demand, it
would appear that the abilities
of Messrs. Krenz and Rothert
are of considerable value. And
that such should be the case
is no particular surprise, for
whenever either lets fly with
his favorite toy, a brand new
world's record is likely to be
written down on the books.

difficulty in meeting often
enough to keep up with Cap
