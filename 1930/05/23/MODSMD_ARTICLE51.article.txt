# A 						HOLLYWOOD TIGER ....
## Coast's Heaviest Hitter Since Tony Lazzeri, Is Fleetest Fielder to Wear Tiger Uniform Since Ty Cobb 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Elias Funk is a young man who
! should go far in major league base
ball. lie is a hard hitter, is just
twenty-live, fast and ambitious, and
it appears that, barring injuries,
he ought to follow right along in
the footsteps of such famous Tiger
i outfielders as Cobb, Veecli, Craw
word. and Heilmann. 1 don't mean
that he's a "second Ty Cobb" by
jany means. It's far too soon to pin
that tag on him. But he's the tleet
: est tiling seen in a Tiger uniform
since the renowned Georgian was
burning up tlie basepatbs of the
i American League back in the days
when base-stealing wasn't a lost
'art, and he wallops the ball at a
| lively clip, as you can tell from his
'.384 average made with Hollywood
last season.
Anyway, Detroit fans would prob
ably be raving about Funk already
if a bad leg had not kept him out
of most of the season's initial
games. He played in the opening

'game, got two liits. and handled
his fielding chances (lawlessly, and
then didn't appear in a game again
'until the twenty-second when he
was used as a pinch-hitter, lie went
in at Iris regular position, center
field, the next day, and continued
j his good work from then on.
Detroit pitchers won't, have to
worry about many vital fly balls
dropping safe in Funk's territory,
for lie is a wizard at going and
getting them, and has speed boys
on both sides of him, too, when
Johnson and Rice are playing. Al
though Funk was bought by the
Tigers on the strength of his bat
ting. Detroit fans are counting on
his speed in the outfield and on
the basepaths, and on his getting
to first by upsetting the infield with
a well-placed bunt, rather than on
his extra-base drives. But just the
same, out in Hollywood they rated
Elias the heaviest hitter turned out
by the Coast League since the day
, Tony Lazzeri left.
