# SCIENTIST STUDYING EFFECT OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE ON PLANTS
## Experiments To Determine Influence Of Fumes Being Held 
### 
"We are now conducting an experi
ment l" determine the effect oi" sulphur
dioxide on growing plants, in order tu
discover whether the fumes given off
hy smelters are harmful to the plants
growing on the farms near them,"
stated Arthur Johnson at a recent ,
meeting of Phi Lambda Lpsilo.ll,
chemistry fraternity.
*'V\ t are attempting to reproduce
the exact conditions under which
wheat plants grow and see what ef
fect the addition of sulphur dioxidi
m ann Hints nut exceeding two-tenths
oi one part in a million of air will
have nil the growth, weight, and qual- |
ity of the plant and wheat grain. The
temperature, humidity, light, and wa
ter supply are kept constant in two
large bins which are located in the
cellar <if the chemistry building. In
one bin sulphur dioxide is added to
the air, in the other nothing is added.
"< )ur research is not yet complete,
but it is clear that sulphur dioxide
does have an effect on the growth
and maturation <0 the plant. Under
certain conditions and with small
amounts of the gas it has been found
that plants are stimulated. In larger
amounts of gas the plant is 'burned.
This is similar to the' effect of strych
nine on animals. In very small
amounts strychnine acts a stimu
lant, in large quantities it is a deadly
poison. It is our object to discover
the exact effect of sulphur dioxide on
the plant under various conditions and '
determine the exact amount which
harms the plant."
