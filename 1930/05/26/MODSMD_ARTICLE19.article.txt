# LOCKOUT REVISION PLAN PASSED BY CONFERENCE; GOES TO ADMINISTRATION
## Automatic 2:30 Leaves on Week-Ends, Limited Number Of Mid-Week 11:30's, Special 2:30's Included; Women's Activities To Be Restricted 
### 
AUTOMATIC 2: :>() leaves on the week-ends, a ratio of automatic mid-j
week 11:30 leaves, for freshman and X for other classes, and special
2:30 midweek leaves, were the most outstanding changes proposed l<y i
the lockout committee and accepted by Conference Friday.
To take effect with the class of 1 it was yoted that no woman
could hold more than one of the following major offices at one time: i
member of Council, member of A.S.S.U. Executive Committee, Women's
Editor of Daily, Editor or Junior Editor of Quad. W.A..A. President,

Y.W.C.A. President, General Man-!
ager of Quad, Daily, Concert Series,
elc. (not Women's Manager).
The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
