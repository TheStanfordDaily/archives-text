# LOCKOUT REVISION PLAN PASSED BY CONFERENCE; GOES TO ADMINISTRATION
## Automatic 2:30 Leaves on Week-Ends, Limited Number Of Mid-Week 11:30's, Special 2:30's Included; Women's Activities To Be Restricted 
### 
AUTOMATIC 2: :>() leaves on the week-ends, a ratio of automatic mid-j
week 11:30 leaves, for freshman and X for other classes, and special
2:30 midweek leaves, were the most outstanding changes proposed l<y i
the lockout committee and accepted by Conference Friday.
To take effect with the class of 1 it was yoted that no woman
could hold more than one of the following major offices at one time: i
member of Council, member of A.S.S.U. Executive Committee, Women's
Editor of Daily, Editor or Junior Editor of Quad. W.A..A. President,

Y.W.C.A. President, General Man-!
ager of Quad, Daily, Concert Series,
elc. (not Women's Manager).
The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee
to safeguard health and schol
arship.
b. A great, part of the "waste"
(common to both the men and
the women students) occurs
during the day and after the
present lockout hours, and its
desired prevention cannot be
achieved through rules.
2. That, any tendency toward im
morality increases with the late
ness of the hour.
a. The present 1:30 and over
night privileges have had lit
tle effect either way on im
moral conduct.
3. That a grant of freedom to the
the women would bring severe
censure upon the name of the
University.
a. An educational institution
which teaches independence
of intellectual attitude should
not be disturbed by public
opinion.
4. That parents of the women stu
dents would voice strenuous ob
jections, perhaps to the extent
of removing their daughters from
the University.
a. It is possible that there are
sufficient numbers of women
applicants whose parents ap
prove of upper division free
dom for the 5(10 quota to re
main filled.
fi That difficulties of administra
tion, i.e., protecting the resi
dences from marauders who
might enter an open house or
dormitory late at night, prevent
further consideration of the pro
posal.
a. Adequate precautions might
be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch
man system, as at. other uni
versities, for Roble.
b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition
al night watchman should not
deter a move which is so sig
nificant for the position of wo
men students as individuals
on this campus.
"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic
with our stand to the fact that an
actual educational campaign to con
vince the 'skeptics' of our essential
maturity in this regard, is neces
sary before any favorable action
may be expected. The administra
tion, the general public, the par
ents, and certain of the women
themselves, should be brought to
the realization that upper division
women are capable of group and
individual responsibility.
"We suggest that the point, of
view herein expressed be vigorous
ly supported by every upper divi
sion woman who does not believe
that they have adolescent judg
ment."
The majority of the committee,
however, in consideration of exist
ing conditions, presents the follow
ing plan for reasonable regulations
for all the women:
I. Late leaves as follows:
A. Week-ends: 2:3 ft.
B. Midweek:
1. Automatic 11:30 in the fol
lowing ratio:

ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee
to safeguard health and schol
arship.
b. A great, part of the "waste"
(common to both the men and
the women students) occurs
during the day and after the
present lockout hours, and its
desired prevention cannot be
achieved through rules.
2. That, any tendency toward im
morality increases with the late
ness of the hour.
a. The present 1:30 and over
night privileges have had lit
tle effect either way on im
moral conduct.
3. That a grant of freedom to the
the women would bring severe
censure upon the name of the
University.
a. An educational institution
which teaches independence
of intellectual attitude should
not be disturbed by public
opinion.
4. That parents of the women stu
dents would voice strenuous ob
jections, perhaps to the extent
of removing their daughters from
the University.
a. It is possible that there are
sufficient numbers of women
applicants whose parents ap
prove of upper division free
dom for the 5(10 quota to re
main filled.
fi That difficulties of administra
tion, i.e., protecting the resi
dences from marauders who
might enter an open house or
dormitory late at night, prevent
further consideration of the pro
posal.
a. Adequate precautions might
be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch
man system, as at. other uni
versities, for Roble.
b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition
al night watchman should not
deter a move which is so sig
nificant for the position of wo
men students as individuals
on this campus.
"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic
with our stand to the fact that an
actual educational campaign to con
vince the 'skeptics' of our essential
maturity in this regard, is neces
sary before any favorable action
may be expected. The administra
tion, the general public, the par
ents, and certain of the women
themselves, should be brought to
the realization that upper division
women are capable of group and
individual responsibility.
"We suggest that the point, of
view herein expressed be vigorous
ly supported by every upper divi
sion woman who does not believe
that they have adolescent judg
ment."
The majority of the committee,
however, in consideration of exist
ing conditions, presents the follow
ing plan for reasonable regulations
for all the women:
I. Late leaves as follows:
A. Week-ends: 2:3 ft.
B. Midweek:
1. Automatic 11:30 in the fol
lowing ratio:
a. Three per quarter for
freshmen, first-quarter
women, women having
made less than a* "C"

b. None for women on

r. Eight per quarter for all

2. 2:.'! ft during week:
a. Row: on permission of i
house or A.W.S. presi

b. Roble:
1. Preferred plan: leave
granted as above by

be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con

of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an

posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee
to safeguard health and schol
arship.
b. A great, part of the "waste"
(common to both the men and
the women students) occurs
during the day and after the
present lockout hours, and its
desired prevention cannot be
achieved through rules.
2. That, any tendency toward im
morality increases with the late
ness of the hour.
a. The present 1:30 and over
night privileges have had lit
tle effect either way on im
moral conduct.
3. That a grant of freedom to the
the women would bring severe
censure upon the name of the
University.
a. An educational institution
which teaches independence
of intellectual attitude should
not be disturbed by public
opinion.
4. That parents of the women stu
dents would voice strenuous ob
jections, perhaps to the extent
of removing their daughters from
the University.
a. It is possible that there are
sufficient numbers of women
applicants whose parents ap
prove of upper division free
dom for the 5(10 quota to re
main filled.
fi That difficulties of administra
tion, i.e., protecting the resi
dences from marauders who
might enter an open house or
dormitory late at night, prevent
further consideration of the pro
posal.
a. Adequate precautions might
be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch
man system, as at. other uni
versities, for Roble.
b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition
al night watchman should not
deter a move which is so sig
nificant for the position of wo
men students as individuals
on this campus.
"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic
with our stand to the fact that an
actual educational campaign to con
vince the 'skeptics' of our essential
maturity in this regard, is neces
sary before any favorable action
may be expected. The administra
tion, the general public, the par
ents, and certain of the women
themselves, should be brought to
the realization that upper division
women are capable of group and
individual responsibility.
"We suggest that the point, of
view herein expressed be vigorous
ly supported by every upper divi
sion woman who does not believe
that they have adolescent judg
ment."
The majority of the committee,
however, in consideration of exist
ing conditions, presents the follow
ing plan for reasonable regulations
for all the women:
I. Late leaves as follows:
A. Week-ends: 2:3 ft.
B. Midweek:

The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in

sufficient numbers of women

might enter an open house or

be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch

b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition

deter a move which is so sig

"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic
with our stand to the fact that an
actual educational campaign to con
vince the 'skeptics' of our essential
maturity in this regard, is neces
sary before any favorable action
may be expected. The administra

themselves, should be brought to
the realization that upper division
women are capable of group and
individual responsibility.

The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee

The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee
to safeguard health and schol
arship.
b. A great, part of the "waste"
(common to both the men and
the women students) occurs
during the day and after the
present lockout hours, and its
desired prevention cannot be
achieved through rules.
2. That, any tendency toward im
morality increases with the late
ness of the hour.
a. The present 1:30 and over
night privileges have had lit
tle effect either way on im
moral conduct.
3. That a grant of freedom to the
the women would bring severe
censure upon the name of the
University.
a. An educational institution
which teaches independence
of intellectual attitude should
not be disturbed by public
opinion.
4. That parents of the women stu
dents would voice strenuous ob
jections, perhaps to the extent
of removing their daughters from
the University.
a. It is possible that there are
sufficient numbers of women
applicants whose parents ap
prove of upper division free
dom for the 5(10 quota to re
main filled.
fi That difficulties of administra
tion, i.e., protecting the resi
dences from marauders who
might enter an open house or
dormitory late at night, prevent
further consideration of the pro
posal.
a. Adequate precautions might
be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch
man system, as at. other uni
versities, for Roble.
b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition
al night watchman should not
deter a move which is so sig
nificant for the position of wo
men students as individuals
on this campus.
"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic

The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee
to safeguard health and schol
arship.
b. A great, part of the "waste"
(common to both the men and
the women students) occurs
during the day and after the
present lockout hours, and its
desired prevention cannot be
achieved through rules.
2. That, any tendency toward im
morality increases with the late
ness of the hour.
a. The present 1:30 and over
night privileges have had lit
tle effect either way on im
moral conduct.
3. That a grant of freedom to the
the women would bring severe
censure upon the name of the
University.
a. An educational institution
which teaches independence
of intellectual attitude should
not be disturbed by public
opinion.
4. That parents of the women stu
dents would voice strenuous ob
jections, perhaps to the extent
of removing their daughters from
the University.
a. It is possible that there are
sufficient numbers of women
applicants whose parents ap
prove of upper division free
dom for the 5(10 quota to re
main filled.
fi That difficulties of administra
tion, i.e., protecting the resi
dences from marauders who
might enter an open house or
dormitory late at night, prevent
further consideration of the pro
posal.
a. Adequate precautions might
be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch
man system, as at. other uni
versities, for Roble.
b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition
al night watchman should not
deter a move which is so sig
nificant for the position of wo
men students as individuals
on this campus.
"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic
with our stand to the fact that an
actual educational campaign to con
vince the 'skeptics' of our essential
maturity in this regard, is neces
sary before any favorable action
may be expected. The administra
tion, the general public, the par
ents, and certain of the women
themselves, should be brought to
the realization that upper division
women are capable of group and
individual responsibility.
"We suggest that the point, of
view herein expressed be vigorous
ly supported by every upper divi
sion woman who does not believe
that they have adolescent judg
ment."
The majority of the committee,
however, in consideration of exist
ing conditions, presents the follow
ing plan for reasonable regulations
for all the women:
I. Late leaves as follows:
A. Week-ends: 2:3 ft.
B. Midweek:
1. Automatic 11:30 in the fol
lowing ratio:
a. Three per quarter for
freshmen, first-quarter
women, women having
made less than a* "C"
average quarter before.
b. None for women on
"pro."
r. Eight per quarter for all
o t liens.
2. 2:.'! ft during week:
a. Row: on permission of i
house or A.W.S. presi

arship to be considered
before grant; keys to be
given out by lockout
chairman and returned
to her next morning. :
b. Roble:
1. Preferred plan: leave
granted as above by

AUTOMATIC 2: :>() leaves on the week-ends, a ratio of automatic mid-j
week 11:30 leaves, for freshman and X for other classes, and special
2:30 midweek leaves, were the most outstanding changes proposed l<y i
the lockout committee and accepted by Conference Friday.
To take effect with the class of 1 it was yoted that no woman
could hold more than one of the following major offices at one time: i
member of Council, member of A.S.S.U. Executive Committee, Women's
Editor of Daily, Editor or Junior Editor of Quad. W.A..A. President,

Y.W.C.A. President, General Man-!
ager of Quad, Daily, Concert Series,
elc. (not Women's Manager).
The present highway rule which j
specifies that "except, as a means |
of conveyance between their homes ■
{Mid the campus, or Palo Alto and
I lie campus, first-quarter freshman \
women may not motor off-campus j
alter dark unless accompanied by j
another Stanford woman," was l
abolished by a unanimous vote.
Following is the complete report j
passed by Conference Friday, and
submitted to Dean Mary Yost and !
Acting President Robert 10. Swain
for final action:
Committee Report •
General Dissatisfaction with the!
present lockout rules seems to in-j
dicate that there is a need for I
change. ;
We have found that there are |
two main causes for this dissatis-:
faction. (1) No late leave privi- j
leges during the week l'or those !
who go to San Francisco for danc
ing on nights when the floor is less
crowded; (2) 1:30 limit on week-j
ends for the many who go to the j
City and speed down the highway
instead of making an inconvenient
ly early return to the campus.
It is evident, the Committee i
feels, that these two rules do not |
lit the present situation, for in
stead of returning to the campus at i
the lockout hour many of the wo- j
men prefer to stay all night in j
Palo Alto and vicinity. Among the
objections to this practice are j
| these: (ll possible inconvenience'
to the hostess, (2) waste of time
I next morning returning to the liv-j
I ing group, (3) unfair time exten
sion advantage for those who have I
| entre to homes in the vicinity, ;
(4) establishment of undesirable
| attitude of avoidance.
First Attempted Plan
Acting on the premise that jun-j
iors and seniors are sufficiently
mature to govern themselves with- j
out the aid of rules, the commit
tee's first attempted solution was a
plan for no regulations for the
upper division, with sufficient rules
| during the first two years so that
i a knowledge of campus standards
!of conduct might he established
, with each individual, and with ad
ditional precautionary machinery
j (health and scholarship checks
i through particular committees
working with the house presidents)
jso thai abuses of the proposed
i freedom might be prevented as far
• as possible and so that no accelera
nt ion of the present waste of lime
I and energy would result.
i After consulting with Dean Yost,
, however, the committee agreed that
the present living conditions where
both upper and lower classes are
jin the same building, would not
permit the adoption of this plan,
since it is difficult to create a feel
ing of group responsibility suffi
ciently strong to guide through in
dividual pressure the conduct of a
possible irresponsible minority,
however desirable the system might
be from the point of view of indi
vidual freedom and the educational
value of choice.
Specifically, it was considered in
expedient to place too much re
sponsibility for checking the con
duct of the less mature members
of the group upon women students
who, in the first place, might !><•
unwilling to assume such responsi
bility and, secondly, whose own
time should be devoted to those
activities for which they came to
the University. Until therefore, an
I arrangement similar to the pro
posed llarkness plan of tutors in
tlie dormitories at Yale and Har
vard or the system at Barnard
where young women members of
the faculty or other counselors live
within the group might be possible,
the majority of the. committee felt
that it would be both unwise and
impracticable to have no regula
tions, even for upperelassmen,
At this point, however, certain
members of the committee wish to
insert a dissenting opinion.
"We feel that a significant num
ber of women students believes
that a declaration of faith in the
sufficient good sense of upper divi
sion women properly to organize
their own time has been called for;
, that the size of the upper division
minority who allegedly needs the
protection of rules has been seri
ously overestimated, both by the
administration and the committee;
and that any abuses of the proposed
freedom which might ensue would
be so few as to he readily handled
by (lie women's student, govern
ment officers without overwork or
inefficiency.
"We wish to take this opportun
ity to point out certain weaknesses
in the objections which have been
voiced to the proposed grant of no
lockout rules for upper division
i women.
Object ions:
1 1, That ;m increase in freedom
would accelerate waste during
the present phase of adolescent
development.
a. Machinery has already been
worked out by the committee
to safeguard health and schol
arship.
b. A great, part of the "waste"
(common to both the men and
the women students) occurs
during the day and after the
present lockout hours, and its
desired prevention cannot be
achieved through rules.
2. That, any tendency toward im
morality increases with the late
ness of the hour.
a. The present 1:30 and over
night privileges have had lit
tle effect either way on im
moral conduct.
3. That a grant of freedom to the
the women would bring severe
censure upon the name of the
University.
a. An educational institution
which teaches independence
of intellectual attitude should
not be disturbed by public
opinion.
4. That parents of the women stu
dents would voice strenuous ob
jections, perhaps to the extent
of removing their daughters from
the University.
a. It is possible that there are
sufficient numbers of women
applicants whose parents ap
prove of upper division free
dom for the 5(10 quota to re
main filled.
fi That difficulties of administra
tion, i.e., protecting the resi
dences from marauders who
might enter an open house or
dormitory late at night, prevent
further consideration of the pro
posal.
a. Adequate precautions might
be arranged: individual keys
for the Row; a. night watch
man system, as at. other uni
versities, for Roble.
b. Economic considerations in
regard to paying an addition
al night watchman should not
deter a move which is so sig
nificant for the position of wo
men students as individuals
on this campus.
"At present the situation is at a
deadlock of conflicting opinions:
one side has faith in the ability of
Stanford upper division women to
act with mature judgment, and the
other believes that the number
who would need help in adjustment
is so large that student administra
tion could not be adequate. Neither
side, of course, can produce statis
tics in support of its stand; agree
ment one way or the other will
have to be by other means.
"We wish to call the attention of
those women who are sympathetic
with our stand to the fact that an
actual educational campaign to con
vince the 'skeptics' of our essential
maturity in this regard, is neces
sary before any favorable action
may be expected. The administra
tion, the general public, the par
ents, and certain of the women
themselves, should be brought to
the realization that upper division
women are capable of group and
individual responsibility.
"We suggest that the point, of
view herein expressed be vigorous
ly supported by every upper divi
sion woman who does not believe
that they have adolescent judg
ment."
The majority of the committee,
however, in consideration of exist
ing conditions, presents the follow
ing plan for reasonable regulations
for all the women:
I. Late leaves as follows:
A. Week-ends: 2:3 ft.
B. Midweek:
1. Automatic 11:30 in the fol
lowing ratio:
a. Three per quarter for
freshmen, first-quarter
women, women having
made less than a* "C"
average quarter before.
b. None for women on
"pro."
r. Eight per quarter for all
o t liens.
2. 2:.'! ft during week:
a. Row: on permission of i
house or A.W.S. presi
dent; health and schol
arship to be considered
before grant; keys to be
given out by lockout
chairman and returned
to her next morning. :
b. Roble:
1. Preferred plan: leave
granted as above by
house or A.W.S. presi
dent: night matron on
duty until 2:30 if re
quired, to be paid by
additional Roble Club
dues. (Graduate stu
dent suggested if regu
lar night matron's
hours already taken.) 1

I 2. Compromise p la n :
leave granted by house
or A.W.S. president,
but if funds not avail
able to pay for night
matron and since keys,
inexpedient for so
large a group, author
ized overnight privi
lege to stay in Palo

for by house director
from list of hostesses
provided by Dean of
Women.

less than average

for women on "pro."
