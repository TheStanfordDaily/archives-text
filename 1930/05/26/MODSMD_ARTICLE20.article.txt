# SEQUOIA'S STORE IS RETURNED TO OWNER AT LAST
## 
### 
Sequoia's wandering cigar
store, straying, goodness knows
where, has returned to its origi
nal location and owner, accord
ing to the best advices available.
Bob Sawyer, owner of the en
terprise, reported the store "lost,
strayed, or stolen" last week.
Not even a wrapper was left to
marlv the spot, let alone "X's."
If is rumored that the store
traveled to the fourth floor of
the Hall. Later, noise attracted
Sawyer to the second floor,
where, it is alleged, smokes were
being retailed at cut-rate prices.
