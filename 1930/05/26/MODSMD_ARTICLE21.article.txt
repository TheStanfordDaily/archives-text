## Record Seeker Leaps Out At 25,000 Feet 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 25.(/ Pi -
Bert White, 27, seeking a new rec- j
ord for parachute jumps, bailed out
of a plane flown by Earl Gordon ;
today at an altitude m 25,000 feet
and had not been sighted two hours !
and a half later.
Gordon, when he returned to the I
airport, said he reached the alti
tude over the Antelope Valley after j
some difficulty, and that White '
jumped between Lancaster and j
Palmdale. The pilot said he dived |
and circled for 20 minutes but was j
unable to locale White in the air.:
Attendants in automobiles with !
field glasses, stationed at the two!
cities in the valley, had not re
ported sighting him. White ex
pected to reach the earth in less
than two hours.
Inspection of Gordon's plane in- \
dictated that the automatic trip had j
opened White's parachute.
White sought to break the leap ■
record by Captain W. A. Stevens :
at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, in \
1!»22, of 24,402 feet. He carried a -
barograph and supplies for three j
days, to record his jump and to !
keep him alive if he should be \
blown into isolated mountains.
