# MISSING JUDGE POUND DEAD AT BASE OF CLIFF
## Indications Point To Death From Accidental Cause; Suicide Theory Scouted $1,000 Reward Spurs Two Jobless Men To Search In Unused Rock Quarry 
### 
OAKLAND, May 25. (/P) The
body of Superior Judge Edward YV.
Fugs, for whom a state-wide search
had been conducted since he di
appeared from his home here May
10 last, was found today, broken
by a plunge from a 150-foot cliff.
The search thai for ten days sent
thousands of men swarming
through the East Bay hills; th.it
spread through Northern Califor
nia and into distant states; that
employed airplanes, bloodhounds,
and expert "trackers" thus ended
abruptly.
The tragic answer to the mys
tery that stirred a vast region 112
vealed itself within two blocks of
Oakland's Broadway, within three
blocks, of the home at 5301 Broad
way terrace from which the jurist
vanished on the morning of May
IG.
Earn Reward
Two jobless men, Paul lionham
and Jack Maher. spurred by the
$1,000 reward offered for finding
the missing judge "dead or alive,"
came upon the body in a quarry
operated by the Oakland Paving
Company.
Hidden by scrub vegetation, it
sprawled at the base of a sheet
precipice in a location visited by
numerous searchers and frequented
daily by quarry laborers.
There was broken sod that told
of a misstep on the edge of tiie
cliff. There was a shrub growth, it
single stem bent and stripped of
leaves, that told of a frantic hand
reaching for something to avert
that 150-foot dropâ€”reaching and
just missing.
An examination of the body
showed that death had resulted
from a crushed chest. It. revealed
many broken bones, but no evi
dence of wounds or injuries that
might have come from causes other
than the fall.
Satisfied that the death was
purely accidental, convinced that
neither murder nor suicide is ten
able, Commissioner Frank Colbourn
and Police Chief James T. Drew of
Oakland announced that, police ac
tivity in the case is ended.
