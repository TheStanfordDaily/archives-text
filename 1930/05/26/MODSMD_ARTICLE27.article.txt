# THE 						WOMEN'S DREAM CASTLE
## 
### 
Months of planning and labor have come to nothing, it seems.
Alter years of agitation on the part of Stanford women to make
some provision for a building to supplant the archaic structure
which served as a girls' gymnasium, the Board of Athletic Control
finally ended the trouble by voting the sum of $225,000 for the erec
tion of a new building.
Immediately there was great rejoicing among the Five Hundred
and among their male supporters who appreciated the women's gen-;
nine need in this respect.
With success in sight, a committee—chosen to formulate the j
firls needs—went to work. After months of planning and labor,
plans were drawn up and bids were submitted.
Imagine the amazement of everyone—particularly the Board —!
when ii was found that the committee, instead of working within I
ibe limits of its $225,000, had made plans which called for $25,000
1 o $40,000 extra !
Naturally, the Board of \thletic Control balked at the idea of
putting up such a sum in addition to the amount already granted.
I nless the plans are altered so as to call for less money or the Board
finds some way-of securing the extra cash, the women's gym—rosy
dream of .30 years—is as tar from reality as it ever was.
The fault lies with the committee. Knowing that $225,000 would |
Ik available, plans should have been drawing up which necessitated |
the expenditure of $225,000 and no more. Money will go onlv sci I
far. It cannot be stretched beyond a certain point.
But it is to be desired that this lack of foresight will not mean '■
the end of three decades of hope. In spite of miscalculations on the '
part of their committee, the women deserve a new gymnasium as j
much as they ever did.
Ibe Board's attitude is easily appreciated, and Board members
rat mot be blamed for their stand. But in view of the worthiness of i
the cause let us hope that some means can be found whereby the :
extra funds can be secured. Couldn't some item on the $1,000,000 j
B.A.C. building program be postponed:
