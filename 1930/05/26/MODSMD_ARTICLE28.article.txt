# THE 						UNIVERSITY DECIDES THE QUESTION
## 
### 
I he l ive Hundred came to the point Iridav and made an im
portant step toward the progress of Stanford womanhood when the
\ omen's lockout committee definitely adopted a new set of regu
lations. These may be found in other columns of today's Daily.
It is now for the Administration to determine whether or not
the women shall control their own destiny. Dean Mary Yost and
\cting President Robert K. Swain have before them the committee's
report urging that more lenient lockout hours be granted.
I pon the Administration lies the responsibility of action—
v hether it be for or against, with an immediate or tardy decision.
If the Administration sanctions the committee's report, the work
1o remove the present nefarious double standard among the students
lias been well accomplished. 11 will be an advancement in educa
tional methods for the I'niversitv as well as a boon to the feminine
population.
If the Administration vetoes the report, the present agitation
lias brought home to the co-eds the knowledge that lockout regu
lations have no moral and no health significance. It has also caused
the l ive Hundred to realize that they should have a voice in the
• '(■termination of rules governing them. And that is good!
