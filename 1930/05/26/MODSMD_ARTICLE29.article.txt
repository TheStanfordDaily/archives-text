# THE 						JAPANESE QUESTION
## 
### 
Representative Johnson ( Rep.). (, i Washington has broken a
six-year silence <>n the immigration law excluding Japanese from
the United States.
Said Washington's Johnson: "In due time, after certain immi
gration legislation has been disposed of, I expect to move for an
amendment to the 1')24 act that will give Japan its proportionate
quota." •
In this belated stand, the western representative has shown rare
wisdom. One wonders why il took him six long years to discover
the obvious desirability of such a move.
\ll undeserved and unnecessary insult to a great people, the
Japanese exclusion act has long stood as epochal in its stupidity.
If the proposed amendment is put through and the Japanese
.- re placed on the schedule with other races, the number admitted
will increase hardly at all. Hut objectionable discrimination against
.1 great and friendly power will be ended.
The Japanese still resent this six-year-old act —and they have a
right to feel as they do. 11 is to be ardently hoped that Johnson and
his colleagues will quickly remove the cause for resentment.
The scar on a sensitive pride cannot be removed at once, but the
proposed amendment will end continual irritation of the wound.
