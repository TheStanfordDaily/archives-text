# Campus Opinion
## DOWN WITH PETTINESS 
### 
, The Editor, Sir :
Having been so cordially invited by i
j yonr editorial column to say some- |
thing about the "500" status here, I |
! will: namely this :
l-or about a week, this tirade on
I the men's part has been going on, j
I building up situations, in both men's j
and women's minds here, which do i
not exist. It's like the fellow who i
stands on a street corner and looks '
up—but before long the whole busy
: throng is looking up too —to see what ? '
Well, they don't know, but the fellow j
on the corner did it, so something j
must be up there.
j One Stanford co-ed, calling herself j
"experienced-in-lovc" ( ?), wrote a I
, rather undiplomatic and certain un- I
! representative campus opinion regard- |
ing the consensus of women's opinions t
j about men. And then the bonfire i
j started. I don't blame the men for |
j rising to the occasion as they did— '
but this is all, as regards this point,
I that I wish to say—what makes you
men think that all Stanford women
! hacked this feminine radical? The past
campus opinions have done nothing

| hut create an unnecessary and stupid
j "No-Man's-I.and" between the two
sexes here.
If some of the men here want to
'take ('aland .VI ills girls out—sure—
; go ahead ; if some one lone-star woman
writes a nasty opinion about the men
| —try and find out whether all the
j women are so inclined—and then write
1 in your "R.S.V.IVs."
And this is my next point. The
' column, Campus Opinion, is one of the
Daily's best instruments to reflect the
general attitude of the campus. Then
' why abuse it with vicious, high-school
i ish "tit-for-tats" ? We laughed, didn't
I we, when Cal published it's "Song
jof Hate"—'it sounded so sour-grapesy,
i hut can't you imagine just what a
1 high-school bunch of babies we must
| read like when we run days of vicious
I"I hate you women —" and "You men
t arc 'lousy' " letters ?
J What do you say, men (and women
' too), that we be good sports—that we
bury this gory Stanford hatchet—call
it quits—and try filling Campus Opin
ion with stuff that's genuinely inter
esting to all, and not so petty?
—One o' them thar co-eds
