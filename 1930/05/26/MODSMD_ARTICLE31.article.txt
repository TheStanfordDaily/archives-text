# AN ANCIENT PEGGY

The Editor, Sir:
The late controversy indulged in by
the Stan females as to how the men
should behave has been amusing. It
appears Stanford men should dress
better, buy more flowers for the ladies,
consider themselves very lucky that
the 500 arc available for circulation,
and realize that it is a cardinal crime
i to drag in feminities from other ports.
To say that a Stanford man should
! not take out anyone except a Stan
female is to say that a person who
works in a candy factory should not
smoke Lucky Strikes. The popularity
1 of, say, California co-eds over the na
tives may be traced to the fact that
the 1»1 ne and Gold ladies are more
like women that the Farm products.
A California co-ed's kiss is ex
changed; a 500 ditto is given with a
j gigantic flourish of condescension . . .
the dear girls not understanding that
j the award is as empty as a member
ship in the Legion of Honor.
As soon as the Stan females will
deign to realize that taking a girl to
; a show or tea dancing is the greatest
nuisance ever invented ... at that time
j will the relation of the sexes on the
; barm become more cordial.
From the avalanche of pro-con ar
j guments two incorrect assumptions
I peek forth: (1) that the Stanford
| men are a tribe of rascals; (2) that
: the Stan females have as much appeal

! ;is Peggy Joyce fifty years hence. For
! the men I will say that if they are
! all rascals it is a rather comforting
4 fact: all the greatest figures in his
! Tory have ho en super-rascals. For the
i women I propose that there are a
! great many who are chic and delight
j ful up to midnight; some of them
! even show a tendency to make respec
! tahle night club hostesses and movie
' stars. When the war is over, it will
j be sadly remembered that, after all,
I Stanford is a college . . . not a Green
! wich Village artistium.
j If the Stan females cannot keep
; away from ennui with live times as
many men around it is time for mes
i demoiselles to invest their pennies in a
j mirror and a few massages; if the
' Cardinal men find the S(H) annoying
they may be consoled that there are
i only five hundred.
i Here are a few exclusive shots:
1. Stanfemales are not intelligent;
but they are full of knowledge.
2. The Stanford men do not dislike
j the 500; they arc afraid of them.
.1. Stanfemales are not ritzy; they
j are scared to betray their softer feel
' i»gs.
4. Stanfemales are the same as. oth
er women; only it takes them three
I years longer to reach the same per
; spective of life.
Cordially,
I —-Martin Frankel
