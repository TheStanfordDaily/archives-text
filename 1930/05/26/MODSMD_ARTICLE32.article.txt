# AN "ALLEGED" STATEMENT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"Alleged statement" is the correct
term to apply to the Associated Press
dispatches of certain remarks of mine
in a talk which I recently gave to a
club in San Jose. The talk was of
the general geological and physical
features of Santa Clara Valley.
Jn that talk I spoke briefly of the
evidences of volcanic activity in the
past, throughout the valley; hut I
did nnt state that Morgan Mill is on a
live volcano.

As far as I know my opinions upon
the various features, volcanic and
j others, agree in the main with those
of the other geologists who have stud
ied the region.
I realized that T had been mistuider
j stood and my statements misconstrued
in certain news items, but they were
! given more nearly correctly in a later
1 paper.
Yours truly,
—Fred Buss
