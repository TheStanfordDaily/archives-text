A YEARBOOK OF STANFORD
WRITING. Published by the
English Club, Stanford Univer
sity.
Some astonishingly finp pieeps of
writing, especially in the short
story department, are included in
(his collection. Most outstanding is
"Mirion's Death" by Achilles Holt,
in which a commonplace theme and
characters are handled with re
markable maturity of technique.
The intimacy of Holt's word pic
tures about tile dying old lady, and
about, details of the old lady's
household are quite brilliant. The
dialogue is neat, restrained and na
tural, and so well executed that
without apparently aiming for hu
mor or pathos, the author achieves
both in a very interesting degree.
A veritable artist with words,
Holt has written a number of strik
ing passages, although sometimes
be overshoots his mark.
"Elva opened her mouth widely.
Her strong, thick words jumped
smoothly from her throat out of
her lips. Sometimes she chewed
words, lingering on the broad
vowels." Here is exaggeration. Holt
does better work when he is con
tent with simpler descriptions.
Katharine Rich's "Summer's
Day" is a delicate story, not as
strong as "Mirion's Death," and
with dialogue less skillful; it has a
number of descriptive passages —
lovely, fanciful things—that are
quite linp. "Mary Ellen Goes Home"
by Lfeßoy Rumsey has a trite
theme, with stretches of excellent
writing pieced togpther with dis
tinctly trite phrases: "Far away
rose the hills, strong and indomit
able, unbeaten by the elements,
scornful of the buffets of Time." A
little stricter blue-pencilling, elimin
ating such expressions as a ".sick
ening sense of shame," and the ex
pression quoted, and several of a
similar wornness would improve
Rumsey's work.
John Elting's "Loup Garou" is a
grim story, made extremely effec
tive by a vividly original vocabu
lary. To achieve his effect of hor
ror, the author blurs his story, and
H remains unrei? throughout. Yet

(.his unreality grips one very !
| strongly at times—in spite of the'
fact tliat the including of a gentle- j
man-eyed heroine weakens the gen- j
eral effect.
S. L. Bradshaw has contributed !
several intimate sketches, inconse
quential, but deft and amusing, j
"Feather's" by Jean Magnus is a !
story of the "Western Adventure
Type," elevated by the author's ex- I
cellent style.
The poetry is hard to criticize. |
Maxine rustling's "Return" is the i
best. The construction of this poem j
is peculiarly skillful, so that in ihe
first verse, one is emotionally up- !
lifted, and in the short second
verse this sensation is reversed, I
and the curiously unemphatic me- |
tie, plus the colorless words used,;
give a fiat finality to the idea of i
the poem which-is artistically very i
fine. For the rest of the poems, !
outstanding were "The Ballad of
Eldorado," by Ruth Ashen, "Noc
turne," by Harry Earl Jones, parts
of "Shadows," by Cary Odell. Pol- j
lard's "Song of the Spheres" shows
unusual depth of thought, coupled
with unusual metric abiltv.

RETURN OF DOCTOR FU MAN
CHU —At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Here is the "Mysterious Doctor
Fu Manchu" done over again.
Successful mystery story writers
find no difficulty in using their pre
cocious brain children to double
advantage. Not only can Sherlock I
Holmes and Doctor Fu Manchu
live for the literary exploitation by '
their creators, but they can also
die.
There is every likelihood, despite
a promise to the contrary, that Fu
is not yet dead. And the object of
bis father, Dr. Pietre, lives on as
another occasion for the resurrec
tion of Rohmer's mad man.
It is pictures such as this that
give unoriented Easterners a con- |
sumlng dread of Orientals. But by '
a dictum of Will Hayes, Russians ;
and Chinese are now available for j
portrayal of villains.

RETURN OF DOCTOR FU MAN
CHU —At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Here is the "Mysterious Doctor
Fu Manchu" done over again.
Successful mystery story writers
find no difficulty in using their pre
cocious brain children to double
advantage. Not only can Sherlock I
Holmes and Doctor Fu Manchu
live for the literary exploitation by '
their creators, but they can also
die.
There is every likelihood, despite
a promise to the contrary, that Fu
is not yet dead. And the object of
bis father, Dr. Pietre, lives on as
another occasion for the resurrec
tion of Rohmer's mad man.
It is pictures such as this that
give unoriented Easterners a con- |
sumlng dread of Orientals. But by '

A YEARBOOK OF STANFORD
WRITING. Published by the
English Club, Stanford Univer
sity.
Some astonishingly finp pieeps of
writing, especially in the short
story department, are included in
(his collection. Most outstanding is
"Mirion's Death" by Achilles Holt,
in which a commonplace theme and
characters are handled with re
markable maturity of technique.
The intimacy of Holt's word pic
tures about tile dying old lady, and
about, details of the old lady's
household are quite brilliant. The
dialogue is neat, restrained and na
tural, and so well executed that
without apparently aiming for hu
mor or pathos, the author achieves
both in a very interesting degree.
A veritable artist with words,
Holt has written a number of strik
ing passages, although sometimes
be overshoots his mark.
"Elva opened her mouth widely.
Her strong, thick words jumped
smoothly from her throat out of
her lips. Sometimes she chewed
words, lingering on the broad
vowels." Here is exaggeration. Holt
does better work when he is con
tent with simpler descriptions.
Katharine Rich's "Summer's
Day" is a delicate story, not as
strong as "Mirion's Death," and
with dialogue less skillful; it has a
number of descriptive passages —
lovely, fanciful things—that are
quite linp. "Mary Ellen Goes Home"
by Lfeßoy Rumsey has a trite
theme, with stretches of excellent
writing pieced togpther with dis
tinctly trite phrases: "Far away
rose the hills, strong and indomit
able, unbeaten by the elements,
scornful of the buffets of Time." A
little stricter blue-pencilling, elimin
ating such expressions as a ".sick
ening sense of shame," and the ex
pression quoted, and several of a
similar wornness would improve
Rumsey's work.
