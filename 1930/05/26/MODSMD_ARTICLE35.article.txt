So far in this football prospects
si lies, all of Stanford's opponents
have been picked to pieces—or just
plain picked. And in the pre-season
iesum6, "Pop" Warner's stalwarts
have heen Riven the edge in every
Conference contest. Now we rise
lo discuss California.
"What, no spinach!" as Tad
Dorgan used to say. Just so,
the Bears loom up, at present,
as just another gravy team for
the Cards to face. In fact
Berkeley looks to have the
poorest team of the Coast Big
Four and the weakest team
since 1926 when Stanford de
feated U.C., 41-6.
Like practically every other
leant in the country, California has
a perfectly Rood lirst string back
liehl. Mut unfortunately a forward
line is the bin' factor in any grid
battle, and any team that hasn't a
fast, heavy, and experienced line
never gets very far not in West
i 'oast foot ball anyway.
Nine prominent members of
the Price machine will be lost
through graduation. The Lom-
Barr-Eisan trio has finally
played out its three years in
the backfield and fleet-footed
Lee Rice is no more. Then
Schwarz and Pitto, the best
guard duo on the coast last
year, have played their last for
dear old Cal. Gill, another
guard, is gone.
To tote I lie porcine-covered oval
in the fall, his Nibs has Joe Hick
ingbotltam and the brothers G:
Griffiths, (iarritv, and Gill. The
boys total 75!) pounds in all and
California should do great stuff in
the backfield until one of 'em gets
injured. Kirwan is a fair substitute
for Ed Griffiths at quarter and Mc-
Cutcheon may see action. Castro is
about the only man to relieve Rusty
Gill at full, but there's Coffiekl, a
good passer. Smith, Hinder, Potter,
and Fritichie that are halves and
may be shifted to help out Hick
ingbothani and Moose Garritv. Hut
the main trouble with the outlay,
including the first string too, is ex
perience.
Too little knowledge about
the grand old pastime is the
chief fault with the line, also.
Captain Carl Handy, almost an
unknown, and Ted Beckett,
regular tackle last year, will
attempt to fill Schwartz's and
Pitto's shoes at guard, but will
probably have quite a hard
time doing it. Butch Medanich,
who played well against W.S.C.
last year, will return as a let
tcrman and hold down the
pivot position.
Dolph Timmerman will he back
in bis old berth at tackle, but he
and bis running mate, Beckett, will
be remembered as the ones who
allowed the Stanford backs to run
amuck on off-tackle plays last year.
Nick Hican. also a letterman, will
probably play the other tackle. Hob
Hart let* is sure to be back on the
flanks, and Russ Avery and Togo
Thornton are eligible, but may not
return.
All in all, it looks like a big day
for Sequoia's "twenty-one" next
November 22, and a sad one for
the campus of the white spike. Who
i lse llie Calit'ornians will meet in
the aulmnn is uncertain, but Gradu
ate Manager Bill Monahan is going
East this summer to dicker for a
game with Navy. Of course, West
ern teams must be upheld, but if
the Pricemen play the .Middies, it
appears that the well-known an
chors will he aweigh to the races.
This time it will be "Sink the
Hears." Highly appropriate, any
way, when one stops to remember
how Ebright's crew pulled the
swamp act a year ago at Pough
keepsie.
Hilt, good or bad, the Call-Bul
letin will be cheering llie boys on
to victory, and when the big
classic approaches, stout fella Brick
may claim that Poor Cal will out
play the Cards fifty-nine minutes
«<ut of the sixty. But, win or lose
what t'ell we have the axe.

Pitto's shoes at guard, but will
probably have quite a hard
time doing it. Butch Medanich,
who played well against W.S.C.
last year, will return as a let
tcrman and hold down the
pivot position.
Dolph Timmerman will he back
in bis old berth at tackle, but he
and bis running mate, Beckett, will
be remembered as the ones who
allowed the Stanford backs to run
amuck on off-tackle plays last year.

the campus of the white spike. Who

So far in this football prospects
si lies, all of Stanford's opponents
have been picked to pieces—or just
plain picked. And in the pre-season
iesum6, "Pop" Warner's stalwarts
have heen Riven the edge in every
Conference contest. Now we rise

"What, no spinach!" as Tad
Dorgan used to say. Just so,
the Bears loom up, at present,

Four and the weakest team

feated U.C., 41-6.
Like practically every other
leant in the country, California has
a perfectly Rood lirst string back

line is the bin' factor in any grid
battle, and any team that hasn't a

never gets very far not in West
i 'oast foot ball anyway.
Nine prominent members of
the Price machine will be lost

Barr-Eisan trio has finally
played out its three years in

ingbotltam and the brothers G:
Griffiths, (iarritv, and Gill. The

California should do great stuff in
the backfield until one of 'em gets
injured. Kirwan is a fair substitute
for Ed Griffiths at quarter and Mc-
Cutcheon may see action. Castro is
about the only man to relieve Rusty
Gill at full, but there's Coffiekl, a
good passer. Smith, Hinder, Potter,
and Fritichie that are halves and
may be shifted to help out Hick
ingbothani and Moose Garritv. Hut
