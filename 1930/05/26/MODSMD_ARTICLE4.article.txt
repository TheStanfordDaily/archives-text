# WOMEN'S GYM PLANS CHANGED
## Money For Equipment To Be Raised By Women 
### 
After the refusal of the Board of
Athletic Control to vote more money
to the new women's gymnasium, either
the present plans will have to be al
tered in order to bring the estimated
cost under the $225,000 allotted, or
entirely new plans will have to be
made which will provide for a smaller
building, according to Ernest S. Er
win, University auditor, in charge of
the work.
If it is found possible to cut the
plans satisfactorily, work will contin
ue in a few weeks, but if new plans
have to be drawn up, a wait of at
least six months is assured.
The plans will be reviewed by Er
win, Dr. Dyment, and the architects
this morning to get a preliminary idea
of the possibilities of reducing them
satisfactorily. As it is, the diving pool
has been definitely taken out of the
plans.
'I here is no other possible place be
sides the B.A.C. where it would be
probable that enough money could lie
obtained to use the plans as they are
now, calling for $42,691 more than
the $225,000 already voted.
As it is. the women are expected to
raise $20,000 for furnishings and n.\ni
nasiuni equipment, since that cannot
be taken out of the $225,000.
The contract awarded to George
Wagner for $182,440 was not signed,
so that if it is found necessary to
draw up a new set of plans or change
the existing ones, this amount can be
reduced. Although the plans as they
are now seem best fitted for the needs
of the University, according to Dr.
Bertha Dyment. they will have to be
changed, and it is not improbable that
an entirely new set will be drawn up.
