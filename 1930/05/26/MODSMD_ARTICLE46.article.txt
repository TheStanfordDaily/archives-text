# FELT LAKE FISHING COSTS MEN $12 EACH
## 
### 
Add the eleventh commandment:
Thou shah not tisii in Felt Lake. At
least, that is the warning issued by
police authorities following the arrest
oi three Redwood City men last
Thursday within the forbidden terri
tory. Arraigned before Judge Hardy
in Palo Alto Saturday, F. F. Combs,
J. ( . haston, and K. H. Smith were
each fined $l_' for their fishing ex
pedition, and the saddest part of the
story is that they caught no fish.
