ed in the national intercollegiate
singles and doubles tennis cham
pionships when Captain Larry Hall
and Captain-elect Ted Easton join
ney to Philadelphia to engage in
tiie championships held on the
Marion Cricket Clnb courts, com
mencing June 2:?. Announcement of
. the trip followed action of the
Board of Athletic Control last
Thursday night.
Easton and Hall, regular Card
first doubles team, will go East in
quest of a national doubles title
armed with a formidable one al
ready attained, that of the Pacific
Coast intercollegiate champion
ships. However there is little rea
son to believe that they will brinâ€¢
home the national doubles honors;
since if no other team bests them,
IVleuhleisen and Muench of Calil'or
nia, who are at present, in the lOasi
and who will probably enter ilje
championships, are favored over
the Cards on the basis of two pre
vious triumphs.
Stanford's representatives will
have one decided advantage when
they step onto the courts June l!:i;
their coach. Frank Kagan. who is
now instructing at the German
town Tennis Club, will be able to
lend his coaching assistance, espe
cially in the doubles department,
which lie has been working on par
iticularly all year.
