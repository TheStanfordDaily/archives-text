| A LOST SOUL, IN ALL FRANK
NESS, TO HIS LADY
! (.Is Swinburne iiiiyht have dime it)
Sad, wishing I'd never met von,
Bad, hoping thus to forget you,
1 hopelessly wander in effort tu
squander
the rest of my days with eun
eunteinptuuu-s sneer;
Routing my wits with carousing,
Shouting to make the brain housing
Regrets for your meanness aban
don its keenness,
submerging your lie- in oblivi
ous cheer.
Drunk, bleary-eyed, apathetic,
Sunk to a level'pathetic,
j A hell-fostered nurseling with
never a worse thing
than I have accomplislicd re- '

mauling undone,
Hating the thought of your features,
Mating myself with low creatures,
I frequent all manner of dives,
where the banner
(if Satan is Haunting itself to
the sun.
Reeking with vile bestiality.
Seeking most foul immorality.
Drowning my sorrow and thoughts
of tomorrow,
attempting to blot out the Haul
ing today,
Thus do I scorn* your rejection,
Thus do I ward off dejection,
Lamenting your going (yet all the
time knowing
without that incentive I'd act
the same way).
