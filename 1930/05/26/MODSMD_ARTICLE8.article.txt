# SURVEY DISCLOSES HABITS AND WHIMS OF CAMPUS WOMEN
## 
### 
The Stanford woman is finite the
(globe trotter. This is one of the
; items that has been brought to
| light in the first rough compilation
of the statistics gathered in the
! merchandise survey questionnaire
which is out by the Pub
i lications Council. Using the an
swers sent in by ten per cent of
the women it has been computed
I that the Five Hundred have trav
j eled over two and a half million
, miles ill the last year.
It is to he wondered how much
of this travel lias been done in
I their own cars as approximately
| forty per cent own automobiles.
On looking into their reading
'habits it has been found that the
! "Daily" is the favorite periodical
jof the women, and that in other
I newspapers the comic sections out
'rival sports in catching their inter
est. The Saturday livening Post is
; the most popular magazine, accord
ing to the survey, while Chaparral.
| Literary Digest, and Time vie with
I each other for feminine favor.
[ A considerable number of sectiri
jties are held by Stanford women
j but none will admit playing the
j stock market. Perhaps they would
j possess more if it were not for the
ever-present clothes problem, how-
I ever. Among the astounding maze
ol data gathered on this subject it
' was shown that about half of the
| women have fur coats. More than
3(500 pairs of shoes are bought a
j year, and very nearly a thousand
formal dresses, proving unfounded
I the generally accepted idea that
j Stanford women never date.
The questionnaires sent to the
1 men have not yet been collected. It
is rumored that two men acknowl
edged that their auto body types
! were by Fisher.
