# WOMEN'S GYM MAY BE BUILT BY NOVEMBER
## Cutting Of Present Plans' May Allow Construction To Commence In June Might Eliminate Two Of Three Swimming Pools To Decrease Expenses 
### 
It is quite possible that the women's j
gymnasium can be built without mak- I
ing new plans, which means that ;
building will start in June and be com- .
pleted around November, according j
lei Dr. Bertha Dyment, women's medi- j
eal adviser, who went over the plans 1
yesterday with the architects, Lrucst j
S. Frwin, University auditor, and Ko- j
sainnnd < larke, W.A.A. ex-president.
The plans, which have been in the j
process of being drawn up ever since I
last June wlieii the Board of Athletic 1
Control voted $225,000 lor a new I
women's gymnasium, will have to be j
cut, however, since estimates show :
that it will be impossible to build
under $267,691.
Two of the three swimming pools ;
originally planned will be eliminated. !
and it may be possible to substitute j
cheaper materials and in other ways j
cut down the building expense.
Mthotigh nothing will be definitely
decided before Ahnon F. Roth, in ;
charge of the work, returns Sunday,;
the possibility that new plans will not ;
be necessary is great, and although it j
means giving up things wanted and j
needed, Dr. Dyment believes that the I
changed plans would be more .satisfac
tory than new one*. New plans would
necessitate a wait of another six |
months.
There is no possibility of getting j
more money, since the B.A.C. has dc'f- i
initcl\ decided that they can vote no!
more than $225,000, according to Fr-1
w in, and the plans, as they arc now, '
call for 542.6M1 more. As it is, the i
women are expected to raise $20,000 |
for furnishings and gymnasium equip- |
nient before November since that can- j
not be taken out of the $225,000.
The plan for the gymnasium in- 1
eludes a large gym lloor to be sup
plied with modern equipment, a danc- [
ing studio with offices and dressing •
rooms, a small game room for squash i
and handball, and offices and medical j
rooms on the first floor. The building I
will be constructed around a patio and !
since a kitchen and lounge also go off j
the court it will probably be used for ,
teas and gatherings at intercollegiate i
meets and play days.
Off the entrance to the left are the I
1 acuity offices and to the right arc the j
medical adviser's office and the health i
service rooms. These consist of a nose ]
and throat room, minor surgery, and j
physical therapy. In the latter room i
are to be installed the /.oolites and i
ultra-violets being used this year. j
The swimming yard, which will be!
enclosed bv a wall, will be equipped!
with bleacher's and the pool itself can j
be reached only through the dressing |
room entrance. Tennis courts have i
not been included in the present plans 1
but are expected to be added at a later j
date.
On the second lloor of the building,;
sun porches are planned, a balcony
overlooking the dancing studio, and :
an enclosed shooting range for ar- '
cliery.
The building is to be in the same I
architectural style as the rest of the
Ouad and will face Isolde I lall near
the present medical adviser's office.'
The athletic field.-, and swimming pool
are to be along Coventor's l.ane.

enclosed bv a wall, will be equipped!
with bleacher's and the pool itself can j
be reached only through the dressing |
room entrance. Tennis courts have i
not been included in the present plans 1
but are expected to be added at a later j
date.
On the second lloor of the building,;
sun porches are planned, a balcony
overlooking the dancing studio, and :
an enclosed shooting range for ar- '
cliery.
The building is to be in the same I
architectural style as the rest of the
Ouad and will face Isolde I lall near
the present medical adviser's office.'
The athletic field.-, and swimming pool
are to be along Coventor's l.ane.
It is quite possible that the women's j
gymnasium can be built without mak- I
ing new plans, which means that ;
building will start in June and be com- .
pleted around November, according j
lei Dr. Bertha Dyment, women's medi- j
eal adviser, who went over the plans 1
yesterday with the architects, Lrucst j
S. Frwin, University auditor, and Ko- j
sainnnd < larke, W.A.A. ex-president.
The plans, which have been in the j
process of being drawn up ever since I
last June wlieii the Board of Athletic 1
Control voted $225,000 lor a new I
women's gymnasium, will have to be j
cut, however, since estimates show :
that it will be impossible to build
under $267,691.
Two of the three swimming pools ;
originally planned will be eliminated. !
and it may be possible to substitute j
cheaper materials and in other ways j
cut down the building expense.
Mthotigh nothing will be definitely
decided before Ahnon F. Roth, in ;
charge of the work, returns Sunday,;
the possibility that new plans will not ;
be necessary is great, and although it j
means giving up things wanted and j
needed, Dr. Dyment believes that the I
changed plans would be more .satisfac
tory than new one*. New plans would
necessitate a wait of another six |
months.
There is no possibility of getting j
more money, since the B.A.C. has dc'f- i
initcl\ decided that they can vote no!
more than $225,000, according to Fr-1
w in, and the plans, as they arc now, '
call for 542.6M1 more. As it is, the i
women are expected to raise $20,000 |
for furnishings and gymnasium equip- |
nient before November since that can- j
not be taken out of the $225,000.
The plan for the gymnasium in- 1
eludes a large gym lloor to be sup
plied with modern equipment, a danc- [
ing studio with offices and dressing •
rooms, a small game room for squash i
and handball, and offices and medical j
rooms on the first floor. The building I
will be constructed around a patio and !
since a kitchen and lounge also go off j
the court it will probably be used for ,
teas and gatherings at intercollegiate i
meets and play days.
Off the entrance to the left are the I
1 acuity offices and to the right arc the j
medical adviser's office and the health i
service rooms. These consist of a nose ]
and throat room, minor surgery, and j
physical therapy. In the latter room i
are to be installed the /.oolites and i
ultra-violets being used this year. j
The swimming yard, which will be!
enclosed bv a wall, will be equipped!
with bleacher's and the pool itself can j
be reached only through the dressing |
room entrance. Tennis courts have i
not been included in the present plans 1
