# SUPREME COURT RULES PURCHASERS OF LIQUOR NOT LIABLE TO ARREST
## Judicial Body Holds Buyers of Illegal Liquors Free From From Prosecution Except on Charges of Possession and transportation 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 2(5. (/P) -The buyer of bootleg' liquor was held by '
the Supreme Court today not liable to prosecution as a violator of ;
the prohibition laws if the question of illegal transportation and posses- |
sion be not involved. The court declined, however, in another case, to i
declare whether purchasers who know illegal transportation will be in- |
volved are guilty of conspiracy to violate the prohibition law. It found j
that the cast in which the government had sought to raise that issue I
had been foreclosed by the plea, equivalent to one of guilty, which had j

Sbeen entered when tlie accused
! wiis arraigned.
In a third ease, (he Court held
manufacturers using liquor and al- j
! cohol in the preparation of ;i non- |
beverage products were entitled to j
operate until their permits were ;
cancelled for some violation and j
could not be compelled annually to j
renew their permita.
Government Defeated
'I lie two cases decided on their !
merits were defeats for the govern- j
men), and all three decisions were |
without dissent.
James E. Farrar, of Boston, was i
! indicted for purchasing liquor from j
a bootlegger. The Federal District!
i Court for Massachusetts quashed j
the indictment, taking the position j
that the prohibition law did not, as i
the government had contended, j
make the purchaser equally guilty i
with the seller.
Appeal To Court
The government appealed direct- i
: ly to the Supreme Court, which in j
an opinion by Justice Sutherland, I
declared the contention 1 hat any!
purchase without a permit was il-j
legal could not be sustained. The j
court pointed out that the permit j
related to that class of persons !
, who are authorized to deal with in
toxicating liquors for non-beverage
purposes. Purchasers from bootleg- ;
gens, it added, could not under any i
circumstances obtain a permit to j
make such purchases.
Justice Sutherland stated that.]
"since long before the adoption of
I the 18th Amendment, it has been
held with practical unanimity that,
in the absence of an express statu
tory provision to the contrary, the
purchaser of intoxicating liquor, the
' sale of which was prohibited, was
guilty of no offense."
Suggesting that Congress may
t have considered it more important
i to make the purchaser available as
a witness against the bootlegger,
'the court added it had failed to
'enact any specific legislation mak
ing the purchase of liquor illegal.
Aserting the government for
j many years had not considered the
purchaser guilty, the Justice con
cluded Congress in enacting the
Volstead Act had "deliberately and
j designedly omitted to impose upon
j the purchaser of liquor for bever
age purposes any criminal liabil
. ily."
