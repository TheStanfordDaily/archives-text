## Question Will Probably Be Settled By End Of This Quarter Changes Suggested For Fall Quarter 
### 
. . !
; Tlic women's lockout revision plan
i which was passed by Conference I'Ti- '
i day has been considered by Dean Mary j
j Yost and will go with her suggestions |
to Acting President Robert K. Swain,
I some time this week. Pinal action by
' the administration is expected this
j quarter.
| " There is no reason why the situa- j
tion should not be handled hi fore tin*
j end of the quarter," said President
j Swain, and Dean Yosi declared that i
I every effort would be made to do so.
i It is possible that President Swain'
j may call a meeting of Conference it
I there are any suggestions or rcvi-
I sions the administration should want j
! considered.
The most outstanding changes of
l tiie proposed plan are automatic 2 :30 I
j leaves on the week-ends, a ratio of j
j automatic 11:30 leaves, 3 for fresh- |
i man, and X for other classes, and spe- j
j cial 2:30 midweek leaves.
Highway Rule
The present highway rule which
| specifics that "except as a means of j
j conveyance between their homes and
; the campus, or Palo Alto and the
campus, first-quarter freshman women
i may not motor off campus after dark
: unless accompanied by another Stan- '
| ford woman," was abolished by a
' unanimous vote.
Another new regulation which was
I voted by Conference to take effect;
j with the class oi 1933 was the decision 1
j that no woman could hold more than
one of the following major offices at
one time: member of Council, mcin
\ her of A.S.S.I'. Executive Committee,
j Women's Kditor of Daily, Kditor or
| Junior Kditor of Quad, W.A.A. Prt -i
! dent, Y.W.C.A. president. General
! Manager of Quad. Daily. Concert Se
; rics, etc. (not Women's Manager).
Discontent with the present regu
! lations was first brought to a head
i some weeks ago when a petition for
I an A.. W.S. assembly to discuss the
; matter was circulated. Since the Con
j ference has met and appointed a lock
! out committee which has drawn up a
J complete report passed by Confcr
j encc and submitted to the Administra
i tion. The new system is not expected
jto be put into effect until next Pall
[ quarter.
Dissatisfaction
The dissatisfaction with the prc
| sent lockout rules is caused, accord-
I ing to the committee report, primarily
j because there are no late leave privi
leges during the week for those who
jgo t<> San Francisco for dancing on
j when the lloor is less crowded,
I and also, because the I:30 limit on
! week ends causes the many who yn to
i the t it} to speed down the highwax
] instead of making an incoiiveiiicnll
, early return to the campus.
The first plan attempted by the coin
inittcc pas a plan for no regulation
; for juniors, senior and graduates.
with sufficient rules during the first
! two years that a knowledge of campus
: standards of conduct might be cstab-
I fished with cadi individual and with
(additional precautionary machinery
| (health and scholarship checks) so
that abuts of the proposed freedom
I might be prevented as far as possible.
However, the committee agreed that
the present living regulations would
I not make this plan advisable.

i day has been considered by Dean Mary j
j Yost and will go with her suggestions |
to Acting President Robert K. Swain,
I some time this week. Pinal action by

I every effort would be made to do so.
i It is possible that President Swain'

The most outstanding changes of
l tiie proposed plan are automatic 2 :30 I
j leaves on the week-ends, a ratio of j
j automatic 11:30 leaves, 3 for fresh- |
i man, and X for other classes, and spe- j
j cial 2:30 midweek leaves.
Highway Rule
The present highway rule which

j conveyance between their homes and
; the campus, or Palo Alto and the
campus, first-quarter freshman women
i may not motor off campus after dark
: unless accompanied by another Stan- '
| ford woman," was abolished by a
' unanimous vote.
Another new regulation which was
I voted by Conference to take effect;
j with the class oi 1933 was the decision 1
j that no woman could hold more than
one of the following major offices at
one time: member of Council, mcin
\ her of A.S.S.I'. Executive Committee,

Discontent with the present regu

i some weeks ago when a petition for
