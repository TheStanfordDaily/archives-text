# Stanford Women's Destiny Decided In Five Short Minutes
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
Five short minutes in June ot 1903 ;
j decided the destiny of women at Stau
i ford.
| The Univcrsilj had been founded
| in 1891. Leland Stanford liad died in!
1X94. Litigation complications had
i been many. The number of women had ;
been limited to in 1899.
It was now the moment when Mrs.
Leland Stanford was to surrender ail
'of her powers over the University to j
the, Hoard of Trustees. A eonstitu- ,
tional amendment had been passed to j
i legalize this procedure.
It was June 1. In the library of j
the Stanford home in San Francisco i
were gathered together those in whom i
I lie entire control of the University
j lay.
The light shone through the big bay j
window on the library table on which
was Mrs. Stanford's resignation. He
side the woman founder was sitting;
Judge George H. Urothers, who lia'd
prepared the legislation by which Mrs.
! Stanford was to relinquish her pow
ers before her death. Seated in rows
at the end of the table were the trus
tees.
Mrs. .Stanford rose. She read an
address which she hud previously
shown to Mr. C rot hers as her legal
adviser, and then, to his intense sur
prise, picked up another document
which "dealt with many matters of de
tail and many personalities at the Uni
j versity."
In an atmosphere tense with amazc
! incut, she ended this speech with the
j statement that she had caused Sena
tor Stanford to provide equal advan
tages for the women at the Univer
sity: and that sir' had therefore lim
j ited the number of women to S(JO. She
'then expressed the hope that if the
Trustees should ever conclude that
! co-education was a failure, they
should abolish it.
Mrs. Stanford then readied toward
the table for her resignation which
wa lying before her. The destinies
; of over 4000 women who were sub
sequently to be students at Stanford
I nivcr>it.\ hung in those few seconds.
Mr. (rothers rose, lie stated that
| he believed that there was suinc mis-
I understanding, and requested that a
livc-minttie recess be granted.
In the next five minutes, lie ex
plained to the woman founder that if
she really desired the Trustees to have
i the power of eliminating women stu
dents at tin' University, it would be
necessary for her to execute an
amendment to that effect before pre
senting iier resignation. He expressed
doubt as to the wisdom of making
sue I) a radical change in the charter of
the University, as it had been given
extraordinary privileges by the state
without the public's being aware that
she had the power to change "the ob
ject, nature, and purposes of the insti
tution."
Mrs. Stanford contemplated and
thereupon said that the trusts would
remain as they were. The meeting
came to order.
Mrs. Stan lord's resignation was
read, and the I'ivc I lundrcd remained
in the charter ot Stanford University.
This incident in the history of Stan
lord women was told by former Judge
(Jcorge \i. Urothcrs, who was the first
Stanford graduate to serve mi the
I'oard of Trustees, and who guided
the legal fate of Stanford through
some of its most trying years.
In the spring of 1K ( »8 he was asked
by the woman founder to formulate a
constitutional amendment to exempt
the University from taxation and
thereby enable her to transfer a quar
tcr interest in the Southern Pacific to
Stanford. In the following years until
the legal status o! Stanlord became
fairly stationary he was very close to
Mrs. Stanford.

Five short minutes in June ot 1903 ;
j decided the destiny of women at Stau
i ford.
| The Univcrsilj had been founded
| in 1891. Leland Stanford liad died in!
1X94. Litigation complications had
i been many. The number of women had ;
been limited to in 1899.
It was now the moment when Mrs.
Leland Stanford was to surrender ail
'of her powers over the University to j
the, Hoard of Trustees. A eonstitu- ,
tional amendment had been passed to j
i legalize this procedure.
It was June 1. In the library of j
the Stanford home in San Francisco i
were gathered together those in whom i
I lie entire control of the University
j lay.
The light shone through the big bay j
window on the library table on which
was Mrs. Stanford's resignation. He
side the woman founder was sitting;
Judge George H. Urothers, who lia'd
prepared the legislation by which Mrs.
! Stanford was to relinquish her pow
ers before her death. Seated in rows
at the end of the table were the trus
tees.
Mrs. .Stanford rose. She read an
address which she hud previously
shown to Mr. C rot hers as her legal
adviser, and then, to his intense sur
prise, picked up another document
which "dealt with many matters of de
tail and many personalities at the Uni
j versity."
In an atmosphere tense with amazc
! incut, she ended this speech with the
j statement that she had caused Sena
tor Stanford to provide equal advan
tages for the women at the Univer
sity: and that sir' had therefore lim
j ited the number of women to S(JO. She
'then expressed the hope that if the
Trustees should ever conclude that
! co-education was a failure, they
should abolish it.
Mrs. Stanford then readied toward
the table for her resignation which
wa lying before her. The destinies
; of over 4000 women who were sub
sequently to be students at Stanford
I nivcr>it.\ hung in those few seconds.
Mr. (rothers rose, lie stated that
| he believed that there was suinc mis-
I understanding, and requested that a
livc-minttie recess be granted.
In the next five minutes, lie ex
plained to the woman founder that if
she really desired the Trustees to have
i the power of eliminating women stu
dents at tin' University, it would be
necessary for her to execute an
amendment to that effect before pre
senting iier resignation. He expressed
doubt as to the wisdom of making
sue I) a radical change in the charter of
the University, as it had been given
extraordinary privileges by the state
without the public's being aware that
she had the power to change "the ob
ject, nature, and purposes of the insti
tution."
Mrs. Stanford contemplated and
thereupon said that the trusts would
remain as they were. The meeting
came to order.
Mrs. Stan lord's resignation was
read, and the I'ivc I lundrcd remained
in the charter ot Stanford University.
This incident in the history of Stan
lord women was told by former Judge
(Jcorge \i. Urothcrs, who was the first
Stanford graduate to serve mi the
I'oard of Trustees, and who guided
the legal fate of Stanford through
some of its most trying years.
In the spring of 1K ( »8 he was asked
by the woman founder to formulate a
constitutional amendment to exempt
the University from taxation and
thereby enable her to transfer a quar
tcr interest in the Southern Pacific to
Stanford. In the following years until
the legal status o! Stanlord became
fairly stationary he was very close to
Mrs. Stanford.
