### Sylva Weaver 
Five short minutes in June ot 1903 ;
j decided the destiny of women at Stau
i ford.
| The Univcrsilj had been founded
| in 1891. Leland Stanford liad died in!
1X94. Litigation complications had
i been many. The number of women had ;
been limited to in 1899.
It was now the moment when Mrs.
Leland Stanford was to surrender ail
'of her powers over the University to j
the, Hoard of Trustees. A eonstitu- ,
tional amendment had been passed to j
i legalize this procedure.
It was June 1. In the library of j
the Stanford home in San Francisco i
were gathered together those in whom i

'then expressed the hope that if the
Trustees should ever conclude that
! co-education was a failure, they
should abolish it.
Mrs. Stanford then readied toward
the table for her resignation which
wa lying before her. The destinies
; of over 4000 women who were sub

Mr. (rothers rose, lie stated that
| he believed that there was suinc mis-
I understanding, and requested that a
livc-minttie recess be granted.
In the next five minutes, lie ex
plained to the woman founder that if
she really desired the Trustees to have
i the power of eliminating women stu

necessary for her to execute an
amendment to that effect before pre

doubt as to the wisdom of making
