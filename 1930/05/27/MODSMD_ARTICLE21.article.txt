1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol

for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as

Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."

created provided that "any person in
