# POSSIBLE INCREASE OF "500" FOUND IN GROWER'S REPORT
## Maintenance of a Women's College in Affiliation With The University Would Be in Harmony With Stanford Trusts, Says Lawyer 
### 
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."

Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so

Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."

Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."

Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti

Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
I 010 VIOLATION" of the origin of flu- 500 limit and the legal status if .i
1 "new women's college was made last night by former Judge George 10.
(Yotliers of San Francisco, who was the lir.st Stanford graduate to serve
on tin* Hoard of Trustees.
In a thorough legal investigation of the Five' Hundred, Crothers has
! made it clear that the maintenance of a women's college affiliated with
: the University is a real possibility and is in harmony with the pur
poses of the Stanford trusts.
i (brothers was asked by Mrs. Leland Stanford in 1898 to formulate a
I constitutional amendment to exempt the University property from taxa
! lion. From this time until the woman founder's death in 15)05, ('rothers

was active in the litigation of the
Stanford trusts. He is author of
legislation, various grants, amend
ments, and other documents, con
cerning the legal status of Stan
ford.
Through a maze of legal tangles,
("rothers has traced the status of
women students at Stanford. Fol
lowing is the report which he lias
made for the Daily:
Kjjjtor's Nqtk.— //ns Ti'r; y com
/■lt'll' discussion of the 500 limitation
has been prepared by former Judge
(ieorge li. Crothcrs of San / rancisco
for the Daily. /Is a member of the
Hoard of Trustees until /V/ 2 and as
side active trustee during the period
Mrs. Stanford aas involved in litiga
lion over the I nivcrsity, he is zirell
equipped to reveal the status of the
hive Hundred and the real possibility
of alUnving more ■women to enter
Stanford.
The answer to the question is made
easier by the publication of the quota
tions from the Founding Grant and
amendment of May 31. 1899, limitinv.
the number of women to live hundred.
At the time there was a question as
to whether Mrs. Stanford possessed
any power to amend the trusts o!
Stanford University other than such
as might have been derived from the
clause in the Constitutional Amend
incut which provided that "the trust >
and estates created for the founding,
endowment and maintenance of tin-
Leland Stanford Junior University,
under and in accordance with 'An Act
to advance learning, etc.,' . . . and by
the amendments of such grant, and
by gifts, grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto, and by confir
matory grants, are permitted, ap
proved and con firmed."
Powers Pass to Mrs. Stanford
The Fnabling Act of March 9. 18K.\
under which the Stanford trust was
created provided that "any person in
his lifetime" might found and endow
a university, etc., "by a grant in writ
ing," in which certain very extraordi
nary powers not otherwise permissible
could he reserved to himself during
his lifetime, and to his wife in case
she should survive him.
Section 5 of the Fnabling Act pro
vided that "the person making such
grant, by a provision therein, may
elect, in relation to the property con
veyed and in relation to the erection,
maintenance and management of such
institution or institutions, to perform,
during his life, all the duties and e>.
[ ereise all the powers which, by the
terms of the grant, are enjoined Upon
and vested in the trustee or trustees
therein named. If the person making
such grant, and making the election
aforesaid, be a married person, such
person may further provide iiiat if
the wifi! of such person survive him.
then such wife, during her life, may,
in relation to the property conveyed,
and in relation to the erection, main
ti nance, and management of such in
stitution or institutions, perform all
the duties and exercise all the powers
which, by the terms of the grant, arc '
enjoined upon and vested in the trus
tee or trustees therein named. . . ."
Reserve Right to Alter
of Setcion 6, which the grantor or
vided that—
"The person making such grant
may therein reserve the right to |
alter, amend or modify the terms 1
■ and conditions thereof and the
;; trusts therein created, in respect
to any of the matters mentioned
or referred to in subdivisions one
to six inclusive, of section two
(three) hereof; and may also
therein reserve the right, during
the life of such person or per
sons, of absolute dominion over
the personal property conveyed,
and also over the rents, issues,
and profits of the real property
conveyed, without liability to ac
count therefor in any manner |
! whatever and without any liability
over against the estate of such
person; and if any such person be
married, such person may, in said
grant, further provide that if his
1 wife survive him, then such wife,
during her life, may have the j
' same absolute dominion over such
' personal property, and such rents,
[■: issues and profits, without liability
to account therefor in any niau
j ner whatever, and without lia
bility over against the estate of
either of the spouses."
It will be observed that in Sections
5 and 6 meticulous care > s taken to
permit the founder to reserve to him
self during his lifetime, and then to
his wife upon his death during her
lifetime, all of the powers enumerated
therein, excepting the power to amend
the trusts referred to in the lirst pari '
of Sction 6, which the grantor or j
grantors may reserve to himself or
themselves.
Stanfords Joint Grantors
Turning to Division XII of the
' original Founding Grant, dated No- j
vembcr 14, 1885, we.find that Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford, purporting to
J act as joint grantors and not merely
as husband and wife, make the fol
lowing reservation of the right to
■ amend the trusts by joint action dur
ing their lives, and by individual j
action during the life of the survivor
of them. That provision reads as fol
lows :
"The grantors hereby reserve to i
themselves during their lives, and
hereby reserve and grant to the
one who shall survive the other,
during his or her life, the right to J
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of this grant, and
the trusts therein created, in re
spect to the nature, object and i
purposes of the institution found
ed, the powers and duties of the
Trustees, the manner in which,
and to whom, they shall account,
the mode and manner, and by
whom their successors shall be ap
pointed, the rules and regulations
for the management of the prop
erty conveyed, the time when, and
the character and extent of, the |
buildings which shall be erected,
the right to provide for trades j
and professions which shall be |
taught in the institution, and the
terms upon which scholarships
shall be founded."
Right to Alter Questioned
Under the provisions of the En- 1
abling Act the singular included
the plural and the masculine the
feminine, but there was a question
as to whether even joint grantors
could reserve the right to amend,
or any of the powers of the Board
of Trustees, to the survivor or
survivors of them, as such, inde
pendently of the provision relative
to the right to reserve powers to
a surviving wife.
There was also a question as to,
whether Mrs. Stanford could claim j
the status of joint founder or grantor, |
or other than that of an assenting
spouse under the Knabling Act, and
whether her reserved powers affected
the sufficiency of her assent to the
grant required by the Act, in view of j
the declaration in the grant itself that
the property conveyed was community |
property which, at that time and until
recently, was held to he the absolute
property of the husband and as the
Enabling Act required was property
. "belonging" to him, in which a widow
„ acquired her interest by inheritance j
, from a deceased husband.
Bequest Complicates
But the foregoing questions became;
jiluore complicated when Senator Stan
•ford gave the University two and a
half millions by will instead of by
■"grant" in writing "in his lifetime,"
to which Mrs. Stanford, as reisduary
legatee, assented upon an express
Agreement with the trustees that it
B'nould be held subject to all of her (
Reserved powers. In subsequent con- j
Teyances, culminating in her deed and
gift of May 31, 189'', she conveyed to j
the I hiivcrsily the great bulk of its
•resell! endowment, subject to all of j
lier reserved powers, and also to the j
precisions of various "addresses" in
file, form of directions and amend
tn« nt> to the trusts. Among the
amendments contained in her address
of May 31, 1899. is the following lim
iting the number of women at the
University:
A "There is another subject upon
which I feel deeply, and I speak
of it at present, because this may j
be my last opportunity of meeting
you face to face; Whereas the.
University was founded in mem- I
ory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, under |
the power given nic in the original
grant, that the number of women
attending the University as stu
dents shall at no time ever exceed
five hundred.

' "I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same fate, the number of worn
! en students will, before very long,
greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
i the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's."
Reiterates Amendments
Mrs. Stanford reiterated a number
| of her amendments to the trust in the
deed of May 31. 1899, including that
| quoted above limiting the number of
I women at the University. That deed
I is made expressly upon the trust pro
vided for in the bounding Grant "and
■ certain other trusts, uses, intents, and
i purposes hereinafter expressed, de
■ dared or limited," and among those
other trusts referred to were the par
agraphs concerning the limitation of
women, excepting that the last words,
j "nor would it have been my son's" do
not appear in the deed.
j ller reservations of powers of May
131, 1899, are in part as follows:
"I do hereby reserve to myself,
during my life, all of the rights,
powers and authority that were
reserved by or to said Leland
St.yiford and myself, or either
of us, in, or by means, or by vir
tue of, said grant made and exe
cuted by us to said Lorenzo Saw
yer and others as Trustees as
aforesaid, on the eleventh day of
November, A.D. 1885; and also
the further right, power and au
thority to grant, bargain, sell, eon
-1 vey or lease the real property
herein described, and hereby
granted to said Trustees, in trust,
and to ileal with said property as
fully, in all respects, during my
life as I could do were this in
, denture, grant, conveyance and
transfer not made or executed.
And I shall not * . r shall my ex
ecutors or adn. istrators, or my
estate be made responsible to, or
be required to account to, said
Trustees, or to the Board of
I Trustees, or to any person whom
soever, for, or on the account of,
the said personal property, or the
rents, issues, income or profits
i thereof, or for or on account of
the proceeds arising from any sale
or other disposition as aforesaid,
of said real or personal property,
or* from the rents, issues, income
o; - profits of said real or personal
property."
Grant Assured Approval
This deed of May 31, 1899, was
made by Mrs. Stanford upon my
assurance that the Constitutional
Amendment which had shortly before
been adopted by the Legislature for
submission to the people, was prac
tically assured of passage and, aside
' from its provision for tax exemption,
would remove any doubt as to the
validity of the University titles, if
proper reconveyances were made un
der its express terms after its adop
i tion by the people on November 6,
1900, although it was pointed out to
her that it might not validate any
: amendments and especially any there
! after made by her, or any amend
ments conflicting with general law.
Accordingly, she delivered the deed
of May 31, 1899, but at my sugges
tion inserted the. following clause to
avoid the danger of the questions con
cerning reserved powers sought to
be settled by the Constitutional
Amendment:
"And it is hereby covenanted
and agreed by and between the
parties of this indenture, and it is
their intention, that the full and
complete legal title in and to the
property herein described, or so
intended to be, shall vest in said
Trustees and their successors, in
trust as herein expressed; and
that if any of the covenants, con
ditions or reservations herein con
tained be inconsistent with the
holding of such legal title to any
part, pared or holding of said
property by said Trustees, in trust
as herein expressed, then it is the
intention of the parties hereto
that such legal title shall be para
mount and superior to said cove
nants, conditions and reservations,
or any or either of them, and to
any right, power or authority that.
I may, by virtue thereof, exer
cise."
r;\L TURKIC CROTIIKRS .... )
Withdraw Trust Properties
I'uisuant to Mrs. Stanford's di
rections I prepared the great deeds
of reconveyance of December 9. 1901,
covering the entire endowment of the
University other than certain prop
erties which Mrs. Stanford had with
drawn fVoni the trust. Those deeds,
a photographic copy of one of which
will be seen in the 1905 (Jtiad which
was dedicated to me as its drafter,
contain no express reservations of
powers whatever to Mrs. Stanford,
hut those deeds were made under and
pursuant to the second sentence of the
Constitutional Amendment and upon
the assumption that all powers vest
ing in Mrs. Stanford prior to the
adoption of the Amendment, and all
reservations of power to Mrs. Stan
ford in the bounding Grant which
may have been validated by the con
torniaton. clause of the Constitutional
Amendment, would remain in full
force and effect, without the neces
sity of any reservation or reference
relative thereto.
Waived Amendment Power
Those three deeds contain the fol
lowing clauses which Mrs. Stanford
understood might constitute a waiver
of her power of amendment if not
valid originally and not confirmed;

so that in no case should the passage
of the title to the properties be af
l'ccted thereby:
"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
all of said property by the trus
ties of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University in trust for the
maintenance and benefit of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity, upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests and devises
supplementary thereto, within the
meaning of the above words read
ing, 'upon the trusts provided for
in the grant founding the Uni
versity, and amendments thereof,
and grants, bequests, and devises
supplementary thereto,' as s*uch
words are used in said constitu
tional amendment.
"Nothing contained in this
grant shall he construed to be a
grant or gift of any property not
herein referred to, described or
designated.
No Inconsistencies
"This grant shall not be defeat
ed by the invalidity of any of the
trusts herein provided for, or by
the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said Trustees,
of the legal title to any portion
of said property, in trust as here
in provided, then it is my inten
tion that such power or powers
shall be so limited as to permit
of the vesting of such legal title;
and, in either event, I hereby
grant said property upon such
trusts and terms hercyi provided
as are valid, and prescribe that the
legal title shall vest in the said
Trustees accordingly."
Trustees Take Charge
The second sentence of the Con
stitutional Amendment quoted in these
deeds provides for the conveyance of
property to the trustees subsequent to
tlie adoption of the amendment, and
is as follows:
"The board of trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the trustees, or of
the institution, may receive prop
erty, real or personal, and wher
ever situated, by gift, grant, de
vise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
shall be held by the trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the uni
versity, and amendments there
of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto."
Immediately after the execution and
delivery of the deeds of December 9,
1901, Mrs. Stanford requested me to
go over all her amendments and di
rections to the Trustees, and to pre
pare for her consideration a complete
revision thereof from both a techni
cal and practical standpoint. With
the exception of a few added para
graphs and slight changes in phrase
ology, the result is to be found in the
amendments of October 3, 1902, a
careful reading of which will show
that in the main it is a withdrawal of
obsolete or technically or practically
undesirable directions theretofore
made as amendments to the Univer
sity trusts. That document contains
the last series of amendments execut
ed by Mrs. Stanford, but makes no
direct reference to the question of the
number of women at the University,
though it may have the indirect effect
hereafter mentioned.
To Transfer Power
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford ex
pressed a desire to surrender all of
her powers over the University, and
upon my statement that it would re
quire legislation to enable the Trustees
to assume their powers prior to her
death, she suggested that I secure such
legislation. At the same time 112 wrote
an Act, the purpose of which is indi
cated in its title, which reads, "An
act to provide for proceedings for the
ascertainment of the existence and
terms of. and for the determination of
the validity and legal effcct of grants
or other instruments creating, chang
ing or affecting trusts and estates for
the founding, endowment and mainte
nance of a university, college, school,
seminary of learning, mechanical insti
tute, musium, gallery of art, or li
brary, or any other institution, or any
or all thereof, under or pursuant to
an act entitled 'An Act to advance
learning, . . .' approved March 9, 1885.
. . . (Approved February 10, 190.3.
Stats. 190.?, p. 9.)"
Mrs. Stanford Resigns
Mrs. Stanford set June lirst as the
date for her resignation of all pow
ers in. over and concerning the Uni
versity and its trusts. Before that date
she submitted to me an address which
did not purport to affect or change
the trusts, and she had previously ap
proved a form of resignation pre
pared by us for her signature. At her
request I sat beside her at the tabic
in the bay window of her library in
her home in San Francisco, while the
Trustees sat in rows at the other side
of the table. She arose and read the
address which she had submitted to
me, and then, to my surprise, took
up another document which dealt
with many matters of detail and
many personalities at the Univer
sity. and ended with the statement
that she had caused Senator Stan
ford to provide the admission of
and equal advantages for women
at the University, that she had
theretofore limited the number to
five hundred, and expressed the
hope that if the Trustees should
ever conclude that co-education
was a failure, they should abolish
it. Knowing that the Trustees had
no such power unless she should
amend the trusts lie fore she presented
her resignation, which lay before her
and which she was about to up

and read, I stated that 1 believed that
there was a misunderstanding, and
requested a five-minute recess, during
which time I explained to Mrs. Stan
ford that if she really desired the
Trustees to have the power to elimi
nate women students at the Univer
sity, it would l»c necessary for her to
execute an amendment to that effect
before presenting her resignation. At
the same time I expressed duubt as
to the wisdom of making such a radi
cal change in the charter of the Uni
versity, in view of the fact that it
had been given extraordinary privi
leges without the public being aware
of the fact that she possessed the pow
er to change the object, nature and
purposes of the institution. She there
upon said that she would allow the
trusts to stand as they were in that
regard, and took up her resignation
and read it to the Trustees. I felt
that even if co-education should
prove to be a failure, there was
nothing in the charter that pro
hibited the maintenance of a sepa
rate college for five hundred
women, the only problem being the
matter of expense "to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." But I
also felt that her fears were not well
founded, as the conditions at the Uni
versity during my college generation
seemed to me to be little short of
ideal. I had in mind, but did not
mention the fact, that it might be held
in the proposed judicial proceeding
that the confirmatory clause of the
Constitutional Amendment might not
be construed to validate her power of
amendment, as not being reserved "un
der and in accordance with" the En
abling Act, or might be construed to
validate only those amendments made
prior to its adoption by the Legisla
ture or by the people, and I did not
like to sec the issues raised.
511 Typewritten Pages
The petition in the special proceed
ing which my brother and I had been
preparing for months, consisting of
511 typewritten pages, was tiled on
the 16th day of the same month, and
the decree establishing the trusts and
titles, including the amendment limit
ing the number of women, consisting
of 172 typewritten pages, was signed
July 3, and filed July 6, 1903, and I
believe that there is no possible ave
nue of attack open against either the
titles or the trusts of the University
as determined in that decree, although
the trusts arc from time to time open
to construction by the Superior Court
at San Jose, which has jurisdiction of
the trust.
But the right of other donors
to establish and endow a women's
college in affiliation with Stanford
University and under the control
of its trustees may turn upon the
technical nature of the Stanford
foundation. The Knabling Act by its
express terms provided only for the
original founding and endowment of
"a university, college, school, semi
nary of learning, mechanical institute,
museum or gallery of art, or any or
all thereof." It created or provided
for no legal entity either in the Board
of Trustees or in the University, and,
except as the founder or founders
might supplement their grant to the
identical trustees upon identical trusts,
any subsequent grants or gifts to the
trustees vested in them as ordinary
trustees under the general rules of
equity governing eleemosynary trusts
independently of the founding grant
or subsequent gifts, unless by their
terms they were to be merged with
the original endowment. This situa
tion I remedied by the third sentence
of the Constitutional Amendment
(Article IX, Section 10) and the pro
ceedings taken pursuant thereto,
whereby the trustees were enabled to
perform their trust duties as if in
corporated.
Consolidate Endowments
The reconveyance by Mrs. Stan
ford of December 9. 1901, and the
terms of the Constitutional Amend
ment incorporated by reference there
in, and the decree already referred to,
resulted in th consolidation of all the
endowment properties of the founders
into a single trust, and under the sec
ond sentence of the Constitutional
Amendment all subsequent gifts fall
into the same trust unless there is a
provision to the contrary in the re
spective trust instruments.
Hut notwithstanding the granting of
corporate powers to the trustees and
the provisions designed to permit and
encourage the consolidation of past
and future endowments into one fund,
under one Board of Trustees and
identical trust provisions, except as
otherwise provided for donors, the
Stanford University endowment is

still held by the trustees, as such, and
not by the Board of Trustees, as such,
or as a corporate body. In providing
for corporate powers, I expressly pro
vided that the Legislature should not
alter the tenure or limit the powers
or obligations of the trustees, as such.
That provision of the Constitutional
Amendment is as follow*:
"The Legislature, by special act,
may grant to the trustees of the
j Lcland Stanford junior Univcr
j sity corporate powers and privi
leges, but it shall not thereby alter
their tenure, or limit their pow
ers or obligations a* trustees."
Documentary Study Needed
Whether or not an entirely scpa- j
rate series of trusts may be created
in the same trustees and their sue- j
cessors for the foundation and endow
ment of a great girls' college can best
'be judged by a careful study of the
' documents which 1 have quoted. Nei
ther the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni i
versity, as such, nor the Board of i
Trustees, as such, is a legal entity, but j
are dependent upon the trusts and i
titles vesting in individual trustees j
with respect to various gift # s which
have been in the main consolidated I
into the major trust as created and
amended by the Stanfords. The .
terms of those trusts must be car- :
ricd out in good faith, but other
| trusts not inconsistent with them
I may be created in the same trus- ;
tees.
#
As already indicated the Knabling !
Act merely provided for the founding
of the institution "by grant in writ
ing" to a trustee or trustees named
therein by "any person desiring, in
his lifetime, to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained, within this State,
a university, college, school, seminary
of learning, mechanical institute, mu
seum, or gallery of art, or any or all
thereof."
Broad in Power
I The founding (jrant was a little
j broader and provided that the trus
i tees shall have power:
"To, in their discretion, receive
! (/ranis of property from others
in aid of the institution founded,
or to establish Scholarships there
in,—providing the same are made
i upon terms and conditions in har
mony with the purposes of the
j Institution as herein declared.
"To receive from the grantors,
i or either of them, by grant or
devise, such other property as
the grantors or either of them
I may hereafter elect to give, and
to hold such property upon the
! same conditions and to the same
uses and trusts, as are herein prc-
I scribed."
Broad Acceptance Powers
To make the trusts conform to the
; broad powers as to the reception of
property by the trustees by any form
I of conveyance contained in the Consti-
I tutional Amendment and the corporate
| powers conferred and asuTned pursu
ant thereto, we drafted an amendment
!to the trusts of October 3, 1902, as
j follows :
"The Board of Trustees of the
! Lcland Stanford Junior Univcr
i sity, as such, or in the name of
the institution, or by other intel
ligible designation of the trustees
or of the institution may receive
property, real or personal, and
wherever situated, by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, for the benefit
of the institution, or of any de
partment thereof, and such prop
erty, unless otherwise provided,
j shall be held by the Trustees of
the Lcland Stanford Junior Uni
versity upon the trusts provided
for in the grant founding the
University, and amendments there
j of, and grants, bequests, and de
vises supplementary thereto, with
in, the meaning of Article IX,
! Section 10, of the Constitution of
I the State of California."
i All of the foregoing trust provisions
I relative to the acceptance of future
i gifts are in full effect except as the
j earlier must yield to the later in date
| in so far as necessary to give the later
i full force and effect.
Powers Enlarged
It will he seen that the powers of
j the trustees to receive have been
greatly enlarged and the question now
! presented is whether the maintenance
| of a great women's college under a
! separate endowment is in harmony
j with the purposes and organization
] of the present institution.
i Under the Stanford trusts co-
I education is not expressly pro
! vided for and is probably not tech
-1 nically obligatory. The Founding
: Grant provides that "the trustees
i shall have power, and it shall be
their duty, ... to afford equal fa
i cilitics and give equal advantages
; in the University to both the sex
es," and the. amendment by Mrs.
Stanford merely limits the number
I of. women at the University without
j otherwise affecting the original re
; quirement of equal advantages and
facilities. But the expression "uni
S versity" is a broad term, and may
j embody various colleges and "semi
, uarics of learning."
Division I of the hounding (Irani
! dclines the scope of the institution a.i
j follows:
"The nature, object, and pur
poses of the institution herein
founded, to be:
"Its nature, that of a university
• with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the. highest
i grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani
i cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind :
To Direct Students
"Its object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and di
rect usefulness in life;
'
"And its purposes, to promote

the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights uf man to lite,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
May Maintain Seminaries
Following is one of the amend
nents to the trusts dated October 3,
90.?, which indicates that the Univer
itv may maintain "colleges, schools,
eminaries of learning, etc.," and may
icrinit such a construction of the
Diversity trusts as would allow the
rcation of a separate women's eol
i'ge a* an affiliated institution. The
übordination of Mrs. Stanford's
mendment to her main purpose, in
ase that should be found to be nec
ssary tor technical reasons, is also
indicated in the same amendment,
vhich reads:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of the Lcland Stanford Junior
University to promote the public
welfare by founding, endowing
and having maintained a Univer
sity with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechani
cal institutes, museums, galleries
of art, and all other things neces
sary and appropriate to a Uni
versity of high degree, all other
directions or reservations in the
hounding Grant and all amend
ments «r attempted amendments
thereof by the bounders, or by
the survivor of them, shall be
deemed incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose,
and the invalidity of any direc
tion, or attempted amendment, or
'of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or here
after made to the University, or
to the I rustees thereof, or of tlve
directions herein or heretofore
made, as far as such directions are
otherwise valid; ami if any such
directions or attempted amend
ments are found not to be legal
or binding, they may, notwith
standing, he regarded as advisory
or permissive so far as they shall
be capable of execution."
The expression "equal advantages

and facilities" may not imply iden
tical advantages and facilities, and is
i probably open to such a construction
j as would make the expression read in
substance "to afford equal facilities
! and give equal advantages in the Uni-
I versity to both sexes considering their
j respective requirements in view of
! the different physical structure and
i the requirements for the anticipated
i callings and future conditions and
i duties of life of the majority in each
' group."
j Stanford University is no longer
I contincd to the Palo Alto Farm.
Among the amendments of October
| 3, 1902, is one providing that "in so
far as necessary, or the nature of the
lease requires, instruction and investi
gation, together with suitable facili
ties therefor, may be maintained else
| where than upon the Palo Alto harm."
Growth Foreseen
In formulating this I had in mind
I an eventual medical school, agricul
| tural and other experimentation, and
j the possibility that Stanford Univcr-
I sity might eventually take over Mills
j College as an affiliated college or as
a separate academic entity. In like
manner the trustees can probably ac
j cept endowments for entirely inde
; pendent or affiliated colleges for men
} or women.
The possible invalidity of the
'amendment limiting women to five
I hundred has been suggested. Some
(of the purported amendments of Mrs.
I Stanford were beyond the power of
! amendment permitted by either the
Enabling Act or Founding Grant to a
! founder, and others conflicted with
j general laws and were eliminated by
! amendment on October 3, 1902, or by
| the decree in the special proceeding
| referred to, but no such objection can
, be raised to that relative to the num
j her of women at the University.
• Amendment Valid
If any of Mrs. Stanford's* amend
ments made after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment by the
Legislature and before its adoption by
the people was valid, that limiting
i women to five hundred was valid,
1 and, if not originally valid or vali
dated by the Constitutional Amcnd-
I ment as not made "under and in ac
| cordance with" the Enabling Act, it
j has been validated by the judicial de
i cree in the special proceeding "for the
I determination of validity and legal

j cilect of grants or otlu r instruments,
j creating, changing or affecting trusts,
I etc., of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
: versity."
