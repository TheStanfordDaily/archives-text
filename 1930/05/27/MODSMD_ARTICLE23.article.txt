The new Stanford of ilit- twentieth century is going to see vast
changes in the nature, object, and personnel (if the I'niversity.
Not least among these potential forms of iho new Stanford is j
the real possibility of more women.
Historians of the future will look' hack upon the early days of i
ihe Stanfords' I'alo Alto I'arm and curiously contemplate the j
unique S'X) limit. The day will come —at least the possibility for
ihe day to come is a fact —when the femininity of the 1950's will
wonder just how a six to one ratio worked out. The double standard
and the lopsided co-education — the discrimination against the Five i
Hundred which results from sheer numerical weakness —will be in-'
it-resting historical facts of the first days of the I niversity.
The legal status of the l ive I lundred has been carefully brought
to light for the Daily by former judge (leorgc E. Crothers of San
Francisco. As one of the first four men to graduate from the Stan
ford Law School, as the first Stanford graduate on the Hoard of
Trustees, as Mrs. Stanford's personal adviser on legal matters, and
as the writer of much legislation, many amendments, grants, and
other documents concerning the I "niversity, Mr. t'rothers is the one !
best fitted to speak on the real possibilities of Stanford's opening;
her doors to more women.
"Neither the Leland Stanford Junior I niversity, as such, nor
the Hoard of Trustees, as such, is a legal entity," says Mr. t'rothers,
"hut they are dependent upon the trusts and titles vesting in indi
vidual trustees with respect to various gifts which have been in the j
main consolidated into the major trust as created and amended by
ihe Stanfords. The terms of those trusts must be carried out in
good faith, but other trusts not inconsistent with them may he cre
ated in the same trustees."
Thus the possibility of another feminine endowment to the
Hoard of Trustees is a real one.
hollowing is one of the amendments to the trusts dated ()ctober i
3, 1902:
"Inasmuch as it was the paramount purpose of the founders of
the Leland Stanford Junior I'niversity to promote the public wel-!
fare by founding, endowing and having maintained a University
with the colleges, schools, seminaries of learning, mechanical insti
tutes, museums, galleries of art. and all other things necssary and 1
appropriate to a I niversity of high degree, all other directions or
reservations in the Founding (irant and all amendments or at
tempted amendments thereof by the Founders, or by the Survivor ,
of them, shall he deemed incidental and subordinate to that para- ,
mount purpose."
The I'niversitv was founded by Leland Stanford and his wife j
"for both sexes." Number 10 of Section. 4 of the hounding (Irani
reads: "To afford equal facilities and give equal advantages in the
I 'niversity to both the sexes." As this is incorporated into the state i
law of California, the subsequent amendment limiting the number j
of women to 500 does not alter the real meaning of the Founding ,
< irant. The Stanford trusts, as such, cannot he used to educate
more women than the Five I lundred of Mrs. Stanford's amendment
of 1800.
The expression "equal advantages and facilities" may not imply
identical advantages and facilities. According to Crothers, the ex
pression "is probablv open to such a construction as would make the
expression read in substance 'to afford equal facilities and give
equal advantages in the I niversity to both sexes considering their
respective requirements in view of the different physical structure
and the requirements for the anticipated callings and future condi
tions and duties of life of the majority in each group.' "
The D.\ii.iks of last week have seen a merry skirmish of wit be
tween the men and the women of the I'niversity. Each side has
criticized in a good-natured spirit- the other, but the ranks are so
unequal that the Five Hundred deserves great credit for putting up
a gallant light. I'erhaps the little struggles between the Farm's
co-eds and her men in the decades of the future will not he so
uneven.
Stanford women want ten million dollars. I hey want "equal
facilities and equal advantages." And of course they want a new
gym let it again be said. They want the right tit find their own
places in the new world of the twentieth century, and they want
to find this right in the new Stanford of the twentieth century —
in the new education for men and women which was so well ex
pressed by Leland Stanford when he said that masculine and femi
nine training should be "varied only as nature dictates."
Let the hive Hundreds of the past Stanford years think of the
first days of the I niversity as the oak which is inherent in the
acorn. Let the spirit of equality and democracy which is the spirit
of the West itself he ennobled in the new Stanford and let Stanford
rise out of the pettv discrimination against one half of the human
race.
When the first Spaniards sought shelter beneath the Palo Alto
tree, it was to plant a small wooden cross where a mission was to
be erected in the new world. It remained for a great railroad pioneer
to choose the towering redwood as a mission site—and a mission of
learning and enlightenment.
Let it be a mission of enlightenment delivered by the hand<\of
justice on all the sons and daughters of men -and the Stanford
Red.
