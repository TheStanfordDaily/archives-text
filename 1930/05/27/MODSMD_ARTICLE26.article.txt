JAN THE ROMANTIC. Anony- i
mous.. Harper & Brothers. New
York. 1929.
"Jan t lie Romantic," written
anonymously with a leisurely char
acter touch that speaks of Charles
Dickens, tells the story of a boy
dreamer with it quiet, simplicity of
style that is in itself recognition of 1
the essential and lasting romanti
j cisni of human emotion and t ola
lions.
The hook is subtitled "A Story of
France" and ii might indeed bo a
French travel story backed against
liberal patches <• I' French history.
! II might he but it is not; every
' thing is handled from the side of '
, human contact, everything reduces
to the personality. That is the es
! scnce of romanticism.
Jan is a dreamer, a poet, and
j finally finds himself wandering the
J high-roads of France, a contented
i nomad. Surely t here is chance here
1 for variety of characters, change j
of scene, unusual viewpoint.
In a style as simple, contented •
as the wanderings of which he
[writes, the author produces every;
color; the <|tiais of Havre, the ,
i sounds and sights of the cirque
| Rassuli, ruins of old churches and
(castles, tlie grimmer but no less
human war-crushed France. All
these stand against characters
kaleidoscope, finely and strongly
i drawn, a combination that gives a
| rich blending of the old world with
1 the new.
Jan appears with his worldly pos
sessions on his back, miserable;
Jan leaves in his van with Ihe road
ahead, happy.

THE AMAZON. By Elliott Paul.
New York: Horace Liveright.
1930.
Lieutenant Alberta Snyder, wo
men's Signal Corps Battalion, de
termined to take her division of
telephone operators to the front. j
And finally by consistently sign
ing herself A. Snyder and avoiding
interviews, she was ordered to a
French village rather close to the
i line by the chiefs at Washington,
who little thought that the Lieuten
ant was other than a he-man. Here
ensued a period of inactivity—giv
ing plenty of opportunity for the
love interest to enter between the
Amazons and the men already
quartered in the town.
One day the Major, who blushes
and stammers in the presence of
' women, arrives and is properly
shocked at these matter-of-fact wo
men in khaki skirts. There is great
I need for telephone operators and
these women are the only ones to
be had so in spite of the Major's
disgust at having to rely on women
i they are sent ahead to the front.
On account of their skill at the
. switchboard and with the French
language these girls render con
siderable service.
It is just before the Armistice
when two German school boys dis
cover that they are being fought
| with women. Terrific attacks fol
i low. One of the American men lets
it.he known that he thinks the con
l <6ntrated offensive is due to the

presence of the women. Feeling ;
Unit although she has attempted to '
overcome the handicaps of her sex
she has become a deterrent to the
cause to which she has bound her
self, Alberta gives herself over to j
the enemy anil her Sergeant, Flor
ence Mason, commits suicide.
All the related facts of the story 1
are only joined three years after j
the war through the painstaking !
efforts of a newspaper reporter. It 1
is an excellent piece of research |
work, particularly interesting for i
the latter part where the German j
point <ii' view enters when Alberta j
is recuperating in the family of the i
German flier. All this is very in- I
genious but the book is not well I
enough writ ten to make more than |
n passing impression.

SEDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM. By !
Emily Hahn. Brewer & War- j
ren, Inc. Payson & Clarke, Ltd. j
New York. 1930.
Seductio ad Absurdum, by Emily 1
Tlahn, is subtitled The Principles,
and Practices of Seduction. It is
exactly that. It purports to be a |
beginner's handbook of the applied
an of seduction. It is in reality a
collection of cleverly ludicrous de
scriptions of methods to be used in
Iliis art. The first few incidents will"
amuse you, but after that, I hey pall.
After a while, you begin to doubt,
with the Missouri judge, that there
is such a thing as seduction. The
results of each method are the
same, and the process seems so
simple and so co-operative.
The most entertaining parts of
this book are the introduction
(with carefully erudite footnotes),
the settings for each incident (for
mally headed by Type of Man,
Psychology and Background of Sub
ject, Necessary Apparatus, and j
Helpful Remarks), and the biblio
graphy. The bibliography contains
titles ranging from Mother Goose
to Three Weeks. Perhaps the best
is An Elementary Treatise on
Curve Tracing.
Such remarks as characterizing
a subject as "Very young, semi
sophisticated. That is, she has been
warned but not insulated," liven
the rest of the book and make it
good entertainment for a light
hearted hour. —W. S.
THE ARIZONA KID. At the
Varsity Theater.
And still another wild west pic- .
ture! Hut as long as guns and horses j
continue to have their appeal, pictures
like the "Arizona Kid" will be a suc
cess, especially with the added at
, traction of Warner Baxter as the bad I
man, and a plot, though slightly mu
tilated, t'rom O. Henry.
I he movies have turned the "Cisco
j Kid" into a typically red-blooded
i thriller. There are gun lights, dead
; men, galloping steeds, and dusky-eyed
beauties. The picture moves swiftly,
creating the usual suspense, and more
besides : this Warner Baxter can ride
a horse and sing too.
Mona Maris makes a very charming
heroine. Iler acting is excellent, and
being Spanish her accent is one of i
the few convincing ones in the show.
