BASEL, France, May 2f>. (>P)- -
Probably the only truly internation
al links in the world are those of
the golf club at Basel, France.
The club is Swiss, but it is lo
cated in France. And the most curi
ous feature is that it is a little
customs-free spot, surrounded by
customs guards who allow the club
members to come and go without
examination. Instead of passports,
the members merely show their
( iub cards. Some are so well known
their faces are their passports.
The club was formed in 1926.
The American Consul, Calvin M.
Hitch, was the only American. Now
there are several of his countrymen
among the 175.
