When "Dink" Templeton's
band of red-shirted athletes
commence their task of taking
Southern California's Trojans
down the line some 3,000 miles
from home grounds this Friday
and Saturday, Cardinal sup
porters will wait with abated
breath to learn just how the
Stanford spikesters fare upon
the cinderpath.
For once Stanford, the home of
Hie brave and tlie land of shotput
tors, must rest its' hopes of victory
on the legs of ( ardinal sprinters,
hurdlers, and 440 men lather than
on tin- broad shoulders of Tempi"'
ton's mighty weight men.
Not that the points already
awarded to Messrs. Krenz and
Rothert, and their able sup
porting cast of Grey, Fleisch
hacker, Jones, and Tandy in
the shot and discus, nor those
to be collected by broad-jump
ers Uowell, West, and Butler,
and pole vaulter Berry will not
be counted in the final stand
ings. But rather that to these
points must be added . every
count possible to be squeezed
out of the track events if the
Cards are to once again cop
the pennant.
Jus! what depredations change
of temperature, humidity, food, and
water will make in the abilities of
the Card trackmen, Dver, Howell,
Ciberson, Morrison, Shove, llables,
Smith, and Nisfolt cannot he pre
dicted. Ii was Inn?', the theory that
the distance to be travelled to
reach the 1.C.-4A. battleground plus
the decided change in climate
wrought such havoc upon the sta
mina and temperament of runners
that they could not successfully
cope with opponents of lesser abili
ties. Points won in recent years by
Spencer, Nichols, Dyer, and other
Stanford athletes do much to refute
this proposition.
However, it is a matter of
record that Cardinal tracksters
have never turned in track per
formances in the East to com
pare with their Western rec
ords. Such being the case, it is
perhaps fortunate that Southern
California, rather than some
Eastern college, will furnish
TempletoiVs men with their
greatest competition.
For all of the Stanfordit.es have
certain disputes to settle with their
Trojan rivals. The widely-adver
tised Dver-Wykoff lend has little
advantage in point of intensity over
the Giberson, I lowell-Maurer, Guy
er disagreement. Podge Smith
burns with the desire to again
show his heels to Jeddy Welch,
while A 1 Nisbet aims to cut into
the Carls, Favne and Co. low hur
dles monopoly. Tu the quarter mile
Morrison, llables, and Shove don't
care whom they beat as long as
they cross the line ahead of Wil
liams and Wesnner.
And inasmuch as all of these
Southern California speed
burners can run their pet
events in very, very fair time,
should the Cardinal trackmen
fulfill their nefarious desire to
humiliate the Trojans rest as
sured that Stanford will once
again be crowned intercollegi
ate champion.
