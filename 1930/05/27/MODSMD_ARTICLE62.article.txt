# Trojans Favored Over Stanford In IC-4A Meet
## EXPERTS INDICATE VICTORY FOR TROY IN TRACK CLASSIC Westerners Expected To Take All But Three First Places 
### 
N T EW YORK, May 20. (/P) Picked,
athletes of California's three major t
universities were headed toward j
I lie East today for I lie r» 4111 track
and field championships of the in- :
lereollegia te A.A.A.A., to ho held
in Harvard Stadium, Hoston, Kri- j
day and Saturday.
All calculations point to an over- i
whelming triumph for Dean Crom- |
well's powerful Southern California '
squad, a well rounded outfit that i
crushed Dink Teinpleton's Stanford !
Cardinals, anolher formidable ar- j
ray, X 4 1-12 to 40 11-12, in a dual j
meet. Stanford has boon installed j
as the export choice for socon.. ;
place with the East's most optimis- j
tic observers expecting nothing bet- \
ter than third place for any of the |
principal Atlantic seaboard arrays,!
Harvard, Penn, Cornell, or Yale.
11l addition to Stanford and j
Southern California, the East must j
cope with challenges from the Uni
versity of California, .Michigan,
and Michigan State, although these
latter three are not expected to
figure heavily in the race for team i
honors.
Last year the Par West won the
title for the eighth time in nine
years when Stanford ran away
■with team honors while the East •
was winning 10 of the l~> individual |
championships. Stanford, scoring ;
in nine events, piled up a total of j
4f» ::-S with Southern California's!
21 good enough for second.
This time the East is conceded
no more than three in individual
titles, the hammer throw and the
half mile and two-mile runs.
Wykoff Favored
In the century, the Atlantic sea-I
hoard is given hardly a look-in with !
Frank Wykoff, Southern California, j
who recently was timed in !t 4-10 i
seconds without starting blocks; i
Eddie Tolan, University of Michi
gan negro flash who holds the
world's record at 9 5-10; and Hoc
Dyer of Stanford, picked to fight ;
it out for first honors. All three
may run in the 220 as well although
there is a chance that Wvkpff will
confine his activities to the bun-j
died.
Krenz Conceded Discus
Eric Krenz of Stanford is con- j
ceded the discus title for the sec
ond year in a row and iiis team-;
mate, Harlow Rothert, should win
the shot put.
Other western stars include Rill
Carls and Jed Welch of Southern
California, and A 1 Pogolotti of Cali
fornia in the hurdles; Johnny Mor-!
i rison of Stanford in the quarter; j
Ken Churchill and Emory Curtice
of California and Jess Mortenson
of P.S.C. in the javelin; Richard j
Barber and Howard Paul of South- i
ern California and Virgil Dowel!
and Arnold West of Stanford in
the broad jump; William Hubbard
of Southern California in the pole i
vault, and Rob Van Osdel of South
ern California in the high jump.
Frank Conner of Yale is the ace
of the hammer throwers; Russell
Chapman of Bates looks like the
best of the half-milers; and Paul
Rekers, of Penn State, will bo fa
vored in the two-mile.
In the mile the East will have
formidable representation in the
persons of Bill AlcKniff of Penn; !
Joe Hickey of New York I'nivor-:
sity, defending champion, Oeorge ,
Bullwinklo of City College of New ;
York, but Southern California of
fers a star in Cliff Halstead.

who recently was timed in !t 4-10 i
seconds without starting blocks; i
Eddie Tolan, University of Michi
gan negro flash who holds the
world's record at 9 5-10; and Hoc
Dyer of Stanford, picked to fight ;
it out for first honors. All three
may run in the 220 as well although
there is a chance that Wvkpff will
confine his activities to the bun-j
died.
Krenz Conceded Discus
Eric Krenz of Stanford is con- j
ceded the discus title for the sec
ond year in a row and iiis team-;
mate, Harlow Rothert, should win
the shot put.
Other western stars include Rill
Carls and Jed Welch of Southern
California, and A 1 Pogolotti of Cali
fornia in the hurdles; Johnny Mor-!
i rison of Stanford in the quarter; j
Ken Churchill and Emory Curtice
of California and Jess Mortenson
of P.S.C. in the javelin; Richard j
Barber and Howard Paul of South- i
ern California and Virgil Dowel!
and Arnold West of Stanford in
the broad jump; William Hubbard
of Southern California in the pole i
vault, and Rob Van Osdel of South
ern California in the high jump.
Frank Conner of Yale is the ace
of the hammer throwers; Russell
Chapman of Bates looks like the
best of the half-milers; and Paul
Rekers, of Penn State, will bo fa
vored in the two-mile.
In the mile the East will have
formidable representation in the
persons of Bill AlcKniff of Penn; !
Joe Hickey of New York I'nivor-:
sity, defending champion, Oeorge ,
Bullwinklo of City College of New ;
York, but Southern California of
fers a star in Cliff Halstead.
N T EW YORK, May 20. (/P) Picked,
athletes of California's three major t
universities were headed toward j
I lie East today for I lie r» 4111 track
and field championships of the in- :
lereollegia te A.A.A.A., to ho held
in Harvard Stadium, Hoston, Kri- j
day and Saturday.
All calculations point to an over- i
whelming triumph for Dean Crom- |
well's powerful Southern California '
squad, a well rounded outfit that i
crushed Dink Teinpleton's Stanford !
Cardinals, anolher formidable ar- j
ray, X 4 1-12 to 40 11-12, in a dual j
meet. Stanford has boon installed j
as the export choice for socon.. ;
place with the East's most optimis- j
tic observers expecting nothing bet- \
ter than third place for any of the |
principal Atlantic seaboard arrays,!
Harvard, Penn, Cornell, or Yale.
11l addition to Stanford and j
Southern California, the East must j
cope with challenges from the Uni
versity of California, .Michigan,
and Michigan State, although these
latter three are not expected to
figure heavily in the race for team i
honors.
Last year the Par West won the
title for the eighth time in nine
years when Stanford ran away
■with team honors while the East •
was winning 10 of the l~> individual |
championships. Stanford, scoring ;
in nine events, piled up a total of j
4f» ::-S with Southern California's!
21 good enough for second.
This time the East is conceded
no more than three in individual
titles, the hammer throw and the
half mile and two-mile runs.
