# IMMENSE NUMBER OF QUESTIONNAIRES SENT IN TO OFFICE
## 
### 
With each distribution of campus
mail the enterprising inhabitants
of the Daily business office find
themselves buried beneath ever-in
creasing piles of figures, mimeo
graphed sheets, and statistics. The
questionnaires mailed to twenty
per cent of the Stanford students
to gather information on their ex
penses are coming in in swarms.
From their hiding places beneath
a mountain of drawing boards, slide
rules, graph papers, adding ma
chines, and hundreds of printed
sheets the workers look with har
rassed eyes on all intruders. Al
most mechanically they bend their
eyes on the pages and pages of
figures before them. They are ar
ranging, tallying, compiling, and
averaging the replies given by stu
dents personally and by mail to
their questions. Publications Coun
cil is gratified by the results of
I the inquiry. Over seventy per cent
lof the quesitonnaires sent to the
campus men have been answered,
which, according to Ed Fields, is a
phenomenal return.
