## Class Gift Will Be Added To General Alumni Endowment Contribution Pledges Will Be Flexible 
### 
Definite plans were made ycstcr
! day afternoon at a meeting of the
Senior Endowment Committee for the
I collection of the funds which the
• lass of 1930 will present to the Uui
-1 versity. Robert Clarke, chairman of
llie committee, assigned each member
i of his committee a number of seniors
from whom to collect pledges. The
| committee includes Frances Shoup,
Flizabeth Sealtergood, Miriam Miller,
Boyd McNaughton, Otis Williams,
I Helen Thompson, Alfred l.eonhardt,
Wayne I lackey, Herbert Mayer, and
Albert Doeer.
112 unds pledged by this class will go
1 to swell those of the general alumni
endowment fund, since the class has
agreed that this plan will insure a
wiser distribution of funds than for
merly, through the permanency of the
administration, and is considered bet
ter than a provision for any specific
use. This general fund is placed at
: the discretion of the class president, to
be used in the case of any emergency.
Flexible Pledges
Since the .seniors have paid only
i about one-third of the actual tuition
expenses, the committee feels that
! each student will be glad to pledge
a certain amount of money to be paid
yearly following graduation. These
pledges are extremely flexible, since
the senior may increase or decrease
his contribution at any time, and will
not be obliged to start payment im
mediately after commencement. If he
is unable to meet his pledge during
one year, he will not be requested to
double the amount the following'year.
A former endowment system involv
ing a yearly insurance policy premium
payable to the University proved too
complex, and the actual income out
of proportion to the effort. Classes in
recent years have followed the simpler
plan oi a general endowment, and it is
expected that' the flexibility of this
year's pledge will bring forth an un
usually large subscription.
