going out when his horse hesitates, or
hits a harrier. The sixth contest, the i
polo stake race, consists of making a i

return to the starling line. A polo :
mallet is carried and hilling a stake j
disqualifies the rider.
Musical chairs, jumping in pairs, j
| mounted wrestling, and mounted tug-!

two events are contested by teams of 1
j five men each. In mounted wrestling,)
the object is to pull opposing men j
