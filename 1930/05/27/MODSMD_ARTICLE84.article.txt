# EERIE WAILS FROM ROOF OF ENGINEERING BUILDING RESULT OF LOUDSPEAKER TEST
## 
### 
Rising up the complete scale and ,
lasting an accurate seven seconds,
a siren-like noise from a loud- j
speaker on top of the roof of the j
electrical engineering laboratories
broadcasted to a microphone four ;
feet in front of it is a necessary
evil of an experiment being con
dueled to test loudspeakers by ('.
ill. Skinner, working for his mas
ter's degree in electrical engineer
ing.
The noise, or squeal as it is more
j c orrectly termed, is produced by I
j an oscillator and is converted to
sound on the roof-top in order to
avoid interference of reflected or
] "standing" waves which would
j arise nearer the ground or in an
enclosed space.
In the laboratory below, Skinner,
i by means of an oscillograph, takes
| pictures of just what happens in
j n loudspeaker when it is treated
: with a certain amount of electric
current at all of the wave-lengths |
to which it might be subjected. .
All of the apparatus has taken
more than a year to build and as
semble. One of the electric motors
which is necessary to regulate the
i amount of input power is one-thou
sandth of a horsepower—just
strong enough to turn the appara
tus and yet weaTl enough to stop
immediately the power is turned

off.
The complete arrangement, is a
quick and more accurate method
of testing radio loudspeakers, giv- j
ing a picture record of continuous j
performance. The picture also eon- i
tains a graph of other factors which
might change and thus makes a
permanent record.
According to Skinner, although
tiie idea of measuring radio appara
tus is not new, the instruments
which lie has set up make possible
a more accurate calibration, and
are a possible aid to future radio
development.
