# POKER PLAYER ROW WHEN DECK SHOWS ONE ACE TOO MANY
## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 2(5. (jp)â€”The hol
lering and .-"iling in Joseph Gor
man's room at 3215 Maypole ave
nue yesterday was because one gen
tleman in a gentleman's poker
game held tour jacks and an ace,
and another gentleman held four
aces and a jack. This can be done
in pinochle, but the gentlemen
were not playing pinochle.
Fisticuffs followed, and it is not
surprising. Nothing makes a gen
tleman holding four jacks and an
ace angrier than to see another
gentleman holding four aces and
a jack. There was much biff-bang
ing. Peaceful pedestrians paused
outside, for many people enjoy a
good fight, or even just a plain or
dinary fight.
Some policemen came along and
nine poker players went lo jail.
No one explained about the five
jacks and the five aces, it was the
general opinion, however, that the
playing card company must have
made a mistake in that particular
deck.
