DENVEU, May 26— (A 3 )— A revolt
against the conventions and routine of
j every May life was in progress here to
| day with 11 women, nine of them
t married, in seclusion in the country
j home of Mrs. Henry Swan.
j The eleven women departed from
1 Denver today leaving children and
husbands behind and torbidding com
munication of any kind with the Swan
home. Husbands repaired to clubs
and went into custody of
nurses as wives and mothers left the
city.
The women jointly expressed a de
termination to "get away from it all"
tor a rest from the whole business of
routine living. They were a little
tired, tiies said, of bridge games inter
rupted by a clock which proclaimed it
time to go home and prepare for din
ner. They also were a little weary
ol luncheons and parties.
I bey claim they have performed
their wifely and domestic duties faith
j fully and well and that they', like their
I men tolk whom they are forsaking for
a week, are in need of a vacation.
