### 
"Do co-eds smoke? If so, do liii-v
indulge in the weed openly or do
they bootleg their nicotine?"
This was the substance of a dis
cussion by several of the 30-odd
Pacific ('oast student body )»r« si
dents at their annual conference
hold last week at the University of
Washington. The results of tli" un
official discussion were printed in
the "University of Washington
Daily" and took up the statements
of various of the student leaders.
"The question is no longer
whether women smoke or whether
they should smoke, but what brand
they smoke and how much," said
John Reynolds, student body presi
dent ef the Univ< rsity of California.
Speaking for his college, Rey
nolds is quoted as saying that
"Berkeley co-eds use all brands of
cigarettes and smoke in their soror
ity houses, in buildings and offices
on the campus, but do not smoke
011 t he streets or campus paths dur
ing the day."
l(c,vuolds was also credited with

i the statement that Stanford co-eds
puff nonchalantly on street and
campus, day or night. According
to the "Daily," Reynolds said that
there was no rule or tradition
against smoking on the campus, at
dances, or elsewhere, either at Cali
fornia or Stanford.
Stanford Steinhi el< yesterday de

Use of the fragrant* fag is barred
by ruling of the I'.H.C. Administra
tion, and by tradition, men may
not smoke on the campus either,
i Rut both men and women are per
j milled to light tip at the student
union building, according to Deo
Adams and Louis dough, outgoing
and incoming Trojan student heads.
"Smoking is banned at university
social functions," the men are re
ported to have said, "but the fair
sex is allowed a pack or so a day
in special smoking rooms in the
sorority houses."
Rob Allen, student body presi
dent at the University of Arizona, j
stated that "there is an administra- ,
tion ruling against women smoking 1
on llie Arizona campus, but co-eds
bootleg a few puffs now and then." j
