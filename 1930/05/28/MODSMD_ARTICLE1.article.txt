# WESTERN TRACK TEAMS ARRIVE AT CAMBRIDGE
## Card Squad Goes Through Light Workout; Rothert Puts Shot Over 51 Feet Cromwell Confident Troy Will Win Meet; Christie Predicts U.S.C. Triumph 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 27. (/I 3 )
The cream of tlx; Far West's
mighty track and field forces today
worked out in the Harvard Stadium
to get in trim for the 54th 1.0.4-A.
championships here on Friday and
Saturday.
Thirty-four colleges will send
teams to contest for Ihe intercolle
giate title. However, the meet ap
peared doomed to be nothing more
than a dual contest between two
California!) institutions, Stanford,
which won the title last year, and
Southern California, unless the ath
letes of Harvard and Pennsylvania,
the two strongest teams in the
East, perform in an unexpected
manner.
Cards Limber Up
Robert L. (Dink) Templeton had
18 of his Stanford stalwarts work
ing out late this afternoon. Most
of them took easy jogs about the
track but Harlow Rothert, the Card
inal's great shot-putter, unlimbered
enough to toss the 16-pound ball
better than 51 feet.
The delegation of 20 Trojans
from Southern California took mat
ters easy under the direction of
Coach Dean Cromwell, who ap
peared so confident of victory lie
announced his plans to run Frank
Wykoff only in the 100-yard dash.
Cromwell figured that his well
balanced outfit, which has already
taken the measure of Stanford,
would pile up enough points to
spare his great sprinter from doing
double duty in the "220" event.
Though Coach Walter Christie
brought but seven of his Univer
sity of California squad East, he
l.as high hopes that his handful will
finish third, behind the other two
California!) delegations. Christie
predicted Southern California would
edge Stanford out of the champion
ship by a scant margin.
Templeton, however, predicted
that his Cardinals would lead the
field again if some of the Eastern
stars were able to take points away
from the Trojans in the low hurdle
and high jump events.
