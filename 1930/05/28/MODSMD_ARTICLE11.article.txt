# YOST SAYS 500 SHOULD BE GREATER
## Artificial Group Created By Present Limiting Of Women 
### 
"The 500 limit creates u distinct
i ly artificial group," said Dean Mary
I Yost yesterday afternoon in an in-
I t.erview for the Daily.
"The size of the women's group
j makes it unnecessarily conspicu
ous in the campus life," continued
j Miss Yost. "The normal social
! group lias much greater equality
'of numbers than the division of
! men and women here at Stanford.
"A greater parity in numbers
(would tend toward establishing an
(attitude through which the women
would he regarded even more than
I now as an organic part of the com
in unity life rather than as an addi
tional unit. The women would i>e
taken for granted if there; was nu-
I merical equality.
"In the advent of more women,
i there would be a greater chance of
equality in extra-curricular activi
ties," declared Dean Yost. "The
larger number of men is the reason
j for the assumption that the most
important offices should be held by
men. With more women there would
j be a greater chance for the candi
date best titled to get the position.
I There is no reason why a woman
| should not be president of the
|A.S.S.t T . or editor of the Daily.
"Personally, I would feel justified
■in opening Stanford's doors to more
I women because the Five Hundreds
j of the past have taken advantage
|of the educational facilities t«» an
equal, if not. greater, extent than
the men. The real purpose of Slan
j ford would be furthered by the ad
! mission of additional women st u
! dents."
