## Salt Raids Overshadowed By Civil Disobedience Campaign Riots Rangoon Beleagured By Police And Soldiers 
### 
(BOMBAY, India, May 27. (/P)â€”
i Km>i and tumult, or their aftermath,
I ( Itaos and uncertainty, reigned to
| day in lour great cities of Britain's
| Indian possessions.
A rough computation of official
, figures showed that in Rangoon,
jiiUcknow, Dacca, and Bombay, X 2
{persons had been killed, 8t!" in
| jured, and hundreds arrested.
Over the week-end the riots have
;broken out of the bounds of the
I civil disobedience campaign. They
I overshadowed the salt raids of
; Ma ha Ima Gandhi's volunteers and
I made of "non-violence" a merely
academic term.
i Rangoon, the Burmese capital,
not yet recovered from the heavy
'earthquake of several weeks ago,
I tonight was a beleaguered city. Sol
diers and police were striving des
perately to maintain a hold, already
precarious, over fighting coolies
; and lawless bands.
Fifty-four bodies lay in the city
j mortuary, and many others are be
| lieved to have been carried away
| by friends or kinsmen. The official
j death list stands at GO and the in
l jured list at 740, but these figures
' are considered much below the un
| obtainable totals.
No less serious were conditions
; in famous Lucknow, the great Brit
ish, stronghold of the Indian mutiny
of 1857-ftS, A roll of four dead and
jthirty injured there represents a
j casualty list that seems likely" to
Ibe considerably increased on the
| receipt of further news.
! More serious trouble is feared at
j any moment. Bands of rioters
I paraded through all quarters of the
city after having been dispersed in
| a hot skirmish with police and sol
| diers at Aminbad Park, in the bus
hiest center of th-e city.
The police fired 57 shots at close
; range into a mob attacking one of
their outposts. Fourteen policemen
were taken to hospitals.
