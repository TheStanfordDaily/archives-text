# HOOVER BEHIND LAW MEASURES
## Justice Department Given Prohibition Control 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27. (/p) -|
| President Hoover affixed his signa- '
: tare to measures designed to 1m-
I prove law enforcement today and
I thereby signalled to the Justice
! Department for an intensive effort
1 to enforce the prohibition laws.
One of the measures gave to that I
j department the full responsibility,
j after July 1, for detecting and deal
i ing with violators of the dry laws,
i The others provide for an expan
sion of the prison system.
Immediately after the Chief
j Executive signed the measures, it
I became known from Attorney Gen
jeral Mitchell that district attorneys
t have been summoned to Washing
| ton to discuss improving the co
! ordinated work of detection and
I prosecution. Mitchell also said spe*
! rial agents had visited prosecutors
J throughout the country to urge in-
I tensive prosecution of prohibition
j violators.
Consent Necessary
Under the transfer bill only the
I industrial alcohol division will re-
I main under the Treasury, and it
| must have the consent of the At
' torney General in issuing permits.
The enforcement division will be
headed by a director not yet so-
I lected and Prohibition Commission
[er Doran is expected to remain at
| the Treasury to direct the indus
trial alcohol division.
j The change will transfer about
2,000 employees of the Treasury to
j tlie Justice Department and is ex
j pec ted to bring about a reduction
in the number of prohibition ad
; lninistrative districts as well as a
11(organization of administrative
j forces.
