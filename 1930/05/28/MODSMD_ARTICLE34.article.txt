# THE 						DAILY GOES RED
## 
### 
Red will he the predominant color around the Daily office next
autumn.
Such was the decision made yesterday at the staff election, when
(iale Douglas Wallace, sorrel-topped news hound, was chosen to
edit \ olume 78 of this newspaper.
I he color scheme, let ii he known, refers to the hue of Mr.
Wallace's cranial covering and not to the complexion of his political
affiliations. h.ven if a lot of people, have attributed I bolshevistic
tendencies to the present regime, it should he distinctlv understood
that Mr. Wallace has not been seriouslv tainted bv his associations
at least he is not a Russian.
In other words, people will see Red when they drop into the
journalistic hovel next fall to haggle with the editor. It is a bright
and cheery outlook.
(iale Wallace's career in journalism has been a "colorful one
(that is not a pun). As a stripling freshman he began his work on
the Daily as a lowly reporter, going up through the various ranks
until he has finally succeeded in reaching this "pinnacle" of success.
In addition to amateur activities on the student newspaper, Wallace
has been sports editor of the I'alo Alto Times, campus correspond
ent for the I nited I'ress, and local representative of the Berkeley
(iHSCIIC.
I'he experience he has gained from these activities and the native
journalistic ability which is his. make him unusually fitted for an
editorial career. Wallace is a practical and experienced newspaper
man such as i> seldom found in college journalistic circles.
The editor of Volume 77 growing more senile every day—
congratulates Wallace as a friend and as a newspaper man. Vol
ume 78 and its editor are destined to success.
Wallace was successful in competition with Leonard I'artlett.
It was the case of two good men seeking an office which could be
filled by only one. Kven though defeated, I'artlett, too, is in line
tor congratulation. The part he has played in the drama of campus
lournalism at Stanford has been a large one. Verily, today's aging
editor was a lucky man to have such understudies.
I hit this is enough. Tenaciously, the present patriarch clings to
what is his. \ () Red I'e'ril can oust him from his place until he is
leally gone.
The old man has three more days to live, for those three days
!:<• will continue to plant hi> ample frame in the editorial chair and
keep his feet (equallv ample) beneath the editorial typewriter. The
Red, after all. is only crown prince.
Sobs are forming in the old man's throat ; his ancient (and
ample) frame is beginning to quiver. I>ut he braces himself, lie.
steels worn nerves.
In three days a swan song. Xot until then.
