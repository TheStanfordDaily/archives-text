Reforms .and revisions are very popular this spring.
In the perilous depths of lockout discussion there came to light
a pernicious evil which has long been wreaking havoc on the femi
r.'ne contingent's health and scholarship.
This is the unequal distribution of major offices among the
women.
With a feeling akin to communism last Friday's Conference
went 12 to 1 in favor of the equal distribution of political activities
Mnong the most capable of the I'ivc I lundred.
lie,ginning with the Class of 1933 no woman will be allowed to
hold more than one of the following oilices: member of A.W.S.
Council, position on Fxecutive Committee, president of \\ .A.A..
president of Y.W.C.A.. women's editor of Daily and Quad, A.S.
S.l\ concert manager, manager of Daily and Quad.
This is indeed another limitation of the hive Hundred.
While the Daily today has a slightly red hue—and is just
socialistic enough to believe in the equal distribution of the campus
most important oilices, it does seem as if revision should hold no
rules up as an ideal—and not go in for promulgating more restric
tions on a group already heavily burdened with rules, regulations,
restrictions, admonitions, exhortations, pleas, precepts, and prin
ciples.
Let's get back to the simple life of the Farm.
