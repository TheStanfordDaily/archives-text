PULITZER AWARDS FOR 1929. 1
The Pulitzer awards in letters, I
established in I!H7, each year ere
' site interest in literary circles. The
awards litis year, especially, have
instigated quite a hit of comment,
land speculation on the part of
critics and the reading public.
The prizes of interest in I his re- j
' sped are the ones given to fiction,
drama, biography, and poetry. So
far many critics have severely
scored the committee on their
choices. Especially is lliis true in
respect to the poetry and drama
choices.
This year's fiction prize was
given to "Laughing Hoy" by Oliver
La Farge as the book that "best
represented the whole atmosphere
I ol' American life." The book is pub
lished by Houghton Mifflin Com
pany. At. the time the book was
published it gained quite a bit of
! popularity and received favorable
I comment from critics.
I "Laughing Hoy" concerns itself
with a slightly covered field in mod
ern literature- that of the present
day American Indian. It is a story
of the conflict between tlie Indians
and the whites, this time not a
, question of rights to land hut of i
social customs. Laughing Hoy, the |
! typical Indian youth, marries Slim
Girl, who has been emancipated,
as it were, by the, white mission
aries. This conflict enters into their
lives and tragedy follows.
"Laughing Boy" is certaintly
thoroughly American. La Farge,
and this is his first hook, writes
with an easy style and his per
j trayal of character is especially
poignant. You will enjoy it im
mensely if you have not already
read it.
Marc Connelly's "Green Pas
tures" was the drama, choice of the
year. Adverse criticism immediate
ly followed on two scores: first,
that it was not an original award
j as the specifications call for, since
it was adapted from Roark Hrad
-1 ford's "01' Man Adam an' His Chil
jlun"; and second, thai it was pub
lished in J9IJO rather than l!)2fl. The
latter objection is trivial; the play
was produced in 192!t, making it
for all practical purposes a play of
that year. There is more substance
| to the other criticism, the question
being "what is originality?" But to ;
my mind the objection is unjusti- |
I tied —"Green Pastures" is a bril
-1 liant and vital drama. Bradford's
I book may have furnished the germ
idea, but Mart; Connelly adds an in
i terpretation all his own. The play
j is a Biblical drama of negro tem-1
' perament.
The biography choice, Marquis j
James' "The Raven," was entirely ,
unexpected. Bookstores report that
the sale was small previous to the
announcement. But the book has
jits merits. It. is the only popular
i biography of that thoroughly Amer- !
lican character, Sam Houston. lis
'author was formerly a writer of
[dime novels. He uses the experi
ence he gained there to good ad-j

1 vantage in this book. He lias mas
tered the art ot' keeping his story
! going.
The poetry award was given to
an anthology rather than to an
original work. Conrud Aiken's "Se
lected Poems" is the book. This de
cision is without precedent in the
Pulitzer awards, and probably was
ja result, of a doubt in the minds
ol' the judges that an original work,
worthy of the prize, had been pro
duced last year. —R. L.
VILE BODI E3—By Evelyn Waugh.
Jonathan Cape, Harrison Smith.
New York. 1930.
Vile Bodies, by Evelyn Waugh, is
the cleverest book of the year. It ist
a satire on modern social ten
dencies as they will be if they con
! linue to develop on the same lines
for the next ten years. The modern
attitude toward sex and morality,
as evinced by the allegedly "real
istic" novelists of the younger
generation, comes in for an amus
ing drubbing. The satire is never
heavy. It seems to aim at entertain
ment rather than reform.
"Vile Bodies" is the story of a
carefree, rather stupid, young
writer and his hard-boiled, likeable
'fiancee. Neither is a person, hut
I just a character. However, it is
scarcely necessary for the charac
ters of a satire to be real. Into their
mouths are put some choice lines.
On one occasion, they go off to a
country inn for the night, he plan
ning to he married in t he morning,
she having secret knowledge of a
financial disaster which will make
their marriage impossible. As they
reach the hotel and he asks for 1
dinner and a room for the night,
she demands:
"Oh, darling, am I going to he
seduced?"
"I'm afraid so. Do you mind aw
fully?"
"Oh, not so much as all that,"
she added in cockney. "Charmed,
I'm sure."
Such is the conversation of our
young people, if you believe the :
"modernists," implies Mr. Waugh.
Obviously, he doesn't.
"Vile Bodies" is laid in the Eng
land of the future, just exactly how 1
future is not clear. One of the most
amusing characters in the book is i
Mrs. Ape, who is a more violent !
! type of Aimee Semple MacPherson. j
! Touring with her is a troupe of j
| female angels. Chastity, the most
important, is allowed to reappear
at various stages of the story until
we have her complete history from
the time she leaves Mrs. Ape's
j domineering influence for life as a
I cabaret girl in South America to
| her return to Europe as an "enter- 1
| tainer" of the officers in a post
j historical war. She, like the less
divine members of the cast, takes ,
things lightly.
If you don't chuckle through the
; full two hours required to read
"Vile Bodies," there is something
wrong with you. As we said before,
■ it is the cleverest book of the year,
