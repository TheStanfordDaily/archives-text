(T.ujtor's Xotk,—l'olfowiiuj is llii' fourth of a series written by a Hit si- i
ness student to assist seniors in ilioosin;/ a line for ijrailnale study or business
I pursuit. It is n sequel to tlic recent article on /:. A'. Slront/ Jr.'s course, "J'sy- \
j cholofiy of Sellint) and /Idvertisinq.")

Many a promising business has been i
■ made or wrecked by the genius or
stupidity behind its advertising and
selling strategy. Occasionally rich
magnates knowing little about adver
tising have been known to split pen
nies to cut down production costs and
then spend hundreds of thousands for
advertising based on hunches and mc
jdiocre advice.
A college man who has mastered
statistical science, methods of testing
"appeal" in ads, surveying results, and
who has ideas, is inventive, keen, crea
tive, is reasonably sure of a good job.
The application of statistical method
(to such problems is in its infancy,
i Science, which has guided a century i
of engineering, has not yet permeated
the entire field of marketing. Only
two strictly graduate business schools
in America give this work.
Great strides have been made since ;
: 1870 in engineering science, cheap
, production of things only a king
could have had 100 years ago. Today
attention is definitely veering toward j
our distributive system, where the
! worst leaks are now, and w here there
I are few men trained to cope with the,
j problem. It costs more to sell some'
products than to make them! Pro- 1
duction costs are steadily declining,
' but distribution costs are actually l is- ,
ing. More high positions in future
will be filled with men of sales ap- |
I pearance who understand these vital)
j issues that make or break a business.
Overproduction of men is making
I good positions more and more difficult
to get. If of equal ability, the man ,
who can "sell" himself will be most
apt to get the high position.
Hundreds of salesmen of the old
school lumber along trying to .sell a
(product, until some brainy chap ana- t
I lyzes their methods and formulates a
better system. Commissions may then
be cut and salesmen will make even
i more than previously.
| Salesmanship is undergoing radical
| changes. Intelligence will go further,
it is found, than nerve. The "highest
pressure" artist today is the salesman
who uses no pressure at all. Good
salesmen should never be condemned,
: no matter bow many old timers are J

still in the game. Many of our present !
ideals could not have been put across
without salesmen. Some of these ideas !
have permanently enriched the race. |
Life insurance, one of the greatest j
social boons of modern times, required I
millions of hours of brain-work and I
talking to be launched. Ii takes real
effort to put even the best ideas over, j
In Kurope, life insurance is sold!
through banks instead of salesmen, i
and little is sold. In this country few j
self-rtspecting men will be without it. j
J'eople had to be taught to want bath- ,
tubs, unknown prior to IS4O, and tele
phones, which 110 one wanted at first, j
The present belief in cleanliness' is j
to a surprising degree the result of a 1
quarter century of effective advertis
ing by soap companies.
Real ability gains recognition sooner j
in sales and advertising than in some
fields. Bruce Barton, famous lecturer
and author, president of the firm of
Barton, Durstine & Osborn, and
among the foremost advertising ex
perts living, achieved fame in his
thirties. (Began at JO as a Wear-
Ever salesman.) Thirty in 'Their
Thirties tells of M) men who attained
executive positions in their thirties
through experience in selling life in
surance. Few fields allow a man
under 40 to wield so much influence,
exercise so much discretion and an
thority, or be so free to choose his
own methods and introduce his own
ideas.
