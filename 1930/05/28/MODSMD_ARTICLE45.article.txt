Now that every football team
that plays Stanford in the fall 11: ik
been pulled to pieces and thorough- ;
ly discussed, the next thing in
order is to put them all together
and figure out just where the sore
points in the schedule lie.
Starting out with the West
Coast Army on September 20,
just five days after fall prac
tice begins, Stanford will prob
ably not have much to worry
about on that date. Murrel and
Price of West Point will Be
playing for the Ninth Corps
Area, but these two with Gan
uzzi shouldn't be enough to
cause the Redshirts even to
hesitate.
Next comes the Olympic Club on
Ihe twenty-seventh. Ah, a different j
story this time. The Winged "O"
still luis Kaer, McLean, Ford, Kuhn,
and the rest of the old stars, and
flie Post Streeters are now dicker
ing for Frentrup and Sims. The
week after, the Cards play againsi
1 lerm Mettler and all (he rest of ;
the Bucking Broncos. .lust another
long cold afternoon, and maybe the
Santa Clarans will joyously chant
in front of the Stanford rooting sec
tion again.
The Redmen journey to the
wheat belt for the following
Saturday's entertainment to
meet the Minnesota Gophers.
Coach Crisler has a rusky
bunch, but most of the team is
green and shouldn't cause too
much trouble. Oregon State
treks to the Farm on October
18, and should be defeated in
spite of Henry Hughes, Ralph
Buerke, and other notable
Beavers.
Stanford finally sees red on Octo-,
her 25 when the Trojan host and
the L.A. Chamber of Commerce
combine to do battle. Troy lias a
gold mine in the backfield, but the
line is all shot by graduation, and
this may be the deciding factor of
the contest. DulTield, Arbelhide,
Moses, Pinckert, Hall, Mustek, Ap
sit, and Shaver are all back again,
and the U.S.C. Administration!
ought to lie able to dig up a few
more to make the game interesting.
U.C.1,.A. comes next, which does- |
n't mean much at all except it will
be the Cards' first night game, and
1 hen the rejuvenated Phelan
ooached Huskies come down for an
afternoon's work with the farmers I
of Paly Alty. Merle Hufford is ,
Washington's super-threat, and
Sehwegler and Captain Holmes at
the tackles will do a lot oL" damage, j
Even at that, however, the Purple]
and Gold can't he expected to star- '
tie the world with a brand new
mentor—even if the hard-boiled
James did coach his Purdue Boiler
makers to a Big Ten title last year.
Cal Tech is the next thing on
the program, and on Nevember
22, "Pop" Warner meets "Nibs"
Price. This year, however, the
odds should favor Stanford by
a big margin, California having
only a great many ambitious
but inexperienced backfield
heavyweights and linemeji.
Dartmouth is the last attrac
tion on the program, billed for
Npvember 29 in the Stanford
Stadium. Past records ar.e cor
dially against the effete East,
but the Green team may sur
prise.
Taking all in all, the Olympic j
Club, Santa Clara, and U.S.C. look j
to be the hardest games of tlie |
schedule. But, all may be different :
by the time fall rolls around. Selah. J
