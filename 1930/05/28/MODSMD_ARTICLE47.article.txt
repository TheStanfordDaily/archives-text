### 
NEW YORK, May 27. (/P)â€”Aside
from the anticipated battle royal
for the team championship between
Stanford and Southern California,
the Intercollegiate A.A.A.A. track
find field championships at Harvard
Stadium, May 30-31, likely will wit
ness record-breaking performances
in at least four, if not six, ol the
15 events.
Dyer of Stanford and Wykoff,
Southern California, have touched
it 3-f> for the 100-yard dash this
spring several times and if either
duplicate* this time, (tie record of
9 7-10 will be wiped off the books.
Both, however, face a formidable
foe in Eddie Tolan, Michigan's
negro star and the national A.A.I',
champion.
Rothert, Stanford, has heaved
the shot nearly two feet beyond
his own present I.C.A.A.A.A. rec
ord of SO feet 3 inches, made lasf
year. Krenz, also a Stanford husky,
who has beaten the world's record,
hopes to better his own discus rec
ord of 154 feet 11 inches.
Southern California's sophomore
high jumper, Bob Van Osdel, has
cleared 6 feet 7 inches, better than
the existing meet mark and at least
two Western javelin tossers, Mor
tensen of S.C. and Churchill of Cali
fornia, have a chance to eclipse the
record of 205 feet 7% inches.
The 32-year-old record of 23 2-5
seconds for the low hurdles was
bettered 1-10 of a second last year
by Sid Kieselliorst of Yale, two
time defending champion, but the
mark was not allowed due to wind
aid.
It may be beaten this time with
Kieselliorst as well as Smith of
Stanford, Welsh of Southern Cali
fornia. and Pogolotti of California
to force a fast pace.
