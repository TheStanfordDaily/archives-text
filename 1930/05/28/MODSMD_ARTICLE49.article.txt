# THE 						ILLINOIS THUNDERBOLT.
## Lee Sentman of Illinois Looms as Most Consistent of Intercollegiate Hurdlers in Country 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Lee Sentman, of the University
of Illinois, ihe lad who gave Monte
Wells, ex-Dartmouth star and for
mer 1.C.4-A. champion, his first de
feat of the winter in tlie indoor
A.A.U. championships in March, is
.looming up as one of the best and
certainly the most consistent inter
collegiate hurdler in the country.
Coming from the sector that pro
duced Simpson, Brookins, Guthrie,
Werner, Kinsey, Cuhel, and Rock
away, the Illini flash seems a safe
1 bet to win the Western Conference
I high hurdle championship this year,
i Sentman, a pupil of the capable
Harry Gill at the Urbana institu
tion, has followed up a sensational
indoor season with a steady string
of victories on the cinder path, and
may lie the man Uncle Sam is look
ing for to bring back the Olympic
i hurdle championship to these
shores in .1932.
Lee Sentman is a junior hi civil
engineering and, in spite of his in-
I terest in athletics, has managed
i to maintain a B average in his
| studies. He is twenty-one years
i old, 6 feet 1 inch tall, and weighs
1 tJ() pounds. Could weigh a little
more without hurting his hurdling
any, if you ask me. Earl Thomson,
who holds the world's record of
14 2-5 in the 120 high hurdles,
weighed close to two hundred when
at his best. Leo has done twenty
three feet in the broad jump and
6 feet in the high jump too. If Gill
; develops Sentman into a better
I hurdler than his former stars, Kin
( sey and Werner, lie will have quite

I a runner on his team. Yes sir,
1 quite a runner.
Sentman broke the world's in
door records for 70- and 75-yard
hurdles in March and followed this
up with a record-breaking A.A.U.
. title race. He won the high hurdles
at the Drake Relays in 14 9-10, and
at the Ohio Relays a week later m
1 14 4-5 for a new meet record. He
, was second to Dick Rockaway of
Ohio State in the national collegi
ate meet last June, and also placed
fourth in the low hurdles. In the
Western Conference meet two
! weeks earlier he was second in the
; high hurdles and third in the lows.
