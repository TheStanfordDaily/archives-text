# CARD ELEVEN TO MEET MINNESOTA TEAM HERE IN '31
## October 10 Set As Date For Final Encounter Of Two Squads 
### 
Stanford's varsity football squad
will take on the Cniversity of Min
| nesota Gophers in the second game
, of a home and home agreement on
! October 10, 1931, here in the Stan
ford Stadium. News of the accept
| ance of this date was received yes
-1 terday by Graduate Manager A 1
j Masters in a telegram from Herbert
i "Fritz" Crisler, new coach of the
I Minnesota team.
j "Pop" Warner's stalwarts will
! journey to the land of the flour
j mills this fall for a game with the
j Gophers on October 11, sandwiched
; in between games with Santa (Mara
i and Oregon State.
Coach Crisler succeeded "Doc"
i Speers as mentor of football at the
i Midwest college when Speers left
I to take over head coaching duties
j at the University of Oregon. Cris
: ler is reported to he an energetic
| man something on the type of
' Jimmy Phelan, new mentor at
• Washington.
The Minnesota outfit has been
i whipped into shape during the
i spring practice this year, but the
j squad is largely composed of men
| with little experience. Added to
: that, a new coach and new methods
j have put the Gophers on a mediocre
j standing in pre-season prognostica
! tions.
However, the "Thundering Herd,"
I as they call it in the Gopher Prairie
j towns, has had an admirable num
i her of All-American players during
i recent years. Fullback Joesting
I grabbed a post on the mythical all -
j star aggregation in both 192ti and
j 1927. Kenny Haycraft landed a
berth in the ba(*kfield in the next
year's big-time outfit, and last year
Bronko Nagurski and Bob Tanner
were placed on the team.
I This year Minnesota may have
' two aces on the All-America—Jack
I Manders and Pete Sommers.
