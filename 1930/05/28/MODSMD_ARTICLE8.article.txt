! Representing the last of those,
; who came to Stanford as the first
[instructors, Professor James Per
rin Smith will leave tlit* geology
department at the end of this quar
ter. Smith has been a member of
the faculty here since 1892, when |
he came here as an assistant, pro- ,
| fessor, just a year after the found- I
i ing of tlu' University.
A familiar figure about the, Quad,
' Smith has been famous for the. j
| story-telling he does on the goo- 1
| logy corner between classes. For
j years, he has been accustomed to j
I stand there smoking cigarettes and
talking to his various friends among j
the students, with whom he has
! been a great favorite.
Dr. Hranner, founder of the geo
logy department at Stanford, met j
him oil the Arkansas geological j
i survey in the early '!»o's and when j
i organizing his department., asked j
Smith to come as an instructor. Al- I
though Sinit li could not come the j
first year, he taught geology, min- ,
j ing, and paleontology the next. '
Smith had come from North Caro
i linn and had taken his Master's
' degree at l he Vanderbilt University i

I in Tennessee and his I'h.li. in (lol
lingen, Clennuny.
A noteworthy pitcher in his un
dergraduate days. Smith gave it up
i when he began doing intensive re
! .search work for his degrees. When
lie came to Stanford lie took up
| the game again and was a lirst
i class pitcher on the faculty team
which was then an important part
ot the faculty's activities. They
j rarely lost, but when lie left the
jteatn they randy won.
Professor Smith has received na
tional recognition for his work in
| paleontology and has been honored
by both the National and Califor
j nia Academy of Sciences. While lie
has done work in most divisions of
geological science, his particular
field has been paleontology and the
| study of shell fossils.
