# ADVANCE MADE BY ARMAMENT TREATY-ROWELL
## International Regulation, Parity And Limitation Parley Results Senate Action Needs To Be Urged By Public 
### 
"The London Naval Armament
! Treaty lias made a great advance,"
| said Chester Rowell in his speech
|on tho Naval Parley, last nighl in
, the Assembly Hall. "It has done
lAvliat the Washington Conference in
1!Â»22 failed to do. it has covered
I every possible condition of naval
j armament, it has decided that no
nation can independently determine
the size of its navy. No nation now
claims that right."
Out of this latest conference, we
have obtained two three-power
pacts, and, according to Mr. Rowell,
sooner or later we shall be meet
! ing again for a five-power pact.
I This will be made easier by the
j fact that even the admiralty now
realizes that the "purpose of navies
is no longer war."
Mr. Rowell listed the accomplish
ments of the London Parley as four
in number: parity, the limitation
and reduction of shipbuilding pro
grams, the re-establishment of the
i principle that navies shall be inter
nationally regulated, and paving
the way for future and more suc
cessful conferences.
The journalist reminded his audi
ence that this treaty was particu
larly interesting to them for, "The
president who proposes this treaty
is from this campus; the senator
who most loudly opposes this
treaty is a Calit'ornian; and the
journalist who most flagrantly mis
represents this treaty comes from
California."
Mr. Rowell criticized a leading
American columnist, for his attempt
to discredit the treaty, and the
senior senator from California for
his loud opposition to the ratifica
tion. "What we need is a strong
public opinion to force the senate
to do, for once, what, a majority
of it wishes to do," said Mr. Rowell.
"This organized opinion 1 think we
can easily take care of."
Following his speech, Mr. Rowell
'answered questions and invited dis
cussion from his audience.
