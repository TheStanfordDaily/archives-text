# GRAF ZEPPELIN CRUISES AROUND 'LION'S NOSE' ON 4,500--MILE WORLD TOUR
## Eckener Chooses Ocean Route; For Second Time During Journey Dirigible Will Cross Equator While Flying Over Mouth of Amazon River 
### 
\TATAL, Brazil, May ZH. (/p) Around the "Lion's Nose" and north
westward the Graf Zeppelin tonight swept on a 4500-mile cruise that
will take her to Havana, Lakehurst, N.J., and home to Germany.
While Friedrichshafen was liaving dinner and New Yorkers were at
lunch, the Graf passed the easternmost tip of South America al X
o'clock this afternoon, the hour of siesta in this tropical city. For a
second time, and perhaps the last, the population of Natal was thrilled

>by the view of the silvery eon
j queror of the skies.
The Graf Zeppelin, delayed for
several hours, left Pernambueo at
!t:l3 a.m. The big airship was
! drenched by an incessant rainstorm
I of several hours. It lay water-logged
lat its stubby mooring mast until
clearing skies promised a safe take
off. It. weighed many tons more
than usual. Nevertheless, when re
leased from its teither, the Zep
pelin was driven to an altitude of
; more than a thousand feet.
Kiglit hundred to a thousand
miles up the coast the voyagers
' will cross the equator for the sec
' ond time on their present journey.
, At the same time they will fly over
| the mouth of the Amazon river,
j gateway to the rubber wealth of
the world, over which no drigible
ever flew before. Here generally
; are met some cranky winds. For
this reason it was considered pos
sible the Zeppelin might be shunted
oil' the coast line either consider
ably inland or out to sea.
Passing the Amazon, only about
000 miles more of Brazil will re
main to be traversed. Guiana, with
its French, Dutch, and British areas
will then be met. Venezuela lies
beyond, with Trinidad as the pos
sible last point near the coast be
fore the Zeppelin heads into the
West Indies. '
Dr. ICckener stated before he left
Pernambueo today that he expected
to arrive at Friedrichshafon by
June !». The Graf is due at New
York not earlier than Sunday.
