"Hither L'.S.C. <>r Stanford
will win the l.t 4-A. meet Sat
urday," Dink Templeton told a
nation-wide radio audience last
night in an interview with (irant
land Rice. "For third place, the
Kast's best bet, l pick Harvard.
Krenz and Kothcrt between theni
should account for 13 or 15
points for Stanford, for both of
them will come through with
good performances."
Attributing the string of
Western victories in the meet to
the mental attitude of the in
vaders and the concentration of
material in a few colleges, Teni
pleton went on to predict new
records in the shot and discus
on Saturday, while the 100-yard
dash record and javelin mark he
also regarded as endangered.
