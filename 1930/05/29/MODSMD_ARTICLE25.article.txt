# COPIES OF QUAD ARE OUT TODAY
## Distribution Will Begin At 1 O'Clock In Union 
### 
Copies of Iho 1930 Quad will bo
distributed , this afternoon begin
ning at 1 o'elock in tlie Y.M.C.A.
lobby in the Old Union. This is
some five days sooner than the
Quad staffs had planned 1o have
the book out, due to the fact that
if was sent to press early.
Monday, Tuesday, and yesterday
Quad receipts were sold on the
campus. They may still be pur
chased in the Quad business or the
A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union
for $G each.
Most noteworthy among the sec
tions of the book is the one de
voted to the Axe. Since there lias
been no occasion for a section of
this sort before, it is distinctly
unique, and one of the most indi
vidual of the several parts, accord
ing to Stan Milne, editor.
Color Is Keynote
Color is the keynote of the 1 !>;!<!
Quad with its henna silhouettes,
photographs, and borders. Through
out' the book, including the inside
covers, this particular tone has
been used to advantage. On other
parts more brilliant shades also ap
pear, in the drawings of John Stoll,
San Francisco artist, who contri
buted several full-page pictures.
The most novel feature of the
book, however, is the "Stanford
Life" section which opens to a full
two-page reproduction of an oil
painting bv F. Sttfndish. Following
this are "0 pages devoted to photo
graphs of the various campus ac
tivities and familiar figures in ae
t ion.
Quite unique and different from
any past Stanford Quads, is the
arrangement of the senior section.
Pictures are arranged diagonally
with an intricate conventional bor
der running off tin; page.
Never before has a Quad come
eut before the time set. The editor,
Stan Milne, says it is due to Hie
co-operation and hard work of the
sophomore tryoutees on the edi
torial staff.
