# OUR LAST TIMES TOGETHER

### 
I lie last Stan lord days of the ( lass «>t 1930 arc drawing to a
close.
I'ot only seven more days will the present Seniors he wandering'
under the sun-baked colonnades to find the classrooms where they
have been listening to many lectures in the |>ast four vears. ()nlv
>e\en more days will they hurry to an eight o'clock, explain hastilv
why ]>apers are not in on time, and wonder why there are so many
long minutes in an hour. Only seven more davs.
When three-fourths of the I'nivcrsity has finished its frantic
] reparation for springs information tests, the soon-departing mem
bets ot the ( lass of 1930 will linger still a little while to walk under
the cloistered arches of the Quad and to watch a silver moon send
'.ts light shining on the low red roofs and the gold mosaics of the
Chapel. I 'or one week Stanford will belong to the Seniors alone—
.'Mid one week will be spent in reminiscing over the festivities, the
thrills, and the problems of undergraduate days. The Class of 1930
i- soon to become a part of the great Stanford family which has
perpetuated the spirit of the I niversitv in the four corners of the
globe.
It will ever remain to the pride of 1930 that the year saw the
return of the Stanford Axe. 1 his year is specially endeared to all
Stanford people.
\\ bile the Daily—the regime which is soon to sing its sad fare
well to campus- readers—is especially touched with the sorrowful
sentiments of departure—and while it has seen many evidences of
a lingering fondness for the fast-disappearing shores of Lagnnita,
and the shady elms of Las it en—it is conscious that there are many
Seniors who will hear the call ot home so keenly that the fair walks
and low green foothills will he deserted all too soon.
Although it is regarded as somewhat collegiate to rush away
t rom the I niversit\ before the diplomas are given out, the Daily
believes that one of the I'niversitv's most pleasant features is
missed. Ii is fitting to end four years with ceremonies and gifts—
a significant closing and beginning for the new life of Stanford
men and women.
Senior gifts, promenades, endowments, halls, baccalaureate ad
dresses, and the presentation of the diplomas themselves—-these are
the final activities of the ( lass of,, 1930.
It is indeed appropriate that Seniors—for themselves and for
Stanford spend their last davs together.

why ]>apers are not in on time, and wonder why there are so many
long minutes in an hour. Only seven more davs.
When three-fourths of the I'nivcrsity has finished its frantic
] reparation for springs information tests, the soon-departing mem
bets ot the ( lass of 1930 will linger still a little while to walk under
the cloistered arches of the Quad and to watch a silver moon send
'.ts light shining on the low red roofs and the gold mosaics of the
Chapel. I 'or one week Stanford will belong to the Seniors alone—
.'Mid one week will be spent in reminiscing over the festivities, the
thrills, and the problems of undergraduate days. The Class of 1930
i- soon to become a part of the great Stanford family which has
perpetuated the spirit of the I niversitv in the four corners of the
globe.
It will ever remain to the pride of 1930 that the year saw the
return of the Stanford Axe. 1 his year is specially endeared to all
Stanford people.
\\ bile the Daily—the regime which is soon to sing its sad fare
well to campus- readers—is especially touched with the sorrowful
sentiments of departure—and while it has seen many evidences of
a lingering fondness for the fast-disappearing shores of Lagnnita,
and the shady elms of Las it en—it is conscious that there are many
Seniors who will hear the call ot home so keenly that the fair walks
and low green foothills will he deserted all too soon.
Although it is regarded as somewhat collegiate to rush away
t rom the I niversit\ before the diplomas are given out, the Daily
believes that one of the I'niversitv's most pleasant features is
missed. Ii is fitting to end four years with ceremonies and gifts—
a significant closing and beginning for the new life of Stanford
men and women.
Senior gifts, promenades, endowments, halls, baccalaureate ad
dresses, and the presentation of the diplomas themselves—-these are
the final activities of the ( lass of,, 1930.
It is indeed appropriate that Seniors—for themselves and for
Stanford spend their last davs together.
