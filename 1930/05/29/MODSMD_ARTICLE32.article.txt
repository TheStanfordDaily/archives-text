# OUR LAST TIMES TOGETHER
## 
### 
The last Stanford days of the Class of 1930 are drawing to a
close.
For only seven more days will the present Seniors be wandering
under the sun-baked colonnades to find the classrooms where they
have been listening to many lectures in the past four years. Only
seven more days will they hurry to an eight o'clock, explain hastily
why papers are not in on time, and wonder why there are so many
long minutes in an hour. Only seven more days.
When three-fourths of the University has finished its frantic
] reparation for springs information tests, the soon-departing mem
bers of the Class of 1930 will linger still a little while to walk under
the cloistered arches of the Quad and to watch a silver moon send
its light shining on the low red roofs and the gold mosaics of the
Chapel. For one week Stanford will belong to the Seniors alone —
and one week will be spent in reminiscing over the festivities, the
thrills, and the problems of undergraduate days. The Class of 1930
is soon to become a part of the great Stanford family which has
perpetuated the spirit of the University in the four corners of the
globe.
It will ever remain to the pride of 1930 that the year saw the
return of the Stanford Axe. This year is specially endeared to all
Stanford people.
\\ bile the Daily—the regime which is soon to sing its sad fare
well to campus readers — is especially touched with the sorrowful
sentiments of departure — and while it has seen many evidences of
a lingering fondness for the fast-disappearing shores of Lagunita,
and the shady elms of Lasuen — it is conscious that there are many
Seniors who will hear the call of home so keenly that the fair walks
and low green foothills will be deserted all too soon.
Although it is regarded as somewhat collegiate to rush away
from the University before the diplomas are given out, the Daily
believes that one of the University's most pleasant features is
missed. It is fitting to end four years with ceremonies and gifts —
a significant closing and beginning for the new life of Stanford
men and women.
Senior gifts, promenades, endowments, halls, baccalaureate ad
dresses, and the presentation of the diplomas themselves—-these are
the final activities of the ( lass of,, 1930.
It is indeed appropriate that Seniors—for themselves and for
Stanford spend their last davs together.
