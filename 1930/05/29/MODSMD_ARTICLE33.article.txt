# THE
						SENIOR ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
Seniors traditionally have been accused of being dignified, pa
ternal, and fully conscious of their main responsibilities. Despite
the many instances at hand to offset this opinion, it is good to
witness the serious thought and purpose behind the Class of 1930
General Endowment fund, for which the campaign for pledges is
now in progress. Xow that the Seniors are entering the home
stretch toward graduation after their four-year race against smoke
rps and grade points, they are sufficiently thoughtful to check up
on the many advantages of their sojourn here. That the average
prospective graduate has a feeling of appreciation and loyalty to
ward Stanford is evidenced by the willingness of each graduating
i lass to perform in future years some service for the I'niversitv.
The choice of the (ieneral Alumni bund by this vear's Senior
< lass appears to be wise and broad visioned. This fund is a mobile
one to be used at the discretion of the President for the many
worthy causes and emergencies which cannot be foreseen or pro
vided for in the annual budget. Contrary to some opinion, the dona
lions to the fund are not pooled with the general assets of the I'ni
versitv to be expended for janitor service, the printing of flunk
notices, or for other ordinary running expenses. The President
carefully administers these moneys with the purpose of the alumni
donators in mind. A certain professor needs monev to aid him in
publishing a hook that represents a life's work, an important piece
of research must be forwarded, a needy student requires aid—these
and many other worthy ends can be served by the generosity of the
senior class in pledging donations for the future.
