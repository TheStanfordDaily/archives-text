THE KRAMER GIRLS. By Ruth
Suckow. Alfred Knopf, New
York. 1930. At the Stanford
Bookstore.
Through the medium ot' Ruth
Snckow's simple, effective style, we
live for a moment the lives of
"The Kramer Girls" in the small
middle-western town of Valley
Junction. There is Georgia Kramer,
I big, rough, masculine, who hears
1 ho hrunt of the family's hard
work. It, is she who sacrifices her
life for the pleasures of others;
I stays home with her invalid mother
'so that Annie can go to the ehui;ch
socio 1; wheedles the money from
her commonplace father, so that
Hose can go to college. She wants
Itose, the youngest, brainiest, and
most popular of the Kramers, to do
i big things in the world. Hut Rose
is not the executive type. She has
to be pushed into things. She would
rather marry Archie, and sii in
the ♦in, feeling vaguely, dreamily
happy over her family; soaking in
the warm rays for a moment before
she goes into the kitchen to do her
middleclass housework.
Rose at least lias a will of her
own. She does what she wants.
Annie is frivolous, vacillating, al
ways agreeing with everyone. As
long as Georgia is alive, slit; takes
care of Annie, but. when Georgia,
dies, Annie becomes reconciled to
being an old maid, working in llof
t baler's store.
Then there are minor characters
that live for their moment, and are
gone. Old Mr. Yarborough, a "sort
Of philosopher"; Mrs. Pick, who
calls about, dinner time to gossip
and eat; the svelte Jane, Rose's col
lege friend, hard, brilliant, sophisti
cated; Denny, dark and sincere;

the schoolteachers and tlie basket
ball gills and the old German lady
who thinks Georgia is the most
wonderful person on earth; and
Archie's mother, small and eager;
nil delineated with the quick care
lid strokes of I'utli Suckow's exact
pen.
Thousands of stories like this
have been written; doubtless thou
sands more will be written, but no
present-day author can chronicle
the everyday doings of everyday
people with the insight and sincer
ity of Itutli Suckow. She knows all
the quirks of the small-town indi
viduals of which she writes.
However, "The Kramer Girls" is
not quite up to the author's former
work. At times she slips from sim
plicity to sentimentality, and the
beauty of her work suffers. There is
a certain essential hardness lack
ing from"The Kramer Girls."
L. U.
PARAMOUNT ON PARADE — At
the New Stanford Theatre.
Paramount passes on parade at
the New Stanford in all its entire
ty. Muddy Uogers and Lillian lloth
i do a nifty sang and dance number
to a good tune, "Anytime's the
Time to Fall in Love." Helen Kane
has a 800-Poopa-l)oo class for tiny
lots and little Mitzie Green, one
of her pupils, does the best, number
in the whole show. Maurice Cheva
lier and Nancy Carroll twinkle
brightly and even Clara Flow
basks once again in the lime
light. Ruth Cnatlerton's war skit
is well-done as one would naturally
expect. A well-trained chorus
creates some esthetic effects and
the technicolor, where it appears,
[is the best yet.

Through the medium ot' Ruth
Snckow's simple, effective style, we
live for a moment the lives of
"The Kramer Girls" in the small
middle-western town of Valley
Junction. There is Georgia Kramer,
I big, rough, masculine, who hears
1 ho hrunt of the family's hard
work. It, is she who sacrifices her
life for the pleasures of others;
I stays home with her invalid mother
'so that Annie can go to the ehui;ch
socio 1; wheedles the money from
her commonplace father, so that
Hose can go to college. She wants
Itose, the youngest, brainiest, and
most popular of the Kramers, to do
i big things in the world. Hut Rose
is not the executive type. She has
to be pushed into things. She would
rather marry Archie, and sii in
the ♦in, feeling vaguely, dreamily
happy over her family; soaking in
the warm rays for a moment before
she goes into the kitchen to do her
middleclass housework.
Rose at least lias a will of her
own. She does what she wants.
Annie is frivolous, vacillating, al
ways agreeing with everyone. As
long as Georgia is alive, slit; takes
care of Annie, but. when Georgia,
dies, Annie becomes reconciled to
being an old maid, working in llof
t baler's store.
Then there are minor characters
that live for their moment, and are
gone. Old Mr. Yarborough, a "sort
Of philosopher"; Mrs. Pick, who
calls about, dinner time to gossip
and eat; the svelte Jane, Rose's col
lege friend, hard, brilliant, sophisti
cated; Denny, dark and sincere;

the schoolteachers and tlie basket
ball gills and the old German lady
who thinks Georgia is the most
wonderful person on earth; and
Archie's mother, small and eager;
nil delineated with the quick care
lid strokes of I'utli Suckow's exact
pen.
Thousands of stories like this
have been written; doubtless thou
sands more will be written, but no
present-day author can chronicle
the everyday doings of everyday
people with the insight and sincer
ity of Itutli Suckow. She knows all
the quirks of the small-town indi
viduals of which she writes.
However, "The Kramer Girls" is
not quite up to the author's former
work. At times she slips from sim
plicity to sentimentality, and the
beauty of her work suffers. There is
a certain essential hardness lack
ing from"The Kramer Girls."
