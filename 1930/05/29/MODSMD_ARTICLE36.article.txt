The Editor, Sir:
Without a doubt we're all wrong
j as the "500" seems to be most of
' the time, but we certainly were
startled upon discovering that prac
! tice days for women's sports were
1 listed in the Time Schedule for
• Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Something new and different, it
| seems, to have a class on Friday,
and upon thinking it over not such
: a bright idea.
We always thought that partici
pation in sports fostered the much
desired sportsmanship, and was an
• aid to forming lasting friendships.
Also that physical education was

and encouraged in the upper divi
! sion for the same reason.
However, the person, or persons,

. who planned the schedule, must
have overlooked that the majority
of women students is occupied in
required living group or organiza
tion social functions such as teas,
etc., on Friday afternoons.
We predict the end of women's
sports!
Our next gripe on the subject
is the fact that, according to this
schedule, freshmen taking there-
I quired laboratory science will he
! unable to go out for the season
sport—hockey—since the hour is
fixed for 3 o'clock.
We have just one more little
question. Why should swimming
and diving be put together? Each
one is a full course in itself and
combining the two will lead to a
faint improvement in both, rather
than a marked improvement in one.
