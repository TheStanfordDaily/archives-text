jits most important feature is a yoke

I makes possible pressures up to 300
i pounds per square inch upon ihe
j shaft.
The experiments are being con
j ducted to discover the most effi
cient and economic conditions of oil
pressure, maximum load, and high
speed. The present research is to
t determine the running positions of
the shaft within the bearing by
means of micrometers reading to
hundred-thousandths of an inch,
and to determine pressures in the
oil film.
