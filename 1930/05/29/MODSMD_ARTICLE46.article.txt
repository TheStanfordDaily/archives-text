# DAMES WILL HEAR LECTURE ON WIFE'S HELP FOR HUSBAND
## 
### 
Mrs. Elizabeth Snell. Secretary
|of the Appointment Office, will
speak at a meeting of the Stanford
Dames in the Women's Clubhouse
Thursday afternoon, June 5, at 5:110
o'clock. Her subject will be "The
Place of a Superintendent's Wife
in a Town."
Mrs. Snell said yesterday, "There
has been much discussion lately at
meetings of the Dames on the ques
tion of how a woman can best help
her husband. Can she further his
advance by being a leader herself
or by remaining in the background?
This question arose first about the
wives of school superintendents,
but the same answer applies to the
wives of all men holding executive
positions."
There will also be a round table
discussion of the subject. The day
will be the club's quarterly guest
day, and all members are invited
to bring their friends.
