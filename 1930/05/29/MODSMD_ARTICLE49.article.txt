BIGGER AND BETTER
With Stanford winding up
its 1930 track season at Cam
bridge tomorrow and Saturday
in what is hoped to be a burst
of glory, a glance into the fu
ture is not amiss. And, gazing
intently into the crystal ball,
our staff medium reveals the
interesting information that
the Cardinal varsity of 1931
should be potentially much
stronger than the collection of
notable stars performing under
Dink Templeton's direction this
year.
In the face of the loss of such
sterling performers as Erie Krenz,
Harlow Rothert, Johnny Morrison,
Virg Dowell, Mayor Shove, Merry,
Madison, Bramel, and Pleishiiaeker,
such a statement may well be
looked upon askance, it is, indeed,
doubtful that any other college
track squad could face with equan
imity thu departure of a world's
champion discus thrower, an inter
collegiate champion shot-putter,
and the nation's leading quarter
-1 filler.
And yet next spring there
will be gathered under the
Cardinal banner an excess of
talent to replace the departed
luminaries. Heirs to the Krenz-
Rothert weight-tossing scepters
are to be found in Crown
Princes Here Laborde and Nel
lie Gray, products of the class
of 1933 who are expected to
extend the Stanford weight
monopoly for three more years.
Perhaps in jest, perhaps with
the idea of encouraging Krenz
and Rothert to greater efforts,
perhaps seriously, Coach Tem
pleton predicts that before La
borde and Gray conclude their
competition for Stanford the
marks of their illustrious for
bears will be erased from the
boards to make way for some
thing newer and better.
To fill the shoes of Johnny-Mor
rison,: two Cinderellas of the quar
ter-mile advance expectantly. Ben
Bangs Eastman, adjudged the most
promising 440 prospect ever to at
tend Stanford, is likely to liiul his
lape-breakitig efforts threatened by
a teammate, the at present ineligi
ble Les Hables, an even greater
4-10 man than his brother Ike, who
also returns to the fold. Les, who
no slouch as a sprinter, may
have the quarter-mile honors to
Ben Bangs, and devote his energies
to battling Dyer in the dashes.
But regardless of whatever
other events he enters, Les is
a cinch to run a lap of the re
lay, and with Eastman. Ike
Hables, and Jimmy Howell
making up the rest of the team
the Cardinal 1931 baton-pasing
quartet should hammer at the
world's record every time they
run.
Encouragement to Stanford's
chances in the middle distances,
events from which Templeton has
this season been able to squeeze
but few points, is to be found in
the presence fo Allan Storms, an
other prominent 1930 ineligible.
Storms, small but stockily built,
with an iron heart and legs of steel,
will run either half-mile or mile,
and is bound to make his presence
felt.
Add to these men Austin in
the poievault, Herbert in the
hurdles, and Blackman in the
broadjurnp and highjump—all
three freshmen —plus the track
men who will be back next
year, including Dyer. Smith,
Howell u Hables, Brown,, Par
ker, West, Butler, Grey, Jones,
Giberson, Nisbet, Cooper, At
kinson, and others, and the pos
sibilities for next year appear
practically unlimited.
