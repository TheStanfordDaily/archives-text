# BIG BOY BARNEY.....
## Pennsylvania Wonder Stars in Decathlon; He Can Put Shot 49 Feet, Pole Vault 13 Feet 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Shades of Jim Thorpe and Fred
Thomson! Do you think that either
of those great old-time all-around
athletes could beat Barney Berlin
ger of the University of Pennsyl
vania? There's no way of telling,
for they set marks in all-around
competition, while Barney com
petes in the Decathlon, but the
large and smiling Mr. Berlinger
will give anyone a run for his
money in,either contest, no doubt
about that, unless his opponent is
a combination Hercules and Mer
cury.
Barney Berlinger is a bit of such
a combination himself, with quite a
lot of Apollo thrown in for looks.
To see him (and he's easy to see,
because he is everywhere on the
field in a dual meet, skipping from
one event to another) you'd never
dream that a lad heavy enough to
put the shot better than 49 feet
could he agile enough to pole vault
better than 13 feet. In the Indoor
1.C.4-A. meet in 1929, Berlinger

vaulted 13 feet 4% inches, and in
the outdoor meet the same year he
put the shot 49 feet 3% inches, to
hold second place until Eric Krenz,
the 1928 champion, finally un
leashed -a 50-foot heave. He also
tied for second in the high jump.
In the Indoor 1.C.4-A. meet in 1929
he placed in four events, and in the
meet last March in three, and that
in as classy a meet for competition
j as is held anywhere.
, Penti is counting on this happy
go-lucky kid for a lot of points in
the Intercollegiates on May 31. He
scored 15 points, in five events, in
the dual meet with Yale on May 3.
There seems to be no limit to his
endurance in an all-around compe
tition, except in the mile run, which
he hates like poisonâ€”almost: as bad
as studying! Barney won the Sep
tatlilon (7-event test) at the Illinois
relay carnival the last two years,
and likewise the Decathlon at the
Penn relays. This year his point
total for tiie grueling ten-event test
I was 7,460.608, a new record.
