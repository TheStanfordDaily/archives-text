## 
### 
Questions concerning (lie new
hours for women's gymnasium
classes fall quarter as listed in the
time schedule were considered of
four appointed at the W.A.A. Board
meeting Wednesday night. Commit
tee members are: liosamonde
Clarke, Louise Artz, Jane Snyder,
and Met a Jury.
The hoard felt that Friday
classes were not advisable since
tlx; majority of students, especially
those in the upper division for
whom the gym was not required,
either were at home or off the
campus Friday afternoons, or busy
with social functions. It was also
suggested that if other classes fin
ished by noon Friday, they should
be free to have the afternoon with
out gymnasium, and would conse
quently not enroll.
l)i'. Dyment said that the system
of classes had been changed and
that in order to have each sport
three times a week, instead of the
former two or four, Friday classes
would have to be used. Also all
classes had ben condensed since the
physical education s.'aff ,\vas to
include only three instructors next
year instead of the present four.
This is due to a decrease in the
budget.
Another question concerned the
hour at which freshman hockey
had been scheduled, MWF nnd
TThF at :! o'clock. The committee
pointed out that freshmen who
took laboratory sciences would be
unable to take hockey, and thai
the benefits derived from class as
sociation on the athletic field would
b< greater if there were one large
class, as lias been customary.
The committee also asked for
competitive tennis, and separate
diving and Vwimming classes, which
Â« hanges will probal>ly be granted.
