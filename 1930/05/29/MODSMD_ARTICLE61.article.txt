# SAUTER, HANDBALL STAR, IS HONORED WITH GOLD MEDAL
## 
### 
John Sauter, outstanding Stan
ford handball star and recent co
winner of the University doubles
handball championship, was yes
terday presented with a gold medal
by Myron Sprague, director of the
sport, in recognition of his stellar
work during the past season.
Although handicapped by illness
during the start of the season and
defeated by several collegiate ri
vals before he had returned to tip
top condition, Sauter never ceased
in his efforts to secure the recogni
tion for handball which the sport
deserves.
After recovering from an illness,
Sauter met and defeated the men
who had downed'him earlier in the
season, and has yet to lose a single
set to an intercollegiate rival since
his return to form.
