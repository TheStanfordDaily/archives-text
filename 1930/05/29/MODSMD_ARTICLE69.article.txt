# STUDENT'S RECORD MUST BE 180 PLUS 0 TO RECEIVE DEGREE
## Recommendation Of Major Department Also Requirement 
### 
When is ;i graduate not a gradu
ate? In answer to many frenzied
queries from worried seniors, As
sistant Registrar Karl M. Cowdery
issued yesterday the graduation re
quirements.
"The only rule of the Registrar's
Office," said Cowdery, "is the dou
ble requirement of 180 units and a
'(" average on Stanford work. In
ether words, the student must stand
180 plus 0 or better to receive his
diploma.
"However," he continued, "recom
mendation from the student's ma
jor department upon satisfactory
completion of requirements and
grades in departmental courses is
the third essential for graduation."
To illustrate the ruling, Cowdery
gave several examples. If a senior
has a Uawlout standing of 105 plus
25, fifteen hours must be passed.
Thus if he receives all "D's" to go
1 5 minus 15, lie would ordinarily
go on probation. However, his total
will he 180 plus 10 which fills the
requirement of 180 plus 0 or better.
As graduation comes before proba
tion. the senior, as far as the Regis
trar's Office is concerned, will re
ceive his diploma. However, there
would be a strong possibility of the
student's major department refus
ing to recommend him.
On the other hand, if the senior
has a standing of 1(!5 plus 10, and
in the last, quarter went 15 minus
15, he would not graduate as his
total would be 180 minus 5, five
grade points under the minimum.
"Contrary to popular belief," con
cluded the Assistant Registrar, "a
'(" average is not necessary in a
senior's last, quarter as long as he
finished out 180 plus 0 or better.
Hut a 'C average is desired to he
sure of departmental recommenda
tion."
