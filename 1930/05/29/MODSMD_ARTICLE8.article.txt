# HOUSE REVISES SHOALS LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
## Senate Consent Necessary For Passage; Chances Believed Slight Bill Would Require Sale Of Surplus Power 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 28. (/P> !
Thrusting aside protests against j
private operation of Muscle Shoals, !
the House today accepted ihe |
Recce plan for leasing the project
as a substitute for the Senate reso- |
lution proposing government opera- !
t ion.
The bill now goes to the Senate i
for agreement to the change. Its I
( hances of approval there were be- i
licved slight and it was expected |
to be sent to conference.
As finally adopted by the; House i
by a record vote of 19(» to 114, the
measure would authorize appoint- j
ment. by the President, of a board j
of three persons to negotiate leases j
with one or more companies within j
a year and a half. The lessee would i
be required to produce 10,000 tons j
of nitrogen for fertilizer in i
years, and to increase this produc- j
tiori annually as market demands
warranted.
Surplus power would be sold, first j
to the states, counties, or munici- j
palities, and then to private com-1
panics. Construction of the Cove
Creek dam at the headwaters of |
the Tennessee river also would be j
required of the operator as a meas- j
ure of increasing the power pro- j
duct ion and to aid flood control |
and navigation.
The leasing board would be given j
discretionary power to order con- |
slruction of dam number three, I
about 15 miles upstream from the
existing dam number two.
Through two long days of dis- I
pute, the plan was alternately com- j
mended as the "most rational" j
solution of the problem ever of- i
t'ered to the House, and assailed as I
a "gift" to the power interests. j
