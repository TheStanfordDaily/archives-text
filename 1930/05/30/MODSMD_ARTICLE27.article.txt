# A.S.S.U. FINANCES NOT TO SUPPORT DRAMATIC GROUP
## 
### 
Agreeing that the A.S.S.U.
wits in no way responsible for
the financial solvency oi! the
Dramatic Council, the Ex Com
mittee last night moved that
the student manager be in no
way accountable for any ob
ligations assumed by the
Council, and instructed the
manager not to advance any
money to the Dramatic body
without the express consent
of the Ex Committee.
Taking this step "because
of the continued procrastina
tion of the Dramatic Coun
cil ... to re'ach o solution
of its financial condition . . .
the Ex Committee is of the
opinion that the Council must
realize that lhey cannot as
sume that the A.S.S.U. will
eventually absorb their debts."
