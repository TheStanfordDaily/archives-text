# JUST SOME CORRESPONDENCE

I )ear (iale :
Across this 2 x 4 office where I Have held sway for the last half
vear I can see quite distinctly, as I write, the aurora which marks
vonivpresenee. Hut instead of shout in;.; niv message across to yon, I
shall use this more enduring means of communication.
NOn see, I think yon deserve a kindly word of warning. We
have been friends for a lorlg time now. Red, and 1 can't sit idly by,
permitting you to walk blindly into this thing of being an editor.
My energy is probably wasted. Von will read what I have
written, and then do you please. 1 know because I once listened
to words of wisdom from a fellow named Kinry. I listened, and
then promptly forgot what he said.
Hut anyhow, no one. can now say that I am not trying to do the
right thing by you.
If you ever took a course in the tricky science of polities from
J )r. Barclay you will remember that Mark 11 anna placed high
value on the skin of a rhinoceros as one of the necessary attributes
for a successful politician. Xow Mark probably wasn't much inter
ested in this newspaper business, but take it from nYe, Red, he ut
tered one big mouthful of journalistic advice. This summer von
must spend a lot of time working on your hide. Alake it tough and
thick and strong. Lor that hide <jf yours is going to take an awful
beating when you settle down in this editorial chair.
You will find that the editor is expected to please evervone.
You must please the administration: you must please the faculty;
you must please the Live Hundred: you must please fraternity
men, hall men. sorority girls and Robleites you must please the
alumni, the football team, the coaching staff, the Hoard of Trustees,
the Y.M.C. A., the C ommittee on Public Ivxercises, the Physics De
partment, the School of [Engineering, the Dramatic Council, the Lx
C ommittee, and the San Francisco .Newspapers—you must please
the \A\ .S.. the Women's Physical F.ducation Department, the
Daily staff, and the general public.
There are some more whom you must please, but -I can't think
of them just now. Anyway, the above is. iu a nutshell, the job you
have picked out for yourself.
Right now you are probably happy in the illusion that you have
a fair grasp of the rudiments of journalism. I felt that way too.
Hut you will discover (as I discovered) that you are wrong. You
know nothing about journalism. People will let out that fact next
fall when they come around to the office to tell you just how the
Daily should be run. .Yot long after you get to work, delegations
representing most of the above-mentioned groups, will wait on you
both literallv and figuratively: they will write you campus opinion
letters: they will discuss your ignorance when they gather on street
corners.
Perhaps you'll even find some broadminded department head
who is willing to censor votir news stories and check your headlines ;
a department bead who will get sore when you decline to put him
to all that trouble.
And always, friend Clale. you shall have with you the women.
Like death and taxes thev are inevitable. You are destined to have
a lot of trouble with the women. 1 don't know why; but that is
like death and taxes, too.
Right now the\ vearn for $10,000,000, so that there can be
more women on the Farm. More women mean more trouble —but
help them get that modest sum, anyhow. After all, we do want
the women, don't we? (Xow I ask you.)
< )h. it's a goofy game, this college editor business. You write
an editorial about something. Presto! You are at once a black
guard and a saint :an intellectual louse and a mental giant: a builder
and a wrecker: a defender of truth and a defamer of Stanford's
name. It witl bewilder you. but don't worry about it all too much.
Consider yourself a saint, a mental giant, a builder, and a defender
of the truth. And let it go at that.
I've been lucky as editor. I've had you and I'artlett as assistant
editors: Ted DeMotte as managing editor: little Sylva Weaver for
a women's editor: and Hal Terwilliger for business manager.
About Miss Weaver I could write a couple of letters. She's
been a newspaper woman with a man's point of view. I ler work
has been faithful and of the greatest value; I have sought her ad
vice and have found it good. To her I offer thanks.
And good old llal! lie was a surprise. I had an idea, when I
took this job, that all business managers were bad medicine; that
they were money grabbers and general nuisances. That is why I
was surprised in Hal. He was good medicine: he was no monev
grabber and he was no nuisance at all. Ile co-operated and was at
all times helpful.
I hope, for your sake Red. that those who supplant yourself and
I'artlett and DeMotte and Weaver and Terwilliger will tear a leaf
out of the book of their immediate predecessors.
1 Jut this has gone quite far enough. As I said before, you won't
pav much attention anyhow.
So I'll just fold up this aged typewriter for the last time, and
shuffle out of the*dear old joint. • lood luck to you, (iale!
Yours,
Bob.
P. S. Remember, always, that monkeying with syllabus sheets and
the sanctity of the classroom is like attempting the hare handed
capture of a wild kangaroo on a field covered with nice ripe banana
peelings.
