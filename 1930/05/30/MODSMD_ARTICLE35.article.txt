COPY, 1930. Stories, Plays,
Poems, and Essays. .Selected
by Joseph Auslander, Lorna R.
F. Birtwell, Dorothy Scarbo
rough, Ernest Brennecke, Helen
Hull, Warren E. Schutt, D.
Appleton & Co., New York.
( opy, 1930, is the seventh of an
annual selection of the published work
of students in the special courses in
writing, University • Extension, to
ltimbiii University. It is surprisingly
uninteresting. Compared to the Lin
coln High School, New York, anthol
ogy of poetry, it shows little promise.
\pparently the talented writers of
New York do not take university ex
tension courses in authorship.
Among the short stories, there is
only one worth the reading. That
one is "Hot Copy" by M. C. Black
man. Obviously a newspaperman
himself, Mr. Blackmail relates in di
rect journalistic fashion the story of
a "scoop." This is not just another
newspaper story. It is really much
more concerned with the characters of
the crania which the journalist reports
than with the city desk or its foibles.
The essays in Copy are the usual
magazine type, light and popular sub- |
jects dealt with in good uninspired |
writing. The verse is almost equally '
uninspired except for Mary Kinetic j
Barber's "To a Man of Action" which 1
appeared some time ago in Poetry; i
A Magazine or-Verse.
Copy contains but one play, a melo
drama by Alice Timoney and Anne
Collins, entitled "Wilderness Road."
It is too obvious to be even faintly I
amusing, and the drama instead of '
being tragic is pathetic.
Copy, 1930, does not speak well for
the Columbia Cniversity courses in
writing.
ROON, A BROCHURE OF
MODERN VERSE. Edited and
published by Ruth Mentz, Stan
ford University.
"Roon," as a footnote explains, is j
published at Stanford Cniversity '

I
(with which, however, it has no ofti- j
da! connected) by a group for which
ver-e is a delightful hobby, indulged
in in moments stolen from too busy
and too practical careers. The edit
ing, and part of the printing, is done
at these odd times. It is issued twice
yearly ofteiicr, if time will allow.
"Noon" is bound in green and gold,
and printed on a huff heavy bond, i
The frontispiece is a striking linoleum '
cut executed and signed by I boring- \
ton Putnam.- Entitled "Patriiarch,"
the cut is remarkably successful in
catching the age defined, wisdom re
fined features of a veteran.
Ii would be folly to rate the indi
vidual poems in the matter ol excell
ence. I'oetry, as other art, is success
ful to the degree that it recreates in
its audience the identical emotion in
which it was conceived. C'onsedered
in this light, most of the poems in this
issue of "Noon" are more than nor
mally effective.
"Shadows," by Yvor Winters robes
a remote philosophy with velvet. I)e- |
spite the maturity of this livc-quat
raincd piece, there is a tinge of bit
terness resentfully cognizant of fact.
The poem is skillfully wrought.
"'fhe Karth-Mound" by Janet Lewis
Lewis is like the benediction of a
young woman, intuitive and slightly
rippling. Two poems by Burnetii Ka- !
gawa leave one a bit dazed by quickly
changing vistas.
Xnel Stern's three contributions
show a love of prliase and life, llis
"Live iu a Song" is particularly pleas
ing. "Kathleen Lydon" is quite obvi- j
ously the work of a young person but
shows an estecmable agility for ar
resting metaphor.
Last but bv no means least are three
poems by the guiding spirit of "Noon." i
Miss Ruth Mantz. Her capacity to
compose work-music of refined phrase
is unusually impressive and beautiful.
