j More, i> meant than meets the eye
—even in Stanford Daily editorials if '
'we are to take seriously the recent
j journalistic outburst at Mills College
(over an alleged implication in the Wo
men's lulition.
It seems that Vlills coeds have risen '
in wrath over the inference that they
; are "beautiful" but dumb, following
is an excerp from the Mills Weekly: !
"Mills graciously accepts the com
pliment inferred by 111i> representative
of the Stanford 500 in admitting the
i statement of the reputed beauty of j
j Mills students but it will not tolerate j
the implication that Mills girls are;
beautiful but dumb. Students enter
Mills under heavy academic require
nients, and no one of them can remain
<iii her good looks.
"We aslc for a revision of Miss ,
Weaver's statement. In modesty we j
modify the first, and in righteous self- j
defense we include the last. Let us :
grant that Mills girls are attractive!
and also agree they have high I.Q.'s".
Indeed Miss Weaver would be only
too glad to revise her statement —or
at least the conception of her statement '
I which seems to have reached Mills
i College.
' Miss Weaver did not say that Mills
girls were beautiful. She doesn't
even think so. Slit merely said that
i the men's traditional attitude toward
Stanford women—was that Mills 1
girls were beautiful. It is an attitude
| on the part of the men and not a plain i
fact, and , there were no inferences '
whatever in it.
There is a traditional attitude to
ward Stanford women. It is banded
down from college generation to gen- '
eration and implanted in freshmen's
minds when they first enter Kncina
I fhe reason for this attitude—at least i
I am convinced it is so—is the 500
limit which creates an artificial social
unit surrounded by a delusion of '
scholastic cxclusiveness and the gla
mour ol a six to one ratio. That this
is only an altitude is my firm belief

| —and many of the liberal-minded
| Stanford men w ill admit it.
The small size of the women's
i group leads to the feeling that Stan
I ford is for men. Mrs. Stanford want
ed it thus yet one wonders if Leland
Stanford Junior would not have pre
ferred a few more feminine playmates.
The 500 limit gives a "small but Hti
j cicnt administrative unit and one
1 on which it is all too easy to inflict
| severe and irrational rules.
. Miss Weaver did Hot sa> Mills
girls were beautiful but that tlu: tra
ditional attitude ol Stanford men in
eluded this impression of Mills coeds.,
i As a matter of fact, not attitude,
] Stanford women are just as beautiful,
( charming, intelligent, and full of per
sonality--or even more o than any
other group of college women in the
! country.
( If Mills coeds resent the attitude
that represents them as "beautiful,"
perhaps they would like to join the
112 ive Hundred's ranks to eliminate the
prejudice of Stanford men and help
find the Ten Million.
Sincerely,
The Women',s F.ditor.
