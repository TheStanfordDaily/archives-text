# STUDENT INDUSTRY PROJECT OFFERED TO UPPER CLASSES
## Students lo Secure Jobs In San Francisco This Summer 
### 
An opportunity to study indus
trial situations and obtain practi
cal experience in the field of in
dustry is being offered students of
junior, senior, or graduate stand
ing in the summer project, Stu
dents in Industry. Almon E. Iloth,
Stanford comptroller, is a member
of the advisory committee, and
John Way is chairman of the
executive committee.
This summer a group of college
men and women, probably inter
racial. will meet in San Francisco
to work live weeks with their
hands, for wages. This will be the
second time, in California, that stu
dcnts have gone into industry for
part of their vacation.
This is not a money-making pro
ject; wages in the past have bare
ly paid expenses. It is not a lark,
nor does the group go to San Fran
cisco for sight-seeing or visiting
friends. Each student finds his own
living place and is required not to
live with family or friends. Each
(student finds his own job in the
industry of his choice or wherever
employment is available.
Seminar groups will meet once
or twice a week, as the leader will
arrange. Prominent men and wo
men in the labor and industrial
world will address the group.
The project which begins July 4
with a house party near Sail Fran
cisco to acquaint the members of
the group with each other, ends
August 10, the last two days to be
spent in conference to evaluate the
experiences. Students who have
jobs they wish to continue with,
may do so.
Application blanks may be ob
tained from the Y.W.C.A. or
Y.M.C.A. rooms and the project is
open to both men and women.
Qualifications include a letter of
recommendation from some mem
ber of tlie college faculty and a
physician's certificate.
