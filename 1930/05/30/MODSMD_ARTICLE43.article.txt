# REDUCTIONS IN COST FOR WOMEN'S GYM SUGGESTED TODAY
## 
### 
Although nothing can definitely
be settled concerning the plans for
I the women's gymnasium until the
engineers' and architects' reports
' concerning the proposed cuts have
come in, Ernest S. Erwin, in charge
of the work, declares that the
plans can probably be cut satisfac
torily and that building will start
i soon.
In order to reduce the present
plans to the available $225,000 two
of the three swimming pools will
be eliminated. This will reduce the
cost by roughly $19,000, Also elimi
nation of all linoleum which was
to cover the floors of the offices,
etc., would save $2,000; not paint
ing the inside of the gymnasium
I $2,900 and substituiug cement for
promenade tile in the colonade
would save $1800. Other items are
under consideration.
All the cuts are being made with
the idea in mind that at some t'u-
I ture date or when enough money
j is obtained, the things eliminated
may be incorporated in the build
ing. The plans as they stand do
not cover any athletic fields or new
tennis courts.
The women are expected to raise
$20,000 for furniture and equip
ment. such as dressing rooms, etc.,
by the time the building is up.
The chalices are that the building
will be ready for use next winter
quarter, if new plans do not have
to he drawn up, in which case Ihe
I whole work would be postponed
J some six months.
