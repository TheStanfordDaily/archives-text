Today and tomorrow will tell
the tale.
Whether Mr. Robert Lyman
Templeton's 18 stalwarts walk
off with the intercollegiate title
for the fourth successive year,
or whether the boys from
Southern California hand the
Cards their third and final lick
ing of this season will be a
matter of history tomorrow
night. And in the interim Stan
ford track enthusiasts will keep
their ears glued to the nearest
radio loudspeaker to catch
the latest tidings from the
Eastern front.
Jus( how the Cardinal anil Tro
jan representatives tare in today's
I rials may vv*• 11 decide (Iks issue
before llie final conflict. Particu
larly in the shot-put, discus, javelin
throw, and hroadjump, where llie
best mark made in either trials or
finals is accepted as tlie qualifying
distance, are today's trials of im
port. Should either of the two
Western colleges gain a definite
edge in the number of men quali
fied, the championship would be
;igood as won.
On a basis of possible points
Southern California must, be
rated favorites. Dean Crom
well's aces have it in their
power to collect as many as
40 or 45 precious digits, given
a fair share of the breaks. A
strictly logical prophecy as to
Stanford potentialities will not
allow the Cards more than
about 38 points.
On the other hand Stanford, with
the old reliables, Krenz and llotli
ert, plus Dyer and Dowell, can j
count not at least 25 certain points.
Troy's potentially stronger outfit
can be sure of only about eighteen
counts, secured through the ef
forts of W'ykoff, Hall, Mortenson,
Van Odsel, and their hurdles bat
talion.
In this writer's opinion, the
crux of the matter centers
about two events —the javelin
and broad jump.
Should I'aul and Barber repeat
their performances of the final
Cardinal-Trojan fracas when both
bettered U4 feet to relegate Dowell
to a third place, Southern Califor
nia can tack up nine points on the
scoring column, for the best East
ern marks of this year -fall short
of the 24-foot line. If, however, the
Trojan jumpers do no better than
1 hey did in the California- Intercol
legiat.es, they are extremely likely
to be shut out entirely.*
Stanford's famous rivals, the
California Bears, play a iead
ing part in the javelin situa
tion. In the California-Trojan
debacle early in the season
Snider of Southern California
nosed out Curtice and Church
ill with a neat toss of 197 feet
11 inches. Mortenson of the
* Trojans has thrown better than
200 feet. Thus if Curtice and
Churchill should neglect their
usual habit of pounding the
210-foot mark, Cromwell's crew
would collect another first and
second place. And eighteen
points garnered in the javelin
and broadjump would give the
Trojans an awfully good start
toward the championship.

night. And in the interim Stan
ford track enthusiasts will keep
their ears glued to the nearest
radio loudspeaker to catch
the latest tidings from the
Eastern front.
Jus( how the Cardinal anil Tro
jan representatives tare in today's
I rials may vv*• 11 decide (Iks issue
before llie final conflict. Particu
larly in the shot-put, discus, javelin
throw, and hroadjump, where llie
best mark made in either trials or
finals is accepted as tlie qualifying
distance, are today's trials of im
port. Should either of the two
Western colleges gain a definite
edge in the number of men quali
fied, the championship would be
;igood as won.
On a basis of possible points
Southern California must, be
rated favorites. Dean Crom
well's aces have it in their
power to collect as many as
40 or 45 precious digits, given
a fair share of the breaks. A
strictly logical prophecy as to
Stanford potentialities will not
allow the Cards more than
about 38 points.
On the other hand Stanford, with
the old reliables, Krenz and llotli
ert, plus Dyer and Dowell, can j
count not at least 25 certain points.
Troy's potentially stronger outfit
can be sure of only about eighteen
counts, secured through the ef
forts of W'ykoff, Hall, Mortenson,
Van Odsel, and their hurdles bat
talion.
In this writer's opinion, the
crux of the matter centers
about two events —the javelin
and broad jump.
Should I'aul and Barber repeat
their performances of the final
Cardinal-Trojan fracas when both
bettered U4 feet to relegate Dowell
to a third place, Southern Califor
nia can tack up nine points on the
scoring column, for the best East
ern marks of this year -fall short
of the 24-foot line. If, however, the
Trojan jumpers do no better than
1 hey did in the California- Intercol
legiat.es, they are extremely likely
to be shut out entirely.*
Stanford's famous rivals, the
California Bears, play a iead
ing part in the javelin situa
tion. In the California-Trojan
debacle early in the season
Snider of Southern California
nosed out Curtice and Church
ill with a neat toss of 197 feet
11 inches. Mortenson of the
* Trojans has thrown better than
200 feet. Thus if Curtice and
Churchill should neglect their
usual habit of pounding the
210-foot mark, Cromwell's crew
would collect another first and
second place. And eighteen
points garnered in the javelin
and broadjump would give the
Trojans an awfully good start
toward the championship.
