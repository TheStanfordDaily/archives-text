# THE 						CARDINAL COMET . . .
## Hec Dyer Meets Tolan and Wykoff in I.C.4-A. Sprints Today, Tomorrow; Card Is Marvelous Starter 
### Feg Murray, '16 
One of the high spots of the an
nual 1.C.4-A. games, to be held at
| Cambridge today and tomorrow,
I will be the two sprint races, featur
ing Frank Wykoff of Southern Cali
, fornia, Eddie Tolan of Michigan,
| and Hec Dyer of Stanford. Wykoff
| was national champion in 1928, but
| this is his first year in Eastern in
t tercollegiate competition. Tolan
likewise is competing in the 1.C.4-A.
for the first time, but he is an ex
perienced campaigner and won the
1!>29 Western Conference 100-yard
championship from George Simp
son in 9.5 and is the national cham
pion in both sprints. Hec Dyer
placed second in both sprints in
the intercollegiates at Philadelphia
last year as a sophomore, being
beaten by Wildemuth of George
i town in the hundred and Kent of
Colgate in the 220. Neither Wilder
ninth nor Kent will compete this
year, unless, I am badly mistaken.
Now what are young Mr. Dyer's
chances against the more famous
Wykoff and Tolan? He has not run
as fast as either lad in the "cen
tury," his best time being 9.6, while
Wykoff ran a 9.4 not so long ago.
But when Hec ran his 9.6 he beat
Wykoff a couple of yards (one yard,
so they say) was gained by a "roll
ing" start). However, on May 17,
"Flying Frank" reversed this deci
! sion, defeating the Stanford sprint
er at Palo Alto in 9.7. But Dyer tied
'Wykoff in the 220 in the Stanford-
U.S.C. meet on April 12 in 21.4,
land beat him at Palo Alto on May
'17 in 21.5. 1 doubt if either of the
Pacific Coast sprinters beats Tolan

,in the furlong at Cambridge on
: May 31.
i Hec Dyer should improve with I
| another-year of coaching under the
• Stanford wizard, Dink Templeton. j
Hec is the b£st. sprinter Stanford
has had since Morris Kirksey, one
time 1.C.4-A. champion, and second
in the 1!)20 Olympic Games 100-
j meter run. Dyer hasn't Kirksey's j
[ strength and power, hut lie has [
i splendid form, is a marvelous
\ starter, and thrives on eompeti
, lion. You can always count on him
doing just a little bit better than
J lie has any right to do.

J lie has any right to do.

One of the high spots of the an
nual 1.C.4-A. games, to be held at
| Cambridge today and tomorrow,
I will be the two sprint races, featur
ing Frank Wykoff of Southern Cali
, fornia, Eddie Tolan of Michigan,
| and Hec Dyer of Stanford. Wykoff
| was national champion in 1928, but
| this is his first year in Eastern in
t tercollegiate competition. Tolan
likewise is competing in the 1.C.4-A.
for the first time, but he is an ex
perienced campaigner and won the
1!>29 Western Conference 100-yard
championship from George Simp
son in 9.5 and is the national cham
pion in both sprints. Hec Dyer
placed second in both sprints in
the intercollegiates at Philadelphia
last year as a sophomore, being
beaten by Wildemuth of George
i town in the hundred and Kent of
Colgate in the 220. Neither Wilder
ninth nor Kent will compete this
year, unless, I am badly mistaken.
Now what are young Mr. Dyer's
chances against the more famous
Wykoff and Tolan? He has not run
as fast as either lad in the "cen
tury," his best time being 9.6, while
Wykoff ran a 9.4 not so long ago.
But when Hec ran his 9.6 he beat
Wykoff a couple of yards (one yard,
so they say) was gained by a "roll
ing" start). However, on May 17,
"Flying Frank" reversed this deci
! sion, defeating the Stanford sprint
er at Palo Alto in 9.7. But Dyer tied
'Wykoff in the 220 in the Stanford-
U.S.C. meet on April 12 in 21.4,
land beat him at Palo Alto on May
'17 in 21.5. 1 doubt if either of the
Pacific Coast sprinters beats Tolan

,in the furlong at Cambridge on
: May 31.
i Hec Dyer should improve with I
| another-year of coaching under the
• Stanford wizard, Dink Templeton. j
Hec is the b£st. sprinter Stanford
has had since Morris Kirksey, one
time 1.C.4-A. champion, and second
in the 1!)20 Olympic Games 100-
j meter run. Dyer hasn't Kirksey's j
[ strength and power, hut lie has [
i splendid form, is a marvelous
\ starter, and thrives on eompeti
, lion. You can always count on him
doing just a little bit better than
J lie has any right to do.
