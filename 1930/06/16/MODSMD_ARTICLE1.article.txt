seniors. In summing up the history
he said: "In short, these men and
women of 19110 were witnesses of
and participants in a great change
here on the Farm. There has been
the beginning of the slow and pain
ful death of 'collegiatism.' And
there has been the beginning of a
more suave, a calmer, a less bois
terous Stanford .... What do
these- things mean? Whither do
they lead?

in the drama; and with their bird's
eye view from the bottom of the
Stadium, they cannot see far

decease.
laves heart among us so completely
dead '<
That does not weep the head,
The head that in past days knew
all the best,
Knew Stanford as if was, ere cus
toms died,
lire passed the :;enioi hat from off
I lie quad.
Ere passed the dink from fresh
man's Wool y.crest,
Ere some malicious tradesman had
defied
The reign of cords with moleskin's
petty fraud;
Knew Stanford in the right of
mighty Daves."
Stanford Ideals Extolled
Following the Poem, George
ISodle, Class Orator, spoke of the
days of the members of 1930 at
Stanford, the tlinigs they had ac
quired, and looked into the future.
"It is svilli these new standards,
new concepts of which our ideals
are the summation, that Stanford
has dowered us for the life to
some, and in giving us these ideals,
lias, I believe, done the best pos
sible to prepare; us for happiness
in life. . . .
"And so as we go forth from
this chapel in two days more, and
scatter over the five continents
and the seven seas, let no man of
us in the years to come succumb
to the lure of gold, of ambition, of
fame, and in attaining these earth
ly ends, stifle the live within him."

and Oration had been given. Herb

soleum where the Flower Privilege
