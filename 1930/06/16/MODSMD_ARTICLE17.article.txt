### 
"Greetings to Hit! Class of *550
since you are now all members of
(he grea't Stanford familyâ€”the
alumni ;f family of over twenty
five thousand, hundreds of whom
can be found in every state of the
Union and lesser numbers in every
country of the world." Such is the
message of Stanford alumni trans
mitted to the graduating class
through John McDowell, '00, alumni
secretary.
"Congratulations because the
Class of '30 has surpassed all rec
ords of previous classes so far as
alumni membership is concerned,"
continues the communication. "At
graduation time, when even fifty
cent pieces are at a premium
among seniors, 7 am proud to an
nounce that already more than
sixty per cent of the class have
paid their alumni dues for the com
ing year .But I am even more proud
to announce that of this number
over ten per cent have paid life
memberships in the Alumni Asso
clat ion.
"During the past year we have
been conducting an active cam
paign for life memberships and
within the next few months will
launch another for a $1,000,000 en
dowment to be secured in life
memberships. It is indeed gratify
ing to have such an excellent re
sponse $2. r >oo, which will be the
corner-stone of this campaign
from our youngest group of alumni.
"Many of you are travelling many
miles from the Stanford Campus
and I want to stress the fact that
the Alumni office is your office. It
is .supported entirely by you and
exists only to give service and
keep you in touch with the Univer
sity, your classmates, and faculty
friends. The Illustrated Itoview at
tempts to accomplish the latter pur
pose, but we wish you to bear in
mind that this is your publication,
and if you have any criticism or
suggestion, write in and fell us.
"We who are left on the Quad
will miss the Class of "!0, hut we
know that as this class goes forth
there are five hundred new mem
bers of the Stanford 'family* who
will go into every corner of the
earth and no matter where fate
takes them, each as the years go
by, will be helping to strengthen
the place held by Stanford in the
world."
