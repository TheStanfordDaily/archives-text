# SWAIN SPEEDS GRADUATES TO NEW VICTORIES
## Acting President Terms Seniors "Ambassadors" To Courts of World Satisfaction in Service is Important Message in Commencement Address 
### 
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!

This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'

to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name

Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad

his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate

J fairly-bristles with questions which

"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of

ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be

speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.

mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.

of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I

Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober

Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
it"- their entrenched stronghold
nave yielded to the attack of thou
sands of workers in the fields of
biology and medicine and sanitary
J engineering; the impressive leap of
eleven years in Ihe expectancy of
life at birth, even though this is
due largely to the decrease in the
| mortality of infancy and youth; the
,4X1)0 published contributions in a
single field of science, chemistry,
iu the year of my graduation and
the 30,000 in yours, the amazing
(spread in the knowledge of radiant
[energy of controlled wave-lengths
j and its application in the radio, the
color film, the sound picture, and
i television; the transmission of elec
trical energy at voltages far be
yond the dreams of commercial ap
plication in my day; the use of the
; Roentgen ray in human therapy
and in a new attack on the mys
tery in which the living plant and
j animal cell is enshrouded.
In my day the geographical fron
tier brought fascination and a chal
lenge to the adventurer. In yours it
is the frontier of human knowledge
of another sort which is being
pushed forward into the continent
|of the unknown.
The old spirit of adventure, the
desire to know what lies beyond
I near-lying horizons, the daring ini
| pulse to explore in the realm of na
ture, is with us yet but it is taking
a new turn. Match if you can in the
I annals of human adventure the ex-
I citing search for the elusive vita
mins which affect so profoundly
the growth and reproduction and
| health of all living things. Where
! is there a tale of achievement and
j adventure It) equal the story of the
I discovery of insulin; that substance
of fascinating interest, which exer
cises such a marvelous influence
j over the sugar in the blood, and
which today .in skillful hands is
saving the lives of thousands of
victims of diabetes?
And it is not alone in science
1 1hat your day is witnessing great
I events. One need only refer to that
great adventure in human rights
which has been shifting its scene
from Versailles to Geneva and Lo
; earno and Washington and The
Hague and London. The whole
range of our interest litis widened
as the community life of the 'nine
j ties has swung away from its cen-
I ter so far that national boundaries
are forgotten as the products of
I factories and fields are pooled in
j the markets of the world and the
interchange of thought and senti
ment as well as of material re
sources encompasses the earth.
Emerson's lines have taken on a
broader significance in this day:
"For mankind are one in spirit,
And an instinct bears along
j Round the earth's electric circle
The swift flash of right and wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious,
J Yet humanity's vast frame
; Through its ocean-sundred fibers
I Feels the gush of joy or shame;
i In the gain or loss of one race,
All the rest have equal claim."
The other great movement which
has swept across these last three
decades, gathering momentum as it
advanced, has been that toward
i higher education. In 1890 there
| were 122,000 students in the col
lieges and universities of this coun
try. In 1910 this number had risen
to 170,000. Today there are over a
million. At the beginning of this
academic year nearly a half million
j new students enrolled in the insti
tutions of higher learning of Atner
! ica. In 1890 only \y z per cent of
the young men and women of col
■ lege age were in college. Now 12
per cent of them are. In 1890 only
j . r >y 2 per cent of the youth of high
school age were in the high school.
Now over fifty per cent of them
! are. It is true that the curve of
I registration for college work litis
been flattening in the larger insti
jtutions during the past two vears,
I but part of this is due to the de-
I velopment. of junior college and
| post-graduate high-school work.
This great movement is changing
j the course of education. The older
| disciplines no longer limit our
teaching, which is now co-extensive
j with life as it spreads out into new
fields for scholarly effort and pro
fessional service. In the social sci
ences it si touching from many
angles living problems in human
relationships; in biology and medi
cine it is providing training in
many new lues of service to the
community; in the physical sci
ences ii is touching from many
new forces a 1 the disposal of man;
end in literature and the arts it is
adding to the sources of our enjoy
ment and inspiration.
Education which does not ex
) press itself in contributing to hu
man happines and progress is stag
j nant. It lias lost its spirit
On the other hand many warn
ing voices are heard as one
I watches the impact of these two
i movements on the old order. In
private conv< rsation as well as in
i the current literature of the day
one meets the gloomy contention |
that this surge towards higher edu- j
cation Is developing a white-col- I
lared civilization without places !
enough to go around among the j
unhappy and disillusioned victims, i
But when we study the demand
which this new era is making upon j
the youth of this country and ob
serve the way in which college
men and women are meeting it,
this warning gives us little con
cern. What does concern us and |
the future of America is not their
number but the standards they j
represent; not their quantity hut
their quality; not how many of you
are there, but how well-endowed
are you.
The purpose of higher education
in America today is to develop
more men and women of greater
usefulness. It gives no assurance
of a life of luxury or leisure, and is
not intended to do so. It would fail
in its purpose if it did. It does seek '
to open the doors of opportunity j
and achievement to every one of i
you who are ready and willing to j
take full advantage of it. Mani
festly we are not training ditch
diggers nor hod-carriers. What we
are doing is to provide the train- j
ing and to instill the ambition to ;
get the ditch dug without using a j
pick and shovel to accomplish it,
lor to get the cement mixture to
j the to'p of the lofty concrete struc
ture without having someone to
carry it there on his back. We are
looking to you to put the test of
brains rather than brawn into the
tasks which tomorrow brings for
ward for you to perform.
This ne\v era is indicating in no
uncertain terms that an education
is one of the dominant factors in |
ia happy and successful career.'
I Even the farmer can no longer i
meet, intelligently the demands of
his vocation by being able to read j
the English language and make !
change. He has his intelligence put
to the test at every turn. He must
j know how to spot and eliminate
i from his dairy herd the poor pro
ducers, the relation of the ration
to milk production, the proper
treatment and fertilization of the
soil for specified crops, and the
ever-present and ever-changing
question of marketing what lie pro
duces. Every well-run farm now
J fairly-bristles with questions which
j can properly be met only by one
I who has been trained in the meth
j ods of getting and using the signiti
j cant information in his field.
Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.

Farming is no longer merely a
! scrap-basket occupation for the il
j literate. It is a vocation which is
j every year becoming more attrac
tive because it challenges, and let
| us hope it will in time suitably re*
! ward intelligent effort. Bring more
men into agriculture with this
training and capacity for leader
ship based upon a thorough under*
j standing of the facts bearing on
i any problem, and it will soon take
i its place among the great indus
! tries as aa inviting field in which
) to begin a successful career.
Thus all about us new social and
J economic forces are emerging in
j every phase of our national life. In
I meeting these you must be ready
| to play your part, to lead or direct
them through an understanding of
them or through ignorance to be
led or driven by them. You cannot
stand still. Take the motion pic
ture as an illustration. After twen
ty-five years of development and
growth the silent picture was
brought to a point where it began
to sense its power and influence
in education and understanding. It
was ready for expansion in many
directions when the sound picture
thrust itself to the center of the
stage, and the microphone, the
soundproof pavilion, and a multi
tude of serious problems took their
place in the changing scene. And
now comes the color film, and yon
der, upon its heels, television. And
with them all new opportunities for
trained minds to meet.
That white-collared invasion, if
I we must call it that, is the symbol
I and sinew of a new era and our
| hope for the future. The civiliza
! tion of today is built upon the wide
; spread program of higher educa
i ward trend in the level of prnduc
; tion which gave it birth. The np
tivity in Ibis country, in its stand-
J aids of living, in its economic effi
ciency, in its output of scholarly
' research, rests upon only one foun
dation — that is our educational
I program.
If it were not for education our
whole complex civilization would
j crumble in a single generation for
the sheer lack of men able to use
I the forces which are now placed so

generously ;it our command. This !
is not 'to sav that we arc perform
ing tlie task as well as we should.
Some arc gelling the wrong kind
of an education, and sonic arc get
ting altogether too little l'or the
time and energy spent upon ii both
by student and teacher. Hut we are
I not over-educating the youth of
I America, nor are we apt to do so
I in the future.
Another warning voice is heard
| to proclaim that we are not meas-
I uring up to the standards of the
I past in this new era in producing
men and women who are able and
I willing to become leaders. We are
I told that they are disinclined to
take responsibility, content to fol
j low the crowd. They think in terms
| of what they interpret as the drift
| of public sentiment on great ques
i tions instead of finding out for '
I themselves the facts of the present
I and the lessons of the past which
alone should be their guide. The
voice of the crowd, the tides of
sentiment in the masses of men
too often determine their course.
To this charge we can only reply
that if this be true, our hope lies
again in the young men and women
whom our colleagues and universi
ties have trained. It is to you that
we must look to carry forward into ,
the generation which is yours the
noblest and best in the history and
I ideals and the thought and spirit of
I America. This cannot be done care
lessly. It can only be done con
sciously. It must be based upon an
understanding of the past, a vision
of the future, and a sense of the
value of the individual in building
the structure of tomorrow.
We are not sending you forth to
conquer the world but to help build

new spiritual and intelelctual foun
dations for the generation which in j
turn will follow you. Tho masses j
of men catch the drifters, but not |
now any more than in the past can j
we afford to submerge the indi
vidual who refuses to drift. The !
human family is rapidly being more I
closely knit by the new means of
inter-communication and transpor
tation. The individual strands are
merged in a great human fabric in
which it is the larger pattern,
rather than the golden strands
which compose it, that catches our
attention. Hut never before in the
life of the race has il been so dan
gerous to trust to the sentiment of
the crowd the ideals and forces
which are shaping our destiny.
The pages of history are turning
faster now. Movements which
- swept across the history of the past
were glacial in their rate of prog
ress as compared with those of
today. Figuratively the aeroplane
has been substituted for the oxcart
in the movement of epoch-making
events. And in the same degree is
the challenge to the skill and char
. acter and spirits of the pilot
greater, the penalties of mistakes
'more disastrous. The genius of
America lias found its highest ex
pression in individual initiative and
enterprise. This was bred in the
lives of those, who carried the na
tion through Colonial days, given
tree rein as our geographical fron
tier spread through the last cen
tury westward to the Pacific, and
now in this new generation it is for
you, the men and women of our
universities, to preserve that price
less heritage of individual leader
ship and idealism.
I I\lay I leave with you two admo

nit ions. They apply alike lo nations
and to individuals. They are funda
mental elements in the develop- i
ment of both. They were brought '
out in significant and ringing
phrases recently in a remarkable i
address by Owen 1). Young. The 1
first as applied to nations, is that
no great nation can long stand
aloof from the rest of the world.
She must eventually raise the eco
nomic standard of other nations to
the level of her own, or be drawn |
to l lie economic level of the rest of j
the world. "America is too rich to j
be loved. She is well enough oil
to be envied. The attitude of the j
world toward her will be influenced i
largely by her spirit. If it can be
one of selfishness in isolation, she
will have failed in her great re
sponsibilities. If it be one of boast- j
fulness in her success, she will 1
have missed the tilings Clod lias j
given her.
Anil here is the other. During j
the life of many of you here today
under the terms of the Young Coin
niision, Germany is committed to!
tlie staggering burden of paying to
other nations sums approximaling j
nine billion dollars, or nearly $2<ini> |
for every man, woman, and child in j
the Republic. But the most of this,
huge sum is to be passed on to j
this country by other creditor na
tions in settlement of our war
loans. That looks good at the first :
balance. Hut one human attribute
looms large in the picture. Ger- j
many lias already turned resolutely I
to the task of meeting this great
obligation. She is back at work,
marshalling every resource in edu
| cation, and economics, and engi
-1 neering skill and science. It is not \
| at all improbable that she will )
| grow stronger rather than be weak
i ened through self-denial and work,
j And if on our part this great at:-|
\ cumulation of wealth should relieve j
us or just those things which are!
! fundamental to our success and i
I achievement as a nation work,
frugality, self-denial, the will and ,
j the purpose to do so we could j
■ easily become a tragic loser in this
great transaction. Weigh carefully
I that suggestion.
From one of these we learn the
; lesson of service, and from the
J other tlie lesson of work. You will
j never tap fully the fountain of hu
; man happiness until you have
j tackled some big task and unsel
! fishly seen it through. And there
is no more enduring satisfaction
i lban that which comes from the
j consciousness of having done well
I some great task which it lias come
! to your hands It) do.
i You stand here today at. the
threshold of over a thousand indi
vidual careers. It not been long,
i as time goes, since the daybreak
of early childhood and the dawn of
j school and college days. But now
j it is sunrise! There is a great day's
j work ahead for all of you —clear
i skies, the warmth of fine friend

[ships, llif strength of being ready
I lor its tests, the joy <»t' lacing its
I marvellous opportunities. It i: not
long between the purple glow of
i dawn, the splendor of noontime,
and the crimson and sold of the
sunset of life, liut this is your day,
ho make of it what you will, lly
■ such as you will its place in history
i hi' determined. From such as you
I will its leaders come. Through
; such as you will the spirit and
\ power of our day be carried over
j into yours.
You now become a part of that
greater Stanford which lives in I lie
I hearts and minds of men all over
the earth engineers, diplomats,
I men of affairs and business, inter
j prefers of the law, scientists, teach
! ers -who have taken with them
| something of the spirit and inspira
i tion of this I'niversity.
You are our representatives in
' tin; work of the world. We bid you
i Godspeed!
