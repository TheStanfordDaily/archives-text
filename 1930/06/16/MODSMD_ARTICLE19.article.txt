## Acting President Terms Seniors "Ambassadors" To Courts of World Satisfaction in Service is Important Message in Commencement Address 
### 
Addressing the members of the
Class of lfiyo as "ambassadors"
who will carry the Stanford name
to courts of their own choosing,
Dr. Robert E. Swain .acting presi
dent, in his Commencement Ad
dress this morning pictured the
world into which they will go, in
terpreting the significance of this
"new era," the spirit and achieve
j uients of research, the movement
| toward internationalism and high
or education, the new social and
I economic forces.
Through a quotation from a
speech of Owen I). Young in which
he spoke against a spirit of "sel
fishness in isolation" and "boast
fulness in success" and for "sober
and sensible responsibility," Dr.
Swain pointed out the lesson of
service. The lesson of hard work
j he explained by the illustration of
j Germany's staggering burden of
j paying its indemnity, her resolute
j turning toward this task, and the
I probable growth of strength of
Germany as a result, and at the.
| same time the possible weakening
; of the morale of the United State
through the accumulation of
wealth. With these two admoni
(ions and the picturing of com
mencement as the sunrise of life.
Dr. Swain closed his speech.
Following is the text of the Com
mencement Address:
An Outlook
In the absence of President Wil
| bur it has fallen to me to give you
a parting message before you take
leave of this place where for a time
we have worked together. The first
impulse was to make this the oc
casion for the development of some
topic of academic interest, but tlii
was quickly overshadowed by the
thought that : iay n is not science,
nor vihuw.'-a. nor vurrent . vent:
which si r* >• n our minds. It
ii< you -the era.hiac- s of 1 !(30 -
what >' i -tan : 1 « i: you are.
what you aiv to be, thai makes
this day »n»i. memorable.
There have l>» »-n only thirty
thirty-eight days like it in all the
history of Stanford. There will be
| few days more important in the
life of each one of you. There will
be none more important in the life
of the University, for it is through
you that the purpose of Stanford
is achieved and its spirit made to
endure, if there is here a'spiritual
background of devotion to tit"
( finest ideals of education and ser
vice, it can find expression only in
you. In a very real sense you ape
our ambassadors but the court: to
'which you will carry the Stanford
name are of your own choosing.
We arc sending you forth to phi >
your part in one of the great
periods of human history. This
i new era began to take shape dur
1 inn my own college days, but ii
has risen lo particular prominence
in yours. Two great development.,
have been dominant in it and pn
: marily responsible for if. Neither
one of these can survive or flourish
without the other. One of these ha
been the amazing increase in tie
fund of human knowledge, whfch
scholarly research in every field of
human endeavor has placed at tb<
disposal of man. Men now living
can recall among the development
I of their lifetime a record of prop
less in many fields which it would
take the span of two or three prr
(ceding centuries to duplicate.
Compare the horsedrawn vehicle
or the bicycle as a means of trans
portation at the disposal of the
individual in my college days with
the automobile and the aeroplane
of yours; (he single horsepower of
available mechanical energy p t
capita of the 'nineties and the ii l
of today; the concerted attack In
these last three decades upon the
great human scourges typhoid,
j scurvy, diphtheria, diabetes, scarlet
fever, beri-heri typhus as one by
