# ILLUSION'S

\i noon today nearly eight Imi id red men and women will bid
farewell to one of the foremost periods of their careers —the life
of undergraduates in ;t great I Diversity. Many of them, as they
tuck away llieir sheepskins in their voluminous academic gowns,
will have au undeniable feeling of Tftss. Main will realize thai they
arc four years closer to the goal lliev have set for themselves.
Others will take their scrolls as thev niuller under their breath —
" I hank < iod !
True, not all of iliem will take their last look at Stanford today.
\I any will he hack in ( )ctober, eager to continue the work in which
graduation is but :i mere resting place. Hut of all those who today
become "college graduates," a mere handful will continue their
work for the I diversity.
I hose who register again this fall will no longer have the con
•truclive enthusiasm 1 <«i the growth of their \lnia Mater. Then,
ihe\ will he stiulying lor themselves alone. \ll<l those who say
farewell to the I iiiversil\ will find great barriers of economv and
time il they should care to help once again the college in which they
reached maturity.
It is to the classes behind them, then, the senior classes that are
ye! to be. that the graduates must look to carry on. The dreams
that today's seniors have cherished, the plans that they have built
for Stanford's greatness —these the Class of 1930 must pass on to
the coming generations of Stanford men and women. And il will
be these classes that will determine the fate of the dreams of today.
Illusions. I Mans for tomorrow, hopes for greater glory. That
i* all that the graduating class can give to its successors. And let
no dishonor fall on the shoulders of the graduates, for the dreams
are necessary—they are the first step in a progress that is as uncer
tain as the lilc into which the seniors will enter tomorrow.

Stanford todav is a ereat universitv. Il is a voting university,
though, and its growth is that of ;i young animal —sudden, awk
ward. uncertain. Hut the growth is evident, and so long as it con
tinues. Stanford will remain eternally young. Today, however, the
I'niversity facts a crisis in its existence. Its financial structure is
dangerously weak. I hit what may be the source of even more dan
•fer are its traditions.
Traditions may supply the, color to Stanford, but thev may
equally well stille the energy, the enthusiasm, the desire for im
provement that makes Stanford the great college that it is. I he\
may force Stanford into the old rut —"It has always been right be
fore. therefore it must be right today."
.Nearly tort\ years ago. the founders laid plans for a college that
in its time was an ideal educational institution. Hut todav, under
the light ot modern conditions, there ma\ be wise changes that are
necessary. More accommodations for women are needed in order
that equal opportunities ma\ be accorded men and women. This
demand must soon be tilled.
The baccalaureate and commencement ceremonies that have just
been concluded point out undeniably that the Memorial Church,
beautiful as it is, has outlived its usefulness as a scene for these
activities, when in it must be crowded those who have come to he
present.
I oday comes news of a revised system of regulations for Stati
on d women. I ndoubtedly it is a large step forward towards their
complete emancipation. I hit tomorrow the very women who pro
posed the new rulings will chafe under its severity.
In this, their last undergraduate year, the seniors have watched
with more sorrow than ever before the growing chasm between
student and professor. ,\'o longer are there the stimulating semin
ars. the round tables, the inspiring bullsessioiis. Members of the
family, no matter how them ma\ be inclined, attend these meetings
to teach—not to talk. And the students, if they attend at all. are
there to get notes, and not ideas.
I he hall row battle, the ceaseless bickering between fratcr
nit\ and non-fraternity men, has always been a thorn iu the side of
not only the \dminislration, but of the students as well. Matters of
polic\ are decided todav. not on how the individual thinks, but on
how he a* a fraternity or non-fraternity man must think.
Money, of course, is a prime need here—money to build more
dormitories, to break down artificial social segregation that is as
unpleasant to those inside the walls as it is to those outside.
And the other thorn, pressing on the other side, pressing just as
painfully, is that of intellectual segregation. I lie honorary soci
eties. the professional fraternities —scores of them exist as para
sites. parading under names that do not even partially describe
them. I heir members are chosen occasionally on their merits, but
usually on the number of friends which they can claim in the or
ganization. Hut no matter how their members be selected, thev are
for the most part empty names. 'They claim to have on their rolls
the names of the most brilliant, the most energetic, the most capable
students on the campus, but out of this assemblage of brain and
muscle comes nothing. That organization, labeled with a Creek
name, which professes to be a drinking society, is at least honest.
It floes what it claims to do. even if its activities do not require brain
matter for their performance.
* ?!'. *
Such are of the dreams of the graduates. These, with count
1< • s others, form one more part of the intangible heritage that the
graduates pass on.
I >reanis they may be, but of what are they made? Are they
vague. hazy plans that need onlv the ambition and energy of the
oncoming generations to bring to a concrete development? < >t' are
I lie \ illusions dreams that can never come true?
To the senior classes of tomorrow the Class of I'UO gives its
plans for the Inline, and with the plate, its wish of (iod speed for
theit* realization.
