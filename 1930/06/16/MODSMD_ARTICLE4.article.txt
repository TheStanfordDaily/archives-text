# CARRY BANNERS ALOFT--WILBUR
## Dr. Swain Reads Secretary Of Interior's Message 
### 
After his Commencement Ad
dross this morning, Acting-Presi
dent Robert E. Swain read the fol
lowing message from President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, who, although
he hoped to be present at the Com
mencement ceremonies, was de
tained in Washington by legislative
work:
"Until the legislative jam caught
some measures of immediate con
cern to the Department of the In
terior, I bad hoped to be on hand
I to join with Acting-President Swain
and the Faculty in seeing that you
were properly enrolled among the
graduates of Stanford. It was a
pleasure to welcome you when you
first, came and as you come back
to the campus it will always be a
pleasure to see you again.
"A short period out of the circle
of the niversity has brought to me
more clearly than before the mean
ing of such a day as this. Our for
ward march as a people depends
upon the proper use by men and
women of the available resources
which they can individually com
mand. There is no other resource
comparable to a trained and expert
mind, guided by an active con
science, inspired by ideals, and
dwelling in a body vigorous with
the physical forces of health. To
you lias come the chance to live in
a University in a, fellowship of
young and mature scholars, li can
not have failed to aid you. It must
not fail to stimulate you to go on
and on in self-improvement, so that
you can do more and more for the
rest of us. If you think your educa
tion is finished you are finished.
"New information, new ideas,
new methods, new concepts are ap
pea ring as never before. There is
now a world-wide sweep to our
race. The human family sees this
globe of ours and sees itself with
eyes illumined, and with minds
alert to a myriad of facts set in
order by science and used in every
day civilization.
"To each of us is given the con
trol of an amount of power in vari
ous forms which compared to a
century ago makes us supermen in
deed. Power requires control. Con
tro lrequires knowledge. Knowl
edge requires study. Wise use of
power demands the expert.. To
make you expert in the use of your
rwn mind and body is the reason
for your education. If you are ex
pert in handling yourself you will
be called upon to rlo expert services
for others. Through the mass of
such services is built up our pres
ent form of society.
"My principal suggestion to you
is to be patient with your neighbor
and with the forces stirring in the
hearts and souls of men. It takes
time 'to soothe the savage breast'
and we are all part savage under
our silks and woolens. We want so
much; freedom, prosperity, health,
happiness, peace, brotherly love,
and yet for each there is a heavy
price to pay and others must go
along with us.
"Each of us can contribute some
thing toward a better future, but it
cannot be done by fault-finding,
complaining, or interfereing with
those who work ahead. We need no
more back-seat drivers. Nature's
mistakes provide enough of them.
There is room on the front seat for
every one of you.
