The natural springiness of
the step is stimulated liy
the moulded Arch Preserver
metatarsal support.
Nerves, muscles and blood
vessels enjoy barefoot free

The long arch retains its
youthful strength and buoy
ancy, all strain and stress
being absorbed by the con
cealed Arch Preserver arch
bridge.
No other shoe has these
patented features. We have
your size in many distin
guished < 'ustom (iradt* styles
at 812.50 up..Other grades

To the man who wants an $8.50
