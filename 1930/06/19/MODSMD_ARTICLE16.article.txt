# After All, It's Summer

Stanford's student body for the summer quarter is registering today.
Most of us are very much in earnest about our work for the next ten
weeksâ€”more earnest, nti the whole probably, than students of the other
quarters usually are. And summer on the Stanford campus makes it
easy rather than hard to carry on solid work.
Hut after all il is summer, and summer is a normal time for recrea
tion. Those who can. take vacations ai this time of the year quite naturally
and normally, for il is the regular time to seek recreation.
Hut there is nothing to prevent getting recreation without taking a
vacation in the sense of doing nothing at all. The two essentials of real
physical recreation are bodily exercise of some degree of vigor and enjoy
ment in thai exercise. It is not essential that nothing at all serious be
done in order to gain recreation. (iood physical recreation produces also
mental and spiritual recreation.
So why not seek recreation and a genuine "vacation" while still work
ing hard in classes and library and laboratory?
Stanford affords plenty of opportunity for enjoyable and pro fit aide
recreation during the summer. To list some of them:
The new golf course. This is acclaimed one of the.most interesting as
well as one of the most beautiful in the country. The cost to Stanford
people is much less than that to the hundreds of others who eagerly seek
its greens and fairways.
The swimming pools. It may be a good thing to register for regular
classes in order to have that compulsion to take regular exercise, but the
pools as well as the other facilities of the gymnasiums are open to all
students whether they are registered in gym classes'or not. Swimming
i< a fine thing during the summer.
Tennis. The courts are always popular. Later there will doubtless
be intramural tournaments to add /est to participation in this healthful and
interesting" sport.
Horseback riding, (iood horses can be hired at any of several places
in the neighborhood, and il is not necessarv to go several miles to reach
pleasant roads and bridle paths. Within live minutes from the Ottad
riders are in the midst of rolling foothills, with refreshing views on.
every side near at hand and in the distance.
floating and swimming. At Searsville lake, only a brief distance away
on the campus, is this attractive lake with its equipment for boating,
swimming, and picnicking.
I liking. Xo equipment is needed for hiking into the hills in any
direction, and in any direction.hundreds of pleasant objectives lie before
those who follow this most healthful of exercises.
Week-end excursions. Provision is made for enjoyable and in
structive trips every Saturday to nearby points of beauty and interest.
A really good "course" for the summer, even though it gives no credit
in the Registrar's ollice would be participation in all these week-end
excursions and the first-hand knowledge to be gained thereby of won
derful forests, mountains, sky, and stars, and of a citv famed throughout
tlie world for its individual spirit and charm.
