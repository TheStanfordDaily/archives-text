'I lie Stani ord Daily welcomes letters from the Stanford people who
are its rentiers concerning matters that touch Stanford ami its people.
It delights to l>e useful in providing a forum for the discussion of things
that hear on Stanford interests.
Feel tree to send in your letters for publication, that other Stanford
people may read them and it they choose voice their own opinions on
ihe same subjects. The editors pledge themselves to give space to everv
communication that seems likely l<> be interesting. The editors of course
must reserve the right to decline to print any letters that in their judg
ment are clearly not useful, but d<i not expect to need to exercise that
duty.
Certainly the letters do not need to agree with opinions held bv the
I) mi v. < >n the contrary, the Daily will most eagerly print communica
tions which disagree with its own—that is one of the most valuable
attributes of such letters. It is not even necessary that the stand taken
in a letter shall conform lo the. majority opinion of the campus: one of
the chief values of such letters is the opportunity for the majority to
hear a minority l opinion.
Naturally, all letters must be signed; anonymous contributions can
recieve no attention whatever. The Daii.v does not insist, however, that
authors' names must be signed to the printed letters, although it mildly
prefers it that way. I hat is a malter for the writers' choice.
Hnally, may it be suggested that not the only, or even the best use
of a contributors' column is fault-finding. Fault-finding is fairly easy,
hut mere fault-finding doesn't do very much good. There are doubtless
many faults in things on the campus, but certainly there are many things
to be cheerful about. If you have complaints that you must air. why
send em in, but at the same time it you feel like giving ;i word of praise
now and then, you may add to the sum of general happiness on the
rumpus during t bright summer season.
