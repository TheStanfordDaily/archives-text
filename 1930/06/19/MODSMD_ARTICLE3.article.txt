### 
yOU have come hern with ;i definite program'of study, lor which all the
availuble resources of Stanford are at your disposal. In addition lo carrying
through the work you plan, you have an opportunity to derive many benefits
outside of your immediate field. There is much of interest on the Stanford
campus, and it is worth while to know the University of which you are a part.
You will have the chance this summer to broaden your interests in many
directions. On the summer faculty are distinguished scholars and teachers
from other universities of the United States and Europe, in addition to those
members of the regular staff who have

remained on duty.
Cultural Opportunities Offered
Several series of lectures of unusual
cultural interest have been arranged.
Mr. Olin Downes, music critic on tlu:
New York Times, comes to Stanford
to deliver a series on musical topics.
For students of the modern lan
guages there will be lectures in
French, Spanish, and German by not
able native scholars. A French and
Spanish dining room, establiished in
the Stanford Union, makes it possible
to gain facility in speaking these lan
guages under the direction of compe
tent, hostesses representing France
and Spain.
In addition to the summer program
provided at the University, students
may hear rarely good music on Sun
day afternoons in the beautiful open
air Woodland theatre at Hillsborough.
The Philharmonic Society of San
Mateo County has arranged a series
of concerts to be given by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra under
distinguished guest conductors. Spe
cial student tickets are offered at a
very low price, and the Woodland
theatre is easily accessible.
Fellowship Is Fostered
Those of you who have come to this
region of California for the first time
will be glad to avail yourselves of the
week-end automobile excursions to
the principal nearby points of interest.
As Stanford is a residence univer
sity, with a student body of moderate
numbers during the summer quarter,
there is an unique opportunity to en
joy the community life of this campus.
Frequent occasions are provided

throughout the summer to meet l'ellow
.students and members of the faculty.
If you are a newcomer, it is hoped
that, you will soon feel that there is a
real spirit of welcome, both from mem
bers of the faculty and those students
who have been here previously.
We wish you all —new students,
those who are with us again for their
second or third summer, and those
who are remaining on from the spring
quarter —a successful and pleasant
summer at Stanford.
— John A. Sellards.


DEAN JOHN A. SELLARDS
