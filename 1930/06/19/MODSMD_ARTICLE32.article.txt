# STANFORD UNIVERSITY MUSEUM OUTGROWTH Of YOUNG LELAND'S DESIRE TO AID PUBLIC
## 
### 
The Stanford Museum is an out
growth of a boyish interest. When
Loland Stanford, Jr., was eight years
old his father gave him a little cabinet
in which he put collections he had
made. These included primarily fossils
and natural history material, such as
wasps' nests, birds' eggs, and petrified
wood.
A few years later the Stanfords
went to Europe and the son continued
his collecting. It was on his return
to California when lie was thirteen
years old that the idea of some day
establishing a public museum in his
own city of San Francisco seems to
have taken more definite form. A
second trip to Europe was undertaken
some two years later. During this visit
the youth became infected with the
virus of Roman fever from which lie
never recovered.
When Senator and Mrs. Stanford
finally concluded to found a Univer
sity In memory of their son, it seemed
particularly appropriate to establish
a museum as a personal memorial.
Two rooms in the institution are given
over to those collections made by he
land, Jr., before lie was sixteen years
old.
First Reinforced Concrete Building
As soon as preliminary plans had
been worked out for the establishment
of the University and the inner quad
rangle was built, Senator Stanford
turned his attention to the museum.
Housed in the first reinforced concrete
building erected in the country, it at
once became a structure of great in
terest.
Friends of Senator Stanford at
tempted to dissuade him from the idea
of a building constructed of iron and
cement but this type of construction
appealed to him, so the work went
ahead. When the building was started
he would come down to Palo Alto
regularly to see that the cement was
properly mixed and that the reinforc
ing was done as he would have it.
This new type of building was put
to a test by the earthquake of l'Jo(>.
It is said to have stood the strain
better than any other structure here
about. Marble used in the interior was
quarried in Amador county, California,
and is all hand-carved.
Oriental Antiques Are Valuable
After Senator Stanford's death, Mrs.
Stanford traveled extensively to col
lect material for the museum which
her son had begun. She visited Egypt,
traveled throughout Asia Minor, went
to Japan, and searched all over Eu
rope.
Prominent among the collections is
one of Oriental antiques from China
and Japan, made by a collector of the
name of Ikeda. This Jkeda group was
purchased intact by Mrs. Stanford
from the widow of the collector. Other
Oriental material of great value was
donated by Timothy Hopkins, an as
sociate of Senator Stanford, and the
last of the original group of the Board
of Trustees.
I here is an Egyptian collection,
gotten together for Mrs. Stanford by
Emil Drusch Bey, curator of the mu
seum of Cairo. It has been evaluated
by the Egyptologist Sayse as being
very good original material.
Early California history is depicted
in one room. A large part of the space
Is occupied by the first railroad loco
motive to steam into California, the
"Governor Stanford No. 1." The en
gine's capacious maw suggests that it
is a wood burner—at one time called
"hay burner," according to Mr. Lemos,
because the sparks which hew from its
smoke stack frequently set fire to the
fall grass as the engine puffed its way
across the plains. Finally an ingenious
mechanic provided an Inverted funnel
with a screen across the exhaust pipe
and removed this fire hazard.

Family Effects in Memorial Room
A memorial room on the second
floor of the museum contains a great
many family effects, together willi
articles associated with the life of
the founders and the early history of
the University. Articles pertaining to
the completion of the first transcon
tinental railroad may he seen in one
case. This road was the Central Pa
cific, of which Senator Stanford was
president. It was later merged witii
the Southern Pacific. The famous last
spike driven in the building of the
road, and the hammer with which
Senator Stanford drove it, are there.
Twenty-three double eagles were used
in the casting of this golden spike
and on it is inscribed the date "May
13, 1869." However, because of delays
which frequently could not he fore
seen in the pioneer days of railroad
building, the spike was driven a few
days later.
The twenty-dollar gold pieces out of
which the spike was cast were taken
by David Hewes, a brother-in-law of
Mrs. Stanford, to a San Francisco
goldsmith, and I lie finished spike was
sent, by this man to Promontory, Utah,
near Ogden, where the Central Pacific
line ended.
In the family room is a collection
of toys with which young Iceland Stan
ford played and a number of drawings
made by him. These drawings show
in detail the rigging of a great variety
of sea-going vessels. Some of the boy's
wood carvings which are shown here
won distinction at tin* California State
Fair. This room also contains a case
of material collected by the family of
President Ulysses S. Grant, who was
a friend of tiie Stanfords. A uniform
which General Grant wore during the
Civil War may be seen.
Check Written by George Washington
A check written and signed by
I George Washington may be seen in a
room which holds a collection of early
American and colonial material. There
is also a musket which was used in
the Revolutionary War. Laces col
lected by Mrs. Stanford and textiles
from many countries make up a col
lection in still another room.
In a larger room there is a miscel
laneous display of museum articles
from different parts of the world. How
ever, a great part of the space in this
room is being arranged for a display
of European crafts and articles de
picting the life of North American
Indians.
j Fossils make up an interesting part
I of the museum displays. A large col
i lection has been turned over to the
! institution by Dr. David Starr Jordan,
I first president of the University.
: There are also a group of restoration
| drawings of fossils showing how lisli
! looked when they were alive at a
period which scientists believe was
■more than a million years ago.
Skeleton of Great Auk Valuable
A collection of natural history and
j biological material furnished from the
zoological department of the Univer
sity completely fills the large balcony
! in the center of the building. The col
lection consists largely of sea life
species, including crabs, star fish, and
a variety of specimens from the sea
gardens. There is an extensive col
lection of California bird life.
The skeleton of a Great Auk, a bird
| which has been extinct for some sev
enty years, is looked upon as one of
the most precious of the pieces in the
i museum. Although it had well de
veloped wing bones, the Great Auk
was unable to fly. "This was perhaps
i because of its great weight," says Mr.
Lciuos. It stands nearly two feet, in
j height.

Twenty-three double eagles were used
in the casting of this golden spike
and on it is inscribed the date "May
13, 1869." However, because of delays
which frequently could not he fore
seen in the pioneer days of railroad
building, the spike was driven a few
days later.
The twenty-dollar gold pieces out of
which the spike was cast were taken
by David Hewes, a brother-in-law of
Mrs. Stanford, to a San Francisco
goldsmith, and I lie finished spike was
sent, by this man to Promontory, Utah,
near Ogden, where the Central Pacific
line ended.
In the family room is a collection
of toys with which young Iceland Stan
ford played and a number of drawings
made by him. These drawings show
in detail the rigging of a great variety
of sea-going vessels. Some of the boy's
wood carvings which are shown here
won distinction at tin* California State
Fair. This room also contains a case
of material collected by the family of
President Ulysses S. Grant, who was
a friend of tiie Stanfords. A uniform
which General Grant wore during the
Civil War may be seen.
Check Written by George Washington
A check written and signed by
I George Washington may be seen in a
room which holds a collection of early
American and colonial material. There
is also a musket which was used in
the Revolutionary War. Laces col
lected by Mrs. Stanford and textiles
from many countries make up a col
lection in still another room.
In a larger room there is a miscel
laneous display of museum articles
from different parts of the world. How
ever, a great part of the space in this
room is being arranged for a display
of European crafts and articles de
picting the life of North American
Indians.
j Fossils make up an interesting part
I of the museum displays. A large col
i lection has been turned over to the
! institution by Dr. David Starr Jordan,
I first president of the University.
: There are also a group of restoration
| drawings of fossils showing how lisli
! looked when they were alive at a
period which scientists believe was
■more than a million years ago.
Skeleton of Great Auk Valuable
A collection of natural history and
j biological material furnished from the
zoological department of the Univer
sity completely fills the large balcony
! in the center of the building. The col
lection consists largely of sea life
species, including crabs, star fish, and
a variety of specimens from the sea
gardens. There is an extensive col
lection of California bird life.
The skeleton of a Great Auk, a bird
| which has been extinct for some sev
enty years, is looked upon as one of
the most precious of the pieces in the
i museum. Although it had well de
veloped wing bones, the Great Auk
was unable to fly. "This was perhaps
i because of its great weight," says Mr.
Lciuos. It stands nearly two feet, in
j height.
The Stanford Museum is an out
growth of a boyish interest. When
Loland Stanford, Jr., was eight years
old his father gave him a little cabinet
in which he put collections he had
made. These included primarily fossils
and natural history material, such as
wasps' nests, birds' eggs, and petrified
wood.
A few years later the Stanfords
went to Europe and the son continued
his collecting. It was on his return
to California when lie was thirteen
years old that the idea of some day
establishing a public museum in his
own city of San Francisco seems to
have taken more definite form. A
second trip to Europe was undertaken
some two years later. During this visit
the youth became infected with the
virus of Roman fever from which lie
never recovered.
When Senator and Mrs. Stanford
finally concluded to found a Univer
sity In memory of their son, it seemed
particularly appropriate to establish
a museum as a personal memorial.
Two rooms in the institution are given
over to those collections made by he
land, Jr., before lie was sixteen years
old.
First Reinforced Concrete Building
As soon as preliminary plans had
been worked out for the establishment
of the University and the inner quad
rangle was built, Senator Stanford
turned his attention to the museum.
Housed in the first reinforced concrete
building erected in the country, it at
once became a structure of great in
terest.
Friends of Senator Stanford at
tempted to dissuade him from the idea
of a building constructed of iron and
cement but this type of construction
appealed to him, so the work went
ahead. When the building was started
he would come down to Palo Alto
regularly to see that the cement was
properly mixed and that the reinforc
ing was done as he would have it.
This new type of building was put
to a test by the earthquake of l'Jo(>.
It is said to have stood the strain
better than any other structure here
about. Marble used in the interior was
quarried in Amador county, California,
and is all hand-carved.
Oriental Antiques Are Valuable
After Senator Stanford's death, Mrs.
Stanford traveled extensively to col
lect material for the museum which
her son had begun. She visited Egypt,
traveled throughout Asia Minor, went
to Japan, and searched all over Eu
rope.
Prominent among the collections is
one of Oriental antiques from China
and Japan, made by a collector of the
name of Ikeda. This Jkeda group was
purchased intact by Mrs. Stanford
from the widow of the collector. Other
Oriental material of great value was
donated by Timothy Hopkins, an as
sociate of Senator Stanford, and the
last of the original group of the Board
of Trustees.
I here is an Egyptian collection,
gotten together for Mrs. Stanford by
Emil Drusch Bey, curator of the mu
seum of Cairo. It has been evaluated
by the Egyptologist Sayse as being
very good original material.
Early California history is depicted
in one room. A large part of the space
Is occupied by the first railroad loco
motive to steam into California, the
"Governor Stanford No. 1." The en
gine's capacious maw suggests that it
is a wood burner—at one time called
"hay burner," according to Mr. Lemos,
because the sparks which hew from its
smoke stack frequently set fire to the
fall grass as the engine puffed its way
across the plains. Finally an ingenious
mechanic provided an Inverted funnel
with a screen across the exhaust pipe
and removed this fire hazard.

Family Effects in Memorial Room
A memorial room on the second
floor of the museum contains a great
many family effects, together willi
articles associated with the life of
the founders and the early history of
the University. Articles pertaining to
the completion of the first transcon
tinental railroad may he seen in one
case. This road was the Central Pa
cific, of which Senator Stanford was
president. It was later merged witii
the Southern Pacific. The famous last
spike driven in the building of the
road, and the hammer with which
Senator Stanford drove it, are there.

been worked out for the establishment
of the University and the inner quad
rangle was built, Senator Stanford
turned his attention to the museum.
Housed in the first reinforced concrete
building erected in the country, it at
once became a structure of great in
terest.
Friends of Senator Stanford at
tempted to dissuade him from the idea
of a building constructed of iron and
cement but this type of construction
appealed to him, so the work went
ahead. When the building was started
he would come down to Palo Alto
regularly to see that the cement was
properly mixed and that the reinforc
ing was done as he would have it.
This new type of building was put
to a test by the earthquake of l'Jo(>.
It is said to have stood the strain
better than any other structure here
about. Marble used in the interior was
quarried in Amador county, California,
and is all hand-carved.
Oriental Antiques Are Valuable
After Senator Stanford's death, Mrs.
Stanford traveled extensively to col
lect material for the museum which
her son had begun. She visited Egypt,
traveled throughout Asia Minor, went
to Japan, and searched all over Eu
rope.
Prominent among the collections is
one of Oriental antiques from China
and Japan, made by a collector of the
name of Ikeda. This Jkeda group was
purchased intact by Mrs. Stanford
from the widow of the collector. Other
Oriental material of great value was
donated by Timothy Hopkins, an as
sociate of Senator Stanford, and the
last of the original group of the Board
of Trustees.
I here is an Egyptian collection,
gotten together for Mrs. Stanford by
Emil Drusch Bey, curator of the mu
seum of Cairo. It has been evaluated
by the Egyptologist Sayse as being
very good original material.
Early California history is depicted
in one room. A large part of the space
Is occupied by the first railroad loco
motive to steam into California, the
"Governor Stanford No. 1." The en
gine's capacious maw suggests that it
is a wood burner—at one time called
"hay burner," according to Mr. Lemos,
because the sparks which hew from its
smoke stack frequently set fire to the
fall grass as the engine puffed its way
across the plains. Finally an ingenious
mechanic provided an Inverted funnel
with a screen across the exhaust pipe
and removed this fire hazard.

Family Effects in Memorial Room
A memorial room on the second
floor of the museum contains a great
many family effects, together willi
articles associated with the life of
the founders and the early history of
the University. Articles pertaining to
the completion of the first transcon
tinental railroad may he seen in one
case. This road was the Central Pa
cific, of which Senator Stanford was
president. It was later merged witii
the Southern Pacific. The famous last
spike driven in the building of the
road, and the hammer with which
Senator Stanford drove it, are there.
Twenty-three double eagles were used
in the casting of this golden spike
and on it is inscribed the date "May
13, 1869." However, because of delays
which frequently could not he fore
seen in the pioneer days of railroad
building, the spike was driven a few
days later.
The twenty-dollar gold pieces out of
which the spike was cast were taken
by David Hewes, a brother-in-law of
Mrs. Stanford, to a San Francisco
goldsmith, and I lie finished spike was
sent, by this man to Promontory, Utah,
near Ogden, where the Central Pacific
line ended.
In the family room is a collection
of toys with which young Iceland Stan
ford played and a number of drawings
made by him. These drawings show
in detail the rigging of a great variety
of sea-going vessels. Some of the boy's
wood carvings which are shown here
won distinction at tin* California State
Fair. This room also contains a case
of material collected by the family of
President Ulysses S. Grant, who was
a friend of tiie Stanfords. A uniform
which General Grant wore during the
Civil War may be seen.
Check Written by George Washington
A check written and signed by
I George Washington may be seen in a
room which holds a collection of early
American and colonial material. There
is also a musket which was used in
the Revolutionary War. Laces col
lected by Mrs. Stanford and textiles
from many countries make up a col
lection in still another room.
In a larger room there is a miscel
laneous display of museum articles
from different parts of the world. How
ever, a great part of the space in this
room is being arranged for a display
of European crafts and articles de
picting the life of North American
Indians.
j Fossils make up an interesting part
I of the museum displays. A large col
i lection has been turned over to the
! institution by Dr. David Starr Jordan,
I first president of the University.
: There are also a group of restoration
| drawings of fossils showing how lisli
! looked when they were alive at a
period which scientists believe was
■more than a million years ago.
Skeleton of Great Auk Valuable
A collection of natural history and
j biological material furnished from the
zoological department of the Univer
sity completely fills the large balcony
! in the center of the building. The col
lection consists largely of sea life
species, including crabs, star fish, and
a variety of specimens from the sea
gardens. There is an extensive col
lection of California bird life.
The skeleton of a Great Auk, a bird
| which has been extinct for some sev
enty years, is looked upon as one of
the most precious of the pieces in the
i museum. Although it had well de
veloped wing bones, the Great Auk
was unable to fly. "This was perhaps
i because of its great weight," says Mr.
Lciuos. It stands nearly two feet, in
j height.
The Stanford Museum is an out
growth of a boyish interest. When
Loland Stanford, Jr., was eight years
old his father gave him a little cabinet
in which he put collections he had
made. These included primarily fossils
and natural history material, such as
wasps' nests, birds' eggs, and petrified
wood.
A few years later the Stanfords
went to Europe and the son continued
his collecting. It was on his return
to California when lie was thirteen
years old that the idea of some day
establishing a public museum in his
own city of San Francisco seems to
have taken more definite form. A
second trip to Europe was undertaken
some two years later. During this visit
the youth became infected with the
virus of Roman fever from which lie
never recovered.
When Senator and Mrs. Stanford
finally concluded to found a Univer
sity In memory of their son, it seemed
particularly appropriate to establish
a museum as a personal memorial.
Two rooms in the institution are given
over to those collections made by he
land, Jr., before lie was sixteen years
old.

A check written and signed by
I George Washington may be seen in a
room which holds a collection of early
American and colonial material. There
is also a musket which was used in
the Revolutionary War. Laces col
lected by Mrs. Stanford and textiles
from many countries make up a col
lection in still another room.
In a larger room there is a miscel
laneous display of museum articles
from different parts of the world. How
ever, a great part of the space in this
room is being arranged for a display
of European crafts and articles de
picting the life of North American
Indians.
j Fossils make up an interesting part
I of the museum displays. A large col
i lection has been turned over to the
! institution by Dr. David Starr Jordan,
I first president of the University.
: There are also a group of restoration
| drawings of fossils showing how lisli
! looked when they were alive at a
period which scientists believe was
■more than a million years ago.
Skeleton of Great Auk Valuable
A collection of natural history and
j biological material furnished from the
zoological department of the Univer
sity completely fills the large balcony
! in the center of the building. The col
lection consists largely of sea life
species, including crabs, star fish, and
a variety of specimens from the sea
gardens. There is an extensive col
lection of California bird life.
The skeleton of a Great Auk, a bird
| which has been extinct for some sev
enty years, is looked upon as one of
the most precious of the pieces in the
i museum. Although it had well de
veloped wing bones, the Great Auk
was unable to fly. "This was perhaps
i because of its great weight," says Mr.
Lciuos. It stands nearly two feet, in
j height.
