# PAYS $20 OF $10,000,000 TO END 500 LIMIT
## Sylva Weaver Makes Start On ”More Women For Stanford Fund” Uses Pay For Article To Foster Reform Idea She Started 
### 
Twenty dollars of the twenty million
urged by Sylva Weaver, women's edi
tor of the Stanford Daily last, quarter,
to rescue Stanford women from the
evils of tlie 500 limit is in hand. With
$20 received as a by-product 4>f the
agitation she started, Miss Weaver
has established the "More Women for
Stanford Fund," with the hope that
others may be moved to add to il until
the whole ten million is available.
Only $9,91)}),980 is required now. It
sounds funny, but Sylva Weaver is
not merely joking.
In the women's edition of the Daily
on May 19, Miss Weaver raised her
editorial voice for relief of Stanford
women with such effect that if echoed
all over the United States in editorial
quotations. The New York World
forthwith wired her for an article on
the subject and forthwith she wired
the article, for which the World paid
her $20. That twenty dollars she has
made the nucleus of the fund.
To Promote The idea
"I don't think that $20 will itself
accomplish anything toward such a
sum as ten million dollars, of course,"
said Miss Weaver, "but I am not start
ing the fund as a joke, most certainly.
I got the twenty dollars from this
idea that the 500 limit for women at
Stanford is working harm to women
and to the University and I want to
devote it to promoting efforts to bring
this harm to an end. Call it a publicity
fund, if you want to.
"I earnestly hope that some real
philanthropist will be moved to bene
fit Stanford and education as il is
provided at Stanford by giving a real
sum of money to remove this restric
tion on the number of women who can
receive a Stanford education.
Objects To Unnatural Limit
"The little group of five hundred
women in a student body of 3,500 or
4,000 is nn unnatural social unit. It
creates ;ill sorts of artificial conditions
that are bad for both the women and
Ihe men of Stanford. Stanford women
would have a much fairer chance at
being themselves in normal fashion
and .consequently gain much more
from Stanford if they were not such
a conspicuously small minority.
"And the men students also would
gain by the possibility of more nor
mal. natural, less artificial social pro
portions between men and women in
the student body."
Opposes Lop-sided Coeducation
In her editorial which attracted such
widespread attention Miss Weaver
said: "Since 1905, when the 500 limit
was placed in effect, Stanford has bad
lop-sided coeducation, a double stand
ard, and discrimination against, the
Five Hundred." She quoted President
Itay Lyman Wilbur as saying that the
only way there can be an increase
in the number of women at Stanford
"would be by the establishment of a
separate endowment for the education
of women, with some leasing arrange
ments for the use of the campus and
other facilities of the University," and
said thai competent lawyers substan
tiate Ibis opinion.
"Stanford women," said she, "need
a savior willi about ten million dol
lars —a mythical Mrs. darkness who
will prove the godmother of the Five
Hundred and put a Twenty before the
figure."
