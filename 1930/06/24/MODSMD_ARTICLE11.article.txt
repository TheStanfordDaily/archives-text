# SUMMER QUARTER OPENS WITH REGISTRATION DANCE AT ROBLE
## 
### 
The Summer quarter social season
at Stanford opened last Friday night
with the registration dance at Roble
Hall. Transfers, graduates, and regu
lar students gathered to meet and
greet each other; some of the more
ambitious guests even managed to get
a foothold on the crowded dance floor.
New and old students were wel
comed by the reception committee,
which included: Dr. and Mrs. Robert
10. Swain, acting president of the
university; Miss Jessie Fleming, presi
dent of Roble; Miss Anastasia Doyle,
the new social director at Roble;
Mrs. Walter Shockley, who is giving
up her position as director to live, at
Berkeley, and Dean Mary Yost.
Music was furnished from !> until 1

| o'clock by Tommy Murphy's orclies j
I Iras and refreshments were served in |
the form of punch and cakes.
The lobby was attractively decora!
Ed and the general informality of this
iirst 'jolly up" was enlivened by nil
| morons "tag" dances which promoted
j acquaintance and removed the neces
sity for frigid and formal introduc- '
j lions. A number of bridge tables were i
| set up in the room on the right of the 1
| lobby and those who were bridge-j
i minded enjoyed an evening of trump-j
ing their partner's aces while their j
more lively comrades danced with
I such enthusiasm that it was alter
one when the orchestra members lin-
I ally managed to pack up and leave. i
