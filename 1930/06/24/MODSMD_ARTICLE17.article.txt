"How much money ya got?"
"I haven't any," pleaded Harry Lee
Logan, star of the last Junior Opera.
"Well, fork over what ya got." This
from the driver of the auto that was
helping Harry hitch-hike South after
Spring quarter finals.
"Oh, yeah. You can't get blood from
a turnip." Hut despite his nonchal
ance Harry was getting nervous for
the stretch by Pismo Beach is deso
late and lonely. Then lie remembered
the toy water pistol some of his Delta
Chi brothers had dropped in his over
coat pocket as a departing gift. There
was one thing to do, â€”tool the would
be hold-up.
The driver started to reach for his
gun but he wasn't quick enough.
Harry pressed a shiny revolver into
his ribs and ordered him to drive to
San Luis Obispo.
Harry reached San Luis safely, but
his inhospitable companion remains
ignorant that he was duped by a ten
cent water pistol.
