work has been started on the theatre
immediately following the close of the
Hillsborough district school on the
grounds of which the theatre is
located. Since little else other than
the picturesque gnarled old trees
which were retained within the area
of the theatre when it was planned
and the concrete stage erected for the
orchestra is of a permanent nature,
considerable work must he done each
season in advance of the concerts to
recreate the setting for these musical
programs.
I Early in the year, many hardy plants
arid shrubs are planted flanking and
bordering the stawe so that by mid
summer they are a definite part of the

location may be enhanced and per
fected without giving any impression
, of artificiality.

orchestra is of a permanent nature,

season in advance of the concerts to
recreate the setting for these musical
programs.
