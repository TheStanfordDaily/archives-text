# THERE'S MUSIC IN THE AIR

### 
The Daily would like to re en force the words of appreciation that
have been spoken l>v a number «»f people for the chances that are given
the I'riiversitv community this summer to hear good music and to hear
about good music :tt very trivial expense.
In fact there is no expense at all except for the concerts by the San
Francisco Symphony under distinguished conductors at the delightful
outdoor Woodland Theatre, which is almost at our door —and the cost
of those has been made only 50 cents each for Stanford people.
<>1 iii Downes, who will give a series of talks here later, from every
thing that is said about him anil from the subjects that lie has selected,
seems to be a wholly virile and alert personality, a man to vvlhuu it will be
a pleasure to listen as he discusses the music of the world and of the ages.
George McManus, well-known pianist, will give a recital in the As
sembly 11 all <>n Thursday.
Warren I J. Allen is. of course, known to more than Stanford people,
and in the Memorial < hurch organ he has an instrument of line <|tiality
lor his recitals on Thursdays and Sundays. The Memorial < 'hurch is a
liiting place for a quite half hour of organ music. Such half-hours are
worth profiting bv.
