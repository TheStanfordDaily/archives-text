# REGULAR GUYS

### 
In n recent novel, I rrmlniill, by Lola lean Simpson, the author has
occasion to speak of men school teachersâ€”California school teachers, bv
ilit* way. She neatly epitomizes licr views by saying, among other things,
that men teachers resembled cases of "arrested development" and were,
as a class, dcidedly lacking in initiative. The inference is that that state
ment characterizes the great majority of all men teachers.
Everyone has seen individual examples, perhaps, of such cases, fhit
surely a survey of Stanford's campus this summer quarter would reveal
IfW who would fil such an uncharitable description. And there are many
teachers here. Let those who think they can always "spot" a school
teacher try it.
Once, the reflection that "those who can, do: those who can't, teach"
might have applied. 11 is disproved today by the type of men and women
who are in the profession. Once leaching was a stepping stone for the
aggressive ones: now. it is a career demanding the best of anv man's
ability.
Reserve your opinion, then, you who are in other departments, until
you meet a few of them. You II find must of these pedagogues "good
guvs."
