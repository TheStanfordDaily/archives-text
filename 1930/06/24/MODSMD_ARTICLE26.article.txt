# CREATIVE ECONOMICS

### 
Who is going In write tlit* story of creative economics? \Yc had our
story oi creative chemistry, and ii was a good story, too. l!nt it was a
story that had to he told after the fact and not before.
Who, fifty years ago. could have foretold the synthetic—and often
menial—origin of our silk stockings, our phonograph records, our per
fumes, our automobile tires, our "Knx-knox" gasolines, our invaluable
metal alloys, and a host of other articles that now have their romantic
origin buried in their prosaic everyday usefulness? They are the product,
it is true, of persistence and indelatigable energy on the part of hard
working scientists, but it is also just as true that they are. for the most
part, the unforeseen result of accidental discovery in the laboratory. Thev
were born in the crucible of experience.
Is there not a like story in the held of economics for somebody to
ten? Ihe crucible of experience bubbles here, too, and it has turned out
things as startling in their way as the wonders, of creative chemistry.
Modern trends in the world in which we are living have given us new
thoughts, or at least have caused us to revise <ild ones.
What has become of the law of "supply and demand"? Modern ad
vertising has seized the bull by the horns. 11 there is no demand, it cre
ates one ; it the demand i< too small, ii makes it bigger. Automobile manu
facturers are "overselling" the market every year with their millions of
cars, and still they seem to be getting along very*well, thank von.
And what about the theory that selling prices should be governed bv
the costs of production.*' Ford savs that the first thing to do is to set a
1«• vv selling price and sell your article, and then if vou sell enough of
them, modern methods ol managing industry and big business will bring
down these costs of producing. And l ord seems to have shown a pretty
good understanding of practical economics.
And what about all the evils that were to follow the introduction of
ihe machine age and the throwing of thousands of men out of work? It
has worked the other way. shorter working hours, higher wages, more
leisure for the consumption of goods, the need of more goods to be con
sumed, more factories, more employment. The American people consume
85 per cent of their own manufactures. The working man i< his own best
customer.
Ihe story of creative economics is still to be written—and still to be
lived.

thoughts, or at least have caused us to revise <ild ones.
What has become of the law of "supply and demand"? Modern ad
vertising has seized the bull by the horns. 11 there is no demand, it cre
ates one ; it the demand i< too small, ii makes it bigger. Automobile manu
facturers are "overselling" the market every year with their millions of
cars, and still they seem to be getting along very*well, thank von.
And what about the theory that selling prices should be governed bv
the costs of production.*' Ford savs that the first thing to do is to set a
1«• vv selling price and sell your article, and then if vou sell enough of
them, modern methods ol managing industry and big business will bring
down these costs of producing. And l ord seems to have shown a pretty
good understanding of practical economics.
And what about all the evils that were to follow the introduction of
ihe machine age and the throwing of thousands of men out of work? It
has worked the other way. shorter working hours, higher wages, more
leisure for the consumption of goods, the need of more goods to be con
sumed, more factories, more employment. The American people consume
85 per cent of their own manufactures. The working man i< his own best
customer.
Ihe story of creative economics is still to be written—and still to be
lived.
