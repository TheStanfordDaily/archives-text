Summer quarter will see another
test of the Honor System. May it
never die.
In an Eastern university (name on
request) the students were going to
he sure that they passed their llnals.
So they "hired" substitutes to take
their finals. The faculty caught on
ami demanded passport photos for
identification in the final exam.
Oh well, the Stanford faculty hasn't
asked for photographs.
Maybe the honor system failed in
the Eastern university.
Thoughts in picking a summer quar
ter course. Now this prof is from
XYZ College. He ought to he simple
—or maybe he is tough. It's funny,
but a visiting prof is either real easy
or the other extreme. Guess I'll wire
brother Zilch at our XYZ chapter and
get the low down. Then again, should
I take a chance? It's a sticker of a
course in regular session.
Yes, the Theta Delts are remodel
ing their house. Well, it needed it.
If some of the other houses on the
Row would do the same it might help
things.
Noticed a number of high school
athletes Attending summer quarter.
Good for them, but —where-'s our Sub
sidizing Committee? Athletes should
not he made to pass a certain aca
demic requirement.
At least, the Carnegie Foundation
said they did.
If we don't snap up these men, one
of our deadly rivals will offer them
athletic scholarships.
By the time a fellotf gets to he a
senior, it is mighty hard to find
courses to take. ■ , 1
All the possibilities of pipes are ex
hausted.
But then the summer quarter is
conducted purely for the pursuits of
the intellectual.
And poker hounds.
And more plays from the Dramatic
Council.
But part of the . r »00 are still here.
The dance last Friday at Rohle was
not so bad, considering it was free.
And a good time was had by all. —
Society Note.
Shall we be burdened with more
Rohle jolly-ups?
And these footloose women —alnt
they the cut-lips?
I hate women.
I couldn't get a date this week-end.
Of course that check of George
Washington's in the Stanford museum
had no rubber in it.
Which reminds us that we have sev
eral excellent museum pieces among
our collection of checks.
Sleepy Sam wants to know why the
recent Daily story, in which il was
estimated that 11(1,000 tourists visited
the Memorial Church last, year, failed
to mention the 15 student visitors.
Tim, the printer's devil, says that
bigamy laws were passed to prevent
men from taking more than I heir
shar* of the world's troubles.
Naw, we ain't got that book and if
we did have, if'ttd be out.
Rumor has il that Phainting Phil
and Der Maxie are scheduled to meet
next full. Sleepy Sam says thai when
two birds like that gel together it's
sure to be a fowl fight.
