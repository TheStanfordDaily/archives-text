# STUDIES THE WAYS OF AUTO CAMPS AND COPS
## 
### 
Fifty auto camps in twelve thous
and miles is the record claimed by C.
M. Case, visiting professor in the Econ
omics Department. During the past
nine months, Professor Case, who is
a sociologist at the University of
| Southern California, has been making
i a study of conditions in auto camps
I *
| and traffic problems.
"Starting from Los Angeles," he con
tinued, speaking of his trip, "my wife
and 1 toured the United States in an
open Studebaker. We spent the nigtat
| at auto camps whenever possible as I
I was especially interested in the kind
j of community life found there."
I Concerning the the evolution of the
I auto camp during the past decade Case
'said, "The type of" people who visit
j the camps has changed from the 'tin
! can tourist' who merely wanted a
' place to pitch his tent to more pros
perous people in expensive cars who
! seek the modern cottage camps be
i cause their conveniences rival those
of hotels. Some of these rent for as
much as seven dollars a day and have
j tile baths, maid service, and public
! grills."
Professor Case also made a study
jof traffic problems, behavior of the
J public toward traffic laws, and meth
| ods of dealing with offenders. Upon
j investigation he discovered that nine
i ty per cent of the accidents are caused
j by ten per cent of the people on life
| highways.
"The traffic problem is a social
| revolution which marks the trend
'from the 'old open highway' to one
I ruled by restrictions which necessi
tates an unnatural behavior of per
j sons toward others."
Advanced students in Professor
lease's summer quarter classes will
j assist him in a personal study of the
: behavior of motorists in regard to
I traffic officers, pedestrians, and anto
! mobilists.
