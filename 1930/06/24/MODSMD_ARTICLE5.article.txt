# McGILVARY TO START SERIES OF LECTURES
## 
### 
Questions of "predeterminism" and
"fret: will" form the hasis of the lirst
I ol' a series of popular lectures to lie
jgiven every Tuesday evening al eight
j o'clock in the Little Theatre. J'rofes
sor Evander 15. McGilvary of the pliil-
I osopliy department in his talk tonight
j on "Human Freedom" will show the
i extent to which he believes man is
j free to choose his own path and to
j make his own decisions in life.
Professor McGilvary, though lie ac
i cepts determinism as a proven hypo-
I thesis, believes that man is a free
agent. He says,"The contention of
many that determinism is irreconcil
able with responsibility is a serious
and dangerous mistake." It is a dan
gerous mistake, because it is apt to
cause lapses into "justifiable" immor
ality. There is a growing school of
"fatalistic determinists" which has, by
virtue of its forceful leaders, made
many believe that talk of "free will"
and "individual leadership" is more
jargon. It is the influence of this
school that Professor McGilvary ar
gues' against tonight.
Professor McGilvary comes lo Stan
ford from the University of Wisconsin
where for the past twenty-five years
I he lias been chairman of the depart
{ ment of philosophy, lie has also in
structed at Cornell, and the Univer
i sity of California in Berkeley and in
I Los Angeles.
