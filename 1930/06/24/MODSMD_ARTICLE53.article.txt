I Joyce 'I upper's message Sunday in I lie
| Memorial Church. "Unless there is
j religion as an experience and Christ
ianity as an inspiration all the differ-
I tut creeds are as sounding brass and
j tinkling symbal," he said. "We need
I less theology and more religion, less
(doctrine and more life, less creed and
| more character.
"There are four ways to look at re*
i ligion: as a creed, or something to he
| believed; as a ceremonial, or soin#
I th'ng to be performed; as philosophy,
lor something to be studied; and as life,
or something produced and experi
i enced."
Dr. Tapper's subject was: "Life vs.
1 Existence." "The life complete must
|ha ve something more than personal
ambition, or length and breadth. It
| nilist be more than merely flat and
1 level. It must have height, or human
j sy in pa tli.v."
Religion Comes by Experimentation i
Dr. Tapper emphasized the idea that 1
! "religion Is not so much intellectual 1
J assent, but rather spiritual consent, j
! It is something you do not get second- j
! hand by argumentation, but first-hand
(by experimentation. George Fox,
| founder of the Society of Friends,
'said: 'I know God by revelation.' lie
!did not say 'by intellectuallsm,' he
j continued.
i " 'I am come that ye might have

jeuce depends upon tilings and upon
ownership; it deals with flie tang-1
I ible and seen; life depends upon be-j
i ings and upon possession; it deals
! with the intangible and the unseen,
i Emerson was wrong when he said, 'I
am owner of the Sphere.' lie should
have said 'possessor.' .... In some \

respects Drowning was the greatest
I poet. He was the poet of immortality
and spiritual thought!
A Difference Exists
"The difference between Nero and i
Paul . . . and the difference between j
Oscar Wilde and Tennyson is (lie dif
ference between a soul that is dead
and a soul that is alive. One is giv- j
ing himself entirely to the tilings l
about him; the other, to spiritual life I
and power, growing into the beauty J
hi the sky.
"The religion of the more abundant
life is not so much self-surrender as it |
is spiritual conquests and glorious dis
coveries. II is not subjection, but free
dom.
