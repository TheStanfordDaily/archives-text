The smoke's the thing!
The taste, the aroma, all the natural goodness of tobacco's finest
qualities are in the delightful smoke that curls lazily from your
Camel Cigarette. Let it drift luxuriously about your face . . . taste
it, smell it, revel in it . . . smoke as much as you like! Whether it's the
first Camel of the day or the last one at night, every sense you have
will tell you that here is everything you have wished for in a cigarette.
