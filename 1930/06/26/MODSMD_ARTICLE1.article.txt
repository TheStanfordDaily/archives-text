Played Without Rehearsal
The lirst number on the program is \
the "Overture" from "Don Giovanni" j

effect, that Mozart, who was noted for i
his procrastination, had not written |
one bar of this composition on the eve j
of the performance of the opera "Don |
Giovanni," or "The Punishment of a j
Dissolute Man." To keep the compos-I
or awake, his wife told him fairy tales, |
and administered occasional glasses of
punch, but, as the work could only be j
handed over to the copyist the next j
morning, ii was not rehearsed, and j
had to be played at sight on the night I
of the, first performance, October 2!t, J
1787.
A special interest is attached to the [
second number on Sunday's program j
