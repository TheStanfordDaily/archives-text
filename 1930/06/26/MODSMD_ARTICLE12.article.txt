# WESLEY STEVENS, '33 ANNOUNCES MARRIAGE
## 
### 
Public announcement has been made
of the marriage of J. Wesley Stevens,
'lII', and Jean DeWitt of Piedmont.
They were married secretly in Keno
on February 15.
Cupid's gain is Pop VVarner's loss
as Stevens was a very promising lull
back. The loss, however, will nut be
permanent. Stevens, now employed in
Oakland, will return after a year's ab
sence to complete his course.
