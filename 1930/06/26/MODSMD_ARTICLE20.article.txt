# GET BREAKAGE FEES BACK
## 
### 
A Toyon resident suggests in ;i letter to the Daii.v, printed in another
column, that the I Diversity would save In making the breakage fees in
the halls part of lhe regular room rent. Mis idea is that the existence of
a breakage fee induces breakage, "for," as he savs, "where one is charged
tor breakage, to damage property appears to be bis right. Am 1 right?"
At first thought anybody would say that he is right, certainly. There
would seem to be a human temptation for hall residents to get their
money's worth—if they have to pay for breakage why not take advan
tage of the opportunity that they pay for? »
Hut inquiry shows that that is not all there is to the situation.
In Toyon and I'ranner, after the damage covered bv breakage fees
has been made good all money remaining in the fund is turned over to
the clubs which manage affairs in those halls. This amounts to several
hundred dollars and is a substantial addition to the nionev raised bv club
dues for the support of their activities.
In Kncina this year instead of a breakage fee everv freslunan was
required to make a $10 deposit, with the understanding that he would get
back any of it that was not required to repair damage to the hall beyond
reasonable wear and tear. Injury to individual rooms was assessed
against the occupants ol those rooms, while general damage was charged
against the fund as a whole.
There was this year, apparently as ;i result of this new provision, at
least partly, less wreck and rniti in Kncina than has been wrought for a
number of years.
Seemingly, then, the I'liiversity has devised a better plan for dis
couraging wanton mischic! than the device of including the breakage fee
in the room rent. Self-interest is being utilized to diminish destruction
rather than to increase it, as the b.wi.v's correspondent suspected is the
case.
