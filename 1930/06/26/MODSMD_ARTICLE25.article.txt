To the Editor. Sir:
Has the suggestion ever been made
that the .$1 breakage fee be included
jin the room rent? If not, I'm mak
ing it now. Such a charge would col- j
lect no more money, but would save
the University untold damage to its
property. For where one is charged ,
, for breakage, to damage properly ap
pears to he his right. Am I right?
