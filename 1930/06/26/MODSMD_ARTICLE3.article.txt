| "The problem of human freedom,"•
I according to Professor Evaiirier l». Mc
| Olivary in his Tuesday evening talk
in the Little Theatre, "can be discuss
ed only in contrast with the three
opposing views, fatalism, determinism,
and indeterininisin." The subject of
the lecture given by Professor McGil
vary, who comes to Stanford from the
j University of Wisconsin, was "Human
j Freedom."
"Fatalism is the view that certain
j events will happen regardless of all
I circumstances: it. is the idea, that ev
erything is decreed by fate. Det.erinin
| ism is the belief that any event is do-
I termined by preceding natural condi
l lions; tlius, if the conditions were dif
| ferent, the event would have been dif
ferent. Indetermiuisni presents the
! view that some events are not com
pletely determined by anything pre
ceding, either natural or supernatural.
I "If one joins the growing numbers
J who are adopting the deterministic j
j altitude. the interesting question
j arises as to whether the will is do
! termined by preceding events, and if
j il is, can il be maintained that there j
lis freedom? The determinist claims
i that freedom is compatible with deter
minism, but this claim of course de
| pends on his definition of freedom. In
j the words of the determinist, as well
j as in ordinary usage, man is free as
! long as there is no external imped!-
| men I to keep him from doing as he
I wills. Freedom is the relation of the
! will to tlie firture, not the past.
I Another qilestion which arises is
[ whether determinism is reconcilable
! with responsibility. To hold respon
sible, is to blame, praise, punish, or
i reward. Those acts are instinctive,
I hut intelligence has discovered that
I Ihe consequences are in many cases
| bad. This determines us to restrict,
jour praise and blame to situations
j where I hey are effective for results.
I Thus determinism maintains that in
telligent responsibility is necessary to j
restrict the actions of members of so
ciety.
"Growing numbers are. accepting de
terminism, and if lliey feel that they
are obliged to give up their belief in
j either morality or in determinism bo

j two, il is more than likely that moral
