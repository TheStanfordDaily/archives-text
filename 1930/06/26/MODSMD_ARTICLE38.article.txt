"Watch yourself on Pulm Drive; it
isn't a boulevard nor an unobstructed
stale highway."
This is Hie friendly warning issued
by Gordon Davis, rumpus traffic off
err. Officer Davis cruises about the
r a lupus and its by-ways in his little
while aulo, looking for trouble and
hoping lie won't 1 ill<| it bui acting
willi unyielding determination when
he has 10.
"Too many people," says Davis,
"think I hat forty miles an hour is the
proper speed the length of Palm Drive.
They have lo lit! told. I hale lo make
the judge tell them, but sometimes I
must.
"Thirty miles is about the best you
can risk, because at Ihe intersect ions
fifteen is the fixed legal limit. Inter
sections tuake most of I lie trouble;
.'■•peeding by intersections is had busi
ness."
Davis gives the pleasant news thai
it is visitors, rather than students, who
do I lie worst driving. He lias to take
these violators of traffic regulations
lo county courts, too, which adds to
his labors, Student violators he cites 1
to Mie student councils for punish
ment. Several students were sent to
off-campus courts during Hie last few
days, before Men's Council was or
ganized.
"I don't get any fun out of arresting |
Mliidents," says the (anipus cop. "I'd
like it a good deal better if not one •
of I hem ever had to be arrested. My
job is as much to prevent bad driv
ing, to warn drivers that they better,
lie a little more thoughtful and care-'
ful. as it is to catch tlieni speeding.
"Hut believe me, if I have to arrest
them I do it. I think I am a friend
of the students, but I am too good a
friend of all of them to let a crazy
few risk the safety of the rest as well
as of themselves."
