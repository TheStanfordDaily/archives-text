# FISH DECLARES GRANT'S CAREER MOST ROMANTIC
## Visiting Professor Points Out Contradictions of the Famous General Says Civil War Leader's Soul Was Enigma 
### 
"Grant had I lie' most romantic ca-
I reer of any Anieriean."
This was I lie verdict of Dr. (<arl
Russell Fish, visiting professor of his
tory from the, University of Wiseon
'roll, who spoke in the, Little Theater
lon IJ.S. Grant, yesterday afternoon,
i "Grant's earner w;is the most ro
j niantic because of the "extremes lie
| experienced. A flat failure for forty
years, in four years elevated to the
eominand of the Union armies, a grad
ual decline during the presidency and
after, then in two days time abysmal
failure," said Dr. Fish, referring to the
failure <>) the financial firm in which
Grant was interested.
I Opening his lecture by admitting
that Grant was an enigma to most hi
ographers, Dr. Fish characterized him
as "one of the inarticulate who do
things." Grant did not reveal his
soul and biographers are interested
mainly in people's souls."
Unusually Sensitive As Boy
Jn order to explain the man, Grant,
Dr. Fish described and analyzed
Grant as a boy. He explained Grant's
I boyhood, presenting the unusual pic
! lure of an extremely sensitive, elean
| minded boy who hated swearing, dirty
stories, and girls. An unusual charac
teristic of Grant's was that lie couldn't
stand the sight of blood; it made liiin
sick and faint.
It was ironical, Dr. Fish pointed out,
that Grant eventually went to West
Point. On account of his distaste for
the bloody business of war Grant did
not want to go to West Point, but
! since the other alternative was his
father's tannery, he chose the former.
) "Grant's career until he became
General was a failure, declared Dr.
Fish. Grant spent his time worrying
about how to make his meagre salary
go around and at times in thinking of
I what he could do with a fortune. In
his mind he worked with the improb
able, so that when the improbable
I happened in the Civil War lie wfis able
to handle the situation.
Had Remarkable Memory
Referring to Grant's drinking, Dr.
, Fish epigrammatically said, "Grant
began drinking to escape reality. In
an army where officers got properly
and riotously drunk at regular inter
vals, Grant got improperly and isolat
iedly drunk at improper intervals."
One of Grant's strongest mental
i characteristics was his memory. Said
Dr. Fish: "I think of Grant's mind
as being an empty room with mottoes
hung around reading 'do this', 'do that,'
'do not do this.' That characteristic
helps account for his success as a gen
eral."
Speaking of Grant as President, Dr.
Fish summarized his views by saying
"There is one primary reason why lie
didn't succeed as President. When he
entered the army there was an oppor
tunity ahd he knew his trade. When
lie was President, there was an op
portunity and he didn't know his
trade."
