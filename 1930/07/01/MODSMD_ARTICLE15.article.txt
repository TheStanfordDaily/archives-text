# WORK OF LEAGUE OF NATIONS TO BE EXPLAINED BY HOLSTI AT LITTLE THEATRE LECTURE
## 
### 
That the League of Nations has passed the experimental stage is emphati
cally asserted by Dr. Rudolf Hoist i, Finnish Minister to Switzerland, and per
manent delegate to the League, who will give a lecture on its actual operations
tonight in the Little Theater at 8 o'clock. The title of his lecture is "The
Workings of the League of Nations."
"Of course, Dr. Holsti stated, "we must not be too optimistic about the
League. You must remember that it is only ten years old."
Criticism Not Necessary Indication of Its Failure
"Although it will be difficult in so short a time to explain the rather

complicated organization of the
League," he added in regard to his lec
ture, "I shall touch the most important
phases of its work."
Dr. Hoist i explained that like any
other institution its development had
not been without difficulties. He said
that criticism of the League was not
necessarily any indication of its fail
ure. He likened the League to a bank
whose board of directors, although
supporting the bank wholeheartedly,
yet differed at times with the way the
bank was being conducted. The mem
bers of the League are like a board
of directors who oftentimes have dif
ficulty in agreeing upon its policies.
Declares Co-operation Necessary
I)r. Holsti said that the League has
the support of all the governments of
Europe. He explained that a nation's
co-operation with the League depend
ed a great deal on the party in power
in a country. If a radical or liberal
party is in power much better co-op
eration is likely than if a conservative
party has control.
"A great many Americans visit
Geneva in September when t lie As
sembly meets," Dr. Holsti remarked,
"and are surprised at the efficient
operation of the League. They seem
to have the idea that we do not get
much done."
