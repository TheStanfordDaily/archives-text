# ABELARD'S LIFE TO BE SUBJECT OF HULME'S LECTURE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Abelard, who has been character
ized by Professor Edward Maslin
Hulme as "the idol of Paris and the
most famous teacher of his time," will
be the subject of the Wednesday af
ternoon lecture at 4:15 in the Little
Theatre.
In speaking of the personality of
this great scholar, Professor Hulme
says, "Abelard was handsome and
charming: his voice was rich and reso
nant; his learning was wide, his
thought bold. Nothing human was
foreign to him. Yet, like every other
man he had his defects. He was vain,
arrogant, and impatient of contradic
tion; he appealed to the: gallery; and
he did not disdain to jest and gibe at
his rivals and enemies."
It is the romantic life, personality,
and accomplishments of Peter Abelard
011 which Professor Hulme intends to
dwell. While still a lad, Abelard left
home to lead the life of a wandering
scholar. While on this "quest of learn
ing," he gained much of the knowledge
which enabled him later to meet and
defeat in debate the master dialecti
cians of the early twelfth century.
Despite the fact that Abelard him
self was convicted of heretical teach
ings, his books burned, and his fol
lowers excommunicated, Professor
Hulme says, "Abelard's own thought
was not heretical. Me differed from
his opponents only in his effort to re
construct as far as possible the sphere
of authority and increase that of
reason."
Professor Hulme, who has been at
Stanford since 1021 and has also in
structed at the Universities of Idaho,
California, Oregon, Utah, and Chicago
University, is acclaimed one of the
world's foremost authorities on the his
tory of the middle ages.
