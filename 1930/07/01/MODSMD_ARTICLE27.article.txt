# IT'S THE MAN HIMSELF

W itli tlie election nf Almon F. Roth, Stanford graduate and comptrol
ler, to the presidency of Rotary International, the I Diversity once more
comes conspicuously before the nation and, indeed, the world as an in
itntion whose graduates are fitted for leadership. This is becoming a
frequent thing. Stanford has come of age, and its men and women are
developing to the point where national and world leadership i:s being con
ferred on them.
The other day it was I lenrv Suzzallo and liis election to the presidency
oLthe Carnegie Foundation. A day or two before that l'aul Downing was
put in line for the presidency of the National Flectric Light Association.
Hoover, of course, is a brilliant example. Wilbur, now secretary in I loov
er's cabinet, has for veitrs been a national and international figure in sev
eral fields.
Alumni of Stanford may take pride in the recognition accorded to
these fellow nlnmni and to the glory which they confer on Stanford. Xot
all the glory that comes to a university is derived from its athletic teams,
as some alumni sometimes seem to think. Stanford has had and is having
her share of benefit from that source, but it is a fair guess that the
achievements of Hoover, W ilbur, Roth, Downing, Suzzallo and their like
add more permanent and substantial fame to the Stanford name than do
any victorious teams.
Sometimes, too, alumni seem to get the idea that athletics provide the
best training for future success. W ell, Roth was an athlete and a good
one; Hoover was not. Downing was an athlete; Wilbur was not. Suz
zallo was not: lie was an intercollegiate debater and his training in that
activity, it may be safely surmised, has helped him in building bis career.
It isn't athletics or anything else that makes the man, apparently; it
is the stuff the man has in him and what he does with it. Some men
bound towards success are athletes and some are not. Conceivably, though
intercollegiate athletics is ae line and useful enterprise, a university could
turn out its quota of eminently successful leaders even if it had no inter
collegiate teams at all.
