# GIVE THEM ROOM

I lie plea, voiced in ;i nearby column of iliis paper, for at least two
score and ten beds on this campus in which a man more than six foot
tall may lie at ease and get an unbroken night's rest will strike a chord of
sympathy in every heart that gives a moment's thought to the plight of
these elongated sufferers. Let those of us who stopped growing at a more
convenient length imagine how we'd like to try to sleep in a fiv,e-foot -six
iron cot, with our feet jabbing the rigid iron bars at the foot or projecting
out into the cold night air without covers. â€¢
1 hat s what the fellow martyrs of tin's pleader undergo every night
of their lives. 'I'hey must wake themselves up to pull in their legs or to
cover them up it they are to gain even partial comfort : or for something
approaching complete comfort thev must learn to curl themselves up into
a ball.
For ages the bed of Procrustes has been one of the world's most ter
rible examples of torture. Procrustes made out-size men in respect of
length fit his bed by cutting off as much extra leg as necessary for the
purpose. That won't do for Stanford men, and vet the petition
to the administration to do something about it deserves consideration.
Maybe when President \\ ilbur gets back on the campus our correspondent
can get action. President Wilbur has himself a height which when
placed horizontally must give him acute memories of Encina's iron cots.
