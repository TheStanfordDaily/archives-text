# UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS AS BUSINESS MANAGERS
## 
### 
I wo great universities have recently elevated to the presidency men
whose chief qualifications are that they are business men. At the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania an interesting departure from traditional pro
cedure has been made in having what virtually amounts to two presidents.
< )ne man, called a provost, will he in charge of the scholastic activities of
the institution, and another man, who hears the title of president, will he
principally concerned with the business administration.
()i more local interest is the elevation yesterday of Dr. Robert CI.
Sproul to the presidency of the University of California. Sproul was
formerly comptroller of the university and*his chief qualification for the
position is his business and executive ability.
It is undoubtedly true that the size»of many universities today, with the
attendant problems of investments, salaries, equipment, and buildings de
mands the attention of an astute "big business man. Traditionally, the
president of a university is also a great scholar. To find a man who
would be both of these things at once has been a perplexing problem.
Although there is no good reason why a university should not be run
as etliciently as any business, such a step will seem to many as just one
more bit of evidence of the commercialization of education. It seems
wrong to think of an educational institution as a business. Somehow we
all hold to the romantic idea that a university is solely an institution of
learning. We want to believe that it is a scholarly retreat where pro
found problems are contemplated, where deep research is carried on—a
place where economics is studied abstractly rather than practically applied.
Hut. of course, medieval ideas and methods are no more feasible in
education than in other activities in this changing world. It is a far cry
trom the small groups of students who gathered around a professor and
who were willing to sacrifice all in their pursuit of learning to the present
universities with their multitude of courses and professors and with their
thousands of students.
