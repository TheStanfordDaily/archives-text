To the Editor. Sir:
I urn taking this opportunity of air
ing a grievance. 1 believe tliftt spe
cial length beds should be available in
the dormitories for men of unusual
stature. There must be at least fifty
men at Stanford, who measure six
feet two or more; it is almost impos
sible for them to sleep comfortably in
a standard length bed. If the authori
ties would install fifty of these special
beds, they would find plenty of "gi
raffes" ready to occupy them and
willing to share any extra expense.
Yours for bigger and better things,
Hartwell Preston.
