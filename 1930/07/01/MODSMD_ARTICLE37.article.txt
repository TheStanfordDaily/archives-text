Speaking in Spanish, Professor An
tonio G. Solalinde, visiting Professor
of Spanish from the University of
Wisconsin, gave an illustrated lecture
last night in the Little Theatre on
"Las Regiones de Espunaâ€”Costuni
bres y Arte." This lecture was a con
tinuation of the one Professor Sola
linde gave last week.
Spanish scenes were shown by
means of slides picturing New Cas
tile, Toledo, Madrid, Guadalajara, ami
Cuenea. According to Professor So
lalinde, Toledo is tint most interesting
of the Spanish cities, since it shows
many different types of architecture.
Among the slides of Toledo was one
showing the house where Cervantes
lived and wrote for a short time. Most
of the slides were of Toledo anil Mad
rid. Those of Madrid showed the roy
al palace, the city hall, and various
scenes around the new part of the
city.
The most spectacular city, accord
ing to Professor Solalinde, is Cuenea,
where the river has cut out a minia
ture Grand Canyon and the buildings
are all on the tops of cliffs, resembling
the pueblo dwelling of early American
Indians.
