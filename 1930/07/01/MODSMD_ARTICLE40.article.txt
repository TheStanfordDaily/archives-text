### 
Opening his piano recital of Thurs
day night with an informal speech,
(ieorge Stewart McManus, head of the
department of music at the University
of Southern California, made a series
of interesting comments on each of his
numbers. The recital was held at
8:1 rÂ» p.m. in the Assembly Hall before
an appreciative audience.
McManus opened his program with
the Mendelssohn E. minor "Prelude
and Fugue" in answer to a special
request.
McManus next played the Scarlatti
"Sonata" which appeared- as the first
number on the printed program.
The last number in the first group
of selections was the Mozart 'Gigue"
which was played with a remarkable
distinctness throughout the rapid pas
sages.
McManus' second group of numbers
included three Schumann composi
tions: "Romance in F Sharp Major,"
, "Vogle als Prophet," or "Bird and Pro
phet," and the "Novelette in E Major."
The first number in McManus' third
group was.the "Intermezzo," Opus 117,
No. I ,by Brahms. The theme of thiK
composition was taken from an old
Scottish cradle song. The next num
ber was the Brahms "Ballade" Opus
lIS, which was written during
Bralnn's most mature period. Brahms
"Ballade" was followed by the "Third
Ballade" of Chopin which is character
ized by its grandiose style and numer
ous climaxes.
The last group of compositions be
gan with "Sonetto 12.1 del Petrarca."
The next was a "Barcarolle" by Lia
dow which began in a mood of joy
ous exaltation, but ended with a pass
age of quiet sadness.

the distinctly modern composition,
"Polonaise Americaine" by the pro
