"A woman, unbeautiful at twenty,
need not wear a veil; but if she is not
beautiful at sixty, then she should be
veiled." Thus spoke Rev. Kerr Boyce
Tupper, in his sermon delivered last
Sunday at the Memorial Church.
"Gazing upon the lights of God the
soul of man is changed," he said. "The
inner soul must be transfigured before
the outer may be transformed. Man,
like a reflector, glorifies, intensifies,
beautifies the Light of God. A tho
roughly good person is never a tho
roughly ugly person."
The sermon also dealt with the fact
that Christianity is not a system or an
organization, but essentially a spirit
ual experience and a spiritual exist
ence. Truth taught is a system, truth
lived is a demonstration. When God
made truth almighty, God madt it in
carnal*' in Christ. His Son.
