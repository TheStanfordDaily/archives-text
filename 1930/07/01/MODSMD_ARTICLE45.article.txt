# MacQuarrie Tells of Junior College Plan for Industrial Education
## 
### 
That the standard four year college
course is not practical for many .stu
dents is the opinion of Dr. Thomas \V.
MacQuarrie, president of the San Jose
State College, and acting professor in
I education for the summer quarter.
At the San Jose State College I)r.
MacQuarrie is carrying out a plan in
'volving a two-year course in indus
trial education instead of the regular
lower division work. This is a new
experiment in the junior college and it
seems to he working out very satis
factorily according to Dr. MacQuarrie.
The plan consists of a practical appli
cation outside of school of the techni
jcal knowledge which is acquired in the
classes. Students are paid by regular
| industrial concerns for the work which
they do. This enables many individ
uals to go to school who could not
I afford to otherwise.
Eliminates Useless Requirements
Such requirements as two years of
foreign language, which are useless to
the student who does not expect to
i finish his university education, are
eliminated under tin's plan. When the
student enters school lie is required
i to take a series of personnel examina
tions, which have been found to be
I extremely accurate in determining the
; line of work for which the individual
i student is most suited.
Dr. MacQuarrie deplores the fact
that generally there seems to be a
â€¢ stigma attached to such courses and
to those who do not receive a com
-1 plete college education. This idea is
erroneous, because it often takes as
much skill to do the work which is
included in these courses as it does
in the regular academic course. The
difference between them is in the kind
of skill which'is required. The indus
trial courses are for the students who
must take a shorter time in school
I training and a longer time in the
school of experience. The important
! thing for a student, Dr. MacQuarrie
believes, is to find where he fits into
I the school of life, and where he will
be tiie most successful and happy.
Courses Are Practical
The industrial courses in San Jose
State College include a number of
different departments. One of the
most useful courses is that which is
I offered in technical industrial train
| ing for engineering. In this course
| there is opportunity for municipal
training, such as working for electric
light companies in near-by cities
, where a practical knowledge of phy
j sics and electrical engineering is ne
cessary. With the water companies
the students learn to put the study of
chemistry to practical use in the pro
cess of water analysis.
Students who train for police depart
ment work are put on part time duty
as traffic officers and patrolmen.
Others work for the fire department
where they receive practical training
which will help them later to become
efficient fire chiefs and municipal lire
experts. There are also municipal po
sitions in food inspection to be had.
Another important department is
that of store management where ac- 1

counting students secure training in
the various city stores.
Experimental Laboratory For Children
The course in hotel management is
also attractive to many students. It
offers the opportunity of both cater
ing and desk-manager positions. Many
of the students in this course have al
ready found employment, Dr. Mac-
Quarrie .stated.
In connection with the College there
is a child experimental laboratory
where children of pre-shcool age are
cared for, fed, and entertained by girls
who are taking the
There is also a library assistant's
course for students who to wish to
work part time in the library.
Next year there will be a new and
unique course established in laundry
management, according to Dr. Mac-
Quarrie. An investigator has already
been sent throughout the state to se
cure information from the large laun
dries in regard to this course.
