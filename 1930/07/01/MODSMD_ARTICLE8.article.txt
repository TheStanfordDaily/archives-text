# CARDINAL COLORED MATCHES REPLACE BLUE TIPPED ONES
## 
### 
No longer will the loyal Stanford
smoker find twenty blue tipped gold
matches enclosed in a Cardinal red
container bearing a Stanford seal in
the package Riven him when tobacco
is purchased at the Union store. White
matches with red tips are now being
made to replace the California color
ed matches.
According to W. R. Gunther, manag
er of the store and designer of the
red covers, the flaunting of California
colors lias not been treachery, but
economy. The Union spends between
sixty and seventy dollars a month on
safety matches, and the blue and gold
variety which is tlie standard kind is
the least expensive. Gunther, how
ever, has now submitted to the proper
disapproval of the color inconsistency
and has ordered that the red and
white variety be made.
