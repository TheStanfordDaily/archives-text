# Pygmalion Sets to be in Character with Shaw
## Main Doorway Of St. Paul's Cathedral Is Seen In First Act 
### 
The settings for "Pygmalion," first
campus play of the Hummer quarter,
which is to be produced the evening
of July 11, will lie typical of the true
Shavian atmosphere.
| The first act is laid befor the central
j doorway of St. Paul's Cathedral in
London on a midsummer evening dur
ing a sudden shower. The cathedral,
which represents the Christopher
Wren style of architect lire, is of the
Renaissance period. It is famous
throughout the world for its stately
architecture and its chimes, which
peal out several times during the act.
The tall columns of the portico lend
an air of stately grace to the setting,
j Rain actually falls in this scene.
In the next act we find the labora
tory of Henry Higgins on Wimpole
street, where the erratic professor
lives surrounded by his books and his
many phonetical instruments. It is a
rather untidy room, suggestive of its
owner and entirely undisturbed by the
would-be primness of bis housekeeper,
Mrs. Pearce.
The third act is in Mrs. Higgins
drawing room. It is the cultured room
of a cultured woman. Mrs. Higgins
is a woman who was brought up to ap
preciate the art of Hum Jones, Wil
liam Morris, and Cecil Larson and her
drawing room is representative of
(these men and their period. Large
| windows at the back of the room
j give the audience a glimpse of the
; river and its distant banks."
