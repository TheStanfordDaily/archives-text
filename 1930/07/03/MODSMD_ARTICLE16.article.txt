# RAVEL'S "BOLERO" WILL BE PLAYED AT SYMPHONY CONCERT
## 
### 
i
Ravel's "Bolero" which has aroused
greater interest than any other recent
composition, will be presented by the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
under the direction of Bernardino Mo
linari al Hit! Woodland Theatre! coil
cert Sunday.
In this unusual number, which is to
be the concluding selection on Sun
day's program, Ravel set for himself
the problem of repeating a single
them incessantly over a basso ostinato.
Without the relief of any trick of
development, or any change in rhytlun,
jhe has contented himself with giv
| ing different colors to the motif hy the
! most varied play of instrumentation,
} thus achieving a sonorous progression
'uninterrupted until the end.
First Time in America
Presented for the. first time in Auier
ica will he the Symphonic Scherzo
I from "Don Quixote." In 1924 this
| composition was awarded the Ricordi
Prize in Italy. Instead of attempting
to portray the classic knight's adven
tures, the "Don Quixote" is a synthet
ic expression of the outstanding tea
Mures in the character of this Mock
j Knight as his own mind was supposed
j to have pictured them.
The opening number in the sym
i phony concert will be the "Kgmont"
mverture by Beethoven. The music to
"Egmont" was composed at a time
I when Beethoven was strongly under
jt.be influence of Goethe. In the spirit
iof Goethe's drama, the overture is
charged with an air of sombre fate
and heroic resolution, softened with
touches of remorse.
Fourth Symphony To Be Played
The Fourth Symphony, which is
j considered to be the most beautiful
j of all of Brahm's symphonies will be
I the longest selection on the program.
I It is significant to note that this was
| the last composition that the com
j poser ever conducted.
The concert Sunday will conclude
Molinari's engagement at the Wood
land Theatre this summer. From here
he will go to Los Angeles as guest
conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Or
chestra.
