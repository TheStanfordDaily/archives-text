# GIFTED CHILDREN RETAIN HIGH IQ'S STATES TERMAN
## Many Of thousand Do Not Measure Up To Ability In Their Present Classwork Investigation Reveals That More Girls Than Boys Fail To Hold Up 
### 
Only eight or len out of I lie "thou
sand gifted children" whom Dr. Lewis
M. Terman selected to study in his
well-known investigation have fallen
off in their intelligence quotients al
though more have failed to do the
quality of school work they are cap
able of. This war. the declaration of
Dr. Ternutn to a large group of school
men attending the JOdueation lunch
eon yesterday noon.
"As a group," Dr. Terman said,
"they are not disappointing, with the
exception of eight or ten of the thou
sand who seemed to have deteriorated,
their intelligence quotients have re
mained constant."
In the matter of actual school
achievement, however, he said there
are more disappointments. As a whole
they are above other groups in the
same grade or class, but uaing their
mental age as a standard, all of them
do not measure up to their ability.
Stanford Binet Test Not Finished
An interesting result of the inves
tigation is the apparent fact that more
girls failed to hold up than hoys. The
study revealed that girls, after they
have reached (lit; early "teen" age, do
not develop as well as boys.
Dr. Terman said that the revision of
the Stanford-liinet test would not be
items of the (est, two and a half years
in trying out and testing the items,
i
I and two more years will be spent in
establishing norms for the tests in
; various parts of the United Stales.
Seven full time assistants have been
engaged to do this work.
The test when it is completed will
be valfd from the two year old to the
superior adult.
Stanford Men Dccidedly Masculine
In summarizing other work being
conducted by his department, Dr. Ter
man told of the investigation of sex
differences in non-infelloclual traits.
Part of the work consists of giving
masculinity-femininity tests.
Dr. Terman caused much laughter
( by saying, "Results of these tests
given to school men show that they
are decidedly masculine."
Forty or fifty football players tested
; were highest in masculinity traits.
; Lawyers were also high in the scale.
The results of this study will be
'published. Volume one will be on

physical dimorphism; volume two, a
nummary of the psychological litera
ready to publish before two years.
One year was used in assembling the
ture on sex differences; and volume
three on experimental masculinity
femininity tests.

Stanford Men Dccidedly Masculine
In summarizing other work being
conducted by his department, Dr. Ter
man told of the investigation of sex
differences in non-infelloclual traits.
Part of the work consists of giving
masculinity-femininity tests.
Dr. Terman caused much laughter
( by saying, "Results of these tests
given to school men show that they
are decidedly masculine."
Forty or fifty football players tested

The results of this study will be

physical dimorphism; volume two, a
nummary of the psychological litera
ready to publish before two years.
One year was used in assembling the

three on experimental masculinity
femininity tests.

"As a group," Dr. Terman said,
"they are not disappointing, with the

mained constant."
In the matter of actual school
achievement, however, he said there
are more disappointments. As a whole
they are above other groups in the

mental age as a standard, all of them
do not measure up to their ability.
