jis bold enough 1.0 oppose the whole
j League," pointed out Dr. Klldolf I lot
I sti after naming several instances
j where the immediate action of the
I Council of the League had averted
war within the last few years. The
'council is the executive organization
j of the League ready to act at a mo
meat's notice. When it addresses a
communication to a nation that, ap
pears to be verging toward war, th<>
weight and influence of fifty nations,
the whole League, is back of the com
munication. I)!'. Ilolsti is the Finnish
