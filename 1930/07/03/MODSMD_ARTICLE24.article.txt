# NO "MAY" ABOUT IT

### 
Robert (1. Sproul. new president of the I'Diversity of ( rdifornia, is
quoted by the newspapers as saying that he would "watch the tests made
in other universities of the country and state with keen interest, and ii
educational methods superior to our own are evolved, we may adopt
them."
Much as we dislike to discredit our fellow journalist, that "may"
arouses a suspicion in our minds that the quotation is not entirely authen
tic. After thirty-eight years of observing our competitor across the bay,
we question any inference that she might fail to make a change of policy
if the benefits were apparent.
California has reached her recognized eminence in education through
eagerness t<> adopt progressive methods. Stanford claims part <>i the
credit for California's development. Thirty-eight years ago the I Diver
sity of California was merely a good enough sort of university. Stanford
entered Cal's field, free to experiment and try things out ; California has
been alert to profit by this competition.
.President Sproul is a typical California alumnus; he has the progres
sive spirit of his university. Ile will adopt every possible educational
method superior to those in operation as soon as tests have demonstrated
ihe superiorityâ€”there is no "may" about it.
