# VALUE IN STANDARDS
## 
### 
The other dav a student who had transferred to Stanford from an
other university was heard to complain about the strictness of the re
quirements made by certain departments. Later in the same day another
student in an entirely different department made the same complaint.
While in individual cases the rules and regulations of Stanford may
work a hardship, on the whole they have a salutary effect. 1 hey are the
inevitable results of keeping the standards of the I niversity high. Any
school that is worth the name says in effect to those who attend it. "Here
are the requirements we have established for the bachelor s. or any other,
degree. To get the degree you will have to fulfill them. 1 hey may seem
too strict or even absurd to you. I Jut if you come here, that is what you
will have to do."
Sometimes when studying becomes arduous it would seem much better
to just "slide through." Many times students have wished that this rule
or that regulation didn't have to be obeyed, lint when one is through and
looks back on his work, he will be glad that he was forced to a strict ad
herence to the rules.
