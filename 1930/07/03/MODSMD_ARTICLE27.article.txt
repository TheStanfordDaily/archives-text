# PITY THE POOR ATOM

### 
Man has often looked with envy upon the freedom of nature. To be
as free as an atom, unrestricted by laws and customs, has been the desire
of many. Little dn they realize that the atom, like man. has suffered
with the development of civilization down through the ages. It all started
with Lucretius, who called the atom the ultimate indivisible particle, but
gave it a verv vague social standing. Dalton, centuries later, restricted
its weights, while Avogardo established a law to control its actions under
certain conditions. It remained for Myer and Mendeleeft to bind it by
the periodic law just as man has been bound countless times.
Xot satisfied with mere restriction, the scientists now proceeded t<
tear the unoffending atom apart and search out its innermost private af
fairs. The atom was knocked back and forth by one scientist after an
other until finally Rutherford succeeded in removing an electron. 1 hus
following the precedent set by Congress in the affairs of man. they lei
1 lie whole world know that it had been masquerading under a false front
and showed that it was really made of protons and electrons.
The scientists again displayed the tendency of man to legislate by at
tempting to set up laws to control the home life of the atom. Bohr pro
ceeded to limit the movements of the electrons to fixed orbits, while Lewi?
and Langmuir arranged them about the nucleus in definite shapes. Thin
we see that the poor atom had lost that freedom that is so dear to all ol
us. I lowever. it was not to even have man's consolation of an establishe<
status. Along came Dellrolie and Slesinger to upset everything and place
the long suffering electrons in mere waves of probability. Surely th(
poor atom could stand no more.
Chicago has been the outstanding example of revolt against man mad<
laws. Therefore it is not surprising that the emancipation of the aton
finally came from that city. Compton of Chicago has freed the electron;
from many of the laws that restricted their movements. No longer an
they bound to regular paths but are thrown on tlieir own resources, fre<
to travel where they will. Perhaps some day the human race will be freer
in a similar manner from the multitude of laws that fetters its even
movement.
