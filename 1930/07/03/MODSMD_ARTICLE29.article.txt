I
Saw three girls* smoking on the
steps of the Libe just the other day. ,
. !
Are they trying to pose?
If women have to smoke why can't
they do it in the privacy of their chili
rooms?
We may hp old-fashioned, but we
don't like to see girls smoke in pub
lic places.
We always like to picture n woman
as something nicer than a man.
That's enough for this Sunday's ser
mon.
But remember the poser when you
see one.
Speaking of the library.
One of our Senior room-mates had
the embarrassment of his life when j
his father recently came to the camp
us for a visit.
He was miahle to point out the
library!
How to pass ih* time during sum- i
1 mer quarter—count all the arches in
the inner and outer quadrangles.

We might start a contest to see how
many persons can get Ihe correct
figure.

the Daily Californian.
We knew that TT.C. was large, but
how can they possibly have that many
j pipe courses?
But why put them in the museum?
What, do our rivals want with 300
! pipes?
I Who will smoke them?
Probably pass them out during lec
!tures.
Then again it may be some diaboli
cal scheme to retrieve the axe.

And now comes the summer quarter
girl that was so dumb that she thought
■ Mr. Beach was a nickname for Profes

j Speaking of dumbness.
We certainlv wish that some of
i
| these people that use the sacred halls
of study in the library were with our
j dead ancestors.
Our ancestors are keeping their
1 mouths shut.
Also these people who walk up and
down the aisles in the libe clicking
j their leather heels.
Rubber heels are 87.4% quieter and

j Another simile: As nervous as one
of the 500 waiting for her only date

We know now why the endurance
