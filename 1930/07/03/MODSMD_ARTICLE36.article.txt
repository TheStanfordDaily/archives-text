# INTERNATIONAL BANK WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ACCORDING TO BONN
## 
### 
"The international bank ought to be
a success, since it is backed by the
central bank of each country repre
sented, except in America, where it
is represented by J. P. Morgan, the
First. National Dank of Now York, and
First National flank of Chicago," is
the opinion of Professor Meritz J.
Hon 11 of the College of Commerce of
Berlin, who is acting professor of
Economics for the summer quarter.
The international bank is an out
growth of the Paris conference held
last year. It was at this conference
that Jackson E. Reynolds, Stanford
'OG, and president of the First Na
tional Bank of New York, was invited
to sit in on the session of the bank
charter committee, of which J. P.
Morgan and Owen 1). Young were the
United States representatives.
Shareholders to Receive Dividends
Professor Bonn said that the bank
was caused first by the need of some
.system for the handling of reparation
payments, and second, by the fact
that the fluctuation of foreign ex
change between countries will be less
ened by the intervention of tin bank.
The hank will be a success is Pro
lessor Bonn's belief, for not only will
there be large reparation payments,
Willi about live hundred million dol
lars a year being handled, but the
central banks of each country will
control it. Countries represented are
the IT, S., Britain, France, Belgium,
(jertnany, Italy, and Japan. The con
trolling banks can sell shares, but are"
not. obliged to do so, and the share
holders will receive dividends, but
have no votes.
No Need for Standardized Currency
On the subject of international cur
rency, Professor Bonn said that there
would be no pressing need for stan
dardization of currency. "There are so
many nrgerit international problems to
deal with; let's deal with those we
have to settle, and take our time about
the others," is his opinion. He ex
plained that the standard for all the
world is gold anyway; moreover the
value of money in countries with the
same currency varies.
"The money of England, for exam
ple, is the same as that in some of
her dominions, yet a pound sterling in
Australia frequently has less value
than a pound sterling in England, and
vice versa.""
