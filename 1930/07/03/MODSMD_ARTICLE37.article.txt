Lick Observatory is one of the best

world. It is under the direction of the
ITniversity of California and provided
with an endowment by its founder,
James Lick, whose tomb is in one of
the pillars supporting the big tele
scope. The party will return from the
Observatory after having an opportu
nity to look through one of the tele
scopes. Recently, several new astral
bodies have been identified by work
ers at. Mt. Hamilton.
Mt. Hamilton, where the Observa
tory is located, is* the most northern
extremity where the big-coned, or Coul
ter, pi tie trees are found. The cones
vary from ten to thirteen inches in
length and from pfive to seven and a
half inches in thickness. They are
the most massive borne by any pine.
The trees are very beautiful, being
tall and "long armed, with bunches of
cones near the tips of the main
branches.
