# M.A. Possibility in Four Years at Wisconsin
## Professor C.R. Fish Who Is Chairman Of Group Explains Plan 
### 
A Master of Art's degree in four j
! years is i<» be a possibility for supo- j
! rior students at the University of j
j Wisconsin, according to C. It. Fisli, ;
I acting professor of history during the |
j summer quarter. Extensive currieu
j lum changes are being made at Wis-
I consin by a committee of which Pro
| lessor Fish is chairman, for the. pur
j pose of raising I lie standard of student
I work.
At tlie end of the freshman year the
records of each member of the class
| will be considered from the stand
point of grades and grfcde points.
Students with entirely satisfactory re
! cords, probably about sixty-five per
cent of the group, will continue with- j
out question. Another fifteen pei cent ;
I witli insufficient grade points will be j
dropped from the University. The bal- j
ance, about twenty per cent, will be i
I I
advised to drop out or modify their )
line of work, depending on the indi-I
vidual case.
Special Examinations Given
"There will he an increase in the I
j use |of , examinations," ,l)r. I
J Fish explained. "Instead of being re- j
I quired to take a rounded program
!of lower division subjects as re
quired of Stanford freshmen and j
sophomores, members of the lower di- |
vision will be permitted to take ex
aminations in English, foreign lan
guage, mathematics, and natural sci
ence. Each student who satisfactorily
passes an examination in any field
will be excused from taking subjects
in that field. If the student is not pre- I
pared to take the examination or has ,
failed, he will register for thp usual
courses. An opportunity will probably
be siven each six months to take the
examinations."
"We have great hope that, this will ,
improve conditions in the class room,"
said Dr. Fish. "The students will feel 1
the need of the courses and the in- i
structors will be anxious to have their
students successfully pass the exam
inations.
"During the last 250 gears we have
gradually drawn away from the study ,
of philosophy. To supply this need a j
course is being started in philosophy, i
economics, and political science in :
which there will be a theoretical ap- !
proach to philosophy chiefly through
the reading of difficult material. At
flrst there is to be a limited number
taking the course but. we hope to
make it a sophomore requirement."
Some To Work Independently
The curriculum revision has not
been confined to the lower division
work but extends through all the uni
versity work, according to Prof. Fish, j
A student selects a general major like
Social Science, and, within that major,
a field of concentration as English
History. He is to be permitted to
spend half bis time doing work in the
field in which lie has elected to con
centrate.
During the senior year each student
will take a comprehensive examina
tion in his major subject. This ex
' animation will be partly oral and part
ly written.
Students of superior ability and pro
mise will be permitted to pursue their
studies under the Independent Study
Plan. At the end of four years the stu
dent will be permitted to take an ex
tremely comprehensive examination
!

tifies it, a Master of Arts degree will
be granted.
Special Courses Being Organized
Courses such as English history and
literature involving the co-operation
;of different departments are being
1 organized. The purpose is to develop
a unified view of related material and
! educate the instructors in different
I departments.
"However, I think it is a fallacy to
unite all Social Science under one
unit," Dr. Fish continued. "Differ
. ent sciences have different methods of
approach, and acquaintance with the
different methods make the educated
, man today. It is impossible for any
individual to be acquainted with all
' the various branches of Social Science.
! This is unnecessary if he understands
| the method of economics, of history,
i of' psychology.
Students Favor Plan
"The number of freshman and sopho
more students will probably remain
about the same but there will be a
j reduction of upper classmen.
"The students are unanimously in
favor of the system. Even those who
I are dropped are satisfied with the year
or two of work in the University and
! recognize the fairness of the system."
Students who are dropped at the
I end of the sophomore year can re
present their case after a year's ab
' sence. Dr. Fish believes that a year
of work often stabilizes a youns man
or woman and they return to the uni
versity with a greater appreciation of
their opportunity and a serious pur
: pose.

I quired to take a rounded program
!of lower division subjects as re
quired of Stanford freshmen and j

vision will be permitted to take ex
aminations in English, foreign lan
guage, mathematics, and natural sci
ence. Each student who satisfactorily
passes an examination in any field
will be excused from taking subjects
in that field. If the student is not pre- I
pared to take the examination or has ,
failed, he will register for thp usual
courses. An opportunity will probably
be siven each six months to take the
examinations."
"We have great hope that, this will ,
improve conditions in the class room,"
said Dr. Fish. "The students will feel 1
the need of the courses and the in- i
structors will be anxious to have their

inations.
"During the last 250 gears we have
gradually drawn away from the study ,
of philosophy. To supply this need a j
course is being started in philosophy, i
economics, and political science in :
which there will be a theoretical ap- !
proach to philosophy chiefly through
the reading of difficult material. At
flrst there is to be a limited number

said Dr. Fish. "The students will feel 1
the need of the courses and the in- i
structors will be anxious to have their
students successfully pass the exam
inations.
"During the last 250 gears we have
gradually drawn away from the study ,
of philosophy. To supply this need a j
course is being started in philosophy, i
economics, and political science in :
which there will be a theoretical ap- !
proach to philosophy chiefly through
the reading of difficult material. At
flrst there is to be a limited number
taking the course but. we hope to
make it a sophomore requirement."
Some To Work Independently
The curriculum revision has not
been confined to the lower division
work but extends through all the uni
versity work, according to Prof. Fish, j
A student selects a general major like
Social Science, and, within that major,
a field of concentration as English
History. He is to be permitted to
spend half bis time doing work in the
field in which lie has elected to con
centrate.
During the senior year each student
will take a comprehensive examina
tion in his major subject. This ex
' animation will be partly oral and part
ly written.
Students of superior ability and pro
mise will be permitted to pursue their
studies under the Independent Study
Plan. At the end of four years the stu
dent will be permitted to take an ex
tremely comprehensive examination
!
present a thesis. If the work jus
tifies it, a Master of Arts degree will
be granted.
Special Courses Being Organized
Courses such as English history and
literature involving the co-operation
;of different departments are being
1 organized. The purpose is to develop
a unified view of related material and
! educate the instructors in different
I departments.
"However, I think it is a fallacy to
unite all Social Science under one
unit," Dr. Fish continued. "Differ
. ent sciences have different methods of
approach, and acquaintance with the
different methods make the educated
, man today. It is impossible for any
individual to be acquainted with all
' the various branches of Social Science.
! This is unnecessary if he understands
| the method of economics, of history,
i of' psychology.
Students Favor Plan
"The number of freshman and sopho
more students will probably remain
about the same but there will be a
j reduction of upper classmen.
"The students are unanimously in
favor of the system. Even those who
I are dropped are satisfied with the year
or two of work in the University and
! recognize the fairness of the system."
Students who are dropped at the
I end of the sophomore year can re
present their case after a year's ab
' sence. Dr. Fish believes that a year
of work often stabilizes a youns man
or woman and they return to the uni
versity with a greater appreciation of
their opportunity and a serious pur
: pose.
