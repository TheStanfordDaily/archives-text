# Suzzallo's Appointment to Carnegie Foundation Praised by Cubberley
## 
### 
"They could not have selected a bet- j
ter man," says Dr. E. P. Cubberley,
dean of the School of Education, in j
speaking of Dr. Henry Suzzallo, Stan
ford graduate, who has recently been
appointed president of the Carnegie
i Foundation for the Advancement of
! Teaching.
"Dr. Suzzallo is eminently fitted
for his new position, and is as well
acquainted as any man with the col-

leges and universities of the country.
Since the Carnegie Foundation is con
cerned with teachers' pensions and in
surance for teachers, this knowledge
is especially valuable."
