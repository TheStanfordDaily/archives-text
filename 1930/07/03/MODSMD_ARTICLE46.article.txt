# STANFORD CLASS HOLDS MEETINGS IN TOWN HALL
## 
### 
One "different" class of the sum
mer quarter is Lliat dealing with pub
lic health administration and taught
by Health Officer Louis Olsen of Palo
Alto. It meets in the health depart
ment of the Palo Alto city hall. This
is done, Mr. Olsen says, to get the at
mosphere of a working health unit
rather than the college classroom.
The course was designed originally
for public health nurses. Later it was
opened to others because of a demand
for the work. Nurses ordinarily take
the course at the school for nurses in
San Francisco.
"Palo Alto has one of the finest
small community health departments
in the country," says Dr. W. H. Brown,
professor of hygiene in (he univer
siiy. Health Officer Olsen has been
with this department since 1!Â»17 and
is credited with being in no small
way responsible for its success. The
local Health Department was organ
ized in 1902-3 when an epidemic of
typhoid fever visited the community.
Thai year 236 cases were reported in
a community of 3500 people. The peo
ple realized that there was desperate
need for organization and as a result,
the present department was developed.
Ai present the department consists
of the health officer, two full-time in
spectors, two full-time nurses, a full
time laboratory worker, and a clerk.
Accurate check is kept on such things
as communicable diseases, vital sta
tistics, location of all houses, maps
showing location of animals, and a
separate map for dogs alone. The
dogs number about an even thousand
in I lie residence district of Palo Alto.
