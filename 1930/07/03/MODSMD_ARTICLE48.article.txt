# Stanford Education Student Will Study Junior College Problems
## 
### 
Tlie $2,500 fellowship award re
cently made to Wyatt W. Male, Stan
ford graduate student, is the largest
fellowship grant in Education in the
United States, or in the world. Phi
Delta Kappa, education fraternity,
granted the fellowship to Hale to
ward, his research work for the de
gree of doctor of philosophy. The re
search will be a year's study of the
junior college.
Mr. Hale, a graduate of the Bir
lninghani Southern college, has been a
graduate student at both Johns Hop
kins University and Stanford. At pres
ent he is on leave from the Birming
ham Southern college where lie con
tinues to hold the position of Regis
trar and assistant to the President.
Because of the unexcelled opportunity
to study junior colleges in California
and because of the strength of the
faculty in the field junior college
study, he chose Stanford University
as the best location to begin his study
of the junior colleges and their contri
bution to our education system, Mr.
Hale is working under the immedi
ate supervision of Dr. Walter C. Eells,
professor in the Stanford School of
Education and editor-in-chief of the
Junior College Journal.
Professor Eells Pleased
"Mr. Hale has been at Stanford for
a year during which he has shown
very unusual capacity for research
work," states Professor Eells. "I
feel very much gratified that the Na
tional Fraternity has seen fit to recog
nize in this way the extent of the in
vestigation in the junior college field
lie proposes to carry on. The recog
nition lie has earned is a reflection on
the Stanford School of Education."
Junior college graduates of the past
three years will be studied in connec
tion with their advanced work in uni
versities and four-year colleges, with
particular reference to their success
or failure in advanced work and the
reasons for such success or failure, so
far as it is possible to determine the
reasons. A second phase of the re
search, perhaps a primary reason for
the study, will be to determine the
relative effectiveness of the junior
college organization as a unit in our
educational system.
Topic Important to Educators
The expansion of junior colleges in
number and size makes the topic chos- |
en and the field of study under inves
tigation of growing concern to edu
cators the country over. Laymen who :
would be informed on the pros and
cons of educational procedure and or
ganization are interested, as are high i

| scliool graduates who must decide
! upon tlie typo of institution wliicli will
!afford the best opportunities for lay
' ing the foundation of a higher educa*
| tion.
Hale will have the co-operation of
i the American Association of Junior
i Colleges, the American Association of
i Collegiate Registrars, the United
1 States Office of Education junior
! colleges tlie country over, and univer
j sities and four-year colleges to which
I the junior college graduates have
j gone. The School of Education lias al
j ready agreed to issue and distribute
i 70,000 pieces of printed matter which
j tiie investigation calls for. The lind
! ings of the study will be incorporated
| in the report of the committee now at
j work on a national survey of second
jary education under the direction of
| Commissioner William John Cooper
! and Professor L. V. Koos of the Uni
versity of Chicago.
Questions to Be Investigated
Some of the questions on which ihis
investigation will attempt to throw
light are as follows: What per cent
jof junior college graduates continue
j their education in universities or four
year colleges? How do junior college
| graduates compare with other stu-
I dents in their advanced college work?
| Do the best graduates continue for a
I higher education or do they stop? To
! what type of institution do the junior
, college graduates go for their ad
vanced work? How do the graduates
lof junior colleges rate quality of in
jstruetion in comparison with that re
i reived in higher institutions? Dp the
J graduates of junior colleges feel that
j attendance at junior college placed
â– them at any disadvantage in compari
j visions of universities and four-year
l son with those who attended lower di
j colleges for their first two years' work
in college? Would junior college grad
uates, if given free choice in repeat
ing college work and experience
i choose junior college in preference to
lower divisions of higher institutions,
for their first two years of college)
work ?
Award Unanimous
The award was unanimously made ;
to Hale by a committee of educators
representing all sections of llie United
States except the West. The award
was not limited to members of the
fraternity.
The Stanford School of Education '
had already expressed its approval of ,
Jlale's work by awarding iiiui the Cub-,
berlev Fellowship. This fellowship is j
not made vacant by Hale's acceptance !
of tiie Phi Delta Kappa award.
