"A man can be destroyed, but not an j
{educational method," said Professor
j Kdward Maslin Hulme in bis lecture ]
I on the "Life of Abelard," given yester- !
j day afternoon in the Little Theatre.
| "Abelard seemed designed to be a
: knight. Instead lie became an intel
j lectual kniglit who went forth in
j search of educational and scholastic
I adventures."
i Professor Hulme gave a graphic
J description of the Latin Quarter of
| Paris, city of students, in the middle
j ages. The Latin requirements of the
• cathedral schools, which he depleted,
j forced the students to talk in Latin
j all the time, thus giving the name to
j the student district. Spies were em
| ployed to report any breach of the
! rule.
Professor Hulme told of the large
I number of students in the time of
' Abelard who worked unaided to pay
j for their education. "At thu present
: time, however, there are very few stu-
I dents in Continental schools who work
I their way," he said.
"Abelard, who went to Hie cathedral
; school of Notre Dame, was a coneep-
Itionist in debate," continued Professor
I Hulme. "He later led the students in
| the study of philosophy. Thousands
j flocked to hear him from all over
j western liurope.
"Abelard was romantic, dramatic,
land revolutionary. Hut lie was rcvolu-
J tionary in method, not in thought. Kor
{this introduction of new ideas and
j doubt of dogmatic statements of the
' time, he led a short life. He was exe
| cuted while .still quite young."
In speaking of Abelard's inlroduc
j lion of the idea of inquiry in educa
• tlon, Professor Hulme concluded with
tbi! .statement, "On the sea of life,
there is only one sure guide and that
i is independent intellect and indepen
-1 dent consiousness."
