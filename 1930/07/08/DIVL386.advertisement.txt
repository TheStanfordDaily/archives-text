IF YOU enjoy smoking, why not smoke the most enjoyable
cigarette ever made? Camels are made for pleasure . . .
nothing else! The best of all the pleasure-giving goodness
of choicest tobaccos —all of the delicately delightful
qualities of mellow, sun-ripened Turkish and Domestic
tobaccos are blended here in a perfect harmony of
fragrance and flavor.
Here, in the smoking of Camels, is one of the honest plea
sures that have been added to life. It's all yours. Enjoy it.
