## Nation's Intellectual Drifts Today Is Combination Of Real and Spiritual People Advancing Rapidly In Social Relations And Scientific Thought 
### 
"The main intellectual trend in
present-day Germany is ;i blend of
(he sense of reality with an apprecia
tion of the value of the spiritual urge."
This is the opinion of Dr. Camillo
von Klenze, acting professor of Ger
man, who will lecture tonight in the
Little Theatre on the "Intellectual
and Social Currents in Present-Day
Germany."
That Germany is making remark
able progress both in social relations
and in scientific thought is the belief
ol' Dr. von Klenze. Although burdened
with war debts and without sufficient
funds for research, German scientists,
he declared, are making important
contributions to modern scientific
thought.
Dr. von Klenze said that Germany
was realistic before the war. They
were too practical. Now they realize
that a nation must, have something
else besides efficient armies and big
guns. The war has taught them that
spiritual values are important.
Dr. von Klenze is honorary proles- !
sor of American literature at the Uni- J
versity of Munich. He lias taught j
German language and literature at I
several universities in this country |
since receiving his A.B. degree from |
Harvard in 188(5.
