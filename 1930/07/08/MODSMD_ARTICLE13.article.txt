# COMPOSER OF "DON QUIXOTE" ATTENDS SYMPHONY CONCERT
## 
### 
Interest was added to Sunday's
symphony concert by the presence of
Gastone Usigli, composer of the Sym
phonic Scherzo, "Don Quixote," which
was played for the second time in
America by the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra at Hillsborough un
der the direction of Bernardino Mo
! linari.
At the conclusion of the "Don
Quixote" the composer was applauded
by an enthusiastic audience as he
walked across the stage to be con
gratulated by Molinari. Usigli is a
graduate of the Conservatory of
i Venice at Bologna. He is now a resi
i dent of San Francisco where lie is
j associated with the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music.
"Bolero" Was Sensational
Ravel's "Bolero" was the most
sensational selection on the program.
The peculiarity of the melodic and
rhythmic structure, which was un
changed throughout the entire com
position, was prevented from becom
| ing monotonous by varied orchestral
I development.
Classic as well as modern compo
sitions were played by the orchestra.
Opening the program was the Egmont
Overture, which is one of Beethoven's
well-known shorter compositions.
The second selection to be played
Sunday was the Brahms Fourth Sym
phony. This number is noted for being
the last composition which the com
poser conducted before his death in
1879.
