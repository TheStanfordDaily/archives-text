# REHEARSALS FOR PYGMALION NEAR GRATIFYING END
## Satisfaction With Work Of Actors Is Expressed Bv Director Helvenston Cockney Accent Is Featured In Shaw's Comedy; Mob Has Individual Motif 
### 
" 'Pygmalion' lias advanced in re
hearsal to a state of perfection far
beyond what could he expected," au
nounced Harold llelvenston, director,
as lie expressed his satisfaction to the
Daily yesterday."The characters, so
far, have played their roles with ex
cellence, and I feel sure that, if neces
sary, I could present the piece tomor
row without discredit.
"Katherine Keho and David Lam
son are to be especially complimented
upon their mastery of the cockney ac
cent; which pervades the play. They
deliver this accent, I believe, as well
as any amateur American actor." Hel
venston also expressed satisfaction
concerning the performance of Irving
Rosenblatt and the realisticnoss of
the mob which, he remarked, "was not
a plastic group but a varied, conglom
erate crowd of individuals."
Shaw Takes Flings
In "Pygmalion" Shaw shows th«
difficulty of teaching anyone to spcafc
English correctly through his charac
ters, Eliza Doolittle, played by Kath
erine Keho; Henry Higgins, portrayed
by Irving Rosenblatt; and Colonel
Pickering, the line old gentleman who
has been interested in phonetics all
his life from the angle of Indian dia
lects, taken by Herbert Wenig.
David Lamson takes the part of
Alfred Doolittle, a typical representa
tive of the undeserving poor, whose
problem is developed in this Shaw
comedy. Shaw also takes a dig at the
class system in England through the
three impoverished but genteel mem
bers of the Eynsford Hill family,
played by Claire Pearce, Gertrude
Neill, and Henry Adams. Mrs. Hig
gins, a true gentlewoman and mother
of Henry Higgins, will be depicted by
Catherine Crary.
Has Unusual Endings
In "Pygmalion" the audience will
quickly observe that Shaw thinks of
every woman as an individual. Henry
Higgins, the phonetic expert, is the
mirror through which one gains in
sight into the Shavian views of wo
men. Eliza Doolittle is his creation
even as Galatea was the creation of
Pygmalion in the old Greek myth in
which the beautiful statue was
brought to life through the love and
inspiration of its sculptor. Shaw found
the source for his play in this legend.
Throughout, the play there are the
clever touches of Shaw's sparkling
wit. There is ;i very unusual ending
to the comedy.

venston also expressed satisfaction
concerning the performance of Irving
Rosenblatt and the realisticnoss of
the mob which, he remarked, "was not
a plastic group but a varied, conglom
erate crowd of individuals."
Shaw Takes Flings
In "Pygmalion" Shaw shows th«
difficulty of teaching anyone to spcafc
English correctly through his charac
ters, Eliza Doolittle, played by Kath
erine Keho; Henry Higgins, portrayed
by Irving Rosenblatt; and Colonel
Pickering, the line old gentleman who
has been interested in phonetics all
his life from the angle of Indian dia
lects, taken by Herbert Wenig.
David Lamson takes the part of
Alfred Doolittle, a typical representa
tive of the undeserving poor, whose
problem is developed in this Shaw
comedy. Shaw also takes a dig at the
class system in England through the
three impoverished but genteel mem
bers of the Eynsford Hill family,
played by Claire Pearce, Gertrude
Neill, and Henry Adams. Mrs. Hig
gins, a true gentlewoman and mother
of Henry Higgins, will be depicted by
Catherine Crary.
Has Unusual Endings
In "Pygmalion" the audience will
quickly observe that Shaw thinks of
every woman as an individual. Henry
Higgins, the phonetic expert, is the
mirror through which one gains in
sight into the Shavian views of wo
men. Eliza Doolittle is his creation
even as Galatea was the creation of
Pygmalion in the old Greek myth in
which the beautiful statue was
brought to life through the love and
inspiration of its sculptor. Shaw found
the source for his play in this legend.
Throughout, the play there are the
clever touches of Shaw's sparkling
wit. There is ;i very unusual ending
to the comedy.
