# MALONE TO SPEAK ON CONFUCIUS IN WEDNESDAY LECTURE
## 
### 
"Confucius, China's ideal gentle
man and scholar," says Professor Car
roll R. Malone, who lias chosen that
figure for liis lecture which is to be
given at 4:15 Wednesday afternoon
in the Little Theatre, "is the George
Washington of his country. Highly re
spected, in many cases worshiped by
(lie people, he is, nevertheless, re
garded as an aristocrat.
"Some of the 'Young Doubters' con
sider the political and moral codes of
Confucius as being out of date, and
thus they seek the overthrow of Con
fucian culture. The atheists of China
are more numerous, serious, and in
tense than are those of our own coun
try. They wish to substitute for Con
fucianism some form of a personal
political religion, anarchism, commun
ism, or moderate socialism.
"Confucius really considered him
self not a religious leader, but a
teacher of political morality; it was
his followers, against, the will of the
man, who later gave him his present
religious aspect. We have an interest
ing problem when we attempt to ac
count for the long life of Chinese
civilization. No other country contem
porary with ancient Babylon and As
syria is still existing. The theories of
Confucius, which for the past 2500
years have had an outstanding influ
ence on Chinese thought and culture,
will perhaps help us explain the ques
t ion."
Professor Malone taught history for
.sixteen years at Tsing llau College in
China. He has also instructed at Deni
son, Ohio State, and Miami unversi
ties and at Oberlin College.
