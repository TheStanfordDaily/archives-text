# "A STEIN ON THE TABLE..."
## 
### 
Dusty and neglected, two capacious l steins stand on a side shelf in a
fraternity house on the campus, now open to hoarders. The most cursory
examination will reveal that they have long l>ecn empty. These carefully
designed mugs meant to grace a jolly table are now merely questionable
obji'ts d'art.
This is not a roundabout way of introducing an argument against the
eighteenth amendment. It is, rather, an expression of regret for the days
of rollicking stein songs (this is not ballyhoo, either, for Rudy Yallee's
late offering) and boisterous good humor. Maybe that is a musical
comedy idea of former student life. Maybe we of the younger generation
are glossing with sentiment times that were really coarse and vulgar.
l'.e that as it may, there is something lacking in student life these days.
We don't sing enough. We don't converse enough. Kating is a rather
pleasant duty, but it must be got through with as rapidly as possible.
I here are too many places to go to, and it's too easy to get to them.
In the days of steins, we have been taught to believe, students would
spend; long hours at a table eating, talking, singing, and drinking. Con
vivial. boti vivaiits, they had a student life that was distinct from the
pressing surge of the market place. They were a homogeneous group
isolated by their interests from the rest of the world.
I'ccausc of Stanford's location, because the I'niversity and its people
are detached, in a way, from other communities, here on the I "arm, there
is much better chance to maintain a distinct university life. Stanford
spirit and Stanford traditions arc more than mere words. They are evi
dent even to the diversified group of summer quarter students.
Let's hope that the day will never come when Stanford will become
just a big, efficient institution turning out with mechanical regularity its
quota of graduates. Above all, let's hope that Stanford students will
insi>t on maintaining a distinctive student life.
