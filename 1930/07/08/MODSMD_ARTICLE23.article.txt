# EARTHQUAKE AS A BENEFACTOR
## 
### 
There are only a few persons on tlie campus today who remember
1 lie earthquake disaster of 1906. Passing the entrance to the campus
today, those who were here in 1900 have doubtless been struck bv the
resemblance to the same spot immediately after the earthquake.
Man and not nature has been responsible this time for the piles of
stone that lie there. The powers that be have decreed that the University
is to have a new and more imposing main entrance. Where the forces of
nature once worked destruction the forces of man will soon be at work
to build anew. While the widening of the highway will necessitate the
placing of the entrance farther back on Palm Drive, the plans call for
essentially the same type ot entrance that stood before the earthquake.
I'or those who like beauty as well as utility in their buildings the
earthquake of 1000 was an act of (lod in more ways than one. The
principal buildings that were destroyed were the partially completed
library and the gymnasium. Comparison of our present beautiful library
building with the one that was being built then, and of the men's gym
of today with the one that was thrown down arouses something like
gratitude to the earthquake, 100 bad, of course, to have anv building
ruined â€”but still, look at the assembly hall of today and perhaps you
will be sorry that the earthquake didn't reach a little further in its
destructiveness.
After twenty-four years, during which remnants of the former main
entrance have served as an unimpressive gateway, the old design is
revived and improved and we shall once more have an adequate front
door to the campus. So that even here the University gains architec
turally by the earthquake's selections for ruin.
