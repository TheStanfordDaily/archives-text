The subject is trite. Hut so many teachers scurry around the Quad,
books piled brows furrowed, often showing evidence of long hours
of study, that it seems worthwhile once more to point out that not least
unions the qualities a teacher should take to the classroom is enthusiasm.
Knthusiasm is a product of vitality, and hard study at the University,
with no relief, will sap one's vitalitv.
Of course, spending one's vacation attending school is admirable.
Superintendents, principals, and teachers who do that show the right
attitude toward their profession. Such people, no doubt, will be the
ones who will climb the highest.
The danger is that after spending nine or ten months in the office or
classroom and then spending ten weeks in undermining study at college
they will return to their work "fagged out." In one sense there is such a
thing as studying too hard.
Many opportunities for recreation are available on the campus. We
can think of no legitimate reason why an hour during the day or several
hours over the week-end could not be used by everyone. The rewards
in the form of renewed zenl for studies, to sa\ nothing of actual physical
well being, are worth working for.
