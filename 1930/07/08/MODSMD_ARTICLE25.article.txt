Despite all the precautions against
'firecrackers, some did show up Satur
day with bandages around t heir
fingers. Folks are like that.
Now that the Fourth of July is over
with we can settle down and dress our
wounds.
And hury the dead.
Our Senior roommate broke It is leg
on the Fourth.
After lighting a firecracker lie threw
| the match in a manhole.
And stepped on it.
Guess we'll have to shoot him.

In one of last week's Palo Alto
Times-we see that a vocalist "sank
two solos."
Sort of a "Down to the Sea in Ships"
idea.
The singer probably knew best
I wliat to do with the songs.
Still, sinking two solos in one pro
gram is worth a sentence in a news
paper.
People 1 hate.
The fellow who continually shouts
| in your ear.
4 out of 5 have the habit,
I It isn't exactly an insidious habit
but it IS annoying.
i Blas£ senior on the Quad
! Passed a freshman with a nod.
Said the freshman, "Say, big fellow,
Ain't, you learned yet to say hello?"
Said tlie senior, "Oh, my g-goodness!"
The accent of "hello" on the first
i syllable is, of course, by poetic li
i cense. It's sickening, the license these
: kids take, protected by the absence
!of freshman discipline at Stanford.
But don't understand us as defend
ing t lie senior's Stanford manners.
Assuredly not.
He was probably a transfer, any
how.
Avoid that last-minute shopping
ru.^h.
Do your Christmas Shopping Early.
Only 169 days left.
"Champaign Man Better Following
Car Crash," says a headline. We would
; suppose the wear and tear would be
| terrifiic.

| Maybe a car crash would do won-
Iders for the Cabbages column. Says
I you.

Said a Stanford man in applying for
J a position as a Cook's guide, "1 have
I directed 13,333 tourists to Hoover's
| home." He got the job.
And deserved it.
Got a new game for between classes
during summer quarter.
It's called license-plate poker.
You sit on the curb and note the
out-of-state cars that come on the
campus and pick your hand from th<*
numbers appearing on the license
plate .The first player takes the first
car and the second player takes the
second, and so on.
If the first car had the New York
license of 3H43-G2 and the second hud
|an Alabama license of 53-46-29, the
second "hand" would win the pot. Ex
planation: The first "hand" contained
a pair of "'s and Uih second "hand" a
straight—2, 3, 4, 5, G. The figure one
counts as ace and zeros are wild. So
the "hand" of lll2.'»-oi would be three
aces.
And so oti far down the highway.
"Men without women" sounds like
another dastardly plot to abolish the
; fair five hundred.
After glancing over those old edi
torials on the Roble lockout system,
| Sleepy Sam wants to know if Editor
; Speers is the author of that poem
j which begins—"Onward rode the noble
j five hundred, onward into the jaws
of death."
Speaking of endurance flights.
I
| Think of the possibilities of college
j students using them for necking; par
ties.
It would combine the advantages of
being alone and also of no interrup
tion.
Here is a marvelous opportunity for
some enterprising student.
I'll wager none of the 500 is asked
1 lo go on the flight.
1
It's too bad that there isn't more
of the 500 here.
We could have more to poke fun at.
Really girls, don't mind us. This is
the traditional pose. Doesn't mean
I anything. You're our girls and we love
I you.
