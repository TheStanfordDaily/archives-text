"THE LAST MILE"—GEARY
(By the Reviewer)
You've heard a great deal of gulf
about "experiences in the theater."
Well, here IS one, and no two ways
| about it."The Last Mile" is the raw
est, cruellest, deepest slice out of the
i harsh side of life yet presented on
i the .stage. It is an ordeal in the thea
j ter, more than a mere experience, and
yet it is an ordeal which draws a
willing sufferance from the audience.
Curtain goes up on "The Last Mile"
and a row of seven iron-barred cells
; face the audience. It is a murderer's
row where seven men await electro
cution. The first act is entirely
concerned with the fearful mental
agony of one boy who is going to the
chair that day. The climax of horror
is reached when the dull hum of the
dynamo is heard and the lights go dim
! in Condemned Row —twice. " !"
: cries "Killer" Mears, "What're they
trying to do —cook him?"'
Mears later becomes a demon, and
I before he walks to death at the last
I curtain has deliberately murdered two
, men before your eyes when the war
i den fails to comply with his demands.
Clark Gable as Mears is great. Ed
ward Woods carries the first act on
his shoulders as the doomed youth.
I In spite of the contrast between the
: psychological terror of the first act,
land the fearful movement of the final

[one, "The Last Mile" is wonderfully
well-knit. Furthermore, its "message,"
if it lias one, is carried purely in the
wave of its own action. It is never
propaganda. It does not have to lie.
"REBOUND"—CURRAN
This pleasantry can be dismissed in
fewer words than "The Last Mile"
j simply because it is far less signifi
cant. "Rebound" is Donald Ogden
Stewart's witty story of how a smart
girl, witli a slight quirk of an in
feriority complex, turns down an ap
pealing sort of guy who is her pal in
order to marry an egotist, whom per
haps she loves. Ina Claire is playing
it charmingly. She has a crisp, clipped
style of delivery which points her most
casual remark for a chuckle.
But "Rebound" is a psychological
comedy, and that is where it drops,
finally, so that the last act is less
amusing than the first and therefore
seems less logical. This man Stewart
is the same one who wrote the utterly
nutty story of "Mr. and Mrs. Haddock
Abroad," and so "Rebound" is most
enjoyable where lie writes light,
slightly goofy satire.
Incidentally, Robert Williams is a
very new type of juvenile—easy-going,
off-hand, and always interesting. Lex
Lindsay as Bill, the egotist, is the
standard type, but pretty good any
how. —G. S.
