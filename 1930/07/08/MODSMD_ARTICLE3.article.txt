# LATEST HOOVER BIOGRAPHY GIVES UNUSUAL SIDELIGHTS
## 
### 
New and unusual slants on the life
of Herbert Hoover are presented in
his latest biography. Issued just a few
days ago, this new life of the Presi
dent lias already attracted nationwide
attention. Written by William J.
Marsh Jr., of New Milford, Conn., it
i lias set new standards for biography.
! The author, not content with the mere
writing of such a monumental work,
printed the entire book on his own
printing press. Although only eleven
years old and due to enter the sixth
grade this year, the writer handles
] his subject in an interesting and
| wholesome manner.
Less than a year ago a New Jersey
antique dealer purchased, among
other things, an ancient and decrepit
printing press. While he pondered
I whether to place it in his shop as one
j of Franklin's original presses or to
! throw it back on the junk pile, the
! press caught the eye of his son. Hence
j young Marsh set up a job-printing
| plant and as he says in the preface
to his book,
"This worked well and 1 done a
real good business. I was then ten
years old; now I am eleven."
Like any other business man he
was faced with labor troubles and,
he continues, "I am taking my brother,
Charles, in as my partner and helper,
he is only nine, and not very fond of
work, he would rather sit around and
write music, lie says some day he will
be a good writer." I

The small volume, neatly bound and
printed on pale blue paper, is quaintly
illustrated with old woodcuts that ex
press the author's ideas on various
subjects. The writer has not felt him
self limited to biography and often
digresses to moralize. Prohibition and
the position of women are among the
subjects that are handled effectively
as t lie following selections will show.
"I think that women should stop
serving wine at their parties.. They
j are the ones who can make our coun
j try dry. When a woman makes up her
! mind to do a thing, as a general rule
I she does it."
"A good mother don't spend her
| time at dances and parties, she helps
; her children with their school work,
j she makes their home a happy one."
; History of American Flag Introduced
The biographical matter is handled
j in an engaging manner. A history of
| tiie American flag is the introduction
| to the birth of the President. Ample
j space is devoted to the various phases
!of Hoover's life. Perhaps the most
j interesting and refreshing portions
| are devoted to the President's days
at Stanford. From these has been se
j lected one which throws new light on
| a famous Stanford romance.
! "It was at this University that Mr.
| Hoover met his wife, Miss Lou Henry.
}Miss Henry was a beautiful girl, she
fwas like Mr. Hoover; she was very
i fond of out-of-door sports, she was
very fond of horses and was consid
! ered a very good rider.
"When she first went to the Uni
versity, she heard the hoys talking so
much about a boy by the. name of
Herbert Hoover, so sin* like moat all
the girls was very anxious to see what
kind of a looking person he was. Do
you know girls are very curious just
mention a fellow's name a few times,
|
(and you are sure of Retting the nirls
interested. I nuess it was just this
! way in this case too. So one day he
| happened tn meet Miss Henry in one
lof the Professor's offices. 1 guess it
was just luck for both, for I hear the
) women say Mrs. Hoover is just the
woman for the White House."
Six months were required to com
i plete the book. However, young Marsh
| no doubt felt that it was well worth
j the labor when the other day lie re
j ceived an order from the President
I for a copy.

Less than a year ago a New Jersey
antique dealer purchased, among
other things, an ancient and decrepit
printing press. While he pondered
I whether to place it in his shop as one
j of Franklin's original presses or to
! throw it back on the junk pile, the
! press caught the eye of his son. Hence
j young Marsh set up a job-printing
| plant and as he says in the preface
to his book,
"This worked well and 1 done a
real good business. I was then ten
years old; now I am eleven."
Like any other business man he
was faced with labor troubles and,
he continues, "I am taking my brother,
Charles, in as my partner and helper,
he is only nine, and not very fond of
work, he would rather sit around and
write music, lie says some day he will
be a good writer." I

The small volume, neatly bound and
printed on pale blue paper, is quaintly
illustrated with old woodcuts that ex
press the author's ideas on various
subjects. The writer has not felt him
self limited to biography and often
digresses to moralize. Prohibition and
the position of women are among the
subjects that are handled effectively
as t lie following selections will show.
"I think that women should stop
serving wine at their parties.. They
j are the ones who can make our coun
j try dry. When a woman makes up her
! mind to do a thing, as a general rule
I she does it."
"A good mother don't spend her
| time at dances and parties, she helps
; her children with their school work,
j she makes their home a happy one."
; History of American Flag Introduced
The biographical matter is handled
j in an engaging manner. A history of
| tiie American flag is the introduction
| to the birth of the President. Ample
j space is devoted to the various phases
!of Hoover's life. Perhaps the most
j interesting and refreshing portions
| are devoted to the President's days
at Stanford. From these has been se
j lected one which throws new light on
| a famous Stanford romance.

}Miss Henry was a beautiful girl, she
fwas like Mr. Hoover; she was very

"When she first went to the Uni

much about a boy by the. name of
