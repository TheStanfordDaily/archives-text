# "GO YE AND LEARN" IS TEXT OF ARCHDEACON IN SUNDAY SERMON
## 
### 
"Go Ye and Learn What This
Means" was the text of the sermon
by the Venerable Archdeacon Porter
of San Francisco at tlie service in
Memorial Church Sunday morning.
The text is taken from the Gospel ac
cording to St. Matthew.
"The modern school, high school,
and university," said Archdeacon Por
ter, "all exist for the purpose of aid
ing the student physically, morally,
and socially in the schoolhouse of the
world. Some of us have eyes and ears,
yet do not see nor hear â€”don't know
how to appreciate."
He questioned whether a musical
instrument belongs to the man who
buys it, installs it, and hires someone
to play on it, and ended by saying
that the ownership of an organ is in
the melody-haunted soul who may
have wandered into a church to rest
and is listening to the practicing or
ganist.
"World ownership," according to
Archdeacon Porter, "is mainly u mat
ter of the capacity to appreciate, to
use, and to enjoy."
