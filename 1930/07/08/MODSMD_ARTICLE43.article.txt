# TEACHERS SHOULD REGISTER NOW AT APPOINTMENT OFFICE
## 
### 
"All teachers attending . Stanford
this summer quarter, whether experi
enced or inexperienced, whether in
search of a position or not, should
register at the Appointment Office,"
advises Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, appoint
ment secretary. The office maintains
a permanent personnel record service,
and is ready to help at some future
date those teachers who are not look
ing for a position now.
In order to complete the records and
to avoid the late quarter rush, teach
ers are urged to register at the office i
;is soon us possible. Mere registration J
;is a student of Stanford entitles them |
to this privilege, and no especial num- I
her of unit hours is required.
Mrs. Irene Spenner, who is in charge (
of student employment at the Appoint
ment Office, has found that jobs are !
unusually scarce this summer, due to I
the general financial depression of
the country. "Fewer students have
applied this quarter than any quarter
Miice 1 have been here," she said.
Most of the regular students have
1 oniid it necessary to find full time
jobs this summer instead of going to
school.
"A smaller number of resorts and
ramps are running than usual," con- !
tinued Mrs. Spenner. "There is less!
demand for manual labor or work on I
buildings. These have always been the j
greatest source of collegiate summer 1
positions before.
"Despite the scarcity of jobs, liovv- j
ever, it lias been very difficult to find
students to work for board and room.
The coterie of teachers, who form an 1
especially large part of the student [
body (his summer, prefer no employ- ;
ment in any other than the academic j
line."
