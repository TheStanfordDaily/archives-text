### 
Every year the freshmen, God
I bless their little hearts, are railed at
for various and sundry Reasons. They
discard dinks, queen, and show a com
plete absence of class spirit. They do
| everything except smoke on the Quad.
Verily, the inmates of Encina lead a
life of sin.
The summer quarter freshman is an
| even queerer kind of duck than the
"rah-rah boys" of the regular quarter.
Instead of being segregated, as lie
properly should be, he is interspersed
i among the upperelassmen in Toyon
land the grads in the Union. How
popular with their neighbors are these
frosh, particularly the ones who are
taking public speaking!
Among the proteges we find winners
jof oratorical contests in thirty-three
distinct counties. Those who aren't
orators are equally prominent in
their own lines; they are all kinds of
"big-shots" who, by virtue of their
strength and speed, have been main
stays of various athletic teams. Just
ask them about it; they'll tell you.
"Well, I have to study." These are
the words that break up freshman bull
sessions, for the summer frosh are
exceedingly jealous of each other. If
one of a group studies, the rest must
do likewise.
