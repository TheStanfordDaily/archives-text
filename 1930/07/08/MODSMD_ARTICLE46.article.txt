# FINISHING TOUCHES BEING GIVEN SUNKEN BASEBALL DIAMOND
## 
### 
Finishing touches are being put on
Stanford's new sunken baseball field.
Workmen are leveling the top of the
embankment in back of the bleachers.
Turf will be started after this is fin
ished. The field will lie ready for var
sity competition the first time next
spring.
"When the field is finished it will be
one of the best on the Pacific coast,"
says Don Liebendorfer of the Board
of Athletic Control. "One feature of it
being that there will be turf in the
outfield as well as the infield. It is
one of the few if not the only sunken
diamond on this coast."
The new field is built on the plan of
the stadium with the bleachers tiered
on the embankment directly ueliiiul
the catcher's box.
A gang of men are at work getting
the stadium in readiness for "Pop"
Warner's football machine to run wild
in this fall. The turf is being groomed,
seats replaced, and the top fourteen
rows painted. It is necessary to re
place some of tiie seats every year as
a precaution against possible acci
dents.
