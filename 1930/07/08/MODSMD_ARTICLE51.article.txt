# HAWAII UNIVERSITY IS MELTING POT OF PACIFIC. SAYS BAILEY

! "The University of Hawaii, located
at the cross-roads of the Pacific, is
j where East meets West," says Dr.
I Thomas A. Bailey, assistant professor
! of history at the University. "The
| students are largely Chinese and Jap
anese with an increasing number of
; Caucasions, Hawaiians, and part-Ha
| waiians. There is also u sprinkling of
j Koreans, Philippine Islanders, and
1 Negroes. All seven races get along
harmoniously, the University is truly
a great melting pot.
"Unlike the mainland student, the
student who comes to the University
J of Hawaii usually comes at a sacrifice i
and is there to make something out of '
j himself," Dr. Bailey continued. "He is
quiet and attentive in class, trying to
i learn all lie can. He is interested in '
: debating, in international relations,
j and particularly in t he problems of
| the Pacific.
"Distracting influences like national
sororities and fraternities are tin- j
known at Hawaii. Although sports,
drama, debating, dancing, and other
college activjties are provided, they do
not loom so large in the life of the
student as on the mainland."
"The University of Hawaii is a tor- |
ritorial institution corresponding to
our state university. It is beautifully '
situated on a three-hundred-acre camp
us among continuously green hills and
lawns with a surrounding of tropical
foliage and trees. The climate is nev
er hot but always warm enough to |

, make boating and bathing in the Pa
j cific attractive.
"During regular session the univer
sity has an enrollment of over 1)00
full-time students and a faculty of
j sixty or seventy. It is probably the
| best equipped university in tho world
for the conduct of agricultural re
search in sugar and pineapple culture.
Each summer the university conducts
an excellent summer session. The
ablest men available are brought ovej*
from the mainland."
Dr. Bailey took his bachelor's de
gree from Stanford in 1924, and was
| granted his doctorate three years
' later. He was a member of the Uni
versity debating teams in 1923 and
UÂ»24. While on the campus this sum
mer, Dr. Bailey is engaged in writing
ia book to bo published in the near
; future.
