# MANTZ, LOCAL FLIER, SETS WORLD RECORD FOR OUTSIDE LOOPS
## 
### 
Forced down when his gasoline sup
ply gave out Paul Mantz cf the Palo
Alto School of Aviation set a new
world's record of forty-six consecutive
outside loops Sunday at the Curtiss-
Wright flying field at Beresford. He
was using his training plane, a stock
model Fleet, powered with a hundred
horsepower Kinner motor.
Mantz was up to break the record
held by Gordon Monunce; however j
Dale Jackson of Chicago had the same j
idea and took off about half an hour
before Mantz. Both fliers were in the ,
air at the same time.
Jackson landed after making thirty- j
six loops. Friends of Mantz's heard of j
this and immediately took off in a i

..ship willi tlu; numerals "3(>" printed
on tin* side. Maptz saw tliem as lie
was completing liis twenty-fifth loop,
tlie number he had intended to do in
order to break Monunce's record, .sig
naled that lu> understood and deter
mined to make fifty loops.
Outside looping is a terrific strain
on the plane and man, but the hip
problem is gasoline shortage, as going
over throws the gas out through the
air vent. Anticipating this Mantz in
stalled a small gas tank in his cockpit,
but this emergency supply gave out
after the forty-sixth loop.
The first outside loop record was set
by Tex Rankin when he did sixteen.
Later Gordon Nominee set a record
of twenty-two. The latter is hte one
Paul Mantz was out to break but was
forced to extend himself and his plane
when Jackson set a new record in
Chicago a few minutes before he had
finished his intended number oL"
twenty-five.
