# STANFORD GOLF STAR WINS FROM HOFFMAN
## 
### 
George Eberliart, Stanford varsity
golfer, beat Ralph Hoffman of Castle
wood Country Club, Menlo Invitation
al winner, by the score 2 and 1 Sun
day at the Orinda Invitational Tourna
ment across the bay.
Eberliart shot 7?., one over par,
and won without being in danger on
the latter holes. The result was a sur
prise, as Hoffman last week trimmed
two former 1 " champions of Northern
California, John J. McHugh and Law
son Little, who recently eliminated
Hobby Jones in the U.S. amateur, to
win the Menlo cup.
Next Saturday Eberliart must meet
Hugh Ditzler, who continues to shoot
the best golf in the field. On Sunday
lie carded a 71, one under par.
