# WATER MAIN TO BE CLEARED BY HUGE GO-DEVIL
## Torpedo-Like Object Scrapes 24,000 Feet Of Pipe In Less Than Three Hours Engineers Visit Campus To See Work Of Projectile On Stanford System 
### 
Starting from the intake at Sears
ville Lake at II o'clock this morning,
a heavy seven-foot Go-Devil will be
sent through the 24,000 feet of water
main to its outlet at the Stanford
campus. The trip will require approxi
mately 2 hours and 40 minutes, since
the machine travels at the rate of
about 3,000 l'oet each 20 minutes.
The huge go-devil, with its metal
nose and /ins all around, resembles
a torpedo. The fins scrape all foreign
matter from the pipe through which
the machine travels on its own power,
which is generated by the force of
the water working through pistons
inside the torpedo. As the machine
forges ahead, refuse which it dis
lodges is carried away by the water.
This novel method of cleaning an
underground water system is em
ployed by the National Water Main
Cleaning Company of New York City.
The company is represented on its
local project by L. S. Olding. J. W.
McDonnell, assistant superintendent
of buildings and grounds, is repre
senting the University in the under
taking.
Mr. McDonnell estimates that the
trip of the go-devil through the pipe
will cost but 15 cents a foot. This
represents only 5 per cent of the cost
of the pipe.
Although the process has been used
before, the Stanford project is on such
a large scale that it is creating great
interest. Representatives from the
water departments of San Francisco,
Sacramento, Monterey, and Santa
Ilosa have been on the campus to
ox." mine the course of the work.
Upon completing his contract here,
Mr. Olding is taking the equipment
to San Francisco, where lie will clean
an eighteen-inch salt water suction
for the Paraffine Paint Company."
