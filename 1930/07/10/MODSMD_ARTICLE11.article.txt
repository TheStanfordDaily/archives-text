"The bottom of the present eco
nomic depression lias been reached
is the opinion of many business execu
tives in the East," says Professor H.
J. Jackson of the Graduate School of
Business, who recently read a paper
before a conference of the Nat.uÂ» r "il
Association of Cost n
Syracuse, New York. lit? also visited
New York City, Washington, D.C., and
other eastern cities.
"However, nearly everyone was op
timistic." lie said. "The men attend
ing tlie conference are men who are
literally on the inside of the affairs of
large firms. They believe that between
now and September tiie country will
experience its worst times. Many look
for a new low point to be reached on
the stock market in August."
Discussing the matter further, Pro
fessor Jackson said "the disturbance
seems to be much more serious in the
ICasl than it is here. A comparison of
the earnings of many firms this year
with those of last year is going to re
veal some startling facts.
"This depression exists," he ex
plained. "in spite of the fact that
money is available. The call money
rate is low, People simply are not
buying things."
Before going to the conference, Pro
fessor Jackson delivered the com
mencement address at Simpson Col
lege in lowa, his alma mater, at
which time an LL.D. degree waa con
ferred upon him.
