# LET'S MAKE A STANDARD FORM

"Won't somebody call a meeting of representatives from each
department .... who will make up an accepted and standard set of
rules?" pleads a writer whose communication appears in todav's
Campus Opinion department. The writer wants to eliminate the waste
effort that results from lack of unity in thesis typography require
ments —a reasonable suggestion. But in a university there is danger
in rules aimed at compelling uniformity. One rule leads to others.
I his'particular suggestion may have a good deal to recommend it.
There does not appear to be any advantage in contradictory styles in
thesis details, and there would be some gain in convenience through
uniformity. It is a comparatively trivial matter, merely a superficial
smoothing over of annoying irregularities, it is doubtless going too
far to imagine that little by little there would be developed a whole
system of thesis form requirements, resulting finally in a fixed or
ganization for the material in all theses, but that is the way in which
hampering restrictions do get built up.
A degree of standardization is useful: too much standardization is
deadly to the spirit of a university; and little rules easily grow into
rigid systems.
