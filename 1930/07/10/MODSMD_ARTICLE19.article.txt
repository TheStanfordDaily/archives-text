# TOBACCO ON THE AIR
## 
### 
The filthy weed is in for it again. At the recent meeting of the
National Kducation Association in Columbus, Ohio, a resolution was
adopted disapproving the use of radio channels for tobacco advertis
ing. The educators believe that radio broadcasting is a public utility
that is in danger of being monopolized bv interests of unwholesome
influence.
The tobacco companies have always been indefatigable advertisers.
In periodicals and on billboards they have heralded their wares
through displays that are the consummation of visual appeal. Since
the advent of the broadcasting medium they have promptly gone on
the air with excellent programs interspersed with their famous slogans
and designed to remove the last tinge of suspicion regarding the use
of their products.
Cn<|uestionably they have been effective. Witness the tremendous
increase in the use of cigarettes alone. The number used in a year is
incredible.
Educators may well become concerned, for their classroom ex
hortations against the baleful effects of tobacco on youthful health
are mort than offset by much more entertaining arguments on the
affirmative side. In fact, the adolescent is almost led to believe that
he can refuse to smoke only at the expense of his health.
The point always rises, however, as to just what effect prohibiting
or limiting tobacco companies from broadcasting would have on reduc
ing the number of users, which is, presumably, one of the purposes
of the resolution. Billboards, newspapers, and magazines would con
tinue to carry the advertisements. And greater than any other medium
is the actual use of the weed by a person's friends and the people with
whom he comes in contact. The increase in the use of cigarettes by
women is acounted for more bv the actual sight of women smoking
than by testimonial advertising.
There is no good reason apparent why manufacturers of tobacco
products should not utilize the radio to advertise their products. On
the other hand, educators have ;i right to protest against it.
