# GERMANY FRIENDLY TOWARD U.S. TODAY STATES VON KLENZE

"Germany is aware that her no
lions of the United States before the
war were wrong. The people remem
bered after the great conflict that the
United Slates prevented a Gorman
victory in 1914 and held some ill feel
ing toward her, but they are getting
away from that iduu." This was the
statement of Dr. Camillo von Klenze,
acting professor of German, who
spoke in the Little Theatre Tuesday
night on "Intellectual and Social Cur
rents in Present-Day Germany."
"The American occupation along
the Ithine," he continued, "has done
much to heal the; war trouble. The
American soldiers were much more
considerate and very much more de
cent to the German people than the;
soldiers of the other nations. At least,
that is the feeling."
Asks For Understanding
In a very clear-cut manner, Dr. von
Klenze asked for a correct under
standing of tlie German people of
today on the part of the American
people, and a corresponding knowl
edge in Germany of Americans. He
said that until recently Americans
1 were thought t»f as knowing how to '
' make "nothing but money, in the
'land of the dollar,' a people nothing
but practical."
Continuing, he declared "thou
sands of students and men, who he
fore the war were subsidized by
wealthy families and lived the gay
life of young bloods in the universi
j ties, now find themselves compelled
j to work long hours, and to work hard
! to go to the universities at all.
Referring to Leland Stanford, one ,
ol the four original heads of the
j Pacific Railroad, Dr. von Klenze said:
, "The creation in America of men of
j great wealth on the one hand and
great wisdom on the other, who de
vote time to public enterprise, such
as the man who founded the univer
sity where we sit tonight, is showing
jan increasing number of people in
1 Germany that the United State.-; is
something more than a country that
j knows how to make money.
| "Germany is in a very interesting
! turmoil, not only on the economic ,-ido
! but on the spiritual, and closely con
nected with the idea that a new world
| has come for better or worse, is Ihe i
attitude toward the United States.
Goethe's famous words were: 'What
does one human being know about
another human being?' and how much
j less do countries!
"After the World War came im- ,
jinen.se poverty and destruction of for- i
• tunes by the hundreds, partly in con
} sequence of the revolution. And now
! the thought for today is: Where are
• we? What is the value of all the
things we prized before the war?
! What is wealth? What does it amount
j to in modern civilization? But greater
| still, what is science? Are we intelli
jgent enough to prevent such a holo
caust as in 1914, or are we so preju
diced and so blind as to permit a
j recurrence of that terrible war?
"There is an intense desire for
j peace in Germany. Is it possible to
i organize our life so as not to abandon
I the modern inventions, loveable and
j useful, but to raise ourselves above
i the level on which we have all stood?
; This sounds like all the people in
j Germany are worrying about this. No,
j millions are worrying about feeding
their children and how to get little,
I pleasures out of life."

American soldiers were much more
considerate and very much more de
cent to the German people than the;
soldiers of the other nations. At least,
that is the feeling."
Asks For Understanding
In a very clear-cut manner, Dr. von
Klenze asked for a correct under
standing of tlie German people of
today on the part of the American
people, and a corresponding knowl
edge in Germany of Americans. He
said that until recently Americans
1 were thought t»f as knowing how to '
' make "nothing but money, in the
'land of the dollar,' a people nothing
but practical."
Continuing, he declared "thou
sands of students and men, who he
fore the war were subsidized by
wealthy families and lived the gay
life of young bloods in the universi
j ties, now find themselves compelled
j to work long hours, and to work hard
! to go to the universities at all.
Referring to Leland Stanford, one ,
ol the four original heads of the
j Pacific Railroad, Dr. von Klenze said:
, "The creation in America of men of
j great wealth on the one hand and
great wisdom on the other, who de
vote time to public enterprise, such
as the man who founded the univer
sity where we sit tonight, is showing
jan increasing number of people in
1 Germany that the United State.-; is
something more than a country that
j knows how to make money.
| "Germany is in a very interesting
! turmoil, not only on the economic ,-ido
! but on the spiritual, and closely con
nected with the idea that a new world
| has come for better or worse, is Ihe i
attitude toward the United States.
Goethe's famous words were: 'What
does one human being know about
another human being?' and how much
j less do countries!
"After the World War came im- ,
jinen.se poverty and destruction of for- i
• tunes by the hundreds, partly in con
} sequence of the revolution. And now
! the thought for today is: Where are
• we? What is the value of all the
things we prized before the war?
! What is wealth? What does it amount
j to in modern civilization? But greater
| still, what is science? Are we intelli
jgent enough to prevent such a holo
caust as in 1914, or are we so preju
diced and so blind as to permit a
j recurrence of that terrible war?
"There is an intense desire for
j peace in Germany. Is it possible to
i organize our life so as not to abandon
I the modern inventions, loveable and
j useful, but to raise ourselves above
i the level on which we have all stood?
; This sounds like all the people in
j Germany are worrying about this. No,
j millions are worrying about feeding
their children and how to get little,
I pleasures out of life."
"Germany is aware that her no
lions of the United States before the
war were wrong. The people remem
bered after the great conflict that the
United Slates prevented a Gorman
victory in 1914 and held some ill feel
ing toward her, but they are getting
away from that iduu." This was the
statement of Dr. Camillo von Klenze,
acting professor of German, who
spoke in the Little Theatre Tuesday
night on "Intellectual and Social Cur
rents in Present-Day Germany."
"The American occupation along
the Ithine," he continued, "has done
much to heal the; war trouble. The
American soldiers were much more
considerate and very much more de
cent to the German people than the;
soldiers of the other nations. At least,
that is the feeling."
