To The Editor, Sir:
It has been my lot to type n con
' siderable number of theses for Stan
lord students during the five years
of my residence here. These repre
sent practically every department
in the University and —here's the
point I'm making —practically every
department and every individual pro
fessor has a different idea of the
right form for a thesis, resulting in
I much confusion, loss of time and work
! for the student working on his thesis,
; not forgetting the stenographer Who
I has to type the darn thing.
Of course there are a few thesis
: writers who have the forethought to
; find out at the very beginning just
what the requirements of their par-
I ticular departments are arid just how
' their professors want things clone.
Also it is possible to obtain mimeo
! graphed copies of rules and regula
tions on the subject of thesis writing
j- —that is, for each special department.
But why not' have a Stanford form?
I To show you what a mix-up it is at
present, let me give a few examples.
I For instance, one department 1 have
lin mind insists on having footnotes
'numbered consecutively through the
i MS, while another specifies that the
j

[footnotes must be numbered starting
with 1 on each page. Still another re
quires that the names of authors in
j footnotes or references shall appear
with the lust name first and then the
initials, while other departments de
mand the reverse. Again some pro
fessors consider it a crime and mis- i
demeanor to number the pages in the
top right-hand corner, while others
would be highly provoked should typ
ist or student make the mistake of
numbering the pages in center top,
and so on ad infinitum.
Let's get together, folks! Won't
; somebody call a meeting of repre
sentatives from each department who I
will once, and for all decide on just;
what the well-dressed thesis will wear
henceforth and who will make up an
accepted and standard set of rules,
thus eliminating the present confu
sion and argument which always en
sues?
Of course this is only a suggestion
from a mere but long-suffering steno
grapher (and a stenographer isn't
supposed to have an idea above a Ilea)
but at the same time I know a good
many people who would appreciate
having the matter cleared up.

right form for a thesis, resulting in
I much confusion, loss of time and work
! for the student working on his thesis,
; not forgetting the stenographer Who
I has to type the darn thing.
Of course there are a few thesis
: writers who have the forethought to
; find out at the very beginning just
what the requirements of their par-
I ticular departments are arid just how
' their professors want things clone.
Also it is possible to obtain mimeo
! graphed copies of rules and regula
tions on the subject of thesis writing
j- —that is, for each special department.
But why not' have a Stanford form?
I To show you what a mix-up it is at
present, let me give a few examples.
I For instance, one department 1 have
lin mind insists on having footnotes
'numbered consecutively through the
i MS, while another specifies that the
j

[footnotes must be numbered starting
with 1 on each page. Still another re
quires that the names of authors in
j footnotes or references shall appear
with the lust name first and then the
initials, while other departments de
mand the reverse. Again some pro
fessors consider it a crime and mis- i
demeanor to number the pages in the
top right-hand corner, while others
would be highly provoked should typ
ist or student make the mistake of
numbering the pages in center top,
and so on ad infinitum.
Let's get together, folks! Won't
; somebody call a meeting of repre
sentatives from each department who I
will once, and for all decide on just;
what the well-dressed thesis will wear
henceforth and who will make up an
accepted and standard set of rules,
thus eliminating the present confu
sion and argument which always en
sues?
Of course this is only a suggestion
from a mere but long-suffering steno
grapher (and a stenographer isn't
supposed to have an idea above a Ilea)
but at the same time I know a good
many people who would appreciate
having the matter cleared up.
