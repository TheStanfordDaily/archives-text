Each ol the old Spanish settlers of
Monterey laid out his walled-in lot
in any shape or fashion he pleased,
and the charm of the irregular, wind
ing streets is still preserved after 150
years. After the American invasion,
the capital was moved from Monterey
to Sacramento, but Monterey is the
Mime serene and contented town, al-
I hough it larger by the ad

"There will always be a need for one
such place in California," writes
Frank .1. Taylor, former editor of
Stanford Illustrated Review.
The architectural style of the Car
mel Mission, which combines Spanish,
Moorish, and Roman influences, was
the one used as a model by Senator
Stanford in designing the quadrangles
on the campus. Open courts, long
colonnades, round arches, corridors,
tile roofs, are features of this unique
and picturesque, as well as commodi
ous and convenient, style.
.'lust north of Monterey is Del Monte,
covering 18,000 acres along the ocean
front, and since .1880 famous the
world -over as a sport center. The
Pebble Beach golf course is one of the
most beautiful and difficult in the
country. The coast, bordered by
gnarled cypress and wind-bent pine,
is considered by many critics to be
the most impressive stretch of rug
ged, rocky shoreline in California, and
is preserved as a park. The park is
open to the public and will be visited

The University maintains at Mon
terey Bay an important marine labora
tory, which has been referred to in

at Monterey, a low-lying structure
built in 1814 and still standing.
". . . . Benches, two or three feet
high, running around the side of the
house, built of adobe and white
washed, were shaded by the overhang
ing roof and made pleasant lounging
places on a hot day."
