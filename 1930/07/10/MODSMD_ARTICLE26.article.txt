# PALO ALTO AVIATOR STUNTS FOR MOVIES
## 
### 
Wednesday afternoon at the field
of the Palo Alto School of Aviation
Paul Mant.z, holder of the world's rec
ord for outside loops, made a com
plete loop for the Paramount News
Reel. He had difficulty with his car
buretor and trouble with his goggles
because the force of the wind while
he was in the loop blew them back,
obstructing his vision. The windshield
had been removed to place a camera
on the cowl of the cockpit in order
to get. a picture of his facial expres
sion during the loop. He came down
after three unsuccessful attempts, to
have the carburetor adjusted, then
went aloft and made a complete loop.
When questioned concerning the
: ensations in making the loop he said,
"The strain on the safety belt feels
as though a hundred men were pulling
a i your stomach. My senses were
numbed by the blood rushing to my
head as it does in high altitude fly
ing."
About the stunt he said, "Outside
looping is the hardest maneuver to
make with a plane. It is not possible
to do it with all planes because the
wings fold up, and, too, the pilot, is
apt to become muddled and lose all
rense of direction."
