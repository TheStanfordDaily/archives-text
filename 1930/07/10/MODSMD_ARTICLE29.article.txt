# Stanford Library Files Millions of Cards With Enlarging of Index
## 
### 
Would you like to read what was
I written in tlie Stanford Daily last fall
about the Big Game? Or perhaps it
I may be that some summer quarter
student would like to look over the
1 Axe Special. These may be found
easily because every one knows about
when the Bin Game was played or the
axe recaptured.
Nevertheless, the student may, with
little more difficulty, read what The
Daily had to say on any subject by
referring to the index made by the
University library of that publication.
This has been done according to sub
ject. The index may be found on
typewritten sheets bound with each
volume.
"This is one of the less important
i of innumerable services which the
library affords research workers and
others," says Nathan Van Patten,
University librarian. "However, the
I various catalogues we maintain are by
no means unimportant to the research
worker or the advanced student."
225 Libraries Cooperating
Perhaps first among the various
sources of information comes the
Union List of Serials. This is a book
edited by Winifred Gregory, with an
, advisory committee appointed by the
American Library Association. The
personnel of the advisory committee
includes H. M. Lydenberg, assistant
director of the New York Public Lib
rary; C. W. Andrews, librarian of the
John Crerar Library, Chicago; Willard
Austen, librarian at Cornell Univer
sity; A. E. Bostwick, in charge of the
St Louis Public Library; T. J. Ger
ould, librarian at Princeton Univer
sity; and Nathan Van Patten, director
of libraries at Stanford. It contains
75,000 titles and is keyed to show the
holdings of 225 of the most important
libraries in the United States and
Canada.
The value of this Union list of Se
rials to a research student at Stanford
lies in tlie fact, that these 225 co-oper
ating libraries loan material to each
| other, and this enables tlie Stanford
, library to secure such material, if it is
I to be had, of any of the other institu
' tions. Titles owned by Stanford Uni
versity libraries are indicated by the
abbreviation "CSt" for the University
(library; "CSt-L" for the Lane Medi
cal library; and "CSt-H" for the
Hoover War library. Original publica
tion was made in 1927. In order to
care of additions and changes, a sup
plement is being issued, of which sec
11ion 1, "Titles A. to C" was published
I in April of this year. A similar Union
! list covering document s is being com
piled under the direction of the same
| editors.
Millions of Cards Filed
An aid of perhaps even wider scope in
| some respects is the Union Catalogue.
This is made up largely of cards is
sued by the Library ol' Congress and
includes entries from certain other
libraries; i.e., cards published by the
University of Chicago, University of
Michigan, Harvard University, and
the Royal Library of Berlin. There
'are quite a number of recent entries
i from the British Museum.
The number of these cards runs in
-1 to tlie millions. They enable the re
search worker to ascertain if a. cer
| tain book exists, and if so where it |
may be found. In addition to these
I card lists, the Stanford library has
the general catalogue of the National
| Library at Paris, of the British Mu
; seum, and of the Library of Congress,
in slip form.
Other sources of information in
j elude the Readers Guide to Periodical
Literature, catalogued according to
; author and subject; the Agricultural

Index and Industrial Arts Index; the
Engineering Index; the Education In
dex; Annual Magazine Subject Index;
Dramatic Index, which includes Amer
ican and English periodicals; and the
j New York Times Index, which is is
j sued quarterly, and which The Times
[calls "a master key to all newspapers."
A Summary of Criticisms
There is an Art Index, which is a
j catalogue by subject and author to peri
odicals and books devoted to the fine
| arts, and to museum bulletins (-over
ling all phases of the arts. Volume 1,
j N T o. 5 was issued in May.
A Publir Affairs Information Serv
i ive publishes a current bibliography
'of selected material in English rela
i ting to economic, social, and political
'affairs. The Book Review Digest gives
Jan author and title list of books, and
also gives a summary of what differ
j ent periodicals have reported concern
ing any book, so that from this one
source one can evaluate the criti-
J cisms of any book. The Bibliographic
| al Index is another reference list cov
j ering pamphlets and books by subject.
I With all of these reference lists,
I Mr. Van Patten believes that the lib
j rary staff is in position to discover al-
I most any information desired by a re
j search worker concerning sources of
' material. The library is open from S
j to 10 o'clock daily, from 8 to 5 o'clock
! on Saturday, and from 2 to 6 o'clock
i on Sunday.

, advisory committee appointed by the
American Library Association. The
personnel of the advisory committee
includes H. M. Lydenberg, assistant
director of the New York Public Lib
rary; C. W. Andrews, librarian of the
John Crerar Library, Chicago; Willard
Austen, librarian at Cornell Univer
sity; A. E. Bostwick, in charge of the
St Louis Public Library; T. J. Ger
ould, librarian at Princeton Univer
sity; and Nathan Van Patten, director
of libraries at Stanford. It contains
75,000 titles and is keyed to show the
holdings of 225 of the most important
libraries in the United States and
Canada.
The value of this Union list of Se
rials to a research student at Stanford
lies in tlie fact, that these 225 co-oper
ating libraries loan material to each
| other, and this enables tlie Stanford
, library to secure such material, if it is
I to be had, of any of the other institu
' tions. Titles owned by Stanford Uni
versity libraries are indicated by the
abbreviation "CSt" for the University
(library; "CSt-L" for the Lane Medi
cal library; and "CSt-H" for the
Hoover War library. Original publica
tion was made in 1927. In order to
care of additions and changes, a sup
plement is being issued, of which sec
11ion 1, "Titles A. to C" was published
I in April of this year. A similar Union
! list covering document s is being com
piled under the direction of the same
| editors.
Millions of Cards Filed
An aid of perhaps even wider scope in
| some respects is the Union Catalogue.
This is made up largely of cards is
sued by the Library ol' Congress and
includes entries from certain other
libraries; i.e., cards published by the
University of Chicago, University of
Michigan, Harvard University, and
the Royal Library of Berlin. There
'are quite a number of recent entries
i from the British Museum.
The number of these cards runs in
-1 to tlie millions. They enable the re
search worker to ascertain if a. cer
| tain book exists, and if so where it |
may be found. In addition to these
I card lists, the Stanford library has
the general catalogue of the National
| Library at Paris, of the British Mu
; seum, and of the Library of Congress,
in slip form.
Other sources of information in
j elude the Readers Guide to Periodical
Literature, catalogued according to
; author and subject; the Agricultural

Index and Industrial Arts Index; the
Engineering Index; the Education In
dex; Annual Magazine Subject Index;
Dramatic Index, which includes Amer
ican and English periodicals; and the
j New York Times Index, which is is

[calls "a master key to all newspapers."
A Summary of Criticisms
There is an Art Index, which is a
j catalogue by subject and author to peri
odicals and books devoted to the fine
| arts, and to museum bulletins (-over
ling all phases of the arts. Volume 1,
j N T o. 5 was issued in May.
A Publir Affairs Information Serv
i ive publishes a current bibliography
'of selected material in English rela
i ting to economic, social, and political
'affairs. The Book Review Digest gives
Jan author and title list of books, and
also gives a summary of what differ
j ent periodicals have reported concern
ing any book, so that from this one
source one can evaluate the criti-
J cisms of any book. The Bibliographic
| al Index is another reference list cov
j ering pamphlets and books by subject.
I With all of these reference lists,
I Mr. Van Patten believes that the lib
j rary staff is in position to discover al-
I most any information desired by a re
j search worker concerning sources of
' material. The library is open from S
j to 10 o'clock daily, from 8 to 5 o'clock
! on Saturday, and from 2 to 6 o'clock
i on Sunday.
Would you like to read what was
I written in tlie Stanford Daily last fall
about the Big Game? Or perhaps it
I may be that some summer quarter
student would like to look over the
1 Axe Special. These may be found
easily because every one knows about
when the Bin Game was played or the
axe recaptured.
Nevertheless, the student may, with
little more difficulty, read what The
Daily had to say on any subject by
referring to the index made by the
University library of that publication.
This has been done according to sub
ject. The index may be found on
typewritten sheets bound with each
volume.
"This is one of the less important
i of innumerable services which the
library affords research workers and
others," says Nathan Van Patten,
University librarian. "However, the
I various catalogues we maintain are by
no means unimportant to the research
worker or the advanced student."

Millions of Cards Filed
An aid of perhaps even wider scope in

This is made up largely of cards is
sued by the Library ol' Congress and
includes entries from certain other
libraries; i.e., cards published by the
University of Chicago, University of
Michigan, Harvard University, and
the Royal Library of Berlin. There
'are quite a number of recent entries
i from the British Museum.
The number of these cards runs in
-1 to tlie millions. They enable the re
search worker to ascertain if a. cer

may be found. In addition to these
I card lists, the Stanford library has
the general catalogue of the National
| Library at Paris, of the British Mu
; seum, and of the Library of Congress,
in slip form.
Other sources of information in
j elude the Readers Guide to Periodical
Literature, catalogued according to
; author and subject; the Agricultural

Index and Industrial Arts Index; the
Engineering Index; the Education In

Dramatic Index, which includes Amer

[calls "a master key to all newspapers."
A Summary of Criticisms
There is an Art Index, which is a
j catalogue by subject and author to peri
odicals and books devoted to the fine
| arts, and to museum bulletins (-over
ling all phases of the arts. Volume 1,
j N T o. 5 was issued in May.
A Publir Affairs Information Serv
i ive publishes a current bibliography
'of selected material in English rela
i ting to economic, social, and political
'affairs. The Book Review Digest gives
Jan author and title list of books, and
also gives a summary of what differ
j ent periodicals have reported concern
ing any book, so that from this one
source one can evaluate the criti-
J cisms of any book. The Bibliographic
| al Index is another reference list cov
j ering pamphlets and books by subject.
I With all of these reference lists,
I Mr. Van Patten believes that the lib
j rary staff is in position to discover al-
I most any information desired by a re
j search worker concerning sources of
' material. The library is open from S
j to 10 o'clock daily, from 8 to 5 o'clock
! on Saturday, and from 2 to 6 o'clock
i on Sunday.
Would you like to read what was
I written in tlie Stanford Daily last fall
about the Big Game? Or perhaps it
I may be that some summer quarter
student would like to look over the
1 Axe Special. These may be found
easily because every one knows about
when the Bin Game was played or the
axe recaptured.
Nevertheless, the student may, with
little more difficulty, read what The
Daily had to say on any subject by
referring to the index made by the
University library of that publication.
This has been done according to sub
ject. The index may be found on
typewritten sheets bound with each
volume.
"This is one of the less important
i of innumerable services which the
library affords research workers and
others," says Nathan Van Patten,
University librarian. "However, the
I various catalogues we maintain are by
no means unimportant to the research
worker or the advanced student."
225 Libraries Cooperating
Perhaps first among the various
sources of information comes the
Union List of Serials. This is a book
edited by Winifred Gregory, with an
, advisory committee appointed by the
American Library Association. The
personnel of the advisory committee
includes H. M. Lydenberg, assistant
director of the New York Public Lib
rary; C. W. Andrews, librarian of the
John Crerar Library, Chicago; Willard
Austen, librarian at Cornell Univer
sity; A. E. Bostwick, in charge of the
St Louis Public Library; T. J. Ger
ould, librarian at Princeton Univer
sity; and Nathan Van Patten, director
of libraries at Stanford. It contains
75,000 titles and is keyed to show the
holdings of 225 of the most important
libraries in the United States and
Canada.
The value of this Union list of Se
rials to a research student at Stanford
lies in tlie fact, that these 225 co-oper
ating libraries loan material to each
| other, and this enables tlie Stanford
, library to secure such material, if it is
I to be had, of any of the other institu
' tions. Titles owned by Stanford Uni
versity libraries are indicated by the
abbreviation "CSt" for the University
(library; "CSt-L" for the Lane Medi
cal library; and "CSt-H" for the
Hoover War library. Original publica
