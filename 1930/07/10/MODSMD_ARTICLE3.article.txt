# Princeton Geology Students Visit On Campus
## Cosmopolitan Group Touring United States Observes Rock Strata 
### 
Seventeen Princeton students ac
i companled by two of their professors
| and four professors from abroad, wi
lder the direction of Prof. J. C. Fields,
! visited the campus yesterday. These
men, organized as the International
I Summer School of Geology and Na
i tural Resources, were entertained by
j tlie University at a buffet luncheon
j in the Women's Clubhouse. Following
j the informal luncheon the visitors
land tiie local men interested in geol
ogy walked about the campus and
visited the Geology building.
The purpose of this school is based
on the principle that practical obser
vation in the field is more valuable
| than classroom discussion to the geol
ogy student. By personally visiting
tiie different geological formations,
the mines, and oil wells, it is felt that
the student has a better chance Lo
learn about these things.
The visiting professors from abroad,
Prof. Frank Debenham of Cambridge,
j England, Doctors H. Schneiderhohn
land P. Remdoht of Germany, and Dr.
j Otakar Matouesek of Czechoslovakia
j were invited to help bring about a
better feeling of international rela
tionship among geologists which has
been neglected to a great extent dur-
I ing the previous years.
| The work done on this tour of 11,000
| miles over the United States, taking
j thirty-five days to complete, counts
for regular university credit. Notes
and pictures are taken during the
summer and at the end of the course
a three-hour examination is given.
One year they tour the United States
j and the next year they tour Canada.
L. S. Rockefeller, grandson of John
D., is one of the students, and was
selected as photographer for the
party. He spent most of his time tak
ing views of the (campus and ex-
I pressed his regret at not "having a
longer stay so he could see more of
the University. At Princeton, where
I ho is a junior, he is a staff photogra
pher of the college paper.
The group returned to San Fran
] cisco at o::J0, where they will leave
jon their private Pullman car for
j Seattle, Washington. From there they
| will return east by way of Yelolw
j stone Park.
