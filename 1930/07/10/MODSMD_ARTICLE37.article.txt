# TENURE LAW NEEDS CHANGE-DR. ALMACK
## 
### 
j The need for a change in the pres
! enl tenure law for teachers was ex
j pressed by Dr. J. C. Almack at the
j Wednesday noon meeting of the men
j of the Education department. Though
I he believes in t lie principle of teacher
! tenure, Dr. Almack believes that pub
| lie opposition and the lack of co-opera
j tion of certain boards of education
| makes it impossible to continue the
| present law.
| Several suggestions for changes
have been made. One is to substitute
ja yearly basis of tenure for I he pres
l ent law. Another is the return to the
■ law of 1921 which did not apply to
■ rural schools. "This," according to
I Dr. Almack, "ignores the real point,
i whether the tenure principle is right
jor wrong. 1 do not favor this avoid
ance of the issue."
Another suggestion is that a new
law should provide for a probationary
! period and tenure, with appeal, in
lease of dismissal, to a professional
| body, "i believe that this is a splendid
suggestion, hut I doubt if the teach
ing profession will advocate it," lie
I said.
