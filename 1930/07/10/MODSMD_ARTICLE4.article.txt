# CONFUCIUS IS MAIN FACTOR IN CHINESE LIFE SAYS MALONE
## 
### 
"China's ability to preserve her
high state of civilization," said Pro
fessor Carroll B. Malone, in a lecture
on the great Chinese philosopher yes
terday afternoon, "is due in large
measure to the respect and obedience
accorded by the Chinese to the moral
and religious precepts laid down by
Confucius.
"For many individuals Confucius
was only a great sage," says Professor
Malone. "For some he was a god. it
is clear, however, that Confucius
never considered himself a god, that
any spirituality with which he is ac
credited comes from his followers
rather than himself.
"Confucius was born in the sixth
century 8.C., a period of great reli
gious activity. He did not agree with
theory that all should be educated.
He believed that only those who were
eager to learn, and willing to sacri
fice for learning, were worthy of
being taught. During his lifetime
Confucius instructed more than three
i thousand students in the art of living
and thinking.
"The primary interest of Confucius
! was politics. On several occasions he
held offices in which he acquitted
j himself with unusual credit. Despite
I his rather reactionary tendencies, this
: philosopher brought about many re
! forms while in office.
"If one could govern himself well
I in 'The Five Human Relations,' those
I between emperor and c ommoner,

: friend anil friend, he was considered
j by Confucius as a perfect gentleman.
! "The worship of Confucius is being
i keenly criticized by many of the
| younger Chinese who feel that the
I old religion is a relic; of past days.
[ Many temples dedicated to Confucius
I have been turned into libraries and

i pie of China still hold Confucius as
a model of imitation. They consider
him as a man, but as the wisest and
