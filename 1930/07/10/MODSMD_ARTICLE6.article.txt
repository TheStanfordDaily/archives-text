# MEROLA DIRECTS SYMPHONY OP.ERA CONCERT SUNDAY
## Sunday's Program Differs Radically From Usual Symphony Concert 
### 
Gaetano Merola will conduct the
next concert of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra at .the Wood
land Theatre Sunday. Merola is well
known as the director of the San
Francisco and Los Angeles Grand

I Opera Associations. In the summer of
1022 he also directed a series of
operas in the Stanford Stadium.
Sunday's concert will differ from
the past programs in that it will be
composed almost entirely of operatic
selections. It will include the bril
liant. Overture to "Mignon" which is
one of the most popular numbers in
this opera. A suite for orchestra by
Rameau, who has been called the
French Handel, will also be played.
Interesting Program Planned
Two of the most interesting selec
tions on the program will be the In
| teVmezzo from "Jewels of the Ma
donna" by Wolf-Ferrari and the In
troduction and March from "Coq d'Or"
i by Rimsky-Korsakoff. The "Jewels of
the Madonna" is a picture of Neapoli
tan underworld life. It contains every
| type of music from the mother's lul
]la by to the Apache dance.
The "Coq d'Or is a tragi-comedy
into which a political meaning of the
unhappy consequences following on
| mortal passions and weaknesses has
j been read. It. also satirizes well-known
j occurrences in the Japanese-Russian
, war.
American Number Played
Another number on the program
| will be The March of the Viceroy
I from "Fay Yen Fab" or the Laud of
Happiness. This American opera,
j which was written at Monte Carlo
j by Joseph Redding in 1925, contrasts
| Chinese exotic and Western harmony
'in a tale showing the influence of
I Occidental education on the Oriental
j mind.
I Other numbers on the program will
include the "Procession Nocturne" by
Ribaud, the Suite from "Carmen" by
! Bizet, and the Overture to "Tannhau-
J ser" by Wagner.
I The concert Sunday will be Merola's
| only appearance with the San Fran
[ cisco Symphony Orchestra this sea
ison. The next two concerts on July
I 20 and 27 will be under the direction
of Arthur Rodzinski.
