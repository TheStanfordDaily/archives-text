# DAILY'S RESEARCH UPSETS NEW YORKER'S FIRE THEORY
## 
### 
Il is a western tradition that grass |
and forest fires start from carelessly
dropped cigarette butts. Men who
have spent their time in the open i
western country explain that this is
no mere tradition but is based on j
countless fires. Chief Dugan of the I
Stanford Fire Department says. "Api
proximately eighty-five per cent of
the grass fives during the summer are
started by cigarettes, negligently ;
thrown away while still lighted." ,
But a smart young New Yorker,
hearing of this tradition, tipped back
in his swivel chair and offered to bet
that forest fires don't start that way. '
Just to prove his theory to a West- |
erner so "dumb" as to take up (lit! |
bet, our New Yorker friend flips his
lighted cigarette into the waste-paper
basket. With the rising of smoke from
the basket the Westerner begins to
feel prosperous, but no flame appears
and investigation shows that there is |
Hiily a little charred paper where the
I eigu retle lay. The experiment was re |

peated in the draft, with the same
results.
Daily Sponsers Research
The Daily, although inclined to
string along with Chief Dugan, Celt,
that this important matter should he
scientifically investigated. A member
of the staff with an appropriation for
cigarettes was delegated to carry on
research in this field.
On a hot day, with a nice wind
blowing, the searching reporter car
rying his equipment of one pack of
cigarettes and matches, proceeded to
drop a lighted cigarette, it hit the
grass, bounced, and settled in some
very dry material. The wind fanned
the glowing end, and soon the sur
rounding grass began to char. A spark
became visible and an extra gust of
wind fanned it until a small flame ap
peared, which was promptly stepped
on.
Fire Chief Supervises Research
To provide <mil rolled conditions of
the most approved kind on the follow- I
I ing day the experiment was repeated
before Chief Dugan, his firemen, a
red fire truck, and loaded extinguish
ers. Lighted cigarettes were care-j
| lessly dropped and carefully placed 1
in the driest grass and windiest places j
available. The grass charred, occa- j
sionally there was a spark in the |
grass, but no amount of persuasion i
would cause a flame to burst forth.
What is the answer? Did the ciga- !
rettes fear the watchful eye of Chief j
Dugan and the efficiency of tlie Stan- I
i ford Fire Department, and fade out j
J with no effort at destruction?
The fact remains that a fire can
be started from a glowing cigarette
| stub, regardless of the office research !
of any New Yorker. Grass and waste- j
paper, an office and the open country
: are not comparable situations. What !
will not happen in one place might I
i quite likely happen in the other place. |

The humidity was lower, the day j
was hotter, and the wind was strong
er on the day that the fire started
| than on the day the experiment was
.conducted by the lire department. Un- j
doubtedly these factors have a direct 1
bearing upon the probability of a fire j
starting.
The results of this experiment does j
indicate that the state is justified in j
passing a law making it illegal to
j throw cigarettes from a motor vehi- ;
cle. At a meeting of the state and '
local lire wardens in Sacramento last j
week a request was issued that peo
ple send in to the State the license
number of any motorist seen throw

j throw cigarettes from a motor vehi- ;
cle. At a meeting of the state and '
local lire wardens in Sacramento last j
week a request was issued that peo
ple send in to the State the license
number of any motorist seen throw
ing a lighted cigarette from the car.
Il is a western tradition that grass |
and forest fires start from carelessly
dropped cigarette butts. Men who
have spent their time in the open i
western country explain that this is
no mere tradition but is based on j
countless fires. Chief Dugan of the I
Stanford Fire Department says. "Api
proximately eighty-five per cent of
the grass fives during the summer are
started by cigarettes, negligently ;
thrown away while still lighted." ,
But a smart young New Yorker,
hearing of this tradition, tipped back
in his swivel chair and offered to bet
that forest fires don't start that way. '
Just to prove his theory to a West- |
erner so "dumb" as to take up (lit! |
bet, our New Yorker friend flips his
lighted cigarette into the waste-paper
basket. With the rising of smoke from
the basket the Westerner begins to
feel prosperous, but no flame appears
and investigation shows that there is |
Hiily a little charred paper where the
I eigu retle lay. The experiment was re |

peated in the draft, with the same
results.
Daily Sponsers Research
The Daily, although inclined to
string along with Chief Dugan, Celt,
that this important matter should he
scientifically investigated. A member
of the staff with an appropriation for
cigarettes was delegated to carry on
research in this field.
On a hot day, with a nice wind
blowing, the searching reporter car
rying his equipment of one pack of
cigarettes and matches, proceeded to
drop a lighted cigarette, it hit the
grass, bounced, and settled in some
very dry material. The wind fanned
the glowing end, and soon the sur
rounding grass began to char. A spark
became visible and an extra gust of
wind fanned it until a small flame ap
peared, which was promptly stepped
on.
Fire Chief Supervises Research
To provide <mil rolled conditions of
the most approved kind on the follow- I
I ing day the experiment was repeated
before Chief Dugan, his firemen, a
red fire truck, and loaded extinguish
ers. Lighted cigarettes were care-j
| lessly dropped and carefully placed 1
in the driest grass and windiest places j
available. The grass charred, occa- j
sionally there was a spark in the |
grass, but no amount of persuasion i
would cause a flame to burst forth.
What is the answer? Did the ciga- !
rettes fear the watchful eye of Chief j
Dugan and the efficiency of tlie Stan- I
i ford Fire Department, and fade out j
J with no effort at destruction?
The fact remains that a fire can
be started from a glowing cigarette

of any New Yorker. Grass and waste- j
paper, an office and the open country

will not happen in one place might I
i quite likely happen in the other place. |

doubtedly these factors have a direct 1
bearing upon the probability of a fire j
starting.
The results of this experiment does j
indicate that the state is justified in j
