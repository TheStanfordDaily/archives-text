# DAILY'S RESEARCH UPSETS NEW YORKER'S FIRE THEORY
## 
### 
Il is a western tradition that grass |
and forest fires start from carelessly
dropped cigarette butts. Men who
have spent their time in the open i
western country explain that this is
no mere tradition but is based on j
countless fires. Chief Dugan of the I
Stanford Fire Department says. "Api
proximately eighty-five per cent of
the grass fives during the summer are
started by cigarettes, negligently ;
thrown away while still lighted." ,
But a smart young New Yorker,
hearing of this tradition, tipped back
in his swivel chair and offered to bet
that forest fires don't start that way. '
Just to prove his theory to a West- |
erner so "dumb" as to take up (lit! |
bet, our New Yorker friend flips his
lighted cigarette into the waste-paper
basket. With the rising of smoke from
the basket the Westerner begins to
feel prosperous, but no flame appears
and investigation shows that there is |
Hiily a little charred paper where the
I eigu retle lay. The experiment was re |

peated in the draft, with the same
results.

The Daily, although inclined to
string along with Chief Dugan, Celt,
that this important matter should he
scientifically investigated. A member
of the staff with an appropriation for
cigarettes was delegated to carry on
research in this field.
On a hot day, with a nice wind
blowing, the searching reporter car
rying his equipment of one pack of
cigarettes and matches, proceeded to
drop a lighted cigarette, it hit the
grass, bounced, and settled in some
very dry material. The wind fanned
the glowing end, and soon the sur
rounding grass began to char. A spark
became visible and an extra gust of
wind fanned it until a small flame ap
peared, which was promptly stepped
on.
