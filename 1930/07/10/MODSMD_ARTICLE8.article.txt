# PYGMALION TO MAKE DEBUT FOR CAMPUS AUDIENCE AT PERFORMANCE TOMORROW
## Director Helvenston Puts Finishing Touches on Production; Crary and Wenig Give Clever Character Portrayal; Keho and Rosenblatt Good as Leads 
### 
1171 TH the final polishing touches being placed on "Pygmalion," Director
Harold Helvetiston's first, production of the summer, interest in the play
reaches new heights. With the curtain due to rise promptly at eight-thirty
tomorrow night, Director Helvenston pauses momentarily in his labors to
send word to an eagerly awaiting public. "Watch the character parts," says
the director, "they are the best the campus has produced in many a day.
Catherine Crary and Herbert Wenig have especially choice morsels for a
hungry audience. Among the most difficult of feats on the stage is for a
youth to take the part of an aged person. To subdue the vivacity of twenty

• to the faltering steps of sixty is some
[ thing that is rarely accomplished well.
I Miss Crary, as Mrs. Higgins, and ller-
I bert Wenig, as Colonel Pickering, do
this in such an excellent manner that
| there is grave danger that they will
steal the show from the stars.
The voice of the mob is seldom
| considered a lucrative part in any
j play. However, Carl Eardley and Tom
I Pike have injected such life into their
I parts that the mob's voice for once
becomes both pleasing and amusing.
; Despite the brilliance of the subordi
nate parts, the principals must not be
| overlooked. Katherine Keho, as Eliza
: Doolittle, and Irving Rosenblatt, as
\ Henry Higgins, may be depended
upon to give their usual line perform
■ ances.
First Act Is Hard
I The action of Shaw's travesty on
I the English language "as she is
I spoke" is carried through five fast
j moving acts. Perhaps the most dift'i
! cult act from the standpoint of both
; players and audience is the first. In
I tliis act, Eliza, the flower girl, is in
j troduced in all the glory of her ter
j rible Cockney accent. Miss Keho has
\ gone to great pains to master this
j peculiar accent and perhaps the audi
ence will have to concentrate with
equal determination in order to enjoy
it to the full.
Audience Left Guessing
David Lamson, who will be rem em
i bered from his successes to his gradu
ation, also distinguishes himself in
; his mastery of English colloquialisms.
Higgins, the phonetical expert, ac
complishes wonders and each succes
sive act marks a stage in the rapid
improvement of the little flower girl.
The beautiful tones and bearing of
Eliza in the final act would be a
startling and impossible contrast to
the jargon of the first act if the
changes were not so skillfully inter
woven in the amusing action of the
play. The ending is typical of Shaw
in that it is somewhat abrupt and
leaves the audience to draw its own
conclusions as to the future action
and the real ultimate end.

I The action of Shaw's travesty on
I the English language "as she is
I spoke" is carried through five fast
j moving acts. Perhaps the most dift'i
! cult act from the standpoint of both
; players and audience is the first. In
I tliis act, Eliza, the flower girl, is in
j troduced in all the glory of her ter
j rible Cockney accent. Miss Keho has
\ gone to great pains to master this
j peculiar accent and perhaps the audi
ence will have to concentrate with
equal determination in order to enjoy
it to the full.
Audience Left Guessing
David Lamson, who will be rem em
i bered from his successes to his gradu
ation, also distinguishes himself in
; his mastery of English colloquialisms.
Higgins, the phonetical expert, ac
complishes wonders and each succes
sive act marks a stage in the rapid
improvement of the little flower girl.
The beautiful tones and bearing of
Eliza in the final act would be a
startling and impossible contrast to
the jargon of the first act if the
changes were not so skillfully inter
woven in the amusing action of the
play. The ending is typical of Shaw
in that it is somewhat abrupt and
leaves the audience to draw its own
conclusions as to the future action
and the real ultimate end.

Harold Helvetiston's first, production of the summer, interest in the play
reaches new heights. With the curtain due to rise promptly at eight-thirty
tomorrow night, Director Helvenston pauses momentarily in his labors to
send word to an eagerly awaiting public. "Watch the character parts," says
the director, "they are the best the campus has produced in many a day.
Catherine Crary and Herbert Wenig have especially choice morsels for a
hungry audience. Among the most difficult of feats on the stage is for a
youth to take the part of an aged person. To subdue the vivacity of twenty
