# HELVENSTON TRIUMPHS IN PRODUCTION OF PYGMALION
## 
### Rose Marie Smith 
Shaw's clever satire upon the hap
piness of the undeserving poor as
contrasted with the weighing respon
sibility of the middle class was skill
fully interpreted before an unusually
large audience in the Assembly Hall
Friday evening at the Dramatic Coun
cil's performance of "Pygmalion."
Much credit is due Harold Helven
ston, the director, as "Pygmalion" is
a drama ordinarily produced only by
the most experienced professional
players, because of the difficulty
which most actors have in mastering
the cockney accent. The production
showed careful attention to all the
details of a finished performance.
Each actor presented a particularly
accurate characterization of his indi
vidual part. Stover's setting for the
first act proved to be an trfiginal
achievement in the art of stagecraft.
Keho Scores Hit
Katherine Keho was outstand
ing throughout the drama in the
leading role of Ihe flower girl, Eliza
Doolittle. Both she and David Lam
son. who played the part of Alfred
Doolittle, her father, showed a re
markable mastery of the Cockney ac
cent.
Irving Rosenblatt, who played the
leading part of Henry Higgins, gave
an excellent portrayal of the self-cen
tered, erratic professor of phonetics
whose life was spent in gathering and
classifying dialects without a thought
about human emotions. He shows his
incompetency to deal with actual
life; after lie has taught the flower
girl to speak and act like a lady, he
expects her to lie satisfied to go back

to her old life at the successful com
pletion of his experiment.
Humor was added to the play by
!\lrs. Pearoe, the outspoken house
keeper of Professor Higgins, who was
admirably played by Jessie Fleming.
Her determination that the flower
girl shall Ik; brought up properly
leads to many amusing situations.
Crary Plays Mother
The part of Mrs. Higgins, Ihe moth
lor of Henry Higgins and a true lady,
j was charmingly interpreted by Kali
| <;riii«* Crary. Her graciousness and
j human understanding prevail through
out the drama as Shaw's conception
of true culture.
Claire Pearce, Gertrude Neill, and
Harlan Adams, who appeared as mem
bers of the Kynsford Hill family,
i gave an accurate picture of impover-
I ished gentry in England. Herbert
Wenig showed unusual ability as
Colonel Pickering, a sympathetic old
gentleman who, because of his inter
est in the dialects of India, makes
'the acquaintance of Professor Dig
| gins and finally succeeds in helping
! him If) see the life of Eliza Doolittle
i as more than just an experiment.
Ann Adams played the serene maid
[of Mrs. Higgins and a sarcastic by
stander was depicted by Tom Pike.
Another bystander was played by
[ Carl Eardley. Those in the street
J scene included: Thelma Lee Amnions,
; Ellen Peters, Constance Morse. Doro
thea Hawkins, Dorothy Johnston, Isa
bel Warren, Charles Daehtler, Joseph
Sloss, Glenn Lindahl, Richard Quig-
Iley. Jack Lowson, Vernon Cordry, Ar
| tliilr Scharff, Harold Mnrston, and
Joseph Wolf.

a drama ordinarily produced only by
the most experienced professional
players, because of the difficulty
which most actors have in mastering
the cockney accent. The production
showed careful attention to all the
details of a finished performance.
Each actor presented a particularly
accurate characterization of his indi
vidual part. Stover's setting for the
first act proved to be an trfiginal
achievement in the art of stagecraft.
Keho Scores Hit
Katherine Keho was outstand
ing throughout the drama in the
leading role of Ihe flower girl, Eliza
Doolittle. Both she and David Lam
son. who played the part of Alfred
Doolittle, her father, showed a re
markable mastery of the Cockney ac
cent.
Irving Rosenblatt, who played the
leading part of Henry Higgins, gave
an excellent portrayal of the self-cen
tered, erratic professor of phonetics
whose life was spent in gathering and
classifying dialects without a thought
about human emotions. He shows his
incompetency to deal with actual
life; after lie has taught the flower
girl to speak and act like a lady, he
expects her to lie satisfied to go back

to her old life at the successful com
pletion of his experiment.
Humor was added to the play by
!\lrs. Pearoe, the outspoken house
keeper of Professor Higgins, who was
admirably played by Jessie Fleming.
Her determination that the flower
girl shall Ik; brought up properly
leads to many amusing situations.
Crary Plays Mother
The part of Mrs. Higgins, Ihe moth
lor of Henry Higgins and a true lady,
j was charmingly interpreted by Kali
| <;riii«* Crary. Her graciousness and
j human understanding prevail through
out the drama as Shaw's conception
of true culture.
Claire Pearce, Gertrude Neill, and
Harlan Adams, who appeared as mem
bers of the Kynsford Hill family,
i gave an accurate picture of impover-
I ished gentry in England. Herbert
Wenig showed unusual ability as
Colonel Pickering, a sympathetic old
gentleman who, because of his inter
est in the dialects of India, makes
'the acquaintance of Professor Dig
| gins and finally succeeds in helping
! him If) see the life of Eliza Doolittle
i as more than just an experiment.
Ann Adams played the serene maid
[of Mrs. Higgins and a sarcastic by
stander was depicted by Tom Pike.
Another bystander was played by
[ Carl Eardley. Those in the street
J scene included: Thelma Lee Amnions,
; Ellen Peters, Constance Morse. Doro
thea Hawkins, Dorothy Johnston, Isa
bel Warren, Charles Daehtler, Joseph
Sloss, Glenn Lindahl, Richard Quig-
Iley. Jack Lowson, Vernon Cordry, Ar
| tliilr Scharff, Harold Mnrston, and
Joseph Wolf.
Shaw's clever satire upon the hap
piness of the undeserving poor as
contrasted with the weighing respon
sibility of the middle class was skill
fully interpreted before an unusually
large audience in the Assembly Hall
Friday evening at the Dramatic Coun
cil's performance of "Pygmalion."
Much credit is due Harold Helven
ston, the director, as "Pygmalion" is
a drama ordinarily produced only by
the most experienced professional
players, because of the difficulty
which most actors have in mastering
