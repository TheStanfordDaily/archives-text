# GODUNOV SUBJECT OF DOWNES IN RUSSIAN LECTURE YESTERDAY
## 
### 
"Boris Godunov" was the subject of
the lecture delivered yesterday at (lie
Little Theatre by Olin Downes, music
critic of the "New York Times."
"Moris Godunov," Mr. Downes be
lieves, "is the most completely Rus
sian opera ever produced by a
Russian composer." Originally in
spired by the interest of a Neo-Rus
sian group of musicians, this opera
portrays the Russian national spirit,
breaking away from the influence of
French and Italian operas which had
hitherto dominated Russian musical
productions.
i lie tragic history of Boris Godunov
is (old in the opera with all the power
which combined musical and dramatic
genius can produce. Boris is an
usurper supposed to have murdered
tlie young heir to the throne. After a
tempestuous rule of terror and dis
sension at the advent of a pretender,
Boris dies. This simple plot centers
about two ideas: the unhappy Boris,
and ihe background of the Russian
people; the suffering of the ruler, and
the suffering of the ruled.
So striking and powerful was the
appeal of this opera, that the authori
ties, probably actuated by political
motives, at first refused to allow it
to be acted without revision. Mis
shapen and mutilated, the opera
finally struggled forth to public view,
and by inherent force it survived, de
spite iis crippled condition. "In its
late," said Mr. Downes, "one can find
an analogy to the fate and fortune of
Russia, its native land. It has survived
through all difficulties, inchoate,
huge, tremendously elemental, with
the whole vast land behind it, and
yet about it there is something un
finished, something which apparently
cannot find its way."
The first lecture in Mr. Downes'
series was "Music and devolution as
Seen In Soviet Russia Today," de
livered last Thursday evening. "Boris
Godunov" is the second lecture of the
series.
