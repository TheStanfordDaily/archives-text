# COMFORT IN THE CLASSROOM
## 
### 
Some time ago a professor in an Eastern university initiated an ex
periment which attracted wide attention at the time. Ii was his idea that
the modern classroom should be as comfortable as the modern theater
il ihe iormer was to meet the competition of the latter. The professor
proceeded to test this idea by having lii> classroom equipped with com
lortable upholstered chairs.
It is plainly evident that the professor's idea was very radical, for
from time immemorial it has been the rule to make the seat of learning
a seat ol torture. In our early school history the benches* were made of
rough slabs of wood and it was lett to successive generations of pupils
to smooth and polish them by constant use. Today the seats are practi
cally the same as those ol centuries ago with the slight improvement that
some ol the smoothing and polishing is- done hv others than students.
It has been said that the reason professors stand is not because of anv
advantage in presenting their lectures but because they have found it
less wearing.
Objections to com tort for students have been voiced on the ground
that the hard and uncomfortable seats are part of the necessarv discipline
of the classroom and Jhat with comfortable seats there would be a far
greater number of class sleepers than there is at present. To the former
it is sufficient to answer that the old hickory stick was also a part of
classroom discipline. A good professor, so many avow, is one who can
keep his students so interested that they will forget that they are in a
classroom. Hut why, it may be asked, should one desire to forget that
one is in a classroom. - ' Just think of how much less energv the professor
would have to exert if he were not working against such odds.
I hen there is the matter of economy. Perhaps von know that the
two-trousers suit is a direct result of the universal use of the hard wooden
classroom chairs. Hundreds of thousands of mothers were on the verge
of revolt when the two-trousers idea removed the necessity of millions
of patches, ft is true that the indestructible cords of the Stanford Rough
have partially solved the problem on our campus.
Leather-upholstered chairs in classrooms will work for economy in
these days of elimination of all waste —economy of clothing, of effort and
of attention required gain the heart and meat of the professors' wisdom.
