# INK RESERVOIR DRY
## 
### 
The ink reservoir in the library has I>een dried up. Busy note-takers
cannot now dash into the little room off the main lobby and till their
lonntain pens from the ever-flowing spring that the I'niversity main
lained. Somebody has been altogether too free with the free ink supplv,
and for the safeguarding of walls and floors there was nothing else to
be done than to close the ])lace.
May be some better protected and less conspicuous location can be
lound for this convenience which the librarian is eager to make available,
but lor the time being, at least, students must provide their own ink or
use pencils.
It i> hard to believe that any persons of the age and the l() rating
necessary for admission to Stanford as students have been guilt}' of the
â€¢ Jiildish carelessnes sthat has been exhibited recentlv. Hut. whoever thev
are. ihey make all users of the librar\ suffer for their impossible conduct.
