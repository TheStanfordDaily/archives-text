# SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A TRUISM
## 
### 
A recent news dispatch carries the interesting information that
psychologists have discovered that the grammar needs of school students
may vary \fter some experimentation and thought they are nearlv ready
to state definitely that grammatical instruction should be fitted to the in
dividual student.
I he story reads: "I'rielly. the viewpoint of these psychologists is this:
I"it grammatical instruction to the individual student. What is grammati
cal food lor one type of pupil, is poison for another type. In other words,
grammar is not a simple subject to be taught in the same manner to
everybody. It is a mental reaction and must be modified for different
mentalities. Some pupils get the mastery of the nouns, but not of verbs
or adjectives, others are mentally shaped in other patterns."
X'o doubt educators will read the ston with a smile. It will amuse
them, not because it is an improbable fact, but because it is such a well
known fact to them. Any school man who has kept in touch with educa
tion at all the last ten or fifteen years has heard many times such phrases '
as "individual differences." and "suiting the instruction to meet individual '
needs.' They are accepted as an established method of educational j
technique.
If the news story gave an accurate report of the work of the j
psychologists, they have just made a discovery that educational research
made quite awhile ago. I'eachers had believed it even longer. And when
intelligence tests confirmed what people long suspected—that the intelli
gence of human beings varies in quality and quantity—those engaged in '
school work realized that the method of giving each student identical j
iraining was unfair and inefficient. Immediatelv there began a reorganiza- j
lion of teaching methods and administration. \s far as possible instruc
tion was adapted to meet individual differences.
In the field of grammar alone there are many tests devised to do ,
exactly what these psychologists suggest, diagnose the weaknesses and j
strength of both individuals and groups. ' )bviouslv if such a test reveals
that the group has an adequate knowledge of the use of nouns but an
incomplete knowledge of verbs, instruction will be adapted to meet the
latter need.
Scientists in other fields are apt to forget that educators are interested
in other things than teaching methods. Education is a science that is!
developing an increasing number of research workers. The psychologists ,
may do well to read some of the contributions to knowledge made bv >
school men.
