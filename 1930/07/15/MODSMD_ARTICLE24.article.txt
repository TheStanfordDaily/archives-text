Just took ii trip to Yosemite Valley
this paHt week-end.
! A wonderful trip except for the
i heat at times.
Speaking of heat.
1 Had a little heated argument with
! one of these policemen who ride on
motorcycles.
I know I wasn't going a hit over
sixty miles an hour.
He's crazy.
So are all cops.
However, I now know where most
|of the Stanford student body spend
j their summers.
I
And dancing—whew!
Read in the papers the other day
| that one of the San Francisco crema
toriums was condemned.
!
Tliere was no 'fire escape, probably.
Hnap-snap-snap, chew, snap-snap,
Chew-chew-snap, chew, snap-snap.
, Snap-suap-chew-snap.
Etc.
i In order to get the proper effect for
! the above, it is necessary to procure
I some gum from the Union, (adv.)
Then go to class where the lecture
is particularly dry and put the gum
in your mouth and work 'em in the
! above rhythm to the tune of our na-
I tional anthem.
All seriousness aside, though.
Gum-chewing is not being done this
(season in the most polite society.
Or any other season.
It is an art and accomplishment for
| stenographers, alone.
I
No reflection on the stenographers,
of course. Reference is to poor steno
graphers, not good ones.
There are a few fraternities (names
on request) that are running tables
this summer and also rooming visi
tors.
i
Of course this is not illegal rushing.
But next spring when rushing sea
! son is in full swing and pledging
[ takes place, it is very strange to see
| many or the men who lived at the
| frats during the summer pledge those
! houses.
| Just an old Spanish custom!
The other day the geology class
went on a field trip.
And the professor asked one of the
students how a certain rock got
I there.
The student replied that a glacier
I had brought it down.
( The prof looked around surprised
' and asked where was the glacier.
And the Stanford frosh replied'that
the glacier had gone back for another
'rock.

| Just an old Spanish custom!
The other day the geology class
went on a field trip.
And the professor asked one of the
students how a certain rock got
I there.
The student replied that a glacier
I had brought it down.
( The prof looked around surprised
' and asked where was the glacier.
And the Stanford frosh replied'that
the glacier had gone back for another
'rock.
