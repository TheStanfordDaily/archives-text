# SYMPHONIC POEM BY RABAUD PLAYED AT ORCHESTRA CONCERT
## 
### 
From the standpoint of interpretive
art the symphonic poem. "La Proces
sion Nocturne," by Rabaud, was the
most impressive number on Sunday
afternoon's concert by the San Frau
j cisco Symphony Orchestra under the
, direction of Gaetano Merola at the
! Woodland Theatre.
The composition opens with a pic
ture of a dark and foreboding forest
with heavy and somber clouds hang
ing close to the tree tops. Faust is
doomed to pass through the forest.
He sees a vision of a procession of
singers ranging from young children
to old and feeble men and women.
This procession represents the entire
ty of a happy life. As it passes by,
Faust is left alone again to bitterly
lament his sorrowful existence.
Six of the compositions on the pro
-1 gram had never been played before
at the Hillsborough concerts. These
included Rameau's Suite for Orel'.'
i tra, the Rabaud Symphonic, l'oem, "La
Procession Nocturne," Suite No. I
