The need of leaders in industry who
carry their Christianity into business
was stressed by t lie Rev. Charles R.
Brown of Yale University, speaking
Sunday in the Memorial Church. He
declared that the whole 'industrial
problem is a moral one.
"Until we have industrial leaders
whose inner life is right, the big dogs
will continue to get all the big bones,
while the small dogs stand around
waiting to get what's lert," said Rev.
Brown.
"The nineteenth century was the
age of the atom; the twentieth cen
tury already gives evidence that it
is to be the age of the spirit. As rep
resentative of the movement, Rev.
Brown pointed out the attitude of
Millikan and the service of the mod
ern social worker.
Moses was given an example of a
great Christian leader. He lacked all
self-consciousness. His social vision
was evidenced in that he saw the ob
ligation of serving God by serving his
fellow beings. He possessed a spirit
of self-sacrifice; and manifested a far
reaching purpose by providing for his
people not only bread and butter, but
the spiritual life necessary in any
social order.
"The Christian life," concluded Rev.
Brown, "is not dull and drab; it is
the most radiant thing the sun shines
on."
Rev. Brown will preach at the Me
morial Church again next Sunday.
