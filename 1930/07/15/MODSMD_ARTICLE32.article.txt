# Navajo Indian Sand Painting Is Rare Piece in University Museum
## 
### 
A Navajo Indian sand painting—
I perhaps the only one possessed by
I any. University museum—is one of the
prized possessions of the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum.
"Such a painting is a rare thing for
any museum to have," says Frank B.
Lemos of the museum staff, "since it
becomes necessary for the Indian
painter to he at the museum to pro
duce his work of art. Such a painting
cannot he transported."
This painting was given to Stan
ford for educational purposes by the
I Indians as a mark of appreciation of
the University's interest in their work.
It was made two years ago when three
Navajo and two Zuni Indians visited
Stanford through the efforts of Pedro
Lemos, director of the museum, when
some 5,000 people learned of various
| epochs of Indian life.
A Religious Ceremony
Not alone because of the difficulty of
transporting the painting is it a rare
collection, but also because there is
a feeling amounting almost to a pro
hibition among the Indians that a sand
painting shall not leave the tribe. It
is a part of «t heir religious ceremonial.
There are different ceremonials for
different occasions.
Before the ceremony, for example,
; of "The Mountain Chant," the medicine
man equips himself with leather hags
and journeys to "The Sacred Moun

] tain." On top of this he spreads his
! bags and pours into them the different
i colored sands which lie finds there in
j abundance.
J Having gathered J lie red, blue, and
j yellow sands into life pouches, he ties
j them with leather thongs, and with
I much prayer to his God, lie returns
to his people. At one o'clock on the
] afternoon of the day of the ceremony
the floor of Medicine .Lodge is cleaned
ami the sand painting is begun. The
I work is done under constant direction
'of the medicine man.

A Navajo Indian sand painting—
I perhaps the only one possessed by
I any. University museum—is one of the
prized possessions of the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum.
"Such a painting is a rare thing for
any museum to have," says Frank B.
Lemos of the museum staff, "since it
becomes necessary for the Indian
painter to he at the museum to pro
duce his work of art. Such a painting
cannot he transported."
This painting was given to Stan
ford for educational purposes by the
I Indians as a mark of appreciation of
the University's interest in their work.
It was made two years ago when three
Navajo and two Zuni Indians visited
Stanford through the efforts of Pedro
Lemos, director of the museum, when
some 5,000 people learned of various
| epochs of Indian life.
A Religious Ceremony
Not alone because of the difficulty of
transporting the painting is it a rare
collection, but also because there is
a feeling amounting almost to a pro
hibition among the Indians that a sand
painting shall not leave the tribe. It
is a part of «t heir religious ceremonial.
There are different ceremonials for
different occasions.
Before the ceremony, for example,
; of "The Mountain Chant," the medicine
man equips himself with leather hags
and journeys to "The Sacred Moun

] tain." On top of this he spreads his
! bags and pours into them the different
i colored sands which lie finds there in
j abundance.
J Having gathered J lie red, blue, and
j yellow sands into life pouches, he ties
j them with leather thongs, and with
I much prayer to his God, lie returns
to his people. At one o'clock on the
] afternoon of the day of the ceremony
the floor of Medicine .Lodge is cleaned
ami the sand painting is begun. The
I work is done under constant direction
'of the medicine man.
