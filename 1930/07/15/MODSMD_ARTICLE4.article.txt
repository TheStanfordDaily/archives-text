# FORGOTTEN HASH MESSES HASHERS' PLANS FOR PICNIC
## 
### 
A doften couples, Ruble Hall
hasher picnickers, decided to en
joy an evening at a certain
beach thirty-two miles from (lie
Farm. Twelve dollars bought a
selection of food destined to re
lieve the hungry group around
a campfire last Saturday eve
ning.
One of I lie several automobiles
was - to have charge of three
choice watermelons, another
car was to take the rest of the
food.
Once at the beach, they looked
about for something to eat —
they were all very much fam
ished, according to the admis
sion of one member of the party
—but, unfortunately, the sand
wiches, the watermelons, in fact,
not a single morsel was to be
found.
It developed that the car con
taining tlio watermelons had
gone to tlie wrong beach. The
rest of the lunch was stored
away neatly in the lunch-baskets
at Roble —each driver thought
the other haul the food. It became
a picnic without anything to eat.
Sunday evening the hashers
had another picnic. It was held
at Searsville, and this time they
had something to eat!
