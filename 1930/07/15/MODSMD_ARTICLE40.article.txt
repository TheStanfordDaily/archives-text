# PROHIBITION CASES INVOLVE MANY OTHER CRIMES SAYS MORGAN

### 
That the Hoover Crime Commis
sion became largely a matter of poli
tics during the last session of Con
gress is the belief of Professor E. M.
Morgan, of the Harvard Law School,
j who is acting professor of law at
Stanford during the summer quarter.
The threatened curtailment of the
Crime Commission's work to tlie in
vestigation only of the prohibition
problem would have been an impos
sible condition, according to Professor
Morgan. "Only a very limited investi
gation of prohibition problems could
be made without bringing in almost
every other type of law violation," he
' said.
The attempted curtailment of llie
'Crime Commission's activities was in
reality the work of vafious politicians
for the purpose of killing tlie Com
mission. Both the Wets and the Drys
are afraid to face the facts, because
their political platforms are so essen
tially involved in the issue, the pro-
I feasor believes.
Professor Morgan also declared that
i the work of the Crime Commission
i could only proceed slowly because of
j the laborious task of investigation. "It
took four years to make a thorough
| survey of Boston alone," said Morgan,
who is a member of the Harvard Law
School Commission which made a sur
vey of Boston crime conditions; "so
that it would be at least ten or fifteen
years before a representative number
| of sections of the United States could
be investigated.
"Even when the Crime Commission
has completed its investigations a
method of alleviating conditions must
be determined. Opposed to common
belief, this cannot, be accomplished
by processes which may have proved
successful in other countries. England,
for example, can solve many of her
( crime problems by the proper process
r of national appeal, while it seems that
it is necessary for the United States
ito use force," he said. "The reason
i for this difference lies in the great
j influence of the foreign element in
our country as opposed to the homo
| geneous population of England.
