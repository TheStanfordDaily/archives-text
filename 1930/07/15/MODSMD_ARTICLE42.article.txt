During the past week-end a few of
the matches wore played with no
startling upsets. In the only first

In the second-round matches that
were run off during the last few days,
I*. Fries defeated \V. 1-lathoway, G-l,
li-4; V. Ricketts defeated P. Cham
berlain, 0-3, 5-7, fi-3; and W. Clark de
feated R. Thorup, 6-3, 6-3.
('lark experienced no difficulty, but
Iticketts and Fries were hard put to
win their matches. Although the
scores do not indicate u close contest,
Fries found iiathoway a stubborn foe
in their second set, many of the
games going to deuce several times.
However, the winner held the upper
hand throughout, being slightly more
consistent with his driving.
Ricketts beat Chamberlain, hut. it
was only after the score was one set
apiece. The first set went to the win
ner without much effort, but the sec
ond and third rounds would have been
disastrous except, for the steadier
service and volley of Ricketts.
There are six first-round singles,
and twenty-three more second-round
matches to be played before Satur
day. In the doubles championship no
matches have been played to date,
and 101 wyn Btigge, director of the

championship will have his name en
graved on this perpetual award.
