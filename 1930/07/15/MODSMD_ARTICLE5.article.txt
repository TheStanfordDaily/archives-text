# SPAIN'S PROGRESS IN TWENTIETH CENTURY IS SOLALINDE'S TOPIC
## 
### 
That Spain's remarkable progress
in tho twentieth century is due to
natural growth and not to dictator
ships is the belief of Professor An
tonio G. Solalinde, acting professor
of Spanish, who spoke in the Little
Theatre last night. The lecture, de
livered in Spanish, was on "Present
Conditions in Spain."
"During the nineteenth -century,"
Professor Solalinde explained, "the
country was so disturbed by revolu
tions and wars that progress was
much retarded. But during the twen
tieth century peace was established
and the natural growth of the coun
try continued. The people were tired
of revolutions. A dictatorship meant
stability and therefore was not. op
posed because people wanted to go
to work without danger of disturb
ance."
Mining and textiles, the two great
est industries of Spain, are having
an excellent growth, he continued.
There is a decided increase in both
imports and exports. The World War
did much to develop industries with
in Spain. When the country was
thrown on its own resources the peo
ple discovered they could do many
things they hadn't done before.
"We . could live," Professor Sola
linde said, "entirely within our own
borders without receiving any outside
help, if we had to." He illustrated his
lecture with slides showing scenes of
Andalucia, Granada, the Alhambra,
Seville, and Honda.
At a lecture to be delivered later
in the summer in English, Professor
Solalinde will discuss tin* political
situation in present- day Spain.
