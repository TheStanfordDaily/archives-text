## 
### 
j A file of inky footprints leading
I away from a securely locked door!
I Students staring blankly at a barred
j portal. Tiie library "filling station"
i had been padlocked.
Prompt inquiry followed. Secrecy
! cloaked the ink room with interest.
| And then, upon examination, the truth
i was discovered.
''The library is eager to furnish
1 this convenience to students," an
nounced Nathan Van Patten, director
I of the library, to a Daily reporter yes
terday, "hut the carelessness of a few
individuals which has resulted in dis
figuring the building in so conspicu
ous a place has made that location
impossible. The ink room has been
closed while it is being determined
what shall be done."
