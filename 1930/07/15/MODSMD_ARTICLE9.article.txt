### 
According to newspaper dispatches,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, with
Mrs. Wilbur, left Washington Friday
for the West. Washington reports
state that they will go directly to
"The Cedars," the Wilbur summer
home on the north fork of the Ameri
can river, where Mrs. Wilbur will
probably spend most of the summer.
Dr. Wilbur's trip West, say Wash
ington dispatches, is on official busi
ness on behalf of oil conservation, lie
will be authorized by Congress to
enter into unit operations agreements
for the development of the Kettleman
Hills oil field, a plan which he hopes
will be generally adopted by pro
ducers.
At the president's office on the cam
pus no definite information about Dr.
Wilbur's arrival or his immediate
plans was available.
