# FUN FOR PROFIT
## 
### 
Roble's Countrv Fair tomorrow niy'lit does not need anv pleas for a
" . . *
big attendance. The dance-alone makes it an evening that will be enjoyed 112
by a large number without any further ballyhoo.
Just the same, the spirit of 11 it* women of the I'Diversity in going i
about securing a fund for furnishing their new gymnasium now under
construction does call for a word "of appreciation, even though their i
Fair can stand on its own feet and wotdd be a success even if it had no I
profit-making motive behind it. The women are satisfied to put all the
money from the Hoard of Athletic Control into the gymnasium building
itself, and themselves raise money as they can for its embellishment.'
All by themselves, the Roble women had an entertainment the other j
veiling and raised fifty dollars for the furniture fund. Thev should gain
considerably more tomorrow with tin's more ambitious program and the]
whole student body as patrons.
Those who go to the Fair need not be millionaires. A few dimes i
are evidently all that are needed â€”say about twenty. Fewer will do, but
more might be spent. Those who would gladly spend a dollar or two to
attend an informal dance such as Roble is providing can spend it and
get a lot of entertainment in addition to the dance. Those who want to
spend less can do it and have a good time just the same.
