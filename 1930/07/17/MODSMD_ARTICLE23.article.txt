# CELLAR MUST MEET EXPENSES
## 
### 
If Stanford students in the summer quarter reap some of the oft
recounted advantages of a comparatively small college, they face now a j
counterbalancing inconvenience in the likelihood of the closing of the i
Cellar in the evening when the student population is further decreased
with the departure of those who arc registered only for the first half of j
th quarter.
The manager of the Cnion dining facilities says that there is a strong j
probability that there will not be during the second half of the quarter'
sufficient patronage to permit the Cellar to be operated after dark. That i
is too bad, for a considerable number do lind the opportunity to get a
throat-cooling ice or a brain-awakening cup of coffee in the evening I
(xtremely acceptable, and I'alo Alto is pretty far awav for that sort of
thing at that time of day. I Jut nobody can justly demand that the Cellar
be kept open as a pure charity. If the place can break even financially
it ought to be kept running, but if it cannot there seems to be no j
alternative to shutting down.
.Maybe those who will seriously regret the closing of the Cellar in !
the evening might start a movement for increased consumption of |
Mindaes and chocs there between dinner time and 11 o'clock as an enter
prise for the general welfare. (iet up a slogan, have a pledge campaign,
see that all who sign up to spend money in the Cellar after nightfall
keep their promises, stick untiringly on the job, flunk out at the end of '
the quarter. Hut think of the satisfaction of perishing in a noble light!'
Anyhow, paying patronage would keep the Cellar open: lack of
patronage will close it-- doors.
