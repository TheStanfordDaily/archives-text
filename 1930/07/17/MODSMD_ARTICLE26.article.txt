"Mother," said Mrs. Burkhold, "had
to sleep on the beaches all night with
the savages who became very inter
ested in her work and assisted in col
lecting the shells."
Sleepy Sam, noting this paragraph
in the Daily's account of the gift of
ihe Burkhold collection to Stanford,
wants to know if the collection in
cludes the three shells made famous
in the "old army game."

wrong shell.
And were afraid to go home. So

Stanford.
The opening of Eric Krenz's new
putt-putt, golf course gives Paly an

You read about the young chap who
lives on an island for five dollars a
week.
Alcatraz, for instance.
Stanford men might live for five
dollars a week
On an island.
Not at Stanford.
Unless Ihey starve.
Or borrow cigarettes.

"Two dollars fine for the return of
any check for any reason whatsoever."

living expenses.
Not ordinary living expenses—NO!
Because you remember (his chap
lived like a millionaire.
Can't afford to live like a million
aire. Taxes too heavy.
Can't live like a millionaire at Stan
ford on five dollars a week, anyhow.
Oh. let's go to the island!
