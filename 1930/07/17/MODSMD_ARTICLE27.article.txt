# LEADERSHIP QUALITIES TOLD BY THORPE AT SECRETARIES' SCHOOL
## 
### 
"A good leader must be able to
visualize, organize, deputize, and
supervise." Thus did Merle Thorpe,
editor of "Nation's Business," speak
ing to the School for Commercial
Secretaries, Tuesday, sum up the
(pialities of leadership.
"The first quality of a leader is
that he possess the ability to see a
thing completed before it is started,"
said Thorpe. "He must think in terms
of 1935 instead of July, 1930. When a
man sees far ahead he speeds up and
nearby objects do not loom up out
of proportion to their importance.
When 1 was a freshman at Stanford,
Dr. David Starr Jordan, in a talk to
freshmen, quoted an old Italian prov
erb that 1 have never forgotten. ft is
this: 'The world will step aside to let
pass the man who knows where lie
is going.'"
Real Leader Foresees Difficulties
Continuing, Thorpe said that the
difference between a successful and
an unsuccessful leader often lay in
the word "if." The real leader is pre
pared for any contingency. He fore
sees unexpected difficulties and
changes. He acts quickly. He keeps
his poise. Quickness of action inspires
the confidence of his friends and dis
mays his enemies.
The second quality of leadership
mentioned is the ability to organize
or "bring into a working whole many
diverse parts." Likening a good leßder
to one building a house he explained
that after a house has been planned,
the next thing is to delegate the vari
ous kinds-of work to be done to the
right workers. In addition to systema
tizing, the ability to organize includes
the ability, to man or equip an or
ganization with the working power.
Leader Stays in Background
Closely related to the ability to
choose the right men is the ability
to supervise intelligently the work to
bn done, Thorpe said. "A leader must
be able to criticize without offending
and to praise without spoiling. One
man must be the directing genius of
any organization. He will probably
be in the background, if be is a great
leader, but his influence will be t'«lt
throughout his organization. The day
when leaders ride out in front of the
ranks on white chargers is past."
In the final part of bis lecture,
Thorpe applied tlie qualities of lead
ership he had mentioned to tin- prob
lems of the chamber of commerce
secretaries who were listening to him.
He showed how a man possessing
these qualities would approach typical
chamber of commerce problems.
His lecture, full of incidents from
his own experience and made force
iul by characteristic epigrams, was
well attended.
