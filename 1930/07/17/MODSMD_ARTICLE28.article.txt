j Summer quarter students may be
| fewer than those during the rest of
the year, but summer quarter appe
tites exceed those of the reputedly
| hungry winter months. According to
records which were kept during t li« j
j past week by Miss Hilda Longyear,
assistant manager of the Union, the (
food consumed during a week at the
Union cafeteria, dining room, and the
Cellar consisted of ihe same amount
as during a normal week in any other
quarter, and fed a smaller number 1
! of people.
In the past week, 1960 half-pint bot
tles of milk and 70 quarts of butter
milk were drunk, while 170 gallons
of milk w.ere used in cooking. Eggs
| are fairly popular, 210 dozen being;
used, while 190 pounds of butter and
130 gallons of ice cream were de
voured by summer quarter Cardinals.
For the benefit of those who bewail
the lack of balance in such a diet,
jMiss Longyear adds that :»"> gallons]
of orange juice and 10 gallons of
1 grapefruit juice were included, and
f.G heads of lettuce added their vita
mines, not to mention the cases of
fruits and vegetables which were not
recorded.
The more carniverous of Stanford's ,
sons disposed of 12f>7 pounds of meat •
'and fish in the week.
According to Miss Longyear, the i
dining room and cafeteria share popu
larity honors, the cafeteria drawing
larger crowds at noon, and the dining
room attracting larger numbers at
night. The total number served in a
■day is approximately the same in
;each.
