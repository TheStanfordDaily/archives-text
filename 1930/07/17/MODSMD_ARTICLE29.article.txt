San Francisco is one of "three big i
â– cities in the United States that are
I 'story cities,' and it is tiie best of the j
I lot," in the opinion of Frank Norris.
j Those who go on the week-end ex-,
! cursion Saturday, starting at 8:30 j
i from the Union and returning about;
4 o'clock in the afternoon, will have
an opportunity to understand some
j of (lie color and charm that make the
! Bay city "the best."
I Reservations for the trip must be
made two days in advance, either at
| the Fortune Yellow Cab Co. on the
j Circle, at the guide stations on the ]
I campus, or with Miss Lois White at i
j Roble Hall. Fare will be $3 for trans- I

is one of the memorable sights of the j
