# GROWTH OF SORBONNE DEPICTED BY MORAUD IN TUESDAY LECTURE
## 
### 
"Facts about the University of
Paris, which lias had a long and varied
career, are lost in the dust of the
iitfes," declared Professor Marcel
Moraud of Rice Institute, visiting
French professor during tlie summer
quarter, in his lecture Tuesday night
in the Little Theatre on "The Uni
versity of Paris."
"The University began to grow in
the shadow of (he old church of Notre
Dame," he continued. "It was known
as the cathedral school of Notre
I mine and its teachers were appointed
by I lie bishop."
Sorborine Founded For Poor
In the twelfth century, the cathe
dral school became famous, mainly be
en use of its (wo noted teachers, Cham
peay and Abelard. So many students
(locked to hear these teachers that
quarrels soon broke out between them
and the citizens of Paris. When Abel
aril came to strife with the Church
authorities, many of his students fol
lowed him to the left bank of the
Seine and there established an inde
pendent I'niversitas, or gild of .stu
dents and teachers.
In the Middle Ages the suffering of
poverty-stricken students was intense,
declared Professor Moraud. it was in
I^7J that, Robert de Sorborine, who
had once been a student in Paris,
founded the Sorbonne, where poor
students might he comfortably fed
and housed. Later, lectures were
given at the Sorbonne, and gradually
it developed into die most famous and
powerful school in all Europe.
Revolution Closes University
The Sorbonne, which had once been
powerful enough to dictate (o the
Pope, was brought low by the Revo
hit ion. Its library was scattered and
its classes closed. Jn 1831 it was
again established, and in twenty years
was once more the center of learning
and liberal thought in Europe. Ever
since it has been a lodestone for the
intellectually elite. Since the war,
however, times have been hard for
the students. Poverty and hardship
have been as prevalent as they ever
were in the darkest Middle Ages. Fol
lowing the example of Robert de Sor
bonne. philanthropic rftillionaires have
established living houses for poor stu
dents. "Perhaps some of these houses
may develop into a college as did the
Sorbonne," suggested Professor-
Mora ud.
"So far, however, the Sorbonne re
mains, supreme and unchallenged. It
retains its old standards; it still main
tains that, there is nothing for a
young man like (he contact of humane,
well-trained, and living thought."
