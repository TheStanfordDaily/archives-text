There are many organizations on
this campus that plaster the bulletin
boards and other public places with
.innumerable posters describing their
various activities and then either for
get or neglecjt to remove the eye-sores.
Among them the above were nicked
at random and serve merely as illus
trations of the neglect in removing
out-of-date notices. A glance at any
posting place will reveal many un
sightly and antiquated advertisements
such as a Junior Jolly-Up, Jan. 30,
i scribbled in blue and white chalk on
the steps of the post office and the 1
Bookstore.
The Dramatic Council maintains 1
that there will be a seat sale today
i for the play "Right You Are," but
wrong they are, because the play was
given several months ago and all t.ick
-1 ets must be sold by now, anyway.
i

! Seventy-nine notices of furnished
rooms or houses for rent, on but four
announcement boards were counted.
That is an average of twenty per bul
letin board. For curiosity's sake, two
telephone numbers were called and
the result was that both places had
been let months ago.
Then in Branner Hall on a space
. reserved for Business Announcements,
i a notice read, "Anyone having any
| extra Bin Game tickets please see
me at 142 Branner any evening. Will
, give good price." Open flagrant scalp
ing such as this is bad enough without
leaving the evidence to stare at every
visitor to the hall.
Not long ago there was a contest
| conducted by the Convalescent Home
for the King of the Masque Ball. The
blackboard announcing results of the
vote is still an eye-sore to everyone
I passing it.
There is supposed to be a Univer
sity regulation which requires notice
posters to remove their announce
ments when their usefulness is past,
and a committee was once formed to
i prevent the over-crowding of bulletin
boards, and to prevent out-dated and
unsightly notices from spoiling the
charm of the campus. The idea worked
| well for awhile, hut carelessness can
i undo almost any work well begun.

trations of the neglect in removing
out-of-date notices. A glance at any
posting place will reveal many un
sightly and antiquated advertisements
such as a Junior Jolly-Up, Jan. 30,
i scribbled in blue and white chalk on
the steps of the post office and the 1
Bookstore.
The Dramatic Council maintains 1
that there will be a seat sale today
i for the play "Right You Are," but
wrong they are, because the play was
given several months ago and all t.ick
-1 ets must be sold by now, anyway.

! Seventy-nine notices of furnished
rooms or houses for rent, on but four
announcement boards were counted.
That is an average of twenty per bul
letin board. For curiosity's sake, two
telephone numbers were called and
the result was that both places had
been let months ago.
Then in Branner Hall on a space
. reserved for Business Announcements,
i a notice read, "Anyone having any
| extra Bin Game tickets please see
me at 142 Branner any evening. Will
, give good price." Open flagrant scalp
ing such as this is bad enough without
leaving the evidence to stare at every
visitor to the hall.
Not long ago there was a contest
| conducted by the Convalescent Home
for the King of the Masque Ball. The
blackboard announcing results of the
vote is still an eye-sore to everyone
I passing it.
There is supposed to be a Univer
sity regulation which requires notice
posters to remove their announce
ments when their usefulness is past,
and a committee was once formed to
i prevent the over-crowding of bulletin
boards, and to prevent out-dated and
unsightly notices from spoiling the
charm of the campus. The idea worked
| well for awhile, hut carelessness can
i undo almost any work well begun.
