# ZONING LAWS RESULT IN STABILIZED LAND VALUES SAYS ROGERS

### 
"Over 650 cities containing 70 to 80
per cent of the urban population of j
the United States are now zoned,"
stated Gardener S. Rogers to a iJaily ;
I reporter in an interview yesterday.;
Rogers, assistant manager of the j
civic development department of the j
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States, is giving several lectures be
fore the Western School for Commer- ;
cial Secretaries.
Zoning ordinances regulate the j
height and size of structures, the area
to be occupied by buildings, and the !
• type of businesses or residences that
i can locate in the various sections of
| a city. Zoning ordinances must apply
i to the whole city or they will prob-
I ably be declared unconstitutional.
' savs Mr. Rogers.
One of the most marked effects of
zoning has been the stabilization of
land values. The restriction in the lo
cation of business and industrial en
terprises has stopped the deprecia
tion of residential values. When suf
ficient allowance is made for expan- j
! sion and business facilities, no hard- j
i ship results from restriction.
i Rapidly growing communities real- i
i ize the need of zoning ordinances .
' more quickly than slowly developing '<
! cities. More cities in New York and
New Jersey have provided for zoning
than elsewhere in the United States.
"The problems of traffic and zoning
are closely related. The highways and
arterials section off a city. They are a
large factor in the determination of
property use and business location," j
states Rogers.
The tendency in the East is for
highways to by-pass towns in order
! to avoid the congestion of the main j
business streets. In cities of more
I than 10,000 population it. is a distinct
I disadvantage to have a business
street a through highway. Merchants |
have come to realize that tourists
seldom make a purchase when they
pass through a town and the in
| creased traffic discourages local peo- 1
pie from trading on the main street. !
Rogers complimented Palo Alto on
the Itamona Shops. These shops are
distinctive, attractive, and probably
1 as Economical to construct as the or
dinary store.
