# VAN PATTEN TALKS BEFORE KIWANIANS ON GUTENBERG BIBLE
## 
### 
Printed on a cider press in the
I fifteenth century, tlie Gutenberg Bible
has not been equalled in some re
spects by modern printers, accord
ins to Nathan Van Patten, director oi'
! Stanford University Libraries, who
|,talked Tuesday to the Kiwanis Club
of Palo Alto on "Hare Books." He
! showed pages from this Gutenberg
; Bible.
In addition to the Gutenberg pages,
| Van Patten exhibited other specimens
of books printed during the period
j from 1450 to 1500. Among the rarefies
iin modern books displayed were a
first edition of Hawthorne's "Scarlet
j Letter" in three volumes, valued at
! $2,000; n first edition of Harriet
\ Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
j rebound, valued at $1,800; and two
: treasured volumes of Lewis Carroll's
I "Alice in Wonderland" and "Through
| the Looking Glass." The former was
I a second edition copy, and the latter
a first, edition. There are no first edi-
I tion copies of "Alice in Wonderland,"
Mr. Patten said, because the author,
disliking the first edition plates, gave
i them away to a children's hospital.
Not all of the rare books coveted
'by collectors are antiquities, Mr. Van
i Patten said. First editions of modern
works are also in demand and com
! mand big prices.
