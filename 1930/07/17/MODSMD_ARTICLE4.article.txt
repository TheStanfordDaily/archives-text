### 
Ethel Livingston will play the role)
j of Lil Rice, the raucous prima donna j
whose good looks have long since j
lost their bloom, in "Broadway," a
| drama of "Main Street," New York,
which will be produced on the campus
the evening of August 1.
There has been a reversal of two of
the leading parts, according to an an
nouncement made by Harold Helven
ston yesterday. The important role of
j the chorus girl. Pearl, which requires
a great deal of emotional interpreta
| tion, will be played by Catherine
j Crary. Nellie May Chapman will en
! act the part of Billie Moore, the sweet
{and unsophisticated girl of the troupe.
There are four distinct types of
I typical Chicago gunmen in the melo
! drama. These will he chosen from the
following list of names: A 1 Miller,
Tom Pike, Ben Kagan, Glen Lindahl,
and Herbert Jones, and announced to
night at the first rehearsal of Act 11. |
In"Broadway" one finds all the
elements of New York's night life:
the casual, impeccably laundered as
sassin, the ambitious and grotesquely
sentimental "hoofer," the ex prima j
j donna who knows the ropes, the spi-j
dery Greek proprietor, the chorus i
girls, the gun-toting hangers-on. It i
offers a real opportunity for the in- ;
; terpreting of many roles, each out- :
j standing in its own way.
Gilbert Gabriel of the New York j
j Sun wrote about this American play i
I by Philip Dunning and George Abbott J
|in tlie following enthusiastic manner:
| "Nor, for once, can the term "Surefire"
i have the vaguest echo of derision be
hind its hurrahs . .. It is bright, in
tense, painstakingly, good-humoredly
picturesque, it. is alive to every racy
| detail of its setting in the back
I rooms of a city night club, to every
; chance which may twist its plot of j
i hijackers and pistol-toters up to new \
I excitement and new chuckles."
