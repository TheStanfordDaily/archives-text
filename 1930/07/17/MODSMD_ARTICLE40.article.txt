' A revision of the curriculum of the
I University of Wisconsin which will
accommodate the large number of
students who apply for admission,
and yet will maintain the high stand
ards of the institution, was outlined
j by Dr. Carl Russell Fish, who spoke
yesterday at the Education luncheon.
Dr. Fish, visiting professor of history
I during the summer quarter, is chair-
I man of the curriculum committee at
; Wisconsin.
"The committees working on the
problem made forty-one recommenda
tions," said Dr. Fish. "A faculty com
mittee and two student committees
worked from October until March on
the subject. The recommendations are
not to be considered as a final solu
tion." .
Dr. Fish discussed the revision un
der five points, the first; of which was
the provision made for changing the
plan at any time the need may arise.
Diverse Groups Provided For
Under his second point, Dr. Fish
I outlined three recommendations which
will take care of the diverse groups
of students who attend the univer
i sity. Anyone who is qualified may
enter the university and take any
' course lie wanted to so long as he is
not a. candidate for a degree. Such
students are not eligible for member
ship in any fraternity nor will they
be allowed to take part in athletics
or oilier student activities.
The other features of the plan pro
vide for a certificate for those who
complete two years' work at the uni-

I I
varsity but who do not continue in •
school either for scholastic or pecnn- j
iary reasons. All those who receive a
: certificate may. proceed to the junior
year. This plan is expected to elimi
nate approximately one-fourth of
those who expect to go on through
school.
In order to improve the intellectual
attitude of the students a system of
I examinations has been introduced.;
| There are to be attainment tests fori
all tool subjects. Advancement will
! depend upon mastery of a subject
rather than upon a certain number of .
| units taken.
Placement Examinations Used
Placement examinations will be
used to place entering freshmen in
the proper classes. Goal examinations
ion the completion of a student's ma- :
, jor subject will be given in the Ox
ford manner. The examinations will I
|be given on the subject as a whole'
' instead of on artificial divisions. The
purpose is to break down the idea
| that knowledge is divided into distinct
: units.
After much discussion the plan of
j orientation courses was disapproved.
The committee believed that such !
i courses were futile in many cases, i
! However, a course is being developed
which will give a student an approach
Ito problems from tlie point of view
jof pure thought. In this way philo
j sophy will be re-established as an
important part of the curriculum.

' A revision of the curriculum of the
I University of Wisconsin which will
accommodate the large number of
students who apply for admission,
and yet will maintain the high stand
ards of the institution, was outlined
j by Dr. Carl Russell Fish, who spoke
yesterday at the Education luncheon.
Dr. Fish, visiting professor of history
I during the summer quarter, is chair-
I man of the curriculum committee at
; Wisconsin.
"The committees working on the
problem made forty-one recommenda
tions," said Dr. Fish. "A faculty com
mittee and two student committees
worked from October until March on
the subject. The recommendations are
not to be considered as a final solu
tion." .
Dr. Fish discussed the revision un
der five points, the first; of which was
the provision made for changing the
plan at any time the need may arise.
Diverse Groups Provided For
Under his second point, Dr. Fish
I outlined three recommendations which
will take care of the diverse groups
of students who attend the univer
i sity. Anyone who is qualified may
enter the university and take any
' course lie wanted to so long as he is
not a. candidate for a degree. Such
students are not eligible for member
ship in any fraternity nor will they
be allowed to take part in athletics
or oilier student activities.
