"I believe that German Austria will
lu l drawn i 111<j a closer alliance with
Hit; other German states. This will
lie a step in carrying put of Bis
marck's ideas," predicted Ralph Has
well Lutz before an audience in the
Little Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Professor Lutz is a regular member
of the Stanford history department
:iiid chairman of the directors of the
Hoover War Library.
Even under Hie strong and deter
mined leadership of Bismarck the
unity of Germany was not inevitable.
With Ihi! death of the King of Den
mark the whole plan of unification
\v;is changed. The King of Prussia,
the Hundesrat, Austria, and Hie peo
ple, in fact, all but Bismarck, were
in favor of establishing Sclileswig-
Ilolstein as an independent state. Bis
marck opposed this idea and finally
persuaded the King and leaders that
the duchies should be annexed to
Prussia.
Contrary to the belief that it is
easy to start a war, Bismarck found
it very difficult to start a war with
Austria. Finally Bismarck proposed
;i German Diet, elected by manhood
suffrage of all the German people
because he knew that Austria with
her non-German lands would never
consent. The success of the war with
Austria roused The desire of the Ger
niniis to conquer all Europe. Bismarck
with great difficulty prevented this
rash proposal.
France played into (lie hands of
Bismarck when Napoleon demanded
Bavaria as compensation for the
Prussian gains following the war witli
Austria. When Bismarck forwarded
Ihese demands to Bavaria and the
ot her south German states, they
quickly entered a military alliance
with Prussia. "Military unity of Ger
many was completed by 186G, eco
nomic unity a year later, and only
political unity was left to be accom
plished," stated Professor Lutz. When
Bismarck blue penciled the Ems tele
gram making a statement into a chal
lenge, war resulted and German unity
became a fact.
"The empire which Bismarck found
ed is no more. The great work of his
career lias been partly swept away
since tiie revolution," says Professor
Lutz.
