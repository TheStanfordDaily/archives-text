# ARTIFICIAL SUNLIGHT MAKES POSSIBLE NEW PLANT EXPERIMENTS
## 
### 
A "Day Lunii)," which lias just been
| received from the General Electric
J Company, makes possible many
J new experiments on plant growth, uc
! cording to William Austin Cannon,
lecturer in botany. This interesting
scientific device generates in its arti
! flcial sunshne fourteen times as many
j ultra violet rays as does the sun
i itself. The wide range of the powers
iof this light is shown by its effect
upon cotton seedlings, which require
a maximum amount ot' sunlight, and
the willow, which absorbs very little.
These plants opposite needs both
thrive under a ten-hour daily exposure
to this light. An interesting sidelight
of this experiment is that practically
no heat is given off by the globe. This
is shown by the fact that the lamp is
focused on the plants from a distance
of fifty centimeters.
Mr. Cannon is also doing extensive
work in determining the translocation
of oxygen from the sprout of the plant
to its root. He has already worked
this out under the natural sunlight,
and expects to compare the results
with those obtained by using the"Day
Lamp." This work is made possible
by a special grant of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science.
