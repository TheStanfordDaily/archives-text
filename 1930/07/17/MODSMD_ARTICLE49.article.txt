"Culture in the United States of
America" (Kultur in den Vereigniten
Staaten von Amerika) is the title of i
a book written recently by Moritz I
j Julius Bonn, noted German economist,
and visiting professor of economics j
at Stanford. Negotiations for the pub
licution of an English translation of
this book, which is receiving high ac
| claim from critics, are now under way. |
| Edgar Ansel Mowrer, foreign cor- '
I respondent of the Chicago Daily News, j
writes: "The two best recent volumes i
written about the United States are
the late Viscount Bryce's 'American
Commonwealth' and Andre Siegfried's
'America Conies of Age.' Professor (
Bonn's book is in my opinion even |
finer than the other two."
"Culture in the United States of
!America" is divided into seven chap
iters treating the geographical back
ground, the people, the state, the eco
nomic system, the foreign policy, the
changing mentality, and llie signili-;
cance of the United States.
Professor Bonn says in his last ;
Ichapter, "In the United States the!
(way to moderate prosperity and en-j
joyment has been opened to millions, i
All previous men have been ridden !
by a threefold fear: the fear of an ;
avenging god, the fear of a powerful 1
and violent overlord, the fear of bun- i
ger and misery. The American society
is one from which ibis threefold fear
lias been banished."
