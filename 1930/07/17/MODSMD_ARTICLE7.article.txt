# CELLAR MAY BE CLOSED AT NIGHT DECLARES HANDY
## Will Definitely Remain Open Until End of First Term During Evening Shortage of Funds May force Suspension of Business

"The cellar, which is open sixteen i
hours each day, will probably have,
to close during the evenings after
tlie first six weeks of the quarter,"
says Miss Etta Handy, director of t lie
Stanford Union. "This action will lie
taken only when the patronage falls
off to such a poinl that it is no longer
profitable to operate and then with
the sincerest regrets. The summer
quarter students do not utilize the
evening service as much as regular
students."
In spite of the slightly decreased
enrollment tliis summer, Miss Handy j
says there is a gratifying apprei iation !
that the facilities of the Union arc |
an integral part of the Stanford com-!
munity.
The Spanish and French tables have!
been u success this summer and will ;
continue through tho quarter. Each
week the luncheon of members of the '
education department attracts from |
12. r ) to IHO men. The Kiwanis Club re
cently held a meeting in the Union.
On July 23 the Rotary (Mali will
hold a meeting in honor of A. E.
Roth, recently elected president of
Rotary International. The indications
are that all available tickets for this
banquet will be sold in advance, says
Miss Handy.
