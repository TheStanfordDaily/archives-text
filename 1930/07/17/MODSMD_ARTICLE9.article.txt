of Comptroller A. E. Roth.
The Palo Alto city council has au j
thorized an appropriation to help;

mediately laying the conduit for the J
wires before the new road is con- j
st ructed.
The signal, with the new gateway I
to be ejected at the entrance to the |
campus, will not only improve the ap- 1

to make it safer and more convenient I
for the students crossing the high- !
