(j, AM EL -made to smoke
ALL TIIE PLEASURE that tobacco can give is found in Camels!
Mild! Fragrant! Soothing! Refreshing as the dawn of a holiday!
Camels are made for this one reason: To give you the utmost
smoking pleasure. And this can be assured only by the use of
the choicest cigarette tobaccos blended to an inimitable smooth
ness, and prepared by the most modern and scientific methods
of manufacture.
When you light a Camel you have the happy knowledge that
money can't buy a better cigarette.
Don't deny yourself the luxury of Camels
