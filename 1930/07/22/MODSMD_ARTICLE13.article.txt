# SIERRA REDWOODS TO BE VISITED ON NEXT WEEK-END EXCURSION
## 
### 
One of California's famous redwood
groves, the Calaveras Big Trees, will
be visited Saturday on an overnight
week-end trip. The party, conducted
by the Fortune Yellow Cab Company,
will leave the Union at 7:30 a.m. and
return Sunday at t! p.m. The fare',
which is $12, must be deposited two
days in advance at the campus of
fices or at 116 Circle, in Palo Alto.
The Calaveras County Big Trees
of the Sierra Nevada, the "sequoia
gigantea," are both larger and older
than the "sequoia sempervirens," the
ever-living redwoods of the Santa
Cruz coast range. The "sequoia gi
gantea," however, are not commer
cially important. There are not many
of this type in comparison to the
coast redwoods, which quickly per
petuate themselves when scientifically
cut.
The trip Saturday is one of the few
remaining opportunities on these ex
cursions to see some of the natural
beauties of Central California. Only
two more excursions remain, namely:
Uick Observatory, August !Â», and a
drive through the redwoods at Big
Basin, located in the heart of the
Santa Cruz mountains, August Hi.
