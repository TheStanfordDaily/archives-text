# FOUR DOLLARS PLUS A BICYCLE GETS FORD
## 
### 
Trading four dollars and a second
hand bicycle for a Ford was a recent
business transaction of one Stanford
student.
Dismayed by the size of the campus
and the length of time necessary to
go from the University to Palo Alto,
the student bought a bicycle. He soon
found, however, that bicycling was
not an entirely satisfactory means of
transportation. For instance, bicycles
will only accommodate one passenger
with ease.
A clever bit of bargaining resulted
in a most advantageous trade: for the
student now rides to classes and else
where in his own automobile.
