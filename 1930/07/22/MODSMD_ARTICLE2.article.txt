# MILLER. '14, PRESENTS UNIVERSITY WITH SET LOUIS ORR ETCHINGS
## 
### 
From Clifton M. Miller, '14, the Uni
versity lias received a set of etchings
of Stanford scenes by Louis Orr, the
eminent artist, with instructions to
have them framed at his expense for
hanging in an appropriate place.
When it was announced several
months ago that Orr was making these
etchings in his Paris studio, Miller
ordered a set for the University and
the portfolio lie has forwarded con
sists of first impressions.
Louis Orr has made portfolios of
etchings of two or three other Ameri
can universities, but his chief reputa
tion rests on his views of European
cathedrals, among the most famous
being those of Rhcims cathedral un
der fire during the world war. A col
lection of his etchings is displayed in
tiie Louvre in Paris.
President Wilbur, writing of the
Stanford pictures, said: "The Louis
Orr etcliings of Stanford University
please me immensely and repioduce
Stanford in a gratifying way. The
choice of subjects is exceptionally
good. 1 think Hie one of the Stanford
Union and of one of the towers of
the Union are as near perfect as pos
sible in such etchings."
The eight signed etchings in the
portfolio are on sale at $I(H> a set.
Miller is now a partner in the bank
ing firm of White, Weld Â«Si Co., 40
