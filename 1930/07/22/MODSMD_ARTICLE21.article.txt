# HISTORIC COW BELL IS "BORROWED" FROM ROBLE BINGLE TABLE
## 
### 
Holy cow! Page Sherlock
Holmes and Philo Vance. Koble's
cow bell mysteriously disappears
from under the very eyes of the
assembled crowd at the country
fair!
Nevertheless, the situation is
far from ludicrous to the mem
bers of Roble Club. The bell has
been in one family for three
generations. Therefore, as con
siderable sentiment has sur
rounded the object, the theft is
a serious .loss to the owner. The
bell is usually kept safely locked
up only to be brought out on
state occasions. Apparently the
thief, not appreciating the grav
ity of the situation, has unwit
tingly attached the property for
some trivial purpose appropriate
for a cow bell. If such be the
case, the owner would greatly
appreciate its return.
