## Gasoline Thieves Captured After Chase 
### 
After much detective work starting
a week from last night, Fred Frehe,
George Burns, and Gordon Davis, cam
pus officers, succeeded in tracing
down and arresting four boys yester
day for stealing gasoline from cam
pus cars.
The lads were placed in the hands
of Judge Hardy in Palo Alto, who re
leased them to the juvenile authori
ties in San Jose. Judge Brown of that
city cancelled the operator's licenses
of three of the boys, and returned the
fourth, the son of a domestic on the
campus, to the Whittier State School
from which he had been recently
paroled.
The crime was apprehended by a
Stanford student who saw the boys
draining the gasoline from a car in
front of the Alpha Delta Phi house at
midnight. In his own automobile he
chased the two boys who had been
waiting for their companions in their
car to make a get-away to the out
skirts of Ihe golf links. Here the boys
abandoned their car and took to their
feet. The others made their escape
from the Alpha Delta Phi house with
out being detected.
The campus officers have given a
week to pursuing the four boys in this
vicinity. They were tracked down to
their homes in Palo Alto where ar
rests followed.
