# DOWNES SPEAKS ON VARIED PERSONALITY OF COSIMA WAGNER
## 
### 
| "Many liave found fault, quite right,-
j ly, with Wagner's character, and
j more liave found fault, also quite
rightly, with the character of lii.s wife,
Cosima Wagner," said Olin Downes,
music critic of the New York Times,
in his lecture yesterday afternoon at
the Little Theatre. "Cosima Wagner"
was the subject of liis lecture, in
stead of "America's Music of East and
West," which had been previously an
nounced as his subject.
The laughter of LiVizl, sometime
mistress and finally the wife of Ricli
! ard Wagner, closed the Wagnerian
j epoch when she died tin 1 early part,
i of last April at the age of ninety-two.
This curious, enigmatic, dramatic,
woman had all her life been the sub
ject of much condemnation.
Cosima Wagner was married at first
'to a young musician, whom Wagner
had helped to get started on his musi
cal career. At lirst quite distant to
ward her husband's master, Cosima
eventually became as deeply devoted
! tf) him as was her husband.
The mother of Cosima Wagner had
been an aristocrat. Cosima was also
an aristocrat. "Cold, inscrutable, im
perious, she maintained always," says
Downes, "a masterful silence." It is
quite possible that she thought her
husband, who maintained such a
voluminous correspondence that one
I wonders how he had any time to com
j pose operas, slightly verbose and very
I much of a wind-bag. His letters, in
deed, are remarkable mainly for their
mendacity.
Cosima was the lit wife of such a
husband. An excellent critic and an
unscrupulous diplomat, she helped her
husband as no one else could have
helped him. She even hushed up the
j death of her famous father, Liszt, in
ord*r that Wagner's renown might
not, he*even momentarily eclipsed. She
1 stood in back of Wagner, the man,
and in gack of Wagner, the artist.
And she paid the price of being mar
ried to an extremely great, extremely
selfish artist.
