# CAMPUS ACTORS HAVE NEW ROLES IN "BROADWAY"
## Play Is the First American Melodrama Based on Backstage Off-Stage Orchestra Is Used Throughout the Performance 
### 
"In I lie variety of roles in I lie com
ing Stanford production of 'Broad
way,' many actors who are well-known
to campus dramatic performances are
given entirely new types of charac
terizations to work on, and a number
of students who are new to this stage
are given their first opportunity for
local appearance," said Director liar
old llelvenston in an interview for
the Daily yesterday.
"'Broadway' was the first and most
important of a series of American
melodramas based on the backstage,"
he went on. "It treats the backstage,
of a night club. 'Burlesque' treated
the backstage of an average burlesque
company, while 'Excess Baggage,' the
third of this type of native melo
drama, was a play which included
acrobatic performance."
Music Used Throughout
"The play is unique in that music is
used throughout the performance,
both as an active element of the plot,
and as interpolated atmosphere," llel
venston continued. "There is an off
stage orchestra headed by George
Starbird and including Joe Thompson
and Boh Thornton, all of whom are
known not only for their creative
musical ability, but also for their
clever performance.
"In 'Broadway,' Burnell Gould is
given a chance to depart from the
gamut of comic characterizations and
develop a straight, role as the 'hoofer,'
even more typical than that of Leo
Tracy in the eastern production.
"In Catherine Crary's role of Pearl
she is offered an opportunity for a
keen study of youth, contrasting with
her recent character portrayal of Mrs.
Higgins in 'Pygmalion.'
