he wrote a friend: 'after all, I was

men, and that he be a leader of a

in three of these particulars."
Speaking of Wilson's life, Professor
Robinson says: "Horn in moderate
circumstances, but with an unusual
cultural inheritance, he rose to world
ly heights touched hy only half a
dozen men in as many centuries. The
epic quality is there, not only he
cause of the sweep of (lie canvas, but
also because of the tragedy of
thwarted ambition, the fall from a
height seldom attained by man."
Professor Robinson will trace Wil
son's career from his early days
through the four periods in his foreign
policy, in the last of which came the
great tragedy in the life of the states
man. The violent attacks made on
