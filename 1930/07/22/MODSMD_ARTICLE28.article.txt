# WHO WANTS TO STUDY?
## 
### 
fhe testimony of students gathered almost anywhere now i> that the
point in the summer cjnarter has been reached when studying is hardest.
That is, it is harder to study now than it was three weeks ago. The as
signment which in our first enthusiasm was disposed of quickly, now
seems a wearisome burden.
Perhaps this will be the period when be who is possessed with a true
thirst for knowledge will be distinguished from him who is attending
school for less lofty reasons. At any rate, that it is difficult to get into
the right frame ot mind for concentrated work no one will denv. W arm
days and cool nights do little to induce an appetite for writing term pa
pers or poring over reference books.-
Since there is really nothing that can be done about it. there is not
much use in bringing the matter up. Ihe opportunities for swimming,
tennis and golf are still at hand, but whether they are a help or hindrance
in the solution of this problem is a moot point.
