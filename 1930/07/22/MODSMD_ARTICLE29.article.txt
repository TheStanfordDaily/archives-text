### 
With the International I louse at llerkeley nearing completion at
tention is again focussed on this project. Made possible by a gift of
$1,750,000 by John 1). Rockefeller, jr.. it is an effort to harmonize the na
tions of the world. Like the similar house already in use at New York
and those under construction at I'aris and Chicago, its aim is to bring
about a closer fellowship between the native and foreign students at the
great universities, It is hoped that in this way international good-will
will be fostered. I luts the nations of the world will be brought together
as the students of those nations have been.
I he I niversity of California may well be proud that its campus has
been selected as the site fit the west coast international house. I lowever,
Stanford need not cast envious eyes toward this newest of Rockefeller
gifts. For, while Stanford does not boast an international house and one
would probably be undesirable on account of the relatively small enroll
ment, it can boast of numerous successful projects for the promotion of
a spirit of comradeship ariiong students drawn from all parts of the
world. With some eighteen or twenty foreign countries represented on
the campus ( not to mention the "furriu" parts of our own country ) there
is undoubtedly a wide field for such work.
The leader of such work on the campus is the Cosmopolitan Club,
which was organized entirely on student initiative. With no clubhouse
of its own and with no particular backing from others than the students,
it has gone a long way toward encouraging a better understanding among
the diverse nationalities represented. .Millions are a great help in any
enterprise but here we see a good piece of work being accomplishd with
only the youthful spirit of students behind it. After all. it is only that
spirit that can make a success of any project to knit the peoples of the
world closer.
