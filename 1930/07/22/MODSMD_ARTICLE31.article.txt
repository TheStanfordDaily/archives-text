# THE 						ATHEISTS ORGANIZE

### 
A recent issue of the Daily California!! carried the advertisement of
a new club to be called Prometheus, hollowing are a few excerpts from
the ad:
"A club of atheists, under the name of Prometheus, has just been
founded within the student body of the university . . . They believe the
concept of god or divinity to he the simple fruit of ignorance, fear, and
superstition, existing today only through indifference . . . Rejecting any
kind of authority in the field of morals, the members do not recognize
any other guide than reason."
Mere is material for those who have watched "with growing con
cern." the ungodliness of university students. It will make fine copy for
certain newspapers.
While the formation of the club is undoubtedly tangible evidence of
what a group of students think—or maybe think they think—there is
little need to become unduly excited or concerned about it. Why not
let them air their views to each other?
Not merely are they intent on "problems connected with atheism,"
but further along in their ad they declare that they intend "to denounce
all attempts and actions against liberty of 1 bought" and propose as dis
cussion subjects: "Is Freedom of Thought Complete In the American
\ niversity?" and "Compulsory Military Training and the Rights of the
Individual." Possibly somewhat afield from atheism.
The suspicion arises that maybe Prometheus is a group of general
all-round objectors, have chosen the designation of atheists as the most
startling and provocative that conies to hand and are prepared to welcome
martyrdom in the glorious cause of libertv of thought.
Well, there will be plenty of people eager to oppose fliem and thereby
give them this crown of martyrdom. A wiser course would be to rec
ognize that such ebulitions are a natural occasional by-product of en
couraging students to think for themselves. Let them think. Let them
talk.
