College education certainly is a
wonderful thing. Witness the follow
ing conversation overheard in the
Union dining hall the other day:
"Habla Vd. la Espanol?"
"Je ne parle que francais."
"Then get the hell over to the
French table where you belong!"
Sleepy Sam caHed up the office this
afternoon to tell us that he was ill
and wouldn't be in for a week or two.
So far we have been unable to dis
cover the exact cause of his illness.
We know that last Friday he received
a refund on his silly-bus fees but we
have been unable to decide whether
his illness is a result of:
The shock of actually collecting the
money.
The sudden and unexpected wealth
going to his head.
The after-effects of a celebration
with the money received froui a check
that was not "Made Payable to Stan
ford University."
Perhaps "you've noticed the "War
Bulletin Boards" near the Memorial
Court. They look as if they had been
through a war, all right, but Sam
wants to know what war.
They can't be for Ihe Civil War be
cause most of the students know that
that war is over.
Perhaps they are for this war
against ignorance that we hear so
much about.
However, we catf't find anybody
thai knows where that war is taking
place.
So we'll have to give Sam the bene
fit of the doubt.
