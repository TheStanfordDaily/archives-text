# KOHELETH IS JEWISH OMAR KHAYYAM SAYS DR. EDWARD ISRAEL
## 
### 
"A Jewish Omar Khayyam"—thus
| did Dr. Edward Israel of the Jewish
Chautauqua Society, speaking In the
Little Theatre, Friday afternoon, char
acterise Koheleth, the author of the
' Book of Ecclesiastes.
j "lie struck the most astounding
note to be found in any religious liter
lature," said Dr. Israel in referring to
the writer's attitude toward lite. "Af
ter examining the various aspects of
human life, he finds that all is vanity,
a futile striving after the unknowable;
and he concludes by stating that the
intelligent man's position must be
I tliut of philosophical agnosticism."
Dr. Israel introduced his lecture
j with a plea for a better understanding
of the Old Testament.
"It is most unfortunate," he de
clared, "that many people look on the
Obi Testament as a theological text
book. That is exactly whaj it is not.
ilt is a magnificent literature, not of
I one man or one age, but of many ages.
11 reveals the unfolding religious
thought of a people. It has no estab
lished point of view. The smug moral
concepts of the Book "of Proverbs are
to be found alongside the iconoclasm
I of Job and the skepticism of Koheleth,
■Ihe writer of Ecclesiastes."
The Book of Ecclesiastes was not
written by Solomon, according to Dr.
Israel. It was put. Into the mouth of
I Solomon by a later writer because he
wanted to have bis words spoken by
a man who had had the opportunity
to experience life at its fullest. To he
authoritative, the reflections in the
book must come from one who had
j plumbed life to the very depths; Solo
mon was the traditional figure who
represented such experience.
"The theme of the symphony of the
book," he explained, "is 'Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity.' The author
i looks first at nature and sees in it
only a meaningless cycle. Day follows
j day, night follows night; the water
'is gathered up into the heavens only
to he dropped again. 'What is the
meaning of it all,' he asks. 'Is if g£t
t ing us anywhere?' "
In his concluding remarks, Dr. Israel
j explained that the appendant para
graph to the Book of Ecclesiastes was
added by an editor of the work to
make it orthodox. He declared that the
only reason the work was included
among the canonized literature of the
Bible was due to a misinterpretation
of its meaning.
