# FROM ANTIQUES TO ANIMALS HIDDEN AWAY UNDER QUAD

What is below the surface at Stan
ford? Most people know about the
Union Cellar, and, perhaps, the Citi
zenship "reading-room in the basement
of the English building, but not many
have explored the depths of tlie sand
stone and red tile colony which we
know well enough above the surface.
From beneath the bacteriology de
partment in back of the Museum, is
sue barks, squeaks, and other animal
sounds. By investigating, one can find
a hundred mice, thirty-five monkeys,
eighty rabbits, several chickens, .dogs,
and one goat. The monkeys are being
used in connection with experiments
on infantile paralysis serum.
Among the articles found in this
basement is an incinerator in which
remains of this and that from the
anatomy basement next door come to
a fiery end.
Experiment Sation Under Locomotive
The Art Gallery and Museum both
house spare exhibits in their lower
regions, but other "objets d'art" can
be found. The Museum early estab
lished a reputation for having extra
space, but soon the zoology depart
ment had one end filled with fish
specimens, while the psychology de
partment had quartered pigeons in
the other end. The wall between the
fish and the rest of the basement had
to be made fireproof, because of the
risk in the highly inflammable alcohol
preservative.
Under the famous "Governor Stan
ford —Number One" locomotive is Pro
fessor C. P. Stone's experimental sta
tion, where white pigeons are used
for psychological study. A reinforced
floor had to be put in the room where
the locomotive is kept.
Rifle Range Underneath Arcades
The department of engineering has
used the space under the rotunda of
the Museum, and has stored there

i the first deisel engine made. In the |
rest of the basement are exhibits
which have not yet been used, and I
some tilings which have not been re
paired sinte the earthquake in 190(5.
The dust and cobwebs beneath the
Art Gallery revealed some statuary,
' a poster advertising an art sal« in |
1!»18, a cat, and five kittens.
When a Stanford man registers -in
j the Administration building, he usu
ally doesn't realize, that below the
arcade in front of the building is the
rifle range used by the University
Rifle Club. And when he walks from j
Memorial Court to the Physics corner,
on his way to Sequoia or to an after
: noun laboratory, he is generally tin- ;
! aware that beneath the checkerboard
walk is one of the famous spectro- I
scopy laboratories of the United
' States. I
A Tut-ank-amen Tomb
When the Physics Department, in
(192fi, needed more space, they opened 1
a wall and enterd the catacombs under
the arcade in front of the zoology de- j
partment and School of Business Ad- j
ministration. Under Professor G. R.I
Harrison, experiments have been con-!
ducted there concerning the intensity j
of measurement of spectra lines.
Under the stage in the Assembly!
I Itall is a veritable tomb of Tut-ank
amen, containing hieroglyphics which
are sometimes Greek letters, and i
sometimes names of plays and nctors.
Scenery, old properties, and three
flights of stairs which spiral their way j
a few feet into the air, and there stop, 1
are among the relics.
The Library keeps duplicate copies
of books, old newspapers, and private
libraries which have been bought, in
its basement. The Rookstore has a
furnace down below, and, according
to those directly concerned, it fre
quently contains floods during winter
, weather.
