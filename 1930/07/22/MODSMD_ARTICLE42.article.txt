# AIR TRANSPORTATION HERE TO STAY SAYS DURAND IN LECURE
## 
### 
A warning against over-optimism
regarding I lie aeronautical industry
was voiced l»v Dr. W. F. Durand in
a talk on Aeronautical Transportation
before the Commercial Secretaries
School, Friday. Dr. Durand is profes
sor emeritus of mechanical engineer
nig and a member of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
While he was confident that air
transportation lias come to stay, Dr.
Durand looks for no such revolution
in transportation as the automobile
caused because only a very small per
cent of tiie population have the neces
sary combination of physical, mental,
;i ml nervous qualities to pilot planes.
Development in the construction of
planes will, however, improve the con
ditions somewhat.
Dr. Durand also discussed the fac
tors that must foe taken into considera
tion in evaluating air transportation.
The problem which must be solved
wherever air transportation is con
cerned is whether the plane should
carry a heavy "pay-load" and cut down
on t lit) fuel supply, thus necessitating
shorter flights, or to take long flights
with small loads.
"Taking into consideration all the
facts we now know, and only those
that we know," Dr. Durand continued,
"it is possible to place a speed limit
011 planes. With an optimum combina
tion of materials and engine, a plane
can be constructed that will go ap
proximately 400 miles an hour.
"There are elements of safety in
air transportation not normally found
in other methods. Despite the fact
that only a few of tlie total number
of casualties reported in a year are
on regularly established transport or
commercial lines, there is still a cer
tain amount of hesitation in tlie minds
of the public. We are not sufficiently
air-minded," he continued.
In conclusion, he stressed the ne
cessity of limiting the production of
planes to ten or twenty types, rather
than the 100 or more kinds of planes
now on the market.
