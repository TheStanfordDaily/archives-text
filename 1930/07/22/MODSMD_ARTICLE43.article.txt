"1 donated $0.50 to a fund which
was to employ a Chinese detective to
find Stanford's Axe soon after it had
been taken, and at that time I re
solved not to visit the University
until the Axe was returned; so 1 have
n't been back for twenty-five years,"
Merle Thorpe, '00, editor of Nation's
Business, told a large group of friends
at the dinner given in his honor Fri
day night. During his speech he re
lated many humorous incidents of his
undergraduate years at Stanford.
Thorpe arrived on the campus from
(lie plains of Kansas witli only $0 in
It is pockets and a great deal of en
thusiasm. His first job was doing
secretarial work in the library. "My
only experience for this position was
that I had typed a few letters on an
old-fashioned typewriter for my dad,
but aided by a lot of patience on the
part of the librarian I was able to
do (he work," he said.
"Since my bank account was usually
low, I ate rather carefully. I had so
to this day I can't look a grippe nut
to this dap I can't look a grape nut
in I lie eye," he continued.
"Business as conducted today is not
dry," Thorpe went on. It is full of
romance and adventure. Wrigley in
India trying to persuade the natives
to throw away their betel nuts and
use his gum; a big clock manufac
turer trying to send a shipment of
alarm clocks into the Himalaya Moun
tain region; and the rise of an ob
scure bicycle repairman to be the
richest man in the world are all
stories of American business."
Any student can benefit by using
liis extra time studying business men
and conditions of the local industries,
according to the speaker, who con
cluded with (lie following statement:
"Stanford is indeed fortunate in hav
ing a city like Palo Alto as a prac
tical laboratory to supplement and
complement, the theories and ideas
taught in the classrooms."
