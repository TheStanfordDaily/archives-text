# PLAY IS MENTAL ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR OF HYGIENE
## 
### 
"Play is not physical but mental," j
said Clark W. Hetherington, professor
of physical education, to the Daily
yesterday, "as there can be no physi
cal development without mental de
velopment." However, there is a deep ;
prejudice against the word physical
and people do apt realize the import
ance mental development plays in the
make-up of tlie healthy individual.
These prejudices are grouped under
three headings, namely: philosophical,
scholastic, and puritanical. The j
philosophical prejudice is based on I
the distinction of an aesthetic ideal j
which exalts the mind and debases !
the body; the scholasticism prejudice
exalts the intellect and ignores the |
emotions; while the puritanism preju- j
dice is deathly afraid of play and I
would exalt seriousness.
Four Sections to Program
Professor Hetherington outlined the j
program of physical education that |
has been his guide. It is divided into ;
four sections, the first being a pro- j
gram of physical training or big j
muscle activities; the second is a ;
program of character, morals, and
manners; the third, a program in j
teaching hygiene; and fourth, a pro- !
gram in the control of health condi
tions based on health control, protec- !
tion, or supervision which is the gen- ;
eral function of the school and of all j
teachers.
Among the objectives of the pliysi- j

I cal education program that Hethering
ton lias been advocating is the special
I emphasis that is being put on the
values of activities and the great good
that has been done in character edu-
I cation —providing places for play for
the youngster and thus eliminating a
great deal of juvenile delinquency.
Play Activities Beneficial Later
Professor Hetherington graduated
from Stanford in 1895 at which time
Ihe was an assistant instructor in
! charge of Encina gymnasium. That
j was in the days of the great Walter
] Camp, with whom Hetherington was
most closely associated. Camp was
; the one that gave him the idea of
j studying mass athletics. Since then
J lie has done everything to bring into
the schools play free from the strict
discipline of calesthenics which is
i only a development of the big muscles.
Upon being questioned as to the ef
; feet of athletics on the men in later
J life, Professor Hetherington replied
| that the play activities are never a
| hindrance. The later life of tlie ath
lete is not handicapped by previous
j injuries. Nearly every man who has
had an athletic career lias made a
conspicuous place for himself in the
! various fields of endeavor. In college,
i Hetherington was an athlete and a
■ gymnast and is therefore well quali
! fled to speak on the value of athletics
j in later life.
