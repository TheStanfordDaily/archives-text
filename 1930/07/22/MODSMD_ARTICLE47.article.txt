# NOVEL SYSTEM OF MEAT DISTRIBUTION IS DEVELOPED IN N.Y.
## 
### 
The modern housewife may now
purchase meat, neatly wrapped and
labeled, without waiting for the
butcher to cut it, remarked Carl L.
Alsberg, director of the Food Re
search Institute, "who has just re
turned from the East.
Dr. Alsberg explained that (his novel
system of having the meat cut at a
central shipping yard, where it is also
wrapped in transparent parchment,
does away witli the necessity of an
expert butcher in (lie retail grocery
or butcher shop. In this way the meat
is not touched after it leaves the
packing house.
"This was the most interesting
phase of my investigations," he said
"The new system has just gotten a
start in the New York chain stores,
and its spread will depend upon its
success in that state."
While in the East, Dr. Alsberg visited
New York, Washington, and Baltimore
where lie was engaged in statistical
research on the use of fats and oils
in food products. When 'in Washing
ton he visited Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur,
president of Stanford and Secretary
of the Interior.
