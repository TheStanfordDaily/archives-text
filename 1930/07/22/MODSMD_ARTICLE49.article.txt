# TREMENDOUS OVATION GIVEN RODZINSKI AT SYMPHONY CONCERT
## 
### 
Dr. Artur Rodzinski, guest conduc
tor for the fourth symphony concert
at the Woodland Theatre, received a
tremendous ovation at the end of Sun
day's program. Although only thirty
seven years Did he has already be
come famous for his musical achieve
ments in Europe and as conductor of
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orches
tra.
Opening the program Sunday with
Tscliaikowsky's Symphony No. 4 in
F Minor, Rodzinski showed excellent
musical interpretation throughout the
entire composition which was written
to represent fates as the tragic power
that prevents the yearning for happi
ness from reaching its goal. Although
the symphony begins tragically it
ends in a mood of philosophic optim
ism, interpreting the thought that
there is still happiness to be gained
by rejoicing in the joy of others.
The second part of the program be
gan with the Toccata and Fugue in
1) Minor by Bach, This was followed
by two nocturnes, "Clouds" and "Fes
tivals" by Debussy. "Clouds" repre
sents the unchangeable appearance of
the sky, with the slow and solemn
march of clouds dissolving in a gray
agony tinted with white. The second
nocturne is a highly abstract repre
sentation of the festival of the uni
versal rhythm of all things.
This number was followed by the
Liszt symphonic poem, "Les Pre
ludes." The score of this work is
prefaced by a reference to the Medita
tions Poetiques of Lamartine who
terms life as a series of preludes to
an unknown song. "Tales from the
Vienna Woods," Strauss' well-known
waltz, concluded Sunday's program.
The concert next Sunday will also
be under the direction of Rodzinski.
It will include: Overture to "Per
Freischutz" by Weber, Symphony No.
1 in (' Minor by Brahms, two compo
sitions by Ravel including symphonic
fragments from the ballet "Daphnis
et. Chloe" and Series No. 2: Daybreak,
Pantomime, and Dance. The program
will end with the famous "Spanish
Caprice" of Rimsky-Korsakoff. This
will be Rodzinski's last appearance
with the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra this season.
