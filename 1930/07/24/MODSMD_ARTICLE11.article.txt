# HARRISON TO GO TO M.I.T. FOR RESEARCH SPECTROSCOPY WORK
## 
### 
Professor George Russell Harrison |
jof the physics department yesterday
received official notice of bis appoint
i ment to the faculty of the Massachu
| setts Institute of Technology, where
|lie will do research work in spectro
l scopy. Two of the research assistants ■
i of the physics department., Walter E.I
1 Albertson and Donald B. Weaver, are |
going to the Boston institution with
' him.
Professor Harrison graduated lromj
j Stanford in 1919, when Professor Fer- !
i nando Sanl'ord was head of the de
j partment. The next year lie got his
M.A. and in 1 !>22 he received his Ph.D.
!ln 11)24 he went to Harvard on a!
national research fellowship, and re- ;
turned here as an assistant profes- i
sor. Later, in 1925, he became an as- i
sociale professor.
Professor Harrison's particular j
branch of spectroscopy is Hie intens-|
ity measurement of spectra Hues. Hisi
j "spec lab" is considered one of the |
best in the world by physicists. It
was built in 192(i, and contains ina
| terial which is Unusually good for his
line of work. The laboratory equip
' ment which he has used here is being
sold to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology by Stanford.
The new laboratory at M. I. T. is
i being built for both physics and chem
istry, with a separate spectroscopy
laboratory. Professor Harrison in
tends to go to Europe next spring,
where he will visit the European
1 physics laboratories.
Professor Karl T. Compton, head
Jof the physics department at Prince-
I ton University, was named this year
as the next president of M. I. T., and
will fill that position beginning this
year. Professor Compton appointed
I Professor John C. Slater head of the
physics department. Professor Slater
goes to M. I. T. from Harvard. He was
i)ti the summer faculty at Stanford
! in 15<2t», and is a theoretical physicist.
Professor Harrison intends to leave
Stanford for the East on the (lrst of
September.
