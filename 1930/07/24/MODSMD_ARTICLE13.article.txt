## 
### 
Cnliiiness and flexibility marked the
performance of Marcus Gordon in his
piano recital last night, in ltohle. lie
played with sin ease and musical un
derstanding far beyond his twenty
one years.
Although his playing lacked clear
ness in a few instances lie played
with a sincere depth of feeling and
his tone possessed a lyric quality
which is distinctly his own.
Gordon presented two of the most
difficult piano compositions from the
standpoint of both interpretation and
technique. These were the Variations
and Fugue of Brahms on a theme of
Handel, and the Chopin Fantasy in
F Minor. Throughout the entire pro
gram Gordon showed a competent
mastery of his subject.
Other selections presented were:

i Adagio in B Minor by Mozart, Inter-
I mezzo in 15 Flat Minor by Brahms,
and Caprissloso in C Sharp Minor by
| Brahms. Gordon concluded his recital
with three compositions of Chopin,
namely, Ktude in C Sharp Minor, Fan-
I tasy Impromptu, and Polonaise.
Although Gordon did not seem to
[ he entirely tit ease in announcing his
numbers, lie gained poise as soon as
I he began to play. This fact seemed to
i bear out his own statement that he
j thoroughly enjoyed his playing. His
; program, varied in character, was well
I received by a capacity audience.
At the reception which followed the
| recital Gordon proved to be an enter
; taining conversationalist. He re
| marked that Koble was an especially
, pleasant place in which to present a
i recital.
