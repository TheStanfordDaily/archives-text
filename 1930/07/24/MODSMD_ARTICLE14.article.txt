# ALMON E. ROTH, PRESIDENT OF ROTARY INTERNATIONAL, IS HONORED AT BANQUET
## Spirit of Friendliness Is Overcoming International Difficulties Of Language, Religion, and Custom Working For Fellowship and Co-operation 
### 
rpllE spirit of friendliness lias overcome the obstacles to the formation of a
world organization, said Almon E. (Al) Roth, president of Rotary Interna
tional, to his home town Rotarians and friends at. a banquet in his honor in
the Stanford Union last night.
It is this spirit of friendliness that has counteracted the difficulties of
language, religion, and custom, he said, until today 350(1 clubs with 152,000
members are scattered over the world.
"1 attribute my election to two tilings," said Rotli, "first my connection
with a university which is known the world over, and second to the entliu-

siasm of this district which comprises
California, Nevada, and Hawaii."
The San Francisco Rotary Club was
the second one organized, to be
quickly followed by others in this
state. An attendance of 92 per cent
last year demonstrates the enthusiasm
that gets things done.
Dr. Swain Speaks
J)r. Ilohert E. Swain, acting presi
dent of the University, pointed out
the features of the convention that
impressed him. In the last 25 years
[the power of Rotary has been de
veloping. The early years were con
; fined to local development but inter
ests liavf?grown to international pro
portions. The convention selected a
man who was capable of carrying on
this international spirit. "No one can
lead us better than Mr. Roth," said
Swain.
John L. McNab, orating as only
Demosthenes could, was the other
speaker at the. banquet presided over
by William (Bill) Owens.
Musical Program Given
An exceptionally fine program of
music was presented under the direc
tion of Warren Allen. Charles Bulotti
sang "I Hear You Calling Me" in
Italian and English and "Thanks Be
to God." Assisted by the Morris Club
of Palo Alto, Bulotti sang an "Italian
Salad." The Morris Club and a quartet
from the Exchange Club of San Jose
sang "Swing Along."
Dr. Swain told how Al Roth was
raised in Mendocino county, the only
county that can boast of a town that
has turned out five Stanford track
captains. Roth, beside being one of
these captains, played football on the
American Rugby team that went to
Australia, was one-sixth of the fire
department famous for its sprinting
abilities, student-body president, mem
ber of the executive committee, and
the man who laid the foundations for
deanships.
