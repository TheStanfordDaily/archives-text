rpllE spirit of friendliness lias overcome the obstacles to the formation of a
world organization, said Almon E. (Al) Roth, president of Rotary Interna
tional, to his home town Rotarians and friends at. a banquet in his honor in

language, religion, and custom, he said, until today 350(1 clubs with 152,000
members are scattered over the world.
