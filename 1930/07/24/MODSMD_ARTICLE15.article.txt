## 
### 
Dr. Alonzo R. Taylor of (he Food
j Research Institute will return tonight
! from Fresno, where he has been in
connection with his work as a mem
ber of the Federal Farm Board com
mittee which is (-becking up on the
acreage in grape production signed
up for co-operative control.
Prospects that the campaign for
( control of 85 per cent of the Stale's
â–  grape acreage would succeed were
encouraging yesterday, according to
| Fresno dispatches. Only 10,00(1 acres
were needed to make a total of 441,000
acres required for federal aid. Suc
cess will mean a loan of $20,000,000
from the government to finance the
crop, which is reported one of
the heaviest on record.
Fresno stores wore closed Tuesday
' to give their employees a chance to
help sign up grape-growers who had
not as yet made contracts.
Dr. Taylor returned recently from
( research work in Minneapolis, where
he was when his appointment to the
Farm Board committee was an
! nounced.
