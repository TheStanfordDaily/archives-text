# BILL FOR PATENTING NEW PLANTS SIGNED
## 
### 
It is now possible to patent new
plants as well as other things newly
discovered.
A bill was recently signed by Presi
dent Hoover making it possible to
patent any new and absolutely origi
nal plant. An excerpt from the bill
reads something like this: "any per
son who has discovered any new use
ful art, machine, manufacture, or com
position of matter, or any new or
useful improvement thereof, or who
has invented or discovered and sexu
ally reproduced any distinct or new
variety of plant other than a tuber
propagated plant, not known or used
by others in this country before his
invention or discovery thereof, arid
not patented or described in any
printed publication in this or any for
eign country."
The bill also authorizes the Secre
tary of Agriculture to commit to the
Commissioner of Patents, the powers
to make necessary research to permit
this new piece of legislation to func
tion properly. Preparation for the
executing of such a law necessitates
the recording of practically all the
plants now in existence. Many of
these are not recorded officially now.
Obviously, an enormous task con
fronts the Commissioner of Patents.
