1 he National Academy of Sciences will hold its annual meeting this
year on the campuses of ( ali-lornia colleges. Kor the first time in its
history this organization of eminent scholars in science will convene west
of the Mississippi.
The Pacific Coast is no longer on the outskirts of the country either
physically or culturally. We are contributing and participating members
of a great society, no longer on the fringe of the nation's scholarly
affairs, but as much in the heart of them as anv other part of the nation.
I his was not always so; the change has been very recent â€”since the
time of Stanford's founding. At that time the I Cast raised its eyebrows
when it was polite concerning the proposed establishment of another
university in this untutored district or frankly ribald when it spoke its
mind freely. There was as much need for another university in Cali
fornia. said one newspaper in Xew York, as for an asylum for decayed
sea captains in Switzerland.
I hey were wrong; the founders of Stanford were justified. The
three institutions which will be hosts of the National Academy rank
equally with the best in the land. California keeps them crowded with
students. Those students become leaders in scholarship. They are taken
into membership in the National Academy; they are called to the faculties
of the older Eastern institutions. The Academy meets in California, not
as a polite gesture to a state with worthy ambitions, as would have been
the case a few years ago, but as a perfectly natural and normal thing.
