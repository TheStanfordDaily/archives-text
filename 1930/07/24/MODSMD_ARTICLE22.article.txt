# CHANCE FOR HUMAN CONTACTS
## 
### 
The Education banquet tomorrow night should he a big affair. Ac
cording to the I'awlout approximately four hundred students are regis
tered in the Department of Kducation. Alanv others registered in other
departments are taking courses in education.
The banquet will provide an opportunity for faculty members and
students to meet in a relationship different from that of the classroom.
A banquet table is an excellent place to get acquainted with people and
make friendships. Perhaps the professor who seems a humorless dis
penser of bald facts in the classroom will be revealed as a genial soul.
And vice versa the professor may discover that those in his classes are
not the stolid sluggards thev sometimes appear to he. but real personali
ties.
The affair should be a sell-out.
