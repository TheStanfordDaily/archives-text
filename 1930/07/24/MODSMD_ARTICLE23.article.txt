# INVIDIOUS COMPARISONS
## 
### 
Fashions 7n horrible examples change. Now it is one thing and now
another that is held up to public opprobrium as a terrible warning of
what bad little boys come to or what municipal mismanagement produces
or what misguided political leaders will accomplish. And whatever the
special bugaboo of the moment, it is all but universally accepted.
()nce unruly children were tamed by merely having a few selections
from (irimms' fairy tales read to them. The black hand has been used
to save wear and tear on the family hairbrush. Nowadays the bootlegger
and the gangster have taken the place, of the Maftia as a corrective in
fluence and hits from the daily newspaper contain more horror than the
most lurid tales about dragons and witches.
And the classroom is not immune to this popular tendency to compare
and set up warnings. There are some overworked horrible examples,
however, that lack justification in ;i place where balanced judgment and
considered speech should prevail. To use as illustrations of sure retribu
tion for misdeeds places and persons only partly known, if actually
known at all, by both professor and students, is stretching the proprieties,
to say the least.
To cite Chicago as the terrible den of iniquity and overlook the
( hicago of the wonderful growth and beauty is somewhat unfair. To
speak of Arkansas as the state of poor schools and fail to consider that
the person making the comparison is taking the two worst counties as
typical is an injustice to that state. The roads of Mississippi may be bad
but a trip through a couple of counties does not make one an authoritv
on the subject. In a student body as cosmopolitan as that of Stanford
there is nearly always someone iu every class who knows more about the
horrible example than the one who is making the comparison. Let the
winds of freedom blow but there is no need to have them blow over
ash heaps and garbage dumps. It is well to be aware that the backward
state of Tennessee had miniature golf courses more than a year before
the progressive state of California!
