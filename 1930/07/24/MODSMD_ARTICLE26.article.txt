# RODZINSKI TO MAKE LAST APPEARANCE IN WOODLAND THEATRE
## 
### 
Dr. Artur Rodzinski, whose first ap
pearance in central California drew
a capacity audience in the Woodland
Theatre concert, will conduct for the
last time at Hillsborough Sunday af
ternoon.
The San Francisco Symphony Orch
estra will present a varied program
of classic and modern selections. Dr.
Rodzinski demonstrated last Sunday
his complete familiarity with the
musical expression of several schools
and periods. His program this week
will again give the young musician
ample opportunity to show bis versa
tility as a conductor.
The overture to the opera "Der
Freischut" by Weber, a favorite open
ing selection for orchestral programs,
will be the first number. The brilliant
piece of orchestral writing, Rimsky-
Korsakoff's "Spanish Caprice," which
Tschaikowsky called "a colossal mas
terpiece of instrumentation," will con
clude (lie program.
Another work by Rimsky-Korsakoff,
whose "Bolero" was given its Pacific
Coast premiere a few weeks ago, will
have its first hearing at these con
certs. This number will be the series
No. 2 of the Symphonic Fragments,
arranged by the composer from the
ballet, "Daplinis et Chloe" which Ravel
wrote in 1911.
Brahms' Symphony No. 1 in C Minor
will be played Sunday. It shows an
interesting contrast to the Brahms
Fourth Symphony, which was pre
sented at the second concert under
the direction of Molinari.
The concerts on August third and
tenth will be conducted by Willem
Van Hoogstraten, guest conductor
from the Portland Symphony Orches
tra, and the final concert will be un
der the direction of E. Fernandez'
Arbos from Spain who has been con
ductor of the Madrid Symphony Orch
estra for twenty-five years.
