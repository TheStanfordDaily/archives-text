## 
### 
Many interesting autographed
copies of modern publications and re- I
productions of old manuscripts are j
to be seen among a new collection of '
books which is now on display in the
show cases in the main corridor of (
the Library.
A large number of these books have
been donated by Albert M. Bender, i
who is a leader in the Book Club of
San Francisco. Many literary enter
prises, such as the collection of poems j
by California writers into an anthol
ogy and a program for the promotion j
of fine arts in San Francisco have
been the work of Bender. He has 1
done one of his most notable services |
in assembling a collection of books !
for Stanford University.
Among the books on display is one !
which is dedicated to Bender. It, is !
"Goodness Walks Attended" by Cecil
and James Johnson. Other books in
clude an autographed edition of "The |
Man Who Missed The Bus," by Stella i
Benson; "A Mad World My Master"
by Nicholas Breton, and a descriptive
catalogue of the Goewey Collection
of Browning Pictures.
Reproductions of original manu- j
scripts included are a photostat fac- |
simile from a copy in the Henry E. [
Huntington Library, "A Larume Belle 1
for London" with a "caueat" or warn- I
iiitf to England, published in 1573; tlie |

published in 1593 and republished in ,
19i!8; "The Book of Thel" by William j
Blake; and various poetic collections !

and the Spanish poet, Jos6 Marti.
In regard to photostat facsimile re

that they are constantly becoming
more in demand when exact repro
ductions are necessary for university!

librarian. Already many copies of
famous literary works from the Hunt
