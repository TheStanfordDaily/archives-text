# NEW PLANT OCCUPIED BY STANFORD PRESS; SECRIST BOOK ISSUED
## 
### 
The Stanford University Press has
moved this week into its new quar
ters in the Press Building, the car
penters having given up their pos
session of the last three months. The
lower floor is given over to offices,
with room in the hack to provide for
the storage of books. These offices,
together with the new shop building
finished last December, will complete
the equipment of the Press.
The general business office occu
pies more than a third of the floor
space, and in addition there is a
series of five private offices for the
various officials. The office-stock stor
age room and a large direct-mail rocyn
fills the remaining space.
The second floor has been carried
back over these offices, doubling the
available space. This space will he
occupied by the Division of Journal
ism and the various publications.
The move into these new quarters
will be marked by the publication of
several important books by the Press.
Among the major titles scheduled for
appearance between September and
March are: "The International City of
Tangiers," by Graham H. Stuart;
"Imagism and the Imagists," by Glen
Hughes; "John Charles Fremont: An
Explanation of His Career," by Cardi
nal Goodwin; "The Paradox of the
Ludicrous," by S. S. Seward, and other
books of equal significance.
"Banking Ratios," written by Hor
ace Secrist and issued as No. 1 of the
Claremont Colleges Business Studies,
lias just been published by the Press.
