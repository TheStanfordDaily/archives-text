# TOURISTS DECREASING SAYS STUDENT GUIDE

### 
"Is that the Museum?" asks a tour
ist, pointing at the Memorial Church.
"How much did it cost?" asks an
other. buying a dozen post-cards to
send home.
Such is the life of a student guide
in front of Memorial Court. Accord
ing to .James Walker, the salesman
of pictures and other souvenirs and
the oracle for innumerable families
from lowa, the Questions come thick
and fast, although the tourist crop
is decreasing.
"Not so many ask for the Hoover
home as did a year ago." said Walker.
Fewer tourists are coming these days,
according to the guide, who added
that tho number diminished soon
after tho stock market crash last au
tumn.
Post-cards sell better than anything
else. Nearly every tourist pauses in
front of the table where the pictures
are displayed, and if-lie doesn't buy
anything, he always asks questions.
Giving of information is the main
purpose in having the student guides.
