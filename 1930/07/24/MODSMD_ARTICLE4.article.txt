# ROBINSON LAUDS WILSON IN TALK
## Lecturer Believes President Affected All Americans 
### 
I "Wilson was a Jeffersonian a cen
j tury late. There is hardly a person in
! the second decade that was not af
! fected by the fact that he was presi
j dent," said Professor Edgar E. Robin
son in his lecture in the Little Thea
tre yesterday afternoon on Wood row
Wilson.
This man who vitally affected the
American people and whose influence
reached across the sea was born in
Virginia just prior to the Civil War
and grew up in the South during the
trying years of reconstruction.
"He did his work effectively and
showed the characteristics that were
to make him president: independence,
clarity of thought, and efficiency in
execution," said Professor Robinson.
"Never before had a man of such
training as Wilson entered the
White House. Domestic reforms that
he accomplished in eighteen months
j were enough to make him a great
I man."
In his foreign dealings Wilson set
| a new standard, according to Pro-
I lessor Robinson. In his international
I relations he asked for justice and fair
| dealings in actuality. It was Wilson,
j single-handed, t hat kept the United
States out of Mexico.
Wilson's actions in the great war
can be divided into four periods. Dur
ing the first he observed strict neu
trality. In the second he negotiated
with the warring countries attempt
ing to stop seizures by England and
| murders by Germany. The third was
! one of war participation in which
I Wilson carried us into war not for
national reasons but for an interna
tional program, the prevention of fu
ture wars. Lastly, in peace, Wilson at-
I tempted "a realization of his peace
time as well as his war-time policy,"
said Professor Robinson. "In the last
efforts he lost the support of his na
tion and was drawn into the compro
mises of Europe.
"The source of Wilson's power can
be found in his mind; his courage,
which was not limited by expediency;
and his virtue, which lie found in the
j mass of men. But his aloofness, the
' gap that existed between the real
things and his plans, and the fact
that he was too often in the realm of
general ideas were weaknesses that
were obvious to his critics. These
critics, harsh or boasting to the ex-
I treme, agree that Wilson was greatâ€”
I for good or evil."
