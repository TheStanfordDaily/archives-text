# U.S. EXPERIMENT STATION PRODUCES PLUMP PEACHES
## 
### 
Apricots as large as baseballs are
j being grown on the Stanford campus.
! Ripe, evenly colored apricots meas
: uring seven and three-quarters of an
I incji in circumference are produced
ion the orchard which the United
| States Department of Agriculture
! maintains near the old home of Dr.
! David Starr Jordan.
Experimental work on a number of
trees, including those bearing apri
j cots, peaches, plums, pears, and
| prunes, is being carried on for the
i purpose of producing fruit of extraor-
I dinary size, excellent flavor, and even
j color, which will can well, dry proper
i ly, or sell fresh on the open market.
W. F. Wight, Stanford '!)!>, director
! of the research, is also developing a
j group of trees which will thrive in
j the same locality, and bear a uniform
1 quality fruit, with the end in view of
(extending the ripening period of the
j orchard from two weeks in length to
I five. Wight believes that this will tend
i to stabilize marketing conditions.
The experimenting is carried oil
j along practical lines as well as scien
| tific. Each tree is sampled for Truit to
I be dried, canned, and served fresh.
I The results from this work are re
corded as shrinkage during drying,

| color after drying, color after can
ning, and flavor after the various
' treatments. These records are studied
j and a weakness in one species is
overcome by the cross-pollination with
'one which is strong in that way. The
result is that they have large, un
blemished fruit with even color and
fine flavor. Wight has accomplished
I several remarkable things: lie has de
creased the drying shrinkage by
twenty-five per cent, he has evened
the color of the canning peaches and
; apricots, and he has stopped the pits
I from cracking while still inside of
; the fruit.
I The orchard is of considerable size,
j covering about twenty acres and hav
| lng 2500 different species of trees on
it. In number, the peach trees pre
dominate, but there are also over two
I hundred different varieties of apri
; cots as well as numerous cherry
trees, prune trees, plum trees, and
1 pear trees.
Wight co-operates with the Canners*
League of California, the Dried Fruit
Association of California, and several

I several remarkable things: lie has de
creased the drying shrinkage by
twenty-five per cent, he has evened
the color of the canning peaches and
; apricots, and he has stopped the pits
I from cracking while still inside of
; the fruit.
I The orchard is of considerable size,
j covering about twenty acres and hav
| lng 2500 different species of trees on
it. In number, the peach trees pre
dominate, but there are also over two
I hundred different varieties of apri
; cots as well as numerous cherry
trees, prune trees, plum trees, and
1 pear trees.
Wight co-operates with the Canners*
League of California, the Dried Fruit
Association of California, and several
prominent growers in the State, to im
prove the growing and treating of
j fruit in California. He announces that
i no bud-wood is ready for distribution.
Apricots as large as baseballs are
j being grown on the Stanford campus.
! Ripe, evenly colored apricots meas
: uring seven and three-quarters of an
I incji in circumference are produced
ion the orchard which the United
| States Department of Agriculture
! maintains near the old home of Dr.
! David Starr Jordan.
Experimental work on a number of
trees, including those bearing apri
j cots, peaches, plums, pears, and
| prunes, is being carried on for the
i purpose of producing fruit of extraor-
I dinary size, excellent flavor, and even
j color, which will can well, dry proper
i ly, or sell fresh on the open market.
W. F. Wight, Stanford '!)!>, director
! of the research, is also developing a
j group of trees which will thrive in
j the same locality, and bear a uniform
1 quality fruit, with the end in view of
(extending the ripening period of the
j orchard from two weeks in length to
I five. Wight believes that this will tend
i to stabilize marketing conditions.
The experimenting is carried oil
j along practical lines as well as scien
| tific. Each tree is sampled for Truit to
I be dried, canned, and served fresh.
I The results from this work are re
corded as shrinkage during drying,

| color after drying, color after can
ning, and flavor after the various
' treatments. These records are studied
j and a weakness in one species is
overcome by the cross-pollination with
'one which is strong in that way. The
result is that they have large, un
blemished fruit with even color and
fine flavor. Wight has accomplished
