# SECOND ROUND IN HANDBALL MATCHES NEARLY COMPLETED
## 
### 
Second-round handball matches
have been played with the favorites
coming through as expected. All but
I one of the first-round matches have
been played and play will enter the
third bracket, beginning next week.
The winning team of the doubles
handball tournament for the summer
quarter will receive two white slip-on
sweaters that some anonymous sports
man lias donated.
The results of the play so far in
clude the defeat of Clapp-Osburn by
I Downy Hamlyn; Huibbard-Byrd by
| Schall-Slocumb, 21-5, 21-13; and Wil
son-Skaff defeated Johnson-Kaar, 21-0,
21-1.
Contests to be played next week
include Brudshaw-Harris vs. Schall-
Slocumb; Dillon-Harder vs. Wilson-
Skal'f; Ilobesky-Maloney vs. Downy-
Hamlyn; and Freeman-Trombetta vs.
Dilly-Barker. As none of the favorites
are pitted against each other, there
is no possibility of upsets one way or
j the other. The teams of Maloney-llo
besky and Bradshaw-Harris continue
to rule the roost and in all probability
j will not meet until the finals.
