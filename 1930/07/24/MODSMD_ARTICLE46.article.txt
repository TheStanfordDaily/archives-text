# ELIZABETHAN STAGE NOT BARE AND PLAIN DECLARES PARROTT

"Only in recent years has the self
evident fact that llie Elizabethan dra
matists wrote their plays for a theater
of a different type from modern ones
, been taken into consideration," de
clared l)r. Thomas Marc Parrott in
Ibis lecture on "The Elizabethan Thea
' ter" in the Little Theatre, Tuesday
night. Dr. Parrott is visiting professor
| of English from Princeton University.
"There is a tendency among certain
critics," he said, "to find fault with
Shakespeare's technique, evidently be
cause his plays don't fit the tndoern
stage. Naturally, if Shakespeare wrote
today his technique would be differ
ent."
Elaborate Properties L)3ed
Professor Parrott upset some popu
lar beliefs by explaining the findings
of modern research. Contrary to tra
dition the stage of the Elizabethan
theater was not so rare as textbooks
would have us believe." Elaborate
properties were often used, such as
chariots, fountains, wells, trees strong
enough to support lovers who climbed
up to their sweethearts' bowers, and
such.
"The stage was hung with arras,"
j he continued, "and sometimes painted
I cloths something like modern scenic
i curtains were used. A comparatively
j enormous amount was spent for cos
j tunics, which often were of silk and
i satin trimmed with gold and silver

lace. Quite complex stage scenery 'was
used. For Instance, in 'Cymbeline'
Jove descends from heaven, throws
thunderbolts, and makes a speech.
This must have called for an elabo
rate mechanism."
Three Stages Used
Dr. Parrott explained t'hat the Eliza
bethan theater was divided into three
parts, an outer stage covered by a
wooden porch-like structure called a
shadow, the alcove, and the balcony.
An arras separated the outer stage
from the alcove which could be set
with properties. Above the alcove was
the balcony which was also curtained
off. The balcony was used to repre
sent such scenes as walls, battle

ments, balconies, etc,
"My using all three stages, action
could bt> madi to flow swiftly without
any halt," he said. "Such a stage gave
the dramatist much freedom and llie.v
thought of their plays as a continuous
whole.
