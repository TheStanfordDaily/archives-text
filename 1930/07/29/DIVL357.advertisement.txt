FROM THE DAY the choice leaves of sun-mellowed Turkish and
Domestic tobaccos are first selected for Camel Cigarettes, every
step in their manufacture is headed toward just one goal—the
making of a thoroughly enjoyable smoke.
Pleasure, found at its best in Camels, is the only reason for smok
ing. That's why Camels make no pretense (if being anything but a
smoke. Camel is a blend of exquisite smoothness, mild and mellow
and marvelously fragrant. Have a Camel!
