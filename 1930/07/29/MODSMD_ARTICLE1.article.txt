# EUROPE DIVIDED IN OPINION OF U.S., SAYS BONN
## One Group Expects America To Reform World; Other Sees tins Country as Menace Noted German Economist And Author to Develop Theme in Lecture Tonight 
### 
"Wliat Does Europe Expect from
America?" is the subject, of tlie lec
ture which will he given at S o'clock
tonight in the Little Theatre by Pro
lessor Moritz J. Bonn, noted German
economist.
The different attitudes taken to
ward the United States will first lie
discussed. "These attitudes vary
greatly," says Professor Bonn, "hut
they swing between two poles. One
group looks to the United States to
reform miraculously the entire Euro
pean system; the other considers
American influence as the greatest
danger which the Old World has to
face.
Two Economic Groups
"The economic split in Europe is
much the same as that in the United
States. Again there are two groups,
one favoring the permanent economic
participation of tlie United States in
European affairs, and the other which
is frightened by the very thought of
such a condition. Participation or non
participation is not the real question,
but. is only a secondary tiling.
"The future of social justice and
economic progress the world over will
depend largely on the use the United
States makes of its own system. As
tiie present 'great country,' it sets an
example to the rest of the world. Eco
nomic success of all class interests in
this country will extend a challenge to
the rest of the world and give it a
chance to profit from the example
shown."

Professor Bonn has, for the past
ten years, been much concerned with
the reparations problem. Part of the
