"La France au Lendemain des
guerres Napoleoniennes" will be the
subject of the first of a series of
three lectures to be given in French
by Professor Marcel Moraud. This
lecture will be given at 4:15 tomor
row afternoon in the Little Theatre.
Professor Moraud plans to sketch
France as it. was seen from foreign
eyes after the restoration of the Bour
bons.
During the Napoleonic period and
tor a time before it,"says Professor
Moraud, "France was looked upon by
tlie rest of Europe with hatred. Con
sequently, social, political, and espe
cially literary France was the object
of much unfavorable propaganda. Af
ter the resumption of relations be
tween France and England in ISI4,
many people visited Paris; for the
first time in twenty years a true pic
ture of France was seen by the rest
of the world.
"Literary France was discovered by
Europe after the Napoleonic wars in
the same manner that, literary Amer
ica has been uncovered since the
World War. The periods compare fa
vorably. The foreign point of view
after the Napoleonic era was particu
j larly interesting in that many unusual
! angles on literary France were
| brought forth."
Professor Moraud, who is head of
the Department of Romance Lan
guages at Rice Institute, has spent
much time doing research work on
foreign sketches of France during the
restoration period from 1814 to 1836.
