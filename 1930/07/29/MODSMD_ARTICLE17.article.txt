"Broadway," a fast-moving melo
drama of New York life, will l)e pre
sented in the Assembly Hall at B:.*><l
o'clock Friday evening. This is the
second play of the summer quarter
dramatic season to be presented un
der the direction of Harold Helven
ston.
"Broadway" is a vivid play of the
main street of New York around the
l!i28, in which a killing is thought, no
more of than in the days of Machia
velli, where it is not considered wrong
to resort to lawlessness.
In this drawing of New York night,
life one is afforded an insight into the
foibles and fancies of the backstage,
at times humorous and at times tragic,
where a heart is broken in one mo
ment and mended in the next. The
varnacular of the play is typical and
the humor is zestful. It is not only
the type of language one expects to
find in New York, it. is the kind one
really hears.
There is not a dull moment in the
play; the entire action is keyed to
| a tempo of excitement, surprise, and
j laughter.
The life and loves of a, cabaret
singer will be portrayed by Nellie
IVlay Chapman in the role of Billie
Moore. The ambitions and trials of
an average cabaret "hoofer" with the
efforts he goes through to attain suc
cess will be played by Burnell Gould.
The part of Steve Crandall, the law
less leader of the Broadway bootleg
ring, which is enacted by Terrence
Geddis, probably requires the most
definite change in characterization
throughout the play. In the great tri
angle situation of the play these three
create the chief love interest.
The other love plot of the melo
drama presents two characters so well
drawn that one wishes their appear
ance together were longer. Catherine
Crary will portray the role of Pearl,
the tragic chorus girl, and Harry l<ee
Logan will play opposite her as "Scar"
j Edwards.
