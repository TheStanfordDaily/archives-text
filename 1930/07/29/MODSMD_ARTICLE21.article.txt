'111 is is a free ad for I'lie American Mercury, a Monthly Review i
edited by 11. L. .M encken. August number, supplementing the large j
number of post cards sent out by the enterprising circulation manager, |
notifying" Stanford people that they simply must buv that issue and
read "The Success lloys at Stanford."
"1 he Success Hoys piece is the lirst in the magazine. It was written i
bv a man who needs nobody to tell him how to become a success hoy!
with the American Mercury. Smoothly and brightly it sneers at Stanford |
and its founders, the three presidents of the I niversit v, Jordan. Brainier,!
and Wilbur, three members of the board of trustees bv name, the only!
two members of the teaching stall it mentions bv name. And I'resident
Hoover. C'hielly Hoover ami W ilbur.
It points out Haws in every single thing it deals with and finds good;
nowhere. As an example o! that kind of journalism it would serve as aj
perfect model for the school of journalism if the school taught that kind, i
What you do to attain an article on such a subject that will be sue-j
cesstul with the Mercury editor is to handle the truth, if inescapable, so j
that it infers something unpraiseworthy, you retell old. disproven tales. 1
saying they are not credited by all. von skitter along just oil the border |
of downright libel, you write everything with the "slant" that you,
thought out to give the article the Mercury "tone," you make little heaps
of nasty inferences and inuendos, put pretty llowfcrs of nifty words on'
them and snicker like an over-clever little boy up to his tricks. It's great 1
fun, provided you are so constituted that you can enjov that kind of
amusement. Presumably it pays in coin of the republic.
You must read this article. Hut don't take it 100 seriously. Xobodv
else will.
Somehow, we gather from this issue that the American Mcrcury
doesn t care for I'resident Hoover, and the success boys in the Mercnrv
have found it out. I here are twenty pieces of one sort or another in j
ihe mfu'n body of the magazine, including the page of biographical notes'
on contributors, and in live of these Hoover is referred to in uncompli-j
mentary manner, lulitor Mencken does verv well in this direction him-1
self. He signs two departments: editorials and book reviews. Of his!
three editorials, the first is wholly a diatribe against Hoover; the second
takes merely a fling at him in the course of demonstrating that a large
number of other men held in high esteem are really Hops, lie has three
book reviews and manages to drag in disparaging remarks about I Joovcr
in two.
Xo, The American Mercury, edited by I I. T,. Mencken, doesn't really!
like President Hoover. Perhaps that is just as well.
