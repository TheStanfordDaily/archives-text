Recently the Daij.y told of work on tlic campus for the promotion of
better international relations. Now the activity of Stanford students is
never limited to the campus and it was natural that they should soon
extend their work farther afield. The year V) 2() saw the birth of an idea
at Stanford that soon attracted the interest of many students. One in
particular, Karbara Dewlaney, '27, caught the spirit of the idea and set
about iu an enthusiastic manner to bring it to fruition. Largelv as a
result of her tireless efforts, but with the aid of many other students, the
first annual conference of ihe Student Institute of Pacific Relations was
held in the fall of 192(>.
Annual meetings have been held since then, first at Montezuma Moun
tain School and then at Lokoya Lodge. Xapa. Thev have been a great
success from the very start and have gone a long way toward accom
plishing their avowed purpose. Stanford may be proud that her students
were in a large measure responsible for the. original organization of the
Institute and its subsequent success. Xot all the problems of race rela
