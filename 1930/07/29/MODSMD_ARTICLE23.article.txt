# TRAINING FOR LEADERSHIP
## 
### 
One of the more popular courses in the Kducation department lliis
summer, judging from the number enrolled, is th'c one dealing with
student activities in the high school. More than seventy five experienced
or potential educators will spend four days each week throughout the
quarter studying ways and means of handling the large number of activi
ties which are separate from the regular classroom work and which
occupy a large amount of students' and teachers' time.
Instead of being grudgingly allowed a place in school life outside of
regular school hours, such things as athletics, dramatics, debating, clubs,
school publications, and mam more are actually welcomed by the pro
gressive principal and given a place in the school day. I bis is a good
index to the change that has taken place in education in a comparatively
few years.
One of the reasons for this development is that pedagogues have
realized that a very valuable kind of training can be given in these
activities. Training in the elusive values of leadership, co-operation, and
in all those qualities which make one a good citizen are learned by
students under conditions which closely resemble actual living. They
learn bv doing.
Ideals can be apprehended mentally out of textbooks or from lectures.
Rut the actual transformation of these ideals into correct attitudes and
habits comes only through actual experience. A student may be able to
state all the qualities which go to make up a leader. 1 iitil he has actually
tried to lead a group, until he can demonstrate that he possesses the
qualities of a leader bis knowledge is of little value. The same can be said
of the important virtue of co-operation. I.vlia classroom activities pro
\ ide tltat sort of training.
