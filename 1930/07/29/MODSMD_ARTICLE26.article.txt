# RODZINSKI RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM AT SYMPHONY PROGRAM
## 
### 
Conducting his last concert of the !
| season in the Woodland Theatre, Suu
i dyy, Dr. Artur Rodzinski. young con- |
Iductor from the Los Angeles Philhar-j
i monic Orchestra, was received with |
tremendous enthusiasm.
The overture to Weber's opera,
"Der Freischutz," was the opening j
selection on the program. Under ltod
jzinaki's baton ihe rendition became'
[indeed a triumphant, march, still re-!
taining, however, the lyric quality of I
| a song. Following the overture was
i the sonorous Symphony in C minor j
by Brahms whose difficult movements
| were performed with surprising clear-I
| ness and dexterity.
Departing from German influence
i the second half of the program opened
| with the second set of symphonic i
| fragments from the ballet music to
"Uaphnis et Chloe" by the French !
I composer, Ravel. The brilliance of
Rodzinski's presentation of this tium- j
j ber was particularly in keeping with
j its virtuoso style of composition.
Concluding the program was Rim
-1 sky-Korsakoff's "Spanish Caprice," a
'composition suggesting an exotic kind
lof gypsy splendor. Throughout this
number a contrast between the string
and wind sections of the orchestra
was especially prominent.
Rodzinski showed excellent con- !
j ducting ability in each of the varied
j types of music on Sunday's program,
jHe also showed a remarkable ma- j
turity in musical understanding.
The concert next Sunday will be
directed l>y Willem Van lloogstraten
I from the Portland Symphony Orches
! tra.
