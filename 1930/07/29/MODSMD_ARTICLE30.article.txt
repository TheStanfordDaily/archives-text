# FOOL PROOF ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT INSTALLED
## 
### 
Electrical Engineering students will j
be able to play around next, fall with
4000 volts of electricity and still be i
perfectly safe. All this is because the i
new electrical equipment being in
stalled in the laboratory is practically
"fool-proof."
One of the improvements found in I
the new machinery which lessens lhe
danger of accidents wits explained by
F. R. Stowe, foreman of the installing
job. This is the installation of cut
offs which interlock with the oil
switches so that the switch cannot be
closed when it should be open.
Anther "fool-proof" scheme was
originated by James W. McDonnell,
assistant superintendent of buildings
and grounds. He suggested that the
meters which control the 4000 volts be
inclosed in an iron cabinet outside !
the building. The main door of the |
cabinet can be unlocked only after
an auxiliary door has been opened
which automatically turns off the cur
rent.
The installation, according to
Stowe, has been going on for about
a month. It will be completed by
October 1, when the last of the para
phernalia arrives.
