# BIBLE NOT OUTGROWN SAYS DR. BROWN IN SERMON LAST SUNDAY
## 
### 
"We have not outgrown the Bible;"
declared the Reverend Charlefc R.
Brown, dean of Yale Divinity School, i
in his sermon, Sunday, in the Me
morial Church. This was the fourth !
of his series of live sermons here, i
Next Sunday lie will preach on tilt
"Present Challenge to Religion."
According to Dr. Brown, we have
outgrown the belief that every word
of the Bible is to be taken as in- j
fallible. He mentioned the two dif
fering accounts of the Creation, tht
varying accounts of the Flood, and
the three stories of the Ten Command
ments. That there are such inconsis

tencies, lie said, does not show that
the whole tiling faulty, hut merely
points out that the Bible is the result
of growth and development. On this
subject of literal interpretation of the
Scriptures, lie said that "telling the
truth would have saved many a stu
dent who couldn't square bis class
room knowledge with what he had
been taught in Sunday School."
In answer to the feeling of some
modern writers that the Hible is a
"buck number" and was written more
for an ancient people than for us, Dr.
Brown replies:' 'We don't outgrow
Hamlet and .Macbeth, or Beethoven;
no more do we outgrow the record of
the religious experience of the peo
ple."
