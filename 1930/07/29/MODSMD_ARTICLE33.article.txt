at college," said Dr. Ellwood P. Cub
berle.v, Dean of the School of Educa
tion, speaking at the Education ban
quet, Friday evening, 011 "Changing
(Conditions."

realize that college is a serious propo
sition," lie saifl. "A plan such as is
being tried out at Wisconsin where
many are tried out in the first two
years and many sent home before the
junior year may be the solution."
Another possibility outlined by Dr.
Cubberley was that the universities
will become professional schools. All

Hie first two years, entering a uni
versity only if they intend to go into
a profession.
Deploring t lie loss of training in
leadership in large schools, he pre
sented ;i plan for developing it. Small
colleges of perhaps 150 students, with
an instructor for every six or eight
students would give intensive train
ing and develop qualities of leader
ship. The difficulties of such a plan,
lie asserted, were lack of money, lack
of professors of vision, and lack of
adequate libraries and laboratories.
