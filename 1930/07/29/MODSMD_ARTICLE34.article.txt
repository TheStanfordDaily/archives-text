# "BACH STANDS LIKE A MOUNTAIN PEAK" SAYS OLIN DOWNES
## 
### 
"In no period of music have we
gotten out of the shadow or beyond
the reach of the master, Bach, who
stands like a mountain peak on a
landscape," said Olin Downes, music
critic of the "New York Times," in
his lecture yesterday afternoon at (he
Little Theatre on "The Period from
Bach to Beethoven."
"It is not the technique, but the ex
pression of music that we care about,"
said Downes. "Much harm lias been
done to music and music lovers by the
so-called high priests of the art. Music
is not written for professional
aesthetes but for the common people,
and really great music is akin to the
thoughts and feelings of (lie common
people and to the processes of nature."
Dowries spent part of the time
showing (he primary devices of com
position, and illustrated many of them
on the piano. He analyzed various
types of compositions, from (lie sim
ple folk song, "My Love's an Arbutus,"
to the magnificent and splendid
"Fugue in 1) Minor" hv Johann Sebas
tian Bach.
"The folk song," said Downes," is
a song of i lie people, simple and beau
tiful, which expresses (lie tthings
they understand in the manner that
they understand it. It is more radical
than individual, and from it all the
unessential and insignificant details
have dropped away. Later, as intelli
gence progresses, men crave .more
(hail (lie folk song. The beautv and
haunting tenderness is exchanged for
(he more subtle variations of elabo
rate compositions.
"Music is characterized by its de
pendence uopn a structural idea, and
by its unity, variety, symmetry, built
upon the principle of imitation and
contrast. Great master that Bach was,
however, he was not concerned with
technical problems. He could ignore
Ihem."
