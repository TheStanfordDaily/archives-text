# STUDENTS SPEED LESS IN SUMMER DAVIS BELIEVES
## 
### 
"Summer students are more careful j
I drivers and do less speeding t lip 11 the
regular summer students," states
Campus Traffic Officer Gordon Davis.
"Since the summer students are usn- ;
ally older, they realize that speeding
is an expensive thrill, while the regu
lar student body is made up of a lot of
; young fellows who never had to earn i
a dollar of their own. When they feel
the urge to step on the gas they do 1
so with the idea that dad's allowance
is enough to cover amusements. A
fine does, not mean much to them."
The official speed limit 011 the cam
pus is twenty miles per hour hut i
Davis feels that thirty miles is con
servative speed and anyone is safe
doing this on the straight drives if
he slows down to fifteen miles at in
| tersections.
"The fastest car 1 ever had to stop
was going sixty-eight," says Davis. [
He was not a student, however, so he
•as tried before the city court. One '
' student received a ticket for doing
j fifty-eight on the Palm Drive.
"They offer me all kinds of excuses.
The most common one is that they i
1 are hurrying to a class. The best one
1 ever heard was when I stopped a j
car and asked the occupants their ;
reason for such great hurry. They re
plied that they had rushed down from 1

the city to take a picture of the Me- i
niorial Church as tJie sun was just \
right for :i good view. The excuse ;
was so ridiculous I let them go."
Girls are as bad as the boys for
speeding, Davis believes, yet a warn
ing usually causes the girls to slow
down while the boys soon forget. Con
trary to general opinion a legitimate
excuse lias saved many a ticket from
being written.
"More people are fined for violating
the parking rule during the summer
than all the rest of the year," says '
Davis. "The older students may be
past the reckless driving age, but tbey
fa il to realize where they leave their
cars. 1 find them parked on the walks,
across put lis, in front of 'no parking'
signs, and have had to tag a- couple (
of cars parked too near the same tire !
plug at tlie same time.
"The most common offense is fail- ;
ure of students to place their registra
tion cards or pink slips in a conspicu
ous place on their automobiles as re
quired by law. Failure to do this '
means a fine of $1 when detected."
Ha vis believes tlie student body is '
made up of the finest bunch of fellows
he has ever dealt with, l'or during his |
live months of service here he has j
never had trouble with any of them, i

"More people are fined for violating
the parking rule during the summer
than all the rest of the year," says '
Davis. "The older students may be
past the reckless driving age, but tbey
fa il to realize where they leave their
cars. 1 find them parked on the walks,
across put lis, in front of 'no parking'
signs, and have had to tag a- couple (
of cars parked too near the same tire !
plug at tlie same time.
"The most common offense is fail- ;
ure of students to place their registra
tion cards or pink slips in a conspicu
ous place on their automobiles as re
quired by law. Failure to do this '
means a fine of $1 when detected."

"Summer students are more careful j
I drivers and do less speeding t lip 11 the
regular summer students," states
Campus Traffic Officer Gordon Davis.
"Since the summer students are usn- ;
ally older, they realize that speeding
is an expensive thrill, while the regu
lar student body is made up of a lot of
; young fellows who never had to earn i
a dollar of their own. When they feel
the urge to step on the gas they do 1
so with the idea that dad's allowance
is enough to cover amusements. A
fine does, not mean much to them."
The official speed limit 011 the cam
pus is twenty miles per hour hut i
Davis feels that thirty miles is con
servative speed and anyone is safe
doing this on the straight drives if
he slows down to fifteen miles at in
| tersections.
"The fastest car 1 ever had to stop
was going sixty-eight," says Davis. [
He was not a student, however, so he

' student received a ticket for doing
j fifty-eight on the Palm Drive.
"They offer me all kinds of excuses.
The most common one is that they i
1 are hurrying to a class. The best one
1 ever heard was when I stopped a j
car and asked the occupants their ;
reason for such great hurry. They re
plied that they had rushed down from 1

the city to take a picture of the Me- i
niorial Church as tJie sun was just \
