# LA 						MAIN LESTE WELL PRESENTED
## 
### 
"La Main Leste," a one-act comedy,
was presented in French by members
of the French Table last evening in
the Little Theatre before an apprecia
tive audience. The clever play by E.
Labiche and Edward Martin was un
der the direction of Joseph Donnav.
The cast, which was entirely com
posed of American students, gave a
very accurate and pleasing perform
ance. Mine. Legrainard, the irate
mother, was ably portrayed by Eva
Boyle. Richard Waterhouse gave a
good characterization of her husband,
M. Legrainard.
Catherine Musante gave an out
standing performance of the sweet
and charming Celine Legrainard. With
real artistry Elmer Atwood depicted
an ardent young painter, showing
real experience in his work. Charlotte
Howard gave an effective picture of
the vaporous Mine, de Pontmele.
She evidenced natural qualities for
dramatic interpretation in her short
role.
Preceding the play, Catherine Mu
sante sang two solos in French, with
excellent technique and feeling. Un
der the direction of Mile. Adele Jap
lade two French folk songs were sung
in chorus by Catherine Musante,
Charlotte Howard, Eva Dovle, Marian
Wilson, Katherine Shirley, Helen
Thomas, and Miles. Penney and
Madariaga.
Joseph Donnav gave a series of reci
tations, and followed these humorous
poems with an old popular French
song, to which the audience repeated
the refrain in chorus.
