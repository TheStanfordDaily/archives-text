# DR. E.H. REISNER OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SPEAKS ON EDUCATION
## 
### 
"Knowledge of the techniques of
education has far outrun knowledge
of the ends of education. We know
pretty well how to handle the great
numbers we have to teach, but we
don't know much about ultimate di
rection," declared Dr. Edward H. Reis
ner in a lecture Thursday morning
before a group in Education. Dr. Reis
ner, head of the Department of His
tory of Education at Teachers Col
lege, Columbia University, is visiting
professor at the University of Cali
fornia.
Dr. Reisner's subject was: "The
Hitsis of a Philosophy of Education."
Outlining the difference between the
educational philosophy of the latter
part of the 19th century and today,
he s.iid that educators must redefine
in terms of modern educational philo
sophy the meaning of the terms, "per
sonality," "socialization," and "demo
cracy."
"In the '90's practically all of the
educational psychologies assumed the
existence of a soul," he said. "We
lived in a theistic universe in which
every one could find his place. It
was a cozy world. We knew why we
were here, how we should act, and
we had a fairly clear idea of where
we were going. But in a relatively
short time that has been changed to
such an extent that one never sees
the terms 'soul' or 'God' in modern
psychologies or philosophies of educa
tion. in the shift to the modern view
the individual has lost his sureness of
his place in the world. Educators
must rediscover and retrace these ul
timate relationships."
Dr. Reisner's conclusion was to the
effect that whether we started with
a belief in God and worked down to
man. or whether we began at the bot
tom. say with man's lowest instincts,
and worked up, we would probably get
the same set of values. He empha
sized the point, however, that the
problem had to be thought through
and not left to chance.
There is a legend, Dr. lteisner said,
"that Ellwood P. Cubberley is not a
person but a corporation; a syndicate
that hires men to write books."
While on the campus Dr. Reisner
was a guest at tlie home of Dr. and
Mrs. Cubberley.
