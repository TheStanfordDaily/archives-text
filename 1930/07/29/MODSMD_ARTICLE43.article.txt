# DICTAPHONE AIDS STUDENTS TO CORRECT FAULTY SPEECH
## 
### 
i Errr . . . Err . . . aa . . . These
t | and other inane sounds frequently j
t I make an otherwise good speech sound j
3 | terrible. "Students permit themselves !
- J to acquire such habits because they
- do not hear themselves speak objec- j
•, j lively," states Miss Elizabeth Buck- j
- ingham, associate professor of Eng
j lisli (Public Speaking) in an interview
- j with a reporter of the Daily. "To over- ;
; j come this difficulty the public speak- j
- | ing classes have been using the dicta- j
I phone in a variety of Ways."
■ | The dictaphone is a commercial I
| machine that records spoken words i
' j and reproduces them at any later !
' i time. In reading poetry tlie dictaphone
. ! demonstrates to the student whether J
' j or not he is reading with the right '
• time, or with the right tone, or if I
■ any words are peculiarly pronounced.
Helps in Dialogue
Extemporaneous speakers who are
over-pugnacious or too mild soon find 1
it out when they hear the speech re
peated by a dictaphone. A good many i
1 students have been surprised to hear
themselves use long involved sen
tences connected together with "ands," ,
or to hear some word repeated a
1 j number of times'.
In dramatics, short scenes are re
' hearsed before the dictaphone until
the dialogue is built up to the correct
I dramatic climax.
| "You do not recognize your own
. | voice when a dictaphone reproduces t

. it, although the voices of all the other !
i members of the class are readily ■
j identifled," said Miss Buckingham. '
i "This indicates that you probably do
; not hear your own voice."
In the near future the department i
j of public speaking hopes to acquire a
i new and much-improved machine, the
telegraphone, which will enable them
j to make permanent records of speak- j
j ing. The study of the phonetics of i
I different geographical locations has I
i been possible in a limited way with ,
j the dictaphone. This study would as
j sume much greater importance if 1
t more adequate equipment were avail- i
! able.
Used in Dialect Study
Professor Ayres of Columbia is mak
ing a study and record of all the dia- j
lects in the United States. In dra
matics the records of all kinds of
dialect would be of inestimable value
in enabling actors to correctly inter
pret characters. "Imagine what a reve- .
lation it would he to hi l able to hear
the spoken words of the Chaucer's
'or Shaskespeare's time," ways .Miss t
Buckingham.
Miss Buckingham believes that any- I
one could give himself a very good ,
course in public speaking by studying !
Ihe theory from a book and practic- j
ing before a dictaphone. Examination
would be easy; merely save an early ;
record, then repeat the same material :
i later and compare the two records.

Used in Dialect Study
Professor Ayres of Columbia is mak
ing a study and record of all the dia- j
lects in the United States. In dra
matics the records of all kinds of
dialect would be of inestimable value
in enabling actors to correctly inter
pret characters. "Imagine what a reve- .

Miss Buckingham believes that any- I
one could give himself a very good ,
course in public speaking by studying !
Ihe theory from a book and practic- j
ing before a dictaphone. Examination
would be easy; merely save an early ;
record, then repeat the same material :
i later and compare the two records.

Helps in Dialogue
Extemporaneous speakers who are
over-pugnacious or too mild soon find 1
it out when they hear the speech re
peated by a dictaphone. A good many i
1 students have been surprised to hear
themselves use long involved sen
tences connected together with "ands," ,
or to hear some word repeated a
1 j number of times'.
In dramatics, short scenes are re
' hearsed before the dictaphone until
the dialogue is built up to the correct
I dramatic climax.
