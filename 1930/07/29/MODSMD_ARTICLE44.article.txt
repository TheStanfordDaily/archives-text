## 
### 
Normal human beings, when they
| have wandered through the Egyptian
room of the Museum and turn to the
left at the northeast end, start per
ceptibly and frequently display other
signs of shock.
Meeting a full-sized locomotive face
to face in a I'niversity building is
startling, even if the locomotive was
used in the sixties and is valuable
only as a museum piece.
The "Governor Stanford" is the
first passenger locomotive which was
purchased for the Central Pacific
Railroad. It was made in Philadelphia
about 18G0, and was sent to California
by boat around Cape Horn. When it
arrived in California, it was hauled
to Sacramento, put together there,
decorated with a blazing numhir "1"
and the name "Governor Stanford"
in big white letters 011 its ultra-mod
ern black engine. Thus arrayed, the

""Governor Stanford" sallied forth,
early in 1564, to blaze a new trail j
I between Sacramento and poinis lOast. |
After the number "1" had spent
jits youth on the Central Pacific run, |
| it was used around the train yards, |
and finally was sent down to the I'ni- I
| versity. After several years in a shed
'here, it was installed in the Museum. |
The "Governor Stanford" now (
dwells in a round room, the wall of,
i which was broken down to allow its
I entrance. The floor beneath it is rein
' forced, to prevent the arrival of a
j locomotive in the basement below.
! Aroumlg the campus heirloom are j
j relies of early American Indian life,!
land in the balcony above are pseci- j
mens of lace and patch-work quilts, j
Beneath it are pigeons for psycholo- j
j gical study; around it are skeletons
: and wampum; and in it is â€¢ dust, al- j
j most obscuring its name and number. |
