# ABNORMALITY SAID TO BE DEVIATIONS FROM NORMAL BY BRIDGES
## 
### 
| "Abnormal psychology is simply
deviation fmm the central tendency
I of the group, such as a super mem
ory. The abnormal is also a deviation
I from yourself; for example, when a
i customarily calm person becomes
angry," said Dr. J. W. Bridges, in his
lecture Saturday morning on "What
Is Abnormal Psychology."
Another definition states that ab
i normal psychology is a deviation from
! the standard or ideal. The first, or
I statistical definition, is preferred, be
j cause deviations from the normal
[ curve can readily be seen.
i The statistical definition given by
Dr. Bridges has certain implications:
[first, that abnormal includes the sub
| normal, supernormal, and paranormal.
In memory, sub and super are respec
tively below and above the central
tendency, while the paranormal per
[ son remembers something else than
that which really happened. Second,
'abnormal must not be associated with
the pathological (disease) concept,
j Abnormality may or may not be the
j result of disease. "Many of us are
; abnormal, but not pathologically ab
i normal," he said. "Some abnormali
i ties are desirable."
Abnormal psychology is a pure sci
ence. a study of major deviations, and
should not be confused with psycho
{ pathology, psychiatry, mental hygiene,
medical psychology, clinical psychol
! ogy, or psycho-analysis.
Dr. Bridges, who is professor of
psychology at McGill University, and
j author of a number of books and
articles on abnormal psychology, ad
mits that most psychologists who
have attempted to write on abnormal
psychology have let other facts than
I fhe pure science of abnormalities af-
I feet their writings. He said this could
; be avoided if the writer would use his
outline.
Dr. Bridges believes that in the
I study of medicine, abnormal psychol
ogy should be taught as a basic sci
; ence rather than a clinical science,
i and should follow the basic sciences
| of anatomy and psychology.
