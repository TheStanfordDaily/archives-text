### 
A. JO. Hotli, comptroller of the Uni
versity, and JO. C. Thoits, representing

I lie board of county supervisors in
Sun Jose, Monday, in an effort to se
cure financial aid from the county to
help defray the expense of the in
stallation of a system of traffic sig
nals at the intersection of University
avenue and El Camino Real.
The entire cost of the lights is es
timated to he about $1500, according
to A. V. Youens, city electrician. Both
the city and the University feel sure
that the county will see the value of
the signals and will contribute its
share of the expenses. The city has
already laid conduits to carry the
electric wiring.
Several different types of signals
were considered l>efore the selection
of one made by the General Electric
Company. As indicated by the draw
ings at the City Hall four separate
lights will constitute the signal, one
on each side of Palm Drive and the
other two on the corners where the
Shell and Standard filling stations are
located. The lights will be of three
colors: green, red, and amber. Dur
ing ordinary traffic the lights will be
automatically controlled, but in case
of heavy traffic at football games and
on special occasions they are to be
equipped so that they can be handled
by a traffic officer located on the
Shell corner.
Amber colored lights will be placed
about 150 feet from the main lights
on the two roads so that the motorist
will be warned of the signal. This
precaution, with tlie widening of the
main highway and the entrance to
Palm Drive will make traffic conges
tion negligible at this intersection, it
is hoped by authorities.
