# MORAUD DISCUSSES RELATION OF FRENCH WRITING TO ENGLISH
## 
### 
The first of a series of three lec
jlures in French on the literary rela-
I tions between France and England
jat the close of the Napoleonic wars
| was given in the Little Theatre yes*
I terday by Professor Marcel Moraud.
The lecture, which was introductory
j to (he next two discussions that will
ideal with the literature of the post
i Napoleonic period, gave a picture of
| France as recorded by visitors in
various journals, notes, and letters.
I "These sketches of France, taken
| separately," said Professor Mouraud,
J "give a very narrow view of French
I life. Collectively, however, the foreign
views give a complete and accurate
picture of the times. They illustrate
I current opinions in France on the
| Bourbons, Napoleon, and the allies.
"Even after the return of the Bour
bons, France was republican at heart,
lit was only the apathy of Hie people
J which allowed them to exist. Due to
| the restless feeling running through
France, the rest of Europe looked
| upon this country as dangerous. From
j the free and brilliant life in Paris,
j which was the natural result of this
| instability, the idea arose that Paris
was an immoral city."
Professor Moraud's next lecture,
j which will be given at 4:15 next Wed
nesday in the Little Theatre, will deal
j with the literature arising with the
I restoration of the Bourbons.
