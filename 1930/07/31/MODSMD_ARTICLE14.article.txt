# VARIED CHARACTERIZATIONS FEATURED IN "BROADWAY" TO BE GIVEN TOMORROW
## Melodrama of New York Night Life To Be Presented in Assembly Hall Keeps Up Rapid-Fire Tempo In Dialogue and Action 
### 
"'Broadway' is going to be one of the most unusual plays ever produced
on this campus from the standpoint of varied characterizations," said Harold
Helvenston, in speaking of the melodrama which is to be given in the
Assembly ilull tomorrow evening at 8:30. "Almost every person in the cast
lias had the opportunity of developing an entirely new role —in many cases
their work is inspired. I have never worked on a play," he went on, "wilh
a more rapid-fire tempo all the way through. This applies to every element
in the production, dialogue, music, and action."
One of the most amusing characterizations in "Broadway" is that of "Lil,"
portrayed by Ethel Livingston. "Lil" is an ex-primadonna who is one

Vof tlie chief performers in Hie Para
idi.se Night Club in New York, in the
j back rooms of which the play is laid.
, She knows all the angles on the in
side of Broadway life and is a real
I trouper through and through.
The plot of "Broadway" is con
cerned with the ruthlessness of Steve
Crandall, head of the bootleg ring and
played by Terrenee Geddis, in carry
; ing out all of his intentions; the
cleverness of the "hoofer," enacted
by Burnell Gould, in thwarting him;
'the dilemna of Billie, tlie ingenue
chorus girl who is portrayed by Nellie
May Chapman, arising from the prob
j lent of knowing whom she really
i loves; the tragedy of Catherine Crary
in Hie emotional role of Pearl; and
j the results thereof.
Typical of Night Life
The choruses of the night clulj, in
cluding Billie and Pearl, represent
every element of tlie stage and are
typical of one side of the life on New
York's main street. Maizie, the hard
| boiled chorus girl, is played hy Helen
Thompson. Ruby will be portrayed by
j Carolyn Hall. Constance Morse will
enact Grace and Elgie Ogier, Ann.
The gangster followers of Steve are
men such as one would find in Chi
cago, "gentlemen" from the stock
yards, in these parts are Vernon
Cordry, Tom Pike, Herbert Jones, A 1
Miller, Glen Lindahl, and Ben Kagan.
Connected with the night club itself
there are Nick Verdis, the Greek pro
prietor, played by Jack Jago and Eri
Richardson in the part of Joe, the
Italian waiter. Gaillard Fryer enacts
l the role of Dan McCorn, the kindly
bill skillful head of the New York
homocide squad. Harry Bee Logan
will have the role of "Scar" Edwards.
Endorsed by Wolcott
"Broadway" is a play in which
J there are all the elements of humor,
pathos, and excitement. In reviewing
| the melodrama in the New York
World, Alexander Wolcott wrote: "It
is a relief and a satisfaction to be
able to report that at las ta complete
ly and heartily entertaining play has
come to town. I cannot for the life
of me think of the man or woman
i who would not be absorbed and deeply
amused by the piece called 'Broad
way.' "
The box office will open at 7 o'clock
j the evening of the production, and
tickets can Ik; bought today and to
morrow in the A.S.S.U. offices in the
i Old Union and at Dodson's in Palo
i Alto.

"Broadway" is a play in which
J there are all the elements of humor,
pathos, and excitement. In reviewing
| the melodrama in the New York
World, Alexander Wolcott wrote: "It
is a relief and a satisfaction to be
able to report that at las ta complete
ly and heartily entertaining play has
come to town. I cannot for the life
of me think of the man or woman
i who would not be absorbed and deeply
amused by the piece called 'Broad
way.' "
The box office will open at 7 o'clock
j the evening of the production, and
tickets can Ik; bought today and to
morrow in the A.S.S.U. offices in the
i Old Union and at Dodson's in Palo
i Alto.
"'Broadway' is going to be one of the most unusual plays ever produced
on this campus from the standpoint of varied characterizations," said Harold
Helvenston, in speaking of the melodrama which is to be given in the
Assembly ilull tomorrow evening at 8:30. "Almost every person in the cast
lias had the opportunity of developing an entirely new role —in many cases
their work is inspired. I have never worked on a play," he went on, "wilh
a more rapid-fire tempo all the way through. This applies to every element
in the production, dialogue, music, and action."
One of the most amusing characterizations in "Broadway" is that of "Lil,"
portrayed by Ethel Livingston. "Lil" is an ex-primadonna who is one

Vof tlie chief performers in Hie Para
idi.se Night Club in New York, in the
j back rooms of which the play is laid.
, She knows all the angles on the in
side of Broadway life and is a real
I trouper through and through.
The plot of "Broadway" is con
cerned with the ruthlessness of Steve
Crandall, head of the bootleg ring and
played by Terrenee Geddis, in carry
; ing out all of his intentions; the
cleverness of the "hoofer," enacted
by Burnell Gould, in thwarting him;
'the dilemna of Billie, tlie ingenue
chorus girl who is portrayed by Nellie
May Chapman, arising from the prob
j lent of knowing whom she really
i loves; the tragedy of Catherine Crary
in Hie emotional role of Pearl; and
j the results thereof.
Typical of Night Life
The choruses of the night clulj, in
cluding Billie and Pearl, represent
every element of tlie stage and are
typical of one side of the life on New
York's main street. Maizie, the hard
| boiled chorus girl, is played hy Helen
Thompson. Ruby will be portrayed by
j Carolyn Hall. Constance Morse will
enact Grace and Elgie Ogier, Ann.
The gangster followers of Steve are
men such as one would find in Chi
