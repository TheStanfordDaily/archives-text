"The main theme of the National
Survey of Secondary Education in
California is the vertical articulation
of pupils and the way it is effected
by the district organization," said Dr.
William M. Proctor, chairman of the
California survey and speaker at the
Education luncheon yesterday noon.
"By vertical articulation is meant
the movement, of pupils from one
type of school to another," (.he speaker
explained. The district organization
here and in other states has seriously
restricted articulation and the crea
tion of schools like the junior high
school which would improve this arti
culation.
The National Survey is investigat
ing three major problems: first,
schools and district organizations
(the California project); second,
school population, ils retention, elimi
nation, and personnel; and third, ad
ministration and supervision.
To accomplish the California pro
ject three counties, Monterey, So
noma, and Stanislaus, are being sur
veyed. These counties were selected
because each is typical of the prob
lent, has some sort of a junior college,
and has no large city. In order to
further state legislation for reorgani
zation, the California Teachers Asso
ciation is surveying six. or seven other
counties.
