With the warm weather falling suddenly on our necks like this, and
the let-up after midquarters beckoning us to lighter and liner tilings in
life than the drudgery of study, it is a happy coincidence that something
as interesting yet cooling as a swimming meet is at hand. I lowever,
beside being a beneficial diversion, this contest a week from Kridav con
tains a number of features which should be of interest to the general
public in any weather. Iwo of the entrants, a couple of regular Stanford
men, are famous throughout the world for their prowess with the spring
board : Pete Desjardins and Kd Throndson are worthv of vour considera
tion as an event bv themselves.
I hen theer is the special 150-yard freestyle. With the number of ex
ceptional swimmers in college this summer this race should prove an
excellent climax to an afternoon of sport, led Wigit, an entering frosh,
has a record behind him that should justify any hopes in his direction
by Stanford and her well-wishers: his performance in the meet should
be watched. John Gardner, another entrant in the contest, has made, in
the opinion of Myron Sprague, director of the meet, "the most pheno
menal progress in one year of any man who has come to the I niversity."
Dave Thomas, a returning varsity letterman. has already shown his
ability in previous contests.
However, this does not mean that the average student has no chance
in the meet. These others will be limited to exhibitions or the special
150-yard swim. Therefore, any and all who have any ability in the
aquatic line are urged to turn out.
Those not participating will miss an exceptional show if they fail to
l>e in the bleachers. As the only event of its type this summer, it is of
interest in one war or another to all connected with the I niversitv.
