# HORSE SHOW IS GOOD ENTERTAINMENT
## 
### 
'I ho horse show that opens this week-end on the campus is an attrac
tion for everybody, whether versed in the fine points of horses or not.
Everybody loves horses, even,if lie can't tell a prize-winner from any
other good-looking animal until the judges award the ribbons.
Likewise, everybody can enjoy the actions of the animals as they are
made to display their excellences, whether he understands wherein those
excellences lie or not. You don't have to be an expert to get very real
enjoyment from watching those fine-bred horses as tliev are put through
iheir paces.
The whole affair is a stirring picture of motion and life under the
brilliant lights in the evening, with the band playing a quick-step. It* you
have never been you ought to go at least once just for the experience and
the novel thrill. And the probability is that if you go once you'll go again.
