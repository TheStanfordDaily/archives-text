# STRANGE SECTS

### 
Always an enthusiastic rival. Stanford is determined not to be outdone
by the I Diversity of California. While Stanford usually leads the way
and l .C. follows, the latter recently achieved the doubtful distinction of
having the first atheist club formed on its campus. Now. despite the
lact that sundry laughs have been accused of downdright "cussedness,"
it is extremely .doubt ful if the atheists can muster sufficient strength to
organize a club here. However, one should not feel discouraged for we
can boast of our own strange sect.
Daily the members of this sect may be seen walking or riding in
groups of twos and threes toward the temple of their gods. Joyful
strides and happy faces make them distinctive as they hurry to prostrate
themselves helore the god Sol and to thrash about before the god Nep
tune. If they perform the necessary sacrifices old Sol will reward them
with a new coat of tan and Xeptune will cool them on the hottest summer
day. It is really remarkable how many students these gods have in their
clutches. Many could not be driven away from their daily trip to the
temples at Encina and Uoble gyms.
Like anything, sunbathing and swimming can be carried to extremes,
yet in moderate amounts there are fewthings to equal them for health
fulness. Serious injury is often caused bv rash attempts to gain a
fashionable tan in a single day. However, short exposures to the sun
each day wlil give one that healthy tan that is so greatly desired and at
the same time eliminate any possibility of an excess of ultraviolet ravs
breaking down the delicate tissues of the body.
Perhaps you are already a member of this sect, but if not you should
hasten to reap the benefits that the others are already gaining. There is
nothing like a cool swim these hot days to refresh you mentally and
physically. Fifteen or twenty minutes of basking in the sun daily will
bring a glow of health and possibly will make you forget, at least tem
porarily. that you are due to have three exe, the next day. Let the
I'niversitv of California have its atheist club, we prefer our sect that
revels in the ultraviolet.
