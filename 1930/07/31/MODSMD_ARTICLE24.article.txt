Sleepy Sain wants to know it' the
University had those banana plants
set out in tlie Inner Quad court for
j the benefit of the students who are
always making monkeys out of them
selves.
We know that he doesn't mean the
| l'resh in en particularly because he says
that he is eagerly looking forward to
' the day when he can frolic among
the ripening bananas.
By that time there'll be no fresh
men here.
If the bananas actually grow, think
of the competition the Cellar is going
to have.
The question arises as to which will
j give the quickest service.
Sam claims that an order left with
the banana plants now will be filled
before a waiter reaches you at the
Cellar.
However, we believe that Sam is
exaggerating and anyway we can't
see how the plants are going to split
the bananas for a banana split.
Perhaps some local Burbank can
'cross them with sword grass and en
j able them to split their own.

Don't get excited, though, they were

novelty anyway.

now that mid-terms are over.

How can profs expect us to play a
good card game and keep up with
their enthusiasms?
A dear, earnest, middle-aged sight
seeing lady stopped us by the post
office, yesterday, and asked us, "Can
j you tell me where Stanford ITniver-
I sity is?"
This is the honest truth. No kidding.
She had doubtless seen Hoover's
home, but didn't want to no away
without at least a glance at the Uni
| versity.
; Had us bothered for the proper
answer; just the right lone of friendly
deference, you know.
J But we got it before it was tor) late.
| Our good early training.
Always mothers little gentleman.
