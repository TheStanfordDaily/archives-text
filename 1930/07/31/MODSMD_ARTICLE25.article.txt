{says: "Lately we have noticed that a
i number of people are turning the
| water on their lawns and letting ii
| run until (he lawns become saturated.
lln addition, a great quantity goes
down the gutter. This is a waste that
i must stop. If it continues we shall
| put meters on all these houses. One
half an hour two days a week will
!give the average lawn enough, and
I allowing the water to run any longer
'means waste."
In addition to the irrigation supply
from Searsville and Felt lakes, the
University is pumping 360,000 gallons
of water from the wells for domestic
I purposes.
"The water level in the wells has
dropped eighty feet in the past eiglit
i een years. When the wells were first
dug, water was reached at forty feet,
now it. is necessary to go one hundred
and twenty feet," says Edward Water
man, engineer of the pumping plant.
In view of this situation it is asked
that everyone be careful not to waste
