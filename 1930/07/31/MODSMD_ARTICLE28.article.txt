Contrary to newspaper reports that
R. Lud Frentrup and Don Kobesky
will play for the Olympic Club foot
hall team next reason, words comes
from Frentrup that both Kobesky and
himself are undecided whether or not
they will play.
It is true that Percy Locey, coach
of the club team, has approached both
players with intention of signing them
up, but the former Stanford grid
heroes are doubtful if they will ac
cept the honor.
