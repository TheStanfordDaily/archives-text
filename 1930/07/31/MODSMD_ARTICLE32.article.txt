of New South Wales, at luncheon in
the patio of tlie Stanford Union, Sat
urday.

University grounds during the after
noon.
Somerset Dechaire announced his
intention to study at Stanford some
time in the near future. While still
a freshman at Oxford, lie is a recog
nized author on international rela
tions. His book on this subject, "The
Impending Storm," is considered by
eminent critics both in America and
England, a profound work for a boy
of eighteen.
"Another war is threatening the
world which, if it comes, will be im
possible of description today, but this
war may be prevented if people can
only realize its imminence," says the
youthful author.
"I would like to see the youth of
the world quit worrying about the
lootball score and give a hand in
solving the important world problems
lodav. The idea that only the oldsters
(ran handle economic and social prob
lems is in my opinion all wrong."
Lieutenant Dechaire is on leave
from the Royal British Navy to travel
with his father and mother on their
return trip to England.
The party returned to San Fran
cisco to meet Admiral and Lady De
chaire. They are to be the guests of

for several weeks, at the end of which
time they will continue on their re
turn trip to England.

to private life upon his arrival.
