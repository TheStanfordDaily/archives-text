# REQUEST FOR MOONEY BILLINGS PARDON IS DECLARED INACTIVE
## 
### 
"With the present evidence of per
jury tin the part of the witnesses in
the case of Thomas Mooney and War
ren K. Billings, Pi Sigma Alpha, po
litical organization of Stanford, is no
longer active in asking Governor
Young to pardon these men," says
Professor E. A. Cottrell of the Politi
cal Science department.
Pi Sigma Alpha circulated a petition
last year asking the pardon for these
two men, following an address given
by Fremont Older, editor of the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin, in which lie
discussed the cases of 'Mooney and
Hillings; When the petition was sent
to Governor Young it caused nation
wide comment.
Since that time several witnesses
have come forward and admitted that
they perjured themselves at this trial.
This aspect has caused the Governor
to ask the State Supreme Court for a
thorough investigation by means of
an informal hearing unprecedented in
legal history. Although the Governor
lias the power to pardon Mooney lie
has consistently refused to do so.
John Mac Donald, 011 whose testi
mony Mooney and Billings were con
victed of the Preparedness Day bomb
ing in San Francisco in 1916, has
gone before the Supreme Court and
confessed that he perjured himself
during the trial. Mac Donald says that
he was coached by members of the
San Francisco police department
when he idthtifled Mooney and Bil
lings as the two men he saw planting
the bomb.
The members of the San Francisco
police department deny that they had
any part in Mac Donald's identifying
the convicted men.
During the years that Mooney and
Billings have been in prison they have
consistently refused to ask for a par
don, claiming that such a request
would be an admittance of guilt. Pro
fessor Cottrell explained to a reporter,
Their desire has been to have the
case reopened and reviewed from the
beginning. This has just been made
possible by the return of John Mac-
Donald to California.
