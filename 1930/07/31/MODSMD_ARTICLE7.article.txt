Intersectional games with Minne
sota and Dartmouth, in addition to
the traditional battles with U.C. and
U.S.'C., add spice to the 1930 football
schedule for Stanford's big Red team.
Eleven games, eight of them in the
j home stadium, will give tlie Cardinals

i and versatility that have given them

wheel, is due to get its trial run the
I afternoon of September 20, when the

Cagle's teammates will bolster the
j Army squad. A week later the strong
i Olympic Club eleven will attempt to
