# CELLAR SERVICE TO BE SIMPLIFIED; SAME HOURS WILL BE KEPT
## 
### 
The Cellar will remain open
from 7:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. as
usual, although service in the
evenings will be simplified he
ginning tomorrow, was the an
nouncement made by Miss Etta
Handy, director of dining halls,
yesterday. The Cellar closed
about this time last summer and
Miss Handy lias been uncertain
as to whether or not it. would be
possible to keep it open this year.
Cutting down the labor at. the
Cellar is the intention during
this period of adjustment, while
the staff discovers how much
business is carried on after the
first-term students leave.
During the evenings fewer
elaborate orders, such as fried
food or very ornate toasted
sandwiches, will be served. How
ever, the toasters and some
other equipment will be placed
at the counter at night, enabling
the simpler orders to be filled.
Booth service in the evening
has not yet. been decided on.
Miss Handy asks that those who
sit at the counter try to fill the
end nearest the Union Store
first, thereby causing less labor
for Ihe employees, who find that
time is lost by ruslfing from one
end of the counter to the other.
