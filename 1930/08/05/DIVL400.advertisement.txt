putting on the RITZ
If you've been waiting for a foundation that is so light you ~~\ V B
positively won't know you're wearing a thing—you'll be VvW /
putting on the RITZ as soon as you see it.
It's a special Nemoflex summer foundation of soft pliant jrl 1 J
rayon which smooths your figure just enough. jl* ' J J 'a 6
There isn't a bone in it and it's as easily washable as any j/\ AJ
lingerie. Just take off the detachable shoulder straps and I XI
slip off the garters. (They're special new garters by the MfM J <H
way, with a lot of stretch so that they won't make runs in Ij' jm y aU *•
your hose, and they haven't any bumpy buckle to show h V'
through a thin frock. You can make them longer or shorter 11l tk / /|Sl|
as you wish.) ']
The RITZ is a garment made for youth and for young fig- \ W I'
ures. Our stock disappears almost faster than we can re- \ ' |yjfl/|f|jA
order, so you'd better hurry if you're-going to be "putting \ {ihjhi'll.|\
on the RITZ." \ V
