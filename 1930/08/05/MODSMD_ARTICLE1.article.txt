# CHICAGO NOT SO BAD AS PICTURED DECLARES KENT
## Visiting Professor Deplores Tendency of People to Blame Laws for Crime Mobilization of Social and Educational Resources Is Necessary for Solution

"Jlow many machine gun bullets
have you had to duck while in Chi
cago?"
"I am amused but, not surprised
when my friends ask me this," stated
Arthur 11. Kent, acting associate pro
fessor of law for the summer quarter
from I lie University of Chicago. "I am
no) surprised, considering the deplor
able conditions to which law and
order have fallen in Chicago, yet it
is only a representation of many other
cities of the United States, only
greatly magnified."
Success or failure in re-establish
incut of justice there is a problem of
nation-wide interest as the same prob
lem will have to be solved in other
parts of this country.
Defects in Illinois Laws
"II seems to he characteristic of Ihe
American people," lie continued, "to
blame the present laws for these con
ditions and to look to legislation to
correct them. It would be foolish to
deny the fact that criminal law and
procedure in Illinois do not contain
many gross defects and worn-out
statutes from earlier cases which may
be corrected by legislation and by de
veloping a better spirit within the bar
and the judges on the bench. There
is no doubt that members of the
criminal gangs and organizations arc
rendered relatively safe by inefficient
legal machinery.
"It would be superficial in view of
the situation to conclude that condi
tions in Chicago can be cured by legal
magic or by'any revision of the
statutes relating to laws of criminal
procedure. In the first place the legis
lature is limited in reconstructing
these haws by constitutional guaran
tees, state Mill of Rights, and the
strict interpretation made by the Su
preme Court.

"Others blame the states attorney
for the lack of proper enforcement of
laws, yet he is severely handicapped
when opposed by the clever and un
scrupulous lawyers hired for (lie de
fense of the members of the gangs.
"The effort has been made by ex
treme wets to shift the responsibility
lor conditions to the Eighteenth
Amendment. This, too, is superficial
in accordance with a clear view of
the situation. Organized gangs existed
many years before the Volstead Law.
They concentrated their energies on
bank and payroll robberies and the
control of vice in tlie city."
Nevertheless, Mr. Kent believes,
prohibition has complicated problems
of crime prevention because it has
placed the means of obtaining a reve
nue running into millions of dollars
into the hands of the lawless. This
lias enabled the gang leaders to buy
protection of faithless public officials
and even to win influence in political
machines and organs in Cook county.
"Even Tammany Hall in the days
of Moss Tweed was not guilty of some
of the excess which recent investiga
tions of municipal affairs in Chicago
revealed," says Professor Kent.

"Despite this dark picture of af
fairs Chicago is not entirely without
hope, business leaders are beginning
to realize that if this city is to fulfill
its destiny as a financial and indus
trial center, conditions must change.
If these leaders can be aroused to a
point of taking charge of the munici
pal affairs and political parties, crime
can he removed to a great exlent.
"Any permanent solution, however,
must look to a better mobilization of
the educational and social resources
of the city to the wild of the assimila
tion of the large foreign elements and
the sterilization of the conditions and
forces encouraging the development
of lawless gangs in certain sections.
Studies which are being made by so
cial scientists of the midwestern uni
versities show a very distinct correla
tion between the criminal and certain
environmental factors found in some
sections of the city.
"It is to be hoped that the data
which the scientists are collecting
may in time show the way to effect a
program for dealing with these con
ditions, but it seems that many years
must elapse before the results of the
fundamental attacks on Chicago make
themselves felt."
