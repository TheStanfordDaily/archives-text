# Macy Calls High Tariff Rates Unfair
## U.S. Policy Is Inconsistent With Demands for War Debt Repayment 
### 
"The protective tariff policy
of the United States, us evidenced by
recent legislation, is inconsistent with
our demands for repayment of the
European debt," said C. Ward Macy
in an interview yesterday. Macy is an
economist from Coe College, Cedar
liapids, lowa, and is in the Depart
ment of Economics this summer.
"International debts are paid pri
marily with goods. Before the Great.
War, when we were a debtor nation,
we paid the interest and principle on
our debts to Europe chiefly by ex
ports. This enabled us to maintain
the so-called "favorable balance of
trade," said Macy.
It was pointed oul that since the
war the United States is a creditor
nation, and is demanding the pay
ment of the debts incurred by Europe.
Interest and principle are due, and
wo demand that they be paid, but at
the same time we establish higher
tariffs than ever. This is making il
increasingly difficult; for Europe to
pay. Eventually we will need to im
port, if we continue our demands for
Euro pea 11 set. 11 ein en ts.
Macy's second point against the new
tariff is that it is detrimental to our
exporters, who cannot buy from us
unless they can sell to us. "The
greater our tariff, the greater the dif
ficulty in disposing of our exportable
surpluses," he insisted, and gave an
example of retaliation tariffs in oilier
countries, as in Canada, which ac
centuate this difficulty.
Other economists have shown I heir
position on this question to be very
similar to that of Professor Macy.
Last winter, when the tariff bill was
pending, 1,000 economists from 170
institutions wrote a formal protest
which was sent to Congress and to
President Hoover. This protest con
veyed the opinion that, high tariffs
are not conducive to general welfare,
in the minds of the economists of the
country.
