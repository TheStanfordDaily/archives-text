# GAS SUBSTITUTED FOR OIL IN STEAM PLANT
## 
### 
Work lias begun in changing I lie
fire boxes of (lie steam plant from
oil-burning to gas. > The complete
change will be made in all the fur
naces by April of next year. This
change is being made because the
use of oil involves added expense in
transporting the oil from Redwood
City by truck. The railroad tracks are
to be torn up which will make it im
possible to switch oil cars onto the
campus.
It is expected that the use of gas
will do away with considerable dirt
and sootiness and will give a hotter
fire; however, oil will be kept on
hand in case of emergency.
