# CAMPUS PRODUCTION OF "BROADWAY" WELL RECEIVED
## 
### BY GEORGE F. MOTT. JR 
While "Broa,dway" as produced on
the Stanford stage Friday night was
good entertainment, and well re
ceived by the audience if one can
judge by the applause it seemed to
lack the finish that has characterized
so many Stanford plays.
In all fairness to the cast and the
director, it must be admitted that it
was a difficult play to produce, and
then perhaps one is apt to be a little,
too critical of amateur productions.
We hesitate to compare "Broadway"
directly with Gay's "Beggar's Opera,"
in which there was not a respectable
character, but we were reminded of
this old production.
Play Did Not Drag
The play was a good picture of
what undoubtedly exists, it was a pic
ture of a cross-section of American
city life, and the production did not
drag; it whs rapid, interesting, and at
times amusing. Every person in the
play showed evidence of trying to
slay in character, and most of tlieni
diil, but there was a coarseness and

ja crudity in the piny itself that was
J jllst a little out of place 011 the Stan
| ford stage, or on any college stage,
I for that ma t ter.
i Taking the lead in this story of
, gangland was Burnell Gould, lie was
j convincing. In fact, it may be said
I that lie carried the vehicle. Gould did
|an excellent piece of acting it, would
have been dull without his pep.
Ethel Livingston, taking the part of
j Lil Rice, did a beautiful piece of
| caricature, Terence Geddis as Steve
Crandall gave a good interpretation
iof the part, being particularly strong
;in the first two acts, and Gailiard
i Fryer as the detective showed himself
|as one who could "feel" his part wit 11 -
lout over-acting it.
Characterization Work Good
Nellie Chapman as Millie Moore was
typically the "nice" girl among the
I group of tough chorines. Pearl, as
played by Catherine Crary, was ade
quately done, but unfortunately it
I would seem as though this part was
I miscast —one had that feeling.
i Jack Jago as Nick Verdis, Kri Rich
j ardson as Joe, Tom Pike as Dolpli,
Vernon Codry as' "Porky," Harry
Logan as "Scar" Edwards, and Grace
! Garrett as Katie all showed talent,
and helped, in proportion to their
j parts, to make the play convincing
I and realistic.
In Hie chorus, Carolyn Hall as Ruby
{did a clever bit of characterization in
| the third act, and she and the rest
!of the chorus, which consisted of
j Helen Thompson, Constance Morse,
land JOlgie Ogier, in addition to those
mentioned previously, were alive, defi
nite, and effective in their roles. The
I gangsters, who were the personifica
tion of toughness, completed the cast.
Frederick Stover's set, the private
party room, was one of the best of its
i kind we have seen.
