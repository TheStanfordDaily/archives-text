# TO BE STRANDED IN FOG IS NO FUN FOR ROBLE WOMEN
## 
### 
To be stranded or lost in a
fog is far from pleasant, accord
ing to two Roble women.
One girl tells of her experience
on board a yacht on which a
party was returning from an
ocean trip. The yacht stuck fast
on a sand bar near the Dumbar
ton bridge. Some of the party,
who had never been on a yacht
before, and were going on the
trip for a sensation, got all the
sensation they wanted, for the
fog was cold and wet, and sev
eral became seasick. The boat
could not be moved until the
tide rose next morning.
Another girl and her escort, re
turning from an afternoon beach
party at San Gregorio by way of
the La Honda grade, after tak
ing the wrong road in the fog,
found themselves near San Jose
at 4 o'clock in the morning.
