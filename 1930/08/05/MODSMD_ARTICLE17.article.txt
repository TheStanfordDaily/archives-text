# DOWNES CLOSES SERIES OF TALKS
## New York Critic Speaks On Contemporary Music 
### 
Ending his popular series of talks
on music, Olin Downes, the music
critic for the New York Times, yes
terday spoke on "Contemporaneous
Musical Drift." This was continued
from his talk last Thursday, in which
he spoke of Beethoven and the dawn
of t lie modern era in music.
Starting with Richard Wagner,
Downes said that "Wagner gave a
sensation of not being tied to one
key, but of including the whole fab
ric." He went on to tell of Wagner's
use of chromatic harmony, demon
strating with selections on the piano
| how Wagner could use seven notes in
l an endless melody with great variety,
lit! also spoke of the influence of
Claudio Montiverri, who, early in the
seventeenth century, introduced the
suiting of music to the scene iu opera.
Liszt, who kept more to the field
of the symphonic poem, also was an
j influence on Wagner, according to
! Downes, who showed how Liszt, could
transform one theme by different in
terpretations.
After Wagner, came Richard
Strauss. Downes played part of his
symphonic poem, "Till Eulenspiegel,"
and demonstrated the skill with which
Strauss wove the whole thing around
two simple themes.
The last important composer since
Wagner, according to the New York
critic, was the Frenchman, Claude
Debussy, who composed impression
j istic harmony. "Debussy's chords
! seem to open out like the spreading
'tail of a peacock," said Downes. He
j played part of the "Reflets dans
; I'Eau."
"One of these days some genius will
| come who can carry on the work of
these great composers," was Olin
Downes' concluding statement.
Downes last night attended the con
| cert of lilac's Abas Quartet in San
I Francisco, and is to give a lecture in
I C'armel today. He-will return to New
j York after attending a series of con
| certs in Hollywood Bowl.
