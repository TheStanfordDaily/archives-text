# STANFORD DISSECTED AGAIN
## 
### 
Robert I). Speers, editor of the Stanford Daily last quarter, has a
piece about the I Diversity in the current issue of Collrr/c llniuor. As
might be expected from the magazine for which il was written, the article
aims to be entertaining, is not too considerate of local regulations, and
is not, in fact, designed to be reprinted bodilv and broadcasted for
booster purposes.
Inevitably its publication invites comparison with the article in the
current .Iwrrican Mercury, which also w;is framed to titillate and not to
be ;i local chamber of commerce pamphlet.
Speers' piece stands the comparison test satisfactorily. It's honest,
for one thingâ€”the chief thing. It is an article that ;i Stanford man need
not be ashamed of writing about his own university. Not that all Stanford
people will agree with his views in every particular. Some of the things
that he says will arouse a degree of resentment among some readers, no
doubt. Xot all that he puts down as facts really are facts. Ilut underlying
the whole article is an evident sincerity. J Job Speers slams at things he
honestly doesn't approve of: he didn't set'" himself to thinking up ways
in which he might misconstrue and distort Stanford history and Stanford
ways for the sake of cooking up a snappy article.
As a result Stanford shows up in Speers' presentation, despite his
lightness of treatment and his digs at ;i number of things here on the
campus, as a pretty fair sort of an institution, when all is said and done.
Xo need to be ashamed of the university I Job Speers shows the world.
That's what he himself thinks.
