# BIGGER AND BETTER QUARTERS

### 
The Daily rejoices in the generosity of a kind-hearted administration!
which is building it a bigger home for its next year's activities. The
other publications are being provided with larger offices than they have i
had heretofore upstairs in the remodeled Press Uuilding. Instead of
half-inch board partitions that shook under the agitated tread of bar-,
rassed editors and business managers and a depressing dull gray paint, !
they are to have solidly built cubicles decorated in blending shades of j
restful green.
J Jut that got the Daily in its little bungalow nowhere except to aj
point of work-wrecking envy. 15ut now, thanks be, the Daily, also, is :
10 share in the amplified and improved housing that has included the |
l uiversity Press, mechanical and clerical, the Journalism division, and
the other student publications. The Daily won't worry about plaster j
walls and esthetic color schemes; what is needed was more room for!
the business manager and his staff and the editor and his staff, and it
will have it.
()ld-timcrs tell of llic days when the little old hand set student news- j
paper perched its offices where it could find a vacant corner near the |
J'ress. Little by little, through the co-operation of sympathetic officials'
and particularly since the l uiversity Press began its own development
under its present head, the Daily has gained more efficient equipment
for its mechanical handling and more convenient quarters for its re
porters, editors, and money-handlers. Xo college paper could ask for 1
better composing room and press facilities than the Daily now enjoys.
And il will get along very comfortably in its own brain-shop as it
is foing to be next year, thank you.
