Crossword puzzles, yoyo's, and tree-sitting have been relegated to tlie
obscure background by the latest of indoor sports. Thomas A. Edison
lias bad a babit of turning up every now and then with some new inven
tion to keep a noveltv-loving public awake. I ; irst it was the electric bulb
that made possible the bright lights of the big city. Then came the
phonograph and the radio to add their din to the riveting hammers and
asthmatic Fords.
Xow he has scored another success in his long line of headache pro
ducers. Intended only as another worry for the forty-nine boys who
were taking his famous examination, it has nevertheless swept the
country. If you see several people on the corner waving their arms
wildly and shouting madly, don't call the paddy wagon, they may only
be trying to decide what they would do if there were six men in ;i
boat 011 a wild sea and the oars leaked.
Edison, of course, wanted to know what the youthful quiz-taker as a
leader of a party of eight would do if lost in the'desert with only food
and water enough for three people to reach safety, the rest to be left
to perish. The party consisted of a brilliant scientist. (>() years old: two
half-breed guides: the scientist's wife, age who has social aspirations;
her six-year-old son: vour fiancee; your best friend, who has shown
great promise in the field of science: and yourself.
Although none of the forty-nine boys replied that he would save
himself, it is interesting to note that in<>>t of the older men have declared
that thev would save their best friend, the fiancee, and themselves, t an
this imply that our youth have higher ideals than the older people or
does it mean that the stern realities of life have tempered the ideals of
the older ones?
Perhaps after all Dr. Marry A. Overstreet, head of the department
of philosophy, College of the City of New York, had the right answer
when he said, "Why not perish the lot and let it go at that? I can see
no logic in the question."
Which all leads to the fact that, try as we may, we can see no logic
in the whole business of selecting the most brilliant boy in the country
to the accompaniment of a fanfare of trumpets and the blaze of s]>ot
lights. One may well question the ultimate effect <>n the lad finally
selected. Will the publicity prove harmful or will he be able to succeed
despite it? Look at last year's winner: be came down with a severe case
of the mumps not three months after winning.

Crossword puzzles, yoyo's, and tree-sitting have been relegated to tlie
obscure background by the latest of indoor sports. Thomas A. Edison
lias bad a babit of turning up every now and then with some new inven
tion to keep a noveltv-loving public awake. I ; irst it was the electric bulb
that made possible the bright lights of the big city. Then came the
phonograph and the radio to add their din to the riveting hammers and
asthmatic Fords.
Xow he has scored another success in his long line of headache pro
ducers. Intended only as another worry for the forty-nine boys who
were taking his famous examination, it has nevertheless swept the
country. If you see several people on the corner waving their arms
wildly and shouting madly, don't call the paddy wagon, they may only
be trying to decide what they would do if there were six men in ;i
boat 011 a wild sea and the oars leaked.
Edison, of course, wanted to know what the youthful quiz-taker as a
leader of a party of eight would do if lost in the'desert with only food
and water enough for three people to reach safety, the rest to be left
to perish. The party consisted of a brilliant scientist. (>() years old: two
half-breed guides: the scientist's wife, age who has social aspirations;
her six-year-old son: vour fiancee; your best friend, who has shown
great promise in the field of science: and yourself.
Although none of the forty-nine boys replied that he would save
himself, it is interesting to note that in<>>t of the older men have declared
that thev would save their best friend, the fiancee, and themselves, t an
this imply that our youth have higher ideals than the older people or
does it mean that the stern realities of life have tempered the ideals of
the older ones?
Perhaps after all Dr. Marry A. Overstreet, head of the department
of philosophy, College of the City of New York, had the right answer
when he said, "Why not perish the lot and let it go at that? I can see
no logic in the question."
Which all leads to the fact that, try as we may, we can see no logic
in the whole business of selecting the most brilliant boy in the country
to the accompaniment of a fanfare of trumpets and the blaze of s]>ot
lights. One may well question the ultimate effect <>n the lad finally
selected. Will the publicity prove harmful or will he be able to succeed
despite it? Look at last year's winner: be came down with a severe case
of the mumps not three months after winning.
