# STEW USED FOR GLUE? Irish Plead "Not Guilty" L. A. MAKES STICKERS
## 
### 
Psychologists tfll us lliat only live
per cent of men and scarcely any
women are color blind in so far as
red and green are concerned. The
Stanfordite can hardly believe that
this select five per cent have settled
in Los Angeles and are distributing
windshield stickers to sons of the
Cardinal.
However, the words "made in Ire
land" may be found beneath the seal
on every Stanford sticker, and the
business men who have allowed the
Land of Erin to substitute Cardinal
for the "wearing of the green" can
be located in a Los Angeles firm.
Excuses are made by some, claim
ing that a few of the substances re
quired are found only in Ireland, it
has even been suggested that the
glue on the backs of the stickers is
remindful of a well-seasoned Irish
stew.
In spite of any excuses offered, the
fact remains that, in any place far
from home, when one car bearing a
round red seal toots recognition to
another car with a round red seal, both
give credit to the land of the Sham
rock, not to mention a certain firm
in the South.
