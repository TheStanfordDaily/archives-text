# BEETHOVEN FEATURED BY HOOGSTRATEN AT WOODLAND CONCERT
## 
### 
An admirable presentation of
Beetlioven's Fifth Symphony marked
the opening of Willem van Hoogstra
ten's fivet concert, Sunday, in the
Woodland Theatre.
The C minor Symphony is probably
tin- best-known and most-admired of
Hie immortal nine, perhaps because
il is the most human in its qualities.
In the Fifth, as in the Third Sym
phony, is favored that concentration
of thought and labor which makes
these two musical poems so all-power
lti 1 and overwhelming in their effect.
Sunday's playing of this tremendous
composition under van Iloogstraten's
direction proved to be entirely ade
quate, for the immensity of the work.
Gypsy Spirit Characterizes Playing
The first number after the Intermis
sion was the Overture-Fantasia from
"Borneo and Juliet" by Tschaikowsky.
This unusual work is scored only for
piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two
clarinets, English horn, two bassoons,
lour horns, two "trumpets, and three
trombones, bass tuba, a set of three
kettledrums, cymbals, harp, and
.strings. It represents a conflict be
tween the "burden of fate" and the
love theme.
Following this selection Debussy's
Prelude to "The Afternoon of a Faun"
was played. The rendition was charac
terized by a delicacy and clearness
necessary for an effective musical in
terpretation of a simple, sensuous
faun.
Three Hungarian Dances of Brahms
closed ihe program. They were played
in the true abandon of Gypsy spirit.
Van iloogstraten seemed to thorough
ly enjoy himself while he -was con
ducting these famous dances so filled
with the joy and sorrow of human
emotion.
Madrid Conductor Comes Next
Van Hoogstraten's concert next
Sunday will include the Overture from
the Music to Shakespeare's "A Mid
summer Night's Dream" by Men
delsshon, Symphony in E flat major
by Mozart, "Till Eulinspiegel" by
Strauss, Berlioz's "Damnation of
Faust," and Three Excerpts by Gluck-
Mottl.
This will be the Portland conduc
tor's last appearance with the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in the
Woodland Theatre this season. The
concert 011 August 17 will be con
ducted by E. Fernandez Arbos of the
Madrid Symphony Orchestra in Spain,
outsiders.
