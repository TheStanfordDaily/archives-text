# KRENZ, HABLES UNABLE TO COMPETE IN A.A.U.
## 
### 
Eric Krenz, Stanford track captain,
and Les Hables, crack Cardinal
.sprinter, will not complete in the Na
tional A.A.U. track and field cham
pionships. These two athletes had
'been counted on to aid the Olympic
flub retain the national title which it
(won last year.
Krenz is carefully nursing a strained
!back, and Hables, who is attending
jsummer quarter at Stanford, will be
unable to compete because the meet,
;which is to be held in Pittsburgh, Au
gust. 22, and 25, would interfere
(with finals.
i The loss of Hables and Krenz, with
that of some other choice athletes,
makes it possible that the Olympic
;( lull, which was conceded an excel
lent chance to again defeat the field,
will withdraw from the meet. Ward
iKdmonds, in the pole vault, and John
Kazanjian, in the weight and hammer
it brows, were also unable to accept
the Olympic Club's invitation to com
pete. Harlow Rothert. in the shotput,
and Kim Dyer, in the broadjump, have
signified their intention to represent
the club. All of these men are former
Stanford athletes.
