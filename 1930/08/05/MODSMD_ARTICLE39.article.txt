# WOODBERRY BOOKS, THE GIFT OF PROF. SEWARD, EXHIBITED
## 
### 
Twenty-two books, many of them
first editions, are in the collection pre
sented to the Library recently by
| Professor Samuel S. Seward of the
English department. The volumes,
which are in the cases to the right
as one ascends the stairs to the loan
j desk, constitute the Woodberrv Col
lection, and will be added to the Char
lotte Ashley Felton Memorial Library.
George Edward Woodberrv, an
American poet, was on the faculty of
the English department of Columbia
1 University when Professor Seward
was a student there from to 1899.
Woodberry died last January, and
| Professor Seward, who had admired
him and his work, has given to the
j Library the books which he collected.
Among them are many books of
poetry, several volumes published by
the Woodberry Society, and one by
John Erskine, "An Appreciation of
j Woodberry."
Other Editions on Display
The Charlotte Ashley' Felton Me
morial Room, where the Woodberry
' books will be placed after they are
| removed from the display cases, is a
room containing English and Araeri
j can books which were presented to
I the Library by Mrs. Kate Felton El
kins, in honor of her mother, Char
lotte Ashley Felton. Most of the books
I are by nineteenth century authors,
j and there are many valuable first edi
tions among them, such as those of
1 Mark Twain, Hawthorne, Conrad,
! Masefield, and Bret Harte. Besides the
books, there are photographs and auto
j graphs of English and American
j writers.
In cases to the left are recent ad-
I ditions to the Bender collection and
! new and valued additions to the li-

I brary. I
Two notable facsimilies are on dis
play in the cases by the Library stairs.
One is a facsimile of the manuscript
of Virgil, with marginal notes by
Petrarch, which is one ot' the treas
ures of the Ambrosian Library at
Milan. This volume was purchased
by the Library through the Typo
graphical Fund established by Albert
M. Bender. The facsimile, which was
issued this year in honor of the
2,000 th anniversary of Virgil's birth,
is bound in wood, and is an accurate
representation of the original, even
down to the dust on the leaves, and
to one torn page.
Values Facsimile Shown
The other facsimile is the Codex j
' Argenteus, a copy of the most valued ;
; treasure of the University of Upsala j
jin Sweden. The Swedish University |
; sent it to Stanford as a gift. The j
Argentus is in Gothic, and con
| ftiins fragments of the Gospels in j
l Gothic, in the order of Matthew, John, I
Luke, and Mark, all written in silver
! letters on mulberry colored vellum.
! Only IN7 leaves of the original 330 j
I are in the volume, which was written ]
I in the fifth or sixth century. It was
j apparently the book which Mercator,
| son of the geographer, saw in Wes- i
phalia in the sixteenth century. The :
| book was captured by the Swedes at j
j the siege of Prague in 1648! and was
given to Queen Christina. Il came to
the University of Upsala in 10G9.
Another interesting volume on dis- i
I play is the property of Nathan Van I
j Patten, Director of Libraries. It is the \
\ "Birds of Rhiannon," a grove play, |
| which is to be presented by the Bo- j
i liejnian Club of San Francisco at their :
j annual High Jinks this Saturday.
