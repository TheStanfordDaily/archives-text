# CHURCH CHALLENGED BY RADIO AND MOVIE DECLARES DR. BROWN
## 
### 
Four great adversaries —the radio,
ilic movies, the automobile, and the
cra'ie for amusement—are challenging
I lie churches today. This was the
opinion expressed by the Rev. Charles
R. Brown of Vale University, in his
sermon in the Memorial Church Sun
flay.
"The difference," Dr. Brown said,
"between listening to a sermon over
the radio and going to church, is like
I lie difference between talking to a
young lady over the telephone and
spending the evening with her. Reli
gion is personal, it can't be put on
the wire."
Speaking of the automobile, Dr.
Brown explained that there are
enough automobiles in the country so
thai every one can get in and drive
away from the ministers. These Sun
day expeditions are supposedly taken
for the purpose of "worshipping na
ture."
Movies Are Not Art
"Most movies, even when they are
clean rather than dirty, cannot in
any sense of the word 1)6 called art,"
Dr. Brown claims. Go to a movie and
all you see is a lot of people having
their picture taken in the social
vacuum of Hollywood. We get the
movie habit of mind, that does not
care to think or read. This is a chal
lenge to those who stand for thought
fulness and devotion to God."
Intellectual and spiritual poverty
were given as the causes for this
generation's craze for amusement and
necessity to "keep going." The ma
terialism of the age and the prevalent
uncertainty of religious faith were
also mentioned as factors in tile chal
lenge to religion.
"Religion should be a genial pres
ence in the home and parents should
I'eel that Christianity is something
necessary for their children," said
Dr. Brown. He pointed out that better
methods of religion are essential if
the churches are to meet the present
challenge.
Larger Religious Experience Needed
Other needs stressed were a finer
and nobler quality of worship on the
part of both ministers and congrega
tions; and a more inclusive grasp of
the Christian purpose, "not the res
cue of a few souls, but making the
whole ship seaworthy in all sorts of
weather."
In conclusion Rev. Brown empha
sized the importance of a larger sup
ply of religious experience. "We ex
perience religion before we under
stand any of its philosophy," he said.
"Ity knowing and rejoicing in the
spirit of God we are provided with a
driving force in all the activities of
our world."

opinion expressed by the Rev. Charles
R. Brown of Vale University, in his
sermon in the Memorial Church Sun
flay.
"The difference," Dr. Brown said,
"between listening to a sermon over
the radio and going to church, is like
I lie difference between talking to a
young lady over the telephone and
spending the evening with her. Reli
gion is personal, it can't be put on
the wire."
Speaking of the automobile, Dr.
Brown explained that there are
enough automobiles in the country so
thai every one can get in and drive
away from the ministers. These Sun
day expeditions are supposedly taken
for the purpose of "worshipping na
ture."
Movies Are Not Art
"Most movies, even when they are
clean rather than dirty, cannot in
any sense of the word 1)6 called art,"
Dr. Brown claims. Go to a movie and
all you see is a lot of people having
their picture taken in the social
vacuum of Hollywood. We get the
movie habit of mind, that does not
care to think or read. This is a chal
lenge to those who stand for thought
fulness and devotion to God."
Intellectual and spiritual poverty
were given as the causes for this
generation's craze for amusement and
necessity to "keep going." The ma
terialism of the age and the prevalent
uncertainty of religious faith were
also mentioned as factors in tile chal
lenge to religion.
"Religion should be a genial pres
ence in the home and parents should
I'eel that Christianity is something
necessary for their children," said
Dr. Brown. He pointed out that better
methods of religion are essential if
the churches are to meet the present
challenge.
Larger Religious Experience Needed
Other needs stressed were a finer
and nobler quality of worship on the
part of both ministers and congrega
tions; and a more inclusive grasp of
the Christian purpose, "not the res
cue of a few souls, but making the
whole ship seaworthy in all sorts of
weather."
In conclusion Rev. Brown empha
sized the importance of a larger sup
ply of religious experience. "We ex
perience religion before we under
stand any of its philosophy," he said.
"Ity knowing and rejoicing in the
spirit of God we are provided with a
driving force in all the activities of
our world."
