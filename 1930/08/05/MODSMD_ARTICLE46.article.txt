# WHAT? A NEW RECORD? Coccid Sleeps For 17 Years BUG SPURNS FOOD, AIR
## 
### 
So drop a tear
While standing here
For this poor slumbering coccid.
His foodless life
Was without suite
Out then, his lite was rapid.
Marathon dancing, flag-pole and
I tree-sitting contests, and airplane en-
I durance flights have nothing on a lit
! lie bug when it comes to setting rec
ords. The endurance champion is none
other than the coccid, one specimen
of which lived in a Stanford labora-
I tory without food, air, or water for
seventeen years. Now here is a record.
Professor F. G. Ferris, of the Ento
mology Department, acquired the bug
for a collection. This specimen was
| captured in its subterranean haunts
i in Chile in 1900 by a scientist named
| Lataste. Professor Cockerall brought
jit to Stanford in tlie same year. Its
' life was spent in a cyst formed by
excretions from the insect, Itself.
During the year of 1917 Professor
Ferris opened the cyst which con
tained the insect, and thought it to
j be alive. Strangely enough, he found
! it necessary to perform a histological
examination requiring l lie death of the
organism in order to establish the fact
t hat it had ever lived.
