## 
### 
| Cornell University is the recipient :
of a million-dollar law school, the gift
of Myron C. Taylor, '94, to pe ready
' by the fall quarter of 1931. The urchi- •
Itectural style of the building, colle- (
I giate Gothic, will conform to other i
new buildings on the campus, but its
, construction will be simpler.
There will be two wings, forming
i an "L." One wing will contain lecture i
! halls and model court room with seat
ing facilities for 4M2 students, and the
I other, the library, offices, conference!
| rooms, and lounges. An eight-story
j tower, forty feet square, will connect
| the wings.
The court room will have a vaulted '
| ceiling, a rostrum and places for tive '
[judges, counsel, witnesses, and court!
I attendants. This idea of such a room J
represents a distinctly new feature
in law school building construction. '
The library has accommodations for !
450,000 volumes, to be kept in stacks [
equally available to students and fac- !
I ulty.
