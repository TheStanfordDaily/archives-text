# "AFRICA" IS TOPIC OF GEOLOGIST'S LECTURETONIGHT
## Dr. Willis' Scenic Description To Be Accompanied by Illustrations Human Problems of Country To Be Considered 
### 
An illustrated lecture on "Africa"
will be given at .S o'clock tonight in
the Little Theatre by I Jr. Bailey Willis,
noted geologist and research associ
ate of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. Scenic Africa, with in
cidental remarks on its geological his
tory and human problems, will he dis
cussed.
"Africa is of interest to the geolo
gist," says Professor Willis, "not only
because it. is one of the largest, and
oldest continents, but because it has
never been submerged as have other
continents from time to time. It also
holds great economic interest as a
source of raw materials which, if ef
ficiently exploited, could upset, the
world markets. Africa presents the
contrast of inert ignorance as opposed
to driving intelligence in its most ag
gravated form.
"The European nations have sub
stituted the white man's dominance
iu place of tribal government in
Africa: they have taken control of
the future of the people. The various
conditions of administration range
from practical peonage to partial self
government. The evolution of a sys
tem which will be alike to the white
man and the black is a problem which
is taxing the wisest and most, experi
enced statesmen of England and the
Continent. It is being approached by
the International Committee of the
League of Nations, but race prejudice
and economic pressure make solution
of the question a difficult matter."
Dr. Willis, who is professor emeri
tus of geology at Stanford, recently
returned from Africa where, as repre
sentative of the Carnegie Institution,
he has been making a study of the
general causes of seismic activity.
