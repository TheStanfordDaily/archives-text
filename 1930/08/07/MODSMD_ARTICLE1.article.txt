Are there really spooks?
Professor J. K. Coover of the Psych
ology department lias photographs
taken here at Stanford, showing
white-robed individuals with transpar
ent qualities such as enable chairs,
walls, and other parts of scenery to
show through the person of the afore
mentioned "spook." Although one is
inclined to doubt the authenticity of

for the study of psychical phenomena.
No Positive Proof of Phenomena
In an interview yesterday, Profes

from which he has 110 positive proof
of psychical phenomena. "Man was
helpless when he found that the world
was not what it appeared to be," he
said, "and this accounts for the
myths and nature-worship. There are
still mysterious phenomena, but sci

lie went on to explain that the ele

our "five; senses" and more special
senses, but that every now and then a
fact enters our minds separately with
