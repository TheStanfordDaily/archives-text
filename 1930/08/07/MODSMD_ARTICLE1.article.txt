# COOVER STUDIES SPOOKS, SPIRITS, OTHER MEDIUMS
## Communication of Contents Of Posthumous Letters Has Not Been Verified Research Here Results From Interest in Spiritualism by Thomas W. Stanford 
### 
Are there really spooks?
Professor J. K. Coover of the Psych
ology department lias photographs
taken here at Stanford, showing
white-robed individuals with transpar
ent qualities such as enable chairs,
walls, and other parts of scenery to
show through the person of the afore
mentioned "spook." Although one is
inclined to doubt the authenticity of
these ghostly individuals, many of
whom have names which may have
been in the Student Directory at one
time, there are people who are con
verted to a belief in such things on
similar evidence, according to Profes
sor Coover.
Professor Coover's research is the
result of the interest that Thomas
Welton Stanford, brother of Senator
Stanford, took in spiritualism. Mr.
Stanford, on his way around the
world, found himself to be such a
poor sailor that he concluded his
journey at the first stop, Australia,
and resolved never to set forth on the
water again. During the rest, of his
life, which was spent in Australia, he
became interested in the perform
ances of spiritualistic "mediums," and
in 1912 sent a fund to the University
for the study of psychical phenomena.
No Positive Proof of Phenomena
In an interview yesterday, Profes
sor Coover told of his experiments,
from which he has 110 positive proof
of psychical phenomena. "Man was
helpless when he found that the world
was not what it appeared to be," he
said, "and this accounts for the
myths and nature-worship. There are
still mysterious phenomena, but sci
ence is the official agent, for discover
ing and explaining them."
lie went on to explain that the ele
ments of our knowledge are due to
our "five; senses" and more special
senses, but that every now and then a
fact enters our minds separately with
out being connected with sight, smell,
taste, touch, hearing, or any other
> | sense. This is generally attributed to
'intuition, or a "sixth sense," in the
Menu of the layman, "Intuition may
! result from the working of the special
senses," said I'rofessor Coover, add
ing that subliminal impressions, those
below the threshold of consciousness,
under certain circumstances influence
our conscious processes.
"Speech is an imperfect way of
communicating," he remarked, indi
cating that there are other forms of
I communication known in psychology,
i but of which laymen are still skep-
I tical.
Evidence of Poor Quality
Concerning seances, and the chances
j that we can receive messages from
' another world, Professor Coover said
| that there is no proof yet; there is
j evidence, but it is of poor quality.
| Sir Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini
j promised to send messages if it were
! possible to do so. Although spiritual
ists will claim messages purporting to
come from them as authentic, all the
well-controlled tests for communicat
ing the contents of posthumous let
ters have failed.
The case of tlie Myers letter was
given as an example. In January, 1891,
F. \V. H. Myers sent a sealed letter
to Sir Oliver Lodge in the hope that
after his death its contents might b®
communicated through some medium.
Lodge placed this letter in a vault in
a bank. Myers died in January of 19(11,
and in February of 1903, references to
the posthumous letter began to ap
pear in the automatic writing of a
certain Mrs. Verrall. During the year
seven or eight more references came
through, successively growing more
definite and insisting that the letter
should be opened for a test of the
verity of her message.
Claim of Influence Disproved
I3v July of 1904 the purported com
municator, Myers himself, stated
clearly in Mrs. Verrall's script that
tlie letter would be found to contain
i a given passage from Plato's "Sympo
; slum," and insisted that the time had
j come for the test. Accordingly, Sir j
j Oliver Lodge called together a num
ber of witnesses, and opened the let- j
tor in the rooms of the Society for |
Psychical Research, on December 13, ]
1904. The Journal of the S.P.R. states
that "it was found that there was no
resemblance between its actual con
tents and what Was alleged by the
script to be contained in it.
One of the well-known mediums,
Mrs. Maude Lord-Drake, conducted
seances for Senator and Mrs. Stan- i
ford, who hoped to receive a message
from Leland Stanford, Junior. Mrs. 1
j Drake, who was later detected in!
i fraud, claimed that her seances were |
responsible for the founding of Stan- !
j ford University.
This claim was disproved in a state
ment made by Dr. Jordan, who ;
brought to light the fact that Senator j
Stanford made his will, endowing the j
University, in April of 18S4, and first
met Mrs. Lord-Drake in October of
the same year. So the story that Stan
ford is a Camelot, founded under the
| influence of spirits, is far from being
I a true one.

journey at the first stop, Australia,
and resolved never to set forth on the
water again. During the rest, of his
life, which was spent in Australia, he
became interested in the perform
ances of spiritualistic "mediums," and
in 1912 sent a fund to the University
for the study of psychical phenomena.
No Positive Proof of Phenomena
In an interview yesterday, Profes
sor Coover told of his experiments,
from which he has 110 positive proof
of psychical phenomena. "Man was
helpless when he found that the world
was not what it appeared to be," he
said, "and this accounts for the
myths and nature-worship. There are
still mysterious phenomena, but sci
ence is the official agent, for discover
ing and explaining them."
lie went on to explain that the ele
ments of our knowledge are due to
our "five; senses" and more special
senses, but that every now and then a
fact enters our minds separately with
out being connected with sight, smell,
taste, touch, hearing, or any other
> | sense. This is generally attributed to
'intuition, or a "sixth sense," in the
Menu of the layman, "Intuition may
! result from the working of the special
senses," said I'rofessor Coover, add
ing that subliminal impressions, those
below the threshold of consciousness,
under certain circumstances influence
our conscious processes.
"Speech is an imperfect way of
communicating," he remarked, indi
cating that there are other forms of
I communication known in psychology,
i but of which laymen are still skep-
I tical.
Evidence of Poor Quality
Concerning seances, and the chances
j that we can receive messages from
' another world, Professor Coover said
| that there is no proof yet; there is
j evidence, but it is of poor quality.

ists will claim messages purporting to

ters have failed.
The case of tlie Myers letter was
given as an example. In January, 1891,
F. \V. H. Myers sent a sealed letter
to Sir Oliver Lodge in the hope that
after his death its contents might b®
communicated through some medium.
Lodge placed this letter in a vault in
a bank. Myers died in January of 19(11,
and in February of 1903, references to
the posthumous letter began to ap
pear in the automatic writing of a
certain Mrs. Verrall. During the year
seven or eight more references came
through, successively growing more
definite and insisting that the letter
should be opened for a test of the
verity of her message.
Claim of Influence Disproved
I3v July of 1904 the purported com
municator, Myers himself, stated
clearly in Mrs. Verrall's script that
tlie letter would be found to contain
i a given passage from Plato's "Sympo
; slum," and insisted that the time had
j come for the test. Accordingly, Sir j
j Oliver Lodge called together a num
ber of witnesses, and opened the let- j
tor in the rooms of the Society for |
Psychical Research, on December 13, ]
1904. The Journal of the S.P.R. states
that "it was found that there was no

i fraud, claimed that her seances were |
responsible for the founding of Stan- !

This claim was disproved in a state
ment made by Dr. Jordan, who ;
brought to light the fact that Senator j
Stanford made his will, endowing the j
University, in April of 18S4, and first
met Mrs. Lord-Drake in October of
the same year. So the story that Stan

Evidence of Poor Quality

ters have failed.
The case of tlie Myers letter was
given as an example. In January, 1891,
F. \V. H. Myers sent a sealed letter
to Sir Oliver Lodge in the hope that
after his death its contents might b®
communicated through some medium.
Lodge placed this letter in a vault in
a bank. Myers died in January of 19(11,
and in February of 1903, references to
the posthumous letter began to ap
pear in the automatic writing of a
certain Mrs. Verrall. During the year
seven or eight more references came
through, successively growing more
definite and insisting that the letter
should be opened for a test of the
verity of her message.
Claim of Influence Disproved
I3v July of 1904 the purported com
municator, Myers himself, stated
clearly in Mrs. Verrall's script that
tlie letter would be found to contain
i a given passage from Plato's "Sympo
; slum," and insisted that the time had
j come for the test. Accordingly, Sir j
j Oliver Lodge called together a num
ber of witnesses, and opened the let- j
tor in the rooms of the Society for |
Psychical Research, on December 13, ]
1904. The Journal of the S.P.R. states
that "it was found that there was no
resemblance between its actual con
tents and what Was alleged by the
script to be contained in it.
One of the well-known mediums,
Mrs. Maude Lord-Drake, conducted
seances for Senator and Mrs. Stan- i
ford, who hoped to receive a message
from Leland Stanford, Junior. Mrs. 1
j Drake, who was later detected in!
i fraud, claimed that her seances were |
responsible for the founding of Stan- !
j ford University.
This claim was disproved in a state
ment made by Dr. Jordan, who ;
brought to light the fact that Senator j
Stanford made his will, endowing the j
University, in April of 18S4, and first
met Mrs. Lord-Drake in October of
the same year. So the story that Stan
ford is a Camelot, founded under the
| influence of spirits, is far from being
I a true one.
Are there really spooks?
Professor J. K. Coover of the Psych
ology department lias photographs
taken here at Stanford, showing
white-robed individuals with transpar
ent qualities such as enable chairs,
walls, and other parts of scenery to
show through the person of the afore
mentioned "spook." Although one is
inclined to doubt the authenticity of
these ghostly individuals, many of
whom have names which may have
been in the Student Directory at one
time, there are people who are con
verted to a belief in such things on
similar evidence, according to Profes
sor Coover.
Professor Coover's research is the
result of the interest that Thomas
Welton Stanford, brother of Senator
Stanford, took in spiritualism. Mr.
Stanford, on his way around the
world, found himself to be such a
poor sailor that he concluded his
journey at the first stop, Australia,
and resolved never to set forth on the
water again. During the rest, of his
life, which was spent in Australia, he
became interested in the perform
ances of spiritualistic "mediums," and
in 1912 sent a fund to the University
for the study of psychical phenomena.
No Positive Proof of Phenomena
In an interview yesterday, Profes
sor Coover told of his experiments,
from which he has 110 positive proof
of psychical phenomena. "Man was
helpless when he found that the world
was not what it appeared to be," he
said, "and this accounts for the
myths and nature-worship. There are
still mysterious phenomena, but sci
ence is the official agent, for discover
ing and explaining them."
lie went on to explain that the ele
ments of our knowledge are due to
our "five; senses" and more special
senses, but that every now and then a
fact enters our minds separately with
out being connected with sight, smell,
taste, touch, hearing, or any other
> | sense. This is generally attributed to
'intuition, or a "sixth sense," in the
Menu of the layman, "Intuition may
