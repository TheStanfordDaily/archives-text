# METEOR SHOWERS MAYBE OBSCURED BY MOONLIGHT
## 
### 
Amateur astronomers who are plan- i
! niiik to stay awake until past mid- ;
night in order to view the meteor
shower from the constellation Perseus,
j which is expected about Monday night,
[are likely to he disappointed, accord
ing to Sidney I). Townley, professor
of astronomy.
Anyone consulting the almanac will
discover that bright moonlight is
scheduled for the early morning hours
from August 11 to 13, when the
shower is expected to he at its best.
In speaking of the coming meteor ;
display, Professor Townley remarked '
that an undue amount of publicity is !
often given to this event. "There are
several of these meteor swarms en- 'â– 
I countered by the earth each year,"'he
said, "so that the event is not so
I unusual after all. On some occasions
! the display is much more brilliant
I than at other times, but there is no
| way to determine how thick the
; shower will be."
I Townley pointed out that in 18:11}

I and 18fiG the earth encountered a
I swarm so dense that thousands of !
| meteors wore seen in a single night. |
j "The only astronomical importance of j
| these visitors from outer space, how- !
; ever, lies' in the fact that in the !
i course of many years they add slight- |
l.v to the mass of the earth," he said.
The present theory about the origin
of meteors holds that they are left- !
j over matter of burned-out comets, i
I since meteor showers are encountered
in the orbits of these former comets. ;
Professor Townley also explained j
that meteors are named for the con- |
j stellation In the part of the sky where !
I the shower seems to descend upon ]
| the earth. Thus, those iu the shower j
i from August 11 to 13 which come !
I
from Perseus are called perseids.
Oswald Thomas, the astronomer, j
estimates that the orbit of the per- j
j seids extends out ward about three i
j billion miles from the sun. They
'seem to travel in an endless stream
To miles in width.
