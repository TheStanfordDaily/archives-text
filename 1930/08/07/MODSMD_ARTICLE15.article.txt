# MI. HAMILTON TO BE GOAL OF TRIP
## 
### 
A trip up Mt. Hamilton to the Lick
Observatory, under the auspices of
! the Fortune Yellow Cab Company, is
! being planned for Saturday. The party
| will leave from in front of the Union
at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and re
turn in the evening.
The excursion will go through the
Santa Clara Valley, via San Jose, to
the observatory. On a clear day a fine
view of San Francisco Bay and the
ocean can be had from the mountain.
Lick Observatory, which is oper
ated by the University of California,
was the gift of James Lick to "the
people of California and the world."
j The observatory is really a monu
ment to Lick, who died in 187U, for he
is buried beneath it. There is a
branch of the Lick Observatory in
Chile.
Among the instruments is a large
36-inch refractor of great value. The
party will have an opportunity to
gaze at the stars through this huge
telescope.
The scientists working on Mt. Ham
ilton have formed a colony in which
they live throughout the year. A spe
cial school teacher has been provided
for the children, and all supplies are
sent up by truck.
Members of the trip are advised to
secure a light lunch. The charge of
$3 should be paid to Lois White,
room 347 Roble Hall, or at the guide's
office in front of the Memorial Church.
J. L. Hawley, '24, is in charge of
the tour.
