# ARE TEACHERS PEOPLE?

### 
At a bull session the other night the conversation took a turn to the
subject of school teachers. After the usual flippant jests, the specific
question as to what kind of person made the best teacher was taken up
seriously.
One faction held that the teacher should be the traditional model of
propriety and earnestness; the other that, although the teacher should
certainly be decent, he should be one who brings to the classroom a
colorful personality, lie should have had sufficient experiences to be
more to the students than a dry dispenser of facts.
Unquestionably some peopie who would have made excellent teachers
have been kept out of the profession because of the fear that their
individuality would be stifled. Not many normal human beings like to
be held up as a model.
On the other hand it is just as true that the teacher has a strong
influence upon his pupils and therefore should be one who is worthy of
confidence. The fact that a teacher goes to church regularly might not
influence his charges to attend church regularly. I lilt if a teacher main
tains a cynical or sarcastic attitude toward the beliefs and ideals of the
community, pupils are apt to justify their own attitudes bv the teacher's
example.
There is no obvious reason, however, why a teacher cannot be a com
bination of both types. After all the man who has really lived—known
many of life's varied experiences—is the one best fitted to interpret life
to others. The one whose intellectual interests are narrow, whose emo
tional experiences are shallow, and contacts with other people have been
restricted, can hardly have the attitude necessary to impress the minds of
modern youth.
