# WILL AWAIT RESULTS

President Robert C. Sproul, new president of the University of
California, in his speech to the Commonwealth Club the other day. in
which he presented his educational ideas and something of his hopes and
aspirations, said:
"'As to eliminating the first two years, I should prefer others to make
the experiment. We shall observe the results with interest and be
guided by them."
That seems a sound position for a conservative executive to take;
it avoids the trouble that descends upon the head of a too-rash pioneer
and innovator and still does not close the door to progress completely
and forever if it should be proved that university development does lie
in that direction.
President Sproul's position will be tenable, also, for a considerable
time yet, because obviously the universities cannot fairly drop their first
two years of undergraduate work until those years can be adequately
provided for elsewhere. Hut he proposes to delay this necessary provi
sion through the program which he advocated in the same speech, by
which junior colleges shall be limited to caring for students who cannot
or do not propose to go on to the universities. Ile is certainly not getting
ahead of the lime in his attitude toward the elimination of the first two
years in the universities. In his attitude toward the function of the junior
colleges there is a possibility that he is behind the time.
