# STILL STOCK SUBJECTS
## 
### 
In tlio hook display in the Library the photostat copy of the first
number of tbe Srfit Francisco Medical Journal, 1X56. shows the beginning
of the editorial pages. The "Salutatory" in presenting the need for a
medical journal in this territory, then sufficiently settled and established
to demand such a publication, dwells especially on the prevalence of
medical quackery and undesirable practitioners and bemoans the willing
ness of newspapers to print their advertisements.
The second editorial treats of the California climate and the topo
graphical and other factors which produce it in such admirable quality.
Three-quarters of a century haven't changed things so much that
these items would appear strange or novel in the same journal published
today. There are still men and companies offering to cure all sorts of
medical maladies for the orthodox medical fraternity to inveigh against,
but they are fewer and not so completely unrestrained as they were in
those early davs. Newspaper columns are not open to the mwiih the same
old freedom and no questions asked except ability to pay. although
medical journals can still find some cause for protest, lint the climate
hasn't changed at all : it continues a perfectly good topic for conversation
or editorials.
