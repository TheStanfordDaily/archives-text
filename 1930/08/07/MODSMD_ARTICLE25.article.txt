# WE'LL HAVE THE CELLAR
## 
### 
The announcement thai the Cellar will not he closed in ihe evenings
during the second half of the quarter is cause for congratulations all
round. The management, you may he sure, rejoices that it will he ahle
to maintain this cheerful convenience without conducting it as a charity.
C ertainly, the student hodv will he pleased that a late cup <>l col'tee
or other and cooler refreshments will still he available to help get through
a wearing night of study or less exhausting employment.
The announcement goes out that only simple -comestibles will he
possibleâ€”elaborate architectural sandwiches and complicated dishes can't
be provided. That's all right; that's all right. We can get along on very
simple fare if we have to; what we were atraid of was that we would be
told we couldn't get anything at all.
And we do hope that the Cellar will have enough trade to justify this
attempt to keep it open through the whole quarter for the first time since
summer quarters began here at Stanford. If there isn't enough trade
we do now and here agree that we shall have no kick coming if the place
ha> to be closed.
We honestlv don't think that will be necessary.
