None of the answers to the party- I
of-eight in the desert question that
Thomas A. Edison gave hts specially
chosen quiz section of forty-nine
bright, bright boys seems satisfactory
to us.
Probably we're dumb.
Or maybe too modest.
Because we think we have n better
answer than any of the learned gen
tlemen who gave their solutions to the 1
newspapers.
And we never would think of com
peting with them in a deep-thinking
contest.
But every one of them was satisfied i
with an answer that involved the j
death of three of the six.
That doesn't satisfy us.
Even if we were to be one of the
three saved.
As most of them specified was to !
be part of the solution thnl seemed
best to them.
If you don't remember the terms j
of the conundrum, it is this way.
Lost in a desert with provisions
sufficient for only three to reach
civilization are a brilliant 60-year-old
scientist, two guides aged 58 and 32,
the scientist's wife, :i!», with society j
interests, her (5-year-old son, your best
friend who is a promising young
scientist your own age, your fiancee,
and yourself.
Problem: As head of the parly, who
has to decide, what would you do?
And all the professors who have
answered the question have given
their reasons for saving one or an
other set of three and leaving the rest
to perish miserably.
Our answer: Give the youngest
guide half the food and tell him to
beat it to civilization and send back,
an airplane with lots of thing's to eat.
And make it snappy.
