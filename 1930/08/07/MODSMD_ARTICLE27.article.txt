# SCHOOL TAXES MUST BE REVISED STATES KERSEY AT LUNCHEON
## 
### 
Need for a revision of the present
system of taxation to secure money
for the schools was stressed in a
speech yesterday on <state school
supervision by Vierliiig Kersey, state
superintendent of Public Instruction,
at the weekly luncheon of the Phi
Delta Kappa Educational Fraternity.
"Under the present system we are
receiving money that comes from land
taxation. This is tlie old method that
has continued since the time when
land was the only personal property
to he taxed. If this tax were increased
it; would cause considerable resent
ment in the small communities and
in the industrial districts," said Ker
sey. "1 would propose that an income
tax be assessed in connection with
the land tax. This would take care of
the present situation.
"The question of education has al
ways been paramount with the people
of California. In this state the people
are closer to their schools than in
any other in the Union. There is more
organization and we probably have
the best educational system in the
world."
Another point in the speech was
concerning the problems that arise
in school districts where students are
drawn from two or more communities.
Kersey cited the case of San Gabriel
and Alhambra. "There are enough
people in San Gabriel to vote down
any school bond issue that Alhambra
might need and Alhambra has enough
votes to keep anyone from San Gabriel
getting on the school board. There
are forty-five or forty-seven localities
in the state where such situations
exist, he declared.
Before Kersey's speech. Miss Helen
Cullen, age 3V& years, sang three musi
cal selections: "Painting the Clouds
with Sunshine," "America the Beauti
ful," and "On the Big Rock Candy
Mountain."
