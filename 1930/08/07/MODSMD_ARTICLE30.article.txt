# GREAT VARIETY OF TREES IN STANFORD ARBORETUM
## 
### 
From the scrubby yews of Japan I
and stately deodars of the Himalayas !
to the giant sequoia of the Pacific '
I Coast, nearly every section of t lie i
world has given of its forests to make
ii]t the Stanford Arboretum.
Practically every variety of the !
gymnosperms, which include pines, t
spruces, yews, cedars, firs, and red- j
woods, as well as many other trees ■
j from different parts of the earth, are (
1 found here. There are Nornnuidie firs !
with inverted cones, Santa Lucia firs j
i with long flat branches and fuzzy:
cones, Sierra pines with drooping ;
needles, and many others, in and j
! around the arboretum,
Mt. Atlas Cedars Most Beautiful
1 The quaint maiden hair tree with :
its thick, heavily veined leaves is '
ifound only on the sacred grounds of j
the Chinese temples and tit Stanford, j
Slender cedars of Lebanon and the j
Mt. Atlas cedars, said to be the most
beautiful in the world, both native of |
North Africa and Asia Minor, abound j
j in the Cactus Gardens. The dark pvra- j
j midal outline of firs from Algeria, |

Spain, Japan, Greece, Crimea, and ;
Caucasus, and Western United States, |
can be seen in different parts of the j
Arboretum.
Magnificent redwoods from the».j
mountains of the Pacific Coast are '
scattered over the University grounds. \
The more notable redwoods are the
"Palo Alto" at the railway bridge be- J
tween Palo Alto and Menlo Park, and
several specimens on the campus that j
were planted by famous men, such as j
Theodore Roosevelt and John liay. j
Some Trees Do Not Thrive Here
Specimens of ornamental horticul
ture which are native of distant cor
ners of the earth may be seen. There 1
are camphor trees from Korea, citrus!
trees from Asia Minor, flame tre.es and
eucalyptus from Australia, yuccas and
avocados from Mexico, acacias from
Egypt, dragon palms from the Canary
Islands and the South Seas, and spe
cies of pine, oak, and hemlock from
different parts of the t'nited Stats.
Professor James Ira Wilson Mc-
Murphy of the Botany department
points out that some of the trees do
not thrive in this climate, altitude,
and rainfall. No practical scheme for
irrigating the 1100 acres over which
these trees are scattered has been
worked out. Then, too, bugs and
fungi against which the trees from
other countries are not protected, at
tack them viciously and often retard
their growth, if indeed they do not
actually kill the tree. An excellent il
lustration of this condition of malad
justment is shown by the reaction of
the giant sequoia, which is dwarfed
[and infested with insects in this dry
! lowland, while it thrives at a few
[thousand feet elevation with plenty of
j rain and fog.
This collection of trees, which was
| started by Governor Stanford, has not
I been added to for several years.

Some Trees Do Not Thrive Here
Specimens of ornamental horticul
ture which are native of distant cor
ners of the earth may be seen. There 1
are camphor trees from Korea, citrus!
trees from Asia Minor, flame tre.es and
eucalyptus from Australia, yuccas and
avocados from Mexico, acacias from
Egypt, dragon palms from the Canary
Islands and the South Seas, and spe
cies of pine, oak, and hemlock from
different parts of the t'nited Stats.
Professor James Ira Wilson Mc-
Murphy of the Botany department
points out that some of the trees do
not thrive in this climate, altitude,
and rainfall. No practical scheme for
irrigating the 1100 acres over which
these trees are scattered has been
worked out. Then, too, bugs and
fungi against which the trees from
other countries are not protected, at
tack them viciously and often retard
their growth, if indeed they do not
actually kill the tree. An excellent il
lustration of this condition of malad
justment is shown by the reaction of
the giant sequoia, which is dwarfed
[and infested with insects in this dry
! lowland, while it thrives at a few
[thousand feet elevation with plenty of
j rain and fog.
This collection of trees, which was
| started by Governor Stanford, has not
I been added to for several years.
From the scrubby yews of Japan I

Practically every variety of the !
gymnosperms, which include pines, t
spruces, yews, cedars, firs, and red- j
woods, as well as many other trees ■
