# AFRICA ENSHROUDED IN IGNORANCE SAYS WILLIS IN LECTURE
## 
### 
While Africa lias been the dark spot
in our knowledge of the world, it has
always had a lure for civilized people,
declared Dr. Bailey Willis, who gave
an illustrated lecture in the Little
Theatre Tuesday night on "The Dark
Continent." "It was that lure which
enabled Trader Horn to sell so many
copies of the tale of his youthful in
discretions," he said.
Dr. Willis returned recently from
an expedition through Africa, in which
he traveled 7,000 miles, walking 600
of them. He is professor emeritus of
geology at Stanford and a research
associate of the Carnegie Institution
in Washington.
Has Unlimited Copper Deposits
Professor Willis expressed the be
lief that Africa has a great part to
play in the future of the world. He
displayed pictures of the beautiful Vic
toria Falls, which are higher than
Niagara Falls, and a map of Northern
Rhodesia, which it is claimed has
twenty-seven billion tons of copper in
its deposits.
Despite these natural resources,the
native Negroes of Africa are very
backward. They have never learned
to use a wheel, or even invent sails
for their primitive canoes. They have
never used animals as beasts of bur
den, and although cattle are accumu
lated as a sign of wealth, no utilitarian
use is made of them. There is an
abundance of wild game in Africa,
though contrary to common belief,
there are comparatively few forests.
Vast plains and high plateaus are
much more common.
Economic Forces Against White Man
"Africa's future lies in our hands,"
declared Professor Willis. "However,
economic forces are against the white
man, because of the abundance of un
skilled labor at such low prices." He
then explained the excellent work and
influence of the Englishmen there.
One Englishman sometimes controls
as many as 50,000 natives.
"It .is up to us," he concluded, "to
see that our teaching and administra
tion uplifts, and does not debase, the
Negro."
