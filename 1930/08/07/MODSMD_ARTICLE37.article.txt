# BRADSHAW-HARRIS WIN CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
The undefeated team of Bradsliaw-
Harris became handball champions of
the University yesterday, when they
won the two prize slip-over sweaters
from the team composed of Wilson-
Ska If.
The finals of the tournament were
run off in two straight games with the
victorious combination winning to the
tune of 21-16, 21-16. Although both
teams played on their toes, the supe
riority of Bradshaw-Harris was ap
parent from the start. Many long ral
lies made the set interesting.
