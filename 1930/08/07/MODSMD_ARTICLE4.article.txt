# CELLAR'S SIMPLER SERVICE SUCCESS SAYS MISS HANDY
## 
### 
The simplified service lias proved
successful, according to Ktta Handy,
director of the Union dining rooms
and the Cellar, and there will he 110
further changes this summer.
The omission of the more compli
cated orders in the evening and the
roping off of some of the booths dur
ing the later hours has made the ser
vice; more efficient, and has, by keep
ing people in one part of the cellar,
taken away the feeling of a few cus
tomers being scattered' over a large
and empty room. J. Graham Sullivan
has been transferred from cashier to
a position in charge of the night shift.
Miss Handy added that the decrease
in attendance at the Union has been
less this summer than it has been
other years after the departure of the
first-term students.
