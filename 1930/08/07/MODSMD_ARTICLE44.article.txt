# MORAUD DISCUSSES CRITICS AND DRAMA IN FRENCH LECTURE
## 
### 
"Aii understanding of French classi
cal drama did not come to the British
public until 1822," stated Professor
Marcel Moraud in a lecture yesterday
afternoon in the Little Theatre on
"One Aspect of Literary Relations be
tween France and England during the
French Restoration Period."
"Ii was a great surprise to British
visitors at this time," continued Pro
fessor Moraud, "that the French
classical drama could flourish after
thirty odd years of waj' and political
upheaval. The general professional air
and dignity, the tone of the drama,
the excellent training of the actors,
and the interest with which the
French public followed the more seri
ous drama caused considerable com
ment from outsiders who were prone
to attribute a certain superficiality to
French literary efforts in general."
The speaker pointed out two out
standing critics of this period—John
Scott and Lady Mofgan, both of whom
voiced the traditional prejudices of
British critics of the time against the
French classical drama, its lack of
philosophy, originality, and depth.
Scott, particularly, condemned tlie ab
sence of naturalness in the drama,
while Lady Morgan, whose opinions
were rather biased politically, and
whose knowledge of the French lan
guage was scant, felt that there was
a decided lack of emotional intensity,
and too much adherence to form and
rule.
Professor Moraud concluded with a
brief survey of other channels which
the drama had opened in the literary
field, chief among them being poetry
and the novel. That the <?ignity, re
straint, and nobility of the drama
proved a fertile source of further
creative achievement is beyond a
doubt.
Professor Moraud's third and con
cluding lecture next week will deal
with the English campaign against
French romanticism after 1832, head
ed by the redoubable Thackeray.
