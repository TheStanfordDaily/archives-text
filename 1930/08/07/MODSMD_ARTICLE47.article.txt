# COTTAGES FOR ATOMS! All the Comforts of Home PHYSICISTS SNARE 'EM
## 
### 
Apartment houses for atoms, each
house weighing three tons and being
valued at around two thousand dol
lars, form a colony in the X-ray lab
oratory of the physics department.
Five structures, all built of huge
sheets of lead, were put up by some
of the research workers in physics,
who had to lift the leaden walls into
place themselves.
Each of the five "cottages," which
stand about eight feet high, lias a
little window through which an atom
can peek out and a psysicist can
peek in, and is decorated with a very
complicated construction over the
front door, in order to save the lives
of scientists.
The houses are built of lead be
cause of its high atomic weight,
through which flie dangerous X-rays
cannot penetrate and are therefore
kept from wandering around the
laboratory. The front door appliance,
which resembles a Rube Goldberg in
vention to dust the piano by means
of releasing the canary from his cage
and dropping a goldfish down the radio
loud-speaker, is really an invention
which turns off the high voltage. As
much as 200,000 volts are carried by
wires into these houses, and since
only 6,000 volts are used to electro
cute criminals, the physicists perforce
invented a means of turning off the
current before entering the lead
houses.
