"Hiding backwards through the
jungle for three days at the rate of
| twenty-three miles a day with my
1 feet swinging from a two-wheel ox
I cart."
This was the answer given a re
porter who asked Miss Bertha Rother
mel, graduate student at Stanford
this summer, how she completed the
last stage of her journey from the
railroad to the Teluga Mission in cen-
S tral India where she was a nurse from
! 1909 to .1912.
"At night we stopped in one-room
brick buildings which have been
erected by the British about every
twenty miles along the road," said
I Miss Rothermel. "Those who got
I there first took tlie room. The rest
1 slept on the porch, one side of which
j is reserved for natives and one side
| for whites."
Miss Rothermel has frequently
| made the journey through the jungle
| alone with an old mission servant.
I He used to sleep across the door of
I her room because there were robbers
|as well as snakes and scorpions to
be feared by travelers.
Tigers Occasional Visitors
Tigers are occasional visitors. But
! no.tiger can be shot, Miss Rothermel
I explained, because His Highness
j Nizam, the Mohammedan ruler of the
I dynasty, likes to hunt them on ele
! phant-back. When the hunting party
! comes to a cave, a slave gets down
i and puts a bomb off at the mouth of
I the cave to scare the tiger out. His
| Highness, safely above on the ele
j phant's back, has a shot at the tiger,
j If he misses, the slave is out of luck,
j As "gossip from India," there-
I porter learned that His Highness the
Nizam had 400 wives, children by
every wife, and a maid for every child.
"When he died," Miss Rothermel said,
"the son he had appointed his heir
decided to live like the English with
out 1 wife. However, the officials of
the kingdom, wishing to gain favor
with their new ruler, each presented
him with a daughter, so that in less
than three months he had over two
hundred wives."
Missionaries to Outcasts
A British fort with a moat and
drawbridge stands near the capital
city where tin* Mizam lives. British
soldiers are "warned that if they go
'nto the capital "their bodies will not
come out." And it is understood that
if there is any uprising among the
natives the guns of the fort will he
levelled on the Nizam's palace.
"'Missionaries to the outcasts' was
the name given us," said Miss Rother
mel. "This was because we worked
mostly with the lowest caste Hndus,
'the untouchables.' The untouchables
are supposed To be descended from
the feet of the god Brahama."
Speaking of the book "Mother
India," Miss Rothermel said: "I have
had experiences corroborating many
of the conditions described; they are
lamentably true.
"The Hindus would be in a terrible
plight if the British left India," Miss
Rothermel concluded. "Tlyy would be
oppressed by the Mohammedans, who
are fewer Tn number but far stronger
as a nationality than the Hindus."

Missionaries to Outcasts
A British fort with a moat and

soldiers are "warned that if they go

if there is any uprising among the
natives the guns of the fort will he
levelled on the Nizam's palace.
