# NEW PROPELLER TO GET SECOND TEST ON MILLS FIELD PLANE
## 
### 
"Whether the new paddle wheel
propeller which was tried out on a
plane at Mills Field last week-end is
practical will be determined by its
adaptation in form, weight, and dura
bility to present-day aviation needs,"
said Dr. William F. Durand, professor
| emeritus of mechanical engineering,
and a member of the National Ad
j visory .Committee for Aeronautics.
"The new propeller, which looks
like the paddle wheel of a river
; steamer, is sound in principle," con
tinued Dr. Durand. "There is no criti
cism of it.from an aero-dynamic stand
point. This type of propeller has been
tried out on water more than in the
air, and is less adapted to airplanes
than to ships. It is considerably more
complicated than the regulation pro
peller, but is a good deal more effi
cient."
On the test flight last week the
{plane was not able to rise from the
ground. Several improvements, how
ever, are being made, and a second
I test will be given sometime this week.
Several different aeronautic engi
j neers have been interested in the pad
dle propeller, according to Dr. Durand,
! who saw one such propeller in San
I Francisco five or six years ago.
