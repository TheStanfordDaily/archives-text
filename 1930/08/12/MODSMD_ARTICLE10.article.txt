Chaparral and graduate of the class
of *24, to a sympathetic reporter in
answer lo I lie query, "What are your
reactions, if any, to the Stanford
campus as you find it today?"
Ttye executive assistant to the
Secretary of the Interior shook liis
head sadly as he mused upon the
glories of former days and their sub
sequent decadence.
"In the first place," he confided,
"Ilie men no longer possess that rug
ged manliness so characteristic of
Stanford men of yore. We thought
nothing, then, •of scores like 42-7,
28-0, and 38-0, no matter in whose

27-1H sends the local boys into Testa

Dippy Goes Highbrow
"And the women; ah, the women!"
Here the speaker, overcome, drew
out his handkerchief. "Our women
were healthy, buxom, and hard-boiled.
Did they complain of the draffs in
the gymnasium through the wood
pecker holes? They did not! And
what do I find here now? A new
building in which to nurture the, frail
daughters of Eve. Even the Board of
Athletic Control new has n building
when formerly they were lucky to
find shelter under a circus tent.

! "But this is not all," went on Ely,
grimly, determined to keep his voice

' This disillusioned lawyer observed
•in passing that perhaps one of the

this summer is an unhealthy em
phasis on scholarship, one out of
seven women being admitted to the
University while only one out of four
j men are privileged to attend.
Won't Enlighten Boys Back East
"Yes. There is a way out," ad
mitted Ely when asked if remedial
measures were possible. "There is
! just a chance that powerful alumni
i could be induced to return and lend
a proper recuperative tone to the
I campus, if the University were will
I ing ti» pitch tents for us, serve our
j breakfasts in bed, and provide golf

' while."
The defunct editor of the Stanford
humorous magazine paused, sighed,

care-worn face. "I'm not going to tell
the hoys back East how things are
j out here," he said. "They're happier
jwitli their illusions. Let them remain
content in the belief that California
is still able to paste the stuffings out
