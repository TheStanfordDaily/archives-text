# Professors Ride Unusual Hobbies; Cabins, Looms, Engage Teachers

What does the professor do on his
day off?
Some professors play golf, some
read the funny papers, and some do
absent-minded things, one is led to
believe. At Stanford, some of them
have unusual hobbies, such as weav
ing, looking for optical illustions, or
building log cabins.
A log cabin near La Honda, built
with logs hewn with an axe similar
to the Cardinal trophy and designed
by the owner, is shown in a picture
hanging over the desk of Professor
W. B. Owens in the Daw school. Pro
fessor Owens planned this cabin him
self and built part of it. Until re
cently, he had to carry water to it,
bill he has now piped water up the
hill, and this summer he has wired
his week-end retreat so that he may
enjoy the modern convenience of
electricity 011 his vacations. The
building of the cabine was done by
a friend of Professor Owens who
was an expert with the broad axe.
Since the house was built, Professor
Owens lias made a hobby of adding
railings, building more additions, and
generally improving his domicile.
Another constructive pastime is en
joyed by Dr. Harry Clark, research
worker in biophysics. Some time ago
Dr. Clark became interested in weav
ing, and purchased a hand loom. He
says that a person, working sledaily
for a day, can weave about one yard
of cloth. He has just finished making
a, miniature loom for his five-year-old
daughter. Before lie became inter
ested in weaving, Dr. Clark made
several pieces of pottery, of which
samples can be seen on his desk in
the Physics department.
The patterns of the tapestries
which Dr. and Mrs. Clark have woven
are greatly admired, and are distinct

to the ordinary observer. However,
Professor Walter R. Miles of the
Psychology department might see
things in them that other people
would never expect to see.
Professor Miles claims as his hobby
optical illusions. On entering his of
fice, one first notices the innumerable
pictures on the walls, and then, on
closer study, finds that several are
not what they appear to be. A bunch
of spirals which really aren't spirals
at all, but, are concentric circles with
shading to give the illusion of spirals,
is only one of the tricky ornaments
in his office. Other similar illusions
make pictures of men seem bow
legged or knock-kneed, when as a
matter of fact the legs are straight.
"Optical illusions are as beautiful
as flowers and as interesting to col
lect," said Professor Miles. He sees
things that the casual observer often
does not, in the movies, in electric
light advertising signs, in furniture,
and in architecture.
"A table top may give the illusion
of being warped when the grain of
the wood is exposed at the end, show
ing wavy lines," he said, adding that
in such cases one would prove it
to himself that it was flat only by
placing a fiat object on the top of
the table.
Professor Miles has published
papers on this subject, telling of the
experiences we all have had, such
as looking out of a train window and
watching an object revolve as we
follow it with our eyes.
Professor Binkley of the Depart
ment of History asserted that lie had
no hobby, but would appreciate sug
gestions. Other social science profes
sors were found to be interested in
"just people," one in music, and
several had no hobbies at all.
