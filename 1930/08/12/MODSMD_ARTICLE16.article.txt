# MORAUD TO DISCUSS FRENCH ROMANTICISM IN TALK TOMORROW
## 
### 
"French Romanticism in England"
will be the. subject of Professor Mar
cel Moraud's lecture ;it 4:15 tomorrow
in (lie Little Theatre.
"The first French novel's and
dramas were introduced in England
about 1830," says Morautl. "It was
possible to find the novels in most
of the libraries, and (lie dramas of
Victor lingo and Dumas were ex
tremely popular in the theatres."
This favorable . acceptance lasted
only until 1832 when the political
policies of the Liberal Party would
allow no more French Literature to
enter England, and Ihe British critics
began a campaign against the French
novels and dramas then in England.
This situation was created entirely
by political prejudice and not because
of the character of the works. Critics
said the plays were immoral and were
no! til for the Hrit.ish audiences.
Works of Halzac and (ieorge Sand
were criticized in this manner. Condi
tions of this sort existed until 1838.
"It was not until IS4I that the
French drama and novels became
firmly entrenched in England again.
There has been no serious strife since
that time," JVloraud concluded.
