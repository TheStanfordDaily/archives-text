Wherever men gather, especially men teachers, the argument is
certain to start sooner or later. Should the married woman work? Well,
ir all seems to depend 011 whose wife you are referring to It is rather
surprising how a man's opinion 011 the subject may be radically altered
when his own wife goes to work. What, however, is the effect of her
work on the general economic situation? Are the wages of the entire
industry lowered because the married woman is not only aide to but
frequently does work lor less than a man.' Mere are questions that seem
to be making enemies out of the best of friends and there appears to
be no satisfactory solution in sight.
Of course, much of the argument is based on the old question of
woman's proper place in the scheme of things. Can she manage a home
and a business at the same time? Strange to say. we had thought that
that question had been settled many years ago bv the women themselves.
Jt appears, however, that despite the fact that women have become
numrous in practically all industries, the men have not given up hope
that they will return to their former state of semi-slavery. .Most men
do indeed seem to realize that it is a vain hope and the die-hards are
making their last stand a bitterly 1 ought efiort to keep the married
woman 111 the home. Reformers hold up their hands in horror, and most
men are reformers at heart, and point to the steadilv decreasing birth rate
as an evidence ot race suicide directlv attributable to the great number
of working married women.
The economic question naturally carries more weight. There is little
doubt that often the married woman will take a smaller salary than a
man with a family to support could afford to accept. \\ hether this acluallv
lowers the whole wage scale or merely forces the family man to enter
some other field where the competition with women can not be as great
i> a moot question.
In teaching, many states have attempted to solve/he problem by
prohibiting the employment of any married woman in the public schools.
I here are times when such a law proves to be harsh and unjust. For
instance when two young people who are just starting 011 their careers
wish to marry it often happens that'they could not possibly live on only
the man's salary. Society would probably be benefited if both continued
to work until the man had advanced sufficiently so that the wife could
quit without any hardship.
.Many women claim that the real reason of all the disturbance 011 the
part of the men is that they are afraid that the superior ability of the
women will cause them to lie displaced. Perhaps there is a grain of
truth in this: many people firmly believe that women are inherently better
qualified as teachers than men. Maybe there is onlv one true solution for
the problem. Let the women have the teaching positions and let the men
take up some productive vocation like bootlegging.
