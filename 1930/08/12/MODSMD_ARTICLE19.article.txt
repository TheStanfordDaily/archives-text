# THE 						WOE OF OLD DR. ELY
## 
### 
"Mike klv, old-timers tell us. was a considerable figure in his dav
nt Stanford. Ile was editor <>l ( hapunal and as such produced .'i maga
zine that was officially judged the best in the country. Then he took up
studying and before he got through Stanford had labeled him doctor—
juris doctor—which is not always an indication of aptitude for humor.
And so old Doctor klv, back on the campus as executive assistant to
the Secretary of the Interior—for Ray kyman W ilbur. '96, knows a
go'od Stanford man when he sees him—makes sounds that reverberate
among the arches exactly like the wails of all tvpical old grads.
I hings are changed—different. So many of the dear old incon
veniences and inadequacies have been superseded by unfamiliar improve
ments that it breaks the old man's heart.
'1 he part of old Dr. Ely's education at Stanford that lay in his train
ing as a funny man seems to stand my him. It has helped him to keep his
sense of humor and to see how funny a man is when lie bitterlv bewails
improvements in the old college he says he loves.
