Corn-on the cnli season is witli ns again, but < alifomians know
nothing of the gustatory delights of real suwcl cob corn. The common,
garden variety here has the consistency of a red rubber eraser.
I he middle western epicure tucks bis napkin under his chin, gives
his elbows full play, and indulges his depraved taste with due apprecia
tion, occasionally, to he sure, buttering the end of his nose while in
pursuit of a particularly juicy kernel. When a man loses his upper and
nether bicuspids, his corn-on-the-cob hevday has gone forever, and there
is great wailing and lamentation.
A California!!, on the other hand, will not order cob corn if another
California!! is looking at him. When alone, he will butter the cob
scantily, grasp it gingerly with the finger tips. and. without any of the
elan and dash which constitutes the proper technique (without which
cob corn can not be enjoyed ). merely nibble daintily. There ought t<>
be a law.
