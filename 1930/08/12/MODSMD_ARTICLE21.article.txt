# SPEAKING ABOUT THE WEATHER

What do you think of the weather we are'having this summer?
While it is just a little unkind to make any comparisons at this time,
no doubt many on the campus this summer are glad they didn't attend
summer school in certain other sections of the country. Term papers,
reports, and lengthy reading assignments are likely to he irksome at any
time, but when the mercury in the thermometer hovering around the
KK) degree mark—well. "I'd rather not be bothered about that."
And these nights when the moon comes up above the foothills and
the gentlest of breeze stirs the palm leaves it may be a little difficult to
develop a feverish interest in "principles" and "objectives"—but you
can't help feeling that it is great to be alive.
We're not bragging. We're just congratulating ourselves.
