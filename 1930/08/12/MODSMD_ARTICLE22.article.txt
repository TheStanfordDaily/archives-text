, In the East a campaign has been
started against shows being put on
there.
Possibly no connection, but in San
Francisco Saturday, to advertise a
motion picture they were placing on
business district corners 206-pound
! cakes of ice with lithogriiph sheets of
I the show frozen into them.
No, the title of the film was not
"Frozen Justice."
I
Went, to see the picture.
Nol so bad. But. nothing about ice
| in it. No need of ice, either.
j But the ice blocks certainly helped
solve the unemployment problem for
a time, Amazing how interested peo
i pie were to watch the ice melt alowly
under the hot sun and run off into
the sewer. Pee wee golf courses in the
far outlying districts must have been
deserted while hundreds gazed spell
bound as the life-blood of a cake
trickled into the gutter.
Good practical idea for hot weather.
Just have yourself congealed into a
, large ice-cake and scoff at the heat.
i Might even charge a small admis
sion fee to the curious.
i
In San Francisco. Aren't any ho
courious as all that down here.
Note in "College Humor" that the
president of the Campbell Soup Com
pany is an S.A.F. Which leaves that
summer table with no excuse what
ever.
