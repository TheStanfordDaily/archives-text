# MEMORY IMPORTANT TO PROGRESS STATES REVEREND LEARNED

"Memory is the greatest word of
progress," said 'the Reverend Leslie
Learned, of Pasadena, in his sermon
Sunday in the Memorial Church. "On
it rests the basis of education. The
student is taught many tilings in
! hope that he will remember what he
has been taught and use that knowl
! edge when lie lias need of it."
Dr. Learned divided the realm of
memory into three classes: the mem
ory of scientific fact, the memory of
i history, and the memory, of literature
' and biography. From science one
learns to know the external world.
From history one learns of the lives
of the great men who have lived and
died and created the world in which
we dwell.
"VVe remember Caesar and Napo
leon, Aristotle and Plato, Hegel and
Kant," said Dr. Learned, "and from
: them we learn. From the past we
must interpret the future. The leaden
lof men must remember the lessons
! of history to be wise and great.
"It is, however, in biography and
literature that we learn our greatest
lessons. Poetry comes closest to ihe
mystical in nature. We must realize
that there is something more than
the external and the animal. The
I greatest, need of modern religion is a
great faith, born through there ilms
|of our memory of religious history
land religious men. Beside the exter
nal knowledge that boils and seethes
1 in our caldron of memory stands the
figure of Jesus Christ, greater even
than Mohammed or Buddha. He
taught in order that 'Ye may remem
ber' and use that knowledge when
| there is need of it.
"We need the companionship of
, Jesus," Dr. Learned concluded. "In
I science and history one touches only
the external. In the companionship of
Christ one touches the infinite."
The service was supplemented by
the University Choir, and by Miss
Verda Hogan, who sang a soprano
1 solo.
