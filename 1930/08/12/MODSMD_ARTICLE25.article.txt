## 
### 
Night football, according to Claude
' E. Thornhill, will not be played at
Stanford in the near future. "It will
'be several years, if then," lie told
the Daily yesterday, "before Stanford
i installs lights for it.
"So far I have seen only one night
game. It was played at Los Angeles
between Occidental College and the
University of New Mexico. This game
was well played and easy to follow,
as a white ball was used and the
lights were arranged so they did not
cast many shadows.
Expense Would Be Enormous
"Even if lights make good playing
I possible the expense of equipping a
field is enormous. So far the games
here have drawn large crowds and
there is no need of resorting to night
games. A few lights may be installed
on the practice field ' in order to
lengthen the afternoon practice ses
sions during the latter part of the
fall when the early darkness sliort
! ens the available time. The few
lights necessary for this improve
ment would cost four or five thou
; sand dollars."
Several years ago Drake Univer
sity began playing night football and
(he idea is being copied all over the
country. The British-American track
games in Chicago August 27 will be

leagues in many places since.

i "At present there is no indication
j that our so-called major football
I games will be played at any time
hut in the afternoon," Thornhill said.
"Just now there is no reason for it.
However, should football tend to
lose any of its popularity it would
not be surprising to see night Karnes
follow in short order.
"Under this modern system of Hood
lights the game can be played with
just as much enjoyment to the play
ers and spectators in the evening as
the afternoon. Nevertheless, most
people prefer afternoon games, rather
than waiting for the cool of the eve
ning."
