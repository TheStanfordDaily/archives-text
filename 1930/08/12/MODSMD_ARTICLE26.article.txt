# ROUND TABLES BEGIN AT RELATIONS MEET
## 
### 
Ten Round Tables, which are to
be the feature of the Sixth Institute
!of International Relations which is
being held at the University of Cali
fornia this week, began real work
yesterday morning, according to Pro
fessor R. H. Lutz, of the History dei
partment, who attended the Institute
as a Stanford delegate at its opening
session Friday night. "Many Stanford
! graduate stilfients, as well as visiting
and regular Stanford professors, are '
!in attendance," said Professor Lutz.
Professor Rudolf Holsti, visiting !
professor of international relations at
. Stanford, an<? Professor IS. IS. Robin
j son ol' the History department, are
to lecture at the Institute tomorrow.
This session of the Institute is
especially interesting to Californians,
as the theme of the session is "Eco* i
nomic Bases of International Under
standing in the Pacific Area." The
topic is in direct contrast to the sub
jects of the Williamstown Institute
of Politics, which are principally ;
concerned with international relations
in the Atlantic.
