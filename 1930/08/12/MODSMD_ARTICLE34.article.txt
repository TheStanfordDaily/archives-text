# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA FLAYS TSCHAIKOWSKY AT SUNDAY CONCERT
## 
### 
Combining tlie qualities of musician
and dramatist Willem van Hoogstraten
opened the symphony concert Sunday
in the Woodland Theatre with a mas
terful interpretation of Tschaikow
sky's Symphony "Pathetique." Through
the 'medium of his conducting lie
seemed to dramatize each mood of
the symphony.
There is no available clue regard
inn the program that was in the
composer's mind for this composi
tion. In a letter to iiis nephew, to
whom the work is dedicated, Tschal
kowsky refers to a new symphony
which should be a riddle to every
one.
To some, however, (his composition
is ;i poignant document, portraying
with vivid utterance the immutable
strivings of human existence. After
a great climax in the third move
ment, the symphony concludes with

the Finale, Adagio lamentoso which
sings the swan song of life.
Delicate Descriptive Music Played
Following bis remarkable presenta
tion of the symphony, van Hoog
straten opened the second half of the
program with the delicate descriptive
Overture from the music to Shake
speare's "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," which Mendelssohn com
posed when only eighteen years of
age.
The orchestra presentation of this
composition was especially well done.
There was an ethereal quality about
the high passages for strings which
is rarely achieved even after long
praet ice.
Bach's well-known Air from the D
major Suite was the next number
played by the orchestra. Although
this composition is more familiar as
a (! string solo for violin, it was
originally written as the second
movement of the third orchestral
suite.
Madrid Symphony Conductor Next
At the closing selection van Hoog
straten conducted three excerpts
from the "Damnation of Faust" by
Berlioz. These included three pic
torial compositions portraying epi
sodes in ,the life of Faust. "Menuet.
des l-'olets" is participated in by the
evil spirits, summoned by Mephis
topheles, who appear and surround
Marguerite's home. The "Ballet des
Sylphes" is a fanciful interpretation
which tills the mind of Faust during
a dream. Concluding the program the
orchestra played the brilliant Rakoczy
March, which was originally dedi
cated to the Count Rakoczy.
Next Sunday's concert will be tin
der the direction of E. Fernandez
Arbos of the Madrid Symphony Orch
estra in Spain. The program will in
clude two of the conductor's own

WILLEM VAN HOOGSTRATEN
Combining tlie qualities of musician
and dramatist Willem van Hoogstraten
opened the symphony concert Sunday
in the Woodland Theatre with a mas
terful interpretation of Tschaikow
sky's Symphony "Pathetique." Through
the 'medium of his conducting lie
seemed to dramatize each mood of
the symphony.
There is no available clue regard
inn the program that was in the
composer's mind for this composi
tion. In a letter to iiis nephew, to
whom the work is dedicated, Tschal
kowsky refers to a new symphony
which should be a riddle to every
one.
To some, however, (his composition
is ;i poignant document, portraying
with vivid utterance the immutable
strivings of human existence. After
a great climax in the third move
ment, the symphony concludes with

the Finale, Adagio lamentoso which
sings the swan song of life.
Delicate Descriptive Music Played
Following bis remarkable presenta
tion of the symphony, van Hoog
straten opened the second half of the
program with the delicate descriptive
Overture from the music to Shake
speare's "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," which Mendelssohn com
posed when only eighteen years of
age.
The orchestra presentation of this
composition was especially well done.
There was an ethereal quality about
the high passages for strings which
is rarely achieved even after long
praet ice.
Bach's well-known Air from the D
major Suite was the next number
played by the orchestra. Although
this composition is more familiar as
a (! string solo for violin, it was
originally written as the second
movement of the third orchestral
suite.
Madrid Symphony Conductor Next
At the closing selection van Hoog
straten conducted three excerpts
from the "Damnation of Faust" by
Berlioz. These included three pic
torial compositions portraying epi
sodes in ,the life of Faust. "Menuet.
des l-'olets" is participated in by the
evil spirits, summoned by Mephis
topheles, who appear and surround
Marguerite's home. The "Ballet des
Sylphes" is a fanciful interpretation
which tills the mind of Faust during
a dream. Concluding the program the
orchestra played the brilliant Rakoczy
March, which was originally dedi
cated to the Count Rakoczy.
Next Sunday's concert will be tin
der the direction of E. Fernandez
Arbos of the Madrid Symphony Orch
estra in Spain. The program will in
