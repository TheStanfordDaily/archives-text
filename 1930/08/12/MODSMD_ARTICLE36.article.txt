# MODERN ESSAY GROWING IN POPULARITY, SAYS RUSSELL
## 
### 
That the modern essay is the |
i fastest growing type of present-day
literature is the opinion of Mrs.
) Frances Theresa Russell, associate
professor of English, She believes
the old idea that an essay is a
"dry thing written by Emerson" is
being rapidly *ff?splaced by ivcogni
| tion of its charm and readability.
"It is an encouraging sign when
we notice that in the past two years
more than sixty volumes of antholo
( gies have been published," said Miss
Russell to a reporter. "This mean;
i that tiie public is responding to the '
appeal of the # essay, and that appeal,
though interesting in itself, is pri
marily intellectual. We can attribute
much of the popularity of the essay i
to the fact that as the short story,
poetry, and the one-act play, it is
brief and to the point.
"Another reason for tiie popularity j
of tiiis form of literature is that it
I covers a wide range of interests, j
Titles range from 'Eating Cheese'J

lo 'Speculation cm the Universe.' The
freedom of style that the essay al- |
lows is responsible for it being the
mouthpiece of non-professional as .
well as professional literary men.
The scientist, clergyman, college pro-,
lessor, and doctor have all contri
buted to the present flood of essays. J
"The journalistic product of the I
column writer is one of the divisions (
into which the modern essay falls.
Simeon Stiunsky, lies wood Broun,
Robert Benehley, Christopher Morley,
and Don Marquis, are all well-known |
essayists. The work of tin-* editor and
the literary critic can in many cases
be classified as essay-writing. Maga
zine articles of the better type are i
also essays.
"Among the most popular English
essavists we find those who are well- I
I
known in other lines of endeavor. |
Galsworthy, Ramsa\ McDonald, A. A.
Milne, Stephen Leacock, G. -K. ("lies- !
terton, and Alfred Noyes are the I
most famous of these men."
