# NORMAL ADULT LOSES ONE POUND WHILE SLEEPING
## 
### 
A pound is lost during the night's
sleep of the normal adult, according
to Dr. Walter R. Miles, professor of
j psychology.
The moisture in the breath, and
I that which is excreted from the pores
! of the skin, evaporates. Such loss is
j called the "insensible loss," and is
directly related to basal metabolism.
The experiment establishing this fact
was conducted by Dr. Miles and bis
assistant, Arthur Orner. It entailed
the placing of a subject on a chair
! suspended on one end of a large
weighing balance, while the other end
I was counter-balanced with weights
| varying in size from fifty pounds to
j two grams. A stop-watch was set, and
as the subject lost weight and rose
into the air, he was balanced by the
j removing of the two-gram pieces from
I the other side of the fulcrum.
One of these small weights was re
moved every one and one-half to five
; minutes, when the normal adult was

' being tested. Ii was concluded tlull
the human body loses about forty
grams an hour while it is immobile.
Further tests are now being made to
establish the correlation between
other conditions of living, and high or
low rates of loss. ».
This experiment and its form is not
new, but was performed by Sane
torius in Hi 14.
Dr. Miles is performing other ex
j periments to determine the results
Jof metabolic functioning. One of the
most spectacular of these is the re
cording of the rate of use of oxygen
under varying conditions. This in
volves the wearing of a gas mask by
the subject.
Should anyone with an abnormal
pulse rate (below <»<> per minute, or
above 80 per minute) wish to know
the personal record of his basic meta
bolism. he should report to Dr. Miles
in the Psychology building before
September 1.
