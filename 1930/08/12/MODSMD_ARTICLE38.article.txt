# LAGUNITA SCENE OF TRAGEDY FOLLOWING PALO ALTO ROBBERY
## 
### 
The body of a man, later identified
as that of Robert E. Riley, 22, was
found Friday morning in a sedan run
up on the north side of Lagunita.
Bullet holes in the head and a re
volver lying beside the corpse were
taken by Fred Frehe and George
Burns, campus officers, as indications
that Riley had shot himself, following
the holdup of a Palo Alto garage the
night before. The garage man who
was robbed declared the dead man
was the same as the one who took
$31.65 from him at the point of a
revolver. In the pockets of the dead
man was something more than
dollars.
Riley was formerly a San Mateo
boy. The automobile had evidently
been stolen and the license plates
changed.
