# COSMIC RAYS TO BE INVESTIGATED FROM BALLOON IN BAVARIA
## 
### 
"Raritibd atmosphere and extreme
colli will be tlit? most serious diffi
culties encountered in the ascension
of Professor Piccard and his associ
ates when they attempt to ascend
ten miles to study the cosmic ray,"
stated Professor Edward P. Condon
of the Physics department, visiting
professor from the I mversity of
M innesola.
Professor Piccard of Brussels Pni
versity is building a halloon in wliicli
he hopes to get ten miles above the
earth to slntly the cosmic ray in tliat
extremely rarilied atmosphere. He
will also take recordings of the in
tensity of the ray at different alti
tudes. The ascension will take place
next spring at Augsburg, Bavaria.
Similar studies were made in 1
at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas,
by I»r. Milliken and Dr. Gowen of
the California Institute of Technol
ogy. These men made small balloons
and attached instruments to them
Ilial would record the height, inten
sity of the cosmic rays, and the
temperature. Pour were sent out but
only two were recovered. One of
these had attained a height of fifty
thousand feet and the thermometer
registered sixty degree below zero
on the centigrade scale.
When questioned on the nature of
the cosmic ray Condon said: "It can
be compared with the hard X-ray. It
has been found at the bottom of
lakes and underground. The fact
that it is able to penetrate the at
mosphere that surrounds the earth is
very good proof of its power. So far
we have nothing in the laboratories
with which we could duplicate the
cosmic ray.
"There is no practical use for the
cosmic ray and the interest shown is
purely scientific. However, a use may
he found later as in the case
of the radio waves. When radio
waves were tirst put under supervi
sion it was admitted that; there was
no practical use for them, but now
we have the radio."
