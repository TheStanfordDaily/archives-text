"Susie" 'round the corner" came
into her own again last Friday. Ac
companied by her companions, the
"Tasmanian Crawl" and the "Military
Dive," this toe-twisting splash formed
a side spiiting nucleus for I'ete Des

act which closed the summer swim
ming meet. This-watery comedy, com
pleting an afternoon of aquatic com
petition, was preceded by an exhibi
tion of fancy diving by the two men.
Desjardins, Olympic champion, fea
tured among his dives a one-and-a
half lay out, a full twist, one-and-a
half gaynor, and one and -a half with
a full twist, with Throndsou execut
ing equally well a series of similar
dives.
The meet, sponsored by the Daily
with the aid of the Department of
Physical Education, was under the
direction of Myron Sprague, swim
ming coach. Outstanding among the
events, and also among the upsets,
was the special 150-yard open free
style for varsity and freshman letter
men and other advanced swimmers.
