# MOVEMENT OF CELLS RECORDED BY MOTION PICTURE MACHINES
## 
### 
j Magnifying the motion of cells by
| moving pictures which makes it pos
sible to observe many hours of de
velopment in a few minutes was one
!of the features in an illustrated lec
ture on cell life given in the Bac
teriology building yesterday by War
ren H. Lewis.
| Professor Lewis is from the Johns
! Hopkins University where he is doing
[research work in the Carnegie institu
' tion.
Moving pictures of various types of
cells were shown, including the de
velopment of. the egg cell of a rabbit
and the life history of cancer and
| tumor cells. Some of the films were
■ increased to record a speed of 180
• times greater than that which na
| turallv took place.
"It is possible to get the egg
cells to develop normally by placing
them in a medium of vitrol 'issue.
I In this way it is easy to photograph
the development of the cells through
an ordinary cover glass." Lewis ex
plained.
