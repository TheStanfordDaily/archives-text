# SIMIAN BEHAVIOR MUCH LIKE OURS REPORTS KLUVER
## Monkeys Able to Jump From Five Story Building Without Injury Tests Financed by Behavior Research Fund 
### 
Monkeys who can jump from a tive
! story building without injury and who
I possess super eyesight, need not envy
I their human cousins. These and other
j unusual abilities are described by Pro
lessor Heinrie.h Kluver, visiting pro
| lessor of psychology, as a result ol a
series of experiments financed by the
Behavior Research Fund now being
affiliated with the University of Chi
cago.
"In order to accurately determine
the causes of animal and human be
havior, it, is necessary to attack the
problem from many angles. In 11)2(1
this assumption led public-spirited
citizens of Chicago to establish the
Behavior Research Fund, including
! the departments of psychology, medi
i cine, sociology, and psychiatry," Pro
fessor Kluver explained.
Various Abilities Tested
Examples of the experiments car
ried on by Professor Kluver while in
I the Psychology department include
[testing monkeys for their baility to
determine differences in size, shape,
color, and weight. Results of these
experiments show that these animal.:
j possess the powers of generalization
' and comparison to a marked degree.
When a monkey has learned to
! choose the larger of two rectangles
j in order to secure food, it will con
| tinue to choose the larger rectangle
j as long as the size is increased. In
the same manner, a monkey will al
ways choose the heavier of two or
more weights if it lias been taught to
expect food as a result, even though
the lighter weight may have been the
heavier weight in a previous experi
ment, investigations disclosed.
Part of Brain Removed
"Different species of monkeys re
spond in different ways," Professor
Kluver stated. "For instance, the
! spider monkey will take five or six
j times as long to select the correct
