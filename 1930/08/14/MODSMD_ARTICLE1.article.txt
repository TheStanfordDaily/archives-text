# NEW BAY BRIDGE IS DISCUSSED BY PROFESSOR MARK
## Engineer Believes Success of Venture Primarily Due to Hoover and Young Faculty Member Has Little Sympathy for Officials of Interested Groups 
### 
When the Sail Francisco Bay bridge
is finally built, credit l'or the stupen
dous undertaking must be given pri
marily to President Herbert Hoover
and Governor C. C. Young. This is the
opinion of C. 1). Marx, professor emeri
tus of Civil Engineering at Stanford,
and a member of the Hoover-Young
Bay Bridge Commission.
Manifesting little sympathy for the
officials of the various interested
groups, including the army, the navy,
the municipalities, and nearby locali
ties, who have wasted considerable
time and energy squabbling over the
location, finance, construction, and
traffic outlets of the structure, the
ex-eeutives of the nation and state
calculated as engineers and business
men, according to Marx, and appoint
ed the Commission from representa
tives of the different factions, and
added a number of competent engi
neers.
Vertical Clearance of 220 Feet
"With a vertical clearance of 220
feet in the highest place and 171 feet
at the dock line, a horizontal clear
ance of IGOO feet between Rincon Hill
and Goat Island, and €>00 feet from
that point to the Key System mole in
the Fast Bay, the double-deck span
will not only permit any ship to pass
under it, but will accommodate 16,-
000,000 autos through its six-lane
upper deck within a year, and also
a schedule of trains over the two
track lower deck," Professor Marx
said yesterday.
"Work on this project has been
under way since October !), l'.)2!), at
which time an investigation was con
ducted under the supervision of the
California Department of Public
Works. The reports from this survey,
as well as all other available data,
was employed by the commission to
consider the numerous possibilities,
and reach its complicated decision.
Should Be Completed by 1937
"This decision brings to a close
several years of controversy in the
San Francisco bay region, during
which time many problems have
arisen in tfans-bay traffic, and cries
for a solution have been loud and fre
quent. Numberless proposals have
been submitted that were feasible on
paper hut impossible from a technical
point of view.
"The action of the commission has
settled this question of utmost im
portance and if nothing impedes the
progress of the work, the San Fran
cisco Bay will be spanned before the
end of 1!)i57."
