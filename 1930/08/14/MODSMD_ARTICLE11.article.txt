# Press Of Europe Is Discussed By Holsti
## Internationalism Is Shown in Europe's Newspapers To Great Extent 
### 
Newspapers in Europe are domi
nated by internationalism to a much
greater extent than in America, ac
cording to Professor Rudolf Jlolsti,
visiting professor of political science
from Finland.
"Because America is geographically
more isolated, the newspapers tend to
stress national rather than interna
tional events. There is also much more
sensationalism in American journal
ism," Professor Holsti pointed out.
"In America there has developed a
distinct style in news-writing which
endeavors to present a story in the
fewest possible words. Bold face head
lines attract the eye. The story fol
lows with a summary of the important
events in tlie first sentence.
"The news in European papers,
however, is often written in a really
literary style. The headlines are in
small, inconspicuous type, and the
story is written in a style more like
our editorials and feature stories.
Believes in Schools of Journalism
"In Finland, as in this country, each
newspaper supports a political plat
form. The papers are constantly in
creasing in political influence."
Schools of journalism are destined
to be important factors in bringing
about a better understanding between
nations, Professor Holsti believes.
While as yet there are no Finnish
schools of journalism, this field offers
many possibilities for the student of
world relations, in his opinion.
Unlike American newspapers, those
in Finland and other European coun
tries do not use syndicated news,
Holstl explained. Each paper of any
size has its own news service, which
co-operates with other independent
papers throughout the world. There
is a much greater variety in the way
news is written, as a result. Editorials
are of greater importance.
Leaves For Geneva Conference
Professor llolsti is leaving Stanford
tmorow in order to attend the
League of Nations Conference in
Geneva, September I. He and the Sec
retary to the Finnish Legation, Miss
Liis* Franssila, are making the trip
north to Vancouver and east through
tiie Canadian Rockies to Winnipeg
and Toronto, and from there to New
York. They will sail for Geneva in
about two weeks on the "Isle do
France."
Professor Hoisti expressed his re
gret in having to leave Stanford. "My
stay on this campus lias been most
enjoyable," lie said, "and I wish to
thank everyone for the kindness and
hospitality which they have extended
to me."
