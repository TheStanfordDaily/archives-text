# STANFORD MEN BUILD MIDGET GOLF COURSE AT SEARSVILLE LAKE
## 
### 
Eric Krenz and "Casey" Kazanjian,
prominent Stanford athletes and own
ers of the local Putt Putt miniature
golf course, will open a new course at
Searsville this afternoon. It will be
another one of the chain of eighteen
or twenty that they plan to build dur
ing the next few months in the north
ern part of California.
The course at Searsville is unique
in the fact that it is set in the side
of a hill and is only two hundred
yards from the beach. The walks con
necting the eighteen holes are made
of fine sand, so that barefooted
bathers may enjoy the course. Plenty
of hazards and several tricky holes
will try the skill of the most accom
plished golfers, according to the two
athletes.
Krenz and Kazanjian have plans
nearly completed for the erection of
the largest indoor golf course in north
ern California which will be con
structed in San Francisco. Tracy,
Krenz's home town, and sites near
Stockton and Redwood City have been
selected as the next locations for addi
tional courses.
Kazanjian, who holds the position
of legal adviser, stated that they were
building these courses in the different
towns with the intention of selling
them to local people after they had
been well started. However, the men
will retain a few of the courses for
their own operation to be handled by
local managers.
