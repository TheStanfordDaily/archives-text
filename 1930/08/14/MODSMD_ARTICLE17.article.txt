# NEW BASKETBALL COACH ARRIVES FROM KANSAS U
## John W. Bunn Gives Views On Future Methods of Coaching at Stanford Hoop Mentor Wants Football Men; Fall Practice to Start Early This Year 
### 
"Basketball practice season will
open the first week of the fall quar
ter," announced John W. Dunn, new
varsity basketball coach, who arrived
yesterday from the I'niversity of Kan
sas. The reason for starting the sea
son this early, according to the new
| coach, is because it will give him a
better chance to size up his material
and get things running smoothly be
| fore the games start.
"I hope a large squad of both var
j sity and freshman men will answer
j the first call for players," Bunn re
| marked to the Daily yesterday. "If
j anyone thinks he can play basketball
and will come out the first of the
season, he will be given every oppor
tunity possible toward becoming a
good player."
j In contrast, to most coaches, Bunn,
who hag established an enviable ree-
I ord at Kansas, where for the past
several years he lias been turning out
winning teams, likes to have football
men on his squads. "They are more
rugged physically ami seem to inject
a livelier spirit into the team," lie re
marked. "The football season will end
early enough for the players to re-
I port for practice."
When asked the style of play he
would use here, lie replied that it is
impossible to decide on any definite
plan until lie had an opportunity 1o
size up the different players. As he
explained it, different types of men
require different styles of play. A
short, fast team can not use the slow
breaking defensive system as effec
tively as larger and slower men. The
same is true on defensive play, as
I opposing teams have to be met. with
various forms of play. This makes it
impossible to state definitely the type
we will use. However it will be a
combination of the several styles that
have been successfully used in the
leading midwestern colleges.
Bunn believes that the high scholas-
tic requirements here at Stanford
should tend toward a higher type of
athlete mentally than is found in the
institutions where the outstanding
high-school athletes are invited to at
tend because of their physical abili
ties. Athletes should have the power
to think for themselves on the floor
and not act like so many machines
turned out by a coach.
