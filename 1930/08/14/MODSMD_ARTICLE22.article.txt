# COLLEGE SPIRIT IN THE SUMMER
## 
### 
One of tlic finest experiences of American college life is the feeling
of affection and loyalty that is engendered—the feeling of belonging.
Expressions of love for "dear old alma mater" and exhortations for a
display <>l the proper spirit have become broinidic, yet the fact remains
that that spirit gives college life the quality which makes it peculiarly
fascinating. Without it college would be a drearv place.
I eh typical "summer session" of American colleges verges closelv on
this dreariness. Even here at Stanford, where the summer quarter is
an integral part of the scholastic year and academically on precisely the
same plane as the others, there is a difference. Credits earned during
the summer are as valid as those gained in the "regular" quarters.
Students in the summer quarter are as much a part of the Stanford
student body (Didn't we pay the $13?) as those here any other quarter.
I'ut there is a difference. The dearth of social affairs and extra
curicular activities, the preponderance of graduate students, the absence
of fraternity and sorority enterprises give this part of the year an
academic tone and apparent seriousness that distinguish it from others.
Nevertheless, the student body in the summer is as much imbued
with loyalty to Stanford and as capable of demonstrating the Stanford
spirit as at any other time. Comparatively few of the summer students
are merely transients; most of them are doing graduate work that will
take them three or more summers or they are students continuing work
of earlier quarters. The majority are enough • attached to Stanford
to feel that they are a part of it.
Might there not be, then, more of an attempt to weld the students into
an actual student body. - ' We do not know whose responsibilitv this would
be, whether the administration authorities in charge of the summer
quarter or the officers of the student bod} - who now function actively
for three quarters and then become dormant, but the experiment would
be worth-while for summer students and for Stanford. Any hope of
arousing a "rah-rah" attitude or of developing indifference to studies
would be as impossible as it would be undesirable, but there is opportunity
to develop more genuine college spirit and Stanford spirit.
