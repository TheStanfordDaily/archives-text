# SIMIAN BEHAVIOR OF HUMANS
## 
### 
Professor Kluv.er. who has studied monkeys, declares that their be
havior is a good deal like that of human brings. It certainly is. ()r, to
put it the other way around, human behavior is remarkably like that of
our simian relatives.
"Monkey see monkey do" epitomizes one noticeable characteristic of
the simian. And watch us humans with that in mind! Let our girls cut
off their hair and they must all cut off their hair. Let them cut off their
skirts and they must all cut oil their skirts. If some lengthen their hair
or their skirts, then —maybe with some protests, to be sure—practically
all will follow the mode. Do some men grow beards, then all must;
shave their faces, then that fashion binds the mass of men. Wide brims
on their hats, wide bottoms on their trousers, wide borders on their
handkerchiefs—then it's a wide, wide world for men.
Where we have it on the monkey is that he isn't able to save his face
with language, as we can. and use dignified words like "custom," "tradi
tion." "good form," and so on.
Where the monkey has it on us is that, being unable to laugh at all,
he doesn't laugh at the wrong time. We laugh at customs and habits
that happen to be "out" but as soon as they are "in" again we regard
them with a soberness equalled only by that of the monkey, who has no
mental equipment to tell him how humorous he is. When skirts are
short we giggle about how ridiculous long skirts were, but when skirts
are made long we regard them with simian gravity.
I'roquet arouses our sophisticated risibilities as a delightfully mid-
Victorian absurdity—knocking a ball around over the lawn —can you
imagine anything more inane, by dear! I Jut peewee golf starts in Tennes
see —where they deny family connection with monkeys—and the rest of
us u]) to now have caused an investment of $125,000,000 in this "very
latest" thing that is all the rage.
