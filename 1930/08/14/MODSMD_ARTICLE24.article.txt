Professor Rudolf I lolsti. commenting on American and European
newspapers, mentions the contrasts which strike all intelligent observers.
The American newspaper is more provincial than the European, morV
sensational ( Professor I lolsti politely refrained from saying more super
ficial), more stereotyped in style of writing and in arrangement of head
lines and arrangement of facts in the narartion of events, less literary
and artistic.
All true, lint America need not he wholly ashamed, for there is
something to he said in defense of these very things.
American newspapers are made to he read and are read hy practically
all classes of citizens; that is not so true of Kuropean newspapers. Mere
the papers are published for Tom. Dick, and Marry; there, on the whole,
if thev are better it is because thev are designed for Thomas. Esq., and
Dick and Ilarrv don't have to be taken into account. Our journalism,
that is. is democratic. It will rise as the general level of a democratic
people rises.
