"In a four-dimensional world, it
would be possible to turn a tfiinis ball
. inside nut without cutting it."says
an English scientist in explaining Kin
stein's theory.
Great stuff, professor; tennis balls
wear out too fast anyway.
By the same token, skulls might be
turned inside out. A lot of columnists
1 would have a tough time getting
along.
We always did want to see what
makes them tick, or think tliev tick,
: or think they tickle.
The Daily office is being put under
I the hammer.
i No, not an auction; keep your pen
• nies.
Just a little remodeling.
Sometimes the sound of the type
writers drowns out the pounding of
; the carpenters.
Mostly it's the other way round.
: Sample conversation;
Editor: "Hey, bang, bang, get that
IJANU, blam, bump copy in."
Reporter: "What?"
i Editor: "Get bang, bam, BANG,
BANG, bum]) that copy in."
Reporter: "What?"
Editor: "I say BANG, bang-bang
I get *&?()* $*:!"
Now —if you read all the Daily care
fully—you know what professors do
on their day off.
In so far as a diligent reporter was
, able-to And out.
And in so far as the professors told
the whole truth.
One has no hobby, but would ap
preciate suggestions.
Suggestions—the name need not
necessarily be atached —left at the
Daily office will be transmitted to the
professor.
j
Maybe.
Finals are coming. You ought to be
able to think of some fitting hobby
for a professor.
i Remember, professors are human
beings.
In spite of appearances.
Try to hold fast to that thought,
i It may be hard, but try anyway.
Easier now than when finals have
j begun.
i
And that's strange, too.
For the finals period is really the
trying time of the whole quarter.
