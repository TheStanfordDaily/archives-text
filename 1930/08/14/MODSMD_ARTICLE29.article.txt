# ROMANTIC MOVEMENT IN FRANCE TRACED IN MORAUD LECTURE
## 
### 
"Enthusiasm alone is not sufficient
to comprehend poetry," said Professor
Marcel Moraud in his lecture, "Le
Roman," given in French at the Little
Theatre yesterday afternoon. Profes
sor Moraud traced the development
of the French romantic movement
i during the last century particularly,
and emphasized the sympathy and in
fluence of English critics and the Eng
lish public with this movement.
The Englsh romantic poet, Byron,
influenced French poetry enormously,
as he did all poetry. During his life
English poetry was in advance of
French poetry, Professor Moraud be
] lieves. Later, howeve., Balzac, George
Sand, and Victor Hugo became the
supreme exponents of romanticism,
and exemplified the exultation which
surged up after the political disturb
ances had quieted and the success of
the French Revolution was assured.
"The English lack ot imagination,"
however, gave scant sympathy to
these prose writers, the speaker sug
gested. To French poetry the English
were more hospitable. .
Leigh Hunt alone of the English
critics showed sympathy, justice, and
intelligence. The cynicism of Balzac,
(the romantic "monsters" of Victor
Hugo, and the social problems treated
by George Sand were met with a
storm of bitter protest by the English
public, whose own romantic school,
exemplified by Wordsworth, Maria
Kdgewort.il, and Leigh Hunt, differed
Iso radically from these Freflch
j writers.
Some Englishmen even asserted
that these French romantic writers
were "malade," because their work
i was so intensely exaggerated. "De
spite their faults, however, these
writers portrayed the true Frenchman
and the true French spirit, and Balzac,
especially, produced works of spirit
and genius," Professor Moraud said.
Professor Moraud also explained
the appaivnt paradox that "Thack
eray is of all English writers the most
truly French in spirit." Although
Thackeray was a disciple of realism,
and although lie wrote for the English
conservative class, his appreciation
and sympathy with French teeling
enabled him to approach most nearly
the French attitude, which is usually
I alien to that of the ordinary English
man.
