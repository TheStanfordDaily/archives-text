# IMPROVEMENTS UNDER WAY ON "DELT" HOUSE
## 
### 
j The Delta Tau Delta house, 050 San
j Juan, is being renovated inside and
out. A new roof, new brick steps in
front, new sun-porch, and a new fur
nace are some of the additions. Mem
bers say the new furnace should be
of particular interest to prospective
j pledges. No running downstair ? to
fire up the furnace â€”just push the but
i ton.
Walls, floors, and ceilings are being
cleaned and retinted. The den has
been enlarged and the veranda re
finished. A new system of electric
wiring has been installed throughout
I the building.
