of beneficence at war with evil in the
world, was pluced in the Thoimrs Wei
ton Stanford Art Gallery in 1922 as a i
j permanent memorial for the war work ,
of Herbert Hoover in Belgium.
During the disastrous days of the j
} World War, Herbert Hoover, as Allied
! Food Administrator, endeared himself
J to the hearts of the Belgians by his
thoroughness and efficiency by turn
' ing over the post-war surplus funds
j to their educational institutions. Bel
j gian exiles in London before the Arrnis- !
tit*e started the movement to present
> the statue of Isis, the last work of !
! the great Belgian sculptor, Puttemans, j
1 to Hoover to commemorate his deeds <
for Belgium.
Prominent People at Unveiling
When the Belgian government ap
proached Hoover in regard to the lo- ;
I cation of the memorial, the latter re- '
quested that it be placed on the Stan- !
; ford campus, because so many of the

i sentrftive of his government at the |
