# TOWNLEY DECLARES VESUVIUS NOT CAUSE OF QUAKE IN ITALY
## 
### 
j Neither the volcano Vesuvius nor
'the storm which took place in the
vicinity a few days afterwards hiul
I anything to do with the recent eartli
jquake in Italy, according to Sidney
| Dean Townley, professor of astronomy
and geodesy. "This is contrary to the
opinion of the general public," says
Professor Townley, "which usually
believes that earthquakes are con
nected with volcanic eruptions, cy
clones, etc. It is probable, however,
! that tlie recent earthquake was of the
' type known as tectonic.
"Italy, because of the difference in
i the elevation of the land and the
i depth of the ocean, is subject to
j earthquake shocks, just as are Cali
j fornia and Alaska on the Pacific
j Coast. No official scientific data lias
j been published as yet, so it is impos
! sible to state the fundamental cause
of the earthquake in Italy. The shock,
j however, was a violent one, and seis
mographs all over the world recorded
its vibrations."
The Stanford seismograph, which
is located at the University golf
course, records only local earth
quakes, so no • impression oi the
Italian earthquake was recorded here.
I Professor Townley states that Italy
will probably not have another tem
blor soon, except perhaps the minor
! shocks which usually attend a bin'
: earthquake.
Professor Townley is also editor of
the Bulletin of the Seismological So
ciety of America, which was first pub
lished in 1911.
