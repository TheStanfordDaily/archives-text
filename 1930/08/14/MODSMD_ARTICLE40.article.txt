# CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WORK DISCUSSED BY CLOUD
## 
### 
"The California Teachers' Associa
tion is concerned with three objec
tives. The first, of these is retirement
with a pension, the second is the
question of tenure, the third is a new
form of taxation," said Hoy W. Cloud,
'05, at the Phi Delta Kappa educa
tional luncheon yesterday.
"The tenure question seems to be
Hit; most perplexing of the three," he
continued. "This law provides that
if a teacher lias taught for two years
and is elected for tlie third time he
becomes a permanent member of the
institution in which he is teaching.
Members of the different school
boards think this unwise because some
friction may arise between the voters
and the teachers who by virtue of this
law have become permanent."
Cloud explained that the California
Teachers' Association was first organ
ized in 1863. Membership was very
small and the chief objects of the
association at. that time were to hold
conventions, discuss problems of their
various localities, and to publish a
magazine, "California Teacher." The
association Avas reorganized in 1909,
at a meeting in Fresno. Duncan Mc-
Kinnon, '99, was elected president of
the reorganized association, serving in
that office for two years.
Thit* new body established several
departments. Notable among these are
the legislative department, the legal
advising department, and a loan bu
reau. Cloud, in his capacity of execu
tive secretary, goes to the state legis
lature each year with the forms of
the legislative department and pre
sents them. The legal advising depart
ment keeps the teachers posted on all
the cases pertaining to the schools
and gives legal advice. No other teach
ers' association in the United States
has a department like this one. The
loan bureau was established for those
who find themselves hard pressed
financially and allows them to repay
loans at their convenience.
"New forms of revenue are neces
sitated by the addition of new sub
jects to the curriculum of t lie schools
each year. In some districts state sen
ators have made this a part of their
platforms. As to retirement, we have
hired one of tlie best authorities on
the subject to work out a plan for
us," said Cloud in conclusion.
