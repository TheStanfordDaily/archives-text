# PLAYS PIANO WITH ARM! Local Pianist Goes Modern YOU, TOO, MAY LEARN!

Most people play the piano with
their fingers only; however, Arthur
Hardcastle, local pianist, not only
plays with all of his fingers but, in
order to play the difficult composi
tions of Henry Cowell, "dean of ultra
modern music, finds it necessary to
cover as many as twenty-four keys
with his forearm. In rendering one of
these selections, "Echo of llit' Fairies,"
he plucks the strings.
Hardcastle, himself an ultra-modern
composer, is said to he the only per
son who can play all the compositions
of Henry Cowell, many of which are
written in five-four time for the left
hand and seven-four time for the
right. The limit of such accomplish
ment for the good pianist is to play
three-four time with the left hand,
while playing two-four with the right.
The average person is able to tap
three times with one hand to one
with the other.
Until Dr. Paul It. Farnsworth, as
sistant professor of psychology, re
corded the remarkable performance
of Hardcastle with a tap registering
mechanism called the polygraph, the
fact that such rhythm could be pro
duced by human hands was discred
ited by science. In this experiment the
scientist determined tlie degree of in
dependent action of the hands.
Hardcastle is individual as a musi
cian. The overtones from his music
are rendered from strings with al
tered tuning amplified by a resonance
box; still they are technically perfect.
To support his technique while mov
ing his hands so fast the eye can
hardly follow, he weights his wrists
with lead bands. "His playing can be
described as spectacular," says Dr.
Farnsworth.
Experimental work in the perform
ance of modernistic music is the
hobby of Dr. Farnsworth. lie is being
assisted in this work by William
Pointer.
