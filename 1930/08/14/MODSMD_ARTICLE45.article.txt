# STANFORD MAN SEES HUGE TURTLE LANDED
## 
### 
E. H. Shroder, an employee in the
Corporation Yard, was on the scene
when the giant 1500-pound turtle, re
cently captured off Santa Cruz, was
landed.
"The turtle was brought in by the
crew of a fishing boat, which battled
over four and a half hours with it.
finally being forced to stunt it by
shooting it before it could be landed,"
Sshroder said.
"Before the turtle was put on ex
hibition at Santa Cruz the carcass
was cleaned and salted down. The
heart weighed fifty-six pounds, while
the rest of the viscera weighed over
350 pounds. The meat was very pala
table."
The great reptile, the largest ever
seen in these northern waters, must
have traveled for many years to cover
the 12,000 miles from its native habi
tat, the Indian Ocean. To estimate
the age of the turtle closer than to the
nearest hundred years might entail
gross error, scientists suggest.
