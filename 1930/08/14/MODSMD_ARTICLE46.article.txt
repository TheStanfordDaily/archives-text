# MISSTEP LOSES 56-LB. RECORD TO KAZANJIAN
## 
### 
John Kazanjian threw the 50-pound
weight a distance of 4:-! feet and 0
inches at Fairfax last Sunday, several
feet farther than the world's record.
However, Kazanjian does not claim a
new record by beating the present
mark of 38 feet 9 inches held by Pat
McDonald of the New York police
force, as he had the misfortune of
stepping outside of the seven-foot cir
cle in making the throw. His next toss
of 30 feet and 9 inches won first place
in this event at the South-of-Market
Boys' picnic.
Harlow liothert tossed the 10-pound
shot a distance of 50 feet 4 inches to
win his event. Les Hables, the other
Stanford man entered in the picnic
day sports, had the misfortune to pull
a tendon in his first race and was
forced to withdraw.
