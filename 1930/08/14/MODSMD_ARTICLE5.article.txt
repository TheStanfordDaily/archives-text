# GRID OUTLOOK IS GIVEN BY COACH
## Thornhill Discusses Chances Of Next Year's Squad 
### 
i Regarding football prospects for the
| coming season. "Tiny" Thornhill, head
| line coach of the varsity squad, says:
I "We can only hope. There are too
I many factors which go toward mak
| ing a good team," he continued, "for
| one to be able to forecast with any
| accuracy chances for future success.
"Among the things determining our
I success at the start of the season
i will be the condition of returning
I members of the team. Our first game
i is September 20, which is only live
i days after training starts. One of the
i biggest tests of the season, our game
| with the Olympic Club, comes in the
I second week of practice.
"Another thing which will mean a
! lot throughout the season will be the
j support the team gets. Some people
seem to think that the same game is
j played regardless of the spirit of the
j looters. That's wrong, for the team
! members can sense just as easily as
! anyone else when spirit is at a high
! pitch, and they put a lot more into the
! game when they feel that the rest of
j the students are backing them."
Those who will be missed most this
j season, according to the coach, will
be Heinecke, Driscoll, Preston, Muller,
