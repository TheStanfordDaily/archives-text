# GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF HETCH HETCHY TO BE MADE BY GREEN
## 
### 
George E. Green of the Geology de
! partment is making an intensive study
of the soil, rock formations, and dif
i ferent structures being exposed by
the construction of the Hetch-Hetchy
I tunnel through (lie coastal range be
tween the San Joaqin Valley and San
Francisco Bay.
Green is collecting this informa
tion for his research problem toward
his Ph.D. degree. For tlie last six
| years he has been associated with
j various oil companies working in
South America and Mexico making
I penological surveys of the fields and
j looking for new oil regions.
I The tunnel will have twenty-seven
I openings. These shafts will produce
i several thousand different samples
! because of the varied formations
i through which they pass. Not only
j will samples be taken, but Green will
I make a series of maps and diagrams
j showing the differences in the forma
j t ions and locations of the various
strata of rock. In addition to this de
tailed examination of the interior of
the ranges the surface along the line
I of the tunnel will be carefully studied.
At the present time Green is* work
i ing under the direction of Dr. Wil
j liam H. Twenhofel, visiting professor
j from the University of Wisconsin,
i However, the major portion of the
j work will be carried on under Pro-
I lessor Eliot Blackwelder, chairman of
I the Department of Geology.
This research problem, when fln
! ished, will contain a detailed petro
-1 graphic study of the sedimentary and
j other kinds of rock of the ranges be-
I tween the Valley and San Francisco
i Bay which will serve as reference for
future work in the region.
