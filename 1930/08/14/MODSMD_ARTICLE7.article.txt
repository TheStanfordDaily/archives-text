# CAMPUS ORCHESTRA'S CONCERT CANCELLED
## 
### 
I Lack of enough instrumentation,
I and tiie moving away of several mem
| bers after the first term ended, caused
j the calling off of plans for a summer
concert by the campus orchestra,
which was organized this year with
Elwyn Hugge as concert-master.
Mrs. Marguerite McManus, violinist,
nf Portland. Oregon, is directing the
orchestra. Although hopes for a con
cert have been abandoned, the orches
tra lias worked out a program, and
has been practicing once a week.
