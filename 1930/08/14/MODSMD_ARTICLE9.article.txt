# SOLALINDE COMPARES SPANISH AND ITALIAN DICTATORS IN TALK
## 
### 
An interesting light was shed upon
j the political situation in Spain exist
ent during and after the dictatorship
jof Primo de Rivera in a lecture on
! "The Dictatorship and the Intellec
; tuals" given by Professor Antonio G.
i Solalinde Tuesday night in the Little
: Theatre.
In comparing the Spanish and
j Italian dictators, Solalinde said, "The
' former was all spontaneity and good
humor; the lattei is all affectation
| and ill-temper. A dictator like Musso
lini would never succeed in Spain; w.
Spaniards love tragedy but we cannot
stand the theatrical. The great dif-
I ference between Primo and Mussolini
I is that the Italian dictator has behind
j him a strong party; Primo did not
have any which would follow him dis
i interestedly."
i It was this lack of sincere backing
which turned Primo de Rivera to un
principled supporters and away from
j the intellectual leaders of the time
] whose liberal ideas he feared and sup
j pressed, in the opinion of the speaker,
j This subconscious hate of the intelli
gentsia resulted in a strict censorship
iof freedom of thought which finally
j culminated in student uprisings in
which de Rivera himself admitted
sustaining his "first defeat."
Professor Solalinde concluded his
j analysis with the following prophecy:
j "The old political parties are being
i organized with more or less difficulty,
] and we shall return to the old con
l stitutional political farce, because af
j tor all it is the least ridiculous farce
i we can find in politics, and it is the
least dangerous for kings."
