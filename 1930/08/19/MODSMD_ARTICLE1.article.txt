the playing field level, according to
plans of the Hoard of Athletic Control.

the change to be made now, but he
believes the work will be finished for'
the I!KJi season. The project when j
completed will represent an invest- |
ineiit of nearly half a million dollars, j
A new track will be necessary as
the new tier of seats will not leave
room for a track inside of tiie sta
dium. Plans indicate that the old track
located hear the varsity tennis courts
will be rebuilt. Bleachers to accom
modate 20,000 people will be erected
at Ibis site.
There will be no danger of a wet
playing field, because of it being be
low tile ground level, as it Is located
on a large gravel bed which affords
excellent drainage.
The increased size of the stadium
will make the seating capacity equal
to or maybe a little more than that
of the stadium at the University of
Southern California which was en
larged this year to accommodate
100,000 people. The Memorial Stadium
at Berkeley has a capcity of 72,000
