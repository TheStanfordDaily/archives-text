# 'The Stanford Axe' Is Published By Rival Alumni
## California And Stanford Men Delicate Book To Most Famous Tradition 
### 
Two men from rival universities
dropped intercollegiate hatred this
year long enough to publish a book
dedicated to Hie most famous of tra
ditional rivalries between their re
spective institutions. The men are
it. (J. O'Neil, California 'HI, and J. F.
Vander Kamp, Stanford '27. Their
book is "The Stanford Axe," appear
ing Saturday at the Stanford Book
store, where it will he sold for $1.25.
It was printed by the Stanford Univer
sity Press.
In this small volume, with Cardinal
letters and a Cardinal Axe on its
cover, the story of the famous weapon
is set forth by those connected with
both sides of the affair. The tale of
the birth of the "(live 'Em the Axe"
yell in the mind of Will Irwin and
of the symbolizing of the yell with an
actual axe, is told by "Dink" Temple
ton, '18, present track coach. Temple
ton goes on to tell of the capture of
the Cardinal symbol at its initial ap
pearance, at the Stanford-Cal base
ball, game in I8!)!t. This story is re
told in the next chapter by a scribe on
the victorious side, Brick Morse, Cali
fornia '96.
Skipping a period of thirty-one
years, during which time the Axe lay
in a vault jn Berkeley, the story of
the Axe is taken up, again told by
both sides of the conflict, with the
famous night last April, when twenty
one Sequoia men endeared them
selves to alumni, faculty, and students
by returning the Axe to Stanford. The
California side of the story is pre
sented in a sportsmanlike article by
Norman Horner, tlit* last of Califor
nia's long line of Axe custodians, from
whom the trophy was snatched.
The "twenty-one" have added their
story of the regaining of the Axe, as
it was printed in the Daily last spring,
and the book concludes with an article
by Wagner d'Alessio, Stanford '2!),
who describes the rally held in front
of the Library after the capture of
the Axe, and ends with the remark
that "after thirty years of security,
the Cardinals, too, might become just
a little careless. California wants the
Stanford Axe. Can Stanford keep the
Axe?"
