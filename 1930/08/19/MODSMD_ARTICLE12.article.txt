### Rose Marie Smith 
Four onejict plays presented Friday
j night, in lli(! Little Theatre by lit"
| dramatic production classes under the
supervision of Harold Helvenston
closed tin; season of campus drama
I wit.li an evening of variety in all pos
sible respects. Variation in plot was
J from farcical to sordid, while differ
ences in dramatic interpretation di
verged from indifferent to excellent.
The rising of the curtain disclosed
the setting for "Rosamund at the
Tracks," a highly nonsensical farce
by Anita llyttenburg and Albert Wein-
I berg, and directed by Guy Marker.
J The play had an element of satire
I also in the final triumph of interest
j over virtue in the mind of the heroine,
! who chooses the villain rather than
the hero.
The cutting of the linos, however,
i nearly ruined the whole performance,
j Two of the actors were too good for
11lie inaneness of their parts. Ellen
I Peters enacted the heroine who had
the mind of a rag doll, as well as
I could be expected in such a role, and
Herbert Jones, as the stereotyped vil
lain, did more than justice to the part.
| The sentimental hero was enacted by
| Arthur SchurlT who seemed to (it the
' character perfect ly.

A Sordid Act of Realism
('out.raslinn with Hut opening farce,
i;i sordid act of realism followed in
I the "Slump," written by Frederick
, Lansing Day and directed hy Nellie
I Mai Chapmen. The superficial and ex
| travagant wife, Florence Madden, was
j well port rayed by Dorothea Hawkins.
Credit is due Arthur Scharff for again
I appearing in a disagreeable role
I that of the weak-willed husband,
: James Madden. His wife's brother,
| Edgar Mix, who is far from blind to
I his sister's laziness, was accurately
| played by MacKenzie Cantin. The
play, although well presented, was de
pressing throughout in its lack of in
teresting characters. The playwright
included nothing lo relieve the mono
tony of the characters' utter cheap
ness.
A play by Henry Arthur Jones,
"The Knife," was the third presenta
tion. The performance was directed
by Waddington lllair, and the charac
ters included: the nurse, Helen Mc-
Cormick; Archie Kingston!, Kdward
Girzi; Sir Mark Ridgewny, Hartwell
Preston; Lady liidgeway, Anne Frick;
and Hartlett, a servant, Joseph Sloss.
