# VARIETY PREVAILS IN PLAYS UNDER STUDENT DIRECTION
## 
### Rose Marie Smith 
Four onejict plays presented Friday
j night, in lli(! Little Theatre by lit"
| dramatic production classes under the
supervision of Harold Helvenston
closed tin; season of campus drama
I wit.li an evening of variety in all pos
sible respects. Variation in plot was
J from farcical to sordid, while differ
ences in dramatic interpretation di
verged from indifferent to excellent.
The rising of the curtain disclosed
the setting for "Rosamund at the
Tracks," a highly nonsensical farce
by Anita llyttenburg and Albert Wein-
I berg, and directed by Guy Marker.
J The play had an element of satire
I also in the final triumph of interest
j over virtue in the mind of the heroine,
! who chooses the villain rather than
the hero.
The cutting of the linos, however,
i nearly ruined the whole performance,
j Two of the actors were too good for
11lie inaneness of their parts. Ellen
I Peters enacted the heroine who had
the mind of a rag doll, as well as
I could be expected in such a role, and
Herbert Jones, as the stereotyped vil
lain, did more than justice to the part.
| The sentimental hero was enacted by
| Arthur SchurlT who seemed to (it the
' character perfect ly.

A Sordid Act of Realism
('out.raslinn with Hut opening farce,
i;i sordid act of realism followed in
I the "Slump," written by Frederick
, Lansing Day and directed hy Nellie
I Mai Chapmen. The superficial and ex
| travagant wife, Florence Madden, was
j well port rayed by Dorothea Hawkins.
Credit is due Arthur Scharff for again
I appearing in a disagreeable role
I that of the weak-willed husband,
: James Madden. His wife's brother,
| Edgar Mix, who is far from blind to
I his sister's laziness, was accurately
| played by MacKenzie Cantin. The
play, although well presented, was de
pressing throughout in its lack of in
teresting characters. The playwright
included nothing lo relieve the mono
tony of the characters' utter cheap
ness.
A play by Henry Arthur Jones,
"The Knife," was the third presenta
tion. The performance was directed
by Waddington lllair, and the charac
ters included: the nurse, Helen Mc-
Cormick; Archie Kingston!, Kdward
Girzi; Sir Mark Ridgewny, Hartwell
Preston; Lady liidgeway, Anne Frick;
and Hartlett, a servant, Joseph Sloss.
Characters Over-Act Parts
Although written as a straight
drama the characters completely
ruined the serious effect of the play
by over-acting their parts until the
performance became a combination of
melodrama and farce. Due to misfits
in rasting the roles, one had the feel
ing thai he was witnessing the con
ventional triangle in the dramatization
of a cheap French novel. Many of the
lines, however, were well done, and
parts of the play, taken alone, were
effective. It was simply that the whole
production needed elevating to the
level of serious drama.
Concluding the program was the
well-known satire on psychoanalysis,
"Suppressed Desires," by Susan Glas
pell, and directed by Neva Price. Con
stance Morse gave a clever interpre
tation of Henrietta Brewster who is
a sophisticated convert of psycho
analysis. Her disgusted husband, Ste
phen Brewster, was well played by
Henry Sloss, and Elgie Ogier gave
an amusing performance of the naive
little sister, Mable.
The play was produced with an
originality which was a relief from
the usual hackneyed version. The re
partee was made really clever and
completely escaped any indication of
burlesque.

of a cheap French novel. Many of the
lines, however, were well done, and
parts of the play, taken alone, were
effective. It was simply that the whole
production needed elevating to the
level of serious drama.
Concluding the program was the
well-known satire on psychoanalysis,
"Suppressed Desires," by Susan Glas
pell, and directed by Neva Price. Con
stance Morse gave a clever interpre
tation of Henrietta Brewster who is
a sophisticated convert of psycho
analysis. Her disgusted husband, Ste
phen Brewster, was well played by
Henry Sloss, and Elgie Ogier gave
an amusing performance of the naive
little sister, Mable.
The play was produced with an
originality which was a relief from
the usual hackneyed version. The re
partee was made really clever and
completely escaped any indication of
burlesque.
