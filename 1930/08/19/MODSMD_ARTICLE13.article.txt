# SUMMER DAILY TO SING SWAN SONG IN THURSDAY'S ISSUE
## 
### 
All good things must come to
an end and the summer edition
of the Daily is no exception.
Thursday will see the last paper
roll from the press and gleeful
shouts are due to rise from all
sides. Here is your last oppor
tunity to see your name in print.
If you have been planning a mur
der or a mere elopement, it will
be well to get it done quickly in
order lo insure that it gets the
proper amount of publicity.
Perhaps you have been boiling
all slimmer with anger or dis
gust over some happening on the
campus or some altitude of the
Daily. Wednesday noon marks
the deadline, for the campus opin
ion column where one may get
rid of all excess steam.
Seriously speaking though, it
is particularly important thai all
announcements be turned in for
the final issue by Wednesday
noon.
