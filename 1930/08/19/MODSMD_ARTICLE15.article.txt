# SEVENTH SYMPHONY OF BEETHOVEN GIVEN SPANISH RENDITION
## 
### 
Fernandez Arbos concluded the
symphony season in the Woodland
Theatre Sunday, with a typically Span
ish interpretation of Beethoven's
Seventh Symphony. He conducted
with a delicacy totally foreign to Ger
man music, yet lacking none of the
effectiveness of a more majestic pres
entation.
Arbos emphasized the many lyric
passages of melody in the symphony
as he did in tiie Spanish compositions
included in the second half of the
program, -In a like manner, lie tem
pered the "Meistersinger" Overture
of Wagner in accordance with the
Latin taste. Although more restrained
than is usual in Wagnerian interpreta
tions, the Overture was still charac
teristic of the greatest composer of
German opera.
As he conducts Arbos seeius to be
working out a pattern through the
medium of music. This was especially
apparent during the symphony and
the Overture. It was when the con
ductor presented the composition;! of
his own country that he departed
from his previous classic restraint.
The melodic sensuousness of the
"Goyescas" intermezzo by Granadas
was particularly lovely. In his own
composition, the Intermezzo from the
"Arabian Nights," which was played
from manuscript, Arbos might have
been conducting a real Spanish orch
estra from the excellence of the ill
terpretat ion.
Likewise "La Procession du Kocio"
by Turina and "Triana" from the
suite "Iberia" by Albeniz and nr
ranged for orchestra by Arbos pos
sessed the true spirit of Spain. Arbos
seemed to enjoy an opportunity to
depict the vivid and fiery rhythm of
his native land.
