# ORDEAL BY EXAMINATION
## 
### 
One of the quaint customs of the Middle Ages was'that of trial hy
ordeal. Non remember—the accused person carried a red-hot iron six
paces or dipped liis hand in hoi ling water for a short period and if he
was innocent of the charge his hand would suffer no ill effects.
In a tew days (distressingly few) we shall he subjected to the
"oreal hy examination." The high priests of learning have accused us of
the crime of ignorance. We are assumed to he guihv until we prove our
innocence. We are to prove our innocence bv making answers to certain
questions asked hy the high priests. 11 we guess correctlv, we are
exculpated. If we don't, we are guilty. Simple hut effective.
Since we have that form of trial, why not revive another method
ihat has fallen into desuetude—that ol trial hv combat ? The onlv trouble
is ihat some of the professors might have trouble making the results lit
ihe normal probability curve.
Seriously, however, in spite of Professor lieujaniin's rather benign
attitude toward examinations as expressed in an interview found on
another page ol this paper, most ol us have difficulty in approaching
them with the proper sangfroid. Even though we have diligently read
all assignments and taken careful notes, the fear haunts us that we mav
have slipped up on some point. And that point, like* an avenging Nemesis,
will confront us in the "ex."
We may be comforted by the fact, however, that examinations do
not play the important role tlicy once did in school life. Even in uni
versities, those bulwarks of traditional educational program, the in
structors realize that a student might possibly fail to answer the required
number of questions correctly and yet have an adequate knowledge of
the subject. The above statement, let it be said parenthetically, is not to
be taken seriously as a working premise: it is to be used onlv in moments
of distress.
