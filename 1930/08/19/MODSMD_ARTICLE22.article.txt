# HAS ANYBODY SEEN KELLY?

Surely von know Kcllv â€”"Kelly with the straw hat on"? In the good
old days Kelly was a popular personage hut an exceedingly difficult one
to locate, liesides the straw hat he could he identified by other gear
such as a red necktie. I lowever. il is the straw hat that is difficult to
locate today, and Kellv would prohahlv not he seen with one under any
circumstances. We refer, of course, to the "skimmer" that still main
tains a part of its former popularity with the masses. The well-dressed
man on the other hand demands some type of "Panama." if he wears a
summer hat at all.
That last clause is the real tiling that is worrying the hat manufac
turers today. Starting as a collegiate custom, the hatless fad has spread
far beyond the limits of the campus and has reached the stage hevond
that of a mere fad. Man takes a long time to become emancipated from
the hampering restrictions of style but when he finally does obtain
release he hangs tenaciously to his new-found freedom, l ew men that
have become accustomed to hatless days would willingly give them up.
I loth economy and comfort enter into their decision. There are many,
however, that claim that it is false economy and a poor idea of comfort.
I lardlv a day passes that we are not able to pick tip a newspaper and
lead an article by some doctor explaining the dangers of exposing a thin
skull to the merciless rays of the sun. < >ulv the other day a prominent
San Francisco newspaper devoted a large portion of its editorial page
to an attack on the hatless fad. Despite the fact that these articles and
editorials often appear to have the advertising pages in mind, it must be
admitted that there is at least a small amount of truth in their arguments.
While men in the tropics go crazy in the open without head covering.
I hit our climate is not quite tropical.
Many people are advocating the further emancipation of the male
from hampering styles. Investigations have shown that during the recent
hot spell in the East the average weight of the men's clothes was about
six pounds while that of the average woman was only about one pound.
It has been suggested that the men adopt shorts, at least for summer
wear, in order to cut down on the weight carried. We doubt if the
suggestion will ever be universally adopted. We have become accus
tomed to the peculiarities of the nether extremities of the women but
one look at a picture of the Duke of York convinces us that men would
present greater difficulties.
