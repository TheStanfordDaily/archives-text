leaping into view.
And sooner than that, the last of
the Summer Quarter Daily.
Don't cheer, men.

I'm far "in the red," you see,
And I would that my checkbook would
stand
The wants that arise in me.

As he goes in his high-powered car, j
But I ride in a borrowed flivver,
With many a jolt and jar.

And the stately profs go by
j To their havens on San Juan hill,
And I read their lengthy assign

But wholly against my will.

i Us men have to stick together!
Stanford women gave a faculty dinner i
