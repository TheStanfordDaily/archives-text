# BENJAMIN EXPLAINS VIEWS ABOUT FINAL EXAMINATIONS
## 
### 
"Do I approve of examinations?"
Dr. Harold It. Henjamin of the Edu
cation department of Stanford Uni
versity smiled quizzically ai tin hope
ful reporter sitting before him; looked
ruefully at the mass of term papers,
blue books, and other unmistakable
evidences of inquisitorial apparatus
surrounding; his desk; and then re-
I marked:
"You know, that question reminds
me of a similar one propounded by
the poet, Coleridge, who replied,;
1 when asked his views on Unitarian- i
ism, that, before answering so simple
a query he must first review the
origin, progress, present status, and
future implications of religious experi
j ences. So, in the case of indicting
examinations upon the devotees of
| Minerva, a thorough survey of mod
-1 ern educational theory would lir. t
have to be conducted in order to at
tain any significant conclusions in so
i serious a discussion."
Tests Measure of Accomplishment
The education instructor looked !
pleadingly at his watch, and then at ;
his interrogate!', but the latter per- ;
sisted â€” "And what do you think of
the present practice of giving exam
inations during, and al the end of a

| course ?"
"Without a doubt tests of some wort
necessary as a measure of student ac
complishment Dr. Benjamin replied [
I seriously. "The fact that they are !
being severely criticized is an indica- j
it ion that there is room lor improve
ment, not that the tests should be j
eliminated. Although the essay ex- i
lamination of the past lias been open
j to harsh and bitter censure, the new
| fangled true and false tests in vogue
now have been proved to be th.> least
1 reliable of all objective tests, accord
i
] ing to Dr. G. M, Ruch, professor of
. education at the University of Cali
-1 fornia.
Grading System Essential
"As far as grading is concerned,"
continued the speaker, "it is foolish
to talk about doing away with marks.
I The plus and minus system of rating
students is merely a more inclusive
I method of gradation than the custom
ary five level scheme. Personally, I
iam in of the 'pass' or 'fail'
I
method in the graduate school."
Jn conclusion. Dr. Benjamin con
; doned the fact that the interview had
i been centered around the unfortunate
j topic el' examinations, especially at
j this time of the year when no one's
! fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
j grades. "Now any time you are in
' terested in presenting my fishing ex
periences to tlie public." he preferred
generously, as the jubilant reporter
backed out el' the office, "my 'line' is
j really good."
