### 
Summer students receive about 1"'
per cent less mail per person than
winter students, according to Post
master W. C. Werrv. About half as
many air mail letters and one-fifth
as many special deliveries are re
ceived at Stanford during the sum
mer quarter as during any quarter of
the regular school year, while the
number of laundry cases handled is
negligible in comparison with tlie
number sent out and received during
the regular session.
Despite these facts, practically the
same amount of work is done by the
post office during the summer because
much mail addressed to persons who
were here during the regular session
has to be sorted and then forwarded,
making double service necessary.
"An unusual difficulty arises from
the fact that many summer quarter
students who are here for the second
time do not notify the office of their
return," Mr. Werry says, "so that
their letters are forwarded to the
home address left here at the end
of their former sojourn at Stanford."
