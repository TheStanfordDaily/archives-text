# MINIATURE GOLF MAY PREVENT KRENZ TOUR
## 
### 
No definite plans have been made
by Eric Krenz and "Casey" Kazanjian
for their exhibition tour of Australia
which was previously announced.
"We are sorry the news of our pro
posed trip leaked out," Kazanjian told
a Daily reporter, "because we are not
sure that we will go. If our present
business venture in establishing a
chain of miniature golf courses
throughout the northern part of Cali
fornia proves successful, we will not
likely have time for any pleasure
trips; at least, not very soon."
