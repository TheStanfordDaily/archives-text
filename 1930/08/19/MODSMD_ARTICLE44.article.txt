# LEON LOUFBOUROW PREACHES ON GOD'S GOODNESS, SEVERITY
## 
### 
"The goodness and the severity of
tied" was the topic of the sermon de
livered by the Rev. Leon L. Loof
bourow of Berkeley Sunday morning
in the Memorial Church. This text,
from the eleventh chapter of Romans,
he said was suggested to him by
David Starr Jordan twelve years ago.
Loofboiirow was graduated from Stan
ford in the class of '02.
"The goodness and the severity of
Cod are illustrated biologically as well
as morally," the preacher declared.
"The vast, number of fossils on the
earth's crust show His severity to
creatures that cannot adapt them
selves. As Dr. Jordan has said, 'Na
tural extinction is as important as na
tural selection in the way things are
today.'
"Both Cod's goodness and Cod's se
verity are necessary. Jesus, though
reticent about the future, emphasized
this phase of Cod's justice. No teacher
of man ever emphasized so much the
immediacy of the danger of vice and
the severity of Cod in its punishment.
"The great function of the Church
of Jesus Christ, however, is to preach
the goodness of Cod to generations of
men. It, is perhaps true that we have
lately bee n discussing the morals 100
much, the message not enough. Our
levered, sixteen-cylinder ago needs
nothing so much as conviction of the
goodness of Cod. It is a question of
choosing between two masters—God,
or gold."
The service was supplemented by
an anthem sung by the Women's
Choir, and by a solo sung by Otis
Harrington, tenor.
