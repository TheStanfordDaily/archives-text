# LOST BAGS MOURN FAIR OWNERS; GET THEM QUICK, GIRLS

"Finders keepers, losers weepers"
| seems to be the plaintive cry of a
| motley assortment of unclaimed arti-
I cles temporarily housed at the Lust
and Found department in the Admin
istration building. If these derelicts
! are not called for within thirty days
'from the date of delivery they revert
hack to tlie sleuths who turned them
in.
1 There seems to he a fairly rapid
; t urn-over of watches, pens, eversharps,
fraternity pins, and brooches in the
foundling shelter, hut an element of
pathos enters in'to the spectacle of
the old-timers that are neither kept
| nor wept. A lonely heaver coat cuff,
a wistful widowed glove, a dauntless
.regiment of battle-scarred handbags
making acute appeal for the day long
past of the ample reticule there are
but a few of Hie pitiful relics that are
living out their days in a sunless
cubbyhole.
