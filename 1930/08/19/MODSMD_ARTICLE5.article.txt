# Divorces Not An Evil Believes Dr. Beach
## Ties Which Bind Families Together Loosed In Modern Life 
### 
"Divorce is not an evil. II i.s merely j
hut indication of difi'n iffty." Thus
stated Professor Waller Greenwood j
j Beach of the Stanford School of Social
i Sciences in an interview with the
j Daily yesterday.
"Two hundred years ago people got
married because tlieir parents had ar- i
j ranged il or because they lived on ad- !
| jacent farms. People did not get di
vorced because it was economically
necessary that they should stay to
gether. The family was united by com
mon occupation, common religion,
common recreation, and education."
In modern times these common in
terests are tending to disappear. Peo
ple in cities live in small apartments
and are no longer held together by
I the ties of land ownership. Different
j members of the family have different
| work and different amusements. Wo- |
men desire careers. It is no longer !
believed that one is a good mother [
just because she is a woman, any j
more than one is a good farmer just !
\ because he is born on a farm.
I"The changes from agricultural to '
| mechanical industries have thus had !
! a great effect on the life of the mod- j
; ern family," remarked Professor
I Beach. "The migratory life which
j many occupations require has les
j sened common sympathies and inter-|
| ests, and has provided the cause for j
j many separations and divorces.
"Contrary to common belief, tlie
(average unskilled worker is divorced
I or separated quicker than the average
j middle class man. These workers
; form a great part of our population
j and thus to some extent are respons- j
I ible for the increasing prevalency of
J divorce. Affection is absolutely the
; only tie which binds, the family to
gether, and unless that, affection is
deepened by the love of children, il
often dies.
