# EXHIBIT OF CHINESE ART, SCROLL WORK OPENS AT GALLERY
## 
### 
An exhibition of Chine.se scroll and
fan paintings, ihe work? of Mrs. V. M.
I Liang of Peking, China, was opened at.
the Stanford Ail Gallery Sunday and
will continue until August 31. The
collection is being loaned by the art
ist's son, Liang Chili-Chang, who is a
i Stanford student.
Mrs. Liang, who paints under the
name of Lien-Su, belongs to the school
of painting called t lie Kung-Pi, the
Labored Pen, a very ancient school
which lias only recently been revived
in China. Mrs. Liang is now teaching
this art in Peking.
Among the characteristics of tiiis
school is the use of very fine strokes,
so fine that special brushes of only a
| single hair or only a few linirs are
I often necessary to execute the strokes,
j Stress is laid on coloring and realism.
The paintings are done almost ex
clusively on silk, while the color pig
| ments are dissolved not in water but
|in disinfected lisli glue, which ac
counts for tiie fact, that century-old
I paintings of this kind have retained
j their brilliancy despite the disintegra
i tion of tiie silk. It is necessary that
] the whole paint ing or at least a full
j section of the painting be done at one
| setting and in daylight in order that
ilthe 'delicate color shading may be
j even and fresh throughout.
The Stanford Art Gallery is open
jilyily to the public from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m. Admission is free.
