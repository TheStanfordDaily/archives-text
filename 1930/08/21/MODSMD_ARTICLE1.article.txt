### 
With the near completion of the
highway along the campus, work on
the beautilication of the entrance to
Stanford at Palm Drive was started
yesterday, following the receipt of the
final plans by Comptroller Almon E.
Roth.
Dummy structures were being
erected yesterday at both sides of the
drive with a view to determining the
best set-back distance for the red
tiled sandstone towers which will
Hank the entrance. The original plan
was to place them ISO feet back from
the highway, but this distance may
be decreased. All arch will be cut
through each tower for a pedestrian
sidewalk and curved wing walls will
run from each out toward El ('amino
Real. The half-circle in front of this
entrance will then be landscaped.
Erection of a new chain link fence
for the entire highway frontage be
tween San Francisquito creek and the
southern boundary, the Palm Drive
entrance, and a new ornamental gate
way to the Stanford Home for Con
valescent. Children is expected to cost
in the neighborhood of $30,000.
Demolishing of the present Palm
Drive gates and erection of the new
towers is expected to be under way
within two weeks. The drive will be
kept open throughout the construc
tion period, Roth stated.
