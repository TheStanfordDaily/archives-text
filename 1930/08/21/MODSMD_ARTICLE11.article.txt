# MUSIC AND DANCING TO BE FEATURE OF "MID-SUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM" PRODUCTION
## New Version of Shakespearian Play To Be Presented at Menlo Circus Club Saturday for Convalescent Home Benefit; Campus Actors Have Roles 
### 
An entirely different version of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will he
presented at the Menlo Circus Club Saturday. This play, which is a benefit
for the Stanford Convalescent Home, has been remodeled many times to fit
the fashion of the period, so there is nothing particularly new in arranging
it for masque presentation. When Max Rheinhardt made his production,
which was seen a season or two ago in New York, he decorated the play in
baroque style. Harley Granville Barker, in a production made fifteen years
ago, had his players wear stiff metal wigs on which the curls were tightly

wound. The costumes, too, had the
; look of metal, the whole having some
i what of a bas-relief effect.
Seeks Pastoral Beauty
Condensation of the play for the
present production lias been done by
Junius Cravens. Only the portions
dealing with the immortal little peo
ple and the group of horny-handed
! workmen preparing their tragedy of
"Pyramus and Tliisbe" is retained.
This cutting brings the playing time
into little more than an hour, allow
l ing for dinner parties before the per
formance and other entertaining after
i wards.
With the aid of music and the dance
Cravens will attempt to bring out the
pastoral beauty of the action, using
| gifted amateurs in preference to pro
fessionals. He believes that the in
ingenuousness of the unspoiled ama
teur is of real artistic value.
The scene will be among the oaks
011 Menlo grounds, the setting ar
-1 ranged to maintain an atmosphere of
intimacy between audience and play
ers. As announced, the locale has been
made Venice instead of Athens, and
I costumes of the late seventeenth cen
tury will be featured.
Quartet Will Sing
Gilded East Indian fairies, among
, other departures from the traditional
' Greek, light of foot and in swaying
rhythm, will interpret the enchanting
| fairy music. A quartet will sing to
i the accompaniment of an orchestra
hidden behind a wall of green hedge
1 and pillars of live oak. Carol Weston,
