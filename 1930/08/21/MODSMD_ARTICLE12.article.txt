"Co-operation is the basis of all the
work done by the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children," Mar
garet M. Lothrop, acting secretary of
the society in San Francisco, said yes
terday to a reporter. Miss Lothrop is
, a graduate of Smith College. She did
I graduate work at Stanford University
land from l!)l. r > to 1028 was a member
j of the Stanford faculty.
A radical change 111 the trend of
j social work lias been noticeable in the
organization. The San Francisco so
i ciety was established in 1876 and had
the honor of being the second or
ganization in the United States, that
of New York having been the first.
Its activities were at first largely on
a punitive basis; that is, its purpose
; was to prevent cruelty and neglect
of children by punishing the parents
or those who inflicted it. The new ob
jective, however, is the protection of
I children through the instruction and
supervision of parents and the preven
tion of wrong situations.
The new system, says Miss Lothrop,
lias accomplished infinitely more than
the old one did. "The very fact of hav
ing the thing put squarely before t hem
will often affect the parents and make
| them realize their duty to (lie chil
dren. There is usually a solution to
every situation.
"In cases when both parents are
working, relatives, neighbors, the
landlady, or the day nursery is called
i upon to care for the children. It is
only when the parents refuse to co
f operate or when the conditions of the
home are hygienically or morally im
possible that a petition is made to
tiie juvenile court and the child is
made a ward of the court.
"An honest appreciation of the dif
ficulties which many of the parents
experience is half the battle," Miss
Lothrop continued. "The main purpose
of the S.P.C.C. is to provide the proper
environment for the child, which is,
if possible, in the child's own home."
