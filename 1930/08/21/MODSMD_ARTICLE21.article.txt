Willi this edition, Volume 77;i of Tiik Stanford Daily passes into
that ntter oblivion reserved for old newspaj>ers. It precedes bv a few
days the end of the 1 ( J30 summer quarter. As a final gesture we bid
farewell to all those who have patiently searched our columns for news
each I lies (.lay and I hursdav. We have felt an obligation to our readers,
and believe it or not, have tried to fulfill that obligation.
One regrettable lack in the Daily this summer has been the campus
opinion column. To the writers of the few letters received, we are
grateful, lint in regard to the others we can believe either that condi
tions at Stanford are so nearly perfect that no complaint or condemna
tion is necessary, or that you were too occupied with your work to write
anything. Either our editorial columns were so convincing that no con
trary argument was possible or they were so inane that none was merited.
There could be a difference of opinion.
.\t any rate we have given you the news, such as it was. We have
expressed our opinion, such as it is.
See you again next summer.
