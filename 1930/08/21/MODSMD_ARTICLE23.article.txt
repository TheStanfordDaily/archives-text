# BUSINESS MANAGER HAS A GOOD IDEA
## 
### 
The business manager, you may have noticed, lias been using some
of the space in his part of the paper recently to suggest that you subscribe
to I in-: Stanford Daii.v for the next college year if vou are not going
to be* on the campus, in order that you may know what is going on at
Stanford. It is a worthy idea.
The Daii.v during other quarters than the summer is really a daily
and its news is fresh when it reaches youâ€”fresh and carrying a breath
of Stanford life. You will want to know what is going on here.
People expect you to know about Stanford affairs. With the Daii.v
you won't be embarrassed by having to guess; you will know.
The only serious deterent we can think of is four dollars, and the
Daii.v for a year is certainly to be prefererd to eight movie shows.
