# THINGS HOPED FOR
## 
### 
Stanford people have seen several long-cherished dreams put under
way toward actuality this quarter, and it is worth while to lake a moment
to be cheerful about them.
The women's gym is being spread over an area of ground and up
into the air so extensively that it resembles some civic center building.
With steel work being put into place form is beginning to be impres
sively apparent.
(ioodness knows the crowded denizens of the Press building with
its flimsy partitions have longed through many years for such quarters
as have been completed for them this summer, and the Daii.v staffs of
next year will rejoice in added elbow room.
Work is under way to replace the unsuitable old remainders of a
gateway at the main entrance to the campus with an appropriate and
dignified portal. That is a thing that many have wished for through
many years.
And the Cellar has been kept open for the whole quarter. Summer
after summer Stanford students have hoped that the Cellar would not
be closed in the middle of the term â€”and hoped in vain. I Jitter words
have been spoken. It is pleasant to be able now to express appreciation
and gratitude.
