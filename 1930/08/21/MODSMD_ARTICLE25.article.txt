Another list of the "sixty great novels of rill time" has recently been
released. This time Professor \Y. I ; . 11. Lamont of the English depart
ment of Rutgers University has done the selecting and is the recipient
of the current wave of criticism. Too much comment has already heen
made in the newspapers and magazines of the country as to the true
greatness of the novels included to further waste your time on that aspect.
It is interesting to note, however, the number of "the great sixty"
that have been read by various representative Stanford students. The
highest number that had been read by any member of the Daily staff
was thirty-one; the lowest, six. Women evidently are satisfied with
lighter material, for few seem to have read more than ten. One in
structor, w ho is known to be a fairly constant reader, refused to comment
other than to say that there were few that he had actually read. And so
it seems to be among most college students.
Shall we consider this as an indictment of the cultural education of
the average college student? Hardly, when we consider that few men
can agree tlpon what are really the "sixty great" books of all time. It is
extremely doubtftil if any such list can be limited to a mere sixty. Much
li.'is been said about the reading of the average college youth being
limited to humor magazines, but after all it is surprising how much he is
able to crowd in between reports and examinations.
