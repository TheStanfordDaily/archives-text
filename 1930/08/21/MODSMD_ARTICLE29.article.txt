# SONG OF THE MORON

### 
i think that it. is nice to he
u full-fledged, learned ph.d.
book larnin' ain't for nuts like me,
■ so whotthehell, whotthehell.
j i have less than no i.q.
wotinell should dumbbells do?
; but somehow i don't feel blue,
so whotthehell, whotthehell!
ji took ed. 195
i peppy class and much alive.
! old schoolmarms for "a's" did strive,
, but whotthehell, whotthehell!
; summer quarter's over soon,
meeting jane, a god-sent boon,
necking oft by light of moon —
so whotthehell, whotthehell!
