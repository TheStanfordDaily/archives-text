porary arrangement," says E. S. Er
win, University auditor. "The trac
tion company decided to discontinue

their cars were being operated at a
loss. Rather than lose the service, we
asked them to try the buses on this
run."
According to the traction company's
! reports the, buses are no more profit
able than tile street cars were. How
ever, one expense has been eliminated
in tlie use of buses. The traction com
pany does not pay anything for the
franchise to run their buses on tlie
campus whereas when they were oper
i ating the street cars they paid the
University rent for use of the tracks
and had to hire their own mainten
ance crew to repair the tracks.
Use of the buses has removed some
