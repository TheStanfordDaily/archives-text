# Individualism Is Modern Day Keynote
## Many Philosophies Evident Declares Professor McGilvary 
### 
| Individualism lias become the key
j note to modernism in the opinion of
[ Professor Evander H. McGilvray, act
| ing professor of philosophy from the
j University of Wisconsin, and well
i known writer of philosophical works.
"The present is a day of many
philosophies. It is also an age of
scientific discovery and revolution. As
in such periods during the past, es-
I tablished philosophy lias been torn to
pieces and re-established, not as one
school, but as many," stated Profes
sor McGilvary to a reporter. He went
on to explain that contemporary philo
sophies are a reaction from the Vic
! torian Idealism of the nineteenth cen
| tury.
Trend of Thought Promising
Although skepticism and synicism
! are prevalent, the trend in philoso
j phical thought is both interesting and
| promising, McGilvary believes. In the
j "Anthology of Recent Philosophy" by
j Daniel Sommer Robinson, Professor
; McGilvary is included with the philo
j sophers of Realism. In discussing
j Realistic philosophy, McGilvary makes
I the pointed statement that "Time is
a promise and a threat; the stream
j we breast holds in solution our hopes
) and fears. Time is a regret and re
| lief; the solution precipitates some
j beautiful crystal, but alas! we are
| swept onward and to our sorrow must
j leave the treasure behind."
This statement applies particularly
| to the present era. Most people today
j do not have a formulated philosophy
j of life because they are constantly oc
! cupied 111 the mad rush of their
I chaotic existence.
Lack of Reflection Apparent
"In the lives of the majority of
1 college students this lack of time for
1 reflection is especially apparent. Most
j students show far more influence as
the result of religious thought than
from any philosophical contempla
tion," McGilvary said. "Skepticism
i had been the result of much of this
j attempted solution of religious prob
j lenis by students, resulting from
i narrow-minded and prejudiced paren
! tal influence.
"The student who has been allowed
I to form his own religious opinions is
j much less likely to change his views
j radically when he enters a university,
i This type of student will also find it
| easier to arrive at a consistent and
workable philosophy of life."
111 conclusion, he said; "Those who
do not have a philosophy need not be
discouraged, since the true meaning of
life can be discovered only after years
of experience."
