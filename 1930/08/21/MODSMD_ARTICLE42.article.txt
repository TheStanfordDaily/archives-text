# FUTURE OF AVIATION UNCERTAIN ACCORDING TO WHITTELSEY, '20
## Rapidly Changing Industry Invites Young Men 
### 
"The future of the aviation indus- 1
try is as uncertain as the trend of ,
the stock market for the next year," j
was the opinion of Stuart G. Whit- j
telsey, '20, now vice-president of the |
Associated Air Lines, Inc., expressed i
yesterday in an interview for the j
Daily.
"As an industry to attract the |
young man and woman of today it |
has no equal. It is one of the world's
most colorful industries, and one I
which is changing so rapidly that the |
beginner of today is the veteran of to- !
morrow.
"Right now, the major problem is
the matter of stepping up production
to a point where it will be possible to
cut down the costs and thus increase
the demand for services and planes."
Industry Moves Ahead
"Aviation has made tremendous 1
strides during the past year," de
clared Whittelsey, "until now it has
taken its place as one of the foremost
industries of the country. During the
past month Hawks travelled from the
West coast to the East coast in a
little over twelve hours. A feat of
lliis kind, little dreamed of a few
years ago, opens up a vast field for
transportation by air."
The annihilation of time through
air transportation means that within
a few years the clerk in California
with a two weeks' vacation will be
able to go around the world, the of
ficial Suggested. If his ideas and his
purse are not of such dimensions as
to encompass such a trip, he can for
only a moderate fee leave the Pacific
Coast and be in New York the same
day, and return the last day ready to
go to work.
Comfort Increased
Increasing comfort and safety fac
tors were also mentioned as having
added to the value of aviation as an
industry. The new luxurious thirty
passenger planes now leaving daily
for Los Angeles have increased great
ly the interest of the public in this
rapid method of transportation.
"Then, too, today's planes are built
to withstand every conceivable situa
tion that might arise," Whittesley
continued. "A visit to the shops of
the School of Aviation located 011 the
campus, near Mayfield, are a revela
tion to the most casual observer. Re
pairs are being made at all times on
both the older type and the newer
type of planes."
