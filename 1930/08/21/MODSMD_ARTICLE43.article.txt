# SPANISH ROMANTICISM CORRUPT SAYS PEERS
## 
### 
That romanticism in Spain in the
nineteenth century was more corrupt
than the romanticism of other coun
tries, and is misunderstood today be
cause of attempts to compare it with
the romanticism of France, is the
opinion of Professor E. Allison Peers,
of Columbia University, who lectured
in the Little Theatre yesterday on
"Thee Nature of Spanish Romanti
cism."
Professor Peers devoted the first
part of his lecture to a discussion of
romanticism in general, and the dis
tinctions between romanticism and
classicism. 111 spite of attempts to
reconcile the two, Professor Peers be
lieves that they are opposites, and
pointed out the three main differ
ences. First, he explained that the
classic restrains imagination for the
purpose of having perfect form, while
the romantic writer gives his imagina
tion free rein. Second, the classical
writer is clear in definition, while the
romanticist is dreamy and vague. His
last point was that the romantic
writer is inclusive and cosmopolitan
in his subjectivity, while the classicist
is selective.
