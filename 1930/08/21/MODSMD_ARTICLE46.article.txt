# COLLECTING AND DRAWING COATS OF ARMS UNUSUAL HOBBY OF PROFESSOR JACOBSEN
## 
### 
Souvenirs ol' the "days of old, when
knight.s were bold" have heen col
lected and studied by Dr. Lydik S.
Jacobsen of the Department of Mech
anical Engineering, who has made
colored drawings of coats of arms of
European families and has also more
than 500 wax seals, dating back to the
twelfth century.
When he was a boy in Denmark,
Dr. Jacobsen made two books of coats
of arms, which he drew from the di
rections in tlie Danish book of peer
age, a book describing the various
family emblems.
"Heraldry is not necessarily artis
tic," said Dr. Jacobsen, "hut it can be
made so by the artist taking heraldic
diction. As in handwriting, the indi
vidual does not have to follow a per
fect model." He explained that the
artist who draws a coat of arms from
the description in the book is not
limited in his interpretation of the
directions, but is partly left to his
own taste. For instance, directions
may call for a "brown lion in a blue
background," but the exact appear
ance of the animal is not designated.
Thus the coat of arms of one family
is always the same in plan, but the
details mav vary.
Crest Used on Signature
The wax seals, which Jacobsen col
lected during the years 1!)08 to 1916,
were exhibited at Stanford three
years ago. Most of them were made
by molding new wax in the original
signets, or molds, but a few are the
original wax seals. Many are seals of.
the noble families of Europe, and
others are those of states, cities,
guilds, or churches. Red wax was gen
erally used, hut black wax was used
when a family or state was in mourn
ing.
"The seal was used as a signature,
since it could be recognized by people
who could not read," said Dr. Jacob
sen. "The seal of a town contains a
picture to suggest that town, such as
a five-towered church, or a seven
span bridge.
"Prom the thirteenth century to the
nineteenth, there were numerous
tradesmen's guilds, and the seal of
each guild depicted the most com
monly used implements of those
tradesmen." He has those of the
bakers .ornamented with pretzels, and
some seals of the carpenters, who
were known by a compass. For some
unknown reason, the bootmaker chose
to be symbolized by a two-headed
eagle.
Has Two Royal Seals
Guilds usually were sponsored by
a saint or king. King Canute was
canonized after he had been killed
at Odense, and in his honor a guild
was formed by the burghers of
Odense. Their seal shows the mon
arch who tried to rule the waves.
An interesting feature of this seal
is the crowding of the Latin letters
which form a motto around the outer
edge; the engraver did not determine
the space needed on the signet for
the letters, and consequently he had
to crowd the last ones, and continued
the last word on an inner circle.
Dr. Jacobsen has two royal seals,
of Danish kings. These are not mod
ern molds of the old seals, but are
the original wax. Besides them, lie
has private seals of Queen Victoria,
King Louis Philippe, Frederick VII
of Denmark, and the Empress Dagmar
of Russia.
Private Seals Have Shields
"State seals and royal seals," the
collector said, "were used on docu
ments, and if the document was of
relatively small importance, tlie seal
was made with a paper cover." This
means that paper was placed between
the signet and the wax.
Seals on more important things,
such as international treaties, were
not paper covered. Often a seal was
encased in gold, silver, or wood. One
which he has now is about four inches
in diameter, and is encased in a round
box of rosewood.
Private seals always contain the

family shield, and, Dr. Jacobsen says,
are usually less ornate among the
older families. One of the family
shields in his collection is that of the
ancestors of Dr. L. B. Becking, pro
fessor of Biology at Stanford.
Crown Replaces Crest
"The general pattern of a seal is
i formed from the appearance a knight
I made, with his shield on his left arm
land his helmet showing above the
| shield," Dr. Jacobsen said, as he
! showed the reporter a number of
| seals with helmets and crowns sur
mounting them. The shield is sup
' ported on each side by guardians, in
I th" form of animals or aborigines.
Armorial bearings of a husband and
| wife are made by combining the two
escutcheons, with the husband's on
i the left and the wife's on the right.
! "In most cases a single crown takes
| the place of the family crests," accord
-1 ing to Dr. Jacobsen, who added that
j if a chain of knighthood is shown sur-
I rounding the escutcheon of the lius
; band, a garland of flowers decorates
J that of the wife.
Concerning the crowns on coats of
j arms and seals it was explained that
1 a five-pointed one means that the
! owner is simple nobility, a seven
i pointed crown indicates a baron,
while a count lias nine points. The
i royal crown is made differently, hav
i ing no points, but coining together at
illie top to form a cap-shaped crest.
