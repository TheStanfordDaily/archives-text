## 
### 
Italy's difficulties, such as shortage
of fuel, a meagre supply of iron and
other natural resources are not a sign
of disaster, according to Professor
Ernest INI. Patterson, of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania in a lecture Tues
day evening in the Little Theatre.
Professor Patterson's subject was
"Italy's Difficult Task."
"The gap in Italy's natural re
sources must he filled with the in
visible items of trade, such as freight
charges and tourists' expenditures.
Like other countries Italy should
maintain a free flow of goods and
services in and out," he said.
The procedures that he suggested
as a means to adjust the problems of
trade for Italy are to shift the strain
from a national to an international
basis and to find ways of adjusting
disputes, why h will avoid the direct
appeal of governments.
