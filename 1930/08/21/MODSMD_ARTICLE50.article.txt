### 
Before it was called the "bawl-out,"
a directory of officers and students of
Stanford University was published,
even back in the "days of '91." The
volume publislied for the year 1891-
1892, the first year at Stanford, is
thinner than the one which now re
veals things about students and fac
ulty, and had the distinction of not
publishing the scholastic averages of
the Farm inhabitants.
The faculty that first year num
bered thirty-nine professors, and
twenty-six were added the following
autumn. Of the first thirty-nine,
twelve had been at Cornell at one
time or another. Cornell was the alma
mater of the first president of the Uni
versity, Dr. David Starr Jordan.
According to the information in the
front of the book, "one building of
the quad is devoted to the Library,
which has a reading-room accommo
dating 10W students; the Library now
has 8,000 volumes and 3,000 pamph
lets." This Library was in the build
ing now occupied by the School of
Law.
College was cheap in those days.
The writers of the information book
stated that $20 a month would pay
board and room, and there was no
tuition. In 1891 there was no charge
made for heat and light, but tlie fol
lowing year this item was added to
the bills.
And only 559 students were here to
appreciate all that luxury. There were
417 men and 142 women, and applica
tions for admission could be taken in
the summer before the candidate
would be admitted.
