Stanford is still "The Farm."
At least so it would appear to the
uninitiated observer who saw a black
cat run across the stage of the Little
Theatre Tuesday night, interrupting
a lecture by Dr. Ernest M. Patterson
on "Italy's Difficult Task." Dr. Pat
terson had just introduced Mussolini's
program for "less whoopee and more
woppie," when Puss created the di
version.
"I am afraid you lost the force of
Mussolini's remarks," the speaker
continued as chuckles ran through
Hie audience, which up to this point
had listened intently to Professor Pat
terson's address, "but I don't know
whether or not I can compete with
that mewing cat."
Kitty, dazzled by the footlights, ran
behind the curtain apparently to hunt
for' "rittens," which, according to In
structor Albert Walton of the Psych
ology department, are young rats. It i
you call little cats kittens, why not
little rats, rittens?
The professor's next remarks were
punctuated as follows: "Italy lays"
taxes on unmarried men (meow). The
knowledge of birth control is checked 1
(meow, meow). Mussolini has ssjid ■
(meow) 'We must be ready at a mo
ment's notice to mobilize 50,000,000
men (meow, and the kitten reap
peared on stage). The years between
1!):J5-1940 will be a crucial point in
European history. To be an empire
(meow, etc.) . , .
"That cat must go!" With the aid
of some in the audience the lecturer
cornered the obsterperous feline,
picked it up by the nape of the neck,
and transferred it outside through the j
same window by which it entered.
And think that Dr. Patterson, an !
international authority on economic I
questions, will go back to the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, where he is a
member of the faculty, and tell the
students how unsophisticated we are
'way out West on the Stanford Farm!
"Cats actually walk across the stage
in the lecture halls," he will say.
