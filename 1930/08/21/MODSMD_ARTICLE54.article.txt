# PSYCHOLOGIST INVESTIGATES SCIENTIFIC BASES FOR FORMATION OF FRIENDSHIPS
## 
### 
Who are qualified to become
friends? Do the brilliant prefer the
companionship offered by competing
intellectuals? Do the strong associate
with the weak for the purpose of pro
tecting them? Does the introvert seek
the outlet found in the company of
the extrovert?
For over a year Robert G. Bernreu
ter, candidate for the Ph.D. degree in
psychology, has been performing tests
and gathering data in attempting to
determine the basis of friendship, in
order to get the most accurate results,
the young scientist selects carefully
a pair of men between whom a last
bond of friendship is known to exist.
He examines tlieni both carefully with
a "battery" of personality and inter
est tests. One of tlie more outstand
ing of 1 lie former class is the test for
body types, that is, to determine
whether a person is the leptosomic,
slender type; or the pyknic, short
round type.

112 This test for the quality of person-
I a lit y and the evaluation of its results
was first noted by Kretschner, it Ger
-1 man psychiatrist. The interest tests
were similar to those given in voca
tional guidance work, and it is hoped
j that the results will show whether or
i not friends have a majority of inter
j ests in common.
To the present time the results from
j these examinations would indicate
; that the weaker persons physically,
mentally, and emotionally often seek
! ihe protection of the stronger physie-
I ally and mentally and the more stable
j emotionally, and that the more domin
ant glory in towering over the sub
i missive.
By the time the experiment is fin
j ished, Bernreuter hopes to know the
! combination of personality necessary
! for friendship and the conditions un
i der which such a relationship can
; exist. He mentions, however, that it
!is doubtful if synthetic friendships
| can ever be formed.
