# CICERO IN CONFLICT? Webster In Big Wrangle? SPECTATORS WON'T SAY
## 
### 
What were Cicero and Daniel Web
ster arguing about when the tight be
gan? None of the spectators survived,
except the chickens in back of the
bacteriology department, and they re
fused to divulge tlie nature of the
scrap.
That the oratory "Hew" is almost
certain. At the present moment both
orators and several spectators, in eve
ning clothes, are in pieces on the
ground in back of the Museum.
The parties concerned have lain
there since the earthquake in l!t()(j,
and, marble being durable, they may
remain for some time. One marble
bust is labeled with the Latin orator's
name, and the other is claimed, in
large letters, to be the American
speaker. Beside them are the pros
trate figures of several gentlemen,
identity not known, who have been
dissected and scattered until the bare
leet of one have landed below the for
mal evening clothes of another. The
latter combination is not mentioned
in dispatches concerning what the
well-dressed man will wear this year.
Such was the work of the earth
quake in April, 190 G. One building
covered the whole space where the
Museum and the departments of ana
tomy and bacteriology now stand, and
Daniel Webster and Cicero in marble
fought it. out with ruins the size of a
Roman senatorial hall or the Capitol
halls at Washington around them.
