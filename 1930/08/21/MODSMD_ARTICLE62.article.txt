# STATISTICIANS WASTING TIME SAYS LECTURER

"The greatest need today in the use
of formulas for statistical work is a
more careful study of assumptions
and derivations underlying the formu
las used," declared Professor Arthur
L. Rowley of the London School of
Economics during liis lecture yester
day oil tlie "l T se and Abuse of the
Product-Sum Coefficient of Correla
tion."
Too many satisticians are wasting
their time and the attention of others
by making numerical substitutions in
formulas already derived, and are not
trying to devise new formulas to help
solve new problems that arise in our
modern world, he declared.
"However, this fundamental mathe
matical work is beyond the compre
hension of the average satistician and
should be handled by the mathema
tician," Professor Bowley continued.
"Today, formulas have been devised
that will give a better survey of agri
cultural production through the use of
representative selection of crop re
ports than by the old system of
juggling figures to obtain a meaning
less answer known as an average
figure."
