# WILLIS FINISHES SCIENTIFIC BOOK ON AFRICAN TRIP
## Geologist Describes Wonders, Horrors of Congo With Artistic Finesse Advances Theory To Explain Fissure Valleys 
### 
From the depths of the unmapped
African Congo with its merciless
heat, deadly tsetse fly, and lurking
wild animals, Dr. Bailey Willis, pro
fessor emeritus of geology, emerged
to write one of the outstanding non
fiction books of the season, "African
Wanderings of a Geologist'."
Africa, with brilliant colors splashed
on its rugged surface, seared into sub
mission by rays from the tropical sun,
and shackled in the weighted chains
of ignorance and custom, is pictured
by the geologist in the story and de
scription of his lengthy journey
through the heart of darkest Africa.
The scientific value of the work lies
in its explanation of the rift (fissure)
valleys of northern and central Africa.
"The most astounding of these causes
advanced by Dr. Willis is that the
molecular expansion of chemical crys
tal beds when covered with molten
lava, exerts enough force against the
earth' crust upward to cause it to
crack. It was formerly believed that
these rifts were a result of the ten
sion caused by the parting of the
African continent from Asia. The book
will be issued by McGraw-Hill Pub
lishing Company some time in Oc
tober.
