Dr. Albert Lang, acting professor
of education Ibis quarter and dean of
tbe School of Education at Fresno
Sta'te College, gave an informal talk
I Tuesday at an open meeting of Pi
| Lambda Tbeta, national women's edu
j cational society, on the articulation of
| teacher training with the sort of
teaching she will do.
Dr. Lang, in speaking of the com
mon conception of a teacher as being
poorly paid and bound by the whims
of the school board and tlie commun
ity, pointed out that these restrictions
were made at a time when teachers
were usually young and often poorly
trained and inexperienced. He ex
plained that today these restrictions
are not necessary, as the modern
teacher is the product of special train
ing as well as social and educational
experience.
In closing Dr. Lang declared that
tlie gap between the teacher's profes
sional training aiid her actual teach
! ing experience would perhaps best be
I bridged by considering the first year
of teaching as a kind of interneship.
jit is his opinion that institutions for
j the training of teachers should as
i sume some responsibility for the
I supervision and direction of the new
j teacher in her actual teaching.
