## 
### 
Action by the county board of super
visors on the request for county aid
in the flnaneing'of the installation of
| the traffic lights at the intersection
| of El ('amino Real and University ave
i nue will probably be made within the
| next two weeks.
Both the members of the city coun
'cil and the officers of the University
J are of the opinion that the new signal
j should be installed with t lie help of
an appropriation from the county.
The total cost of the lights will be
'about $1800. The supervisors seem to
Ibe in favor of the bill, and Captain
I A. M. Simons, secretary of the local
chamber of commerce, feels sure that
I the county board will make the de
j sired appropriation.
