# WILBUR TO ASK PROBE OF CHARGE
## Justice Department Will Examine Acquiring Of Oil Lands 
### 
WASHINGTON. Sept. .50. Sec
retary Wilbur today asked the Justice
Department to investigate the charges
of Ralph Kellcy of the General Land
office at Denver that efforts were be
ing made bv oil companies t > acquire
oil shale lands in Colorado illegally.
"This department," Wilbur said,
"does not propose to rest on the
charges of misfeasance in connection
with the administration of public
lands. I may repeat that the state
ments he (Mr. Kellcy) made public
did not refer to oil lands but to oil
shale lands; that no single lease or
permit has been issued by this admini
stration to any individual, company or
corporation on these lands, that be
ing in compliance with an executive
order of the President at the start
of this administration."
Secretary Wilbur said he expected
the Justice Department to inquire into
Keller's statements and that it would
give full opportunity to establish any
charges. He added the department
would seek explanation of the "origin
of these reckless and false state
ments."
