# WOMEN'S NEW LOCKOUT REGULATIONS WILL NOT TAKE IMMEDIATE EFFECT
## Former Rules of 10:30 Week Nights and 1:30 Week-Ends Will be in Use Until Conference Holds Meeting To Determine New Lockout Machinery 
### 
ALTHOUGH Hit* new lockout regulations giving 2:30 o'clock late
leaves on the week-end ami a greater number of 11:30 o'clock leaves
during the week have been approved by the Administration and are
included in the handbook they will not ? <> into effect immediately, and
until Conference meets, the old rules of 10:30 o'clock week nights and
1:30 week-ends will be enforced. ( onlerence will meet within two
weeks, according to Betty Alden, Women's president, and at that time
the machinery for carrying out the new regulations will be planned

and that made this Hummer ex
plained.
To Eduafcte Women
Tin iir\v regulations are not in
effect immediately because it was
felt that ;i campaign of education
should be carried on among the
new women, and tiiat would lie ad
visable for Conference to meet and
organize the machinery. Under tin'
new lilies ii will lie necessary for
the houses to have a system of
keys, since the buildings must be
closed in 1:! o'clock on the week
ends.
Freshman women will continue
to have hut two 11:30 leaves per
quarter instead of the three the
new i iili s give, until Conference
decides that the new rules are
ready to be put in effect.
Motoring Rules
Although Conference, spring
quarter, voted to do away with the
special freslnnan regulation—"Kx
cept as a means of conveyance be
tween their homes and the campus
or I'alo Alto and tiie campus, first
quarter freshman women may not
motor off-campus after dark unless
accompanied by another Stanford
woman," it was included in the
handbook this year. It was thought
better to leave the regulation un
changed because of the great
changes made in the regular rules.
Members of Conference who will
take action on the lockout question
art tin- presidents of each living
group, five representatives from
Tioble, one representative from the
unorganized women.

during the week have been approved by the Administration and are
included in the handbook they will not ? <> into effect immediately, and
until Conference meets, the old rules of 10:30 o'clock week nights and
1:30 week-ends will be enforced. ( onlerence will meet within two
weeks, according to Betty Alden, Women's president, and at that time
the machinery for carrying out the new regulations will be planned

and that made this Hummer ex
plained.
To Eduafcte Women
Tin iir\v regulations are not in
effect immediately because it was
felt that ;i campaign of education
should be carried on among the
new women, and tiiat would lie ad
visable for Conference to meet and
organize the machinery. Under tin'
new lilies ii will lie necessary for
the houses to have a system of
keys, since the buildings must be
closed in 1:! o'clock on the week
ends.
Freshman women will continue
to have hut two 11:30 leaves per
quarter instead of the three the
new i iili s give, until Conference
decides that the new rules are
ready to be put in effect.
Motoring Rules
Although Conference, spring
quarter, voted to do away with the
special freslnnan regulation—"Kx
cept as a means of conveyance be
tween their homes and the campus
or I'alo Alto and tiie campus, first
quarter freshman women may not
motor off-campus after dark unless
accompanied by another Stanford
woman," it was included in the
handbook this year. It was thought
better to leave the regulation un
changed because of the great
changes made in the regular rules.
Members of Conference who will
take action on the lockout question
art tin- presidents of each living
group, five representatives from
Tioble, one representative from the
unorganized women.
