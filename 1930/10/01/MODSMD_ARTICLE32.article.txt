# GRIDMEN WORK HARD FOR TILT WITH BRONCOS
## Warner Will Polish Cards Offense This Week; Broncs Strong SQUAD TO BE CUT SOON 
### Len Kullman 
Confronted by the twin specters
of a cut in tile varsity squad and
a lough game with the Santa (Mara
Broncos coming up on Saturday,
work mid plenty of it is the pre
scription Coach "Pop" Warner has
ordered for gridiron men this
week. Although the 1930 model of
the Big Red Machine has mowed
down the West Coast Army and the
Olympic Club by the scores of 152-0
and IS-0 respectively, much polish
must be given to the offensive
work of the team before Warner
will be satisfied.
That the Broncos, always a thorn
in Stanford's side, are no set-up is
amply proved by their showing
against California Saturday. "Clip
per" Smith's men led the Bears for
three quarters of the game, and
had the Santa damns more re
serve strength, the margin of Blue
and Gold victory would have been
much smaller than the two touch
downs the final score showed.
Warner will undoubtedly make
his final cut in the squad thi <;
week, and in all probabilities it. will
be announced today or tomorrow.
With the smaller group to attend
to, practice will move along more
thoroughly than has been possible
during the opening sessions. Ii is
expected that between fifty and
fifty-five will be retained on the
squad, the balance of the men
being turned over to the Grays.
Passing Weak
Perhaps the most outstanding
weakness of the Cardinals as re
vealed by the early season games
has been the inconsistent results
secured by the use of the lateral
passes. Following the Santa Clara
clash, the Warnermen will depart
for Minneapolis either Monday or
Tuesday of next * week, hence all
effort is being made this week to
iron out the rough spots in team
play.
Scrimmage between third- and
fourth-string teams took most of
Warner's attention Monday eve
ning, while last night secret prac
tice saw few admitted to the prac
tice field. Scrimmage between as
sorted elevens found Warner act
ing as play-caller for one or an
other of the teams during the
course of the evening.
Line bucks and passes are the
plays Pop seems to he stressing,
and the results of the work will be
on display Saturday. The vigilance
of the managers was the feature
of the practice, one shutting the
mer Card football player and sliot
Kate in the faceo 112 A 1 Forster, for-
I putter, while anothey loured tit"
j fence inspecting knot-holes for pry
| ing eyes.
Two Crippled
lint two varsity men watched
| practice from the sidelines. Mike
j Reynolds, tackle, who has been on
I crutches for the past three weeks
j due to an injured foot, and Bill
Bardin, guard, were the sole squad
( members not in uniform. Bardin is
expected to be out for practice to
j morrow, while Reynolds will be in
i capacitated for another week or
j two.
Four tall poles added to the prac
tice field within the past few days
indicate longer hours for Card
practice sessions. The B.A.C.
, has just spent $3500 to illuminate
! half of Pop Warner's sanctuary,
| and sixteen lights are to be in
j stalled. Four lights will be mounted
I on each of the poles, and sixteen
1000-watt globes are required.
Night Practicc
Work under these lights is ex-
I pected to prepare the Redshirts to
la certain extent for the night game
scheduled with F.C.B.A.'s Bruins
in the Los Angeles Coliseum on
October 31, and it is a foregone
conclusion that the lights will be
much in use before the I'niversify
of Southern California, the I'niver-
I sity of California, and the Dart
mouth College games.
