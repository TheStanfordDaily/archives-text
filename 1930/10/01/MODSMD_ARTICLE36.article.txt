# "THE INSTITOOT GIRLS" PROCRASTINATE
## 
### 
Strenuous endeavor by Stanford women and The Daii.y was
brought to a happy conclusion last spring quarter when the new
lockout regulations were approved by Women's Conference and
the I niversity administration. Two-thirty o'clock late leaves on
week-ends and a greater number of 1 1 :30 o'clock leaves during the
week were provided, giving to members of the A.W'.S. that freedom
from ton rigid restraint and regulation which is their right as uni
versity women.
Last spring the committee which drew up the new set of regula
tions and presented them to Women's Conference also planned ma
chinery for the carrying out of the revised rules; details were
supposed to have been worked out during the summer. It was
1 bought that the new rules would be in effect when the present
quarter opened. Cut no, the old 10:30 o'clock week night—l:3o
o'clock week-end system of restrictions is now in force and will be
for one and possibly two more weeks, freshman women must leant
the old set of regulations and then, following a meeting of Women's
Conference within the next two weeks, promptly forget them and
learn a new set. Women who were here Inst year must also observe
the old rules until after the meeting of Women's Conference.
It is quite likely that the machinery for the operation of the new
regulations must be approved by Women's Conference before it is
] nit into effect. I Wit is it necessary that such action be delayed for
two weeks? Is it fair to the new women to burden them with two
ets of social regulations during their first few weeks at Stanford?
So long did Stanford women campaign for more lenient lockout
rules that it seems hardly possible that machinery for their opera
lion was not worked out months ago. machinery which could be
approved and put into use during the first week of the present
quarter.
Regardless of the cause, the delay is unnecessary and seems to
he jnst a little more "red tape' to hinder Stanford women in their
attempt to do away with the feudal restrictiveness ot the lockout
vstem.

tions and presented them to Women's Conference also planned ma
chinery for the carrying out of the revised rules; details were
supposed to have been worked out during the summer. It was
1 bought that the new rules would be in effect when the present
quarter opened. Cut no, the old 10:30 o'clock week night—l:3o
o'clock week-end system of restrictions is now in force and will be
for one and possibly two more weeks, freshman women must leant
the old set of regulations and then, following a meeting of Women's
Conference within the next two weeks, promptly forget them and
learn a new set. Women who were here Inst year must also observe
the old rules until after the meeting of Women's Conference.
It is quite likely that the machinery for the operation of the new
regulations must be approved by Women's Conference before it is
] nit into effect. I Wit is it necessary that such action be delayed for
two weeks? Is it fair to the new women to burden them with two
ets of social regulations during their first few weeks at Stanford?
So long did Stanford women campaign for more lenient lockout
rules that it seems hardly possible that machinery for their opera
lion was not worked out months ago. machinery which could be
approved and put into use during the first week of the present
quarter.
Regardless of the cause, the delay is unnecessary and seems to
he jnst a little more "red tape' to hinder Stanford women in their
attempt to do away with the feudal restrictiveness ot the lockout
vstem.
