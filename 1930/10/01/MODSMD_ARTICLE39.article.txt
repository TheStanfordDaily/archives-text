YOUNG SINNERS—Curran Thea

The plot, if a very simple series
of ideas may he so named, moves
slowly through the first act, when
i interest, is quite suddenly aroused
by the entrance of the hard-fisted
Irish "reformer" who beats his
headstrong young millionaire into
physical obedience but not sub

fortable cabin in the Adirondacks,
the sets used in the play are effec

Her occasional lapses from char
acter should smooth themselves
out after a few performances of

SWEET MAN—By Gilmore Millen.
New York. 1930.
Hjgh-yaller sweet man, gambler,
drinker, ex-convict John Henry,
bastard son of it white cotton
plantation agent, in this glamour
ous novel by Gilmore Millen, Los
Angeles newspaper man, wanders
his thirty years in brutal, vivid
black man's land, from the side of
his first girl in a Mississippi field
Ito Memphis honky-tonks, from
Beale street to Hollywood, and
there finally to death by his own
hand at the side of his first white
1 mistress.
Women were John Henry's life.
New love was to him the eternal
song for which wandering and li
quor and crap-shooting, blues and
work and bright clothes, were only
#

the accompaniment until he died.
Murder was done for love of him
when Helena Hid, whose home
was a Memphis house, with tierce
passion and delight cut French
Cora to death before a Beale street
bar. Love killed him, and the
wealthy Hollywood girl whose lover
he had been.
Married to the only girl of all
his scores for whom he ever felt
any real affection, John Henry
left her in Mississippi, traveled for
ten years, always planning to re
turn. Then he met her in Los An
geles' Central avenue black belt,
after she had borne a son to his
own father. Back to her at last he
started, but it was too late.
Milieu, a Southerner, has made
his book a dark kaleidoscope filled
with cocaine-sniffing barrel-house
women, killers, plantation men,
blues singers, crap-shooters, and
lynchers. In it throbs the great
black heart of America's Africa,
strange, vital, elemental as mur
der. —J- McJ.
THE SEA WOLF—New Stanford
Theatre.
The Sea Wolf is an adventure
story of life on the high seas, it
is an impossible story of impos
sible people, a story gruesome and
unpleasant in detail, and yet on£
which is interesting from begin
ning to end.
Milton Sills gives a good per
formance in the leading role as a
man who, born in the gutter, has
trained himself until he considers
himself a super-man, powerful in
mind and body. Raymond Hacked
is convincing as a weak character.
Jane Keith fills the role of heroine.
The plot is full of action. Milton
Sills shanghies Raymond Hackett,
whom the girl follows on board.
The climax comes with a fight at
sea; the girl and the man find
shelter after drifting for hours in
an open boat, and Milton Sills has
his eyes burned out by the ship's
cook he had harmed.

THE SEA WOLF—New Stanford

The Sea Wolf is an adventure
story of life on the high seas, it
is an impossible story of impos

unpleasant in detail, and yet on£
which is interesting from begin

Milton Sills gives a good per
formance in the leading role as a
man who, born in the gutter, has
trained himself until he considers
himself a super-man, powerful in
mind and body. Raymond Hacked
is convincing as a weak character.
Jane Keith fills the role of heroine.
The plot is full of action. Milton
Sills shanghies Raymond Hackett,
whom the girl follows on board.
The climax comes with a fight at
sea; the girl and the man find
shelter after drifting for hours in
an open boat, and Milton Sills has
his eyes burned out by the ship's
cook he had harmed.

THE SEA WOLF—New Stanford
Theatre.
The Sea Wolf is an adventure
story of life on the high seas, it
is an impossible story of impos
sible people, a story gruesome and
unpleasant in detail, and yet on£
which is interesting from begin
ning to end.
Milton Sills gives a good per
formance in the leading role as a
man who, born in the gutter, has
trained himself until he considers
himself a super-man, powerful in
mind and body. Raymond Hacked
is convincing as a weak character.
Jane Keith fills the role of heroine.
The plot is full of action. Milton
Sills shanghies Raymond Hackett,
whom the girl follows on board.
The climax comes with a fight at
sea; the girl and the man find
shelter after drifting for hours in
an open boat, and Milton Sills has
his eyes burned out by the ship's
cook he had harmed.
YOUNG SINNERS—Curran Thea
tre, San Francisco.
Flaunting their independence,
typical of the new age, the young
sinners high step through a fast
moving sophisticated hit.
When stopped by such obstacles
, as shocked parents, accepted con
ventions, the juvenile prodigals as
sert their self-sufficiency and con
vince tile rest of us that it's genu
' ine.
The plot, if a very simple series
of ideas may he so named, moves
slowly through the first act, when
i interest, is quite suddenly aroused
by the entrance of the hard-fisted
Irish "reformer" who beats his
headstrong young millionaire into
physical obedience but not sub
jection, and finally wins his admi
ration and complete trust.
From the attractive Palm Beach
winter home to the almost too-com
fortable cabin in the Adirondacks,
the sets used in the play are effec
tive without being strikingly dif
ferent, and snow that fails to dis
turb the band-box composure of a
j society matron, do not detract from
the feeling of sincerity.
i Marian Marsh is a lovely leading
, lady-sinner, although a bit mature
'for even a sophisticated seventeen.
Her occasional lapses from char
acter should smooth themselves
out after a few performances of
the idav. John Harrow's repre
sentation of a cynical and com
pletely purposeless youngster,
spoiled but really fine, is excellent.
With the exception of a few rough
edges to be polished off the minor
character parts, the cast is good.
The play is long, but well worth
seeing. M. L. J.
SWEET MAN—By Gilmore Millen.
New York. 1930.
Hjgh-yaller sweet man, gambler,
drinker, ex-convict John Henry,
bastard son of it white cotton
plantation agent, in this glamour
ous novel by Gilmore Millen, Los
Angeles newspaper man, wanders
his thirty years in brutal, vivid
black man's land, from the side of
his first girl in a Mississippi field
Ito Memphis honky-tonks, from
Beale street to Hollywood, and
there finally to death by his own
hand at the side of his first white
1 mistress.
Women were John Henry's life.
New love was to him the eternal
song for which wandering and li
quor and crap-shooting, blues and
work and bright clothes, were only
#

the accompaniment until he died.
Murder was done for love of him
when Helena Hid, whose home
was a Memphis house, with tierce
passion and delight cut French
Cora to death before a Beale street
bar. Love killed him, and the
wealthy Hollywood girl whose lover
he had been.
Married to the only girl of all
his scores for whom he ever felt
any real affection, John Henry
left her in Mississippi, traveled for
ten years, always planning to re
turn. Then he met her in Los An
geles' Central avenue black belt,
after she had borne a son to his
own father. Back to her at last he
started, but it was too late.
Milieu, a Southerner, has made
his book a dark kaleidoscope filled
with cocaine-sniffing barrel-house
women, killers, plantation men,
blues singers, crap-shooters, and
lynchers. In it throbs the great
black heart of America's Africa,
strange, vital, elemental as mur
der. —J- McJ.
