Here we all are, back at the
daily grind again. Has anyone
among us yet perfected a patent
device that keeps the alarm clock
buzzing until the buzzee is actu
ally on his way to the eight o'clock
class?
New students and interested par
' ents are reported as being tremen
dously impressed by the present
entrance to Palm Drive. It's taken
three months 10 think about tear
ing up the pavement then* and al
the P. 0., and now that we're all
back to give the "Men at Work"
a big hand, they're tearing, with
much dust and mud, to boot.
i What with a new hospital and a
new women's gym and one com
pletely transformed fraternity
| house, all at once, it's hard to
recognize the place. Five hundred
women students may become live
hundred athletes, and then where
will Stanford tradition be?
'Most everyone seems to be on
, deck, but there is a different at
-1 mosphere, in places. The "big white
barn on the hill," for instance was
occupied by a group of kindergart
i qners during the summer. The
question is: Was it or was il not
| a relief to the rest of the people
living on the hill?
According to reports from the
Registrar's office, more than one
hundred and eighty new women
are registered in Stanford lhis
quarter. By the law of averages,
there should b< how many who
aren't here just, to make A's?
Which reminds us that fro hmen
in Encnia have always been grate
' fill for a few helpful hint;; about
queening campus girls. For one
thing, stay out. of r; rive of flower
pots when you join the nnnaul pa
jama parade. The girls at Kohle are
quite, oh quite, donn si ic.
Then there's the little mailer of
the president's reception. Beware
| of walking underneath those .Japa
nese lanterns on the lawn. The
light is romantically misleading,
and you're terribly apt to find your
self pledged to eternal service in a
girl you don't even know, except
for her eyes and her voice and
she MUST have good sense, hemp
at Stanford.
