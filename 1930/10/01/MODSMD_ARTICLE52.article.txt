A new coaching device is being used at Harvard to train centers
in fast, accurate passing. It was devised by Vic Kenr.ard, Harvard
punting coach, shown watching Roger Hallowell, center. When the
ball is snapped it releases a time bell. It is up to the back to get his
punt off between the time the ball is passed and the bsll rings, two
seconds.
