# Freshman Football Squad Gives Promise Of Strength
## BABES HOLD BACK SACRAMENTO J.C. IN HARD CONTEST Dope Upset When Cards Battle Opponents To 13-13 Tie 
### 
Displaying unexpected strength,;
Coach Itahhit Bradshaw's freshman j
football team played a powerful |
Sacramento Junior College eleven j
to a standstill last Saturday in the [
preliminary game to the Varsity-j
Olympic Club battle, and emerged i
with a 13-13 tie, showing promise
of being one of the best Babe i
squads to wear the Cardinal in re- ;
cent years.
Doped to win, the J.C. boys j
seemed more experienced and were ;
more consistent, but the Cards had j
occasional streaks of power which |
were sufficiently effective to offset. |
their opponents' steadiness. (Jap- j
tain Donadio of the Jaysee was j
the shining light of his squad and
proved the only scoring weapon of
the Sacramenans, as he made both
touchdowns.
Maentz Is Good
Maentz, a Hashy halfback from
Culver Military Academy, was Ihe
big star of the frosh backfiehl and
looks like a future greal of Ihe
Warner varsity, lie is a shifty run
ner who keeps his feet well and
picks his holes accurately, with re
sulting gains of a substantial na
ture. Maentz did most of the pass
ing and also acted as safety man.
His passing was not sensational
Saturday but would have brought
in good returns if the Card ends
had been able to hold the ball
when it dropped into their arms.
Lipscomb at fullback and Hill
man al quarter are other cogs in
the Babe backfiehl, Hillman being
a brother of Harry Hillman, War
ner's big varsity quarterback.
The freshman line opened a num
ber of fine holes on offense against
Sacramento at times and looked
quite powerful in spots. There were
other moments, however, when the
whole team looked like a grammar
school eleven, especially in de
fending against passes or when
called upon to exercise individual
judgment.
Nevertheless, despite all the
lapses which the boys of '34 com
mitted, they did exhibit many
hopeful signs, and as the season
progresses and they become more
familiar with the Warner system,
Cardinal rooters may expect to see
a rapidly improving team and one
that should give the strongest year
ling aggregations a lough battle.

called upon to exercise individual
judgment.
Nevertheless, despite all the
lapses which the boys of '34 com

hopeful signs, and as the season
progresses and they become more
familiar with the Warner system,
Cardinal rooters may expect to see
a rapidly improving team and one
that should give the strongest year
