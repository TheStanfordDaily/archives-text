EX-GRAYS
From that school of hard foot
ball coached IjJ/ Murray Cudde
baek and Don Robesky, the Stan
ford Grays, "Pop" Warner has
drawn no less than eight men
whom he has seen lit to give their
baptism of fire before the season
is two games old. These eight ex-
Grays arc I)oub and Colvin, ends;
Grey, tackle; Hand and Hunt,
nard:;; and Hardy, Lambert, and
Wilson, halves.
Hill Doub, a tackle during his
Frosh and Gray years, was shifted
to end by the Old Fox during
spring practice. Although playing
a position comparatively new to
him, Doub has served warning to
one and all that his blond thatch
will be in the midst of entirely too
many plays to suit opposing
elevens, Lacking a little polish at
his new post, Doub makes up for
his slight deficiency by a world of
light, and no mean pass-catching
ability.
Don Colvin, the other flank
man with a Gray past, moves
his 190 pounds about the field
with more celerity than is or
dinarily seen with such bulk.
Besides possessing the fastest
di ive on the field, Colvin covers
punts like a ball-hcund. While
both newcomers to the squad
suffer by comparison with the
neat perfection of Phil Neill's
play, they reveal unmistakable
talent.
Mig George Grey (so dubbed to
distinguish him from Bigger Dick
Rogue), besides filling a tackle
In rili handily, possesses an addi
tional and highly valuable asset
an educated toe. This broad lad
boots the pigskin through the
" loss liars with a dexterity culti
vated hy practice and the able
tutelage of a past master in the
arl, Murray Cuddeback.
Hand and Hunt, the alliterative
guards with sombre histories, saw
service in both the Army and
Olympic Club clashes. Hand held
down an end job with the Grays
last year, but added poundage led
to his altered status. Speed plus
determination sum up the red
bead. llnnt, who has not been as
conspicuous as Hand since lie lias
played less in the opening games,
nevertheless will force the veter
ans to produce before he can be
kept on the bench for part of the
games lo come.
Hardy, Wilson, and Lambert
are a trio of halfbacks which
any coach would welcome.
Chunky, spunky Spud Hardy
furnished most of the thrills
in the first half of the Army
encounter, and his forty-yard
punt return to a touchdown
against the Winged O, al
though cancelled by an offside
linesman, indicate Hardy's pos
sibilities. Phil Wilson, contri
butor of a touchdown against
the Soldiers, scintillated on de
fense as well as offense in the
season's debut and adds to
Glenn Warner's growing list of
backs. Tom Lambert's steady
play will continue to be noticed
by bleacher coaches as the
games roll by.
Add the names of Ernie Caddel,
"Dusly" Allen, and Bill Laird to
the li.si of veterans and ex-Grays,
for these three men have a lean
and hungry look whenever back
held posts are mentioned. Caddel,
wiili the possible exception of
Rothert, is without a doubt the
fastest fullback in moleskins on
the Farm. And Ernie is going
places this year, whether or no
the line opens holes for him, for
his drive is not lo be denied yard
age. Caddel': punting, too, is some
thing to be reckoned with.
While "Dusty" Allen is wearing
Herb Fleishhacker's old number,
he more ch.sely resembles Chuck
than Herb in his style
of play. Rugged, backing up the
line like a veteran, and hitting for
his share of the gains, "Dusty" has
arrived. Little Bill Laird, the last
of the triumvirate, is the Albie
Booth of the Redshirt ranks.
Bouncing, bobbing Bill packs punts
hack ui> the field and slices off
tackle in ground-gaining fashion to
convince spectators they are watch
ing a rising Red luminary. L. K.
