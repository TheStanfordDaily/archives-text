# JAPAN TO SIGN LONDON NAVAL TREATY TODAY
## Unanimous Vote Of Privy Council Secures Ratification PACT LIGHTENS TAXES 
### 
TOKYO, Oct. 1. (Associated
Pres.,J Japan today followed the
lead of the United States and rati
fied tin' London Naval Treaty.
The Emperor Hirohito will affix
his signature to the treaty probably
tomorow and the gold seal of i,he
Empire will testify to his action.
Late this month the ambassador to
Great Britain, Tsuneo Matsudaira,
will receive it and formally deposit
it with the British Government.
Ratification was accomplished by
unanimous vote of the privy coun
cil, which in it.; recommendation to
the Emperor placed upon Premier
HamaguchiV government the re
sponsibility for the success of the
pact. The Council said:
''Relying upon the government's
pledges that it assumes full re
sponsibility for executing an effi
cient naval replenishment program
and at the same time lightening the
nation's taxation'burdens, the coun
cil deems it right that the Emperor
ratify the treaty."'
Today's council meeting lasted
two hours and a half and was given
over to the report of its special
treaty committee, presented by
Count Miyoji Ito, the chairman, and
to Premier Hamaguchi's presenta
tion of the government's arguments
on behalf of the treaty.
Pact Causes Friction
The treaty had been the cause
of serious disagreement between the
cabinet and the navy general staff,
which insisted the 350,000.000 yen
budget by the government under
the treaty was 100,000,000 yen under
the navy's requirements for replace
ments and extension of aviation.
This split led to the resignation
early in June of Admiral Kato, chief
of the navy general staff. The resig
nation was hailed as a government
victory. There was no hint of this
trouble, however, in the privy coun
cil's formal advice today to the
overeign. The government's dual
pledge, however, was taken by ob
servers as indicative of the lines
along which the battle between the
c abient and the general staff may be
expected to continue, even after
ratification.
Only the action of India and the
Irish Free State now is awaited to
make the three-power treaty ef
fective, but it is expected King
George V of Great Britain will be
enabled to sign the document soon
after the Irish Dail Eireann con
venes November 19.
