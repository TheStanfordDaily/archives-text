# NEW GRADE POINT SYSTEM TO HAVE ONE EXTRA POINT
## Revised Plan To Reveal Relative Standing Of Students 
### 
Great agitation has been caused
anion?.-, ' udents on the campus by
vague rumors ol' a change in the
••rade point system. It really is not
as drastic as it seems.
The new plan will not affect the
famous Stanford tradition — the
bawl-out. The purpose of the bawl
out is to indicate the excess of
Wades above a C average, or—as
many have found- the grades that
hill below. Averages in the bawl
out will be indicated as in the past.
The bawl-out will be put on sale
on approximately October 18.
The revised grade point system
will not directly affect the student
but will facditate office records. As
before a C average is required for
graduation. On the quarterly re
ports the points will be given as
follows: A, 4 points; B, 3; C, 2;
JJ, I: and 0 for condition, failure, or
withdrawal. Thus it is now neces
sary to have twice as many grade
points a: registered units in order
to graduate.
Old ■ rade points will not be trans
(rii:od to the new system but will
be indicated on office records.
The chief advantage of the new
system, according to Mrs. C. A.
Huston, secretary oi the scholarship
committee, is that ihe old quarter
count system will be abolished. In
stead the grade points can be count
ed io indicate . student's standing
; the new system gives an extra
point for eve .y unit. It also means
that the cliff* rence between a D and
a minus will now be shown.
Any student who desires a fur
ther explanation of the grading
should ::o to 'Vlrs. Huston, who will
gladly explain it.
