# GUN SMUGGLING IS PART OF ARTIST'S COLORFUL HISTORY

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. I.—From
gun-running for Irish Nationalists
to the quiet life of a landscape
painter is the history of Captain G.
Drummond-Fish, M.8.E., who is
showing water colors at the East-
West gallery in San Francisco.
Captain Drummond-Fish is pow
erful, silver-haired, and sunburned
"like a boiled carrot," as he de
scribes himself. His life has been
one of action, and yet he exhibits
misty landscaoes.
He smuggled guns for the Nation
alists in 1914, at the same time as
the Ulsterites were also gun-run
ning only a few miles up the coast.
At the outbreak of die World War
Ue enlisted with the British.
After being wounded at Gallipoli
and invalided home, he slipped off
again to Ireland, where he remained
all the rest of the war.
"Ireland was much more danger
ous than France," says Captain
Drummond-Fish. "In France you
at least knew who your enemies
were. In Dublin, a man could walk
along the street with a revolver in
each hand, keeping a lookout in all
directions—and then someone would
drop a bomb on him from a win
dow!"
He has found much beautiful
scenery to paint in California. He
condemns, however, the commer
cialization of Yosemite by the build
ing of- motion picture halls and
dance pavilions, "Of course they
can't really ruin the grandeur of iL,
but they do their best," is the com
plaint.
"Universities? I don't know any
thing about your American schools,
but in England we say we can al
ways tell a graduate of one or two
big 'Varsities. An Oxford man thinks
he owns the earth. A Cambridge
man doesn't care a damn who owns
it!"
