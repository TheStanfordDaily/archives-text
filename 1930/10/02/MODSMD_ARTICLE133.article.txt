# NUMEROUS CASES OF SPIDER POISONING ON MEDICAL RECORDS
## 
### 
Numerous cases of spider poison
ing. some having fatal results, have
been reported throughout Califor
nia. The spider nicknamed the
"black widow," because of the cus
tom of eating its mate, is considered
the only poisonous species in the
United States.
The "black widow" builds its web
in dimly lighted places where it is
not likely to be disturbed. It is
found in corners, rafters, and under
the floors of sheds, and in places
least, frequented by the public.
Dr. Robert Legge, University of
California physician, remarks that
spider poisoning has become a new
phase of infection, previously un
recognized in the medical world.
The original symptoms, after a
sharp stinging bite, are acute oains
in the region of the surface bitten;
subsequent muscle contraction, in
addition to nausea, cold perspiration
and difficult breathing. Misinformed
physicians have, in some cases, per
formed stomach operations to find
that a spider has been the insti
gator of the disturbance.
