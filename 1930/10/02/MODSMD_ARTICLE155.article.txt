WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (Associ
te I Press). —The annual expendi
ture for intoxicants in the United
States was placed today at $2,848,-
000,000 by the association against
the prohibition amendment which
said this figure "exceeds the most
iiberal estimate of what we would
have been spending if the Eigh
t» mill Amendment never had been
enacted."
This conclusion was announced in
a pamphlet entitled "docs prohi
bi.ion pay?" which the association
said was compiled as the result of
!o months' research work by statis
ticians and political economists.
The report challenged claims that
rational prohibition had increased
the productivity of workers.
"The increased output of workers
can be accounted for," the report
explained, "by the increased use of
power, improved machinery, mass
production, personnel management
and similar factors which are cjuitc
outside the control of the individual
worker.
