# MUSEUM RE-ASSEMBLES SKELETON OF DINOSAUR TO CORRECT SEMBLANCE
## Prehistoric Reptile Extends Over Seventy-Five Feet in Length, Exceeding All Other Specimens But One; Head Remodeled in Plaster 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1. (Associated Press) -The super-size decapitated
dinosaur dug out of a sandstone ledge in northeastern Utah seven
years ago has almost been restored to the correct semblance of his own
skeleton at the National Museum. Within a few weeks, four or five lesser
specimens will be moved out of the honor spot near the front door in
Dinosaur Hall to make room for his 75-foot length.
Only one other known dinosaur exceeds him in size. That is the great
dinosaur of Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, to whom the newly assembled

dinosaur here owes his head.
The protecting Utah rock ledge
ended too soon to take good care
of the dinosaur, and his head, to
gether with 22 or 23 feet of his neck,
had been knocked off, somewhere
down the ages.
"But we were in luck!" jubilated
Curator C. W. Gilmore. "Carnegie
had made plaster casts of all the
bones of its dinosaur to send copies
to Europe, South America, and
Mexico. All we had to do was order
the missing head and neck from
them."
Aside from the lost head and a
mi::sing 10 or 12 feet of tail, the
gigantic prehistoric skeleton, with
his great shoulder blades, his im
pressive femurs, his heavy toes, was
in an excellent state of preserva
tion.
Back in 1923, at Dinosaur Nation
al Park, Utah, five men spent five
months digging him out.
They shipped to Washington 51,-
000 pounds of prehistoric science in
the raw state. This has since been
refined down to 2.000 pounds of
shapely bones by three skilled dino
saur chippers, cutters, and polish
ers, N. H. Boss, T. J. Horn, and
J. M. Barrett. They have been
workmen at the dinosaur trade from
20 to 30 years, and could plaster
cast a missing part with precision.
It is necessary to erect a high
framework of shape iron supports
for each heavcy individual petrified
bone while the skeleton is being put
together.

the missing head and neck from
them."
Aside from the lost head and a
mi::sing 10 or 12 feet of tail, the
gigantic prehistoric skeleton, with
his great shoulder blades, his im
pressive femurs, his heavy toes, was
in an excellent state of preserva
tion.
Back in 1923, at Dinosaur Nation
al Park, Utah, five men spent five
months digging him out.
They shipped to Washington 51,-
000 pounds of prehistoric science in
the raw state. This has since been
refined down to 2.000 pounds of
shapely bones by three skilled dino
saur chippers, cutters, and polish
ers, N. H. Boss, T. J. Horn, and
J. M. Barrett. They have been
workmen at the dinosaur trade from
20 to 30 years, and could plaster
cast a missing part with precision.
It is necessary to erect a high
framework of shape iron supports
for each heavcy individual petrified
bone while the skeleton is being put
together.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1. (Associated Press) -The super-size decapitated
dinosaur dug out of a sandstone ledge in northeastern Utah seven
years ago has almost been restored to the correct semblance of his own
skeleton at the National Museum. Within a few weeks, four or five lesser
specimens will be moved out of the honor spot near the front door in
Dinosaur Hall to make room for his 75-foot length.
Only one other known dinosaur exceeds him in size. That is the great
dinosaur of Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, to whom the newly assembled

dinosaur here owes his head.
The protecting Utah rock ledge
ended too soon to take good care
of the dinosaur, and his head, to
gether with 22 or 23 feet of his neck,
had been knocked off, somewhere
down the ages.
"But we were in luck!" jubilated
Curator C. W. Gilmore. "Carnegie
had made plaster casts of all the
bones of its dinosaur to send copies
to Europe, South America, and
Mexico. All we had to do was order
the missing head and neck from
them."
