# LAST YEAR'S ENCINA INHABITANTS TO GET REBATE ON BREAKAGE FEE
## 
### 
Refunds amounting to as much
as $14 will be doled out to last
year's inhabitants of Encina Hall
ne::t Monday and Tuesday, October
sixth and seventh, at the Encina
Ilall oflice from eight to five o'clock,
according to word received yester
day from the accounting depart
ment of the University. Auditor Ir
win stated that refunds in excess of
$4 will be given to freshmen in
habitants of Encina Hall, the money
representing the surplus remaining
in the breakage fee account. The
other refund amounting to about
$10 per person represents the sur
plus of the boarding cost.
Breakage expense has been re
duced by $1500 during the past
year, Irwin stated, due to the fact
that students now get a direct re
fund oi the surplus of the initial
deposit. Formerly the University
chiii".the stud >nts $1.50 per quar
ter for breakage. The surplus was
put into Encina (Tub Treasury and

I any dcficit was paid by the Uni
versity. Now the deposit is $10 a
year and any surplus that exists
goes back to the student instead of
the Encina Club treasury; hence
the freshmen are more in earnest
about preventing breakage.
j The board refund has been pos
j sible because of the drop in com
modity prices and savings effected
at the Encina Dining Hall. Irwin
added that the board refund will
not be given to members of the En
cina eating clubs but only to the
students eating at Encina Commons
proper. Proportionate refunds will
be made to those that have already
received refunds on account of sick
ness or for other causes.
Checks will be mailed by the
auditing department to students en
titled to the refund who are not in
school this quarter. Students now
in school are urged to call promptly
for their refunds at the Encina of-
fice on Monday or Tuesday.
