GENEVA, Switzerland, Oct. 1 (/P).
—A rap at high tariff countries was
taken before the League of Nations
assembly today by the French min
ister of commerce, Pierre Etienne
Flandin.
Flandin was speaking on the re
port of the economic committee
which recommended various meth
ods of concerted action to relieve the
world economic depression. He ex
pressed misgivings at the attitude
<-112 Canada and other overseas tariff
countries in abstaining from collab
orating with a concerted movement
to lower trade barriers.
"You cannot advocate an open
door »'hile keeping your own door
ciosc !," said M. Flandin. "It has been
forgotten ihat in order to buy you
have to sell. It would be disastrous
if we substituted for military im
perialism an economic imperialism
which might be far worse."
Womsii's Nationality
Efforts of organized women,
haded by Alice Paul, of New York,
to reopen (he question of the na
tionality of married women, suf
fered a check in the assembly judi
cial committee.
The women opposed the nation
ality convention concluded at the
Hague this year—which the United
Stpie; did not sign—and through
Oi ;tes Ferrada, Cuban ambassador
to Washington, presented a resolu
tion asking the assembly to declare
the whole question of women's na
tionality reopened for fresh study.
Miss Paul and her supporters
maintained such action would nul
lify the Hague convention, which
1 as not yet received any ratifica
tion.
