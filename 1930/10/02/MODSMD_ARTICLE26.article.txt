# WARNER LEAVES 52 VARSITY MEN ON FINAL SQUAD
## Secret Practice Ordered As Largest Card Team Starts Grind FOUR FROM YEARLINGS 
### Len Kullmann 
Selecting a squad of 52 men, the
largest he has ever carried, Coach
Pop Warner last night made his
final cut in the 1930 Stanford foot
ball team. Thirteen ends, eight,
tackles, four centers, five quarter
backs, nine halfbacks, and four full
backs comprise the chosen group.
Warner's list is: left end—Nei 11,
K. Albertson, Colvin, Pike, Craig,
Tyler; left tackle—Bogue, G. Grey,
Burke, Oliver; loft guard—Reiser,
Hand, Hulen, McLeod; center—Tay
lor, M. Albertson, Quirk, Marks;
right guard—Bardin, Dawson, Hunt,
Dohrmann, Kite; right tackle—Cap
tain Tandy, Ehrhorn, Laßorde, N.
Grey; right end—Doub, Bush, Whit
tenau, Walker, Clark, Tampke, Pi
ver.
Quarterback: Hillman, Winnek,
Allen, Baker, Targhetta; left half
back — MofTatt, Rintala, Hardy,
Laird, Campbell; right halfback
Caglieri, Clark, Wilson, Lambert;
fullback—Rothert, Simpkins, Caddel,
and Gilbert.
The '33 freshman team contributed
four men to the squad in the persons
of Ted Kite, guard, Nelson Grey and
Henri Laßorde, takles, and "Red"
Targhetta, quarterback. Last year's
Gray team furnishes four ends, two
tackles, three guards, a center, three
halfbacks, and a fullback. The bal
ance of the squad is composed of
last year's personnel, plus men who
were not out for football a year
ago.
Secret Practice
Last night secret practice was
again in order, and with the smaller
squad divided up into four full
teams Pop put the boys through
pratice without a scrimmage. Run
ning with Perry Taylor at center
were Pete Heiser and Ray Dawson,
guards; Captain Ray Tandy and
Dick Bogue, tackles; Joe Bush and
K. Albertson, ends; Hillman at quar
ter; Clark and MofTatt at halves;
and Simpkins at fullback.
Mar Albertson at center worked
with Hand and Kite, guards; George
Grey and "Chuck" Ehrhorn, tackles;
Neill and Doub, ends; Allen, quar
terback; Caglieri and Rintala, half
backs, and Rothert, fullback. Two
other elevens of varying makeup
were also occupied running through
plays during most of the afternoon.
Bill Bardin, first string guard, did
not engage in active practice during
the course of the afternoon, but oc
cupied himself with booting drop
kicks through the uprights with n
fair amount of success. While prac
tically recovered from his injuries
sustained in the Olympic Club
game, he will probably not see serv
ice in the clash with Santa Clara
Saturday. Aside from Bardin, all
the members of the squad seemed
to be in fine fettle.

terback; Caglieri and Rintala, half
backs, and Rothert, fullback. Two
other elevens of varying makeup
were also occupied running through
plays during most of the afternoon.
Bill Bardin, first string guard, did
not engage in active practice during
the course of the afternoon, but oc
cupied himself with booting drop
kicks through the uprights with n
fair amount of success. While prac
tically recovered from his injuries
sustained in the Olympic Club
game, he will probably not see serv
ice in the clash with Santa Clara
Saturday. Aside from Bardin, all
the members of the squad seemed
to be in fine fettle.
Selecting a squad of 52 men, the
largest he has ever carried, Coach
Pop Warner last night made his
final cut in the 1930 Stanford foot
ball team. Thirteen ends, eight,
tackles, four centers, five quarter
backs, nine halfbacks, and four full
backs comprise the chosen group.
Warner's list is: left end—Nei 11,
K. Albertson, Colvin, Pike, Craig,
Tyler; left tackle—Bogue, G. Grey,
Burke, Oliver; loft guard—Reiser,
Hand, Hulen, McLeod; center—Tay
lor, M. Albertson, Quirk, Marks;
right guard—Bardin, Dawson, Hunt,
Dohrmann, Kite; right tackle—Cap
tain Tandy, Ehrhorn, Laßorde, N.
Grey; right end—Doub, Bush, Whit
tenau, Walker, Clark, Tampke, Pi
ver.
Quarterback: Hillman, Winnek,
Allen, Baker, Targhetta; left half
back — MofTatt, Rintala, Hardy,
Laird, Campbell; right halfback
Caglieri, Clark, Wilson, Lambert;
fullback—Rothert, Simpkins, Caddel,
and Gilbert.
The '33 freshman team contributed
four men to the squad in the persons
of Ted Kite, guard, Nelson Grey and
Henri Laßorde, takles, and "Red"
Targhetta, quarterback. Last year's
Gray team furnishes four ends, two
tackles, three guards, a center, three
halfbacks, and a fullback. The bal
ance of the squad is composed of
last year's personnel, plus men who
were not out for football a year
ago.
Secret Practice
Last night secret practice was
again in order, and with the smaller
squad divided up into four full
teams Pop put the boys through
pratice without a scrimmage. Run

guards; Captain Ray Tandy and
Dick Bogue, tackles; Joe Bush and
K. Albertson, ends; Hillman at quar
ter; Clark and MofTatt at halves;
and Simpkins at fullback.
Mar Albertson at center worked
with Hand and Kite, guards; George
Grey and "Chuck" Ehrhorn, tackles;
Neill and Doub, ends; Allen, quar
