# THE 						RUSTY STANFORD AXE
## 
### 
Stanford's regained axe is doomed t<> a mouldy and rnstv exis
tence in a hank vault. Action of the University administration in
deciding the weapon should remain under lock and key for the
present means the axe will not tempt the loyal sons of California
to the l\arin with the intention of regaining the trophy they held
for 30 odd years.
To display the axe and to thus invite the Golden Bears to seek
its recovery is dangerous to the athletic program of the I niversitv.
Any attempt of California to recover the axe would necessarily
mean destruction or spoilation of I Diversity property. This might
result in a disruption of athletic relations between Stanford and
California —the gentlemen's agreement agrees to cancellation of
intercollegiate competition if property or lives are menaced.
It is wise to safeguard the axe until provision is made in the
future for the disposal of the famed weapon. It is important, how
ever, that some means he adopted for perpetuating the axe in Stan
ford history instead of keeping it in the musty recesses of a hank
vault.
