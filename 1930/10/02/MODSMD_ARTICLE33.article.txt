# MORALS AND COLLEGE FRESHMEN
## 
### 
In appraising the morality of this generation hoth our critics
and ourselves draw conclusions from observations limited perhaps
to the worst and excluding' the mediocre and the best.
The persons who set our moral standards in the eyes of the
public are not the ones who are most typical of the groups they are
supposed to represent. The great danger in our tendency to accept
the worst as typical of the group is that individuals, especially those
j ust being initiated into the life of the group, may take those gen
eralities as being a suitable and attractive ha*is for conduct and that
bv this means they may ultimately come to represent the real stan
dards of the group.
It behooves the freshman as well ;is his elders to be discriminat
ing in his judgment of what the crowd really thinks and does, for
the pull of the crowd is not easy to resist.â€” The Daily Cardinal
( I'niversity of Wisconsin).
