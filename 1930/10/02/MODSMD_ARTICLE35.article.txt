DOUGH BOYS— At (lie New Stan
ford Theatre.
As a typical Buster Keaton show,
Boys falls short of the
sour-faced comedian's standard, but
it still contains sufficient laughs to
rate on the too of its type.
The picture compares admirably
with the regular war movie situa
tions, but after Keaton takes a few
of his famous slap-stick falls in the
mud, against trees, etc.. you ft el
that this picture is well worth a
laugh. If you are feeling in a sour
mood, it helps; and if you are feel
ing gay, it will leave you in the
a4sles.
Buster takes the part of a 'son
of luxury' who is unwittingly forced
to enlist. There follows a particu
larly funny scene in the training
camp with the eternal sergeant who
makes life what it is for the rook
ies. Next we find Keaton and com
pany in France displaying a num
ber of goodly gags. Cliff Edwards is:
on hand with his ukelele to pull
the picture over some roug! l soots,
which he does with a real touch.
Buster's famous dry humor is a:;
usual the distinctive feature of the
picture.
PARTIES—By Carl Van Vet-Men.
Alfred A. Knopf. New York.
1930.
Liquor glass in hand, David West
lake wanders from speakeasy to
bedroom, from New York to Paris
and back again, always drinking,
always drunk.
With an abundance of delight
fully smart lines and admirable de
scriptions of various bar-rooms,
Van Vechten traces the peregrina
tions of his cocktail-consumer, who
appears in the volume with a hang
over and departs as he is in the
midst of acquiring another one.
Never is the liquor exhausted,
never do all the good drinkers, in
cluding a movie star, a chauffeur,
a bootlegger, a noblewoman, ' a
dancer, sundry girls, and various
visiting Englishmen, lose their de
sire to imbibe it.
Van Vechten gives the impression
of knowing all the right names, and
of using them too frequently.
Everyone sleeps with everyone
else. One little rotter gets killed.
And then everyone has another
drink.
It makes good reading.

SONG O' MY HEART—At the Var
sity Theatre.
The talkies are taking the best
from all fields of entertainment.
Now they have robbed the concert
stage of John McCormack and built
a story around his voice.
Obviously such a story is not

•easily made. The public demands
youth and beauty, and McCormack,
strictly speaking, possesses neither
of these qualities. Still, his voice
should make up for any lack. It is
always that beautiful tenor lhat is
known the world over.
The first part of "Song O' My
Heart" drags slightly. No fast action
can be expected in a small Irish
village. However as soon as Mc-
Cormack starts to sing all is for
given and forgotten.
The plot is simple but not too
obvious and offers many chances
oi hearing McCormack. As an actor
he is utterly at ease and has the
polish of a veteran. His supporting
cast is excellent. Alice Joyce and
Maureen O'Sullivan play the two
feminine leads charmingly, and
Tad, the little boy with an Irish
brogue, is delightful.
LAMENTS FOR THE LIVING. By
Dorothy Parker. Viking Press.
New York. 1930.
Thirteen very short stories which
have appeared separately in such
magazines as "Vanity Fair" and the
"New Yorker" are contained in this
, book. With the sole exception of
"Big Blonde," the stories are char
actor sketches in dialogue instead
of narrative.
"Big Blonde" is a conventional
short story, but conventional only
regarding length and style. It is a
depressing narrative of the trials of
a member of New York's nemi
monde, "a good sport" who always
must keep happy and gay because
"they" like her that way.
The other stories are much short
er. "You Were Perfectly Fine," "The
Sexes,' and "Arrangement in Black
and White" are almost amusing.
"The Mantle of Whistler" gives an
inane conversation between a young
man who has a line and a young
girl who has a line, when they meet
for the first time. But the master
piece of the collection is "The Tele
phone Call." It is a monologue, or
maybe a prayer, of a girl now hope
ful, now despondent, alternately
praying and cursing while waiting
for the lover who is too tired of her
to phone. She bravely resists phon
ing him, although at times she near
ly gives in. The end of the story
leaves one in suspense.
Thtje stories give an admirable
portrayal of one kind of American
civilization. We are thankful that
that is not all there is to America.
One feels as if one knew each of
the characters • and that each was
not making himself or anyone else
happier, that to them life was a
burden. Never have we seen a title
more appropriate to the subject
matter within than "Laments for
the Living." Surely they are more
to be pitied than the dead.

PARTIES—By Carl Van Vet-Men.
Alfred A. Knopf. New York.
1930.
Liquor glass in hand, David West
lake wanders from speakeasy to
bedroom, from New York to Paris
and back again, always drinking,
always drunk.
With an abundance of delight
fully smart lines and admirable de
scriptions of various bar-rooms,
Van Vechten traces the peregrina
tions of his cocktail-consumer, who
appears in the volume with a hang
over and departs as he is in the
midst of acquiring another one.
Never is the liquor exhausted,
never do all the good drinkers, in
cluding a movie star, a chauffeur,
a bootlegger, a noblewoman, ' a
dancer, sundry girls, and various
visiting Englishmen, lose their de
sire to imbibe it.
Van Vechten gives the impression
of knowing all the right names, and
of using them too frequently.
Everyone sleeps with everyone
else. One little rotter gets killed.
And then everyone has another
drink.
It makes good reading.

SONG O' MY HEART—At the Var
sity Theatre.
The talkies are taking the best
from all fields of entertainment.
Now they have robbed the concert
stage of John McCormack and built
a story around his voice.
Obviously such a story is not

•easily made. The public demands
youth and beauty, and McCormack,
strictly speaking, possesses neither
of these qualities. Still, his voice
should make up for any lack. It is
always that beautiful tenor lhat is
known the world over.
The first part of "Song O' My
Heart" drags slightly. No fast action
can be expected in a small Irish
village. However as soon as Mc-
Cormack starts to sing all is for
given and forgotten.
The plot is simple but not too
obvious and offers many chances
oi hearing McCormack. As an actor
he is utterly at ease and has the
polish of a veteran. His supporting
cast is excellent. Alice Joyce and
Maureen O'Sullivan play the two
feminine leads charmingly, and
Tad, the little boy with an Irish
brogue, is delightful.
LAMENTS FOR THE LIVING. By
Dorothy Parker. Viking Press.
New York. 1930.
Thirteen very short stories which
have appeared separately in such
magazines as "Vanity Fair" and the
"New Yorker" are contained in this
, book. With the sole exception of
"Big Blonde," the stories are char
actor sketches in dialogue instead
of narrative.
"Big Blonde" is a conventional
short story, but conventional only
regarding length and style. It is a
depressing narrative of the trials of
a member of New York's nemi
monde, "a good sport" who always
must keep happy and gay because
"they" like her that way.
The other stories are much short
er. "You Were Perfectly Fine," "The
Sexes,' and "Arrangement in Black
and White" are almost amusing.
"The Mantle of Whistler" gives an
inane conversation between a young
man who has a line and a young
girl who has a line, when they meet
for the first time. But the master
piece of the collection is "The Tele
phone Call." It is a monologue, or
maybe a prayer, of a girl now hope
ful, now despondent, alternately
praying and cursing while waiting
for the lover who is too tired of her
to phone. She bravely resists phon
ing him, although at times she near
ly gives in. The end of the story
leaves one in suspense.
Thtje stories give an admirable
portrayal of one kind of American
civilization. We are thankful that
that is not all there is to America.
One feels as if one knew each of
the characters • and that each was
not making himself or anyone else
happier, that to them life was a
burden. Never have we seen a title
more appropriate to the subject
matter within than "Laments for
the Living." Surely they are more
to be pitied than the dead.
DOUGH BOYS— At (lie New Stan
ford Theatre.
As a typical Buster Keaton show,
Boys falls short of the
sour-faced comedian's standard, but
it still contains sufficient laughs to
rate on the too of its type.
The picture compares admirably
with the regular war movie situa
tions, but after Keaton takes a few
of his famous slap-stick falls in the
mud, against trees, etc.. you ft el
that this picture is well worth a
laugh. If you are feeling in a sour
mood, it helps; and if you are feel
ing gay, it will leave you in the
a4sles.
Buster takes the part of a 'son
of luxury' who is unwittingly forced
to enlist. There follows a particu
larly funny scene in the training
camp with the eternal sergeant who
makes life what it is for the rook
ies. Next we find Keaton and com
pany in France displaying a num

SONG O' MY HEART—At the Var
sity Theatre.
The talkies are taking the best
from all fields of entertainment.
Now they have robbed the concert
stage of John McCormack and built
a story around his voice.
Obviously such a story is not

•easily made. The public demands
youth and beauty, and McCormack,
strictly speaking, possesses neither
of these qualities. Still, his voice
should make up for any lack. It is
always that beautiful tenor lhat is
known the world over.
The first part of "Song O' My
Heart" drags slightly. No fast action
can be expected in a small Irish
village. However as soon as Mc-
Cormack starts to sing all is for
given and forgotten.
The plot is simple but not too
obvious and offers many chances
oi hearing McCormack. As an actor
he is utterly at ease and has the
polish of a veteran. His supporting
cast is excellent. Alice Joyce and
Maureen O'Sullivan play the two
feminine leads charmingly, and
Tad, the little boy with an Irish
brogue, is delightful.
LAMENTS FOR THE LIVING. By
Dorothy Parker. Viking Press.
New York. 1930.
Thirteen very short stories which
have appeared separately in such
magazines as "Vanity Fair" and the
"New Yorker" are contained in this
, book. With the sole exception of
"Big Blonde," the stories are char
actor sketches in dialogue instead
of narrative.
"Big Blonde" is a conventional
short story, but conventional only
regarding length and style. It is a
depressing narrative of the trials of
a member of New York's nemi
monde, "a good sport" who always
must keep happy and gay because
"they" like her that way.
The other stories are much short
er. "You Were Perfectly Fine," "The
Sexes,' and "Arrangement in Black
and White" are almost amusing.
"The Mantle of Whistler" gives an
inane conversation between a young
man who has a line and a young
girl who has a line, when they meet
for the first time. But the master
piece of the collection is "The Tele
phone Call." It is a monologue, or
maybe a prayer, of a girl now hope
ful, now despondent, alternately
praying and cursing while waiting
for the lover who is too tired of her
to phone. She bravely resists phon
ing him, although at times she near
ly gives in. The end of the story
leaves one in suspense.
Thtje stories give an admirable
portrayal of one kind of American
civilization. We are thankful that
that is not all there is to America.
One feels as if one knew each of
the characters • and that each was
not making himself or anyone else
happier, that to them life was a
burden. Never have we seen a title
more appropriate to the subject
matter within than "Laments for
the Living." Surely they are more
to be pitied than the dead.
DOUGH BOYS— At (lie New Stan
ford Theatre.
As a typical Buster Keaton show,
Boys falls short of the
sour-faced comedian's standard, but
it still contains sufficient laughs to
rate on the too of its type.
The picture compares admirably
with the regular war movie situa
tions, but after Keaton takes a few
of his famous slap-stick falls in the
mud, against trees, etc.. you ft el
that this picture is well worth a
laugh. If you are feeling in a sour
mood, it helps; and if you are feel
ing gay, it will leave you in the
a4sles.
Buster takes the part of a 'son
of luxury' who is unwittingly forced
to enlist. There follows a particu
larly funny scene in the training
camp with the eternal sergeant who
makes life what it is for the rook
ies. Next we find Keaton and com
pany in France displaying a num
ber of goodly gags. Cliff Edwards is:
on hand with his ukelele to pull
the picture over some roug! l soots,
which he does with a real touch.
Buster's famous dry humor is a:;
usual the distinctive feature of the
picture.
PARTIES—By Carl Van Vet-Men.
Alfred A. Knopf. New York.
1930.
Liquor glass in hand, David West
lake wanders from speakeasy to
bedroom, from New York to Paris
and back again, always drinking,
always drunk.
With an abundance of delight
fully smart lines and admirable de
scriptions of various bar-rooms,
Van Vechten traces the peregrina
tions of his cocktail-consumer, who
appears in the volume with a hang
over and departs as he is in the
midst of acquiring another one.
Never is the liquor exhausted,
never do all the good drinkers, in
cluding a movie star, a chauffeur,
a bootlegger, a noblewoman, ' a
dancer, sundry girls, and various
visiting Englishmen, lose their de
sire to imbibe it.
