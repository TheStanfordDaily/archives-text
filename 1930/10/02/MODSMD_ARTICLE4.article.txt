# DISAPPEARING BAR NO LONGER FOOLS IOWA DRY SQUAD

### 
SIOUX CITY. Ia„ Out. 1 l/l').
—Police were positive there
was a bar at the Idlehour inn.
A sleuth had .seen it, and had
seen men leaning against it
familiarly and drinking liba
tions of undoubted anti-prohi
bition potency.
The police raided the inn.
There was no bar there.
Another sleuth reported see
ing the bar. Again the police
raided. Again they found no
bar. And again. And again.
This might have continued
indefinitely. Police Chief Mor
gan, however, finally found out
about it.
The bar was on a freight
elevator. Every time the place
was raided, the bar and all the
customers were simply hoisted
above or dropped below.
Even the police admitted it
was a pretty slick trick.
