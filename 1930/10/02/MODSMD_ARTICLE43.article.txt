# WIGGINS RETURNS FROM RESEARCH IN LOWER CALIFORNIA
## New Specimens Brought To Add To Collection At Herbarium 
### 
"Commercial exploitation of tim
ber from trees in the mountains of
Lower California s doubtful for
many years," stated Ira Wiggins of
the Dudley Herbarium in an inter
view for the Daily yesterday. Pro
fessor Wiggins returned Tuesday
from a four weeks trip in Lower
California whose object was to col-
I lect material for the Herbarium!
"Our work took us, for the most
part, into the mountains : t an alti
tude of 9600 feet," Professor Wig
gins said. "We paid particular at j
tent ion 10 the trees and timber there
in an endeavor to check up on the
type to be found in the mountains
of California and Lower California.
We traveled in and out most of the
i way on saddle horse: and used pack
animals. We were gratified to find
the vegetation good this year due
to an increase in the rain-fall over
that of last year.
"At the beginning of the trip the
, existence of the quaking aspen, or
I populus tremuloides, in Lower Cali
fornia was doubtful. As a result of
investigation we found it. does grow
in that region. I believe this is the
1 farthest south the tree is to be found.
Those we saw were, however, vari
ants of the species and not quite
typical of the Colorado and Rocky
Mountain type. We also discovered
two new poplars.
"Forests in that region are not as
heavy as those in California. The
same trees are found at a much
higher altitude, but there is less wa
ter. The trees themselves are smaller
and their wood is not as good. Its
grain is crooked instead of straight
and is. therefore, less valuable.
"We consider our trip a very suc
cessful one. Wo brought back 3500
to 4000 shoots of specimens to the
Herbarium. Everywhere we were
met with good will and courtesy by
the Mexican officials ancl citizens.
