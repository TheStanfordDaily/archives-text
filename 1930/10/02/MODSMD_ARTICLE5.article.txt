A wide variety of types are needed
for the play, Helvenston states.
Among the interesting roles to be
filled are a butler, an old maid, two
middle-aged parts, and several
juveniles. The cast totals twelve.
"Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh" by Harry
James Smith was first produced in
1911 with Mrs. Fiske in the title
role. It was scored an immediate
hit and was revised last year with
success.
