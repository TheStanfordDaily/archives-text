# EARTHQUAKES ARE MANUFACTURED FOR SCIENCE VISITORS
## 
### 
American leaders in the scientific
world, who visited the campus Sep
tember 20 as delegates to the annual
meeting of the National Academy of
Science, watched 'home-made"
earthquakes in the vibrations re
search laboratory and were intro
duced to the University's contribu
tion to the advancement of science
in other fields. This was the first
meeting of the Academy west of
the Rocky Mountains.
In the laboratory Professor Lydik
S. Jacobsen "manufactured" earth
quakes and explained peculiarities
in vibration that promise to be use
ful in adding to the safety of build
ings during tremors. Dr. Jacobsen,
who is assistant professor of mech
anical engineering, showed how
small changes in the rates of vibra
tion produce unexpectedly large
changes in action of the earth's sur
face. Four experiments were set up,
showing the action of various ma
terials and structures in response
to an earthquake.
It is hoped from these studies to
make possible the classification of
various soils, showing how they dif
fer in transmitting vibrations, so
that buildings may be planned to
meet local peculiarities.
Visits to the aerodynamics labora
tory, the geology building, and the
Carnegie Institution of plant bio
logy were also made. Guests of the
geology department saw slides made
in Africa by Dr. Bailey Willis and
inspected the Oldroyd collection of
shells.
The Academy met on the Coast,
both at Berkeley and at the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology at
Pasadena, from S: vtember 17 to 23.
