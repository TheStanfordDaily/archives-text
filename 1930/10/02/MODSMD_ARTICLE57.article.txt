ALGIERS (Algeria), Sept. 30 </P). j
! â€”Another Roman city rivaling in
! importance and in beauty Timgad, j
; the African Pompeii discovered in
j 1875, is being uncovered in the de
i partment of Constantino at Lam
| bese, a short distance from Batna.
The ruins cover 133 acres and have j
j a forum which spreads out over
i 21,500 square feet. The Timgad ruins J
cover but ninety-nine acres. The
| Lambese city, founded by veterans
lof Augustus' Third Legion, who
; were stationed in the region, con
| tains two triumphal arches well pre- ,
' served and two large necropolises I
with ornamental monuments for the :
!dead.
j The forum has been completely j
i uncovered. There are but a dozen
! stones missing in the pavement. I
i Numerous Mosaics have been dug
l up, as well as inscriptions with dedi-
I cations to various gods, emperors
; and benefactors of the city.
Lambese was situated in the een- |
j ter of a fertile region when Augus
: tus quartered his soldiers there, but J
j since then the territory became
| marshy and natives avoided it.
