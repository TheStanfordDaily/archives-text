# CHOIR WILL MEET TONIGHT FOR FIRST AUTUMN REHEARSAL
## 
### 
First meeting and rehearsal of
the University choir for the fall
quarter will be held tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Memorial Church.
The Morris Club of Palo Alto, a
chorus of men's voices under the
direction of Warren D. Allen, will
co-operate with the choir for the
music for Matriculation Sunday.
The music sung for the matricu
lation service will be a repetition
of the anthems Lised for the bacca
laureate service last June. Beetho
ven's "Nature's Adoration," and a
new anthem, by Warren D. Allen,
will be sung.
Those interested in applying for
membership in the University choir
should report, if possible, to the
first rehearsal, and see Mr. Allen
in room 84.
