## 
### 
Catherine Snodgrass, a former
Stanford University food research
expert and graduate of Bryn Mawr,
jumped to her death from a window
of a Minneapolis hospital Friday.
No apparent motive could be found
for the tragedy. She had suffered a
breakdown some time ago and was
under observation at the hospital.
She left the food research institute
in San Francisco in June and sailed
for Europe on a Guggenheim schol
arship.
She came to Stanford in 1924.
