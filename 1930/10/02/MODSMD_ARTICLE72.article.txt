Glenn Scobey Warner's elevens
have been famous from Coast to
Coast for their versatile and decep
tive offense, but this year the Old
Fox has turned over a new page
in gridiron history. Adding a new
formation, which for publicity pur
poses has been dubbed "Formation
C," has not been enough for the
Card coach. His backfield men now
change positions with startling ef
fects, and the multiple variations
of plays permissible during past
seasons are as nought compared
with the dazzling array of possibili
ties in store for opposing elevens
this year.
In the past. ''Pop" created a
furor when he produced two
fullbacks in one backfield, and
now this innovation has become
part and parcel of the Warner
system.
This year, Formation C includes
;i balanced line with ends playing
wide and a backfield arranged as
was the backfield of Formation B;
I hat is, two wing halfbacks, a quar
terback three yards and a fullback
six yards behind the line of scrim
mage. Both "A" and "C" formations
are used indiscriminately by the
varsity.
Hi't the new arrangement of
men in formation is luii one of
fiie aces Warner holds. Specta
tors at the Stanford-Army game
were forced to rub their eyes
when the white-shirted lads
trotted out of the huddle into
Formation C with none other
than Rudy Rintala at fullback
and Harlow Rothert at half, the
reverse of the positions they had
been filling before.
And not only did Rambling Rudy
run plays from the fullback post,
but the Warnermen added to the
confusion of the Winged Washer
defenders by running a pass play,
Rothert to Rintala, and turning
around four plays later to have
Rintala pass to Rothert.
According to the demon statisti
cians, the new model of Warner's
varsity possesses over two hundred
plays or their variation, and with
Ihe ground-gaining propensities of
all backs further enhanced by their
varying positions, the problems of
opposing elevens to solve Stan
ford's offensive system have been
complicated beyond measure.
Since the halfback moved to
the fullback position has been
given an opportunity to hit the
line (and imagine the possibili
ties this opens for 205-pound
(<uido Caglieri!), it will not be
surprising to see the fullback
moved to the halfback's post
taking the ball off tackle on a
reverse.
Not only does this shift of back
field men permit fhe Cards to util
ize the passing and kicking abilities
of all backs, it also eliminates the
necessity for a punt formation such
as Warner was forced to extem
porize last year when injuries
played havoc with the Stanford
backfield machinery.
Before long it will not be sur
prising to see little Harry Hillman
capering around end, and Bill Clark
crashing the line when a couple of
yards are needed for first down. And
why not? It would be the last thing
I lie opposition would be expecting.

;i balanced line with ends playing
wide and a backfield arranged as
was the backfield of Formation B;
I hat is, two wing halfbacks, a quar
terback three yards and a fullback
six yards behind the line of scrim
mage. Both "A" and "C" formations
are used indiscriminately by the
varsity.
Hi't the new arrangement of
men in formation is luii one of
fiie aces Warner holds. Specta
tors at the Stanford-Army game
were forced to rub their eyes
when the white-shirted lads
trotted out of the huddle into
Formation C with none other
than Rudy Rintala at fullback
and Harlow Rothert at half, the
reverse of the positions they had
been filling before.
And not only did Rambling Rudy
run plays from the fullback post,
but the Warnermen added to the
confusion of the Winged Washer
defenders by running a pass play,
Rothert to Rintala, and turning
around four plays later to have
Rintala pass to Rothert.
According to the demon statisti
cians, the new model of Warner's
varsity possesses over two hundred
plays or their variation, and with
Ihe ground-gaining propensities of
all backs further enhanced by their
varying positions, the problems of
opposing elevens to solve Stan
ford's offensive system have been
complicated beyond measure.
Since the halfback moved to
the fullback position has been
given an opportunity to hit the
line (and imagine the possibili
ties this opens for 205-pound
(<uido Caglieri!), it will not be
surprising to see the fullback
moved to the halfback's post
taking the ball off tackle on a
reverse.
Not only does this shift of back
field men permit fhe Cards to util
ize the passing and kicking abilities
of all backs, it also eliminates the
necessity for a punt formation such
as Warner was forced to extem
porize last year when injuries
played havoc with the Stanford
backfield machinery.
Before long it will not be sur
prising to see little Harry Hillman
capering around end, and Bill Clark
crashing the line when a couple of
yards are needed for first down. And
why not? It would be the last thing
I lie opposition would be expecting.

Glenn Scobey Warner's elevens

tive offense, but this year the Old
Fox has turned over a new page
in gridiron history. Adding a new
formation, which for publicity pur
poses has been dubbed "Formation
C," has not been enough for the

of plays permissible during past
seasons are as nought compared
with the dazzling array of possibili

this year.
