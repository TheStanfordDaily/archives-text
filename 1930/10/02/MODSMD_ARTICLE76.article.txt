# Ellington Declares Card Track Prospects Bright
## WEEKLY TRACK MEETS LISTED; MANY PRACTICE Many Veterans Returning; 150 Men Expected For Workout 
### 
With the first of the weekly track
and field meets scheduled to be held
next Friday afternoon, October 9,
fall track practice will get under
way this afternoon at the practice
oval at 4 o'clock.
While a number of track men are
out for football, about 150 are ex
pected to report for the initial work
out, including freshman and varsity
prospects.
Glancing over the registrations al
ready made, Assistant Coach El
lington yesterday afternoon declared
prospects for the spring sport as
bright as ever.
Many veterans are returning, a
number of good prospects from last
year's frosh will be on deck to bat
tle for varsity posts, and several
transfer students are expected to
add strength to the squad.
Heading the list of returning vet
erans is "Hec" Dyer, conqueror of
Frankie Wyckoff, who will again
tread the cinder paths for Stanford.
With the Southern California star
expected to suffer no permanent ill
effects from his broken ankle, the
Dyer-Wyckoff duel will be resumed
this spring where 'it left off last
season, and should furnish one of
the principal thrills of Pacific Coast
track.
J.C. Material
Two junior college transfers loom
as varsity material. Paul Zachcs,
who hails from San Benito J.C. at
Hollister, has attained 6 feet 1 inch
in the high jump and has leaped 24
feet in the broad jump. At present
Zaches is out for football. Deacon,
of Menlo J.C., pole-vaults 12 feet,
broad-jumps around 23 feet, and is
good for better than 6 feet in the
high jump.
Storm, winner of the half-mile
and mile events in the interclass
meet last year, will be eligible for
varsity competition this season. He
reeled off the four-lap event in 4:30
in the interclass, later coming back
to cop the shorter run in 1:58.
A number of last year's yearlings
will be back to bid for varsity posi
tions, including Laborde and Gray,
weight men; Eastman, sensational
quarter-miier; Williard and Black
man, broad-jumpers; Naylon and
Mires, half-milers; Foldt, hurdler,
and Hunter, miler.
Frosh Register
Seventeen frosh of high-school
reputation registered with Ellington
yesterday. While it is too early to
state definitely, Ellington believes
another strong yearling squad is in
prospect.
Among the babes are Van Dellan,
Salinas pole-vaulter; Wilson, who
set marks of 8:9 and 21.2 in the
century and furlong in the C.I.F.
meet of two years ago; Lyman of
Santa Monica, C.I.F. shot put rec
ord-holder; King, San Francisco i
broad-jumper; and Borton, Bakers
field weight man.
Ellington also reported a number
of frosh prospects for the hurdles,
but slated that time alone will re
veal if the quality is as good as the
quantity.
