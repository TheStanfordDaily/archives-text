# A 						SHORT HISTORY OF FOOTBALL
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
At Rugby, England, stands a
| granite slab on which is inscribed
i the words "This stone commemo
rates the exploit of William Webb
' Ellis, who, with a fine disregard for
i the Rules of Football as played in
| his time, first took the ball in his
arms and ran with it, thus originat
i ing the distinctive feature of the
I Rugby Game, A.D. 1823."
Just 106 years later, another
young man named Ellis picked a
i Dartmouth forward pass out of the
I air and raced 95 yards to score
Yale's winning touchdown before
I 80,000 people. It's a far cry from

Biil Ellis of Rugby to Hoot Ellis
| of Yale, yet not as far as from the
Ellises of Greek and Roman times
to these modern football heroes, and
the Greeks and Romans did play
football! In fact, the game was so
"over-emphasized" in ancient times
that one Aristonico Caristo, the Al
bie Booth of his day, was exempted
from military service, crowned with
laurel, and given the daughter of
i an Athenian nobleman to marry; all
| because he was the greatest "Phen-
I inda" player of his time! "Phenin
-1 da" was just the Greek name for
1 Football. The Romans called it

I "Harpastum," and opened each con
test with a forward pass.
As I brought out last summer in
a cartoon on the History of Golf,
an edict of the Scottish Parliament
in 1457 ordered that "fute-ball and
golf and ilk unprofitable sports be
utterly creyit doune and nocht
usit.' The idea was that football and
golf were cutting into time that
should have been devoted to arch
ery.
In Merrie Olde England entire
villages turned out to play football
against each other, a game some
j times lasting an entire month. In

I this respect the sport may be com
> pared to lacrosse as played by the
' American Indians.
Who is there among us that can
| surely say that our earliest ances
! tors did not play football back in
; the Stone Age, using a petrified
Dinosaur's egg in lieu of a pigskin?
And I can imagine King Tut watch
| ing a contest in the shadow of one
of the Pyramids. "The game ain't
what it used to be," he is saying to
I his favorite wife. "Why, you should
have seen Willi-bel-Heston, the
Battering Rameses of twenty years
I ago!"
