# STIFF WORKOUT FOR CAL FROSH FOLLOWS SATURDAY DOWNING
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. I.â€”Upon the
heads of the California freshman
football squad fell the wrath of Jupe
Pluvius, Coach Roy Riegels and his
aides. Fat Latham and Hal Brecken
ridge, this afternoon because of their
feeble showing against the gridders
from San Mateo Junior College last
Saturday.
Sweat mingled with the rain as
the penalty for "fatheadedness" of
the Babes. With little regard for the
finer points of the game, the coaches
gave the yearlings a stiff workout
on the tackling dummy, clipping
practice, the shift and running
through plays.
Even after old Sol dipped behind
the clouds that were drifting in from
the golden west, the coaches kept
their charges at work. The back
fields were segregated from their
forward wall and were given an
other chance !> run through signals
the way they should have last Sat
urday.
The first team for the afternoon
consisted of Hackley and Sublett,
ends; Ransome and Pillar, tackles;
Carlson and Dolling, guards; Tucker,
center; Friedman an d Adams,
halved: Tofanclli, fullback, and
Stewart, quarter.
