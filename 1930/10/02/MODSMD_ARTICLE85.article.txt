I 1. (/P)--Setting a World's Series rec
( ord, the world's champion Athletics
combed Burleigh Grimes for five
hits, all for extra bases, and con
j verted them all into runs to beat
the St. Louis Cardinals 5 to 2 in
| the opening game of Die champion-
J ship battle today, before a crowd of
j 32,295 fans, including President
j Hoover.
Although the National Leaguers
i slammed Robert Moses Grove,
j southpaw ace of the A's for a total
| of nine safe hits, they were able
I to score in only one inning while
| the world's champions made every
i hit oft' Grimes count. Home runs by
I A 1 Simmons and Mickey Cochrane,
i triples by George Haas and Jimmy
; Foxx, plus a rousing double by
1 Jimmy Dykes, combined to start
! Ihe Athletics off triumphantly in
| their light to retain the world's
j baseball championship.
Simmons' home run over the right
1 field wall in the fourth inning and
| a two-base drive against the cen
ter field stands in the sixth by
Jimmy Dykes, scoring Max Bishop,
enabled the American Leaguers to
overhaul their rivals in the pitch
ing duel between Bob Grove, south
paw ace of the A's, and the veteran
Burleigh Grimes, spitball artist.
They added another in the seventh
on Haas's triple and Bolcy's sacri
fice bunt.
These spurts overcame the ad
vantage registered by the Cardinals
when they rapped Grove in the
third for four hits and a pair of
, runs.
The A's southpaw fanned only
five Vardinals, three of them in the
first two innings, while Grimes
struck out six.
The crowd was the biggest that
ever saw a World's Scries game in
Philadelphia, the total of 32,295 cus
tomers contributing to a "gate" of
$152,735.
