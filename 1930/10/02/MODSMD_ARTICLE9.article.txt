SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. I—P.I.P.
—Men are not only created unequal,
their training makes them even less
nearly equal.
So declares Dr. R. C. Tryon, lec
turer with the University of Cali
fornia Extension Division, who will
give lectures on General Psychology
and the Psychology of Individual
Differences this fall, at 540 Powell
street, in the Extension building.
"It is the measurement of individ
ual differences in mental ability
among men and the discovery of
the causcs of these differences which
is the object of innumerable experi
ments being now conducted by psy
chologists," he states. "In the pro
gressive schools, children are given
psychological examinations and put
into classes where the instruction is
'fitted' to their abilities.
"In the field of law enforcement,
the legal profession is beginning to
accept the psychiatric position that
the habitual criminal is a 'mentally
sick person, and should not be pun
ished, but treated. In business the
personnel or vocational director now
must lean heavily upon the finding
of scientific psychology of individ
ual differences if he is to be of
value."
Tiie psychologist is beginning to
discover some of the laws which
cause individuals to diffef in learn
ing, although there is a vast amount
of work to be accomplished in this
field, he states.
