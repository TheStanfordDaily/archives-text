# SHARE PRICES RALLY WITH BOND MARKET SENTIMENT IMPROVED
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 1 (/P).â€”The im
proved sentiment in financial circles,
reflected in the rally of share prices,
influenced a better general tone in
the bond market today.
The liquidation among foreign
loans and speculative industrials
subsided and some buying appeared
to force an irregular upturn. For the
first time this week the averages for
:J0 bonds showed an advance.
Considerable interest was mani
fested in bond circles in the reduc
tion of interest rates by man/ New
York savings banks to 4 per cent.
One of the principal factors influ
encing the reduction was the rise
in prices of legal bonds causing
shrinkage in the yields, and made
it difficult for savings banks to
make profitable investments with
money on which they were paying
4':: per cent. It is presumed that
the bond marke! will be one of the
principal beneficiaries from any di
version of savings banks deposits.
