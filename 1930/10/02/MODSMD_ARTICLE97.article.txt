ROME, Oct. 1. (Associated Press)
â€”Premier Mussolini today advo
cated the death penalty for specu
lators who bring on financial crises.
The Premier, speaking at the first
sitting of the National Council of
Corporations, which links all forms
of Italian capital and labor, said he
already had made examples of
speculators in the Aosta and Cam
pobasso districts and would deal
more strictly with the type in the
future.
"They will now be made to feel
more acutely that they cannot fool
the public with impunity," he con
tinued. "Because of the infinite evil
they express as sowers of ruin and
misery, they merit the penalty of
death." ,
