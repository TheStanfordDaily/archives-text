If you're hard on your shoes... if you want a rugged,
wear-resisting, heavy weather oxford, with the thickest
sole (double) you've ever seen, get a load of these
"Gunboats"! You've heard of the wonderful Scotch
Grain leather from Martin of Glasgow . . . that's the
leather used in these shoes, only it's oil treated and
colored a deep reddish brown known as "ZUG or
block if you prefer . , . ond they're lined thruout with
leather. The best bargain you've ever struck at $6.50.
