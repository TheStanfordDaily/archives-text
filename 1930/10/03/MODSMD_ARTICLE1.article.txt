# HOOVER TELLS BANKERS THAT U.S. MUST LEAD
## America Must Pull Out of World-Wide Depression Independently OTHER NATIONS SUFFER 
### 
PUBLIC AUDITORIUM,' Cleve
land, 0., Oct. 2 (Associated Press). —
President Hoover tonight told the
American Bankers' Association that
although Ihe current business de
pression is world wide, America
must go forward independently to
recovery and maintain its standard
of living.
At the same time, the chief execu
tive replied directly to political op
ponents "who resent the notion that
things will never get better and who
wish to enjoy our temporary mis
ery."
"To recount to these persons," he
said, "the progress of cooperation
between the people and the govern
ment in amelioration of this situa
tion, or to mention are suf
fering less than other countries, or
that savings are piling up in the
banks, or that our people are pay
ing off installment purchases, that
abundant capital is now pressing for
new ventures and employment, only
inspires the unkind retort that we
should fix our gaze upon the un
happy features of the decline."
DECRIES "HOWLERS"
The President, making his only
major address or recent months just
a few weeks before the fall elec
tions, spoke in the large auditorium
in which in 1924 Calvin Coolidgc
was nominated for the presidency
by the Republican national conven
tion.
His audience was composed
largely of bankers and their wives
drawn from all parts of the nation
for the s(>tb annual convention of
the association who had been given
preference in the admission tickets
to the auditorium seating more than
10,000 persons. Amplifiers, however,
carried the address to a supplemen
tary auditorium behind the stage,
where a second gathering heard the
address, in addition to those who
listened in on the National radio
hookups.
Retorting in the course of his ad
dress to a suggestion in bankers'
discussion that American standards
of living be lowered, Mr. Hoover
said, "to that I emphatically dis
agree."
"I do not believe it represents the
views of this association," he added,
"not only do I not accept such a
theory, but on the contrary, the
whole purpose and ideal of this sys
tem which is distinctive of our whole
country, is to increase the standard
of living by the adoption and the
conveniently widening diffusion of
•invention and discovery amongst
the whole of our people.
