BERKELEY, Oct. 2 (P.1.P.).â€”
Speech differences, so prevalent in
the language of the American peo
ple, will largely be lost within the
next century.
That is the belief of Miss Jean
Campbell Macmillan, lecturer on
speech making and dramatics with
the University of California Exten-
The lecturer believes that the
sion Division,
spread of rapid communications will
be responsiole for the future simi
larity in speech. She says,"The
radio, the talking picture and trans
portation facilities, which enable a
person to go to any part of the coun
try with easy facility, arc ironing out
the differences in regional speech.
The average American, also, is be
ginning to realize for the first time
just how important the voice is, and
that it is the main currency of mak
ing contact with the rest of the
world."
