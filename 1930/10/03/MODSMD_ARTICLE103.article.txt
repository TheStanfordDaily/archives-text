### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 2. (P.1.P.) â€”
Members and guests of the National
Academy of Sciences which is now
holding its first western meeting in
the 67 years of its existence, were
informed of the work that the Uni
versity of California and Stanford
arc doing to add to the world's un
derstanding of earthquakes, to make
use of them for scientific study of
the interior of the earth, and to
minimize their damage.
Lydik Jacobsen of Stanford Uni
versity explained that scientists at
that institution have constructed an
apparatus which reproduces the ma
jor movements of the earth's crust
during an earthquake, and on which
they are planning to build model
engineering structures as a means
of testing the stability of various
construction designs. The apparatus
consists of a large structural steel
platform, nine by twelve feet,
mounted on street car wheels, which
is capable of executing, either
simultoneously or independently,
two types of vibration in one direc
tion.
