# EMBLEMS TORN OFF GARIBALDI'S STATUE
## 
### 
liOME, Oct. 2 I/Pi. â€”Romans liv
ing on Janiculum Hill awake today
to find the Equestrian monument
of Garibaldi, Italian liberator, strip
ped of iis Masonic emblems, and
wearing brand new Fascist ones.
During the night workmen chipped
off the former and carved on the
latter.
The monument already had been
the subject of considerable contro
versy since atop it the bronze statue
of Garibaldi, who was instrumental
in taking away the power of the
Popes, frowns down upon the Vati
can.
