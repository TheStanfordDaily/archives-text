## Separate Signout Book for 2:30 Leaves Discussed; New Regulations in Hand-Book Include Hours Changed for Locking Houses 
### 
lockout regulations for women will go into effect Thursday. Such
was the decision of Conference last night. It was thought necessary to
present the rules before the living group:; at Monday night's house meeting
and to everyone at a women's assembly Wednesday night, before putting
them in use.
Although the women's assembly on Wednesday night postpones the
Conference party scheduled then, the executive group decided that since
the new women have already been told to go by the old rules until
Thursday. It was also pointed out that since the year was a trial year

• only, it would be best to have
| everything fully explained, for mis
' takes might resuit in serious future
| changes and house presidents were
! warned that a 2:30 lockout would
j be considered a serious offense by
j the Administration.
Check on 2:30 Leaves
A separate sign-out book for the
I 2:30 o'clock leaves is to be used in
every living group. The name must
I be signed out to leave, and on re
| turning it will be necessary to sign
the destination of the evening and
j the time of return. A separate paper
! with name, destination, and time of
return must be also filled out. These
i slips are to go to the Council for
I check and will be used to deter
| mine how much and how often the
! 2:30 leave is used. This extra check,
and the new regulation requiring
j the person to sign time of return
is an agreement made with the Ad
; ministration in regard to keeping
j statistics of the trial year.
It will also be necessary for row
j women to obtain a key from the
1 housemother if they are out later
| than the closing hour. If the des-
I tination is indefinite, it will be pos-i
' sible to sign out for a 2:30 o'clock
leave, although the place attended
| be nearer than an hour's drive, Con
ference decided. The double 2:30
I sign-up will check this.

New Rules Explained
The new regulations which are
I published in the handbook were
gone over and changes and addi
j tions were discussed. The rule that
houses are to be locked at 10:30
o'clock week nights and 12 o'clock
I week-ends, which was passed last

Also that a woman may sign out to
1 le ave the living group for late leave
1 until 11:30 o'clock on week nights
I and 12 o clock on week-ends.

I group, another Conference meeting
has been called for Monday after
| noon at 1 o'clock to clarify the ac
tion taken tonight and to discuss the
rules to be brought up in house
■ meeting that night.
lockout regulations for women will go into effect Thursday. Such
was the decision of Conference last night. It was thought necessary to
present the rules before the living group:; at Monday night's house meeting
and to everyone at a women's assembly Wednesday night, before putting
them in use.

Conference party scheduled then, the executive group decided that since
the new women have already been told to go by the old rules until
Thursday. It was also pointed out that since the year was a trial year

• only, it would be best to have

the destination of the evening and
j the time of return. A separate paper
! with name, destination, and time of
return must be also filled out. These
i slips are to go to the Council for
I check and will be used to deter
| mine how much and how often the
! 2:30 leave is used. This extra check,
and the new regulation requiring
j the person to sign time of return
is an agreement made with the Ad
; ministration in regard to keeping
j statistics of the trial year.
It will also be necessary for row
j women to obtain a key from the
1 housemother if they are out later

I tination is indefinite, it will be pos-i
' sible to sign out for a 2:30 o'clock
leave, although the place attended

ference decided. The double 2:30
