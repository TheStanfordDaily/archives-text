line with the many physiological
similarities between man and mon
key, the University of California de
partment of zoology has just demon
strated that monkeys of the Macacus
rhesus and cynomolgus types from
Java, India and China are afTicted
with a microscopic amoeba of the
mouth identical with that known as
Endamoeba gingivalis in man.
in monkeys, as in the case of man,
also, these microscopic organisms
are found in conjunction with a di- ,
eased condition of the mouth com
monly known as pyorrhea. Amoeba
of the mouth are found in few ani
mals. Outside of the simian family,
the dog and the horse are the only
ones known to be so afflicted.
