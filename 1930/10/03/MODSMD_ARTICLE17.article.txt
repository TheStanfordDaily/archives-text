# IMPRACTICAL JOKER CAUSES OWN DEATH
## 
### 
MANDAN, N.D., Oct. 2. (/Pi—Ed
ward Loran was a practical joker.
He often had told his brother, Ted,
that he planned to play a good one
on his wife—make her believe he
had hanged himself.
Today funeral arrangements were
being made for Edward after his
body had been found suspended
from a noose in his basement. Ted
Loran said his brother's body was
about one-fourth of an inch of! the
floor. He thought Edward had mis
judged the length of the rope.
