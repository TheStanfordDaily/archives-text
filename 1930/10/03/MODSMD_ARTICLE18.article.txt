# INDUSTRIAL POISONING NEARING ELIMINATION---SAFETY CONGRESS
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Oct. 2. (TP)—ln
dustrial poisoning due to the use of
chemicals in industry is nearing
elimination through the increasing
use of machinery, the National
Safety Congress was told today by
speakers who have studied condi
tions in factories using poisonous
chemicals.
P. W. Gumaer, of the chemical
division of the Barrett Company,
New York, said the danger of poison
gases had decreased with the advent
of scientific ventilation. Increased
safety also was attributed to the use
of pipe lines in mixing chemicals in
modern plants as compared to the
older method of laborers pouring
solutions.
Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd
described the safety precautious

taken in his exploration trips to the
Congress last night. He used motion
pictures of the building of his base
in Little America as an example
and received special commendation
on his precautions taken against
fire and the danger of losing men
in blizzards. Admiral Byrd said he
placed each building a specified dis
tance from any other structure to
prevent a fire destroying all, and
connected them with snow tunnels
that the men might not be lost in
the severe storms while going from
one structure to another.
Charles Berquist, Western Elec
tric Company, Chicago, was elected
president of the National Safety
Council at a dinner preceding the
Byrd address. He succeeds C. E.
Pettibone, Boston.
