# TOADS DISCOVERED IN OKLAHOMA BREAK FAST OF 300 YEARS
## 
### 
(•rP).—Three small toads apparently
suffered no pangs of indigestion to
day after partaking of what archae
ologists believed was their first meal
in more than 300 years.
The toads, found near Gate, Okla.,
by J. B. Thoburn, State Historical
Society curator, while excavating in
an Indian mound, were fed flies,
yesterday. They were not eager for
food, apparently, after their fast of
undetermined length, but ate when
food was placed in their mouths.
Dr. Frank Brooks, biologist at
Oklahoma City University, classified
the toads as belonging to the Peloba
tidae family and to the Genus Sca
phiopus.
As the three toads do not conform
in description to the one species
listed in scientific catalogues or
books said it was barely possible
they belong to a hitherto unknown
branch.
No opinion was expressed by Dr.
Brooks as to how long the toads
had been buried or as to whether
they could live if buried 300 years.
Thoburn, however, was vigorous in
defense of his estimate.
