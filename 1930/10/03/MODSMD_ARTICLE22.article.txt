### 
PARIS, Oct. 2 (/P).â€”Swift, silent
cars for the rich and smaller, more
economical ones for the thrifty are
the two talking points of the
Auto Salon which opened today in
the big glass roofed Grand Palais.
In several ways American influ
ence is stronger than ever. The
French haven't abandoned their
claim to being chief among the orig
inators of car ideas but they arc
following the trend of the United
States.
