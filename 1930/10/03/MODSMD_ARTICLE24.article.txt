# RUSHING OF NEW MEN IS DEFERRED UNTIL OCTOBER 6
## 
### 
Until the list of new men
with ninety units or more is
published on Monday all rush
ing is to be suspended, accord
ing to "Bingo ' Grant, president
of the Intcrfraternity Council.
Through an unavoidable delay
the list, although it has al
ready been made out and is on
file in the office of Dean Cul
ver, could not be published
this week. Anyone interested
may refer to the list at any
time.
In order to better systema
tize the fall quarter rushing,
it will be illegal to rush stu
dents who have attended the
University for three previous
quarters until the list is for
mally out. Students who have
attended the University part of
the school year, not including
summer quarter, will also be
eligible after Monday.
