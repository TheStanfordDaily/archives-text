# CARDS OUT FOR VENGEANCE ON BRONCO ELEVEN
## Santa Clarans Have Upset Redshirts Twice In Three Years WARNER NAMES LINEUP 
### Bv Len Kullmami 
Hoping to bring their record of
victories over Santa Clara for a
four-year period to a .500 average,
Stanford's varsity football squad de
voted last night's practice to polish
ing off some of the rough spots in
their offense. No scrimmage was
held last night, but the squad ran
through plays to perfect their exe
cution.
According to the list announced
by Pop Warner, the team which
takes the lield tomorrow at 2:30
against the Broncos will be com
posed of Colvin and Doub, ends;
Burke and Captain Ray Tandy,
tackles; Hand and Dawson, guards;
Taylor, center; Hillman, quarter
back: Moffatt and Clark, halves; and
Simkins, fullback.
In starting Colvin and Burke, Pop
is evidently endeavoring to season
two needed replacements while he
can. Colvin, whose work in the first
two games of the season has stamped
him as a comer, will be greatly
benefited by the opportunity to
work against a team of the calibre
of the Broncos. Burke, substitute
tackle, will also be given an oppor
tunity to prove himself under fire,
and his play in tomorrow's tilt will
indicate what may be expected of
him in the future.
All in Shape
The whole squad, with the excep
tion of Bardin, appears to be in fine
shape for the clash. Caglieri, al
though favoring his injured arm to
some extent, appears to be fit, and
Dick Bogue, who was slightly under
the weather Wednesday night, has
completely recovered. Bardin, al
though out in football togs, did not
practice with the team but instead
devoted himself to giving Wallacc
Denny a workout chasing drop
kicks.
â€¢Hardened by their experience with
the California Bears a week ago in
the Memorial Stadium, the green
clad warriors will be no set-up for
the Cardinals. Blame the shift, or
over-confidence, or what have you,
the fact remains that Santa Clara
lias been more than moderately suc
cessful in checking the Warnermen
in the past, and a victory over the
Broncos means revenge for past in
juries at their hands.
Bears Won
Since Nibs Price's men have al
ready taken Santa Clara into camp
to the tune of 19 to 7, the Stanford
varsity will not only be seeking re
venge but endeavoring to stop Cali
fornia's margin of victory as well.
Reverses, laterals, passes, and bucks
will be thrown at the shifting sys
tem of Smith, and fans will see
much that is new and different in
the Warner plays tomorrow.
Should the Stanford system click
perfectly, Santa Clara's defense will
be split apart and the Card backs
will stage a parade down the field.
However, perfection cannot be ex
pected in the third game of the sea
son, and the final score may be fair
ly close. Stanford should win by
two touchdowns.
