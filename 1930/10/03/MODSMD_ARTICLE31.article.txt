# THOSE FIGHTING GREYS

### 
"Many arc* called. hut few are chosen."
And so it is with "l'o]i" Warner's lootball team, bitty-two men
have heen chosen â€”to make up the varsity s<|ua<l. l ilty-two men
will he issued bright new uniforms. Fifty-two men will trot into
the stadium each Saturday to receive the cheers ot thousands of
spectators. Fifty-two men will he the center of Stanford adulation
for the next two months.
And the other 40' men who were striving for the coveted var
sity positions will he relegated to the "(loots." I'hese men will
sweat and strain just as hard as the lucky fifty-two. The mere
fact that they stick, ably demonstrates their loyalty to Stanford and
their love of the game.
That name "(ioofs" is an ugly word. Mere's a Stanford tradi
tion that may well he junked. "Stanford 11 revs" is a much more
fitting title for these stalwarts! .Many of the "(Ireys" would he
plaving in the first-string lineup at a smaller school. The men play
a line, intelligent brand ot football. Watch them practice some
afternoon on the field behind the military yard. See them plav
on Saturdav. (loots? Not much!
