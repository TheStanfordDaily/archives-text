# BOOM DAYS AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Stanford's registration for autumn quarter is a marked increase
of students over the same period a year ago. The figures show a
total of 3.524 students registered as compared to 3.4SCi last year.
A year ago this time many of the country's inhabitants were
dreaming of gilded money bags in proverbial bank vaults as the
result of unprecedented high quotations in the stock market. Fv
erybodv was enjoying life.
Todav. the pessimists are enjoying the gloomy days of deprcs
sion. The optimists are seeing a ray of light in the financial dol
drums that struck the country with the collapse of Wall Street
securities last November.
If the increase in registration over that of last year is anv indi
cation then the days of the depression must he at an end. Then too,
Stanford might have robbed the remainder of the coast colleges and
universities of students—for most oi them reported decreases in
attendance. However, it is hoped that business conditions have
improved so as not to endanger education of the nation's future
fenerations.
