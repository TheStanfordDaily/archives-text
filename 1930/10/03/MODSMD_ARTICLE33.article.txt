# WHY NOT HELLO?
## 
### 
"Ilcllo." "Ilelln." Such was tlie cheery greetin;.; oi Stanford
.-tinlents in recent years.
"Hello," from a freshman and no response, or a grudging one,
from an upperclassman i> the usual greeting of Stanford students
today.
Kverv year the incoming freshmen are told ahout the "hello
and they are generally impressed. They are glad to learu
of Stanford's democracy and good fellowship; they are happy to
he able to share in them. Accordingly, the freshmen hello ener
getically for several days sometimes weeks, â€”greeting old students
or new students alike whom they may chance to meet on the cam
pus, greeting them until the unresponsiveness ol the upperclassincu
causes the first year men to lapse into similar silence.
It isn't a large task to say hello. Stanford isn't yet so mature
that a cheerful greeting betokens a lack of dignity. The I niversity
undoubtedly is passing out of the period ol its youth, but it will
never be too old for the best of its campus institutions, friendliness
as represented by the "hello" system.
And while the men are helloing, why not have the women do
likewise
