MAKGAKET YOKKE .By Kathleen
Norris. Doubleday Doran.
Kathleen Norris has a machine,
evidently similar to those owned by
Zane Grey, Edgar Wallace, into
which one pours characters, ' plots,"
and descriptions, and from which a
neatly bound, printed book emerues.
Mrs. Norris' has an extra gadget,
which interweaves a moral, but
which takes pains not to weave it in
too subtly.
This latest, entitled "Marjaret
Yorke' (unless one appealed since
3:35 yesterday, when this wa.. writ
ten) is an excellent example of the
products of this machine. Paradoxi
cally, the machine bears a resem
blance to a fine etching, from which,
only so many impressions can be
printed, before the: lines lose their
lustre. Ibis etching wasn't good even
when completed, it's very bad now
that it has been overly used.
This book is, I am told, "a story
of the conflict of wills and ideals of
two women, one thoroughly fine,
the other superficial and wordly
minded, in which all the honors go
to the first." That's what I'm told
it is, here's what it is: inane mawk
ish sentimentality set to a pattern
that lacks any semblance of life.
It's the sort of thing whose Cin
derella flavor will just appeal to the
American shop-girl, to whose in
telligence Mrs. Norris stoops in
writing such work. You know the
ending before you've begun, and
you forget the beginning before you
end it. It extends to 25 chapters,
which bear a singular resemblance
to one another, with their lovely
moral lessons, descriptions of na
ture, and pathetic introspection. In
trospection of the nature in which
Dorothy Dix indulges when she
"looks into a woman's heart."

MAKGAKET YOKKE .By Kathleen
Norris. Doubleday Doran.
Kathleen Norris has a machine,
evidently similar to those owned by
Zane Grey, Edgar Wallace, into
which one pours characters, ' plots,"
and descriptions, and from which a
neatly bound, printed book emerues.
Mrs. Norris' has an extra gadget,
which interweaves a moral, but
which takes pains not to weave it in
too subtly.
This latest, entitled "Marjaret
Yorke' (unless one appealed since
3:35 yesterday, when this wa.. writ
ten) is an excellent example of the
products of this machine. Paradoxi
cally, the machine bears a resem
blance to a fine etching, from which,
only so many impressions can be
printed, before the: lines lose their
lustre. Ibis etching wasn't good even
when completed, it's very bad now
that it has been overly used.
This book is, I am told, "a story
of the conflict of wills and ideals of
two women, one thoroughly fine,
the other superficial and wordly
minded, in which all the honors go
to the first." That's what I'm told
it is, here's what it is: inane mawk
ish sentimentality set to a pattern
that lacks any semblance of life.
It's the sort of thing whose Cin
derella flavor will just appeal to the
American shop-girl, to whose in
telligence Mrs. Norris stoops in
writing such work. You know the
ending before you've begun, and
you forget the beginning before you
end it. It extends to 25 chapters,
which bear a singular resemblance
to one another, with their lovely
moral lessons, descriptions of na
ture, and pathetic introspection. In
trospection of the nature in which
Dorothy Dix indulges when she
"looks into a woman's heart."
