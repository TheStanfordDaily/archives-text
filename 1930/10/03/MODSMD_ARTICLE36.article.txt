MAKGAKET YOKKE .By Kathleen
Norris. Doubleday Doran.
Kathleen Norris has a machine,
evidently similar to those owned by
Zane Grey, Edgar Wallace, into
which one pours characters, ' plots,"
and descriptions, and from which a
neatly bound, printed book emerues.
Mrs. Norris' has an extra gadget,
which interweaves a moral, but
which takes pains not to weave it in
too subtly.
This latest, entitled "Marjaret
Yorke' (unless one appealed since
3:35 yesterday, when this wa.. writ
ten) is an excellent example of the
products of this machine. Paradoxi
cally, the machine bears a resem
blance to a fine etching, from which,
only so many impressions can be
printed, before the: lines lose their
lustre. Ibis etching wasn't good even
when completed, it's very bad now
that it has been overly used.
This book is, I am told, "a story
of the conflict of wills and ideals of
two women, one thoroughly fine,
the other superficial and wordly
minded, in which all the honors go
to the first." That's what I'm told
it is, here's what it is: inane mawk
ish sentimentality set to a pattern
that lacks any semblance of life.
It's the sort of thing whose Cin
derella flavor will just appeal to the
American shop-girl, to whose in
telligence Mrs. Norris stoops in
writing such work. You know the
ending before you've begun, and
you forget the beginning before you
end it. It extends to 25 chapters,
which bear a singular resemblance
to one another, with their lovely
moral lessons, descriptions of na
ture, and pathetic introspection. In
trospection of the nature in which
Dorothy Dix indulges when she
"looks into a woman's heart."

CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON. B>
Ear! Derr Biggers. I'ohhs-Mcr
ti'l. New V1930.
Fron. London around the world to
Honolulu, Earl Derr Biggers pre
sents murders that bailie Scotland
Yard. There, Inspector Dull, wound
ed in Honolulu by the criminal
whom he had crossed a continent
and ocean to meet, turns his investi
gation over to his old friend, Char
lie Chan.
Broom's hostelry, famous in Lon
don for. its sedate manner of avoid -
im publicity, is the scene of the
first murder. The victim is a mem
ber of Dr. Lofton's round-the-world
tour. Before Ion;.*; every member is
suspected but no one can be ar
rested.
Tl"-- search centers around a key,
two ba" of stones, and a Jim Eve:--
lsard traveling under an alias with
the parly. Du/T is about to "get" his
man when he is wounded. Charlie
Chan joins the party and continues
(he investigation on board the Dol
lar liner sailing for San Francisco.
Shrewd and modest, he nabs the
criminal through the hitter's slip of
description.
Although most of the story takes
place b< fore Charlie arrives on the
scent , he immediately becomes the
major character, solving a murder
mystery, and smoothing the way for
the "happy ending'' of the love af
fair between the two young mem
bers of the party.
Local color, of the type interest
ing to those who have crossed the
Pacific, supplies an excellent setting
for Chan's activities. Not until the
last night out, until the last morn
ing entering San Francisco bay does
the real murderer appear from be
hind his aliajs. —J. N.
