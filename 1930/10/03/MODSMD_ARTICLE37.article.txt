The first day of classes, of hesi
tatings on the brink of the Law
Steps, of being assured that no pro
fessor was ever guilty of a good
intention, is past.
We're all in favor of dedicating
this column to the five-hundred.
After all, the other four-fifths of the
student body must have something
to talk about.
Thousands of years it took to make
A monkey into man.
Give a woman thirty seconds.
And he's back where he begun.
Someone has written a book about
;> student who overworked and went
mildly insane, firmly believing that
he was campus king, and acting it,
too. The overwork sounds doubtful,
and we've never written a book,
but we have seen our local politi
cians at play already this quarter.
The frosh appear just a little bit
younger, each year, and seem to
get by with more ami more ih'.r.;.-,
we never dared do. Sophomore year
in a fraternity house will alter that,
though. Another Hell-Week starts
soon, and lots of the boys \v!!l be
wishing they hadn't learned such a
snappy line of hack-talk in their
spare moments.
They say that the number of
cigarettes sold in the Roble base
ment store is increasing daily, by
leaps and bounds. Ha! Maybe they
do believe in signs, and are "avoid
ing that future shadow."
Or maybe they're just practicing
for the president's reception tonight
when they have their first fling ai.
campus sassicty. (Not fling- -1 mean
crush—no, that doesn't sound right,
cither.)
Anyhow, we're belting someone
told them that sophistication would
get them bj where even the lies!
families of Ugwump would fear (<•
amble, ft would take a lot of • enhis
tication to help some—but why b M
unkind about it?
You never can tell what four
years of college will do for you.
More college girls are waiting table
in summer camps every year.
And now we're beginning to won
der why they didn't put the new
hospital nearer the center of things.
II the bumps on Lasucn get much
worse, someone will start a damage
suit for bruised heads. And that
would be bad. A trifle embarrassing
to be told that your head had been
that way for a long, long time.
We're told that die girls on the
row have taken to raising p-ts. in
their spare time—you know, the
small animal' variety, like dogs and
gold fish and rats and tilings. One
house even beasts of a green, swear
less parrot. Too bad psittacosis has
gone out of style so soon. We might
have had some publicity.
