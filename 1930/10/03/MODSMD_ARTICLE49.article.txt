# SOCCER CANDIDATES RECEIVE EQUIPMENT AT FIRST PRACTICE
## 
### 
Over 40 varsity candidates re
ceived soccer equipment yesterday
afternoon in preparation for the first
practice of the year to be held this
afternoon. With nine lettermen and
many non-lettermen returning to
the squad, prospects for a successful j
season look very bright, although !
there is but little time in which to
whip an eleven into shape before
the first contest on October 11.
Heading the list of outstanding
men who are expected to be the j
mainstays of Coach Harry Maloney's
team this year is Captain Eberhart, !
outside left, a fast driving player
with lots of fight. He looked mighty
good in the interclass series run off
last spring.
Other forwards expected to shine
are, Moheka, who has two years of
previous varsity experience, Nich
olas, and Falk. At center there is
Miller who was a regular at that
position on last year's squad.
Halfbacks include Jackson, Plumb,
Christensen, and Washburn, captain
of the freshman team last year. Dal
ton and Burns are the outstanding
fullbacks, while Brekelbaum, goalie ,
on the 1933 frosh eleven, is the prob
able choice for the net-guarding job.
Manager Whitney Wright has is
sued a call for more tryoutees for
sophomore managers' positions.
Anyone interested should report at
the practice field this afternoon. [
