# NEW HOSPITAL TO OPEN ON CAMPUS EARLY IN MARCH
## Site Donated by Stanford; Palo Alto Financing Entire Project 
### 
Representing an investment which
will total more than half a million
dollars when completed, the new
Stanford-Palo Alto hospital will be
open for occupancy by March 1, ac
cording to K. E. Parker, head of the
firm of contractors in charge of the
construction.
The new building, which is lo
cated on the campus near the en
trance to Palm Drive, will be con
structed of heavily reinforced con
crete entirely fireproof throughout.
The pouring of the concrete is prac
tically finished at the present time,
Parker reports. The building itself
is estimated to cost $350,000 and the
equipment to be installed will bring
the investment over the half mil
lion mark.
The project was financed by the
city of Palo Alto, aided by Stanford
University with the donation of a
site for the building on the campus.
The central location of the new hos
pital will be particularly convenient
for students as well as for Palo Alto
residents.
Parker stated that no expense
would be spared to make the new
hospital one of the most modern in
the country. A complete thermo
statically controlled heating and
ventilating system is being installed
as the general construction prog
resses. In addition, there will be a
refrigeration system with convenient
outlets in various parts of the build
ing.
Unusual facilities for conval
escence will be incorporated in the
provision for spacious sun porches
on the roof of one of the wings. The
main part of the building will be
six stories high.
