# POLO PRACTICE STARTS TODAY 13 VETS BACK
## Captain Gordan Optimistic Over Approaching Season 
### 
With 13 vetei-ans reporting for
, "A" squad, three of whom are letter
men, Captain Gordon declared yes
terday that polo prospects are better
than ever before.
All of which is a rather strong
statement, but a brilliant array of
hard riding players is expected to
report for the initial practice at 1:30
o'clock this afternoon to back up the
coach's claims.
Gorham, back, MacDougal, No. 3,
and Revell, No. 2, are the returning
lettermen who will swing their mal
lets in the first practice this after
noon. MacDougal is the only one
of the trio, however, who is fairly
sure of a place on the varsity four,
according to the captain.
"The others are very nearly on a
par," said Gordan, "and I expect
strong competition for every posi
tion."
This explains one of the principal
reasons for his optimism. With two
or three experienced players battling
for each post, a fine team is sure to
result.
Others besides the trio of letter
men who will report this afternoon
are Booth, Carter, Clausen, Decker,
Howe, von Loben Sels, Spaulding,
Stevick, Fleming and Gillham.
Practice will be held on Friday
afternoons between 1:30 and 4:30
o'clock, and on Monday and Wed
nesday afternoons between 3 and i
4:30 o'clock.
While Oregon State is the only
Pacific Coast college the Cardinal
quartet will meet, Gordan is seeking
the University of Arizona riders for
a series of games to be played here
in December. The Oregon series will
not be played until spring, as usual.
At least two weeks of practice will
precede the first game of the year,
which will be played here. The j
crack Monterey Presidio four will j
probably furnish the competition, j
according to Gordan.
The Monterey soldiers have one i
of the fastest polo aggregations on i
the coast, and a good game is cer
tain to be in store if they are se- j
cured for the opening contest.
Candidates for "B" squad reported I
yesterday afternoon to the captain,
but no practice was held. "B" squad j
is comprised of beginners and play
ers below varsity calibre. Only IG,
or four teams, are carried on "A"' !
squad.
Last year nearly 50 mallet weild- ,
ers played in "B" group.
