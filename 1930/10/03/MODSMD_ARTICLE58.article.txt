# GRAY GRID SQUAD BEING MOLDED FOR TWO-GAME SEASON
## 
### 
Now that Pop Warner's cut in the
varsity football squad has given
them the material to work with,
Coaches Murray Cuddeback and
Don Robesky are getting down to
work on the task of turning out a
Gray eleven which will equal last
year's undefeated aggregation.
To accomplish this object may be
rather easier than in previous years,
since a new Pacific Coast Confer
ence ruling restricts the Grays to
a schedule of only two games. One
of these tilts, with California's Goofs,
will be played November 8, but the
other one has not been decided upon.
More than forty men are listed
on the reserve squad but the men
on whom Cuddeback is counting to
be his first string are the following:
Halfbacks—Afflerbaugh, Deuel, and
Zaches. Quarterbacks —Glover and
Boushey. Fullbacks — Hancock,
Thurmond, and Pierose. Ends—
Tway and Rogers. Tackles—Grib
bin and Scribner. Guards—White,
and Corbus. Centers —Milligan and
Card.
