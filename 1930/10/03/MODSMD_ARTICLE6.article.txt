COLOGNE, Germany, Oct. 2. (TP)
â€”The cornerstone of the new Ford
automobile factory here was laid
this noon by Henry Ford himself,
who amused the assembled digni
taries by removing his overcoat in
order to seize the trowel and put the
stone in place in a workmanlike
manner.
Many guests were present, in
cluding Mayor Adenauer.
"I am convinced that German
workers will do good work here,"
said Mr. Ford as he struck the cor
nerstone three times in accordance
with local custom.
Mayor Adenauer remarked that
(he establishment of the plant signi
fied "forward, upward on the road
to progress" while various Rhenish
industrialists expressed similar sen
timents. One, "made in Germany,"
was especially applauded.
