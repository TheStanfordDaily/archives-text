"There isn't a game on the sched
ule that you men can't win" was
the optimism expressed by Coach
Herbert O. Crislcr as he addressed
his men on the opening day of foot
ball drill.
And now, several weeks later, the
same optimism is present as the
head mentor drives his Minnesota
grid candidates through lengthy
scrimmages against picked freshman
teams.
The various backfield combina
tions used by Crisler in an attempt
to bring out the smooth workings
of a fast charging backfield have
j been developing remarkably well.
! With Captain Win Brockmeyer; Pete
! Somers, accurate passer and flashy
; runner; Paul Kirk, elusive open
field runner, and Jack Manders,
j hailed by grid followers as a worthy
successor to Gopher fullback all—
i Americans — Herb Joesting and
: Bronko Nagurski, Crisler seems to
: have discovered a satisfactory group
capable of causing much worry
| amid the ranks of opposing lines
men and backs.
The Maroon and Gold ends are
coming in for their share of extra
hard drill. Fearful of the powerful
outposts that Pop Warner can throw
to the flanks, Crisler is taking no
chances of having his team's plays
smeared behind the line of scrim
mage.
Because Harold Anderson, first
string right end, was injured in the
South Dakota fray last Saturday
when the Gophers piled up a 48-0
score, the Minnesota tutor has been
using reserve ends in practices not
only to replace Anderson but to
have capable second-stringers who
can be thrown into the field of bat
tle with the calling of a counter
attack.
