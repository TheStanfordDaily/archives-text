NAPLES, Italy, Oct. 2. (A*)â€”la
habitants for miles around gathered
on neighboring hills today to water:
Vesuvius, transformed into a foun
tain of fire and lava by an unner
alded eruption.
With its crater shifted 63 feet,
the volcano shot rocks and lava 300
feet into the air. There were two
fountains of the flaming lava, the
molten fluid being cast in flaming
streams into the sky.
The director of the Vesuvius
observatory said there was no dan
ger from the lava flow, but inhabit
ants thereabout continued their
vigil. Vesuvius has been semi-active
since early in the summer and in
mid-July spread a great stream of
lava over the entire western zone
of the crater.
