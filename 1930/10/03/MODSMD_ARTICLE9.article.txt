# COMMITTEE OF LEAGUE FLAYS KELLOGG PACT
## Harmonious Amendment to League Covenant Is Voted Down 
### 
GENEVA, Oct. 2. (Associated
Press) â€”Efforts to amend the League
of Nations covenant in a form that
would outlaw all war thus making
it harmonious with the Kellogg -
Briand anti-war pact failed tonight
in the League Assembly's judicial
sub-committee by a vote of ten to
two.
Heated discussion preceded the
balloting with the final tally show
ing only Lord Cecil of Great Britain
and Dr. Chao Chu-Wu of China in
favor of accepting immediately
amendments to that end.
Now the question likely will be
held over for another year, since a
resolution adopted by the sub-com
mittee earlier in the day provides
that the amendments be referred to
the member governments in view
of further discussion by the Assem
bly in 1931. The resolution will go
to full committee tomorrow and
probably will be taken before the
Assembly Saturday.
Debate in the sub-committee ap
pears to have been of warm char
acter at times. The Norwegian dele
gate raised a question whether ex
isting treaties such as the Locarno
Pact would not fall to the ground
if the League Covenant were
amended, since it and others like it
are based on the possibility of war
occurring.
Several jurists on the sub-com
mittee including Limburg of Hol
land, said that if war were ruled
out such treaties would be useless,
while Rene Cassin of France and
Henri Rollin of Belgium also pro
tested, saying in that case the Coun
cil sanctions must be increased.
Lord Cecil argued heatedly, as
serting he considered the other
treaties military conventions and
even against the spirit of the cove
nant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.
He insisted the amendments should
be adopted at once.
