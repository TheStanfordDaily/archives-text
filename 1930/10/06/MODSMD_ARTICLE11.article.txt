Both sides of the world claim
Elisabeth Rethberg, celebrated lyr
ic-dramatic soprano of the Metro
politan Opera, who will be heard at
Stanford December 4, in the second
concert of the A.S.S.U. series. She
has been called the "ocean' com
muter," for, her American season in
concert and opera ended, she sails
for Europe to begin another series
there.
Few prima donnas have to their
credit a list of 1000 concert songs in
French, Italian, German, and Eng
lish, and another feat of memory is
the mastery of eighty roles in opera.
Not only is Rethberg a recognized
vocal artist, but a fine pianist. While
singing won the day, Rethberg's
equipment as pianist is of marvel
ous aid, enabling her to study her
concert gongs and opera roles alone.
Season tickets for the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series are now on sale at
the concert office in the Old Union.
Tickets may be called for, beginning
today.
The first attraction of the series
this season is a concert given by the
United States Marine Band, Captain
Taylor Branson leading. The band
stops here on its tour of 62 cities
in 62 days, giving two concerts a
day. There will be both an after
noon matinee and an evening con
cert.
