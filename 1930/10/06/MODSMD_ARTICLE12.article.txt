# PASTOR DISCUSSES ST. PAUL'S LETTER
## 
### 
'The finest hymn of love ever
written by man is contained in the
thirteenth chapter of St. Paul's let
ter to the Corinthians," stated Rev.
Charles Jefferson, pastor of the
Broadway Tabernacle, New York
City, in his sermon in the Memorial
Chapel last night,.
"The chapter is surprising in its
character, authorship, and position,"
Dr. Jefferson said. "We might have
expected such an outburst of mel
ody from Christ, the Teacher of
Love, or from John, the disciple of
love, but we do not expect it from
Paul, the logician and the philo
sopher.
