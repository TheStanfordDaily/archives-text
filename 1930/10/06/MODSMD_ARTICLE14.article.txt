# ENGLAND MOURNS TRAGIC CRASH OF R-101 ON GOOD WILL TOUR TO CALCUTTA
## King George Sends Condolences to Bereaved Families Of Crash Victims; Telegrams Pour in From Nations in All Parts of the World

Oct. 5. (Associated Press)— Shaken as by no other event in
recent years, the British nation today mourned loss of its once proud
mistress of the air, the R-101, giant drigible which Saturday night scuttled
across the murky skies in an appointment with death.
The disaster, the greatest the air has known since the French airship
Dixmude cruised out over the Mediterranean with 52 persons aboard in
December 1923, never to return, occurred as the giant ship, the largest
in the world and sister to the R-100 which visited America last July, sailed

' southeastward across France on a
J trip to India and return.
| A heavy wind and rainstorm
i which the airship encountered
! shortly after it crossed the English
Channel was believed to account
for the disaster. Weighted by the
rain, the dirigible lost buoyancy,
| and finally bumped into the ground
: once or twice south of Beauvais.
: Then it struck a hillside there, and
1 in 10 seconds had caught fire and
I was a blazing inferno.
From throne and pulpit, slums and
i Mayfair, lamentations and condo
' iences went up tonight as British
| hearts, torn as few things have torn
i them since the war, extended the
; sympathies of the nation to sur
i vivors and families of the dead.
Until the final trials before the
I start for India the R-101 had not
| been seen in flight since before last
; Christmas. As late as Wednesday a
! trial flight of the dirigible developed
! a minor defect in the oil cooler,
| which broke down. This was de
i clared not to be due to any struc
i tural defect, and the engines were
j said to have functioned perfectly.
Immediately on receipt of official
I news of the disaster King George
j sent the following telegram from
I Sandringham to Premier MacDon
| aid:
i"I am horrified to hear of this
national disaster which has befallen
| the airship R-101, and the conse-
I quent serious loss of life, including
| that of Lord Thomson, my air min
i ister.
"The Queen and I sympathize
i deeply with the relatives and friends
< of those who have perished in the
j service of their country, and also
with the injured survivors.—George,
R. 1."
