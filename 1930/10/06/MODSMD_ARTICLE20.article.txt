# DEGREES UNIMPORTANT IN EUROPE; MEARS TALKS ON FOREIGN SYSTEM

Some rather striking differences
1 between European and American
universities were noted by Dr. E. G.
Mears, professor of Geography and
International Trade in the Stanlord
School of Business, in a talk before
the Commonwealth Club of San
Francisco Friday noon.
According to Professor Mears, who
has just returned from a 1G months'
tour as a visiting Carnegie profes
sor during which he lectured in
higher educational institutions
throughout the Levant, in Vienna
and in Scotland, in Europe degrees,
so much sought after here, are of
little importance. Many students
leave college without obtaining one
and the possession of one means lit
tle. he said.
Nor do degrees of higher rank
than the bachelor's have any added
significance proportional to their im
portsinee in the United States. A!

Oxford an M.A, may be obtained
after the B.A. by merely continuing
in residence and paying a fee, no
study being required, Dr. Mears de
clared. In Scotland no B.A. is given,
the master's honor being the first
awarded.
European universities are con
ducted solely with regard to the
welfare of the ambitious student
and no attention is paid to the stu
dent who does not intend to study,
according to Professor Mears. This
is in marked contrast to our Ameri
can system in which every student
is forced to do a certain amount of
work in order to avoid flunking out.
Another marked point of differ
ence between colleges on the two
sides of the Atlantic i.s the fact that
lectures mean little in Europe and
attendance is not compulsory. Few
students attend them, Dr. Mears
stated.
