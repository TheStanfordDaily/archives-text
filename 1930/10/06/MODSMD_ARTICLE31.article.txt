# CURBS DEFEAT BRONC ELEVEN BY 20-0 SCORE
## Redshirt Offense Hits Hard To Crush Santa Clara After Bad Start SCORE ON LONG RUNS 
### LEN KULLMANN 
Crushing the Santa Clara Broncos
with a flashing last half attack,
Stanford's varsity football squad
swept to its third victory of the
season Saturday by the score of
20-0.
Held to a scoreless tie during the
first two periods of play by the stub
born defense of the Broncos, the
Cardinal offense lost no time in get
ting under way in the third quarter.
After kicking off and forcing then
opponents to punt, Stanford rolled
up three first downs in a row t<
move from their own 42- to Santa
Clara's 14-yard line.
Clark's fumble following a dive
into tacklers broke up the drive, but
when two plays lost eight yards for
the Broncos, Mettler was forced to
punt. Taking the ball on the 45-
yard line, Moffatt marched back
over the goal line for the first
touchdown, aided by interference
which swept all opponents from his
path. Moffatt's attempt to convert
failed.
After receiving the kick-off fol
lowing the score, Santa Clara failed
to advance and Mettler again punt
ed, this time Moffatt being held to a
five-yard return. Reeling off three
successive first downs, the Stanford
offense was not to be denied. Al
though Rothert's pass to Neill, who
rolled over for a touchdown, was
nullified because of an offside line
man, following an exchange of punts
the Warnermen scored again.
Following a penalty for holding
which put the Redshirts back to
their own 35-yard marker, Moffatt's
25-yard toss was gathered in by
Rothert, who romped the remaining
40 yards to the goal line. Clark re
moved the last man for Harlow and
Moffatt's place kick put the Red
shirts 13 points to the good.
In the final canto, Santa Clara
opened up with a frenzied passing
attack after Haakinson intercepted
Moffatt's forward. Two passes fell
incomplete before Mettler finally
connected Haakinson for an 11-yard
advance, but the green-shirted lads
were forced to punt. Stanford lost
the ball on downs after Wilson, who
replaced Clark, and Moffatt had se
cured a first down on the Broncos'
35, but on the next play Rothert,
gathered in Mettler's fling to travel
55 yards to a touchdown. Harlow
added the extra point a moment
later with a place kick.
Herm Mettler, Bronco left half,
managed the entire Santa Clara of
fense, while Tassi and O'Daniels
showed to advantage in the line.
For Stanford, the work of Moffatt,
Rorthert, Hillman, and Clark in the
backfield was outstanding, while the
whole line worked so well it was
diilicult to pick out any outstanding
men. Ends, tackles, guards, and the
center all seeped through the Santa
Clara line to wreak havoc with at
tempted pass plays, and the inability
of the green-shirted lads to score
more than two first downs on run
ning plays during the course of the
game speaks for the work of the
line.
Injuries took their toll of Red
shirts for the first time this season
when Captain Ray Tandy was taken
from the game before the first pe
riod was five minutes old. Tandy
suffered the recurrence of an old
knee injury, and Stanford will prob
ably enter the Minnesota • game
without the services of her captain.
Carl Wittenau, end, suffered a
broken ear drum, while Guido Ca
glieri was withdrawn from play
during the first quarter after his
injured shoulder had been wrenched.
Tandy's injury is the most serious
blow to Ihe squad, although lank
"Chuck' - Ehrhorn, who took his
place, filled the tackle berth in ex
cellent fashion.
A squad which will numbej' about
thirty-five men will leave for Min
neapolis on Tuesday. Warner is ex
pected to announce the list of men
making the trip after practice today.

Crushing the Santa Clara Broncos
with a flashing last half attack,
Stanford's varsity football squad
swept to its third victory of the
season Saturday by the score of
20-0.
Held to a scoreless tie during the
first two periods of play by the stub
born defense of the Broncos, the
Cardinal offense lost no time in get
ting under way in the third quarter.
After kicking off and forcing then
opponents to punt, Stanford rolled
up three first downs in a row t<
move from their own 42- to Santa
Clara's 14-yard line.
Clark's fumble following a dive
into tacklers broke up the drive, but
when two plays lost eight yards for
the Broncos, Mettler was forced to
punt. Taking the ball on the 45-
yard line, Moffatt marched back
over the goal line for the first
touchdown, aided by interference
which swept all opponents from his
path. Moffatt's attempt to convert
failed.
After receiving the kick-off fol
lowing the score, Santa Clara failed
to advance and Mettler again punt
ed, this time Moffatt being held to a
five-yard return. Reeling off three
successive first downs, the Stanford
offense was not to be denied. Al
though Rothert's pass to Neill, who
rolled over for a touchdown, was
nullified because of an offside line
man, following an exchange of punts
the Warnermen scored again.
Following a penalty for holding
which put the Redshirts back to
their own 35-yard marker, Moffatt's
25-yard toss was gathered in by
Rothert, who romped the remaining
40 yards to the goal line. Clark re
moved the last man for Harlow and
Moffatt's place kick put the Red
shirts 13 points to the good.
In the final canto, Santa Clara
opened up with a frenzied passing
attack after Haakinson intercepted
Moffatt's forward. Two passes fell
incomplete before Mettler finally
connected Haakinson for an 11-yard
advance, but the green-shirted lads
were forced to punt. Stanford lost
the ball on downs after Wilson, who
replaced Clark, and Moffatt had se
cured a first down on the Broncos'
35, but on the next play Rothert,
gathered in Mettler's fling to travel
55 yards to a touchdown. Harlow
added the extra point a moment
later with a place kick.
Herm Mettler, Bronco left half,
managed the entire Santa Clara of
fense, while Tassi and O'Daniels
showed to advantage in the line.
For Stanford, the work of Moffatt,
Rorthert, Hillman, and Clark in the
backfield was outstanding, while the
whole line worked so well it was
diilicult to pick out any outstanding
men. Ends, tackles, guards, and the
center all seeped through the Santa
Clara line to wreak havoc with at
tempted pass plays, and the inability
of the green-shirted lads to score
more than two first downs on run
ning plays during the course of the
game speaks for the work of the
line.
Injuries took their toll of Red
shirts for the first time this season
when Captain Ray Tandy was taken
from the game before the first pe
riod was five minutes old. Tandy
suffered the recurrence of an old
knee injury, and Stanford will prob
ably enter the Minnesota • game
without the services of her captain.
Carl Wittenau, end, suffered a
broken ear drum, while Guido Ca
glieri was withdrawn from play
during the first quarter after his
injured shoulder had been wrenched.
Tandy's injury is the most serious
blow to Ihe squad, although lank
"Chuck' - Ehrhorn, who took his
place, filled the tackle berth in ex
cellent fashion.

with a flashing last half attack,
Stanford's varsity football squad
swept to its third victory of the
season Saturday by the score of
20-0.
Held to a scoreless tie during the
first two periods of play by the stub
born defense of the Broncos, the
Cardinal offense lost no time in get
ting under way in the third quarter.
After kicking off and forcing then
opponents to punt, Stanford rolled
up three first downs in a row t<
move from their own 42- to Santa
Clara's 14-yard line.
Clark's fumble following a dive
into tacklers broke up the drive, but
when two plays lost eight yards for
the Broncos, Mettler was forced to
punt. Taking the ball on the 45-
yard line, Moffatt marched back
over the goal line for the first
touchdown, aided by interference
which swept all opponents from his
path. Moffatt's attempt to convert
failed.
After receiving the kick-off fol
lowing the score, Santa Clara failed
to advance and Mettler again punt
ed, this time Moffatt being held to a
five-yard return. Reeling off three
successive first downs, the Stanford
offense was not to be denied. Al
though Rothert's pass to Neill, who
rolled over for a touchdown, was
nullified because of an offside line
man, following an exchange of punts
the Warnermen scored again.
Following a penalty for holding
which put the Redshirts back to
their own 35-yard marker, Moffatt's
25-yard toss was gathered in by
Rothert, who romped the remaining
40 yards to the goal line. Clark re
moved the last man for Harlow and
Moffatt's place kick put the Red
shirts 13 points to the good.
In the final canto, Santa Clara
opened up with a frenzied passing
attack after Haakinson intercepted
Moffatt's forward. Two passes fell
incomplete before Mettler finally
connected Haakinson for an 11-yard
advance, but the green-shirted lads
were forced to punt. Stanford lost
the ball on downs after Wilson, who
replaced Clark, and Moffatt had se
cured a first down on the Broncos'
35, but on the next play Rothert,
gathered in Mettler's fling to travel
55 yards to a touchdown. Harlow
added the extra point a moment
later with a place kick.
Herm Mettler, Bronco left half,
managed the entire Santa Clara of
fense, while Tassi and O'Daniels
showed to advantage in the line.
For Stanford, the work of Moffatt,
Rorthert, Hillman, and Clark in the
backfield was outstanding, while the
whole line worked so well it was
diilicult to pick out any outstanding
men. Ends, tackles, guards, and the
center all seeped through the Santa
Clara line to wreak havoc with at
tempted pass plays, and the inability
of the green-shirted lads to score
more than two first downs on run
ning plays during the course of the
game speaks for the work of the
line.
Injuries took their toll of Red
shirts for the first time this season
when Captain Ray Tandy was taken
from the game before the first pe
riod was five minutes old. Tandy
suffered the recurrence of an old
knee injury, and Stanford will prob
ably enter the Minnesota • game
without the services of her captain.
Carl Wittenau, end, suffered a
broken ear drum, while Guido Ca
glieri was withdrawn from play
during the first quarter after his
injured shoulder had been wrenched.
Tandy's injury is the most serious
blow to Ihe squad, although lank
"Chuck' - Ehrhorn, who took his
place, filled the tackle berth in ex
cellent fashion.
A squad which will numbej' about
thirty-five men will leave for Min
neapolis on Tuesday. Warner is ex
pected to announce the list of men
making the trip after practice today.
