Across the bay at Iserkeley. the editor of The Daily Calif omian
is attempting to arouse spirit against Stanford s placing the Axe
in a bank vault. I nder the heading "The Axe Is Much 100 llig
and Virile to lie Hidden llehind Swain's Petticoats." the editor
declares the Stanford administration is playing nursemaid to the
student body so it won't hurt itself.
Any justifiable argument the Califoniian executive might have
used probably would have stood the test of analysis, but when the
temperament of California students is considered, it is clearly un
derstood whv Stanford refuses to allow exhibition of the Axe.
Intercollegiate competition between the two universities is at stake
when marauders from either institution invade the respective campi.
I nfortunatelv the editor ot Ihe Daily C aliforniau has been
forced twice already to admit the unsoundness of his editorial cam
paign. I'irst. his misinformed attack on the junior college system;
second, his approval of comment in bis columns attacking the
Xative Sons and Daughters—both have caused him grief.
The Stanford Axe is liable to result in another fiasco for the
('aliforniau.
While the Califomian editor stews in a turmoil attempting to
arouse feeling, authorities at both institutions believe Acting Presi
dent Robert K. Swain's action in locking up the Axe is to the best
advantage of all concerned.
When student leaders of California and Stanford can come to
terms and determine a definite policy as to the disposal of the Axe,
then can the weapon be placed on exhibition.
