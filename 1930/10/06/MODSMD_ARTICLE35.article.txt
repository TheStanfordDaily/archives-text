# THAT SCHOLASTIC STANDING
## 
### 
Stanford women arc better.students than Stanford men. Roble
residents are better students than sorority members. .Men living in
dormitories are better students than those living in fraternities. At
least, scholastic standings released by the Registrar's office indicate
as much. These standings are obtained by finding the ratio of the
total number of grade points to the total number of registered units
for each group.
The inmates of Roble and the sororities lead the men in scho
lastic ranking by .321 of a point, the women's average being 1 .817
and the men's 1 .490. The general I'niversity average for last year
was 1 .545. which is .049 of a point above the men's average, lie
fore concluding that Stanford women are more intelligent than
Stanford men. it should be remembered that there are more than
live times as many men as women considered in the scholastic in
\ est igation.
Roble residents had an average for last year of 1 .839. while
sororitv members had an average of 1 .776. Men living in the resi
dence halls had a scholastic ranking of 1.547. a> compared with
1.404 for fraternity men. Oulv one of the 10 sororities had a
scholastic mark below the general I'niversity average: 21 fraterni
ties were below this average.
< )f the men's athletic teams, only the varsity track and the
freshman tennis squads had marks below the general I'niversity
average. In general, the freshman teams had lower averages for the
autumn quarter than for the two following ones. The scholastic
average for the freshman football team was decidedly lower during
the autumn quarter, when the first year gridsters were engaging in
actual competition, than during the two succeeding quarters'
All of which proves, in all probability, nothing at all.
