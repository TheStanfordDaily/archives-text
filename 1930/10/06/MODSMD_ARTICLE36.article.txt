Stanford's hymn is difficult to sing; but it is this very diflicult
ness that makes it one of the outstanding college hymns. It is
mighty, glorious, and impressive—when well sung.
Hut it sounds feeble and Hat when the students mouth the words
as they did in Friday's assembly. Learn the melody, the words, and
then join in heartily when it i> sung next time. The words follow:
Where the rolling foothills rise
l 'p toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the (.'oast Range lies.
In the sunset fire.
Flushing deep and paling,
1 (ere we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring.
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Ilail, Stanford, llail!
Hail, Stanford. Hail!
