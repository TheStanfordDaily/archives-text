THIS PURE YOUNG MAN. By Ir
ving Finenian. New Vork, Ifl.'JO.
(At the Palo Alio Hook Shop)
A little intelligence is a dangerous
thing.
So discovers Roger Bendrow, who
in "This Pure Young Man" is en
dowed by Author Irving Fineman
with this somewhat unnecessary
quality, plus a purity which makes
this tawdry world no place tor him.
Pie was too pure for amorous tri
fling. too pure for any but his one
love, his lofty ideals. He was much
too pure for social recognition or
financial success. He lived as he
died, dreaming. Yet in spite of it all
he was what we might call a "swell
guy." His only fault was that he
didn't belong here.
It is with a kindly and under
standing eye that Fineman in this,
his first novel, observes the unsuc
cessful career of his knight-errant
hero to his death in an ether-dream
on an operating table.
Minutely the author contrasts
Roger with his boyhood friend,
Harry Jar vis, who loves women,
1 wealth, action, and always gets what
he wants. With no capacity for truth
or beauty, he finds many friends, is
enormously successful, immensely
| happy.
This volume was awarded first
J prize of $7500 by the Longmans,
Green publishing company for the
| best novel among twelve hundred

submitted in its 1930 fiction contest.

THE LONE KIDEK—At the Varsity
Theater
With Buck Jones playing the lead
of the Lone Rider, it qualifies as a
regulation western love story. Buck
Jones takes the part of a bandit,
Jim, who, when about to rob the
stage coach, reforms and protects
the beautiful girl and takes her and
the gold safely to her father. Later,
when the girl's father believes that
Jim has double-crossed them and
has stolen some gold, he overcomes
the villain, throws him into the
river, staggers back to the house of
the beautiful girl, and is just in
time to fall fainting and forgiven
into the girl's arms,"while the father
softly closes the door upon them.
Yes, quite the typical western story.
On the same program is also' the
Break Up, which is a travel film of
a journey across Alaska. It has no
plot, but the pictures open up the
great trackless wastes of Alaska and
show a great many strange things.
The route of the party is up the
coast, across the mainland to the
Yukon, whence to the sea, and the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.
The best pictures are those of the
spring "Break Up" after which the
picture is named. As a picture
which is simply a record, it is more
enjoyable and informing than most
pictures of its kind.

THE LONE KIDEK—At the Varsity
Theater
With Buck Jones playing the lead
of the Lone Rider, it qualifies as a
regulation western love story. Buck
Jones takes the part of a bandit,
Jim, who, when about to rob the
stage coach, reforms and protects
the beautiful girl and takes her and
the gold safely to her father. Later,
when the girl's father believes that
Jim has double-crossed them and
has stolen some gold, he overcomes
the villain, throws him into the
river, staggers back to the house of
the beautiful girl, and is just in
time to fall fainting and forgiven
into the girl's arms,"while the father
softly closes the door upon them.
Yes, quite the typical western story.
On the same program is also' the
Break Up, which is a travel film of
a journey across Alaska. It has no
plot, but the pictures open up the
great trackless wastes of Alaska and
show a great many strange things.
The route of the party is up the
coast, across the mainland to the
Yukon, whence to the sea, and the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.
The best pictures are those of the
spring "Break Up" after which the
picture is named. As a picture
which is simply a record, it is more
enjoyable and informing than most
pictures of its kind.
THIS PURE YOUNG MAN. By Ir
ving Finenian. New Vork, Ifl.'JO.
(At the Palo Alio Hook Shop)
A little intelligence is a dangerous
thing.
So discovers Roger Bendrow, who
in "This Pure Young Man" is en
dowed by Author Irving Fineman
with this somewhat unnecessary
quality, plus a purity which makes
this tawdry world no place tor him.
Pie was too pure for amorous tri
fling. too pure for any but his one
love, his lofty ideals. He was much
too pure for social recognition or
financial success. He lived as he
died, dreaming. Yet in spite of it all
he was what we might call a "swell
guy." His only fault was that he
didn't belong here.
It is with a kindly and under
standing eye that Fineman in this,
his first novel, observes the unsuc
cessful career of his knight-errant
hero to his death in an ether-dream
on an operating table.
Minutely the author contrasts
Roger with his boyhood friend,
Harry Jar vis, who loves women,
1 wealth, action, and always gets what
he wants. With no capacity for truth
or beauty, he finds many friends, is
enormously successful, immensely
| happy.
