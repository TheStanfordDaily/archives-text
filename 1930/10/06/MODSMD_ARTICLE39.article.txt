WHY (JET SO ANXIOUS?
The Editor, Sir:
Since this morning's paper voiced
so cordial an invitation to all those
who might wish to air their woes,
I take this early opportunity to
complain of an outstanding annoy
ance. I refer to the Ink and Pen
wiper room of the University Li
brary.
For the past two months this es
tablishment lias been closed to the
general public; and a sign "Closed
for Repairs" has been gracing the
door. Perhaps it is a gigantic hoax,
for surely so small a compartment
does not need so much repairs. I
refuse to consider the rumor that
it is to be upholstered in green
satin —or perchance 'tis a nefarious
plot, to induce impoverished stu
dents to throw away their pennies
on ink.
I do not believe so deplorable a
situation should be tolerated for an
other instant, Mr. Editor—what are
you going to do about it?

TRANSFER APPRECIATES
STANFORD
The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps you would like to know
a Senior transfer's reactions to the
welcome your University gave him.
Too, perhaps a great many of the
students don't realize just how
grand their school really is, since
they have come here as Frosh, re
ceived that welcome, and taken it
for granted; but not so with a trans
fer.
Of course, the beauty of the cam
pus, and of the buildings, must re
ceive its share of glory, but what
impressed me was the spirit of
friendliness and of helpfulness
which permeated everyone. On ' cir
cus" day, when things were so con
fusing, my questions were even an
ticipated by some amicable student,
anxious to assist me, and to prevent
me from miles of needless wander
ings.
Whatever is the object of this
friendliness, and I believe it is only
the desire to "Stanfordize" one, 1
am truly grateful to that "Spirit."

cus" day, when things were so con
fusing, my questions were even an
ticipated by some amicable student,
anxious to assist me, and to prevent
me from miles of needless wander

Whatever is the object of this
friendliness, and I believe it is only
the desire to "Stanfordize" one, 1
am truly grateful to that "Spirit."

WHY (JET SO ANXIOUS?
The Editor, Sir:
Since this morning's paper voiced
so cordial an invitation to all those
who might wish to air their woes,
I take this early opportunity to
complain of an outstanding annoy
ance. I refer to the Ink and Pen
wiper room of the University Li
brary.
For the past two months this es
tablishment lias been closed to the
general public; and a sign "Closed
for Repairs" has been gracing the
door. Perhaps it is a gigantic hoax,
for surely so small a compartment
does not need so much repairs. I
refuse to consider the rumor that
it is to be upholstered in green
satin —or perchance 'tis a nefarious
plot, to induce impoverished stu
dents to throw away their pennies
on ink.
I do not believe so deplorable a
situation should be tolerated for an
other instant, Mr. Editor—what are
you going to do about it?

TRANSFER APPRECIATES
STANFORD
The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps you would like to know
a Senior transfer's reactions to the
welcome your University gave him.
Too, perhaps a great many of the
students don't realize just how
grand their school really is, since
they have come here as Frosh, re
ceived that welcome, and taken it
for granted; but not so with a trans
fer.
Of course, the beauty of the cam
pus, and of the buildings, must re
ceive its share of glory, but what
impressed me was the spirit of
friendliness and of helpfulness
which permeated everyone. On ' cir
cus" day, when things were so con
fusing, my questions were even an
ticipated by some amicable student,
anxious to assist me, and to prevent
me from miles of needless wander
ings.
Whatever is the object of this
friendliness, and I believe it is only
the desire to "Stanfordize" one, 1
am truly grateful to that "Spirit."
