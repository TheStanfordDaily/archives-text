Each of us has had at least one
Stanford week-end, now, and some
of us have learned a lot since the
last class on Friday.
The freshmen know how now to
expect an army of people who don't
belong, at every dance of the Jolly-
Up nature. Or maybe no one had the
heart to tell them that seven-eighths
of the nonchalant men at the re
ception dance were sophomores and
, not heroes-to-be of 1934.
Some of the " new-comers
learned a harder lesson. Four
of them asked a Row man the
way to the President's house.
When last seen they were plod
ding along the road to May
field. squeaking new black shoes,
much be-brilliantincd hair, and
all. For identification, look for
a hoy with a blistered heel.
Someone directed the traditional
Youngest Freshman to the new
Theta Dolt house. "Ohâ€”but I
thought that was the campus bus
terminal . . ."
The Fijis have learned that char
ity begins at home, we hope. At any
rate, they certainly ought to hire a
singing master .for their noisiest
brothers, who were feeling so happy,
early Saturday morning, that they
had to tell the sorority houses about
it, in song.
Which reminds us that one of this
University's howling needs is a big
ger and broader music department.
Anyone who heard the so-called
singing of the Stanford hymn at the
assembly last Friday, can tell you
that. A yell-leader is chosen to lead
cheers and "sky-rockets." Why em
barrass him with Ihe duties of a
choir-leader?
And that, in turn, brings us
to the man (not a college pro
fessor, this time) whose little
son asked, "Why rlo frogs
croak?" "Well," he answered,
"You really can't expect thein
to live forever.''
Some statistics compiled at the
Santa Clara game:
One lost ehild, red-headed and
freckled; four claimants for same,
various colors. Five thousand or
more lost hopes, ranging from card
. inal to black. Seven hundred fifty
women who enjoy football; 1500
women who enjrty showing off new
sport clothes at a football game.
Two hundred parents making un
successful attempts to conceal their
pride in "Johnny's making good."
j Uncounted thousands of misses,

, ages from 14 to 34, who attend
simply to watch one boy ("Oh. you
great, big. wonderful man!") per
form.
One coach who's pretty well
satisfied: another who wonders
