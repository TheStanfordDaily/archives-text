That surprisingly good showing
made by the Stanford Frosh Satur
day speaks well for future Card ,
varsities. We liked the babe back
field of Lipscomb, Maentz, White, j
and Hillman. With the two halves,
White and Maentz, garnering gobs
of yardage on reverses; Lipscomb
punching through the line for need
ed advances; and the younger Hill- j
man breaking out in a rash of 40-
yard punts, little more could be de
sired. And the youthful line was
plenty hard to dent, too —for the
Colts' only score was obtained on a
pass.
Good old Herman Mettler was
the Santa Clara backfield again, j
Besides carrying the Ikill IS times j
to the combined total of the other
hacks, 17 tries. Mettler did the punt
ing and passing for the Broncos.
There seems to be no substitute for ;
Herman, at least as far as Santa
Clara is concerned.
Stanford's first quick kick since j
Lord knows when went off in great
style. Coming with Formation C
with Moffatt kicking and Hillman ■
holding, the ball went from Stan- j
ford's 36-yard line to Santa Clara's
5 for a 5!)-yard total. It was the \
ihird play of the game, after the
Cards had received the kick-off and
two line plays had failed.
Clipper Smith has certainly drilled
a machine-like precision into his
squad. Most striking is the way the
players on the bench arise in unison
to applaud a teammate leaving the ;
field, and the five steps the Santa
Clara center takes from the ball be
fore the team arranges its forma- ;
tion. This business of having the !
quarterback whisper to his lines- j
men looks very impressive, too. |
While it was too had that Caglieri |
could not remain in the game longer,
his departure nevertheless put Bill
Clark in his proper environment—
the first string backfield. Little Bill
is as hard a working player as one
finds, and his play Saturday was
brilliant. Taking men out of the
play for another hack never seems !
to bring I*ill headlines, hut without
him in the game'the reverses suffer, i
I
Santa Clara's passing attack did j
not function any too well against
the Redshirts. Attempting 12 tosses, j
the Broncos completed 2 for a total
Of 13 yards gain. Two were inter- j
cepted, one by Hillman who went |
45 yards with the ball before being ;
knocked out of bounds, and one by j
Rothert who went 55 yards to a |
touchdown; eight passes fell incom- j
pleto. In attempting to pass, Mettler ,
was dumped numerous times for ;
losses ranging from 4 to 13 yards.
For the first time in many moons,
Lcland Stanford was penalized more 1
than the prune-pickers. Officials as
sessed the Warnermen 46 yards, in
cluding 15 yards for holding and 15
yards for incomplete passes; Santa
Clara was fined 35 yards for hold
ing, roughing, and incompleted j
passes.
The press box became a mecca for
lost boys Saturday. Besides the j
young man's plea which was voiced
by Liebendorfer over the public ad- ,
dress system (yes. he was reclaimed ,
by fond parents in the nick of time, i
for the benefit of the curious who
craned their necks to look), another
more tearful lad likewise found his
way to the top of the stadium, where
his fears were allayed. —L. K., Jr.
