# Card Babes Corral Colts In Rapid 7-6 Contest
## STANFORD FROSH SNATCH WIN FROM BRONCO YEARLINGS Babes Play Like Veterans, Maentz, White, And Hillman Shine 
### 
Playing like a team of veterans,
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's freshman
eleven fought the Santa Clara year
lings to a 7-6 victory in the pre
liminary game in the Stadium Sat
urday.
For freshmen in early season
form, both teams handled the
l"all with the smoothness of a var
sity outfit in mid-season. Though
the youngsters were running intri
cate reverse plays and gaining much
of their yardage over the aerial
route, fumbles or sluggish passing
were not on the program.
Through the first half the two
outfits looked evenly matched, nei
ther being able to gain consistently
through the other's line, leaving
the edge to be gained in punting
and Gassing.
This advantage the Bronco babes
proceeded to grab in the second
quarter, the result being Santa
Clara's six points. With Hillman
better than holding his own for the
Cards on an exchange of punts in
the first quarter, neither team made
any scoring threats.
At the beginning of the second
period with Stanford in possession
of the ball on her own thirty-yard
line, the Card babes' attempt to
kick on second down was blocked
and recovered by the Broncos. From
here the Santa Clarans completed
two beautiful passes, Weisinger to
McCoy, for the first score, missing
the try for an extra point.
The Stanford score came early
in the second half, when the Santa
Clara line began to weaken to the
smashing of Maentz, Hillman, and
White. The Card yearlings marched
from their own forty-yard line to
within eight yards of the Bronco
goal, where Maentz on a run skirt
ing left end put the ball over for
six points, adding another a mo
ment later with a boot square be
tween the uprights.
For the remainder of the second
half the play was mostly in Santa
Clara territory, the Cards threaten
ing the Bronco goal several times
by virtue of the aerial work of
Maentz, Hillman, and Monsalve.
