## Minnesota Prepares Attack To Meet Stanford in Game Saturday

(Editor's Nolo.â€”This is the sec
ond of a series of articles by
Fred Fadell, sporls editor of the
University of Minnesota Daily.)
Fearful of Stanford's rangy wing
men and last, accurate passers,
Coach Herbert O. (Fritz) Crisler is
practically confining his efforts in
daily practices to the art of smear
ing pass plays behind the line of
scrimmage.
In preparation for ihe Vanderbill
intersectional game here Saturday,
Crisler is practicing the same meth- ;
ods as he is vising against Stanford.
Long instruction in hard driving
against opposing back's and complete
coverage of wandering flankmen is
being moled out l<> maroon and gold
candidates.
Plans Attack Also
But Crisler figures that holding
another team to a minimum of com
pleted forward passes won t win a
game. He realizes that touchdowns
count, and the more the better.
For this reason, the head mentor
is finding time to send a picked
squad of varsity men against a
heavy combination of freshmen in
line smash formation.
The passing game is also coming
in for serious consideration as six .
ends rcceive individual instruction
in chasing over the chalk marks to
open territory and bobbing up in
time to snatch passes.
Passes "Synch"
Synchronizing the throwing and
receiving ends of the throws is be
coming less ol a problem as prac
tice sessions progress.
Crisler has given every indication
that a vigorous aerial attack will be
launched against Vanderbilt and
Stanford as the Gophers enter the
recognized climax of the 1930 sea
son.
