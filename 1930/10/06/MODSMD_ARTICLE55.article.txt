# MATERIAL IS GOOD FOR SOCCER TEAM; FROSH SQUAD WEAK
## 
### 
With more than 40 men turning
out for the first practice of the
year, held Friday afternoon, Coach
Harry Maloney has an encouraging
outlook with regard to varsity soc
cer for the coming season. Included
in the candidates who showed up
are 10 lettermen from last year's
squad, and there are a number of
likely looking prospects from among
the non-lettermen of the 1929 var
sity squad and from the frosh
eleven. âœ“
The first game for both varsity
and freshman teams is scheduled
for October 11 with an opponent as
yet unannounced.
The turnout of freshmen last Fri
day was somewhat disappointing,
according to Maloney, although he
expects to unearth some more ma
terial from the personnel of the gym
classes. There was the same diffi
culty in making up a freshman team
last year, but this season the scarc
ity of candidates seems even more
pronounced.
Maloney attributes this to the
steadily decreasing size of the fresh
man class. Most of the frosh ath
letes go out for football in the fall,
and when some 70 men are sub
tracted from a class of 350 it doesn't
leave a great many who arc quali
fied for stiff athletic competition to
be distributed among the other
sports, swimming, track, tennis,
fencing, boxing, etc.
