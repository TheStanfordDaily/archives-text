# MATRICULATION SERVICES HELD
## Deans Yost, Culver Speak To New Students 
### 
Approximately 225 new students
attended, in a body, the impressive
Matriculation Service which was
held in their honor in the Memorial
Church yesterday morning.
Miss Mary Yost, Dean of Women,
addressing the new members of the
University, stressed the importance
of choosing group leaders of high
character and ability. A young man
or woman who follows the whims of
his adherents, and does not con
tribute his own individual ideas
and personality to the group is not
the proper sort of leader, according
to Miss Yost.
George Bliss Culver, Dean of
Men, spoke of the readjustment of
ideas and attitudes necessary on the
part of the student just entering a
university. New ideas, a great many
of them contrary to those he has
already leraned, will present them
selves to the new student, and he
should receive, them with an open,
unbiased mind.
