# DON LIEBENDORFER LEAVES TO BOOST CARD-GOPHER GAME
## 
### 
With a view toward bolstering the
reported small advance sale of tick
ets for the Stanford-Minnesota foot
ball game next Saturday, Don Lie
bendorfer, publicity director of the
Board of Athletic Control, left for
Minneapolis Saturday evening after
the Santa Clara game.
Only 20,000 tickets have been sold
so far for the Card-Gopher clash,
and as the stadium in Minneapolis
scats (50.000 this is considered a poor
showing. Part of the public lack of
interest is believed to be due to lack
of confidence of Minnesota followers
in the new Gopher coach, Frit/.
Crisler, and it is feared that the
defeat of Minnesota by Vanderbilt
last Saturday by a 33-7 score will
further discourage interest.
