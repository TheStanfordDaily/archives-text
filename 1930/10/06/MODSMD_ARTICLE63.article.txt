Applications for Rhodes scholar
ships for next year are due October
18, according to an announcement
by Dr. A. T. Murray, from whom
application blanks and further in
formation may be obtained at his
oflice, Room 257.
This year a new system of dis
trict elections has been put into ef
fect, by which it is possible for a
state to receive two scholarships in
stead of being restricted to one as
heretofore. The nation has been di
vided into eight districts of six states
each. Every state may nominate
two men and Irom the twelve thus
selected the district committee will
choose four for the scholarships,
without regard to state origins. A
candidate may apply either in his
home state or in that in which he
luis attended college for two years.
Eligibility for a Rhodes scholar
ship requires that a candidate be a
male citizen of the United States,
unmarried, between the ages of 19
and 25, who has completed at least
his sophomore year in college.
Qualities that are considered in
making selections include, besides
scholarship, excellence in manhood
and fellowship, moral force and
leadership, and physical vigor as
shown in outdoor sports or other
wise.
