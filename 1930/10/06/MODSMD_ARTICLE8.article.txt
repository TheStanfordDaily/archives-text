# PIONEERS ASTOUNDED AT GOLF MANIACS

### 
WINNIPEG, Oct. 5. </P)—Out in
the far north, where men are men
and women are scarce, old timers
are sad and shaken.
They have got used to airplanes,
auto ti'actors, outboard motors, and
other noisy products of modern
civilization, but they were not pre
pared for the latest advance of big
city customs in the great open
spaces.
This was the Flin Flon four hole
golf course laid out on the bed of a
lake near the famous Flin Flon
mines in northern Manitoba.
So now pioneer prospectors,
tanned and bearded, stand amazed
as they watch members of their
own sex, garbed in fancy clothes,
clouting a little ball with odd look
ing tools until it is chased down a
hole. Then it is solemnly picked
up and poked patiently into another
hole.
