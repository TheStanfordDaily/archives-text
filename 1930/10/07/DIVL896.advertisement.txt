Old Cap Bi uenose
|
This salty old sea-serpent, or
some others like him, were
responsible for our business
being started in 1836. The
Cap and his friends were
fishermen and whalemen of
New England. They were
tough. And they needed rough,
tough slickers. So Tower
started making them, and has
been at it ever since.
Not all our slickers are cut
on seafaring lines, though.
From the "Varsity," long,
full-lined; through the
"Topper," smartly tailored;
to the "Kitcoat," a linen-thin
featherweight, Fish Brand
Slickers are outstanding in
appearance, unequaled in en
durance. Sold everywhere.
Look for the fish on the label.
