123,000 tests n. year
In the Crane testing laboratories, the
weight arm of a specially designed ma- ;
chine measures the steadily increasing
load suspended from a small cylinder of
metal. Watching it intently is a man who
has at his command instruments that
measure to .00005 of an inch. The cylin
der begins to yield ; he notes the weight.
It snaps; he notes the weight. Disen
gaging it, he measures the stretch and
diameter at the breaking point. These
tests form a part of the 1 23,000 determi
nations Crane Co. makes on its own ma
terials every year.
63,000 of the tests are chemical; not one
component from pig iron to limestone
flux is charged in a Crane melting furnace
whose suitability has not been determined
by analysis. 60,000 are physical; not
one hour's melt is drawn off in a Crane
foundry whose physical properties —ten-
sile, transverse, and torsional strengths,
yield point, breaking point, elongation,
and reduction of area are not known.
1
By such exhaustive tests and by re
searches ofscientists in Crane laboratories,
a vast body of authoritative data on metals
and their properties has been collected.
1 r is embodied in a book, " Pioneering in
Science," which is an invaluable reference
book for students. On request, we will
send it to you.

123,000 tests n. year
In the Crane testing laboratories, the
weight arm of a specially designed ma- ;
chine measures the steadily increasing
load suspended from a small cylinder of
metal. Watching it intently is a man who
has at his command instruments that
measure to .00005 of an inch. The cylin
der begins to yield ; he notes the weight.
It snaps; he notes the weight. Disen
gaging it, he measures the stretch and
diameter at the breaking point. These
tests form a part of the 1 23,000 determi
nations Crane Co. makes on its own ma
terials every year.
63,000 of the tests are chemical; not one
component from pig iron to limestone
flux is charged in a Crane melting furnace
whose suitability has not been determined
by analysis. 60,000 are physical; not
one hour's melt is drawn off in a Crane
foundry whose physical properties —ten-
sile, transverse, and torsional strengths,
yield point, breaking point, elongation,
and reduction of area are not known.
1
By such exhaustive tests and by re
searches ofscientists in Crane laboratories,
a vast body of authoritative data on metals
and their properties has been collected.
1 r is embodied in a book, " Pioneering in
Science," which is an invaluable reference
book for students. On request, we will
send it to you.
