### 
BOSTON, Oct. G (Associated
Press). â€”Cheered in two addresses
before the American Legion and the
American Federation of Labor,
President Hoover today called for
nation-wide team work to end the
business depression and denied the
existence of imperialistic ambitions
by the people of American.
"The demonstration of nation
wide cooperation and team play and
the absence of conflict during this
depression have increased the sta
bility and wholesomeness of our in
dustrial and social structure," Hoov
er said at the Fiftieth Annual Con
vention of the Labor Federation held
in the auditorium of the Hotel
Statlcr.
Coal Industry Suiters
He asserted expansion of con
struction and freedom from strikes
and lockouts had contributed greatly
to lessening unemployment. Turn
ing to the bituminous coal industry
for specific remarks he held that it
was suffering most from readjust
ment made by new discoveries and
labor saving devices and added that
"destructive competition and bi'eak
down in wages" had severely handi
capped it.
Six thousand independent mine
owners, he said, were operating 1000
mines and he urged elimination of
this "destructive competition" as
"one key" to the solution.
President Cheered
Earlier in the day a few hours
after his arrival from the capital the
chief executive received an en
thusiastic demonstration from the
American Legion. He spoke in the
Boston Arena where two years ago
to the day he spoke during his pre
election campaign. Thousands of
Legionnaires interrupted the Presi
dent repeatedly as he asserted that
the "peace of our country has never
stood more assured than at this
moment."
Before the Legionnaires the pres
ent chief executive shared his ac
claim with his predecessor, Calvin
Coolidge, who sat on the platform
beside him as an honorary chairman
of the Legion. The former president
was cheered as Hoover diverted
from his prepared manuscript to pay
tribute to "my eminent predecessor"
to whom he gave credit for carry
ing through with great success dur
ing his administration" the Kcllogg-
Briand Pact for the outlawing of
war.
