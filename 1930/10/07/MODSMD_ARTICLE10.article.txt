# SIMONS SHOWS DIFFERENCES IN LAW EDUCATION
## Noted Jurist Points Out Greater Length of German Methods 
### 
"The chief difference between the
legal and judicial systems of Ger
many and America is the method of
education," declared Dr. Walter C.
Simons in a lecture given yesterday
in the Little Theatre.
Dr. Simons, former Chief Justice
of the German Supreme Court and
former Acting President of the Re
public, lectured on "The Situation
of Bar and Bench in Germany as
compared with that in America,"
given under the auspices of the
Committee of Public Exercises and
the School of Law. He was intro
duced by Dean A. M. Cathcart of
the Lav/ School.
Eight College Years
After completing his regular
lower school and gymnasium
course," continued Dr. Simons, "the
judicial student must spend from
six to eight years in a university
and then four to five years as a
member of the preliminary court
service. He is then ready to take
the Great State Examination. On
passing this he becomes an as
sessor, which is a non-paying post
that the student must hold until
there is a vacancy on the bench.
As there are far too many judges
in Germany it is a long time before
he becomes a member of the Judi
ciary."
According to Dr. Simons the law
yer must go through the same
course. He also stated that a lawyer
very rarely becomes a judge due
to the difference in education and
the fact that a lawyer is very well
paid and a judge very poorly.
Judges Poorly Paid
"All Germany's judges," declared
Dr. Simons, "are appointed by the
executives of the various states. I
am hoping that the Judiciary will
soon receive better pnv so that it
will become as attractive a profes
sion as that of law."
Both Dr. Simons and Professor
Cathcart stressed the return of the
traditional attitude of friendship be
tween America and Germany.
