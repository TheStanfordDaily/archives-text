# LARGE ANTS TO BE EATEN EXCLUSIVELY
## 
### 
BOSTON, Oct. 6. (/P)â€”These are
days of tribulation for desert
iguanas, horned toads, and rattle
snakes. Several iguanas and toads,
creatures of the menagerie brougnt
by the Arizona delegation, will cat
nothing but large rod ants. The
supply brought from home has been
exhausted and none are to be found
in Boston. The snakes are anxious
for their diet of flies, the stock of
which must be replenished at once.
A number of lizards have already
pased away.
