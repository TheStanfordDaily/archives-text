# WORLD WAR DIARIES ARE TO BE PRINTED; MANUSCRIPTS NEEDED
## Letters Of Yank Doughboy Students Who Fell In War Desired 
### 
The days of war editing arc called
to mind in a recent request from
Boston from Miss Erdna Reggio, who
writes that she "has undertaken to
assemble and publish in book form
a collection of extracts from the
letters and diaries of American stu
dents who fell in the war, having
been profoundly moved by a similar
production for Germany, by a Doc
tor Witkop.
"Such letters and diaries of under
graduates and postgraduates of all
types," fchc says, "drawn from every
section of our country, should fur
nish a composite portrait of the in
tellectual American youth of the
Great War. The Atlantic Monthly
editors having shown great interest
in such a collection encourages me
to hope for your co-operation and
support."
Any relatives or friends of men
who fell in battle, who are willing
to co-operate in the preparation of
such a memorial, may communicate
with Miss Reggio at 55 Pilgrim Road,
Boston, 17, Massachusetts.
