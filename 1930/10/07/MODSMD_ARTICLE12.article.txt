BEAUVAIS, France, Oct. 0 (Asso
ciated Press). â€”A vast mass of
twisted steel upon a storm-swept
hillside failed to divulge lo investi
gators of the British and French
governments today how the world's
largest dirigible airship, the British
R-101, met disaster here in the early
hours of Sunday with the loss of 48
lives, among them at least two tilled
Englishmen.
Tonight, after officials had pried
and hewed their way into the en
ormous bulk of the stripped and
broken carcass they seemingly were
no nearer to a solution of the great
est air catastrophe of all time, than
when dawn yesterday first brought
them a sight of the still flaming
ruing.
