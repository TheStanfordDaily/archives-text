LLANDUDNO, Wales, Oct. 6. (As
sociated Press) â€”Strong indications
that the autumn session of Parlia
ment will be lively were provided
by the opening day's events of the
Labor Party's annual conference.
For the first time in its history
the political caucus was presided
over by a woman, P.liss Susan Law
rence, member of Parliament and
secretary to the Ministry of Health.
In a keynote .speech she declared
that sooner or later the Labor Party
would have to deal with that "aged
anacronism,' the House of Lords.
This alone, she forecast, would lead
to heated parliamentary exchanges.
