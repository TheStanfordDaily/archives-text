# CLASS OF '33 TIE-UP LEADER TO BE CHOSEN
## Freshmen Meet in Encina Lobby Tonight; Clash To Be Tomorrow 
### 
All sophomore men are requested
to meet in Room 214 at 1 o'clock
this afternoon to make arrangements
for the annual tie-up with the fresh
man class, which will be held on
the stadium field at 3 o'clock to
morrow afternoon, by Tom Cordry,
president of the class of '33.
A plan of battle is to be formed
and a leader chosen, according to
Cordry. Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. presi
dent will make a short speech. The
freshmen are to meet in the Encina
lobby at 7 o'clock tonight to choose
between the four men nominated for
their leader last week.
Replaced Mud Fight
The tie-up was initiated two years
ago to take the place of the mud
fight, which had been abolished
early in 1928. Prior to the abolition
of hazing in 1923 the two clashes
participated in poster fights, tie-ups,
and other types of clashes. These
were all replaced by the mud fight
on the dry bed of Lagunita. The
Executive committee abolished the
mud fight because of the poor
sportsmanship shown and the num
erous violations of the rules.
Members of Skull and Snakes and
the sponsors will supervise the tie
up this year and the regulations set
down in the A.S.S.U. by-laws will
be rigidly enforced, according to
Speegle, who is in charge of the
preparations. Tom Pike and the five
major sport captains are to act as
judges.
