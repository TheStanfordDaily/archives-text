# SOCIALISTIC IDEALISM LURE TO GERMANS DECLARES DR. SIMONS

### Rawson Holmes 
Strong nationalistic sentiment
among the younger element, and the
present world-wide economic de
pression and unemployment, were
cited as the principle causes of the
immense gains made by the National
Socialists in the last German elec
tion, by Dr. Walter C. Simons, for
mer acting president of Germany in
an interview with the Daily yester
day.
"The people are discontented with
present conditions and have been
swayed by the idealistic promises of
the National Socialists led by Hit
ler." Simons declared. "The protes
lations against the Versailles treaty
that have been made by Hitler have
caught the public fancy, but if his
party does manage to form a cabinet
it will soon be shown that the inter
national contracts of Locarno, the
\oung Plan, etc., cannot be broken.
The socialists want a dictatorial
system of government similar to that
of the fascists in Italy, but they are
not to be confused as one and the
ame party, Ge ninny's former chief
justice continued. "Hitler has even
.".one so far as to threaten revolution
as a means of bringing this about.
Any armed revolt would be broken
up by ;i • (•neral strike on the part

|of the workingmen. If any change
is made it would necessarily be
through the Reichstag, and the so
cialists have not the two-thirds ma-
I jority essential to such action."
Dr. Simons described Plitler as a
popular elocutionist but not a great
statesman. "He is very changeable,
shifting with public fancy at the
moment."
In comparing university life in
Germany and Amcrica the noted
statesman declared that athletics
have taken the place of the old-time
i duels as a means of diversion. "A
saber scar is no longer a mark of
I distinction on the face of a German
student as it was in days of the old
student corps," he said laughingly.
"Wednesdays and Saturday ; are
given over to such sports as arc
played in America and British uni
versities; rugby being most popu
lar," concluded Dr. Simons, whose
three sons have graduated from the
University of Leipzig. "Our colleges
are more like yours than those of
England in that the lecture and the
tutor system is not used."
This is Dr. Simons' second trip I<>
the United Stat l; and his first to
the west coast. He is returning to
Germany by way of the Panama
( Canal next week.
