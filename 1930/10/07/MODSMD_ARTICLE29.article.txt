cording to the list of men announced
by Coach Glenn Warner last night.
The squad is scheduled to leave from
Palo Alto station at 4:30.
Men making the trip to the
Middle West are: Ends—Phil Neill,
Bill Doub, Carl Wittenau, Don Col
vin, K. Albertson, Joe Bush. Tackles
—Captain Ray Tandy, Dick Bogue,
"Chuck"' Ehrhorn, George Grey, Bill
Burke, and Henri Laborde. Guards
—Ray Dawson, ''Red" Hand, Bill
Bardin, Ray Hulen, Hunt, and Pete
Heiser. Centers—Perry Taylor, Mar
Albertson, and Bill Marks.
Quarterbacks — Harry Hillman,
"Dusty" Allen, and Phil Winnek.
Halfbacks—Phil Moffatt, Rudie Rin
tala, "Spud" Hardy, Guido Caglieri,
Bill Clark, and Phil Wilson. Full
backs—Harlow Rothert, Bill Sim
kins, and Ernie Caddel.
Besides these players and Coach
Warner, Assistant Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill, Trainer Wallace Denny,
Senior Manager John Mitchell, and
Junior Manager Louis Moore will
travel with the team.
Last Practice
Beneath the broiling sun yester
day, Warner gave the men their last
practice on the home field until Oc
tober 15. With the exception of Cap
tain Ray Tandy, who left yesterday
for Los Angeles to consult a bone
specialist regarding his injured knee,
the 33 men were engaged in running
through plays last night. Tandy will
be back on the campus in time to
leave with the squad, however.
Nothing further regarding his injury
will be known until his return.
According to plans announced
yesterday, the Redshirts will leave
Palo Alto today, arrive in Minne
apolis Friday morning, leave Minne
apolis Saturday night and arrive
here Tuesday morning ready to be
gin preparations for the game with
Oregon State College on October 18.
Bill Bardin, first string guard, last
night took his first work-out with
the squad in over a week, and will
be in shape to play Saturday should
the need arise. However, it is hardly
possible that Bill will start against
the Gophers.
"Dink" Templcton, past master a.
(he art of kicking, spent a few min
utes last night showing George Grey
the finer points of the kick-off.
"Dink" proved that he had lost none
of his skill after the departure of
his pupil by booting a drop kick
squarely between the uprights from
the juncture of the 15-yard line and
the sidelines, a difficult angle for
the best of them.
With the exception of Tandy's in
jury, the Cards came through the
tough tilt with Santa Clara in fine
shape. Perry Taylor, who was con
fined to the Palo Alto Hospital for a
short time, has practically recovered
from his cold. Guido Caglieri,
smashing right halfback of the War
nermen, was working out as usual
with the Varsity last night and
should be in better shape to start
the Minnesota game than he was for
the Santa Clara contest.
Few Injuries
Tandy's injury is not expected to
keep him out of the lineup for more
than a week, sr> Warner may con
gratulate himself that so far there
have been few injuries. Contrasted
with the 1929 season at this time, the
skies are cloudless.
Minnesota, although going down
to defeat at the hands of Vanderbilt
Saturday, presents a bone-crushing
system of offense which will try the
Stanford defense during the course
of the game. Spectators in the Min
nesota stadium will be given a peep
at the 1930 version of the Warner
system, and that should furnish a
topic of conversation during the long
winter evenings.
Because this is one of the first
appearances of "Pop" in the Middle
West since his days at Carlisle, a
large crowd is expected to see the
Warnermen display their wares.
Stanford should win as she pleases.

Three full teams will make the
trip back to Minneapolis today, ac
cording to the list of men announced
by Coach Glenn Warner last night.
The squad is scheduled to leave from
Palo Alto station at 4:30.
Men making the trip to the

Bill Doub, Carl Wittenau, Don Col
vin, K. Albertson, Joe Bush. Tackles

"Chuck"' Ehrhorn, George Grey, Bill
Burke, and Henri Laborde. Guards
—Ray Dawson, ''Red" Hand, Bill
Bardin, Ray Hulen, Hunt, and Pete
Heiser. Centers—Perry Taylor, Mar
Albertson, and Bill Marks.
Quarterbacks — Harry Hillman,
"Dusty" Allen, and Phil Winnek.
Halfbacks—Phil Moffatt, Rudie Rin
tala, "Spud" Hardy, Guido Caglieri,

Thornhill, Trainer Wallace Denny,
Senior Manager John Mitchell, and
Junior Manager Louis Moore will
travel with the team.
Last Practice
Beneath the broiling sun yester
day, Warner gave the men their last
practice on the home field until Oc
tober 15. With the exception of Cap
tain Ray Tandy, who left yesterday
for Los Angeles to consult a bone
specialist regarding his injured knee,
the 33 men were engaged in running
through plays last night. Tandy will
be back on the campus in time to
leave with the squad, however.
Nothing further regarding his injury
will be known until his return.
According to plans announced
yesterday, the Redshirts will leave
Palo Alto today, arrive in Minne
apolis Friday morning, leave Minne
apolis Saturday night and arrive
here Tuesday morning ready to be
gin preparations for the game with
Oregon State College on October 18.
Bill Bardin, first string guard, last
night took his first work-out with
the squad in over a week, and will
be in shape to play Saturday should
the need arise. However, it is hardly
possible that Bill will start against
the Gophers.
"Dink" Templcton, past master a.
(he art of kicking, spent a few min
utes last night showing George Grey
the finer points of the kick-off.
"Dink" proved that he had lost none
of his skill after the departure of
his pupil by booting a drop kick
squarely between the uprights from
the juncture of the 15-yard line and
the sidelines, a difficult angle for
the best of them.
With the exception of Tandy's in
jury, the Cards came through the
tough tilt with Santa Clara in fine
shape. Perry Taylor, who was con
fined to the Palo Alto Hospital for a
short time, has practically recovered
from his cold. Guido Caglieri,
smashing right halfback of the War
nermen, was working out as usual
with the Varsity last night and
should be in better shape to start
the Minnesota game than he was for
the Santa Clara contest.
Few Injuries
Tandy's injury is not expected to
keep him out of the lineup for more
than a week, sr> Warner may con
gratulate himself that so far there
have been few injuries. Contrasted
with the 1929 season at this time, the
skies are cloudless.
Minnesota, although going down
to defeat at the hands of Vanderbilt
Saturday, presents a bone-crushing

nesota stadium will be given a peep
at the 1930 version of the Warner
system, and that should furnish a
topic of conversation during the long
winter evenings.
Because this is one of the first
appearances of "Pop" in the Middle
West since his days at Carlisle, a
large crowd is expected to see the
Warnermen display their wares.
Stanford should win as she pleases.
Three full teams will make the
trip back to Minneapolis today, ac
cording to the list of men announced
by Coach Glenn Warner last night.

Last Practice
Beneath the broiling sun yester
day, Warner gave the men their last
practice on the home field until Oc
tober 15. With the exception of Cap
tain Ray Tandy, who left yesterday
for Los Angeles to consult a bone
specialist regarding his injured knee,
the 33 men were engaged in running
through plays last night. Tandy will
be back on the campus in time to
leave with the squad, however.
Nothing further regarding his injury
will be known until his return.
According to plans announced
yesterday, the Redshirts will leave
Palo Alto today, arrive in Minne
apolis Friday morning, leave Minne
apolis Saturday night and arrive
here Tuesday morning ready to be
gin preparations for the game with
Oregon State College on October 18.
Bill Bardin, first string guard, last
night took his first work-out with
the squad in over a week, and will
be in shape to play Saturday should
the need arise. However, it is hardly
possible that Bill will start against
the Gophers.
"Dink" Templcton, past master a.
(he art of kicking, spent a few min
utes last night showing George Grey
the finer points of the kick-off.
"Dink" proved that he had lost none
of his skill after the departure of
his pupil by booting a drop kick
squarely between the uprights from
the juncture of the 15-yard line and
the sidelines, a difficult angle for
the best of them.
With the exception of Tandy's in
jury, the Cards came through the
tough tilt with Santa Clara in fine
shape. Perry Taylor, who was con
fined to the Palo Alto Hospital for a
short time, has practically recovered
from his cold. Guido Caglieri,
smashing right halfback of the War
nermen, was working out as usual
with the Varsity last night and
should be in better shape to start
the Minnesota game than he was for
the Santa Clara contest.
Few Injuries
Tandy's injury is not expected to
keep him out of the lineup for more
than a week, sr> Warner may con
gratulate himself that so far there
have been few injuries. Contrasted
with the 1929 season at this time, the
skies are cloudless.
Minnesota, although going down
to defeat at the hands of Vanderbilt
Saturday, presents a bone-crushing
system of offense which will try the
Stanford defense during the course
of the game. Spectators in the Min
nesota stadium will be given a peep
at the 1930 version of the Warner
system, and that should furnish a
topic of conversation during the long
winter evenings.
Because this is one of the first
appearances of "Pop" in the Middle
West since his days at Carlisle, a
large crowd is expected to see the
Warnermen display their wares.
Stanford should win as she pleases.
