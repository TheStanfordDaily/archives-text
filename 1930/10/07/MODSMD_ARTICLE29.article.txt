Last Practice
Beneath the broiling sun yester
day, Warner gave the men their last
practice on the home field until Oc
tober 15. With the exception of Cap
tain Ray Tandy, who left yesterday
for Los Angeles to consult a bone
specialist regarding his injured knee,
the 33 men were engaged in running
through plays last night. Tandy will
be back on the campus in time to
leave with the squad, however.
Nothing further regarding his injury
will be known until his return.
According to plans announced
yesterday, the Redshirts will leave
Palo Alto today, arrive in Minne
apolis Friday morning, leave Minne
apolis Saturday night and arrive
here Tuesday morning ready to be
gin preparations for the game with
Oregon State College on October 18.
Bill Bardin, first string guard, last
night took his first work-out with
the squad in over a week, and will
be in shape to play Saturday should
the need arise. However, it is hardly
possible that Bill will start against
the Gophers.
