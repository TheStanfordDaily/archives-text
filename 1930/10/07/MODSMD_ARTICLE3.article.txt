A special meeting of Conference was held yesterday to go over the
rules and machinery. It was emphasized that a 2:30 o'clock midweek
leave must be signed for before 10:30 o'clock and that on the row, mid
week 11:30 leaves may be taken after 10;30 o'clock if a key has already
been obtained from the housemother before 10:30.
Any number of 2:30 o'clock midweek leaves may be taken with the
permission of the house or A.W.S. president who must consult with health

•'and scholarship chairman before
granting leave. Women on "pro" or

The most important change in
signout machinery is recording time
of return. This is to be done so that
a complete check may be kept on
the number and amount of 2:30
o'clock leaves used. Since the 2:30
o'clock leave is given for transporta
tion purposes only, destination must
be approximately an hour's drive.
San Jose is included in the late 2:30
o'clock leave.
Lockout Committee
Since the regulations have not yet
been in use, the machinery is not
complete, and it will be necessary
to have standing committees
throughout the year to cheek and
revise the rules. There will be a
committee from the Administration
consisting of two housemothers, two
students, Dean Mary Yost, and Miss
' Anastasia Doyle. There will also be
an A.W.S. committee which is to be
appointed by A.W.S. president and
will probably consist of lockout
chairmen, old lockout committee
women, and general women repre
sentatives.
Careful statistics of all lockouts,
late leaves, etc., are to be kept at
the request of the administration
for the year is considered a trial
only, and any apparent flaws will be
immediately checked up on.
New lockout regulations were presented for the first time to all women
lust night in house meetings and are to be further discussed and explained
at the women's assembly in the clubhouse Wednesday at 7:15 o'clock.
