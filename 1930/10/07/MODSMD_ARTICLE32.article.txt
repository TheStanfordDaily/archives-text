# THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM
## 
### 
That there is no cause for worry about the two oases of infantile
paralysis now under observation in the local hospital, is the word
of Dr. Thomas A. Storey. I niversity health otYicer and men's medi
cal adviser. Together with the State Hoard ol Health, the local
health unit has taken prompt action in treatment of the cases and
no alarm is felt for the remainder of the community.
All students who feel any illness, however slight, are urged to
report to either Dr. Storey or Dr. Hertha Dyment. medical adviser
for women, for examination. Strict adherence to the requests of
the two medical authorities will aid in prevention and possible
further spread of the disease.
