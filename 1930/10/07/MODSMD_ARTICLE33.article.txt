The unbelievable is here: Revised lockout rules for the Five
I lundred were read and explained last night at all house meetings—
to go into effect Thursday of this week after a general women's
assembly Wednesday night.
The greater social freedom for which Stanford women have
been agitating annually for several years, has been granted In the
administration for a trial period of one year, I'egirining Thursday
an increased number of mid-week leaves will be granted, and week
end 2:30 o'clock leaves will be permitted. The proverbial strong
men are falling down weeping that such should be the case after
these long years of 10:30 o'clock and 1 : 30 o'clock adjournments.
Strong Women, on the other hand, are still pinching themselves
skeptically.
Hut it is true! And Thursday begins the hew regime—compli
cated and tardy but a blessing nevertheless. Congratulations, as the
old saying goes, are in order all around. To the long line of women
who have agitated for greater liberty in the past, to those who so
valiantly sponsored the campaign of last spring, to the committee
who worked out the machinery for approval of the administration—
to all these belong the hearty thanks of every member of the Five
Hundred and all others interested.
Hut —as always with freedom come duties. I poti the Five Hun
dred of this year falls the responsibility of determining whether or
not future generations will again don the old ball and chain. The
administration is justified in stipulating that this is only a trial
period. All that remains is for the women to offer conscientious
ro operation in the matter of statistical records, and to make fair
and honest use of their newly acquired wings.
