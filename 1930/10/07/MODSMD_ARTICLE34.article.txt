# TURN OUT FOR THE RALLY
## 
### 
I hirty-three C ardinal gridsters entrain for Minneapolis this
nllcrnoon. Their purpose is to engage in a fjame with the I 'niversitv
of Minnesota eleven Saturday: tluir intention, to acquaint the
' lophcrs as thoroughly with the Warner brand of football as were
the West I'pint Cadets in 1 ( '28 and I ( >2 ( >.
Stanford's visit to the Middle West this week will be the Cards'
only long trip this year. hollowing their return from Minnesota,
the W arnermen will not leave the campus except for ihe 1'.C.1..A.
vame in Los Angeles and the I'ig Came at I'erkelev.
I'or this reason, today's rally will be the only real send-off which
will be given a Stanford football team this year. Whv not make it
a good one? A good send-off rally is a genuine encouragement to
the team, but a poor one is worse than none at all.
