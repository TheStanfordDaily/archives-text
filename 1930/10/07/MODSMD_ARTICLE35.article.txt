# SPARE THAT FROSH!

Repetition of last year's "tic-tip" fiasco may mean the end of
-ophomore freshman class struggles which long have played nil im
portant role in Stanford life.
Tomorrow the men of '33 and '34 will meet in their traditional
battle. It is imperative that the judges and committee in charge as
sure each team a fair deal.
This will he the third appearance of under-classmen in the knot
lying act. which has replaced the mud-light since 1 "27. ()hl timers
were shocked when it was learned that the mud fight, dear to the
heart of every Stanford man. was doomed. \nd hitter were the
curses when it was announced that a "tea party tie-up" would he the
substitute.
And so far Stanford studelits have never had a chance to prop
erly see and judge the "tie-up." The past two contests have been
run in a haphazardly manner, and now a large number of students
have arrived at the untimely conclusion that "tie-up" is a failure.
Perhaps this is correct, but let's see the contest properlv run be
fore we judge. A "tie-up" is far from being a pink tea affair; and
if given a chance, may well be a worth\ successor to the mud light.
