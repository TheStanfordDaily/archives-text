MONTE CARLO—At the Now Stan
lord.
Some shows are funny by design,
' some are unwittingly so, but Monte
Carlo is both. This show is, to say
the least, different. Or perhaps be
cause it is a hodge-podge of every
other show it appears to be dif
ferent. There are bits of opera, bits
of musical comedy, bits of low slao
stick stufT, and bits of real acting.
The plot is negligible but that
doesn't matter when there are such
moments as Jeannette McDonald,
the heroine, leaning out of the train
window singing the theme song
only to be answered by hundreds
of peasants scattered over the land
scape. Another high spot of the pic
ture is the scene where Jeannette,
the countess, is turned down by
her hairdresser, and bursts into
tears. It is a rare show indeed,
when the leading lady cries convinc
ingly enough to be ugly.
Besides Jeanette McDonald an ex
cellent cast helps to put Monte
Carlo over. There is Zasu Pitts as
the maid, the silly duke, and Jack
, Buchanan, the hairdresser, alias
Count Rudolph. —N. J.
QUEER PEOPLE. By Carroll and
Garrett Graham. New York,
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Hollywood's magnificent many
ringed circus is so delightfully—
| and. lor the most part, truely, de-
I scribed in "Queer People'' that any
reader must laugh at the gorgeous
j comedy of it all.
The two opening paragraphs give
I an indication of what is to eome:
"And so the film star called the
j bootlegger.
''It was the only logical thing for
Gilbert Vance to do. All in one day.
1 his wife h;;d left him, Colossal Pic
| tures had renewed his contract, his
mistress had returned unexpectedly
! from location, his lawyer had in
j formed him that a charge of driv
ing while intoxicated had been
! 'fixed.' and his tests—both film and
I Wassermann—had turned out fa
vorably."
The authors—Carroll and Garrett
, Graham, scenario writers, have pro
duced a tremendously amusing bur
! lesque of the true Hollywood, and
I they didn'j, have to exaggerate most
of the incidents taken from real
I life.
Characters, for the most part, can
( easily be distinguished, despite the

writers' assertion to the contrary,
as those clowns actually featured in
almost any Hollywood scene.

LITTLE ORCIIII) ANNIE—At the
Geary Theatre, San Francisco.
If there ever has been a pretty
model in a New York fashion salon,
who accepted anything from carna
tions to Rolls-Royce automobiles
110 m three different men at the
same time, and still remained pure,
sweet, simple, and unsuspecting,
this is her story. Aside from the im
probability of such a person, the
tale is plausible.
Betty Bronson innocently coos
her way through three acts of com
edy that is only passing fair, in an
inimitably modest though self-as
sured manner that makes you like
her—and wish that you might take
little Orchid Annie in hand and tell
her a few things.
Stories about poor little working
girls traditionally moralize. This
one inanely shows that if only you
are good enough and sufficiently
oblivious to what goes on around
you, not even the most wolfish of
butter-and-egg gentleman-wolves
can harm you. An amusing hypo
thesis.
Mabel Forrest, as the noisy model
who appreciates knowing all that
Annie doesn't, saves the show from
monotony. She remains more per
fectly and convincingly in her role
than does any other member of the
cast, perhaps because the part itself
is most genuine. Miss Bronson is
very appealing, but is a trifle slow
in warming to her part and per
suading her audience into sympathy.
Julia Blanc, who plays the kind but
calculating business woman, is per
fect for her part. The lesser women's
parts are rather weak in them
selves, but well played; the men's
roles, disappointingly uncertain
throughout.
The authors may be compliment
ed for introducing some remarkably
good "wise-cracks," and the staging
is unusually well-timed. We still
aren't certain about the jazz num
ber performed by the young darkey
maid in the apartment,* rather pre
ferring our "Wah-Wah Girl from
Agua Calicnte" on a phonograph
record. And, no matter what else
she does, Betty Bronson will eter
nally be Peter Pan. "Little Orchid
Annie" merits a good laugh but
little remembering.
