# CABBAGES and THINGS

Last week we all froze to death,
ordered extra woolen blankets. ;ind
had our fur eoats taken out of
storage. And now, the Students who
have sweltered in the East all sum
mer are the only ones who can stand
the sunshine. Believe it or not, this
weather is unusual, for California.
And in a few weeks more, the
newly be-eorded juniors will pass
for just any kind of upper-division
students. Ink and rolling in gra
velled driveways are suggested as
aids to quick transformation of
trousers that are unfashionably
clean.
To bad the girls don't have a
corresponding system of labeling
classes. Maybe variety is just
as well; and girls never seem to
get much noticeable class-spirit,
anyway.
Among the catalogued classes in
the English department, we had to
choose Directed Reading—the only
course offered in which sections are
distinctly labelled for male and fe
male students, separately. What's
the percentage? If they're going to
be so particular and selective, what
excuse will they make for the
women authors who have written
under masculine noms-de-plume?
Mavbe they've decided to teach each
half how the other half lives. Thi.s,
the scientific method, which most
strongly approves the objective trial
and error method. Oh, well ....
An ancient literary master
piece has just reappeared from
row here:
From Switzerland my Neighbor
came,
She was a pretty Miss.
The chiggcrs have been biting
her;
Now she's a dotted Swiss.
If you r.rn't sufficiently vulgar to
krov/ what, a chigger is—it's an ani
mal whose portrait you draw in your
first quarter of Biology (if you last
that long). Here again, the scientific
method would be enlightening; but
there's a limit to all things.
