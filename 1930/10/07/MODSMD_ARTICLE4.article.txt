WASHINGTON, Oct. S. (Associ
ated Press)—ln an effort to avert
future aircraft disasters abroad,
Chairman Britten of the House Na
val Affairs Committee, announced
today he would sponsor legislation
at the next Congress to permit ex
portation of helium for use in drigi
bles of foreign governments.
Voicing the opinion that the disas
ter to the British dirigible R-101
would not have occurred had the
non-inflammable helium been used
instead of hydrogen gas, Britten
said he favored either permitting
foreign governments to establish
plants in the United States or in
creasing the facilities of this coun
try so the product could be sold
abroad at cost.
The United States is the only
country in the world possessing
helium in unlimited quantities but
present law prohibits its exporta
tion.
Britten made his announcement
after Rear Admiral William A. Mof
fett, chief of the Navy Bureau of
Aeronautics, had urged repeal of
the present law to permit helium
to be sold in peace time to all na
tions, especially to Great Britain
and Germany. He added the extent
of the R-101 disaster "is undoubt
edly due" to its having been in
flated with hydrogen gas.
