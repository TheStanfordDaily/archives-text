# LOOKING AROUND

At Washington State College, frosh
caught wearing cords are forced to
run around in their unmentionables.
At U.C.L.A. frosh who dare to wear
the upper-classman's garb, are given
involuntary baths at the nearest i
fraternity house without the form
ality of undressing the daring fresh
man.
If a Stanford first year man
had the audacity to wear cords,
we would all probably be so
Mustered that the onl> thing we
could do would be to rush up
to him and say, "Hello."
Professor Knopf of the U.S.C.
School of Religion stales that he is
in favor of co-cducation because a !
large group of men herded in a
small town without normal oppor- ,
tunities creates a tension that breaks
forth in considerable folly.
Five-sixths of Stanford men
do not have co-education so we i
presume that is why five-sixths
of Stanford men act so foolish in
San Francisco.
Freshmen women at Stanford are
left off quite easy when we read that
frosh women at U.S.C. are not al- j
lowed to wear hats while at Mills !
College, they do not use cosmetics:
The best way to find out all about
yourself is to read what other peo
ple are saying about you. Hoover #
awakes daily from the presidential
couch to find he has caused panics
on Wall St., thrown thousands of
men out of work, and created gen
eral ruin. Clara Bow read one
morning that she was the"It Girl."
According to the Daily Trojan.
"Stanford is now bent 011 cover
ing herself with glory in tiie
dying moments of her athletic
career. Ray Lyman Wilbur
doesn't like athletics and he will
see to it that Stanford men of
the future don't like athletics."
This is quite a shock. We didn'l
know we were trying to wrap our
selves in a silvery sheen of glory;
we hadn't felt the pangs of "dying
moments"; and although we knew
President Wilbur favored Junior
Colleges, we just learned he had an
aversion to athletics.
