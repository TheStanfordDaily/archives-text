WASHINGTON, Oct. G. (/P)â€”The
Supreme Court opened a new term
today with the issues before it
overshadowed by the pressing prob
lem of congestion in the lower fed
eral courts.
On the eve of convening, Chief
Justice Hughes made public recom
mendations of the senior circuit
judges that five new district judges
be appointed to help stem the
mounting tide of criminal and civil
cases with which the courts are
finding it impossible to keep abreast.
