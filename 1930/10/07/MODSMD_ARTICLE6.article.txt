# CLOTHES RIPPED OFF WHEN SOPHS, YEARLINGS CLASH
## 
### 
Big news for clothiers and
ragpickers! An amazing battle
royal between the two under
classes last night in front of
Encina Hall in ten minutes
turned into a tilt between sev
eral hundred naked, struggling,
tomato-and-egg smeared "stu
dents." Business around En
cina will be picking up today,
as not a man but left his pants
in pieces on the front lawn. ,
This story is for the women
—they really couldn't be there
—but all the men on the cam
pus were present. No use say
ing who won. Sophorfcores,
crawling with freshmen, were
constantly dragged into the
hall, their clothes ripped off.
The first-year men were treat
ed the same on the ooposite
side of the lawn, and "taken
for a ride" to walk home from
far out in the sticks, nude as
Adam before he found a leaf.
One freshman, name un
known, received a broken arm
from the struggle.
