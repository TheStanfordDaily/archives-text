# MEN'S GLEE CLUB MAKES FIRST FLANS FOR '30-31 CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
With an unusuany large group of
experienced singers on the club
rolls, the Stanford Glee Club
launched plans for an ambitious
program of entertainments for the
1930-31 season at its first meeting
of the year, held last night.
The first engagement on the cal
endar for the club is a dinner dance
concert to be given at the Mark
Hopkins hotel in San Francisco, Oc
tober 14. No other engagements
have been definitely made, accord
ing to William Dienstein, club man
ager, but the club has a number of
tentative offers.
A total of 52 old members have
returned to the University this
quarter, making the usual fall try
outs unnecessary, since only a few
new men can be accommodated.
Men with high tenor voices or very
deep bassos can be used, howevÂ«,
and. anyone with such qualifications
who is interested should try out at
any club meeting during the next
two weeks, Dienstein said. Meet
ings are held on Monday, Wednes
day, and Friday evenings in the
basement of the Engineering build
ing. Men who have some ability jn
the line of vaudeville specialty
stunts are also wanted by the club.
Among the items which the sing
ers intend to add to their repertoire
this year, are some farcical grand
opera skits, including a take-off on
a bridge game and one entitled, "I
Think I Smell Smoke." The latter
borrows its music from a wide vari
ety of well-known grand operas.
Officers of the Glee club this year
are as follows: President, Everett
Baker, vice-president, John Huneke;
secretary, Mervyn Shippey.
