# Athletics Defeat Cardinals 2-0 To Take First Place
## JIMMIE FOXX HITS FOUR-BASE CLOUT IN NINTH TO WIN Karnshaw, Grimes Stage One of Best Mound Duels in History 
### 
SPORTSMEN'S PARK, St. Louis,
Oct. (5. </P) â€”A terrific homerun
drive by Jimmy Foxjf, high into the
left field bleacheds in the ninth in
ning with Cochrane on base, broke
up a sensational pitching duel today,
gave the Athletics a 2-to-0 victory
over the Cardinals and put the
Mackmen back into the lead lor the
world's baseball championship. The
: cries now stands three games to
two in their favor.
The Cardinals relied on Burleigh
Grimes, moist-ball hurler, to stage
; comeback today and defeat the
Athletics. Big George Earnshaw,
light-handed pitching ace of the
..lack forces, winner over the Red
Birds in the second game, took the
mound for the Athletics.
Earnshaw yielded only two hits
in the seven innings he pitched
when he left the'game in the eighth
when Moore went in to pinch hit.
Lefty Grove took over the mound
duties for the last two cantos and
gave one hit.
Not a single Cardinal reached
third base, during the game and
only two, Gelbert and Wilson,
reached the keystone sack. Until
the eighth frame no Athletic had
traveled as far around as third but
the Mackmen succeeded in stacking
the bags in their half of the inning.
Haas reached first on a bunt, stole
second, and took third on Boley's
single. Moore walked to fill the
hags with one away, but Bishop
hit into the infield for one more
put-out and Dykes grounded to Gel
bert for the third.
Cochrane walked to start the
ninth inning and alter Simmons
Hied out to Gelbert, Foxx poled out
I lis long homer.
There is no game today as the
teams will be traveling back to
Philadelphia for the last two con
tests. Who the managers will pitch
is uncertain, but it looks like Wal
berg for the A's and Haliahan for
the Cards.
