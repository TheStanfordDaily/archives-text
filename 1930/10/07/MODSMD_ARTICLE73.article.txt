# THE
						KING OF BACKSTOPS
## McGraw Chooses Cochrane Next Best to Buck Ewing; A's Backstop Has Made Excellent Record 
### Feg Murray, '16 
As (he 1930 major league baseball
spason nears its end, give a thought
to Gordon S. Cochrane, catcher ol
the world's champion Philadelphia
Athletics, and easily the greatest
catcher in baseball today. Some like
their Roger Bresnahan, who caught
the Peerless Matty and invented the
catchers' shin guards, others will
vote for Johnny or Jimmy Archer,
Kling's successor with the Chicago
Cubs, while still others will claim
that Lou Criger, of the .22 calibre
arm, or Ray Schalk, the "Mighty
Atom," was the greatest catcher
since Buck Ewing, but as for me,
give me Mickey Cochrane of the
1929 Athletics! John McGraw
chooses Buck Ewing, his star of 30-
odd years ago, as the best backstop
of all time, and John ought to know,
but he was loud in his praise of
Mickey Cochrane during the last
world series.

Just think what the former Bos
ton University football player did in
that thrilling five-game series with
the powerful National League cham
pions, first remember that Cochrane
had just finished a strenuous season
in which his fine catching, batting
an all-around hustling had done a
great deal to put his. team in that
same championship. Mickey had
batted .331 in 135 games during the
1929 season, but his first and only
world series was the crowning
achievement of his career, for in the
five contests he made six timely
hits, scored five runs, and batted for
an average of an even .400, second
only to Dykes among the Athletics!
In the whole series, Cochrane
fielded 1000, making 59 put-outs and
2 assists. So far in this series he has
hit two homers. And, say, do you
think Grove and Walberg's stuff is
easy to handle?
