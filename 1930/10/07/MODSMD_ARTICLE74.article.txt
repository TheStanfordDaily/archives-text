# MALONEY WORKS ON TEAM PLAY IN FIRST SOCCER PRACTICES
## 
### 
Teamwork is the word with the
varsity soccer squad this week as
Coach Harry Maloney gets his men
down to real work in scrimmage in
preparation for their first game Sat
urday.
Maloney had his first and second
string teams mixed up yesterday
afternoon and gave them a work
out under game conditions. The
prospective regulars were split up
between the two elevens, but the
one led by Captain Eberhart had a
distinct advantage and kept the
ball in scoring territory for a large
part of the scrimmage. Mujica, at
inside left, and Washburn at cen
ter forward, stood out along with
Eberhart who displayed his usual
hard driving.
Mujica is a veteran of two years
on the varsity, while Washburn was
something of a sensation as the
captain of last year's freshman
team.
More than four full teams are
now included in the varsity squad,
and Coach Maloney expressed him
self after practice yesterday as
being well pleased with the way the
men are showing up so early in the
season. A game has been scheduled
to be played here Saturday after
noon, but since the schedule has
not yet been definitely approved,
Maloney refused to give out the
name of the opposing team. The en
tire soccer schedule will be an
nounced today.
