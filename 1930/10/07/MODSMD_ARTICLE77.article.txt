# CHANGES MADE IN UNION DINING HALL RATES AND HOURS
## 
### 
With the change in management
of the Cellar and Union Dining halls,
under the direction of Miss Chris
tine Ricker, several alterations have
resulted in opening and closing
hours and in food prices.
For the convenience of persons
using the Main Union dining hall
on Sundays the hall will be opened
at 12:15 instead of at the old time
of 12:45. The cafeteria is open from
7:30 to 8:30 o'clock in the mornings;
from 11:45 to 1:00 o'clock in the
afternoons, and from 5:45 until G:45
o'clock in the evenings. Luncheon is
served in the main dining hall from
11:45 to 1:00 o'clock; dinner from
6:00 to 7:00 o'clock.
Besides the regular fifty-cent
luncheon and the special Chef's
luncheon for forty-five cents, a new
sixty-five cent dinner with both
soup and dessert has been added to
the list of special service at the
Union.
