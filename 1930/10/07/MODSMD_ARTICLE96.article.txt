# BRADSHAW LOOKS TO BANNER YEAR FOR BABE ELEVEN
## Yearlings Display Power Against Broncs; UCLA Babes' Next Foe 
### 
With the showing of his yearling
eleven against the Santa Clara
freshmen last Saturday, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw can well be opti
mistic toward a banner year for the
Card babes.
, In turning back the Bronco inva
sion, the Redshirts displayed a
brand of football that speaks well
for future Card varsities. The
Santa Clara outfit entered the con
j test favored to down the Cards,
having the week before defeated
the highly.touted Menlo J.C. eleven.
The result of Saturday's game was
no fluke, the Santa Clarans living
I up to their reputation of a smooth
running, hard-fighting team. But
the crumbling of the fighting Bronco
forward wall to the battering of
Coach Bradshaw's underrated year
lings seems to point toward a sue
! cessful babe season.
With no game scheduled for next
week, Bradshaw expects to have his
team in mid-season form a few
days before they journey South to
tackle the U.C.L.A. babes the fol
-1 lowing Saturday.
