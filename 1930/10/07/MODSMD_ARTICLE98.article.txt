## ODDS 'N ENDS 
### 
Sometime in August we sat down
0 a typewriter and dashed off a
/arn about Harlow Rothert and his
iossibilities for All-American this
•eason, but the showing of Bill
aimkins in the first two games of
lie year made il appear as though
1 lis story would never run in the
Jaily. Howthesoever, Romping Har
ow cannot be kept on ihe bench, 1
tnd so there is still hope for the
irticie.
Stanford's offense Saturday was
,adly lacking in spark plugs until a
amiliar 32 entered the game, but
rom that moment cnward, the Card
jackfleld began to fire in unison
md the half-time gun saved the
ironcos from a touchdown. Harlow
vothert's kicking was a known
lualit.y before this year, but to this
\e has added an unmistakable drive
u hitting the line, the ability to
burn chalk marks beneath his
•leats once open spaces appear, a
ureness in pass receiving, a pass
ng threat improving with every
, f ame, and a heads-up pass defense
uaking the aerial game of oppon
•nts a two-edged sword which they
<re apt to find at their own throats.
Conspicuous almost to the point
if impossibility Saturday was the
ilay of Phil Neill. Any doubts
.vhich observers may have enter- !
ained regarding his pass-catching
ibility were completely quelled by
lis circus stabs during the Santa
"'lara games. Dwarfed by the crc
•uracy of Cfiptain "Mush" Muller
n (his feature of the game during
he l'J29 season, Phil's leats will
ival those of that sterling leader
iefore the faculty issues his sheep
kin.
Branded as "smooth." perfect, '
ind the like, few adjectives remain
o characterize Neill's end play. Let
t suffice to say that he is indeed
he lair-haired chap in Stanford's
ine of seven stalwarts. If there are
my "Success Boys of Stanford,
•ount number 41 as an outstanding
xample.
Those paens (yes, we saw it too)
A praise sung a year ago whenever
he name of Moft'att was mentioned
nakes the lot of the poor sports
c-ribe doubly hard. Nothing remains
!o be said. According to our figures,
Phil carried the ball 18 times Sat
urday to average 2.9 yards per i
•airy, which means first downs in
iny language.
Stanford's love for California j
found expression in Ihe multitudin- ,
his tears, which were shed when
announcements regarding the Ca'i-
Cougar clash filled the air Satur
day. Should Washington State de
le at the Trojans, an unlikely event,
it would put the Redshirts on the
spot, for the men of Hollingberry
would then be in an ideal position
to take the balance of their games
:,nd walk off with at least a mathe
matical tie for Conference honors.
Oregon, whose Conference sched
ule consists of Washington, Idaho,
U.C.L.A., and Oregon State, is an
other rival to be considered in the
percentage column. It is not asking
too much of Spears to win all four
if these games —and if the so-called
Rig Three of California cut each
jther's throats for the third year
hi succession, ihe gonfalon will go
North.
Stanford's band, conspicuous by
its absence Saturday, will make its
initial apperaance at the Oregon
State game, according to word re
eivnd from our undercover agents.
Somehow a game seems flat without
t band producing lingering sweet
ness long drawn out during the lulls
in activity.
Not even a freshman game will
iold forth in the Stadium October
11, so it is expected that numerous
ons of the Cardinal will wend their
way into the Memorial Stadium at |

Berkeley to watch the Bears battle
Saint Mary's. Cries of "Why doesn't
Stanford play those guys" will be
heard on every hand, but if the
Redshirt visitors will only remem
ber that: (a) A Stanford man is al
ways a gentleman; (b) Such a game
would be entirely too rough (joke);
and (c) In refusing to schedule
Saint Mary's, Stanford proves ihat
mere monetary gain is not the aim
of the University—all will not be
lost.
The Warnermen have yet to play
a Conference game, and will not
open active hostilities along those
lines until October 18, when Oregon
State appears here. Four Confer
ence games in a row confront Stan
ford in Oregon State, Southern
California. U.C.L.A., and Washing
ton, so il appears Stanford has not
yet begun to fight. —L. K.. Jr.
