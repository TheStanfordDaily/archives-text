# RED CAMPAIGNS IN GOVERNMENT CAMPS USELESS
## Col. Dengler Gives Views On Communist Drive To Committee REVEAL PROPAGANDA 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7. (Asso-j
dated Press) Although Communist \
organizers worked from within the
eitizens military training camps in
California this past summer, their
seeds of propaganda fell largely
upon barren ground, the Congres
sional Communist - investigating
committee was told here today.
Colonel Frederick L. Dengler,
U.S.A., the first witness today, gave
the committtee photostatic copies of
eight circulars* and one newspaper
clipping as proof Communist or
ganizers had been active among sol
diers and student officers, and then
testified the propaganda had been
"wholly ineffective in military cir- x
cles."
Three of the circulars were dis
tributed by mail to "trainees" at
citizens' military training camps and
one at a National Guard encamp
ment, Colonel Dangler said, appar
ently with the aid of someone "with
in the camps or familiar with the
camps."

The circulars about which Col
onel Dengler testified were distri
buted at the San Francisco Armory
and (residio, Monterey, San Luis
Obispo, and San Pedro. No organ
ized effort had been made to make
speeches to soldiers, he said, in
answer to a question.
John T. McFadden, assistant
Scout executive here, said his Boy
Scouts had been given Communist
circulars when they gathered at a
railroad depot to welcome some of
their comrades home from England.
He had no copies of the circular,
explaining the disgusted youths had
destroyed them all.
Just before adjournment the com
mittee recalled William Simons,
Communist organizer, and asked
him whether, in a speech last spring
in Oakland he had told a meeting
of unemployed, "Don't be alarmed
at this unemployment situation" be
cause it was the result of the plan
of the soviet to develop discontent
in the United States, "simply fer
tilizing the fields to sow seeds of
Communism."

Circulars Distributed
The circulars about which Col
onel Dengler testified were distri
buted at the San Francisco Armory
and (residio, Monterey, San Luis
Obispo, and San Pedro. No organ
ized effort had been made to make
speeches to soldiers, he said, in
answer to a question.
John T. McFadden, assistant
Scout executive here, said his Boy
Scouts had been given Communist
circulars when they gathered at a
railroad depot to welcome some of
their comrades home from England.
He had no copies of the circular,
explaining the disgusted youths had
destroyed them all.
Just before adjournment the com
mittee recalled William Simons,
Communist organizer, and asked
him whether, in a speech last spring
in Oakland he had told a meeting
of unemployed, "Don't be alarmed
at this unemployment situation" be
cause it was the result of the plan
of the soviet to develop discontent
in the United States, "simply fer
tilizing the fields to sow seeds of
Communism."
