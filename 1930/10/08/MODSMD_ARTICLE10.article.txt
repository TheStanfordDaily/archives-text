### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 7. (TP)â€”Elmer W.
Arch, an attorney, has sued Univer
sal Air Lines for $50,000 damages,
charging that a forced landing was
a breach of contract.
The plane, in which Arch was
being flown from Louisville, Ky., to
Chicago, was forced down at Spring
lield, 111., because of the poor con
dition of the plane rather than be
cause of weather conditions. The
same plane two days later crashed
into a gas tank and three persons
were killed.
Arch maintains that the forced
landing caused him to miss an im
portant business engagement.
