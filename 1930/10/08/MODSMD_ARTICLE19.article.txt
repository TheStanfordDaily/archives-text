# SOPHS JANGLE WITH FROSH IN ANNUAL CLASH
## "Dod Butte Elected Babe Captain; Sophs To Be Led By "Ted" Kite 
### 
Freshmen and sophomores will be
given an opportunity to renew ac
quaintances made at the "rush" on
Encina Monday night, in the annual
"tie-up" which is to be held on the
Stadium field at 3 o'clock this af
ternoon.
Walter "Ted" Kite, varsity guard
and a star on last year's freshman
squad, was chosen by the class of
'33 yesterday as their leader in the
clash, while Joseph "Dud ' Butte
was elected freshman captain at a
gathering in Encina last night.
The struggle is to be policed by
the sponsors, the Rally Committee,
and members of Skull and Snakes,
who will rigidly enforce the rules
of the contest, according to Paul
Speegle, chairman of the A.S.S.U.
committee in charge of preparations.
Freshmen will be marked with
green paint, while the sophomores
will be distinguishable by the ab
sence of any markings.
Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president, and
the five varsity major sport cap
tains will judge the outcome of the
contest, which will be handled ac
cording to rules set down in the
A.S.S.U. bylaws. The text of these
follows in part:
New Rules
No one except contestants and of
ficials shall be allowed on the lield.
Duration of the rush shall be fifteen
minutes. There shall be no prelim
inary and no aftermath engagement.
Shoes worn by contestants shall be
soft-soled and without hard cleats.
Soft cotton rope in three-foot
lengths only shall be used in bind
ing contestants. Each class shall
start from a line midway between
the center of the field and the goal
posts.
A contestant, to be eliminated
from the rush, must be bound hands
and feet, and placed in an enclosure
under the goal-posts at the end of
the field from which he started. He
shall there be appropriately marked
with paint, such marking indicating
elimination from the rush, which
he shall not thereafter re-enter.
No Rough Play
There shall not be any slugging,
unnecessarily rolgn tactics, or other
unsportsmanlike conduct. t
The class having the larger num
ber of unmarked men on the field
at the finish shall be declared the
winner.
"The decision will be made on a
fair and just basis, and will not
favor the sophomores whether they
win or not as has been done in the
past," Pike stated yesterday.
Contestants are urged to report
at the Stadium at 2:30 o'clock by
Speegle, as the opening shot will
be fired promptly at 3 o'clock. The
"tie-up" chairman also urges as
many sophomores to turn out as
possible. "The freshmen arc wait
ing for them, and they have fire in
their eyes," he stated.
