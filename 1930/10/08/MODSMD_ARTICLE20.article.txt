PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 7. (Asso
ciated Press) —Announcement was
made today by the University of
Pennsylvania's School of Medicine
that a new method, through a "win
dow" in a rabbit's ear, has been
developed whereby scientists lor the
first time may study over a long
period a microscopic detail of the
growth of living tissue in a warm
blooded animal.
Through its use, the announce
ment said, the cellular changes in
living tissues can be studied as by
no other method, and fundamental
information regarding the manner
in which abnormal cellular reactions
occur in infectious diseases such as
tuberculosis, tumor growth, and
cancer, will be obtainable.
