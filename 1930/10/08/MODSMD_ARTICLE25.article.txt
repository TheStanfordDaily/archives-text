HAVANA, Oct. 7. (Associated
Press) â€”Some doubt as to the prac
ticability of the experiments of Pro
fessor Georges Claude, French scien
tist, who yesterday gave a demon
stration of his ability to make vari
ations of Gulf Stream temperatures
produce electrical energy, was ex
pressed today by Dr. Luciano de
Goicochea, dean of the department
of electrical engineering of the Uni
versity of Havana.
Professor Claude yesterday made
forty 500 candlepower bulbs glow
for a half hour with energy pro
duced from sea water temperature
variations. It was his first demon
stration before other men of Science,
and the Frenchman was hailed as
the pioneer of a great new move
ment which might result in the
revolutionizing of a great new
movement which might result in the
revolutionizing of industrial power
methods.
