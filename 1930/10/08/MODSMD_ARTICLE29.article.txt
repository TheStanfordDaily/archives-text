# POP AND SQUAD OF 33 ENTRAIN FOR MINNESOTA
## Lambert Taken To Gopher Game in Place of Guido Caglieri TANDY WILL NOT PLAY 
### Len Kullmann 
Except for such exercises as the
men can pick up during short train
stops, Stanford's Varsity football
squad will be without a workout
following their departure last night
from Palo Alto until their arrival
in Minneapolis Friday.
Thirty-three strong, the team
pulled out from the station last night
with the encouraging shouts of the
student body ringing in their ears.
With the exception of the last min
ute substitution of Tom Lambert for
Guido Caglieri, the squad was the
same as was announced by Warner.
Tandy Out
Captain Ray Tandy, whose knee
injury will keep him out of the
Gopher game, is the only man not in
tip-top shape for the clash. Tandy,
just back from a trip to Los Angeles
where he had consulted a bone
specialist, admitted before departure
that he would not play against
Minnesota. Bill Bardin, for the first
time since his injury in the Olympic
Club game, will be fit for the fray
Saturday.
Warning the student body not to
underrate the purple and gold of
Minnesota, Coach "Pop" Warner ex
pressed confidence in his men in a
short talk delivered before the train
pulled in.
"Vanderbilt was very lucky to run
up such a score on Minnesota," War
ner declared. "However, the boy.;
have the makings of a great team
this year. How great they will be
we cannot tell until they run up
against a tough team.
"Do not expect the boys to win
all of their games this year," Pop
continued. "There is plenty of tough
competition in our league." With
the weather report received from
Don Liebendorfer this morning that
rain had been falling regularly since
his arrival, the Card mentor has
cause for worry.
Rain May Handicap
A soggy field and a wet ball will
handicap the Redshirts considerably,
while the power style of attack em
ployed by the Gophers will not be
hampered By climatic conditions.
Pop refused to announce a starting
lineup, but intimated that the con
dition of the men after the trip will
determine who takes the field Sat
urday.
Those peppermint pants which ap
peared in the Big Game last year
are part of the equipment of the
team, but it is doubtful if they will
be used. Should a sunny day greet
the Warnermen, the passionate ap
parel will be worn, but if the skies
are sorrowing more staid garments
will clothe the Stanford team.
Minnesota will be striving to come
back after her defeat at the hands
of the Southern outfit, and the over
whelming opinion in her stronghold
that the Gophers are in for another
beating is certain to make the
Minnesota fight all the harder
Crisler, the new mentor, has suc
ceded in winning the regard of his
men, and they will be working for
| him as well as for their institution
While "Pop" Warner is never too
enthusiastic before a game, the con
fidence which he expresses in the
squad should be justified by the
showing the team will make Satur
day.

urday.
Those peppermint pants which ap
peared in the Big Game last year
are part of the equipment of the
team, but it is doubtful if they will
be used. Should a sunny day greet
the Warnermen, the passionate ap
parel will be worn, but if the skies
are sorrowing more staid garments
will clothe the Stanford team.
Minnesota will be striving to come
back after her defeat at the hands
of the Southern outfit, and the over
whelming opinion in her stronghold
that the Gophers are in for another
beating is certain to make the
Minnesota fight all the harder
Crisler, the new mentor, has suc
ceded in winning the regard of his
men, and they will be working for
| him as well as for their institution
While "Pop" Warner is never too
enthusiastic before a game, the con
fidence which he expresses in the
squad should be justified by the
showing the team will make Satur
day.
Except for such exercises as the
men can pick up during short train
stops, Stanford's Varsity football
squad will be without a workout
following their departure last night
from Palo Alto until their arrival
in Minneapolis Friday.
Thirty-three strong, the team
pulled out from the station last night
with the encouraging shouts of the
student body ringing in their ears.
With the exception of the last min
ute substitution of Tom Lambert for
Guido Caglieri, the squad was the
same as was announced by Warner.
Tandy Out
Captain Ray Tandy, whose knee
injury will keep him out of the
Gopher game, is the only man not in
tip-top shape for the clash. Tandy,
just back from a trip to Los Angeles
where he had consulted a bone
specialist, admitted before departure
that he would not play against
Minnesota. Bill Bardin, for the first
time since his injury in the Olympic
Club game, will be fit for the fray
Saturday.
Warning the student body not to
underrate the purple and gold of
Minnesota, Coach "Pop" Warner ex
pressed confidence in his men in a
short talk delivered before the train
pulled in.
"Vanderbilt was very lucky to run
up such a score on Minnesota," War
ner declared. "However, the boy.;
have the makings of a great team
this year. How great they will be
we cannot tell until they run up
against a tough team.
"Do not expect the boys to win
all of their games this year," Pop
continued. "There is plenty of tough
competition in our league." With
the weather report received from
Don Liebendorfer this morning that
rain had been falling regularly since
his arrival, the Card mentor has
cause for worry.
Rain May Handicap
A soggy field and a wet ball will
handicap the Redshirts considerably,
while the power style of attack em
ployed by the Gophers will not be
hampered By climatic conditions.
Pop refused to announce a starting
lineup, but intimated that the con
dition of the men after the trip will
determine who takes the field Sat
urday.
