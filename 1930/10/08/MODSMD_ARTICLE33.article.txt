# SOMETHING NEW AND A FEAT
## 
### 
With the change in the Sunday opening and closing hours of
the I nion dining halls made as a matter of convenience to students,
it is interesting to note that attendance at the Cellar has not de
creased as it has in the past.
Adoption of its new policy seeking to best serve the students,
the t nion management apparently has succeeded when the pa
tronage is said to have not dropped, despite the opening of fra
ternity and sorority houses and the eating cluhs and halls.
The C ellar management has reported complaints of delay in
service, but it is apparent that everyone cannot be served at the*
same time, especially when persons are clamoring for food
during a 45-minute period. Cause for most delay was explained
by Miss Christine Kicker, Union director, as being the rushes which
occur after classes.
I'atronage at the Cellar during the first days of the quarter
mounted to as high ;is 1.398 and slowly tapered off to 1.151 as the
eating places elsewhere on the campus and in Palo Alto began
i iperation.
I nder Miss Kicker the dining halls are beginning a new era in
Stanford's history. If Miss Kicker succeeds in satisfying the stu
dents she will have accomplished a feat. I ler organization is still
in a formative periodâ€”new systems require time to get under way.
