# DISCOVERING HIS CLASS

### 
America's "patriot." William Randolph llearst. has a new
"band wagon' on which to rideâ€”the official reception planned by
ihe city of San Francisco, llearst has achieved; he has been ex
polled from France. San Francisco is proud of him. and his en
trance into the city will be a triumphal procession to honor him as
a great citizen, "a public enemy of France."
The publisher's expulsion was not a matter of particular credit
or discredit; it was merely an incident, another of those incidents
which have served to make the llearst name "good copy" on tele
graph desks from coast to coast. .Yet the San Francisco Hoard of
Supervisors has seen fit to glori/y it by extending to I learst an
official welcome to the city. '
!t might be well for llearst to remember that Max Schnieling
and "Tex" < itiinan have also been officially welcomed by the Mayor
nf San Francisco.
