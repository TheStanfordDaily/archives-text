LOVE IN THE KOUGII—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
Mild amusement and light enter
tainment is offered by Robert Mont
gomery's first starring vehicle,
"Love in the Rough." Such incon
sequential stories and roles will not
add to the reputation of this young
and new actor, except perhaps to
the shop-girl audiences that crowd
(he San Francisco Fox or El Capi
tan.
There are a couple of'good songs
in the picture, and some funny mo
ments when the stuttering hotel
keeper talks. He is the one that
stuttered convincingly in ''The Big
House." But the story is time
worn; you know, the clerk gets into
big society because he is a good
golfer, meets the rich girl, poses as
a shipping magnate, never gets to
explain though he tries many times,
marries her, she finds out, they
break up, the golf match is on the
next day, our hero is playing badly
until little wifey appears on the
field, all reconciled to being a
clerk's wife, and he wins the match.
Formula three, variation sixteen.
Benny Rubin is funny at times,
if you like Benny Rubin; J. C. Nu
gent does a nice job as the boss;
but on the whole, "Love in the
Rough" is second-rate stuff, put out
to keep the weekly change of pic
tures ceaselessly in operation.—J. T.
DIAMONDS TO SIT ON. By J!f and
Petrov. Harper and Brothers,
New York, 1!):{(). At the Stan
ford Bookstore.
Billed as a "Russian Comedy of
Errors," "Diamonds To Sit On,"
translated by two optimistic ladies,
just escapes being amusing. The
comedy element is the usual
brusque, often ironic type of humor
that is difficult for anyone but a
Russian to appreciate. In addition,
• much of the humor is still in the
practical-joke stage of development,
flat and not subtle.
The plot is simple. On her death
bed, Madam Petukhov confesses to
her priest and her son-in-law that
when her household furnishings
were being confiscated during the
Communistic uprising, she hid her
jewels in one of the drawing-room
chairs. The remainder of the novel
is devoted to chasing the chairs,
which are found everywhere from
a theatre to a newspaper office. The
son-in-law's accomplice even mar
ries against his wishes to get one
of the chairs. Suspense is developed
by the controversy between the

! priest and the young man.
I Of course, all these efforts come
to naught. Like * Kataev's Soviet
comedy, "The Embezzlers,' this lit
tle tale ends tragically. One man
| goes crazy, another dies, and the
last one finally discovers that the
jewels have been fuund and used
to build a clubhouse for workmen.
With either a slightly stronger
: plot, or a better handling of the
, present plot, this book could be
made entertaining. In its present
i state, it just misses fire. —L. R.
TWINKLE, TWINKLE MOVIE
STAR. By Harry T. Brundidge.
Dutton & Co.
Harry T. Brundige, famous re
j porter of the St. Louis Star, in
"Twinkle, Twinkle Movie Star,"
■ gives to movie fandom one of the
i best collections of biographies of
1 cinema stars ever written.
| As a close follower and reviewer
of the canned drama, this writer
! has often wondered at the too-pleas
' ant pictures of motion picture stars
: and featured players painted by
cheap magazines. It is distinctly re
freshing to read Brundige's con
trasting accounts.
The author, who has gained na
-1 tional note for his activities in con
i nection with the Lingje murder
I case, has approached Hollywood
i from the angle of the trained news
paperman, rather than that of the
fawning, favor-seeking writer for
fan periodicals. The result is a col
lection of 31 biographies presenting
graphic and apparently authentic
accounts of the lives and histories
of the stars concerned.
Did you know that Clara Bow
was an unbeautiful Brooklyn raga
muffin shunned by her rough play
mates, and that she still is the best
spitter in the movie capital? That
Gary Cooper didn't want to get in
pictures? That Lupe Velez swears
like the proverbial pirate, is only
19 years old and needs to be
spanked?
That Esther Ralston slept in hay
stacks as a child when things didn't
go well for her Shakespeare-minded
family? That Ronald Coleman in
real life is like the character he
portrayed in "Beau Geste"? That
there is a pathetic, sympathy-inspir
ing side to the story of Mary Nolan,
the former Imogene Wilson?
Many of the things told by Brun
didge have never before appeared
in print. Frankly, "Twinkle, Twinkle
Movie Star" is the best bit of mo
tion picture biography the writer
! has ever read. —L. M. C.

bed, Madam Petukhov confesses to
her priest and her son-in-law that
when her household furnishings
were being confiscated during the
Communistic uprising, she hid her
jewels in one of the drawing-room
chairs. The remainder of the novel
is devoted to chasing the chairs,
which are found everywhere from
a theatre to a newspaper office. The
son-in-law's accomplice even mar
ries against his wishes to get one
of the chairs. Suspense is developed
by the controversy between the

comedy, "The Embezzlers,' this lit

TWINKLE, TWINKLE MOVIE
STAR. By Harry T. Brundidge.
Dutton & Co.
Harry T. Brundige, famous re
j porter of the St. Louis Star, in
"Twinkle, Twinkle Movie Star,"
■ gives to movie fandom one of the
i best collections of biographies of
1 cinema stars ever written.
| As a close follower and reviewer
of the canned drama, this writer
! has often wondered at the too-pleas
' ant pictures of motion picture stars
: and featured players painted by
cheap magazines. It is distinctly re
freshing to read Brundige's con
trasting accounts.
The author, who has gained na
-1 tional note for his activities in con
i nection with the Lingje murder
I case, has approached Hollywood
i from the angle of the trained news
paperman, rather than that of the
fawning, favor-seeking writer for
fan periodicals. The result is a col
lection of 31 biographies presenting
graphic and apparently authentic
accounts of the lives and histories
of the stars concerned.
Did you know that Clara Bow
was an unbeautiful Brooklyn raga
muffin shunned by her rough play
mates, and that she still is the best
spitter in the movie capital? That
Gary Cooper didn't want to get in
pictures? That Lupe Velez swears
like the proverbial pirate, is only
19 years old and needs to be
spanked?
That Esther Ralston slept in hay
stacks as a child when things didn't
go well for her Shakespeare-minded
family? That Ronald Coleman in
real life is like the character he
portrayed in "Beau Geste"? That
there is a pathetic, sympathy-inspir
ing side to the story of Mary Nolan,
the former Imogene Wilson?
Many of the things told by Brun
didge have never before appeared
in print. Frankly, "Twinkle, Twinkle
Movie Star" is the best bit of mo
tion picture biography the writer
! has ever read. —L. M. C.
LOVE IN THE KOUGII—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
Mild amusement and light enter
tainment is offered by Robert Mont
gomery's first starring vehicle,
"Love in the Rough." Such incon
sequential stories and roles will not
add to the reputation of this young
and new actor, except perhaps to
the shop-girl audiences that crowd
(he San Francisco Fox or El Capi
tan.
There are a couple of'good songs
in the picture, and some funny mo
ments when the stuttering hotel
keeper talks. He is the one that
stuttered convincingly in ''The Big
House." But the story is time
worn; you know, the clerk gets into
big society because he is a good
golfer, meets the rich girl, poses as
a shipping magnate, never gets to
explain though he tries many times,
marries her, she finds out, they
break up, the golf match is on the
next day, our hero is playing badly
until little wifey appears on the
field, all reconciled to being a
clerk's wife, and he wins the match.
Formula three, variation sixteen.
Benny Rubin is funny at times,
if you like Benny Rubin; J. C. Nu
gent does a nice job as the boss;
but on the whole, "Love in the
Rough" is second-rate stuff, put out
to keep the weekly change of pic
tures ceaselessly in operation.—J. T.

The author, who has gained na
-1 tional note for his activities in con
i nection with the Lingje murder
I case, has approached Hollywood
i from the angle of the trained news
paperman, rather than that of the
fawning, favor-seeking writer for
fan periodicals. The result is a col
lection of 31 biographies presenting
graphic and apparently authentic
accounts of the lives and histories
of the stars concerned.
Did you know that Clara Bow
was an unbeautiful Brooklyn raga
muffin shunned by her rough play
mates, and that she still is the best
spitter in the movie capital? That
Gary Cooper didn't want to get in
pictures? That Lupe Velez swears
like the proverbial pirate, is only
19 years old and needs to be
spanked?
That Esther Ralston slept in hay
stacks as a child when things didn't
go well for her Shakespeare-minded
family? That Ronald Coleman in
real life is like the character he
portrayed in "Beau Geste"? That
there is a pathetic, sympathy-inspir
ing side to the story of Mary Nolan,
the former Imogene Wilson?
Many of the things told by Brun
didge have never before appeared
in print. Frankly, "Twinkle, Twinkle
Movie Star" is the best bit of mo
tion picture biography the writer
! has ever read. —L. M. C.
LOVE IN THE KOUGII—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
Mild amusement and light enter
tainment is offered by Robert Mont
gomery's first starring vehicle,
"Love in the Rough." Such incon
sequential stories and roles will not
add to the reputation of this young
and new actor, except perhaps to
the shop-girl audiences that crowd
(he San Francisco Fox or El Capi
tan.
There are a couple of'good songs
in the picture, and some funny mo
ments when the stuttering hotel
keeper talks. He is the one that
stuttered convincingly in ''The Big
House." But the story is time
worn; you know, the clerk gets into
big society because he is a good
golfer, meets the rich girl, poses as
a shipping magnate, never gets to
explain though he tries many times,
marries her, she finds out, they
break up, the golf match is on the
next day, our hero is playing badly
until little wifey appears on the
field, all reconciled to being a
clerk's wife, and he wins the match.
Formula three, variation sixteen.
Benny Rubin is funny at times,
if you like Benny Rubin; J. C. Nu
gent does a nice job as the boss;
but on the whole, "Love in the
Rough" is second-rate stuff, put out
to keep the weekly change of pic
tures ceaselessly in operation.—J. T.
DIAMONDS TO SIT ON. By J!f and
Petrov. Harper and Brothers,
New York, 1!):{(). At the Stan
ford Bookstore.
Billed as a "Russian Comedy of
Errors," "Diamonds To Sit On,"
translated by two optimistic ladies,
just escapes being amusing. The
comedy element is the usual
brusque, often ironic type of humor
that is difficult for anyone but a
Russian to appreciate. In addition,
• much of the humor is still in the
practical-joke stage of development,
flat and not subtle.
The plot is simple. On her death
bed, Madam Petukhov confesses to
her priest and her son-in-law that
when her household furnishings
were being confiscated during the
Communistic uprising, she hid her
jewels in one of the drawing-room
chairs. The remainder of the novel
is devoted to chasing the chairs,
which are found everywhere from
a theatre to a newspaper office. The
son-in-law's accomplice even mar
ries against his wishes to get one
of the chairs. Suspense is developed
by the controversy between the

! priest and the young man.
I Of course, all these efforts come
to naught. Like * Kataev's Soviet
comedy, "The Embezzlers,' this lit
tle tale ends tragically. One man
| goes crazy, another dies, and the
last one finally discovers that the
jewels have been fuund and used
to build a clubhouse for workmen.
With either a slightly stronger
: plot, or a better handling of the
, present plot, this book could be
made entertaining. In its present
i state, it just misses fire. —L. R.
