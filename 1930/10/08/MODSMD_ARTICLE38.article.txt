# Cabbages and Things

### 
After the send-off we gave them
yesterday, the team must feel honor
| bound to do something spectacular
Jin the game Saturday. Until we ;
have definite word from them,
though, we're worried. What if
! someone, in a careless mood, bun
dled them all (iff on the wrong !
train, going to Oshkosh or any other
place where football is still a wick
-1 ed, rough game?
I For months we've been wanting j
to prove our ability to teach people ;
1 things thai aren't in books. At last, ]
someone has asked us a question.
So we're announcing a series of j
strictly educational comments on
matters of public interest. j
The topic for consideration
today is—"Do college students
snore?"
(The author risked his life,
love, and an alleged reputation
for truthfulness, obtaining data
for these articles.)
There are two main classes of;
students—men and women. There
are two main subdivisions of these
groups—Men and women who snore
and men and women who don't
snore.
Members of the second group are
more to be avoided than the first.
They usually talk in their sleep.
Scientists say that people talk
in their sleep because they are
tired. We feel certain that the
habit is merely a freakish form
of boasting.

We're campaigning for a consti
tutional amendment whereby all
i students who talk in their sleep
i will be forced to sleep on sleeping
! porches, where the things they say
may offer some amusement to the
outside world. Under this system, if
; two talkers should start an argu
ment, calls for assistance would be
more easily heard.
(By the college handbook
code, one suffering from night
mare would shriek "Hey, hey!"
for help . . . )
"A Stanford Symphony in
Snore" sounds like an excellent
topic for a Music student's Mas
ter's thesis.
j Rooming with someone who sleep
talks is good training for a student
who plans to travel. It takes a keen
ear for languages to distinguish
everything said. Some subjects jum
ble their words most inconsider
ately.
Rooming with someone who
snores is good training for a
musician- or steel-riveter-to-be.
There are musical snores, and
some that aren't. The problem
is to be discriminating without
offending your friends.
A musical snorer may lull you to
sleep. II you choose the other kind,
you're liable 1o insanity or a de
spairing death.
And here, again, if you do one of
those things, these comments won't
have done you very much good.
Will they?

j Rooming with someone who sleep
talks is good training for a student
who plans to travel. It takes a keen
ear for languages to distinguish
everything said. Some subjects jum
ble their words most inconsider
ately.
Rooming with someone who
snores is good training for a
musician- or steel-riveter-to-be.
There are musical snores, and
some that aren't. The problem
is to be discriminating without
offending your friends.
A musical snorer may lull you to
sleep. II you choose the other kind,
you're liable 1o insanity or a de
spairing death.
And here, again, if you do one of
those things, these comments won't
have done you very much good.
Will they?
After the send-off we gave them
yesterday, the team must feel honor

Jin the game Saturday. Until we ;
have definite word from them,
though, we're worried. What if

dled them all (iff on the wrong !
train, going to Oshkosh or any other
place where football is still a wick
-1 ed, rough game?
I For months we've been wanting j
to prove our ability to teach people ;
1 things thai aren't in books. At last, ]
someone has asked us a question.
So we're announcing a series of j
strictly educational comments on
matters of public interest. j
The topic for consideration
today is—"Do college students
snore?"
(The author risked his life,
love, and an alleged reputation
for truthfulness, obtaining data
for these articles.)
There are two main classes of;
students—men and women. There
are two main subdivisions of these
groups—Men and women who snore
and men and women who don't
snore.
Members of the second group are
more to be avoided than the first.
They usually talk in their sleep.
Scientists say that people talk
in their sleep because they are
tired. We feel certain that the
habit is merely a freakish form
of boasting.

We're campaigning for a consti
tutional amendment whereby all
i students who talk in their sleep
i will be forced to sleep on sleeping
! porches, where the things they say
may offer some amusement to the
outside world. Under this system, if
; two talkers should start an argu
ment, calls for assistance would be
more easily heard.
(By the college handbook
code, one suffering from night
mare would shriek "Hey, hey!"
for help . . . )
"A Stanford Symphony in
Snore" sounds like an excellent
topic for a Music student's Mas
ter's thesis.
