# HEMPEN LADDERS USED FOR UNION TOWER BEDROOMS
## 
### 
Sleeping quarters which are
reached via rope ladder have
been in vogue 011 the campus
for seven years, perhaps un
known to the major part of the
student body. They are located
in either tower of the Union
and boast no luxury except all
the fresh air anyone could
wish.
Seven years ago an ingenious
occupant of a Union tower
room found a small square hole
in the ceiling and began ex
ploring. He discovered a large
semi-open room beneath the
dome, through the arches of
which truly noble breezes
could be felt. This unknown
fresh air hound and his cohorts
hauled their beds up the walls
of the building and during the
entire year slept in the tower
through rain, wind, and flies.
The occupants of the other
tower suite followed their lead
and since that time all inhab
itants of these rooms have slept
in the dove cote bedrooms to
avoid the effort of lowering the
beds back to civilization.
