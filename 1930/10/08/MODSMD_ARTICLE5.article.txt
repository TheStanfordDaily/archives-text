# SPORTS UPHELD BY DR. MURRA
## Says Sane Education Duty Of Universities 
### 
"I maintain the immense worth
whileness of physical development,"
stated Dr. Augustus T. Murray of
the Classical Literature department
in a lecture last night in the As
sembly Hall on "Greek Athletics —
the Model and the Warning."
"Our schools and universities have
a great responsibility in the sane
development of students in prepara
tion for life. Plato himself explains
this same theory in his 'Republic,'"
Murray continued.
"The danger of modern sport, as
in that of Greece, is to cai'e more
for victory than for achievement;
to disregard the means to victory;
to seek the spectacle, not the sport.
We must take the lesson of Greek
experience to heart and train our
men and women with sanity toward
the ideal of normal physical de
velopment.
"Greek men, in the beginning,
were trained in a sane fashion to
athletic perfection as a preparation
for a full life. We find many exam
ples of endurance and athletic
prowess in Greek literature. Hero
dotus tells us the story of the Battle
of Marathon, the first achievement
of the Greeks in freeing themselves
from the Persians. The battle began
with a mile charge made on the run
against the Persians.
"What interests us now is not the
question of the historical accuracy
of this astonishing statement, but
the fact that Herodotus, himself, did
not doubt it. To the Greek mind
such a feat was not impossible."
