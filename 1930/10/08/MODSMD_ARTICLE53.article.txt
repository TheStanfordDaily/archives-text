When Kipling aced the buys with
his remark, "East is East and West
is West, but never the twain shall
meet," the noted Britisher had not
looked at the 1930 football sched
ule. For no less than twelve tilts
ire in store for twenty-four insti
tutions of learning, or rather were
before Oregon took Drake last Fri
day.
A glance at the forthcoming clash
es reveals the following: U.S.C. vs.
Denver University (the second in
vasion of the Pacific Coast by a
Rocky Mountain team); Fordham
vs. St. Mary's; St. Ignatius vs. De
Paul; U.S.C. vs. Notre Dame; Ore
gon State vs. West Virginia; Wash
ington State vs. Villanova; U.S.C.
vs. Hawaii; Idaho vs. Hawaii; and
of course Stanford vs. Minnesota
uid Stanford vs. Dartmouth.
Added to these games are the
Fast-West Shrine game set for some
lime in December, and the annual
Rose Bowl game in Pasadena on
January I. Participants in the Pasa
dena clash will be'selected at a later
date, while the Shrine teams are
composed of picked men from East
ern and Western institutions of
higher educations.
When the Ducks played havoc
with Drake beneath the incan
<l< scents at Soldier's Field, the West
won its first intersectional game of
Ihe season. That 14-7 tune played
by Kitzmiller and his Oregonians
before the Chicagoans was sweet
music for Spears, for he showed
Ihe boys back home that the Pacific
Slope produced a few stars on the
gridiron.
When the Redshirts meet Minne
sota Saturday, a second intersec
tional contest will be under way.
During the past, the Gophers were
Ihe bane . . . (subtle, aren't we) . . .
of the Northwest, but this appears
to be a long hard winter for the
purple and gold clad gridmen.
But two teams from the Far West
invade the Eastern slope to treat
ihe Atlantic gridiron fans with a
vision of another and better brand
of football. The galloping Gaels and
Gauls of Moraga meet Fordham in
New York, while Washington State
in making her bow with Villanova
also travel as far as the rails permit.
The frenzied fans who back the
Trojans will have an opportunity to
watch their team meet Denver,
Hawaii, and, lastly but not least,
Knutc Rock lie's kiddies from Notre
Dame. How tough the first two in
tersectional games will be is prob
lematical, but at least the teams
will have a chance to visit Los An
geles.
California has scheduled no cross
country conflicts this season. When
the array of teams confronting the
Bears is examined, the reason be
comes obvious. There is more than
a grain of truth in the contention
from Berkeley that plenty of oppo
sition is found within the Western
domain.

When Kipling aced the buys with

is West, but never the twain shall
meet," the noted Britisher had not

A glance at the forthcoming clash
es reveals the following: U.S.C. vs.
Denver University (the second in
vasion of the Pacific Coast by a
Rocky Mountain team); Fordham
vs. St. Mary's; St. Ignatius vs. De
Paul; U.S.C. vs. Notre Dame; Ore

ington State vs. Villanova; U.S.C.
vs. Hawaii; Idaho vs. Hawaii; and
of course Stanford vs. Minnesota

Added to these games are the
Fast-West Shrine game set for some
lime in December, and the annual
Rose Bowl game in Pasadena on
January I. Participants in the Pasa
dena clash will be'selected at a later
date, while the Shrine teams are
composed of picked men from East

higher educations.
When the Ducks played havoc
with Drake beneath the incan
<l< scents at Soldier's Field, the West
won its first intersectional game of
Ihe season. That 14-7 tune played
by Kitzmiller and his Oregonians
before the Chicagoans was sweet
music for Spears, for he showed
Ihe boys back home that the Pacific
Slope produced a few stars on the
gridiron.
When the Redshirts meet Minne
sota Saturday, a second intersec

During the past, the Gophers were

to be a long hard winter for the

But two teams from the Far West
invade the Eastern slope to treat
ihe Atlantic gridiron fans with a
vision of another and better brand
of football. The galloping Gaels and
Gauls of Moraga meet Fordham in
New York, while Washington State
in making her bow with Villanova
also travel as far as the rails permit.
The frenzied fans who back the
