# Yearlings Will Face Oaklanders
## FROSH MENTOR SECURES IT FOR GRIDSTERS Experience Needed by Babe Eleven Before Major Games of Season 
### 
Intending to give his freshman
eleven as much experience as pos
sible before the more important as
signments of mid-season, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw has secured a
game for his babes next Saturday
morning at 9:30 o'clock on the
fueshman practice field with the
Armstrong Business College ol' Oak
land.
Though a rest for the week-end
was on the yearling program, the
babip mentor believes that the Arm
strong eleven will prove little more
than a workout for his warriors.
Lacking in little but experience,
the Card freshmen have demon
strated their possibilities in no un
certain manner in their first two
starts of the season. With but four
men coming to his outfit with stel
lar prep school records, Bradshaw
has uncovered talent with little
previous gridiron experience.
In the backlield Bradshaw has a
fine quintet of ball-carriers in
Maentz, Hillman, Lipscomb, White,
and Anderson. Maentz hails from
Culver Military Academy, where
he was somewhat of a sensation in
prep school ranks. His work in
kicking and passing has been beau
tiful to watch, though for the punt
ing job Bradshaw has Anderson,
who has been on the injured list
but will probably do the booting in
the future.
Though Anderson came to the
Farm ranks unheralded, the babe
coach's plan to assign to him Ihe
kicking duty which Maentz carried
so creditably against Santa Clara
speaks of confidence in his ability.
The other backfield man with a
high school record is Ilillman, who
was a star at Hollywood High. He is
a brother to the Hillman of varsity
fame, and seems to be following in
the footsteps of his kin. White, who
looked so good at half against the
Broncos Saturday, has had little
high school experience.
With but three linesmen of much
previous grid competition, Bradshaw
has a fighting forward wall against
which opponents have been able to
do little. Monsalve and Miller, ends,
performed for Lowell High last
year, while Tatum starred at tackle
for the Los Angeles High champion
ship eleven.
Edelen at end, Lyman at tackle,
and Tarver, Kantzner, and Alden
in the center of the line are the
comparatively inexperienced men
who have dispelled Bradshaw's
fears that the forward wall might
prove the weak point in his outfit.

Farm ranks unheralded, the babe
coach's plan to assign to him Ihe
kicking duty which Maentz carried
so creditably against Santa Clara
speaks of confidence in his ability.
The other backfield man with a
high school record is Ilillman, who
was a star at Hollywood High. He is
a brother to the Hillman of varsity
fame, and seems to be following in
the footsteps of his kin. White, who
looked so good at half against the
Broncos Saturday, has had little
high school experience.
With but three linesmen of much
previous grid competition, Bradshaw
has a fighting forward wall against
which opponents have been able to
do little. Monsalve and Miller, ends,
performed for Lowell High last
year, while Tatum starred at tackle
for the Los Angeles High champion
ship eleven.
Edelen at end, Lyman at tackle,
and Tarver, Kantzner, and Alden
in the center of the line are the
comparatively inexperienced men
who have dispelled Bradshaw's
fears that the forward wall might
prove the weak point in his outfit.
Intending to give his freshman
eleven as much experience as pos
sible before the more important as
signments of mid-season, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw has secured a
game for his babes next Saturday
morning at 9:30 o'clock on the
fueshman practice field with the
Armstrong Business College ol' Oak
land.
Though a rest for the week-end
was on the yearling program, the
babip mentor believes that the Arm
strong eleven will prove little more
than a workout for his warriors.
Lacking in little but experience,
the Card freshmen have demon
strated their possibilities in no un
certain manner in their first two
starts of the season. With but four
men coming to his outfit with stel
lar prep school records, Bradshaw
has uncovered talent with little
previous gridiron experience.
In the backlield Bradshaw has a
fine quintet of ball-carriers in
Maentz, Hillman, Lipscomb, White,
and Anderson. Maentz hails from
Culver Military Academy, where
he was somewhat of a sensation in
prep school ranks. His work in
kicking and passing has been beau
tiful to watch, though for the punt
ing job Bradshaw has Anderson,
who has been on the injured list
but will probably do the booting in
the future.
Though Anderson came to the
Farm ranks unheralded, the babe
coach's plan to assign to him Ihe
