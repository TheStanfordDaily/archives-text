# UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN..
## Artificial Sunlight for Night Baseball Is Here to Stay, Believes Murray; Sam Breadon Favors It 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The year of 1930 will go down in
baseball history as the year of the
Great Experiment. Whether or not
this Great Experiment (i.e., Night
Baseball) will prove something per
manent or merely a passing fancy
remains to be seen. Nevertheless,
minor league baseball at night,
which, according to Bob Edgren, was
tried out in San Antonio, Texas as
far back as 1897, proved to be a
howling success, and many influen
tial men connected with the Na
tional Pastime think that it is here
to stay.
The most interesting statement
about the future of the night game
was made by Sam Breadon, presi
dent of the St. Louis Cardinals, who,
when interviewed by various base
ball writers at his farm outside of
St. Louis, replied to the question,
"Do you think the night game will
ever be tried in the National?" as
follows:
"I certainly do. When we opened
under lights at Houston we played
to 15,000 fans, and it might surprise
you to know that in every Texas
league city where lights have been
installed the attendance is up 100
to 200 per cent. Vote that down if

you will.
"I am in baseball trying to make
both ends meet. If I can get larger
crowds out to the park with night
baseball and can pay visiting teams
a larger sum of money when they
come to St. Louis, there will be no
kick from those clubs.
"We must all meet the payrolls
and they have been mounting from
year to year. So far as we are con
cerned the attendance has been as
good as could be expected. But if
I can get crowds of 15,000 to 18,000
out at night instead of 3,500 to 5.000
in the daytime, nobody is going to
condemn me."
Artificial sunlight is here to stay,
as far as baseball is concerned, in
my opinion, and I think it will soon
take hold in the major leagues. What
if we do all become owl-eyed from
attending games in the Texas
(Guinan) League, and what if the
movies do go bankrupt because of
miniature golf and night baseball,
isn't the working man entitled to his
National Pastime, and how can he
get out to see it in the afternoon if
he's working?
Let's have night baseball in the
Major Leagues!

Major Leagues!

The year of 1930 will go down in
baseball history as the year of the
Great Experiment. Whether or not
this Great Experiment (i.e., Night
Baseball) will prove something per
manent or merely a passing fancy
remains to be seen. Nevertheless,
minor league baseball at night,
which, according to Bob Edgren, was
tried out in San Antonio, Texas as
far back as 1897, proved to be a
howling success, and many influen
tial men connected with the Na
tional Pastime think that it is here
to stay.
The most interesting statement
about the future of the night game
was made by Sam Breadon, presi
dent of the St. Louis Cardinals, who,
when interviewed by various base
ball writers at his farm outside of
St. Louis, replied to the question,
"Do you think the night game will
ever be tried in the National?" as
follows:
"I certainly do. When we opened
under lights at Houston we played
to 15,000 fans, and it might surprise
you to know that in every Texas
league city where lights have been
installed the attendance is up 100
to 200 per cent. Vote that down if

you will.
"I am in baseball trying to make
both ends meet. If I can get larger
crowds out to the park with night
baseball and can pay visiting teams
a larger sum of money when they
come to St. Louis, there will be no
kick from those clubs.
"We must all meet the payrolls
and they have been mounting from
year to year. So far as we are con
cerned the attendance has been as
good as could be expected. But if
I can get crowds of 15,000 to 18,000
out at night instead of 3,500 to 5.000
in the daytime, nobody is going to
condemn me."
Artificial sunlight is here to stay,
as far as baseball is concerned, in
my opinion, and I think it will soon
take hold in the major leagues. What
if we do all become owl-eyed from
attending games in the Texas
(Guinan) League, and what if the
movies do go bankrupt because of
miniature golf and night baseball,
isn't the working man entitled to his
National Pastime, and how can he
get out to see it in the afternoon if
he's working?
Let's have night baseball in the
