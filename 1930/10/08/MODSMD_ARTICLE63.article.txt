# SOCCER TEAM SCHEDULED FOR TOUGH SEASON
## Opener Will Be Played Saturday With Speedy San Franciscans 
### 
Six hard games are listed on the
| varsity soccer team's 1930 schedule
1 which was announced yesterday by
| Coach Harry Maloney. Opening the
. season Saturday at 3:30 o'clock with
i the Hornets team of San Francisco,
. the soccer men take on the Rovers,
another San Francisco eleven on Oc-
S tober 18, and then meet California in
j the first game of the annual series
' on November 1, October 25 being
an open date on account ol the
U.S.C. football game on that day.
The American Legion team comes
to the campus for a tilt November
8: California will play the second
j game of the series here the follow
ing week-end, November 15, and the
season is scheduled to close with the
final Bear-Card contest on the 22nd
of that month. All of the games
except the first and third California
tilts will be played here.
According to Maloney, the Card
kickers are going to have a full
sized assignment on their hands
when they meet the Hornets. Com
posed of boys who have played to
gether since they were in high
| school, the San Francisco team is a
| very fast organization and has a
I head start on the Stanford squad in
j the matter of practice this season.
One reason for scheduling both
: the Hornets and the Rovers, Ma
| loney declared, is that both play a
I fast game and should provide ex
i cellent experience for the Cards.
Although the Redshirt eleven has
I had less than one week of practice,
jit is rounding into shape already,
I and has displayed very promising
5 teamwork in the first two scrim
! mages held. A large group of vet
| erans have returned, so the first
string should take less than the
I usual time to gel under way.
