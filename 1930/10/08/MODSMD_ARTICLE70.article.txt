I One frosh sustained a wrenched
i shoulder and another was rendered
violently ill as a result of the mid
night. raid on Encina by the Sopho
more Class yesterday.
Frank D. Springer, in the midst
of the clothes-tearing contest which
resulted from the raid, incurred the
badly wrenched shoulder. A fellow-
I member of the class of 1934 was so
upset by the expected raid that he
was treated by a Palo Alto doctor.
In spite of the physical damages
incurred, far less damage than usual
was done to the hall, according to
authorities. Elliot H. Ayers, man
j ager of dormitories, stated yesterday
I that no water had been turned on
and that "thhere was less damage
j than usual. Due to the figting tak
i ing place on the front lawn instead
| of in the lobby, there was no dam
! age as far as I can find out except
i some sore heads and ankles."
