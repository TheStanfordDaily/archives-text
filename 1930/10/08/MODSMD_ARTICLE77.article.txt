### 
LONDON, Oct. 7. </P) â€” Mrs.
Bruce, British sports woman, re
ported wrecked on her flight to
India, was stated here to be at
tempting to beat Amy Johnson's
time to Australia.
She was quoted before her de
parture as saying:
"I intend to embark on a solo
flight which no woman has ever
before attempted. One possibility is
that 1 fly across Europe, Asia, down
to Australia, then through China
and Japan. In this event I should
continue my journey by boat to the
United States, flying across America
and taking ship again to cross the
Atlantic.
' This route would take me ap
proximately 30,000 miles, but the
actual course of my flight will be
determined as the flight progresses."
