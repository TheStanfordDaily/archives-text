### 
PEIPING, China, Oct. 7. (/P) â€”
Bringing a record bag of prehistoric
fossils, the Central Asiatic Expedi
tion, led by Dr. Roy Chapman An
drews, the American anthropologist,
returned here today after five
months of intensive work in the
Gobi desert.
In the opinion of Walter C. Gran
ger, chief paleontologist, who di
rected operations in this field, this
year's collection is the biggest and
scientifically most important made
by the expedition since its first ex
plorations in 1922.
