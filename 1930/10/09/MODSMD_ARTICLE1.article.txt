# FROSH BIND 74 SOPHS TO WIN TIE-UP FRACAS
## Smith Leads Class of '34 to Victory; No Serious Injuries Received OBSERVE REGULATIONS 
### Ranson Holmes 
Game but greatly outnumbered,
the class of '33 went down before
a howling mob of freshmen in the
annual "iie-up tit the Stadium yes
terday afternoon to the tune of 74
sophomores ensnared to 26 van
quished members of '34.
The result of the one-sided eon
test became apparent at the outset,
when a hundred-and-fifty-odd
freshmen lined up along the north
ern goal line to face scarcely a hun
dred sophomores at the opposite
end of the field. These figures are
the estimate of Paul Speegle, chair
man of the A.S.S.U. committee in
charge of the "tie-up.'
Kite Is Leader
Led by "Ted" Kite, guard on the
varsity football squad, the men of
'33 put up a gallant light, but the
overwhelming odds of Captain
"Bud" Smith's freshmen were too
much for them. Time and again a
nearly successful capture on the
part of the sophomores was broken
up by a deluge of the younger men.
For the first time in the history
of the "tie-up" the regulations laid
down in the A.S.S.U. by-laws were
carried out to the letter. The pris
oners were all taken to their op
ponents' ends of the field, where
they were guarded and kept from
re-entering the contest by sponsors
and members of the Rally Commit
tee and Skull and Snakes, who po
liced the clash.
Sponsor Bound
To show that no hard feelings
were had and that while they might
be down they were not out, several
of the sophomores seized and bound
Bob Brown, vice-president of the
Associated Students, sponsor, and
two-miler on the varsity track
squad, and Tom Neikirk, half-miler
and also a sponsor, shortly after
being released.
The outcome of the contest was
judged by Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, and the captains of the five
major sport teams. No serious in
jury to any of the contestants has
been reported.
Bud Smith was selected by the
sponsors to head the freshmen after
it was found that "Dud" Butte was
ineligible, as he had not registered
in the University. Smith was sec
ond in the previous election for
leader.

and also a sponsor, shortly after
being released.
The outcome of the contest was
judged by Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, and the captains of the five
major sport teams. No serious in
jury to any of the contestants has
been reported.
Bud Smith was selected by the
sponsors to head the freshmen after
it was found that "Dud" Butte was
ineligible, as he had not registered
in the University. Smith was sec
ond in the previous election for
leader.
Game but greatly outnumbered,
the class of '33 went down before
a howling mob of freshmen in the
annual "iie-up tit the Stadium yes
terday afternoon to the tune of 74
sophomores ensnared to 26 van
quished members of '34.
The result of the one-sided eon
test became apparent at the outset,
when a hundred-and-fifty-odd
freshmen lined up along the north
ern goal line to face scarcely a hun
dred sophomores at the opposite
end of the field. These figures are
the estimate of Paul Speegle, chair
man of the A.S.S.U. committee in
charge of the "tie-up.'
Kite Is Leader
Led by "Ted" Kite, guard on the
varsity football squad, the men of
'33 put up a gallant light, but the
overwhelming odds of Captain
"Bud" Smith's freshmen were too
much for them. Time and again a
nearly successful capture on the
part of the sophomores was broken
up by a deluge of the younger men.
For the first time in the history
of the "tie-up" the regulations laid
down in the A.S.S.U. by-laws were
carried out to the letter. The pris
oners were all taken to their op
ponents' ends of the field, where
they were guarded and kept from
re-entering the contest by sponsors
and members of the Rally Commit
tee and Skull and Snakes, who po
liced the clash.
Sponsor Bound
To show that no hard feelings
were had and that while they might
be down they were not out, several
of the sophomores seized and bound
Bob Brown, vice-president of the
Associated Students, sponsor, and
two-miler on the varsity track
squad, and Tom Neikirk, half-miler
and also a sponsor, shortly after
being released.
