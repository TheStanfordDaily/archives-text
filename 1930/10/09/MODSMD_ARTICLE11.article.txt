# SANTA BARBARA CITIZENS WATCH MIRAGE OF CITY
## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA, Calif,
Oct. 8 (./P). —A rare ocean mir
age, appearing over the beach
front here yesterday, and pic
turing a city by the sea—with
autos, boats, green hills and
distant, brown mountains —was
being discussed today by resi
dents of this resort city. Num
erous persons along the beach
saw the phantom city.
When first sighted the phas
ma appeared to be moving out
to sea at a tremendous speed.
Suddenly, the witnesses said,
it stopped and appeared to
hover over the quiet waters of
the channel. A thick haze then
dropped and the ethereal city
faded away.
Old timers along the beach
front here said similar mirages
have occurred previously, us
ually when a fog moves in on
a dusty day. They believe the
dust, banked by fog, reflects
the image of Santa Barbara
upon the sky.
The mirage was so clear even
persons appeared to be mov
ing about the streets and trees
could be discerned.
