# WOMEN'S NEW LOCKOUT RULES GO INTO EFFECT TODAY FOR TRIAL YEAR
## Success of New Lockout Rules Depends Upon Education And Co-operation of Men, Is Belief of Dean Yost on Eve of System's Inception 
### 
Individual integrity is essential for university women.
The success of the new lockout rules depends on the education and
co-operation of the men.
Individual pleasure must be sacrificed for the good of the University.
No woman shall drink liquor on or off the campus.
No woman shall go to a man's room without a chaperone.

Such were the requests mude of
j woman students -last night by Dean
j Mary Yost on the eve of the trial
year for the lockout regulations
which go into effect tonight. These
were the factors the women were
i expected to observe by the Univer
sity in the administration of their
j new freedom.
"Besides co-operation in the Uni
: versity regulations, it is necessary
that there be strict individual in
tegrity," she said. '"Anyone can get
| around any rule, for the rules were
drawn up for women of absolute
| integrity. If anyone signs out for a
place and doesn't go there, the in
dividual is not wanted on the cam-
I pus docs not belong here.
"Educate Boys"
"You must educate the boys if
' you want the regulations to succeed,
; for without their understanding and
j co-operation the rules will be a
failure, especially in regard to noise
when returning to the living group.
"The life of the group must come
j before individual pleasure, and be
i cause there is no way to tell whether
these new rules will be for the good
of ihe group, the President is mak
i ing this a trial year.
"The University asks that no wo
man ever touch one drop of liquor
j unless with her parents or guard
j ians, either on or off the campus.
Ii liquor is brought on the campus
i it involves not only yourselves but
; the living group.
i "No woman shall go to a man's
, room on or off the campus without
! a chaperone. No woman must enter
! a man's club, fraternity, or hall room
I unless accompanied by another
! woman."
Social Background Told

which were enthusiastically received
by the women, Dean Yost gave a

, year, but that it would be entirely
j up to the women.
