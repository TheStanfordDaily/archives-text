### 
BOSTON, Oct. 8. (/P) —City and
American Legion police controlled
the downtown streets today after a
night of disorder by mobs of hood
lums.
Overturned automobiles, the
ashes of a score of bonfires that had
been built in downtown thorough
fares and on Boston Common, and
here and there a battered head,
marked the passing of the rowdies,
who took advantage of the privileges
extended the Legionnaires on a
night of frivolity after the annual'
parade in connection with the Na
tional Convention.
At one time it. seemed that the
melee in Park Square might gain
the proportions of a vicious riot.
Dennis J. Lorden, heading a detail
o) federal agents, had arrested four
local men for peddling liquor in the
Square. As he started marching his
men away, the crowd, composed
mostly of the toughs, who ranged in
age from 14 to 20, moved on him.
Fists began to fly and the agents
had their backs to the wall when a
squad of police forced their way
through the crowd to rescue them.
