# Great Britain To Build High Tariff Walls
## Empire Builders To Build Preferential System For Kingdom 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 8. i/P) — Great
Britain's Imperial Conference made
plans today to build high tariff walls
around the United Kingdom and the
dominions beyond the seas as a pro
tective measure against the "eco
nomic blizzard" that has hit the
world.
It was J. H. Thomas, for the home
government, who called the present
depression a blizzard when he
opened today's session, but it was
Premier R. B. Benett of Canada—
where they know how to deal with
blizzards—who took the center of
the conference stage.
Bennett quickly aroused interest
with a definite proposal of ten per
cent addition preference in the
Canadian market for the mother
country and for other empire units
which would return the favor.
Canada Invites Delegates
Moreover, the Canadian Prime
Minister invited the Empire dele
gates to meet in Ottawa next spring
as guests of the Canadian people
for the purpose of building a com
prehensive system of British Em
pire preferential tariffs.
Benentt spoke following Thomas
who had inaugurated the Empire
economic survey. Spokesmen of
other Empire units — Australia,
South Africa, New Foundland, the
Irish Free State, and India—one af
ter another approved the general
principle of the Empire preference.
Thomas today merely invited the
Empire units to give their views
without disclosing what the home
government will do. This is ex
pected to be revealed tomorrow, but
not without the possibility of con
flict within the labor government
ranks if Chancellor Philip Snowden
is urged to surrender his free trade
convictions in favor of the Dominion
views.
The Canadian Premier was em
phatic in declaring that Empire
preference does not mean Empire
free trade.
