# RABBIT'S EAR IS STUDEY'S OBJECT
## Window Enables Scientists To Watch Reaction Of Living Cells 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 8. (/P; â€”
Through a window in a rabbit's ear
scientists are enabled to study the
microscopic details of the growth of
living tissue.
Through its use, says an an
nouncement by the School of Medi
cine of the University of Pennsyl
vania, information regarding the
manner in which abnormal cellular
reactions occur in infectious diseases,
such as tuberculosis, and tumor
growth, such as cancer, will be ob
tainable; the new method opens the
door to enormous advances in
knowledge.
A transparent, double-walled
chamber, or window, is put into a
small hole made in the ear of a
rabbit, like a woman's earring.
One side of this window is of
celluloid or glass, and the other of
a very thin sheet of mica. The edges
of the space intervening are left in
contact with the tissues of the ear
and from them the blood vessels and
other living tissues invade the
chamber until they form a complete
new layer.
