Stanford students must not seal]) I'.ig (iame tickets this vear if
they wish to retain their present ticket privileges for the annual
vridiroii classic. Such is the pronouncement of lake Irwin, direr

Hundreds of complaints from disappointed Stanford and Cali

tickets, thus providing outsiders with admission to the game, which
the alumni were unable to witness.
Regardless of whether the students were to blame or not. the

tlx A.S.S.C. observe the provisions which they agree to when their
iiYket applications are sent in: only in this wav can the students
piotect their ticket rights.
