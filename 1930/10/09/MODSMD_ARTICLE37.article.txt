THE GLORY OF THE NIGHTIN
GALES. By Edwin Arlington
Robinson. Macmillan & Co.
New York. HMO.
So exclusively has the novel
been made 11 narrative in prose that
Arlington's use of blank verge in
the writing of novels is something
of a curiosity. When one considers,
however, the beauties of this form
as used in Elizabethan drama, it
would seem to be a logical form for
the dramatic tale. And any form,
when used as beautifully as Arling
ton's blank verse, needs no justifi
cation.
The story tells of Malory, who
was ruined by the powerful Night
ingale because he had married the
woman whom Nightingale loved.
When the storp opens the woman
lias died and Mayory, after years
of hatred, is traveling to complete
the purpose of his life by killing the
friend who betrayed him.
But he finds Nightingale dying,
friendless, in the midst of his glory,
and his revenge is frustrated. He
stays with Nightingale and talks of
the things which have made both
of them miserable.
The two had been caught in
snares of fate which were not
wholly their own creation. Nightin
gale s;iys,
"And sometime when you ask a
streptococcus
Why it's a streptococcus, you
may learn
All that I know of ;i dead Night
ingale
That will not die."
Malory, for all his hate, admits
that,
"... I cannot know
For certain, that your way,
dark as it was,
Was not the necessary way of
life."
Some of the most beautiful pass
ages of the book show something of
the peace-in-despair to be found in
nature. The waves of the ocean
". . . fall to rise again to the
same end
That was no end, and always

come to nothing."
And Nightingale advises,
. . conserve a thought
Of millions who have never
heard of you
Or me . . . admire
The outside of God's world,
which is pot bad."
"The Glory of the Nightingales"
is artistically well formed. It re
verts to the oldest and most endur
ing of literary ideals and methods.

GOOD NKWS—At the Varsity
Theal re.
Good news! Mars and Venus are
in the same constellation, and Mars
blinks across at Venus, and so Tom
Marlowe (Stanley Smith) passed
the astronomy quiz and won the
game for Tail, which ended in a
: food;; 11 wedding rehearsal, which
ended in a jazz fling, which—well,
which ended!
Bessie Love, Cliff Edwards, and
Stanley Smith, plus several "good
'old son's," plus plenty of wisef.')-
cracks, take the musical comedy
"Good News" and put it on the talk
ing screen. There is little story to it.
The hero, Marlowe, thought he was
important enough to have no pro
posals of marriage taken seriously.
Bui when the "only girl" coaches
i him with the help of Mars and
Venus and the rest of the stars, to
pass the "ex" and play for dear old
Tail, "one of the other girls" pulls
<.ut a written proposal of marriage,
and promises to say "yes" if Mar
lowe wins tlu- game, mean old thing.
But she was only fooling, and
amid a mass of collegians, a foot
ball team of ushers, and brides
maids, Marlowe turns to find the
one he loves being married to him.
"Good News" is the picture that
J those who don't go to college will
! think is "just too collegiate, my
dear." The choruses are filled with
really good music, dancing, and
j costumes. Maybe "dear old Tait"
was supposed to be a musical com
edy training school.
