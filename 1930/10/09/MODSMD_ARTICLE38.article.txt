# CABBAGES and THINGS

Again, may we remark that this
weather is most disconcerting? One
night, the moonlight makes you de
cide that it's going to be a won
derful year. The next morning, it's
raining, and you discover that she's
not nearly so attractive, in "slicker
and galoshes.
As usual, (he best men won
(lie tie-up yesterday. The best
team always wins. (That should
please al least half of our read
ers.)
And to the cither half, we can
preach the gospel that it's .nobler to
lose gracefully than to win with
difficulty. Remaining calm and un
ruffled (Pun!), the graceful losers
are always chosen to pose for news
paper photographers, and have
front-page pictures before the win
ners realize what's going on. And
that's something.
Smallish men have an advantage
in this thrilling sport. The husky
fellows stand oul as targets for
enemy gangs, while smaller ones
are less conspicuous and more pes
tiferous. (That means, they're more
like gnats or mosquitoes, Orville.)
And it goes over wonderfully with
the girl hack home to be able to
write—"l had a little tussle with
seven football players yesterday;
but am feeling fine, except for ;i
few scratches, bruises, and black
eyes."
It's easy to distinguish former
Boy Scouls from (lie res( of (he
mob. Look for (lie man who
hinds you and lies knots scien
tifically. (That should make a
good u<l for something. You
guess what.)
We've thought of a way to avoid
the unnecessary expense and trou
ble of getting rope to tie the vic
tims with. Why doesn't each man
simply donate his shirt and at least
the cuffs of his trousers to the gen
eral cause, before the struggle bo
gins? They're lost sooner or later
in the fray, anyhow. Why not for a
purpose?

girl friends in Singapore and Havana
have less chance of getting to
gether and comparing notes than if
two sorority girl friends live across
the street.
Those women that favor the single
standard, equality of the sexes, and
all that thing should go to the Uni
versity of Kansas where not only
men but co-eds as well pay admis
sion to the campus dances.
The men still get the worst of
the bargain, however, as they
pay .5J.25 while the women for
some unknown reason get by
with 7."i cents.
We have heard higher education
compared to "a staff of success" or
"a fountain of celestial joy" but we
have never heard it compared to "a
squirrel storing nuts" as does the
Pikersville College Weekly.

Personally, we emphatically state
we do not feel the least bit squir
relish.
The U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin states
that an advantage (o college educa
tion is the possibility of rubbing
shoulders with intelligent people.
When wo are caught in a P.O. rush,
intelligent shoulders feel just as
hard as any other kind and are just
as difficult to avoid.
