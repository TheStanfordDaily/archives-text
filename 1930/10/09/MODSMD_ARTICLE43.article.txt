HELL CALIFORNIA!
The Gold is gone from California's
campus today, but the Blue is there
in copious gobs. The Washington
State Cougar raked his claws
through the Bear's hide, scraping
meat and bone, and there remains
but one chance for the Pricemen to
keep their heads above water for
the rest of the season. Beat St.
Mary's!
The Bears and Price ''are on the
spot" right now, and because of
those gentlemen who sell their Big
Game tickets for $5.50, it is a matter
of concern to Stanford that they get
olf said spot in a hurry. A licking
from SI. Mary's will wreck the
California season beyond all hope of
repair. A victory will put them
back in the running, and make the
Hig Game a real one. It will also lie
the signal for the Downtown Coach
es Association to shelve the ham
mers temporarily. For Heaven help
Price if he loses four games this sea
son! And if St. Mary's beats him, it
is practically a cinch that U.S.C.
and Stanford will do likewise—per
haps Washington also.
To be frank, Price will not have
11 Class A eleven until he linds a
pair of tackles. Last year the Bear
tackles were supposed to be the
dough, but Stanford beat them with
reverses right over that spot. This
season, even the 1929 tackles are in
jured or unavailable, which adds
vinegar to the cottage cheese.
On thing California will have in
her favor when she tries to gall the
Gaels and Gauls Saturday. Bodie
Andrews, former St. Mary's line
coach, now occupies that position
for the Bears, and if anyone can, he
can devise a way to blast the Jesuits'
attack. At all events. Stanford will
be not the least of California's root
ers this week-end.
If Phil Moffatt can't find a job
after graduation, he is a cinch to
earn his living as a tight-rope
walker. The Card halfback, in the
last two games, gave as pretty an
exhibition of side-line hugging as
has been seen in many a day.
Against the Olympic Club, "Nifty
Phil" on one play swept around the
Clubmen's left end on a double re
verse. As he reached the line of
scrimmage, he was not more than
two yards from the west side-line,
with the entire Winged O backfield
closing in on him. Yet he raced
down that sideline for 25 yards be
fore he was hit. and in that distance
four tacklcrs had a clean shot at
him and never laid a linger on him.
Against Santa Clara, on that beau
tiful 45-yard punt return, he came
down the center of the field for
nearly .15 yards, then cut straight
for the sideline. It looked as though
lie were going to run out of bounds.
But a yard from the line he
wheeled, pivoted, left a tackier on
his ear, and went the rest of the
way to the goal line a scant three
feet from the outside marker. All
without a single unnecessary mo
tion. Little Sweden is in for an eye
-lul next Saturday, without a doubt.

Against Santa Clara, on that beau
tiful 45-yard punt return, he came
down the center of the field for
nearly .15 yards, then cut straight
for the sideline. It looked as though
lie were going to run out of bounds.
But a yard from the line he
wheeled, pivoted, left a tackier on
his ear, and went the rest of the
way to the goal line a scant three
feet from the outside marker. All
without a single unnecessary mo
tion. Little Sweden is in for an eye
-lul next Saturday, without a doubt.

HELL CALIFORNIA!
The Gold is gone from California's
campus today, but the Blue is there
in copious gobs. The Washington
State Cougar raked his claws
through the Bear's hide, scraping
meat and bone, and there remains
but one chance for the Pricemen to
keep their heads above water for
the rest of the season. Beat St.
Mary's!
The Bears and Price ''are on the
spot" right now, and because of
those gentlemen who sell their Big
Game tickets for $5.50, it is a matter
of concern to Stanford that they get
olf said spot in a hurry. A licking
from SI. Mary's will wreck the
California season beyond all hope of
repair. A victory will put them
back in the running, and make the
Hig Game a real one. It will also lie
the signal for the Downtown Coach
es Association to shelve the ham
mers temporarily. For Heaven help
Price if he loses four games this sea
son! And if St. Mary's beats him, it
is practically a cinch that U.S.C.
and Stanford will do likewise—per
haps Washington also.
To be frank, Price will not have
11 Class A eleven until he linds a
pair of tackles. Last year the Bear
tackles were supposed to be the
dough, but Stanford beat them with
reverses right over that spot. This
season, even the 1929 tackles are in
jured or unavailable, which adds
vinegar to the cottage cheese.
On thing California will have in
her favor when she tries to gall the
Gaels and Gauls Saturday. Bodie
Andrews, former St. Mary's line
coach, now occupies that position
for the Bears, and if anyone can, he
can devise a way to blast the Jesuits'
attack. At all events. Stanford will
be not the least of California's root
ers this week-end.
If Phil Moffatt can't find a job
after graduation, he is a cinch to
earn his living as a tight-rope
walker. The Card halfback, in the
last two games, gave as pretty an
exhibition of side-line hugging as
has been seen in many a day.
Against the Olympic Club, "Nifty
Phil" on one play swept around the
Clubmen's left end on a double re
verse. As he reached the line of
scrimmage, he was not more than
two yards from the west side-line,
with the entire Winged O backfield
closing in on him. Yet he raced
down that sideline for 25 yards be
fore he was hit. and in that distance
four tacklcrs had a clean shot at
him and never laid a linger on him.
