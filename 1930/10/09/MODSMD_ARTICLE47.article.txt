# Bunn Lacks Material For Squad
## NEW CARD COACH DISSATISFIED WITH GASABA TURNOUT Fawcett, Hawkins, Mears Veterans Back; Three Held on Gridiron 
### Stewart Crawford 
With less than half the expected
i turnout on hand for varsity basket
ball, Coach John W. Bunn, the new
1 Card mentor from Kansas, has so
far had little material with which to
begin his teachings on the Farm.
Though Warner is using some of
1 his veteran talent on the gridiron,
Bunn is not satisfied that he has
! enough men to work with satisfac
-1 torily, even at this early date.
Of the 32 athletes working at pres
ent in the Pavilion, Bunn has but
| three lettormen from last year's var
f sity in Fawcett, Mears, and Hawkins.
Of this trio only Fawcett at forward
J appeared regularly in the Redshirt
' starting lineups.
Gridders Help
With the close of lootball season
| the remaining of last year's block
j "S" men who will augment the
strength of Bunn's turnout are
| Doub, Tyler, and Captain Reynolds,
the latter two having been main
| stays of last season s Card defense.
Other possible veteran additions
I who will shed iheir gridiron apparel
i in early winter are Moffatt, Tampke,
! and Rintala. Though out of compe
i tition last year these experienced
j hoopsters were much in evidence in
1 basketball on the Farm two years
| ago. â€¢
Clough, Ray. Loomis, McElwain,
! Fisher, and Weaver, aspirants who
I did not make letters on the varsity
j squad last year, are at present
i working out with Coach Bunn.
Frosh on Hand
Promising talent from the fresh
man squad of last year already on
hand are Mead, Polhamus, Cordry,
and Palmberg. Palmer and Hancock,
who are now working on the gray
' eleven, will be in evidence later on.
Hepp, of tie freshman outfit of two
years ago, has also turned out.
Bunn's plan for perfecting the
free-throwing ability on the Farm
may interest fans who sat in the
stands last season and groaned to
see game after game go slipping be
cause of the Cards' inability in this
department of the game. He is in
stituting a free-throw contest to
begin now and last until the start
of the season. The aspirants for the
squad will be required to attempt
a total of 1000 throws at the rate
of 50 a day. A trophy will be pre
sented to the winner.
Bunn will also handle the fresh
man outfit this year, but with only
10 out at present, he has little with
which to work.
