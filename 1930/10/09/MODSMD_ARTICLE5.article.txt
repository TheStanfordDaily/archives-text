# SOCCER SCHEDULE DECIDED UPON BY C.I.S.C. YESTERDAY
## 
### 
Representatives of three of the
four colleges of the California Inter
collegiate Soccer Conference, com
posed of Stanford. California, San
Jose State, and San Mateo Junior
College, met in the Encina Gymna
sium last night and drew up a
schedule of games for the coming
season. San Jose, San Mateo, and
Stanford were the institutions which
sent men to the meeting.
Four games in this conference
were added to the Stanford schedule
which was previously announced. In
order to avoid conflict with the
games already arranged by the
Cards these conference tilts will be
played in the middle of the week.
Two Games With Each
Each team in the league will play
each of the other teams twice, so
that Stanford has two games sched
uled with both San Mateo and San
Jose. The first two games of the
traditional California-Stanford series
will be counted as the two confer
ence games which the Bears and
Cards would have to play to fill out
the league schedule.
This is California's first year in
the league and is the first year that
Stanford has used its varsity, the
freshmen having played in previous
