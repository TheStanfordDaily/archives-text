# HE SAYS IT WITH A WALLOP..

### Feg Murray, '16 
Many American League managers
lay awake, at night worrying about
the big bat: of Al Simmons, most
talkcd-of player in the younger cir
cuit at this writing, and perhaps
the greatest player in baseball to
day. At any rate, that's what Dan
Hawley, manager of the Cincinnati
Reds, is reported to have called the
Athletic slugger, and many other
smart baseball men have the same
opinion.
Al's debut in the 1930 baseball
season was more than spectacular.
The Philadelphia papers carried
screeching headlines that evening
that told the world "Simmons Hits
Homer First Time Up!" but that
wasn't half the story. Less than two
hours before the game began the
obstinate outfielder was a hold-out
and ineligible to play. As a matter
of fact, the hitting ace had decided
to pack up and go back home to
Milwaukee. An unidentified third
party went into a huddle with Al

| about one o'clock, and then got
Connie on the 'phone and arranged
i one more meeting between the two.
So Simmons taxied over to the
Shibe park (at the club's expense)
and after a few words the document
was signed. The ovation A 1 received
when he appeared on the field in
uniform was equal to the kind usu
ally reserved for a Ruthian homer
in the Yankee stadium. And before
the first inning was over Simmons
i had hit a colossal four-base wallop
as his "thank you" to the fans.
It has been said that the Polish
i outfielder has taken Cobb as his
model, and is in a fair way to equal
Ihe Georgia Peach in everything
that he did in a baseball way. Ex
cept that he bats righthanded, you
might think it was Ty up there at
the plate instead of Al. They have
many of the same mannerisms, and
Al's bat is just as dreaded now by
opposing pitchers as Cobb's ever
j was.
