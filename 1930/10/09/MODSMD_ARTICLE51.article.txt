# FRESHMAN SOCCER SQUAD BEST SINCE '31, SAYS WRIGHT
## Game With Commerce High May Precede Varsity Meet Saturday 
### 
Optimistic opinions about the
class of 34 soccer squad, now in the
process of development, were ex
pressed around the soccer field yes
terday, despite the fact that the
freshmen have a squad of only 22
men and have so far had but two
days of scrimmage.
"A better squad than any since
the class of '31," is the opinion of
Manager Whitney Wright, while
Ward Smith, freshman coach, ad
mitted that the babes look better
than last year's both in quality and
quantity.
First Battle
Commerce High School may send
its soccer team down to the cam
pus Saturday afternoon to meet the
freshmen. If arrangements for the
contest go through it will be played
at 2 o'clock on the soccer field as a
preliminary to the varsity's en
counter with the Hornets, which
is scheduled for 3:30 o'clock. Noth
ing is known of the strength of the
high school team, but it is certain
to have an advantage in that its
members will have played together
before.
Many of the Card babes have
never played soccer before this year
and none of them have had a great
deal of experience in high school.
Nevertheless, they appear to have
the makings of a good eleven, and
j made quite an impression in scrim
mage with the varsity reserves yes
terday and Tuesday.

nounced by Head Coach Harry Ma
loney is as follows: October 11,

"Charley horse." but he will be in
