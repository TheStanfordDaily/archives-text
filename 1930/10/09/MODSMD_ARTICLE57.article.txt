# TWENTY REMAIN ON VARSITY GOLF SQUAD AFTER QUALIFICATION
## McNaughton, Eichelberger, Edmonds Take First Three Positions 
### 
With the qualifying round com
pleted last night, 20 men remain on
Coach Garry Bennett's varsity golf
.squad for the coining season.
McNaughton, with 77, 70-147, led
the field for number one position,
with Harry Eichelbergev in second
place with 75, 74-149, and Warner
Edmonds in third place with 7G,
74-150. McNaughton hails from the
Oswego Country Club of Portland,
having transferred from Reed Col
lege last year. He is well known on
the Pacific slopes, and two years
ago went to the finals in the North
west tourney at Seattle, being de
feated in his last round by Frank
Dolp.
Though ladder ratings retain 20
men on the varsity squad, the first
ten are considered the first string
squad, the remaining ten having the
right to challenge, and playing in
some of the team matches against
country clubs.
A comparison with last year's
qualifying results shows the brand
of golf on the Farm this year to be
of a much higher calibre. The score
of 108 which qualified in twentieth
place was Â«ood enough for eighth
position on last season's Card var
sity.
The complete list of those quali
fying is announced by Bennett as
follows: McNaughton, 147; Eichel
berger, 149; Edmonds, 150; Hell
man, 151; Bill Scott, 157; Stevenson,
158, Rea, 158; Slocum, 159; Hawley,
160 Osmunson, 100; Eberhart, 161;
R. Allen, 163; Johnston, 163; Gold
water, 164; Woodworth, 165; Mac
beth, 160; Corbus, 166; Hoag, 166;
Lewis, 167; Devlin, 168.
Bennett announced that those
who did not qualify are eligible for
intramural team competition, which
they can enter by signing the blanks
available at the gym or the golf
shop.
