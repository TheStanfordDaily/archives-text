# Mackmen Take Worlds Series From St. Louis
## Earnshaw Pitches Tight Ball to Win Sixth Series Game, 7-1 
### 
SHIBE PARK, Philadelphia, Oct.
(Associated Press). —The great
right arm of George Livingston
Earnshaw and the dynamite in the
bats of his team mates, exploding
with devastating effect all over the
premises, today swept the Phila
delphia Athletics to their second
successive world's championship and
their fifth of all time under the
leadership of Connie Mack.
While the 67-year-old patriarch of
baseball sat serene and quiet on the
bench, in solitary dignity among a
flock of wildly excited ball players,
the Athletics put on a power-plus
exhibition of baseball to rout the
St. Louis Cardinals, 7 to 1, in the
sixth game of the world's series.
4 Games to 2
The victory gave the Athletics the
series by a margin of four games to
two as they forced their previous
conqueror, Wild Bill Hallahan, from
the box after two innings and ham
mered three of the four Cardinal
pitchers for seven smashing hits.
On the same field where they
made five extra base drives account
for as many runs in the opening
game rout of Burleigh Grimes, the
Athletics today collected five
doubles and two home runs, one by
A 1 Simmons and thp other by Jim
my Dykes, to roll up a total of 18
bases —and seven runs.
Staggering back from the terrific
force of this high explosive bom
bardment., the Cardinals were sub
dued for the second straight game
by the fast ball pictching of Earn
shaw, who blanked them for eight
successive innings as he completed
one of the greatest pitching exhibi
tions in world's series history.
Earnshaw Conquers
With only a day's travel from St.
Louis to Philadelphia for rest, Earn
shaw returned to the mound and
mastered the National League
Champions with the same skill and
effectiveness he showed in whipping
them in the second game here and in
holding them scoreless for seven
straight innings of the crucial fifth
game at St. Louis Monday after
noon.
Only the fact that he was with
drawn for a pinch hitter in the fifth
game, which Robert Moses Grove
finished and received official credit
for winning, prevented Earnshaw
from scoring three victories and
placing his name in the hall of fame
that already lists Christy Mathew
son, Jack Coombs, Red Faber, Babe
Adams and Stanley Coveleskie.

Earnshaw Conquers
With only a day's travel from St.
Louis to Philadelphia for rest, Earn
shaw returned to the mound and
mastered the National League
Champions with the same skill and
effectiveness he showed in whipping
them in the second game here and in
holding them scoreless for seven
straight innings of the crucial fifth
game at St. Louis Monday after
noon.
Only the fact that he was with
drawn for a pinch hitter in the fifth
game, which Robert Moses Grove
finished and received official credit
for winning, prevented Earnshaw
from scoring three victories and
placing his name in the hall of fame
that already lists Christy Mathew
son, Jack Coombs, Red Faber, Babe
Adams and Stanley Coveleskie.
SHIBE PARK, Philadelphia, Oct.
(Associated Press). —The great
right arm of George Livingston
Earnshaw and the dynamite in the
bats of his team mates, exploding
with devastating effect all over the
premises, today swept the Phila
delphia Athletics to their second
successive world's championship and
their fifth of all time under the
leadership of Connie Mack.
While the 67-year-old patriarch of
baseball sat serene and quiet on the
bench, in solitary dignity among a
flock of wildly excited ball players,
the Athletics put on a power-plus
exhibition of baseball to rout the
St. Louis Cardinals, 7 to 1, in the
sixth game of the world's series.
4 Games to 2
The victory gave the Athletics the
series by a margin of four games to
two as they forced their previous
conqueror, Wild Bill Hallahan, from
the box after two innings and ham
mered three of the four Cardinal
pitchers for seven smashing hits.
On the same field where they
made five extra base drives account
for as many runs in the opening
game rout of Burleigh Grimes, the
Athletics today collected five
doubles and two home runs, one by
A 1 Simmons and thp other by Jim
my Dykes, to roll up a total of 18
bases —and seven runs.
Staggering back from the terrific
force of this high explosive bom
bardment., the Cardinals were sub
dued for the second straight game
by the fast ball pictching of Earn
shaw, who blanked them for eight
successive innings as he completed
one of the greatest pitching exhibi
tions in world's series history.
