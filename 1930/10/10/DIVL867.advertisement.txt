When we say that CASTLEROCK is a "new and finer"
7 I
type of clothes, we mean just that . . . We mean that
CASTLEROCK CLOTHES are the result of three years of
4>-
careful planning and merchandising . . . We mean that
CASTLEROCK CLOTHES offer a quality of fabric, a fine
ness of tailoring, a nicety of style, that has not been
possible heretofore at prices within the average man's
income . . . and especially the younger man's income
. . . We mean that Nine-Store-Buying-Power has accom
plished something distinctly new and distinctly worth while
to the man of moderate means, who likes to dress well.
