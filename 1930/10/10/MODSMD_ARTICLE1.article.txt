# MEDICS DECIDE PARALYSIS NOT CAMPUS THREAT
## Patty Baker Resting Easy In San Francisco Hospital NO CAUSE FOR ALARM 
### 
While one Stanford student lies
stricken in a drinker respirator in
a San Francisco hospital and an
other is under observation in a local
infirmary, medical authorities last
night united in declaring there is
no further danger from infantile
paralysis on the camous.
With both her arms paralyzed,
Patty Baker was reported as resting
comfortably in the only drinker res
pirator located in the entire Far
West.
Duniway Recuperates
At the same time, David Duniway
was declared to be recuperating
from a suspected case of poliomyeli
tis.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, University
health officer and men's medical ad
viser, advised all members of the
local community not to feel alarmed
about the present situation. That
adequate care is being taken was
his reassurance.
He explained the two eases of
poliomyelitis probably originated in
southern California where a large
number of cases were prevalent
during the summer.
Sick Should Report
The Stanford campus was declared
by the Stanford medical officer to
be as free from the disease as is
possible. He said it was one of the
safest and best protected communi
ties in California against polomyeli
tis.
All students who feel sick are re
el uested by Dr. Storey to report to
either the men's or women's medi
cyi services. Hours for examination
arc 9 to 12 o'clock in the morning
and 1 to 5:30 o'clock in the after
noon and from 9 to 12 o'clock on
Saturdays.
