HARBOR GRACE, N.F., Oct. 9.
(Associated Press) —Another trans
atlantic flight was under way to
night. Two men who have never
made the voyage were winging their
way to England in the tried and
true Columbia, which flew the
ocean three years ago.
Capt. Erroll Boyd, first Canadian
to enlist in the Royal Flying Corps
in the World War, and Harry P.
Connor, former lieutenant in the
United States Navy, took off for
London at 11:30 o'clock E.S.T. Fifty
minutes later the Columbia, in
which Clarence Chamberlin and
Charles A. Levine flew from New
York to German in 1927, flashed
over St. Johns and was on her
eastward course to added fame.
At 12:55 she was seen flying only
200 icet above the water by the
crew of the steamer Quaker City,
100 miles east northeast of Cape
Race. Hours of silence followed, but
this was easily explained by fog
which lay over much of the North
Atlantic and which would have hid
den the plane from ships unless she
passed very close.
