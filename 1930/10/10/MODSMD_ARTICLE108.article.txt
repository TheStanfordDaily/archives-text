### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 9. (Associated
Press) â€”Ten $1,000 bills tendered as
bond lor Radph Capone were re
jected by Judge John H. Lyle today
and the senior member of the quar
tet of Capone brothers was tossed
in a ccll to await a going over at
the pleasure of police interrogators.
"Treat him like any common
criminal," was the court's parting
command as he delivered Capone to
a sergeant from the bureau of iden
tification.
So No. 9 of the roster of "public
enemies" went to the finger-print
bureau and the police lockup.
Sought on a vagrancy warrant for
some time, he had awaited the de
posit of bond and its acceptance by
a municipal court clerk last night
before surrendering.
