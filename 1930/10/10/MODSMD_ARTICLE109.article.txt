# FINNY DENIZENS TO HAVE BIG COCKTAIL PARTY WITH DEATH
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 9 (Associated
Press). â€”The granddaddy of all
cocktails is to be shaken up here
shortly but nobody'll be on band to
drink it but some fish, and they're
going to end their drinking days at
the very moment the alcoholic dish
is served.
The cocktail will be composed of
141 Paris (meaning bottles) of cham
pagne, 71; of various other wines,
169; of liquers, 159; of whisky, !0(i;
of gin, G3; of rum, ;>O4: of beer, 2G9;
of ale, and 184 of stout.
It's all part of the cargo of the
Bermuda liner, Fort Victoria, which
sank at the entrance to Ambrose
Channel after a collision last year,
which is to be dynamited within the
next few days.
Even now the dynamite, 25 tons of
it, is aboard the little two masted
schooner, Annie May, of Bowers,
Del., which is anchored in a cove
on the nearby Jersey coast, awaiting
only favorable weather.
The explosive is special stuff, 75
per cent nitroglycerine and so vola
tile that the contractor did not dare
to bring it here by train. Stowed in
100 pound bags which will be sewed
four feet apart into a great net, it
will be laid, oh so gently, beside the
Fort Victoria.
The theory is that when a switch
is pulled the explosion will dig a
hole in the sand ol the sea bottom
and topple the Fort Victoria into a
new made grave.
