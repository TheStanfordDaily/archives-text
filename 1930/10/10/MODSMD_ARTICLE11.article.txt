# QUIZ DISCLOSES WOMEN DESIRE LEISURE TIME
## Five Hundred Would Like To Spend More Time In Hard Study 
### Catherine Spaulding 
i Stanford women would like to
j spend more time sleeping, more
j time on cultural events, on activi
] ties, on sports, dancing, and shows.
I They are not satisfied with the way
j they spend their time. Such were
the facts obtained from the time
j study made at the end of last spring
| quarter under the auspices of the
1 Y.W.C.A. and announced last night.
Questionnaires which were sent
j to all the women revealed that the
I majority felt the lack of leisure
| time, and took time from sleep and
i study rather than from activities to
! make it.
The five-hundred would also like
I to spend more time studying—by a
i very slight majority—and do not
! consider time spent on dancing and
I shows a waste.
No Over-Organization
i The purpose of the time schedule
was partially to determine whether
I or not there was over-organization
: on the campus among the women.
\ When asked to answer individually,
! a large majority declared that as far
as they were concerned there was
j not over-organization, indicating to
j the committee that campus activities
| were held by a small gi'oup of
! women.
j The majority admitted that they
' had no time for reading other than
I that required by courses and that
they had no time to keep up with
| world events through current pub
| lications.
Asked whether they spent time
| eating between meals at the cellar
i or creamery, a slight majority said
they did.
Few I'se Budget
A small minority said that they
budgeted their time definitely but
a large minority thought such a
system valuable and although the
campus life may be hurried and
wasteful most of the women said
that it was the kind that they
wanted.
In connection with the time ques
tionnaires, individual study charts
were kept for a total of ninety-nine
weeks. Announcements concerning
the results obtained from this study
are to be made soon.
Stanford worked in conjunction
with California, U.C.L.A., and Red
lands on this time question which
was started here under the auspices
of the Y.W.C.A. Eastern colleges
have in the past undertaken similar
i studies, but this year is the first
time interest has been aroused in
the West.
