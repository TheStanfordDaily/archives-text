WASHINGTON, Oct. 9. (Associ
atcd Press) â€”Customs officials an
nounced today that a shipment of
safety matches from Russia had
been assessed an additional ten per
cent duty because the markings on
the boxes were so illegible they did
not show the country of origin.
Complaints against the shipment
were made by the Swedish Cham
ber of Commerce of the United
States. Customs officials said the
law provided that when the marks
on imported goods were illegible
they should be held up and an ad
ditional ten per cent duty levied.
The duty on Russian matches re
cently was increased 50 per cent
through executive order when it
was found they were being sold in
Ihe United States at less than the
sale price in Russia.
