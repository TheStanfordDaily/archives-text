# ENROLLMENT IN AMERICAN COLLEGES SHOWS INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR
## 
### 
Coincident with the increase in
registration, as announced yesterday
jn the final report from the office
of the Registrar, a survey of Ameri
can colleges shows that the majority
have 'in increase in enrollment over
last year's figures.
One of the largest increases re
corded is that, of the University of
Minnesota. There the gain was 499
students, making a grand total of
11,22fi. Only four colleges report a
decrease; the two Mississippi col
leges report a very slight drop, but
at Indiana there are 187 students
less than last year, and at Illinois,
545.
Reynolds' Theory
The theory advanced by Professor
C. N. Reynolds .acting head of the
Economics department here, offers
business depression as a possible
explanation for the increased en
i ollment.
"There is always a marginal
group of young people," says Rey
nolds, "who will go to a university
it conditions are favorable to that,

or will enter business if at the time
it seems the most desirable.
"When depression is prevalent
and jobs are scarce these young men
and women decide upon a longer
preliminary investment. Moreover,
in the scarcity of opportunity, par
ents have come to realize that train
ing is necessary for success.
Students Work
"On the other hand, there is an
other group of students financially
dependent on themselves whose
continuance depends on earninig
during the summer and often dur
ing the academic year and this
group suffers. However, business
men are always willing to give these
college students a boost whenever
possible. Although many employ
ment bureaus maintained at the in
stitutions alleviate their condition
with odd-job employment.
"In general, equilibrium between
the two bodies of students is greatly
affected by the condition of general
business. Apparently universities
gain more by business depression
and enrollment is greater.
