# HEMPEN CURE FOR "CRICKS" IN NECK IS ALMOST FATAL
## 
### 
CUTHBERT, Ga., Oct. !) (TP)—The
rope cure for cricks in the ncck will
not be used again by its inventor,
John Emanuel, railroad crew fore
man, he announced today from his
hospital cot.
Subject to cricks, Emanuel has
long employed a therapeutic method
just short of hanging. He used a
rope attached to his neck and the
ceiling just a little longer than
would produce strangulation or
fracture, but still short enough to
give the ncck a crick-cracking perk.
This week he overestimated the
length of the rope—and when lie
jumped he found himself suspended
with pawing toes. His wife had him
removed to a hospital unconscious.
