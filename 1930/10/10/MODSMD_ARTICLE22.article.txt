NANKING, Oct. 9. (/P) â€” With
Chengchow, Honan province and
rebel stronghold captured by gov
ernment troops and insurgents re
treating westward and northward,
startling reports came tonight that
government and rebellious leaders
were planning to confer for China
wide rehabilitation.
Official circles declined to com
ment upon these reports. Among
them was a Chinese press dispatch
from Peiping stating President
Chiang Kai-shek, despite numerous
utterances to the contrary, had
agreed with rebel leader Feng Yu
hsiang to meet Chang Hsuch-liang,
Manchurian dictator, at Peiping,
soon to discuss reconstruction meas
ures.
