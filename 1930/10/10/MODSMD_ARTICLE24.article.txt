# Stanford Eleven Set For Contest With Minnesota
## CRISLERMEN HOLD PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE Minnesota Will Be Fighting Hard to Redeem Crushing Vanderbilt Defeat; Warner Needs Win Over Tough Eleven to Put Cards on Edge 
### BY LEN KUI. LMANN 
RUNNING for Gophers tomorrow in Minneapolis, Glenn Scobey Warner
will not bo using a small gauge gun when the hostilities begin. "Pop"
will probably start his strongest lineup for the first time this season
against Minnesota, while Coach Fritz Crisler of the Purple and Gold in
tends to throw his aces into the conflict in the hope that his cohorts can
surprise the invaders.
Stanford will probably take the field with a line composed of No ill and
Doub, ends; Bogue and Ehrhorn, tackles; Dawson and Hand, guards:

and Taylor, center. Hillman, MoiTatt,
Clark, and Rothert are expected to
comprise the backfield.
While all and sundry have tabbed
the Gophers as small game, too
often the underdog has secured a
sizeable part of the favored foes'
anatomy before the aforementioned
foe has awakened from his lethargy.
Santa Clara's two wins from the
Redshirts prove that nothing is im
possible, so it will behoove the
Warnermen to beware of the prairie
dogs.
Inspired by their coach, aroused
by the crushing defeat inflicted upon
them by Vanderbilt, and fighting
for the reputation which Minnesota
teams have built up in the past,
Crisler's crew will be waging a ter
rific battle tomorrow. A team given
little chance to win, although recog
nized as possessing power, is always
dangerous; Minnesota will have all
these attributes plus the will to
triumph.
Before the squad departed. Tues
day, Warner intimated that the 1930
version of the Big Red Machine
might be thrown into high gear by
a hotly contested clash. To use the
Card mentor's own words, the boys
have the makings of a great ball
club; how great they will be depends
upon their showing in a tough game.
Minnesota may be lhat "tough
game" the Redshirts need beneath
their belts.
Playing on a foreign field, watched
by a hostile crowd, and confronted
by an inspired team, the Stanford
varsity may be tried to its utmost.
Should such a close contest develop,
few laurel wreaths will crown the
Cards, but the Warnermen will have
been welded into a unit for the
games to come.
Returning from the trip to New
Scandinavia, Oregdn State will greet
the Cards in the Stadium a week
from tomorrow. And after the men
of Schissler depart, that Cardinal
and Gold menace which spells
Southern California, will be just
around the corner.
Besides battling the Minnesotan...
Warner must hope that his squad
comes through the encounter com
paratively unscathed. Oregon State
spells plenty of trouble, for the
Cards will have but three days of
pi'actice before that clash. The in
jured list, with Caglieri unable to
make the trip to Minnesota, Tandy
unable to play, Heiser's condition
doubtful, Bardin's ankle still an un
known quality, is entirely too im
posing already.
The Stanford student body will be
forced to content itself with the
radio version of the game. KFRC
in San Francisco has made arrange
ments to put the Card-Gopher game
on air, and the broadcast is sched
uled to begin around 12 o'clock to -
morrow noon.
