## 
### 
In welcoming the new students at the assembly last week it was
uggested that the new members <>t the A.S.S.I . get their money s
worth while at Stanford. At the same assembly it was proposed
lliat the new students, when looking about for friends, extend their
search to the ranks of the faculty.
Why shouldn't every student combine these two ideas into the
one of getting as much of his money's worth as possible out of the
I'nivcrsity by enjoying Stanford's faculty members both as friends
and as teachers?
There is much that faculty members can give to students by
their friendship, and in most cases they arc glad to give it. A pro
fessor has a far more mature outlook on life than the average stu
dent ; in addition, he is a scholar and often an authority in his
chosen field. He can advise and inform and instruct, but not as
he does these things in the classroom. Minus his classroom man
ner, he can talk as a friend and entertain as a companion, not as a
lecture platform pedagogue.
l ; acultv friendships cultivated during his undergraduate years
some day may cause a graduating student to write "value received"
on the manv checks he made payable to Stanford I niversity.
