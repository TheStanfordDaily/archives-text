HOLIDAY—at the Stanford Theatre
Saturday only.
Ann Harding gives one of the best
screen performances of the year in
this adaptation of J. M. Barrie's play.
As Linda, one of staid old family
glittering with success and riches,
Ishe seeks some escape to more hu
man fields, and finds it by falling
in love with her sister's fiance, a
young idealist, played by Robert
Ames.
Mary Astor, the beautiful sister,
whose only interest is in the per
fection of the details ol' her own life,
and Edward Owsley, the brother
who finds solace in goblets, share
honors with Edward Everett lior
ton, giving good and witty lines.
All in all it is an excellent eve
ning's entertainment.

CAKES AND ALE. By Somerset
Maugham. Doubleday Doran.
New York 1!):»(). At (he Palo
Alio Bookstore.
Somerset Maugham with his bit
ing sarasm and sympathetic irony
is with us iigain! His latest book,
Cakes and Ale: or the Skeleton in
the Cupboard, is highly amusing,
beautifully written and never a dis
appointment.
Maugham presents the story of
Driffield, "grand old man of English
letters," in an original way. Written
in the first person, the book is a
curious mixture of childhood remi
niscences and present time happen
ings. Maugham tells us of Rosie, the
barmaid, Driffield's first wife, as he
knew her when she was "like the
sun shining silver" and he was a
young student. Then he jumps to
the current period and describes his
meeting with Driffield's second wife
and widow, a shrewd woman who
gave fame to her husband but never
happiness.
Maugham has cleverly inter
woven his story with many of his
own personal notions. He talks of
his concept of beauty and ends by

saying that beauty is a bore. He
heaps ridicule on the English peer
age, and insults the writing profes
sion with effusive praise.
Cakes and Ale is a masterpiece in
construction, written in an easy,
fluent style, beautiful but never
pedantic, and always fascinating.

PAUL ROBESON, NEGRO. By Es
landa Goode Robeson. Harper
and Brothers. $2.50.
Here is the simple statement of
the wife of a great man. Unadorned,
straightforward, it will never be
classed as literature but it is an ex
cellent study of Robeson. It is a col
lection of press clippings hung over
a biography with a sermon on race
prejudice and a vocal lesson thrown
in for good measure.
Only once does the book touch
the artistic in its wording. The chap
ter on the two Pauls, father and
son, has some beautiful spark of
that indefinable thing that makes a
Van Vechten readable.
Robeson is certainly a most un
usual man. A Phi Beta Kappa and
one of the four men "most truly
and fully representing the finest
ideals and traditions of Rutgers,"
he is also an athlete of fame. Walter
Camp chose him as end for his 1919
Ail-American team and when he
graduated twelve blocks were his.
Later as an actor he won praise in
O'Neill's "Emperor Jones" and "All
God's Chillun Got Wings," and as
Shakespeare's "Othello.'
It is, however, as singer that Stan
ford will hear him early next year.
His triumphs in this field are well
known. Of a relatively minor posi
tion in the cast of Show Boat he
made a lead. In concert he has
toured the United States and Eurone.
The book is recommended as the
unusual view of a genius. It does not
need power of word; the achieve
ments of its protagonist are enough
to absorb one completely.
