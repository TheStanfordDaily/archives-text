# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
An unusual number of visitors !
have been cluttering up the campus
during the past week. The novelty
of wondering what Hoover's home
looks like has nearly worn itself
out. This year, they're admiring the
beautiful flowers, brown grass, and i
bandaged athletes.
Just yesterday, an Eastern
man on bis first visit to Cali
fornia, was being shown every
thing worth looking at. He si
lently accepted it all, until he
saw two especially bulbous
looking date palms on a lawn.
Then he exploded. "The rest
may be true, but you can't tell
me that pineapples grow that
large ..."
In our daily search for—(what is
it well-meaning students search '
for?)— Anyhow, we were walking
by the window of the Cellar kitchen
and heard a tenor voice singing the
chorus to Kreisler's "Kiss Me," ;
punctuated by the sputtering of j
grease in the frying pan.
It seems that the man who fries i
your daily bacon and eggs has a i
soul and a favorite song. The song
comes out the window. You'll see (
his soul shining in the eggs, if you ;
take 'em sunny-side-up. (Hope
you've already had breakfast, this
morning.) t

Do you ever wonder what mar
tyred soul is responsible for the
sugary names for fountain specials?
"Scotch Lassie" and "Ant-Hill" got
by fairly well, and "Normal Girl"
gives you something to ponder over
(everyone knows there aren't any
normal girls).
But when you've eaten what they
call a "Lovers' Delight," you'll have
learned that it never pays to be
lieve in signs. They say that love
is like that —maybe they really don't
notice things like names. Oh, ah,
hum . . . (that represents a sigh).
There may be a business depres
sion going on in the world outside,
but there have never been so many
new cars on this campus, at one
time. And of course we aren't
counting the Austins.
What with fall quarter men's
rushing of transfer students, and
women being allowed to roam at
large till 2:30 o'clock on week
end mornings, this place is get
ting to be uist like any other
modern university.
We're told that a campus man is
suing a friend who tripped him.
causing him to break three fingers.
. . . An expensive trip, even if the
man didn't go far ....

lieve in signs. They say that love
is like that —maybe they really don't
notice things like names. Oh, ah,
hum . . . (that represents a sigh).
There may be a business depres
sion going on in the world outside,
but there have never been so many
new cars on this campus, at one
time. And of course we aren't
counting the Austins.
What with fall quarter men's
rushing of transfer students, and
women being allowed to roam at
large till 2:30 o'clock on week
end mornings, this place is get
ting to be uist like any other
modern university.
We're told that a campus man is
suing a friend who tripped him.
causing him to break three fingers.
. . . An expensive trip, even if the
man didn't go far ....
An unusual number of visitors !
have been cluttering up the campus
during the past week. The novelty
of wondering what Hoover's home
looks like has nearly worn itself
out. This year, they're admiring the
beautiful flowers, brown grass, and i
bandaged athletes.
Just yesterday, an Eastern
man on bis first visit to Cali
fornia, was being shown every
thing worth looking at. He si
lently accepted it all, until he
saw two especially bulbous
looking date palms on a lawn.
Then he exploded. "The rest
may be true, but you can't tell
me that pineapples grow that
large ..."
In our daily search for—(what is
it well-meaning students search '
for?)— Anyhow, we were walking
by the window of the Cellar kitchen
and heard a tenor voice singing the
chorus to Kreisler's "Kiss Me," ;
punctuated by the sputtering of j
grease in the frying pan.
It seems that the man who fries i
your daily bacon and eggs has a i
soul and a favorite song. The song
comes out the window. You'll see (
his soul shining in the eggs, if you ;
take 'em sunny-side-up. (Hope
you've already had breakfast, this
morning.) t

Do you ever wonder what mar
tyred soul is responsible for the
sugary names for fountain specials?
"Scotch Lassie" and "Ant-Hill" got
by fairly well, and "Normal Girl"
gives you something to ponder over
(everyone knows there aren't any
normal girls).
But when you've eaten what they
call a "Lovers' Delight," you'll have
learned that it never pays to be
lieve in signs. They say that love
is like that —maybe they really don't
notice things like names. Oh, ah,
hum . . . (that represents a sigh).
