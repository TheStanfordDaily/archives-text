The Editor, Sir:
"A Rickcty Breakfast" —a tragedy
in one act.
Scene: The cellar.
Time: Breakfast time, Tuesday,
October 7.
A prospective customer in quest
of a breakfast seats himself at the
counter. It is 7:40 a.m.
7:48 a.m.: His presence is officially
acknowledged by a glass of water
and a semi-expectant fact. "Coffee
and a small buttered snail, please."
7:51 a.m.: A small glass of frozen
orange arrives and is placed at the
disposal of the customer, who, how
ever, feels that he would prefer the
coffee and snail and sends it back,
reiterating the order.
7:53 a.m.: A large snail, cut and
buttered, ultimately appears, after
almost being misled off its path. In
suppressed disgust, and because it
was getting late, the customer ac-

cepts the large snail, and begins to
nibble it pending the coffee.
7:55 a.m. "Hey! Where's that cof
i fee?"
7:56 a.m.: One (1) cup of Deluxe
Union Cellar col Tee arrives safely.
8:01 a.m.: "My check, please?"
So the patron was finally re
warded with the check, paid the
i neat sum of 20c for grub and serv
| ice (and polished nickel fittings)
and left for class, a satisfied cus
tomer.
The Customer.
The Editor, Sir:
I wish it were made a practice in
the Stanford Daily, as in some other
publications, to have the cost of the
| book or theatrical performance pub
lished together with the place where
j the book may be purchased or the
show seen (Palo Alto movies omit
ted). —H. M. D.
