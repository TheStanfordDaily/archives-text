It is no wonder that a class in
"Emotions in Modern Life" at
U.S.C. was over-filled at its first
meeting. There are so many emo
tions we would like analyzed such
as our feeling when we see a pol
lished, sophisticated-appearing co
ed chewing gum on the quad.
After all this drab and mor
bid philosophy of the present
age, it is with the cheerful wel
come of the spring robin that
we read in the Mills Weekly
that, "We now have the cour
age to admit that we believe in
beauty, that we see value in the
wholesome virtues."
In other words, the students of
Mills imply thai they appreciate
their own looks and believe that
their ideas are O.K.
The University of Illinois chapter
of Pi Beta Phi leads in the "Siren
Contest." No, the "Siren Contest" is
not a female personality race. It is
simply the title of the local humor
magazine.
At U.C.L.A. there is the very
active custom of kidnapping the
frosh president while at Stan
ford it seems that the idea is to
make him a member of a "back
to nature" cull—that is judging
from the recent "Soph Raid."
A pair of pajamas are to be given
sway at California as a prize for
campus song-writers. We wonder if
the pajamas are symbolic of the de
sire for a slow, dreamy, sleepy tune
—indicative of California's lethargic
football hopes.
The Bachelor Society of U.S.C.
is sponsoring a "Hello and
Smile" week. Here at Stanford
we hello and smile the whole
year—"Hello" for the roughs
and smiles for the co-eds.
At our we can buy
everything from toothbrushes to
typewriters; but at Washington
State, the bookstore, besides supply
ing college necessities, is a great
campus dating center. Perhaps the
Cougars do not have such an ac
commodating library as the more
fortunate Cards.
