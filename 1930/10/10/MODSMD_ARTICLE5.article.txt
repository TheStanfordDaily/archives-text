# DITCH TO DEFEND ROBLE SIX WEEKS
## 
### 
Roble maidens must continue
to trip daintily over yawning
trenches and three-foot em
bankments on their way to the
Quad for another six weeks at
least.
According to Roy Button,
superintendent of buildings and
grounds, the work on the new
water mains on Santa Theresa
street will not be completed
until about December 1. But
ton states that the work will
cease temporarily, until a
trench-digging machine is put
into operation on the project.
