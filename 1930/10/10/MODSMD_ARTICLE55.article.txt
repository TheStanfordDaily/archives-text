Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will hold a rehearsal of the
sopranos and tenors of the oratorio
chorus Monday night at 8 o'clock in
Room 84.
The oratorio work will consist of
i training in Brahm's "Requiem," con-
I sidered a masterpiece of choral
| music, to be sung in the Memorial
Church with a full orchestra the
I night of November 11, Armistice
Day. More voices are needed to take
the place of students who graduated
last year and of those who are not
registered this quarter. All men
and women with singing experience
who can come to the twelve re
hearsals may apply for membership.
The rehearsals will be held approxi
j mately three times a week.
Oratorio credit will be granted for
the twelve hour's work ending No
vember 11. Membership in the Uni
versity choir is not a requirement
for oratorio, but students passing the
| voice test are encouraged to register
i for both.
