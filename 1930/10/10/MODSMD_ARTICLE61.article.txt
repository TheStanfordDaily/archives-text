FOP WARNER, PROPHET
Joini lg the ranks of the great ma
jority, Glenn Scobey Warner picked
Saint Mary's to take "Nibs" Price's
Golden Bears into camp tomorrow.
Warner, speaking over a bay region
radio s ation the other night through
the medium of a phonograph rec
ord, named his favorites in most of
the gridiron contests of the country
tomorrow.
"Pop" favored the Trojans
over the Cougars, although he
admitted that Ilollingbery's boys
would probably show Southern
California an entertaining after
noon before the final figures of
the game were ready for publi
cation. As far as Stanford is
concerned, the Trojans must
win or Washington Slate cannot
be stopped in her drive toward
the Conference crown.
:o:
The Cardinal mentor refused to
commit himself on the Stanford-
Minnesota game. That he fears
over-confidence on the part of the
Redshirts is self-evident, and the
fact that Stanford has nothing to
j uin and everything to lose tomor
row will not cheer Warner up. Un
less the Cards come through in a
convincing manner, the Middle West
will be little impressed.
When Vanderbilt knocked off the
Gophers, they put Stanford in a hole.
Very little rredil will come Warner's
way for winning from a team al
ready branded as the weak sister of
the Big Ten. Given absolutely no
chance at all to win, the New
Scandinavians can hardly disappoint
their supporters, but they may sur
prise them.
After pulling the stock foot
ball story about the man at the
bottom of the heap biting his
own leg, Warner cracked the
best joke in years—if you have
not heard it before—via the
ether waves.
It seems that two Catholic institu
tions were playing back east one
day, and the game was being ref
erred by Bob Maxwell. During the
course of the contest, which was
being hotly fought since the schools
were deadly rivals, the play began
to get a trifle rough. Maxwell was
watching the work of the .men
closely, but he saw no illegal play.
Suddenly, after a particularly
vicious line buck, one oi the
players dashed over to Maxwell
and exhibited a bleeding ear.
The injured boy claimed that he
had been bitten, and an exam
ination of the organ bore out
the contention. Maxwell, not
having seen the foul, was forced
In wave the lad back to his posi
tion.
Several plays later a member of
the opposing team rushed over to
the referee, and this time Maxwell
was shown a thumb, teeth-marks
being plainly printed upon it. Un
fortunately Maxwell had not wit
nessed this bit of mayhem either.
Becoming quite ired by this type of
play, Maxwell called both teams to
gether and delivered a hot lecture
to them.
Carried away by his wrath.
Maxwell concluded with: "And
the next time you fellows play,
you'd better have the game
scheduled on a Friday."
