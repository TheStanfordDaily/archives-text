# Larger Cardinal, Cal. Tennis Squads Predicted
## VARSITY COACHES PLAN FOR LONGER SERIES OF GAMES Expect Tournament Change To Give More Players First Team Chance

. "California and Stanford tennis
teams may be larger this year than
heretofore," according to Frank
Ragan, varsity tennis coach.
â–  Until this year the teams have
played but three singles matches
and two doubles matches in their
tournaments. This.year the coaches
of the two institutions think it prob-
I able that the tournaments will con
sist of six singles and three doubles
matches, thereby making it pos
sible for more men to make Ihe
1 teams.
With Captain Keith Gledhill lead
ing a 35-man squad of great poten
tialities the Cardinals appear well
equipped to have a successful year.
The larger number of men likely to
play in the U.C. matches augments
the likelihood of a Stanford victory.
"Gledhill should be very good this
year and will no doubt be mentioned
for the Davis Cup playoffs," Ragan
said.
"Competition should be quite stiff
between Captain Easton, Harry Ply
mire, and Joe Coughlin, sophomore
player, who was mainstay of last
year's frosh team and is one of the
four ranking junior players in the
state. I expect this keen rivalry to
i develop these men considerably,"
the coach declared.
Easton and Plymire played in the
East this summer with success and
I gained some valuable competitive
experience.
"Tennis fans will be able to see
J members of the squad in action
within three or four weeks, at which
time the exhibition matches for the
quarter will begin," Ragan prom
ised. "These will probably be held
once a week as they were last year."
j The varsity courts have been
I treated with a green chalk comoo
-1 sition which reduces eye strain on
the men.
According to Ragan the frosh
squad of 35 is the largest he has
ever had. Otis, of Pasadena, frosh
player, is especially good and is
well known in the South.
Weeding out of the squads will
begin in four or five weeks.
