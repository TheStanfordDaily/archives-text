defeat handed them by a sensational
Vanderbilt eleven here last Satur
day, the Gophers still give promise
of developing into a strong team be
fore the season comes to a close.
The success of the Crisler system
of play demands fast moving and
1 active thinking backs, who can both
toss and receive passes. Of this type
Crisler has several, but most of j
them are men of little experience.
Two Veterans to Start
Captain Win Brockmeyer, quarter
back, serving his third year as a
Gopher, is the oldest of the local
i backs who will take the field Sat
urday. Clint Reibeith of the twist
ing hips and elusive side step who
I last year ranked as one of the out
standing backs in the Big 10 will be
the only other veteran likely to
start in the backfield. The other
! two positions will be filled from
among the newcomers, chief of
whom are "Pee Wee" McDougal,
sensational 140 pound sophomore,
Jack Manders 200 pound sophomore â€¢
fullback, who is being groomed to
fill Bronco Nagurski's shoes, Sam
Swartz, a sophomore find, Russ Lek
sell who saw some service last year
at full back, Walter and Johnny
Hass, brothers who are among the
i fastest on the squad, and Paul Kirk
and Red Sommers from last year's ;
reserves.
Heavy Lineman
Of the linemen, Munn, a 220-
pound tackle, Harold Anderson and
Royal Hoefler, ends, Bob Reihsen and
Elmer Apphan, guards, and Gross, a
reserve tackle, are the only men of
any previous Varsity experience. 1
Clarence Munn besides being one of
1 the mainstays of the line has been
doing the punting for Crisler this
, year and in the first two games his '

booting has been nothing short of
sensational.
Boland, a 200-pound tackle, Berry,
a reserve tackle of last year, A1
Krezowski, a lanky end and Lloyd
Stein, regular center, are the new
comers who have shown impres
sively and will see considerable
service Saturday.
