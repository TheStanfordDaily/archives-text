### 
Because the squad has but
week's work behind it and is no
as yet in good form even for earl
season, this afternoon's practice
traek and field meet will be strict 1;
informal in character, according ti
Assistant Coach Bill Ellington.
The meet, first of the weekly fai
events, will be held at the praetin
oval beginning at 4:20 o'clock.
Most of the track events, with tin
exception of the prints and quarter
mile, will be shortened. The 88<
men will run less than two laps
while the milers will only go arourn
three times. No two-mile will bi> rut
until next week at least.
Of particular interest will be th<
sprints, with Hec Dyer, Hables
Howell, Giberson, and Wilson <*x
pected to put up good races.
Eastman Rack
Eastman, last season's freshmat
440-yard race, and Ike Hables wil
furnish the principal interest in tlu
one-lap event.
A large number of "dark horses'
are entered in the half-mile, am
Ellington is looking for a surprisi
or two. Among the favorites an
Nalen, Storm, and Mires.
The mile will see Brown, Storm
Azevedo, Parker, Hunter, and pos
sibly others in. action.
Little can be said about the field
events, as most of the weight men
and pole vaulters are still out foi
football. Zuger furnished the thrill
of yesterday's practice, tossing tin
javelin 19(> feet, and may repeat In
day.
