# AIM OF UNIVERSITY BOOK CLUB RELATED BY COMMITTEE HEAD
## 
### 
"Because students have rather
commonly criticized the University
Library for its inability to provide
works of current importance as they
are wanted the Stanford University
Library Book Club came into ex
istence," said William Hawley Davis,
of the Press department, chairman
of the executive committee of the
club.
"The idea of a club for making
accessible recent books in variety
came from the University of Toron
to, through Nathan Van Patten, for
merly of Amherst and now director
of the University Library."
Brings Recent Books
The club has been organized and
in operation since April 1929. The
service of the club, to be had by the
payment of $10 dues per year, is the
privilege, of access to books to be
selected and purchased by the
executive committee, which were to
be catalogued, stored, and distri
buted to members from a room in
the' University Library.
"As books are relinquished by the
club, through the executive com
mittee, they are to become ihe
property of the University Library
to be embodied in the general col
lection," said Professor Davis. "A
double incentive of having access Lo
recently published books and of aid
ing the University Library in fields
not covered by the regular appro
priation was thus provided."
It is the aim of the committee to
make really desirable new works
available on or near the publishing
date, and with this end in view over
30 new books have been added this
September, all of which have been
published in the last two years.
Endorsed by Swain
"The present regulations," said
Professor Davis, "permit the with
drawal by each member of iwo
books at a time, for as much as two
weeks, and a waiting list for given
works with the privilege of notifica
tion when the work is available."
To a large extent, the opportuni
ties afforded by such a collection
on the campus have been neglected
by the student body. Fearing that
ihe dues for the year may have
been an obstacle to joining the
club, membership for a single quar
ter has been arranged for $3.50,
which can be taken out by faculty
members, and others of the com
munity who prefer it.
"The club has been endorsed,"
said Professor Davis, "in emphatic
terms by Acting President Robert
E. Swain and Professors Margery
Bailey, E. G. Martin, and Lewis M.
Terman.
