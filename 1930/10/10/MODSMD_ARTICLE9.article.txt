# 1930 QUAD WINS NATIONAL HONOR
## Book Qualifies In Group Of Ten Best Annuals 
### 
The 1930 Quad has been given
All-Ameriean honor rating and
judged "excellent" by the National
Scholastic Press Association, it was
announced today.
The Association judges year books
of all the universities in the United
States and classes them according
to their merits. Universities whose
books are usually placed in the
first group have an average student
body of 13,000. Only ten books are
placed in the group and these are
not rated further.
Judgment is made by the Asso
ciation after consideration of the
plan and theme of the book, sec
tions treating with administration
and faculty, classes, organizations
and activities, school life, editing
and make-up, and mechanical con
sideration such as printing and
binding. A rating of "bonus" is also
given for good financial status. The
Stanford Quad had an almost per
fect rating, no year book being ab
solutely perfect.
This is the first Quad since 1026
to be placed in the first group. Stan
Milne was its editor and Jerry
Richardson its business manager.
