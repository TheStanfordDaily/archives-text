# BETTY ALDEN STRESSES WOMEN'S RESPONSIBILITY UNDER NEW RULES
## 
### 
"The debt of every member of the
Five Hundred to the University ad
ministration in the matter of revised
lockout rules is of greater impor
tance perhaps than any other fac
tor," is the opinion of Betty Alden,
president of the Associated Women
Students.
"We, as students, asked for great
er social liberty and the administra
tion has granted our request for one
year. The great fear of the Univer
sity in granting such an increase in
freedom lies in the probability that
there will be a parallel increase in
the waste of time among women stu
dents. Scholastic statistics show that
the men's average is considerably
lower than that of the women. The
administration, believing that wom

en's regulations are in p;ftt respon
sible for this difference, was reluc
tant to encourage a lowering of the
women's average. 1
"The Five Hundred, therefore, are
now bound in duty to prove that
i more lenient rules will not increase ;
the amount of time wasted. Having |
proved this, we will have earned the
right to keep them."
j The economical use of time, Miss I
Alden pointed out, is merely a mat- '
ter of common sense. New women,
1 she believes, should make every ef
fort to form sensible habits as to I
the use of their time.
"We must show the administra
i tion," she concluded, "that we arc
capable of using freedom wisely and
without injury to our scholastic !
standing." ,
