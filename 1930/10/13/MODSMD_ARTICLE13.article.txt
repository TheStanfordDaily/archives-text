# Who Is Stanford's President?
## 
### 
(Editorial)
i lie Daily this morning prints in adjoining columns the news J
that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's leave from the presidency of the
University has expired. At present Dr. Wilbur is supposed to be
president of this institution and occupying his office in the Admin-;
istration Building.
Instead Stanford is without its president, lie is acting as ai
member of President 1 loover's cabinet at W ashington. Meanwhile |
his duties as head of the institution are being performed by an act
ing president, whose powers of administration are limited.
While Dr. W ilbur is away from the I niversity, policies and
decisions of the institution are delayed. This is hampering the edu
cational program and is proving to be an obstacle in the University's j
progress.
There is no doubt that Dr. W ilbur has done wonders for Stan-i
ford and that he is the man qualified to be its chief executive. 1
However, no man —gifted as he may be—can occupy two positions j
of great responsibility as Dr. W ilbur is doing.
In fairness to the University and to the department of the
interior it is only right that a choice be made between the two!
positions.
Should Dr. Wilbur refuse to resume hi> post here—in case the i
Hoard of Trustees demand his return or his resignation—Stanford's j
loss would be great.
'The Daily would like to see Dr. Wilbur back in his office here.!
Stanford needs a great leader —needs him more than ever in this j
. !
day of changing educational standards.
