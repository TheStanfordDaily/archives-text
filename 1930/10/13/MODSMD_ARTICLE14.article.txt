# Infantile Paralysis Not Always Dangerous Says Doctor Schultz
## 
### BY WILLIAM LESTER WALLS 
ANYONE may have had infantile paralysis, scientifically known as
poliomyelitis, and never have known the difference, according to Dr.
E. W. Schuitz, professor of bacteriology, who is carrying on experimenta
tion in that field of scientific research.
"As a disease 'polio' may run a very mild course without any evidence
of paralysis at all. Many of us may have come in contact with the virus
and overcome it without difficulty and in doing so immunized ourselves
further attack of the dreaded

disease.
"Persons who have become thus
immunized present in their blood
substances or antibodies which in
activate the virus. Such antisera
when transferred to a patient in the
early stage of the disease are of
definite thereapeutic value.
Immunity Acquired
'"It seems probable that the im
munity which a large number of
adults possess is an acquired prop
erty rather than a natural endow
ment, and probably results from
subclinical infection with the virus.
However, to determine whether it
is actually acquired or not, it would
be necessary to test a large number
of children and adults. If children
were found uniformly susceptible
and adults uniformly refractory the
conclusion would be that the im
munity is acquired as the result of
subclinical contact with the virus.
"At present the amount of human
'polio' convalescent serum obtain
able is small and we are therefore
endeavoring to find normal adults
whose blood presents a sufficient
concentration of antipolio immune
substance to be of thereapeutic
value.
"Poliomyelitis is characterized by
the rapidity with which it attacks
its victims. In the typical disease
paralysis often appears within a day
or two after a train of symptoms
which can not readily be differen
tiated from the outset of a variety of
other infectious diseases.
"The virus, which enters by the
mucous membranes of the upper
respiratory tract, after its entrance
into the body, finds its way to the
anterior portion of the spinal cord
where it destroys the nuclei of the
motor nerve cells and thus causes
paralysis.

"The virus, which enters by the
mucous membranes of the upper
respiratory tract, after its entrance
into the body, finds its way to the
anterior portion of the spinal cord
where it destroys the nuclei of the
motor nerve cells and thus causes
paralysis.

ANYONE may have had infantile paralysis, scientifically known as
poliomyelitis, and never have known the difference, according to Dr.
E. W. Schuitz, professor of bacteriology, who is carrying on experimenta
tion in that field of scientific research.
"As a disease 'polio' may run a very mild course without any evidence
of paralysis at all. Many of us may have come in contact with the virus
and overcome it without difficulty and in doing so immunized ourselves
further attack of the dreaded

disease.
"Persons who have become thus
immunized present in their blood
substances or antibodies which in
activate the virus. Such antisera
when transferred to a patient in the
early stage of the disease are of
definite thereapeutic value.
Immunity Acquired
'"It seems probable that the im
munity which a large number of
adults possess is an acquired prop
erty rather than a natural endow
ment, and probably results from
subclinical infection with the virus.
However, to determine whether it
is actually acquired or not, it would
be necessary to test a large number
of children and adults. If children
were found uniformly susceptible
and adults uniformly refractory the
conclusion would be that the im
munity is acquired as the result of
subclinical contact with the virus.
"At present the amount of human
'polio' convalescent serum obtain
able is small and we are therefore
endeavoring to find normal adults
whose blood presents a sufficient
concentration of antipolio immune
substance to be of thereapeutic
value.
"Poliomyelitis is characterized by
the rapidity with which it attacks
its victims. In the typical disease
paralysis often appears within a day
or two after a train of symptoms
which can not readily be differen
tiated from the outset of a variety of
other infectious diseases.
