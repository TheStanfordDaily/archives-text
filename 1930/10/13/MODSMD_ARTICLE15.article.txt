# NO NEW CASES OF 'POLIO' DISCOVERED ON CAMPUS-STOREY
## 
### 
Although from 50 to 90 men were
reporting daily to the men's student
health service last week and a pro
portional number of women to the
women's medical adviser, none of
those students had poliomyelitis
(infantile paralysis), according to a
statement made last night by Dr.
T. A. Storey, medical adviser for
men. No new cases of the disease
have been discovered.
Dr. Storey advises, however, the
continuance of the habit of report
ing any indisposition to the health
service at once. His statement, in
part, is as follows:
'"Not one of these students" (those
reporting to him), "has polimyelitis
and no student, nor anyone else
that I know of, is under observation
suspected of having poliomyelitis.
David Duniway is now declared to
have that disease. He was not so
well at one time last week, but is
now much better. Patty Baker, at
last report, was much improved; she
is now in the Children's Hospital in
San Francisco.
''The students that reported to the
medical adviser's offices last week
complained mostly of colds. This is
the time of year when colds are
common. It is urged that the stu
dents continue the practice of re
porting their illnesses without delay
to the student health service of
fices. It is a good health habit at all
times and especially now."
Hours for consulting the student
health services are from 9 to 12
o'clock in the morning and from 1
to 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
Saturday hours are from 9 to 12
o'clock in the morning.
