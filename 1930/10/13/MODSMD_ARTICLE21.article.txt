# CARDS TO PLAY NORTHWESTERN;
## Negotiations Made For '32 And '33 Contests 
### 
With the scheduling of home and
home intersectional contests with
Northwestern University for 1932
and 1933, Coach "Pop" Warner's big
red machine will have opportunity
to gain additional fame in the eyes
of far-off gridiron fans.
That Stanford representatives at
Minneapolis had negotiated with
Coach Dick Hanlcy of Northwestern
for the games was confirmed yester
day by Dr. T. A. Storey, head of
the physical education department.
Approval Needed
According to Storey, the games
have yet to be approved by the fac
ulty athletic committee and the
president of the University. The ar
rangement has been under consider
ation by W. B. Owens, faculty ath
letic representative, and A 1 Masters,
graduate manager of the Board of
Athletic Control, for some time.
With this new addition in inter
sectional tilts, Warner's Redshirts
now have a total of five contests
scheduled with leading grid teams
from the East and Middle West.
This season the Dartmouth struggle
is yet to take place here in the
Stadium, while in '31 the Cards will
journey East to meet the same out
fit. Next year Minnesota will bring
her gridiron talent to the Pacific
slopes.
Formidable Foe
In Northwestern, Stanford has
picked for herself a formidable foe,
which uses Warner's own system of
play. Coach Hanley, who is assisted
at the Middle West institution by
Spud Lewis, Stanford '29, has put
out teams that have nearly always
been strong contenders for the Big
Ten title. Though last year his war
riors only tied for third place, they
showed plenty of power in their
first conference start of this season
Saturday when they upset the high
ly touted Ohio State outfit by a 19
to 2 score.
