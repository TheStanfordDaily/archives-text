# FOOTBALL'S AID TO EDUCATION

### 
Stanford's Hoard of Athletic Control broke into public print
recently when the news that a 10-year building program involving
the expenditure of approximately $1,035,000 was announced to a
work-a-day world mindful of the so-called fabulous sums gathered
in at the football turnstiles.
The program included additions and improvements to the Stan
ford athletic plants, both men's and women's. The 15.A.C. is con
tributing $225,000 to the new women's gymnasium, $125,000 on
the stadium. $100,000 for basketball improvements, $00,000 for
squash courts, besides many other projects.
When the year 193 X rolls around on the calendar, the Stanford
athletic equipment will be one of the most complete plants in the
country. With this in operation, every student in the University
will have a chance to participate in one or more athletic activity.
I'lit back of this improvement lies the one source of income—
the football receipts. During the six years covered in the B.A.C.'s
fiscal report, it was shown that the gridiron yielded 00.7 per cent
of the more than two million dollars total receipts. No other sport
approaches football as an income-producer.
It is perhaps unwise to stress the importance of football as a
money-maker: educational authorities through the country probably
do as much as possible in concealing the amount of money they
rolled, but the fact remains—football does contribute a huge sum.
