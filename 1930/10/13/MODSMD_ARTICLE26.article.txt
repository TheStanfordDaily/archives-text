# INK AND APPRECIATION
## 
### 
After many inkless days, there is again ink in the Library. But
the ink room, bespattered by generations of students and faculty
members, is a thing of the past. Since the opening of the present
quarter il has been locked, and so it will remain in the future.
But there is ink to be had in the Library. Students may now
refill their pens at the attendant's desk in the Reserve I look Uoom.
Librarian Van Batten closed the ink room because it was so
slained it had become an unsightly spot in an otherwise attractive
building.
The ink room's users in preceding quarters were lacking in ap
preciation and were mistaken as to its purpose. They thought it
was a place to play, and so they played, spraying ink hither and
nut about the room.
It will be well for them to utilize the new ink supply in a man
ner which will insure its remaining at their service.
