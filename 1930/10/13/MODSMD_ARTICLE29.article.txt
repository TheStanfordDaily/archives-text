THREE FRENCH GIRLS at the New
Stanford Theater
One French girl in a picture is
apparently not enough, so now we
have three finished Parisian prod
ucts chattering in a voluble French,
and decorating the scenes very
nicely.
There really isn't even a shadow
of a plot in this show, but P. G.
Wodehouse wrote the dialogue and
that in itself is sufficient for plenty
of laughs.
Reginald Denny makes a typical
Wodehouse hero; his "what-hoes,"
"pip-pips," gardenias, and silk hats
are all true to form. Fifi Dorsay, the
original French girl, is helped along
by two newer ones, Yola D'Avril :
and Sandra Ravel, who are almost
as peppy and loquacious as Fifi. J
Ukulele Ike also enlivens the pic
ture with his inimitable songs. j
—N. J.
NIGHT WORK—At the Varsity
Theatre.
"Night Work" is one of those ;
perennial movies with a plot bear
ing somewhat of a resemblance to '
a weak backbone. Nevertheless, with
Eddie Quillan playing the part of j
the hard-working young man, who ;
outwits the big business man, and ;
wins the girl—in this case Sally
Starr—the tone of the movie comes i
up quite unexpectedly.
The comedy element has been '
overdone in that it is too insistant, ;
but one must admit that Quillan's i

singing was handled very well and
that his voice has possibilities. Had
the continuity been considered a
little more and the abilities of Quil
lan called upon, the weakness of the
plot would have been more than
offset, but even so the film is bet
ter than the average. K. H.
JEWS WITHOUT MONEY. By Mi
chael Gold. Horace Liverfight,
Inc. New York, 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Horrors of poverty on New York's
East Side, where life is a seething
cauldron of Jews, Poles, Irish, and
Germans, living and dying in sweat
i and blood, are vividly described in
'"Jews Without Money," the story
1 of Michael Gold's boyhood.
Fighting, bedbugs, filth, despair,
1 even murder, made up his existence
almost from the time that he was
' first able to walk.
One of his boyhood pastimes was
to gather with his comrades and
jeer at the prostitutes who occupied
rooms in his own tenement house.
He saw his sister killed under the
wheels of a passing truck, his father
' lose his life's savings by means of
\ fraud and accident.
j For recreation he would beg rides
Ito funerals from the East Side
; hearse drivers.
It is truly a dark and sombre
: picture that Gold paints. His char-
I acters are real. His only hope of
; improving their condition is through
a great workers' revolution.

THREE FRENCH GIRLS at the New
Stanford Theater
One French girl in a picture is
apparently not enough, so now we
have three finished Parisian prod
ucts chattering in a voluble French,
and decorating the scenes very
nicely.
There really isn't even a shadow
of a plot in this show, but P. G.
Wodehouse wrote the dialogue and
that in itself is sufficient for plenty
of laughs.
Reginald Denny makes a typical
Wodehouse hero; his "what-hoes,"
"pip-pips," gardenias, and silk hats
are all true to form. Fifi Dorsay, the
original French girl, is helped along
by two newer ones, Yola D'Avril :
and Sandra Ravel, who are almost
as peppy and loquacious as Fifi. J
Ukulele Ike also enlivens the pic
ture with his inimitable songs. j

NIGHT WORK—At the Varsity
Theatre.
"Night Work" is one of those ;
perennial movies with a plot bear
ing somewhat of a resemblance to '
a weak backbone. Nevertheless, with
Eddie Quillan playing the part of j
the hard-working young man, who ;
outwits the big business man, and ;
wins the girl—in this case Sally
Starr—the tone of the movie comes i
up quite unexpectedly.
The comedy element has been '
overdone in that it is too insistant, ;
but one must admit that Quillan's i

singing was handled very well and
that his voice has possibilities. Had
the continuity been considered a
little more and the abilities of Quil
lan called upon, the weakness of the
plot would have been more than
offset, but even so the film is bet
ter than the average. K. H.
JEWS WITHOUT MONEY. By Mi
chael Gold. Horace Liverfight,
Inc. New York, 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Horrors of poverty on New York's
East Side, where life is a seething
cauldron of Jews, Poles, Irish, and
Germans, living and dying in sweat
i and blood, are vividly described in
'"Jews Without Money," the story
1 of Michael Gold's boyhood.
Fighting, bedbugs, filth, despair,
1 even murder, made up his existence
almost from the time that he was
' first able to walk.
One of his boyhood pastimes was
to gather with his comrades and
jeer at the prostitutes who occupied
rooms in his own tenement house.
He saw his sister killed under the
wheels of a passing truck, his father
' lose his life's savings by means of
\ fraud and accident.
j For recreation he would beg rides
Ito funerals from the East Side
; hearse drivers.
It is truly a dark and sombre
: picture that Gold paints. His char-
I acters are real. His only hope of
; improving their condition is through
a great workers' revolution.
