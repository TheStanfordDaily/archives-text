# BLUE BAND OF CARD GUN HEADING HOME
## Mid-Westerners Win Moral Victory In Holding Redshirts, 0-0 GOPHERS KEYED HIGH 
### Leu Kallmann 
En route to Stanford today, a band
of despondent Cardinals are collect
ing their thoughts and recalling in
cidents of what turned out to be a
disastrous expedition to the Middle
Wt;st. Although flashing a brilliant
system of offense which completely
overshadowed the Gopher plays,
Stanford was unable to shove over
a score Saturday.
Harlow Rothert, Phil Moffatt, and
Phil Neill's names will be remem
bered by all who witnessed the
clash, but the stubborn defense of
the desperate Minnesotans which
averted disaster time after time re
mains (he outstanding feature of
the game.
Gophers Strong
Keyed up to the highest pitch for
Stanford because of the torrents of
criticism unleashed against them,
the Gophers won respect as well as
a moral victory Saturday. Accord
ing to press reports, it was a quiet
group which filed into the visitors'
dressing room, a team which had
fought and fought hard to no avail.
But the Cards cannot remain de
spondent for long. Outlined against
the horizon are the men of Oregon
State. Big and tough, they will in
vade the Stadium Saturday for
Stanford's first Conference game.
Always dangerous, the Beavers are
potentially capable of defeating
Warner's men, and a downhearted
crew of Cardinals would be easy
meat.
S.C. Dangerous
After Oregon State comes the
Cardinal and Gold wrecking ma
chine from Southern California. For
the past three years Jones and his
Trojans have been worse than a
thorn in the side of Stanford, and
this season will be no exception. The
Cards have their work cut out, and
the support of the campus is essen
tial to the success of the football
team.
Warner's men are deserving of the
plaudits of the student body, for
they gave everything they had in a
vain effort to win. In this year of
football, a team is not permitted to
take more than a day or two to snap
out of the slough of despond into
which they are tossed by a reverse,
and an enthusiastic welcome will be
the best antidote for the blues.

the game.
Gophers Strong
Keyed up to the highest pitch for
Stanford because of the torrents of
criticism unleashed against them,
the Gophers won respect as well as
a moral victory Saturday. Accord
ing to press reports, it was a quiet
group which filed into the visitors'
dressing room, a team which had
fought and fought hard to no avail.
But the Cards cannot remain de
spondent for long. Outlined against
the horizon are the men of Oregon
State. Big and tough, they will in
vade the Stadium Saturday for
Stanford's first Conference game.
Always dangerous, the Beavers are
potentially capable of defeating
Warner's men, and a downhearted
crew of Cardinals would be easy
meat.
S.C. Dangerous
After Oregon State comes the
Cardinal and Gold wrecking ma
chine from Southern California. For
the past three years Jones and his
Trojans have been worse than a
thorn in the side of Stanford, and
this season will be no exception. The
Cards have their work cut out, and
the support of the campus is essen
tial to the success of the football
team.
Warner's men are deserving of the
plaudits of the student body, for
they gave everything they had in a
vain effort to win. In this year of
football, a team is not permitted to
take more than a day or two to snap
out of the slough of despond into
which they are tossed by a reverse,
and an enthusiastic welcome will be
the best antidote for the blues.
En route to Stanford today, a band
of despondent Cardinals are collect
ing their thoughts and recalling in
cidents of what turned out to be a
disastrous expedition to the Middle
Wt;st. Although flashing a brilliant
system of offense which completely
overshadowed the Gopher plays,
Stanford was unable to shove over
a score Saturday.
Harlow Rothert, Phil Moffatt, and
Phil Neill's names will be remem
bered by all who witnessed the
clash, but the stubborn defense of
the desperate Minnesotans which
averted disaster time after time re
mains (he outstanding feature of
the game.
