HELP THE CELLAR
The Editor, Sir:
We would like to request the vari
ous members of the Student Body to
give the new management of the
Cellar a sporting chance. It is too
much to expect perfection in a mo
ment, and while the old order may
not seem to have been replaced,
lime must be given before improve
ments can be noted.
The students themselves can as
sist the service by making up their
minds as to what they will order
before calling for the hashers (par
don me, I meant waiters), and by
not keeping the waiters waiting.
Hopefully,
L. Kullmann, Jr.
WE MOURN HIS PASSING
The Editor, Sir;
In the tragic death of John Cush
ing Duniway, '25, J.D. '27, in a San
Francisco hospital, Friday, a rare
and noble spirit has passed from
among us. I recall my first meeting
with him at a pre-season debate
rally back in 1924. Fresh from a
year at Oxford, he seemed the very
embodiment of what one likes to
think of as the sporting decency
and fine intelligence of the tradi
tional English schoolboy. Yet, he
was passionately American in his
feelings, just as he was distinctly
American, indeed Western, in his
attitudes and enthusiasms.
His was a charm of person and
intellect rare indeed in one of his
years. Cultured, mellowed—yet vi
brant—with a rich background of
travel and reading; gracious and
fairminded. yet partisan of the right
and intensely intolerant of the
mean, or the unfaithful, or the vi
cious. his every mood and act bore
the unmistakable stamp ' of the
thoroughbred.
I suppose in all the long range
of Stanford debating, there has
never been a speaker of more flash
ing intelligence, or more gracious
gift of phrase. Without in the least

! affecting the Oxford manner (for
his accent was decidedly American)
j he was able to infuse into his flow
ing sentences a most indescribable
cogency and charm. Winner of the
I coveted Joffre prize in 1925, invalu
able helper of the squad which met
the famous Oxford team of that
j year, admired almost to the point
of idolatry by his colleagues and his
I successors, John Duniway had be
come almost a legend within the
| Stanford debating fraternity. His
I passing will find its repercussions in
j the hearts of his generation of Stan
! ford debaters everywhere. His like
is not seen every day.
Very sincerely yours,
J. Gordon Emerson,
Faculty Debating Adviser.
CONSIDER THESE POINTS
l The Editor, Sir:
I I wonder if anybody has ever
commented that clapping after the
yells has a poor effect? I believe
| that clapping spoils everything. It
j would be all right if all the students
: who yelled, clapped, but as it is
: done at present, it is really terrible
i —all the pep of the yell is spoiled
by the lack of pep of the clapping
i part.
I would suggest that the clapping
! be discontinued, and that the yells
' be made sharp and snappy, which I
' think makes them more effective.
Now that I am writing to you, I
think I should mention the poor
service given in the store of the
Men's Gym, especially when one is
; waited on by the eldest of the
clerks. He does nothing but smoke
his pipe and look at you without
; daring to come over and see if you
: need anything, as if he were afraid
of being eaten un.
And when he comes over, oh sir,
I it's you who has to run away. He
possesses the worst disposition 1
; have ever seen in a man. I don't
wish to do him any wrong, but I
; surely hope that somebody else re
' places him.
Yours truly, Alfred Betteley.
