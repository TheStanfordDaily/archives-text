# Cabbages and Things

What with all the upsets in foot
ball scores Saturday, a fellow hard
ly dares to bet on his own fraternity
brother. We've always been told
that gophers were a menace to peo
ple on farms, but didn't realize how
well they could stand up and fight.
In this case, they weren't at all dan
gerous, but so annoying!
It seems to be the little things
that count. Take that one yard
that wasn't made, in the fourth
quarter, for instance ....
In a way, the repair work being
done on campus is an insult to some
of us. Believe it or not, there are
"No Parking" signs beside the ditch
on Santa Teresa street. As if any
of us—but why make unnecessary
comment?
And pedestrians have to clam
ber laboriously (o gel across the
ditch. Reminds us of movies of
the Paris underworld. How low
arc we, (hat we must climb over
a pipe line?

j Several fraternities have an
nounced new pledges, but so far
we've had no such notice from the
Chinese and Japanese clubs. Greek
letter rules probably don't mean
much to them, but someone might
check up. *
There might be some shanghai-ing.
Taking just the right perspective
on the Phi Delt house and yard,
you can see the upper half of an
ancient, bright blue Ford, resting
on wooden stilts, as nearly as we
can tell without appearing curious.
Wonder what they're using it
for—it (louMess has something
to do with the great hack-to
nature movement.
Maybe it's just a big flower pot,
for geraniums and gardenias and
things. Or maybe they'll use it on
Lagunita, next spring—something
new and different in boats.
The lake-bottom's already getting
| muddy. Just give it time!
