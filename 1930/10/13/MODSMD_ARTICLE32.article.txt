There has always been an argu
ment as to whether or not paying
college athletes to wind eight-day
clocks was "subsidizing" them.
At U.S.C. there is a life-insurance
selling contest. S;> far, Marshall Duf
field of the gridiron and Frank
Wykoff of the cinder track are the
two most prominent contestants.
Who mentioned the Carnegie
Foundation Report?
The University of Utah complains
that Denver University "stole"
eleven graduating high-school foot
ball potentialities from the state of
Utah.
II a true list were ever made
public of the homes of the foot
hall players on the leading
teams, a wail would be heard
that would shake the nation
from sunny Los Angeles and
California to the rocky coast of
Maine.
The University of Oregons asks
you to picture "One thousand co-eds
wearing lemon-yellow and green
chrysanthemums swaying back and
forth to the tempo of an Oregon
yell."
Try as we will, in this day of ex
pressing true individuality, we can
not picture 1000 co-eds. wearing ihe
same thing; and what is more, one
doesn't sway to the tempo of a col
lege yell. If one moves at all, one
JUMPS.
Although the University of
Occidental has not officially
abolished hazing, the Oxy stu
dents are so advanced (or
"chicken," depending on how
you stand) that they refuse to
enforce the hazing "pranks" on
freshmen, complains the campus
paper.
Personally, we take off our hat to
the Oxy students because we can
see no test of virility or manhood
in sophs paddling university tradi
tions into unwilling frosh, making
them go dateless for three months,
or any other punishment.
At the University of Milwaukee,
students as well as faculty assist in

forming the curriculum. Perhaps
now, courses that are "pipes" will
be so labeled in the announcement
and courses that are pedantically
obtruse or foolishly detailed will be
publicized as such.
