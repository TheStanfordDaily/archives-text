BURSTING BURBLES
Those loud detonations heard
rom one end of the country to the
ither lust Saturday during the
;ourse of the long afternoon, ac
cording to reports of games drift
ng in to the pupers, were merely
he collapsing of sundry coaches'
lopes. From East to West, favorites
•ollected jolts on the chin and were
orced to like it, for underdogs rose
n their wrath to smite adversaries
lip and thigh.

>e no way of defeating a le;ini which
a ill not admit it is licked. The Go
lihers were no exception to this
ule, and although they never
threatened the Stanford goal, the
inal score indicates the quality of
heir defense.
Beneath the shadow of the Cam
panile, a band of Blue and Gold
ooters rose in their seats to sing
their hymn Saturday. A peaceful
.{low pervaded their souls, for the
'Jolden Bear had returned to his
dace in the sun. And that final
eading of the scoreboard in the
Viemorial Stadium was manna to
lie visiting Redshirts, too, for it
should silence numerous carping in-
Jividuals who maintain the Gaels
and Gauls are without question pre
*minent on the Coast.
Up in Pullman, it was another
liorse on Troy. We, for one, while
congratulating "Babe" llollingbery
nid his men, are privately wonder
ing what effect it will have upon
Stanford. The Cougar's conference
schedule is now composed of Moli
lalia. Idaho. Washington, and Ore
gon State. The Northerners will en
counter no opposition worthy of the
name in that' list, with one excep
tion. Should Jimmie Fhelan and his
Huskies knock off Washington State,
ami Stanford win all of her Confer
ence clashes, all will he well. Rut if
Washington State wins 'em all and
the Cards drop one—well, that's
that.
Those same Huskies from Wash
ington mangled Idaho Saturday
without much trouble. But fireworks
are in store for the North on Octo
ber 18. since Washington meets Ore
gon in Portland. "Doe" Spears
hand-picked series of games rises
to its peak in this combat, for
should the Webfeet trample the
colors of Washington into the mud
(it is always raining in Portland)
nothing can cloud Oregon's skies
but the weather.
Slovenly playing cost the Tro
jans the game with Washington
Stale, hut the results which will
follow from that defeat do not
augur well for Stanford. Warner's
men will probably enter the game
favored to win. a terrible handicap
to begin with. Then Southern Cali
fornia. encountering Utah Aggies
next week, will be out for blood
w hen they meet Stanford, not only
because of the magnitude of the
contest l»u( also of its Conference
significance.
All in all. it appears that the
majority of (he outfits are still very
much in the race. Washington,
Washington State. Oregon, Califor
nia, Southern California, and Stan
ford will make it a six-wav struggle
to the wire from here in. L.K.,Jr.
