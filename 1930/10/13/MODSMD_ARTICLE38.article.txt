# Card Trackmen Launch 1931 Campaign
## SEVEN WEIGHTMEN NOW ON GRIDIRON; DINK WANTS THEM Trackmen Hold First Meet Of Year; Results Promising 
### Lowell Cox 
"With some decent weight men,
we'll beat U.S.C. this year."
"Dink" Templetoh speaking, infer
ring this time to track.
It's a far cry from football to the
spring sport, especially with How
ard Jones still to be hurdled before
Dean Cromwell can be given seri
ous thought, but nevertheless there
is a connection.
The particular connection is the
aforementioned weight men. There
are no less than seven—count 'em—
engaging in the grid pastime. And
although there are some 120 scantily
clad spike men cavorting about the
practice oval each afternoon, there
is a woeful lack of tossers of the
shot and discus.
At the first of the weekly fail
track meets held at the practice field
Friday afternoon, there were only
two competitors in these two events,
Krenz, who is ineligible, and Borton.
Much promise was shown in many
of the other events, especially on
the track, but with Stanford noted
for weight men, the absence of such
in the shot and discus pits seemed
strange indeed.
"Fateful Seven"
| The fateful seven includes La- '
horde, George Gray, Nellie Gray,
Tandy, Johnson, Bob Jones, and
McLeod. As early as the first week
of football practice Dink's concern
regarding these men made itself
apparent.
j "Hey there, young feller," Stan
ford's "boy coach" remarked to one
"Tiny" Thornhill at the close of
practice one night. "I want a word
j with you."
The varsity line mentor hove to,
! and was informed that when he got
j through "playing around" with
Templeton's weight men, he (Dink)
| would appreciate their return.
Can "Struggle Along"
But the seven concerned are still
; toiling for "Pop" Warner and his
I assistants, and most of them will be
| until December. Meanwhile, Tem- I
pleton and his chief lieutenant, Bill
Ellington, can "struggle along" with
out their services, having a wealth
of material in other events.
Eastman, last season's freshman
quarter-mile ace, proved one of the
| sensations of Friday's meet by win
ning the one-lap race handily. After
j a slow start he breasted the tape
well ahead of McDermott. He trav
eled the distance, which had been
| shortened to 352 yards, in the good
1 time of :39.3.
I "Podge" Smith won both hurdle
| events, which also were shortened,
i Les Hables, after loafing into second
: place in his heat, captured the finals
of the century in :10.2, good early
j season time. Hec Dyer and Lom-
I bardi did not enter.
In the half mile, which was short
: ened to G6O yards, Fullcnwidcr was
! nosed out at the tape by a new
j comer, Young, an ineligible trans
j fer from Oregon State. Undoubtedly
i more will be heard from Young next
! year, as he is a heady runner. He
covered the distance in 1:30.6.
: Hunter came through to capture
j the three-lap "mile" in 3:31.7. Nei
j ther Storms nor Brown competed in
j the meet.
Zuger Wins Javelin
I One of the best performances of
j the meet was Zuger's toss of 191
feet 9 inches of the javelin. He is
| heaving the spear beyond the 190-
I foot mark with regularity.
Austin sailed over the bar at 5
j feet BV2 inches to capture first in
! the high jump. The pole vault was
| won by Johns and Deacon at 11
| feet, with Van Dellen, Salinas frosh,
| taking third at 10 feet 6 inches.
1 On the whole, Ellington was
pleased with the showing made in
the meet. He said that for at least
two weeks more the distances will
be shortened, until the men get in
condition.
The chief concern in track circles,
other than that of the weight prob
lem, is the frosh. There is but a
small turnout at the present time.
It is expected to be increased, how
-1 ever, with the close of the football
season.

I assistants, and most of them will be
| until December. Meanwhile, Tem- I
pleton and his chief lieutenant, Bill
Ellington, can "struggle along" with
out their services, having a wealth
of material in other events.
Eastman, last season's freshman
quarter-mile ace, proved one of the
| sensations of Friday's meet by win
ning the one-lap race handily. After
j a slow start he breasted the tape
well ahead of McDermott. He trav
eled the distance, which had been
| shortened to 352 yards, in the good
1 time of :39.3.
I "Podge" Smith won both hurdle
| events, which also were shortened,
i Les Hables, after loafing into second
: place in his heat, captured the finals
of the century in :10.2, good early
j season time. Hec Dyer and Lom-
I bardi did not enter.
In the half mile, which was short
: ened to G6O yards, Fullcnwidcr was
! nosed out at the tape by a new
j comer, Young, an ineligible trans
j fer from Oregon State. Undoubtedly
i more will be heard from Young next
! year, as he is a heady runner. He
covered the distance in 1:30.6.
: Hunter came through to capture
j the three-lap "mile" in 3:31.7. Nei
j ther Storms nor Brown competed in
j the meet.
Zuger Wins Javelin
I One of the best performances of
j the meet was Zuger's toss of 191
feet 9 inches of the javelin. He is
| heaving the spear beyond the 190-
I foot mark with regularity.
Austin sailed over the bar at 5
j feet BV2 inches to capture first in
! the high jump. The pole vault was
| won by Johns and Deacon at 11
| feet, with Van Dellen, Salinas frosh,
| taking third at 10 feet 6 inches.
1 On the whole, Ellington was
pleased with the showing made in
the meet. He said that for at least
two weeks more the distances will
be shortened, until the men get in
condition.
The chief concern in track circles,
other than that of the weight prob
lem, is the frosh. There is but a
small turnout at the present time.
It is expected to be increased, how
-1 ever, with the close of the football
season.
"With some decent weight men,
we'll beat U.S.C. this year."
"Dink" Templetoh speaking, infer
ring this time to track.
It's a far cry from football to the
spring sport, especially with How
ard Jones still to be hurdled before
Dean Cromwell can be given seri
ous thought, but nevertheless there
is a connection.
The particular connection is the
aforementioned weight men. There
are no less than seven—count 'em—
engaging in the grid pastime. And
although there are some 120 scantily
clad spike men cavorting about the
practice oval each afternoon, there
is a woeful lack of tossers of the
shot and discus.
At the first of the weekly fail
track meets held at the practice field
Friday afternoon, there were only
two competitors in these two events,
Krenz, who is ineligible, and Borton.
Much promise was shown in many
of the other events, especially on
the track, but with Stanford noted
for weight men, the absence of such
in the shot and discus pits seemed
strange indeed.

j the meet was Zuger's toss of 191
feet 9 inches of the javelin. He is
| heaving the spear beyond the 190-
I foot mark with regularity.
Austin sailed over the bar at 5
j feet BV2 inches to capture first in
! the high jump. The pole vault was
| won by Johns and Deacon at 11
| feet, with Van Dellen, Salinas frosh,
| taking third at 10 feet 6 inches.
1 On the whole, Ellington was
pleased with the showing made in
the meet. He said that for at least
two weeks more the distances will
be shortened, until the men get in
condition.
The chief concern in track circles,
other than that of the weight prob
lem, is the frosh. There is but a
small turnout at the present time.
It is expected to be increased, how
-1 ever, with the close of the football
season.
"With some decent weight men,
we'll beat U.S.C. this year."
"Dink" Templetoh speaking, infer
ring this time to track.
It's a far cry from football to the
spring sport, especially with How
ard Jones still to be hurdled before
Dean Cromwell can be given seri
ous thought, but nevertheless there
is a connection.
The particular connection is the
aforementioned weight men. There
are no less than seven—count 'em—
engaging in the grid pastime. And
although there are some 120 scantily
clad spike men cavorting about the
practice oval each afternoon, there
is a woeful lack of tossers of the
shot and discus.
At the first of the weekly fail
track meets held at the practice field
Friday afternoon, there were only
two competitors in these two events,
Krenz, who is ineligible, and Borton.
Much promise was shown in many
of the other events, especially on
the track, but with Stanford noted
for weight men, the absence of such
in the shot and discus pits seemed
strange indeed.
"Fateful Seven"
| The fateful seven includes La- '
horde, George Gray, Nellie Gray,
Tandy, Johnson, Bob Jones, and
McLeod. As early as the first week
of football practice Dink's concern
regarding these men made itself
apparent.
j "Hey there, young feller," Stan
ford's "boy coach" remarked to one
"Tiny" Thornhill at the close of
practice one night. "I want a word
j with you."
The varsity line mentor hove to,
! and was informed that when he got
j through "playing around" with
Templeton's weight men, he (Dink)
| would appreciate their return.
Can "Struggle Along"
But the seven concerned are still
; toiling for "Pop" Warner and his
I assistants, and most of them will be
| until December. Meanwhile, Tem- I
pleton and his chief lieutenant, Bill
Ellington, can "struggle along" with
out their services, having a wealth
of material in other events.
Eastman, last season's freshman
quarter-mile ace, proved one of the
| sensations of Friday's meet by win
ning the one-lap race handily. After
j a slow start he breasted the tape
well ahead of McDermott. He trav
eled the distance, which had been
| shortened to 352 yards, in the good
1 time of :39.3.
I "Podge" Smith won both hurdle
| events, which also were shortened,
i Les Hables, after loafing into second
: place in his heat, captured the finals
of the century in :10.2, good early
j season time. Hec Dyer and Lom-
I bardi did not enter.
In the half mile, which was short
: ened to G6O yards, Fullcnwidcr was
! nosed out at the tape by a new
j comer, Young, an ineligible trans
j fer from Oregon State. Undoubtedly
i more will be heard from Young next
! year, as he is a heady runner. He
covered the distance in 1:30.6.
: Hunter came through to capture
j the three-lap "mile" in 3:31.7. Nei
j ther Storms nor Brown competed in
j the meet.
