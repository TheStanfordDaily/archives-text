### Feg Murray, '16 
Folks, meet Mr. Eddie Parker, of !
j Pittsburgh. Eddie is captain of the
University of Pittsburgh football
i team, and if you think being the
leader of a team that meets Syra
j cuse, Notre Dame, Nebraska, Car
; negie Tech, and Ohio State on suc
j cessive Saturdays is a simple little
1 job, you are badly mistaken. Pitt
! has polished off West Virginia al
j ready, and also meets Penn State in
| the annual Thanksgiving Day game. 1
1 Captain Eddie would probably rath
| er beat Penn State than any other
j rival, but hopes to lead his team- "
j mates through the regular season
I undefeated, as his predecessor, Cap
| tain A 1 Dimeslo, did in 1929. Yessir,
I "Pitt was a horrid word" to Waynes
burg, Duke, West Virginia, Alle-
I gheny, Ohio State, W. and J., Car
negie Tech, and Penn State last
season, but not to the Trojans of
U.S.C., who soundly trounced them
on New Year's Day in Pasadena to
the tune of 47 to 14. ,

! But to return to Eddie Baker, j
Eddie played a wonderful defensive j
game against the Mountaineers on :
October 4, and his blocking was in |
a great measure responsible for the 1
gains of Hood and Heller. These ;
two H's seem to be the main claws J
of the Panthers this season, just as :
two other H's—Hallahan and Haines 1
—were the two sharpest clams of the j
St. Louis Red Birds during the !
• world series. With Walinchus, a i
veteran of many wars, Baker, Hel- j
ler, and Hood make up a first-rate j
backfield, and Coach Jock Suther- I
land knows how to teach 'em!
This boy Walker can kick, pass,
and run with equal dexterity. He
didn't carry the ball at all in the 1
Rose Bowl game last January, but 1
his long and short passing figured j
in what scoring Pitt did do. Baker, j
like Donchess—last year's All-
America end—is an unobtrusive i
player, but he 'is in there giving \
, his best on every play.
