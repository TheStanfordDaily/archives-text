# BUSINESSMEN PROVE LIGHT WORKOUT FOR CARD FROSH ELEVEN
## Bradshaw Uses Third And Second String Men To Win, 24-0 
### 
Proving little more than a light
workout, the Armstrong Business
College eleven from Oakland went
down to a 24 to 0 defeat before the
onslaught of Coach Jimmy Brad
shaw's yearling gridders 011 the
practice field Saturday morning.
Using second and third string
men throughout the contest, Brad
shaw chose to give his reserves
some experience before the tougher
assignments of the season. Edelen
and Monsalve, ends, who started for
the Cards, were the only first string
linesmen to see action against the
business men. Hillman, Anderson,
and Lipscomb were used in the
backfield -only for short periods.
The freshman mentor is expecting
a 10l of opposition for his babe out
fit when they journey South to
tangle with the U.C.L.A. yearlings
next Saturday. In
starts the Uclans have built up a
record which indicates even more
power than has their fighting neigh
bor outfit, the U.S.C. freshmen.
Among those expected to cause
trouble for the Cards is Keebles at
fullback for the U.C.L.A. babes. So
far this season he has been the big
threat of the Southern eleven, aver
aging four yards a buck against the
Compton J.C. two week-ends ago.
Kobb, at half, is another of the
Uclans who has been getting a lot
of publicity and will have to be
watched by the Redshirts.
