# HIGH SCHOOL TEAM DEFEATS FRESHMAN SOCCER ELEVEN 3-0
## 
### 
Commerce High School took an
easy 3-0 victory from the Stanford
freshman soccer squad Saturday af
ternoon in the preliminary to the
varsity-Hornets clash. Lack of ex
perience showed up plainly in the
work of the frosh, while the high
school boys played a fast, co-ordi
nated game and had a good margin
throughout.
After yielding two scores in the
first half, the frosh tightened and
held their opponents to a single
point, made on a penalty kick, in
the final period. Johnson, a little
fellow at outside right, was the big
gest offensive threat of the Com
merce team, while Hern, center for
ward, was the leader of what little
offense the babes could muster.
