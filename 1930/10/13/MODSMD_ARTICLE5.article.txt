# Revolutionist Armies Seize All Of Brazil
## Enthusiastic Volunteers Aid Invaders in New Battles 
### 
PERNAMBUCO, Brazil, Oct. 12.
(/P)-â€”All Brazil, northeast of the
Sao Francisco river, today is in the
hands of the revolutionary armies
who, heartened by tremendous
popular acclaim, are beginning an
offensive into the states of Sergipe
and Bahia, still loyal to the federal
government in Rio de Janeiro.
The State of Alogoas fell before
forces commanded by Captain
Juarez Tavora aided by enthusiastic
volunteers of Pernambuco and
Parahyba, much as did Pernambuco
just a week ago. Two thousand
citizens of the two states enrolled
for the movement against Maceiro
and Ciudad Ologoas, and now will
assist in the invasion of the South.
Both army and volunteers left
here in trucks, multitudes gathering
in the streets and cheering them on
their way. Food, cigarettes, and
flowers were showered on the de
parting forces who took Maceiro
with little opposition and organized
a revolutionary junta there. Two
American ships in the port were not
molested.
Pcrnambuco Calm
Pernambuco, after a week of revo
lutionary rule, is calm and the peo
ple and minor officials of the old
regime are returning to their oc
cupations. The provisional govern
ment which has been organized, is
keeping several of the old officers
in their posts. A former sub-in
spector of customs has assumed di
rection of the customs offices.
Ships and mail planes from the
south are forbidden to enter Per
nambuco by the federal government
at Rio de Janeiro, although the
revolutionary government guaran
tees non-molestation of foreign
ships calling here. The new govern
ment is determining validity of the
debts left by the old government,
and is resuming payment of em
ployees and teachers.
