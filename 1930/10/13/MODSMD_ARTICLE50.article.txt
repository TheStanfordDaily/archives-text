# FROSH WOMEN STUDY 22 HOURS PER WEEK; MORE THAN AVERAGE
## Time Schedules Indicate Women Sleep On Week-Ends 
### 
Stanford women study on the
average of 18.57 hours a week and
the freshmen burn the midnight oil '
for 22 hours a week, according to
the statistics gained from the time
study made at the end of last spring
quarter.
The chart shows the results taken
from a study of ninety-seven weeks.
Time schedules were kept by a se
lected representative group of wo
men, each keeping a schedule from 1
two to four continuous weeks.
Most of the studying for any one
day was done on Sunday unless a
term paper was due, and hardly any
studying was done on Friday, ac
cording to the Y.W.C.A. committee
who went over the schedules.
Sleep Week-Ends
Sleep was, as a rrule, caught up
during the week-ends, contrary to
eastern college reports where the 1
charts show a falling off in sleep
and study during the week-end. Al
though the hours began later here,
they were longer and the number
usually exceeded any week night. |
In examining the relation be- I
tween time, classes, and studying of
the few women who spent the most j
time in activities, it was discovered !
that of the freshmen, no one spent
more than eight hours a week on
activities. The one who spent eight
hours had over average in sleep,
average in classes, although there
were no great variations from the
average.
Sophomores
In the sophomore class, the three
who spent the most time on activi
ties showed: for number one, more
time than average on study and
average in class time; for number
two, who spent 15 hours a week for
three weeks on activities, over aver
age time on sleep, less time on
study and classes; for number three,
who had an average of 39 hours a
week on activities, less time on
sleep, study, and average class time, j
The one person in the junior class i
who spent a great deal over average
time on activities spent under the
average in sleep, over the average
in study and average class time.
In the senior class six girls were
over average in the time spent in
activities and no one showed a large
number of hours, indicating a gen
eral distribution of activities.

In examining the relation be- I
tween time, classes, and studying of
the few women who spent the most j
time in activities, it was discovered !
that of the freshmen, no one spent
more than eight hours a week on
activities. The one who spent eight
hours had over average in sleep,
average in classes, although there
were no great variations from the
average.
Sophomores
In the sophomore class, the three
who spent the most time on activi
ties showed: for number one, more
time than average on study and
average in class time; for number
two, who spent 15 hours a week for
three weeks on activities, over aver
age time on sleep, less time on
study and classes; for number three,
who had an average of 39 hours a
week on activities, less time on
sleep, study, and average class time, j
The one person in the junior class i
who spent a great deal over average
time on activities spent under the
average in sleep, over the average
in study and average class time.
In the senior class six girls were
over average in the time spent in
activities and no one showed a large
number of hours, indicating a gen
eral distribution of activities.

Stanford women study on the

for 22 hours a week, according to
the statistics gained from the time
study made at the end of last spring
