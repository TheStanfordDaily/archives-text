# HORNET TEAM TIES STANFORD SQUAD IN FIRST SOCCER TILT
## 
### 
Making up in fighting spirit and
determination for what they lacked
in teamwork and experience, the
Stanford varsity soccer men held a
2-0 lead over a smoother aggrega
tion of San Francisco Hornets for
the greater part of their game Sat
urday afternoon, and apparently ;
would have won by that score if
, the team had not been weakened by
several substitutions which enabled
the Hornets to make the final count
a tie at 2-2.
Captain Eberhart opened the scor
ing early in the first half by sinking j
a long angle shot which found the j
Hornet goalie out of position and
put the Cards in the lead. After that
the feature of the game was the re
markable defensive work of Web
: ster at the Stanford goal and the
1 smooth passing attack of the invad
ing San Franciscans. A little later
in the half Miller at center forward
| made a single-handed run down the
field, dribbling with his head, and
' netted a short kick for the second
| point, but the first score would have
been sufficient to win if Webster!
had remained in the game through- i
out. I
Passing Attack
Even during the first half when
Stanford made both its scores the
play was mainly in Cardinal terri- j
tory. Time after time the Hornets
launched a beautiful passing attack
which seemed sure to score, only to
have it broken up by the remark
able work of Webster and the two
fullbacks, Dalton and Burns.
Although constantly threatening,
the invaders were unable to regis- i
ter a point until half-way through
the final period when Chalmers,
. center halfback, pushed one in. Just '
previous to that Coach Harry Ma- '
loney had started to send his re
serves.
Christensen, center half-back, was, j
next to Webster perhaps, the main j
cog in the Cardinal eleven. He was

the pivot man around whom the en
tire attack revolved, his passing and
handling of passes being much surer
than that displayed by most of the
other Cards. Nichols, playing inside
right, was another steady player
who bolstered both attack and de
fense.
While this was the first game for i
the Stanford squad it was the third j
encounter of the year for the Hor- â– 
nets.
