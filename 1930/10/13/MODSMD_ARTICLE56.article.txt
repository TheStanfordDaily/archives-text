the chancellorship, and withdrawing
from the immediate direction of ad- i

best of my life, and to which I hope
the best that remains will be dedi

At 79, in his home near Sequoia,
Dr. Jordan is at present convalescing

occurred in the summer of 1928. oc
casioned by heart trouble which has
kept him in poor health for the past
11 years.
