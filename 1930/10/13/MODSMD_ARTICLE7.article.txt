# JUNIOR WOMEN WILL HOLD GET TOGETHER PICNIC AT LAGUNITA
## 
### 
A "weenie roast" for all junior
women who live in Roble or off the
campus will be held tonight at 6
o'clock near Lagunita if the weather
permits. If the rain continues, the
gathering will be in the library on
the second floor of Roble instead.
This will be the first get-together
for the new junior transfers, who
arc particularly urged to attend.
The supper, suggested by the
Y.W.C.A., is being directed in Roble
by Aline Lissner. Catherine Cart
lidge has charge of making the fire.
