# BERLIN POLICE GUARD OPENING OF PARLIAMENT
## Reichstag Starts As Mobs Swarm Around Hall Of Legislation 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 13. (/P)—Hundreds
of police with riot equipment sup
plementing their usual pistols and
clubs formed a heavy guard around
the Reichstag building today, hours
before the opening of a session
which was expected to prove one of
the most notable since the founding
of a republic in Germany.
The House of Parliament appeared
more like a beleaguered castle than
the people's legislative hall, with
many thousands of persons swarm
ing about its approaches when the
new Reichstag, with its radically
changed alignment of parties, began
its first session since the September
election.
Recess Called
The Reichstag was called into
session shortly after 3 o'clock and
adjourned until Wednesday at the
same hour so that its conflicting
party leaders might have opportun
ity to reconcile their views on a
presiding officer.
The brief session today was pre
sided over by the venerable Centrist
Herold, whose 82 years entitled
him, as oldest member, to that
honor.
The members of the cabinet,
headed by Chancellor Bruening,
took their places not on the minis
terial benches but on the floor with
their respective parties.
When the white-bearded Herold
read his pedigree and requested any
one older than himself to come
forward, the Communists called
out: "There's where the Fascists
missed their chance." The Com
munists continued, with numerous
ironical interruptions, to try to re
tard the business program but the
Fascists remained quiet.
