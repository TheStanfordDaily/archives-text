A Prohibition Party in 1932 is
threatened by Mrs. Ella A. Boole,
national president of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, if the
two major parties call for repeal of
the 18th Amendment.
She predicted that if former Am
bassador Dwight W. Morrow is
elected Republican senator from
New Jersey that he will be the Re
publican presidential nominee in
1932.
