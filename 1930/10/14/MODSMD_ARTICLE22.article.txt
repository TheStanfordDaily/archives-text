# BURROUGHS STRESSES SCHOLASTIC ELEMENT IN MID-WEEK 2:30 RULE
## 
### 
That (He mid-week 2:30 o'clock
leave is an extremely serious matter
from the point of view of scholar
ship, and that it therefore should be
requested only after careful con
sideration is the opinion of Harriet
Burroughs, sponsor and chairman of
the lockout committee at Roble Hall.
"The Stanford system of weekly
and fortnightly assignments makes
it very difficult for a scholarship
committee to have an accurate check
on each individual's scholastic con
dition," said Miss Burroughs. "Each
member of the Five Hundred can
best judge for herself in this matter,
she alone knowing the exact amount
of work required of her. The schol
arship committee will undoubtedly
be useful, particularly in extreme
cases, but it is the individual on the

I borderline who will have to exert
her own judgment in this important
matter.
"The week being the working unit
on this campus, it is absolutely es
sential that the mid-week 2:30
| o'clock leave be utilized only where
i it• is harmonious with the rest of
the week's program. It should be
planned ahead of time, with the
week's work arranged to provide for
' the irregularity.
"A drop in scholarship among the
1 women will indicate a decided lack
of common sense in this regard; but
a prudent use of these special privi
i leges will not only justify the re
quest of the women for more liberty,
but also insure the retention of that
freedom to (his and future genera
tions of Stanford women."
