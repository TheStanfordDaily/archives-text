# GRIDMEN BACK; OREGON STATE CONTEST NEXT
## Redshirts Have But Three Days of Practice For Beavers 3 REGULARS INJURED 
### Len Kullmann 
Taking up the task of molding an
offense which cannot be denied,
Coach Pop Warner will arrive in
Palo Alto today with some 33 war
riors, and will not lose much time
in preparing the Redshirts for the
Oregon State invasion Saturday.
But three days of actual practice
are available before the game.
Stanford's injured list, while not
increased noticeably by the Gopher
game, nevertheless includes entirely
too many first string players. Bill
Bardin's stay in the clash Saturday
was not prolonged, for a recurrence
of his ankle injury forced him to the
sidelines. Tandy's knee and Cag
lieri's shoulder injuries are expected
to keep them from the active list,
against Oregon State, but the rest
of the squad appear to be fit for the
encounter.
Short Rally
According to the Rally committee,
a short rally will be held to grcel
the team today. Almost a year ago,
a winning Stanford varsity returned
from Seattle where they had out
scored the Huskies, only to be met
by an empty station in Palo Alto.
This year a rally has been ordered,
but the success of it depends upon
the students.
It will be a none too optimistic
squad which piles from the train
today, and the prospect of Oregon
State and Southern California on
successive Saturdays is not calcu
lated to arouse enthusiasm if the
team feels that the student body is
not behind them. A year ago the
absence of spirit was felt most
keenly; this year the failure of spirit
can mean much to the men.
Oregon State Next
Oregon State, having already been
defeated by the Trojans, will not be
given a chance to win, but the
Beavers can make things appear
rather torrid for the Cards. The
Northerners scored on Southern
California, and those who remember
how they scored on Stanford a year
ago with the first play will not !>'•
surprised to see the Beavers chalk
up a touchdown Saturday.
To spring all of the alibis before
Friday—the long train ride, the dis
appointing ending to the Minnesota
game, the short time remaining to
prepare for the game, and the in
juries to the men point to a close
game. Nothing should shake the
faith of the students, however, for
Stanford can and must win from the
Beavers.
Must win it is, for that terrific
drive which Oregon and Washington
State will stage can cook the Card -
inal goose unless Stanford prcscnl
a spotless record at the close of tin
year. It is no easy task which con
fronts the 1930 varsity. To win from
the Beavers, Southern California,
Washington, and California will be
a herculean endeavor, but the slogan
is, "It can be done."
