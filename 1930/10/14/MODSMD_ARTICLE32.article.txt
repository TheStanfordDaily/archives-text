# SPICE TO THE GRID MENU
## 
### 
With the announcement of the tentative scheduling of two fool
ball games with Northwestern I Diversity to be played in 1932 and
1933, Stanford supporters hail this decision to keep an intersectional
flavor in the gridiron menu.
When the two Army contests were arranged several years age
there were cries of opposition from fans who thought that the
Stanford eleven should be kept at home for benefit of local specta
tors.
lint the benefits of intersectional contests have proved so great
that opposition has turned to support. The national reputation of
Stanford teams has served doublefold to bring attention to the
academic achievements of the I Diversity as well as athletic prowess.
It also has given local fans the opportunity to view some of the
best teams of the country in action on the home field.
Arrangements are being completed to make the 1032 Stanford
Northwestern game a feature of the Chicago World's Fair. Such
publicitv should be invaluable.
