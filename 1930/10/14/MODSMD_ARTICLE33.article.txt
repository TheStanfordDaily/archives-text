# ARE THE MILD MEEK?

An English school boy committed suicide the other flay because
he did not wish to he subjected to the indignity of "fagging" as th<
Mritish term "hazing."
When an English coroner's jury strongly recommended that
fagging be eliminated from the public schools, this proposal met
with strong opposition from both teachers and graduates. The
recommendation was attacked on the grounds that the school boys
were happy because they were being educated under this servile
hazing procedure.
If Stanford organizations were to recognize fagging as a form
of hazing, the defense for its existence would not lie in the fact
that students enjoy the physical and mental anguish of hazing.
Rather it would lie in the brutish and sadistic instincts possessed
by each human being, however meek or ferocious .
It is a matter of conjecture in comparison of the English and
the American systems whether one is to be congratulated or be
rated on its stand. Certainly it is more refined and more delicate
to disguise the basic primeval instincts in the guise of amusement
and enjoyment.
