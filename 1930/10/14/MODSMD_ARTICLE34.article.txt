# THIS COLLEGIATE CYNICISM
## 
### 
\ trait of many youthful collegians is the cultivation of cyni
cism. It is an interesting development —a kind of belated adoles
ence which usually breaks out during the junior or senior years.
Very severe cases may occur in the freshman year, and this type
i> more serious and lasting.
Such an outlook is often the result of dabbling in philosophy
courses at too early an age. Youthful sages finger the down on
upper lips, or run their hands through shaggy hair and bring forth
utterances along thi* line, "Fate —all is fate—our illusions about
life —mere bubbles to be pricked—is there a (iod ?" This type i k
more to be deplored, than scorned. They generally recover shortly
after graduation, when they start looking around for work, and
shave off the budding beards.
Love tends to play a large part in collegiate cynicism. The
"voting Casanova" tvpe is especially obnoxious. Thev discourse on
love but lack vicarous experience. ()r else they have been blighted
bv an unfortunate love affair, and mistrust every woman's most
casual glance.
< )ften they take to running columns in the pajK-r. specializing it
ironic comments on local situations.
It i>- a noteworthy fact that women students are rarely affected
bv this germ. They have the good sense to realize that such a veneet
of cynicism as mo>t men affect is too superficial to be a worthwhile
"line."
The only good thing that can be said for this attitude is that it
provides diversion and amusement for presiding professors and
listening students.—l'oninna College Daily Life.
