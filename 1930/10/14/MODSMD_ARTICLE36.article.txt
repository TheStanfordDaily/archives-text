THE JOHN RIDDELL MURDER
CASE. By Corey Ford; Scrib- .
ncrs. New York. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
Corey Ford, alias John Riddell,
not so long ago penned a number of
satires using popular books of the
day as his points of attack. ' Mean
ing No Offense" appeared about a
year ago and soon after that there
burst upon the suspecting public a
howlingly funny tome called "Salt
Water Taffy."
The newest acidity of this master
of parody is "The John Riddel Mur
der Case" which is even more than j
it suggests. S. S. Van Dine is the
first but not at all the only one to
suffer. Jim Tully, Sherwood Ander
son, Theodore Dreiser, W. R. Bur
nett, Katherine Brush, Will Durant,
even Mr. Coolidge feel the prick of
this keen wit's pen.
The strange thing about the mur
der (in fact about the eighty-six
murders, for there is no scantiness
here!) is that there was no crime
at all. To be sure, there is a corpse i
which puffs at cigarettes and wrig
gles its nose in a vain attempt to
dislodge a blue bottle-fly; but
what's a corpse—amidst friends?
—J. S. S.
GENTLEMEN IN lIADES. By
Frederic Arnold Kummcr.
This is the story of Lavinia Mc-
Gann, a svelte maiden of 19 years
who meets 'a tragic end in an auto
mobile accident. She is transported
to Hades, and then the fun begins.

Ben Franklin, Noah, Cain, Hercules,
Don Juan, Casanova, and few others
fall before the charms of Lavinia,
who plays one-night stands with
; bout every well-known character
in history,
She winds up her hellish career
by knocking Satan for a loop with
her line and lines. The book is writ
ten in cleverly sophisticated fashion,
and there is not a paragraph that
has not a double meaning. Naughty
but not nice is the best character
ization we can think of. —R.J.F.
A MAID AND A MILLION MEN.
J. (J. Dunton. New York. 1930.
This is one of those books which
is characterized by white-haired
matrons as "just a little bit risque,"
but which disappoints those in
search of the truly risque.
The theme—that of a twin sister
who takes her brother's place in
the army and gets stuck in France
for several months—offers invalu
able opportunities, but the treat
ment is rather feeble. True, there
is suspense in great quantity. For
instance, the dashing young heroine
has many an adventure while try
ing to sneak an occasional bath
without discovery by her male com
rades. And other such incidents!
But a more riotous effect might
have been obtained had the author
broken loose. With an impossible
plot to begin with, Mi - . Dunton
could have hit the sky had he ut
terly banished logic from this tri
fling novel. —E. L.
