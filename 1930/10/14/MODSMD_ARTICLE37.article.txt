At. a Paly theatre, during the
i news reel last night, our collegiate
hearts thumped thumpingly when
the Stanford hymn blared itself into
| our consciousness, through the gal
; lery smoke. A little concentration
on the screen showed a peaceful
i prison scene —all the little black
i and-white-striped convicts march
ing to chow or mess or whatever
they call it behind the bars, much
like the twelve-o'clock march up
the east side of the Quad —all to
the tune of our "Hail! Alma Mater!"
We just will appear in the
news, one way, if not another.
The hymn has kepi time to
' worse marching, admittedly.
But the mere faet that they
used it at all proves that you
{ -can't keep a good red-shirt
down. Arid it isn't winter, yet. so
! we can't mean ordinary red
flannels ....
More news for the intelligentsia
' you're all supposed to represent.
Several of the larger San Francisco
theatres have recently refused to ac
cept checks from Stanford students.
• California, St. Mary's, Santa Clara,
' and (of course) Mills, are O.K. But
they declare that we don't have any
money to back us up, half the time.
Almost sounds as if someone had

made one too many "checks payable i

Today we present the second of
I our "educational comment" series j
although scientific investigation has i
been limited to very few cases— I
you will understand why, in a min
! ute. This question for serious
thought is, "Do Stanford Women j
Date?" or "The Soliloquy of a |
Campus Palm.' (There's a weak pun j
on cocoanut trees, if you can lind j
it.)
To be truly scientific, we should !
have subdivisions in our question, so
that it would read: (1) Do Stanford j
women date?—(2) How?—(3) Why? t
? And the direct answers: (1) Yes .
and no; (2) Yes and NO; (3) You
| ought to no.
In other words, some do and some
! don't. And we wonder how and ;
why some of those that do date do.
Our understanding of the formula !
j of the fortunate ones is this—lf you
j have a date, you gently ask all
j friends and sorority sisters, "What i
| are you doing this evening?" Then :
I they have to ask you, in return; !
| you say you have a date; you are <
i popular among them. (Is that ac
! tually the way it works?)
Further discussion is impossible.
We have a date with one that does.
