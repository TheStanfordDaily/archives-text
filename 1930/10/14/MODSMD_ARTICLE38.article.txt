# LOOKING AROUND

### Abe Mellinkoff 
The super-sophisticates of the
University of Illinois express a dis
like for these modern "Ex-books"
("Ex-wife," etc.).
We at Stanford agree that these
books are ready for extinction with
the possible single exception of
"Ex-President" to be published in
1932 by Herbert C. Hoover.
Davis Agricultural College is
always working on methods to
remove annoying pests. We wish
they would discover some dis
astrous powder to blow on the
individual who persists in sing
ing night after night, "Betty
Co-ed has EYES of RED for
Stanford."
A magazine at the University of
Washington will publish an article
entitled, "Does Booze Beat the Let
terman?"
From scientific observation (not
experiment) we find that most booze
will beat anybody under the table
in one hour whether he wears a
letterman's sweater or not.
Another writer at that same school
complains that "the trouble with
college is too much drinking."
According to psychology no
thought comes without outside
stimulus. What we would like to
know is where the Washington
students arc getting all their
"outside stimulus" for their
"wet" ideas?
According to the editor of the
Daily Trojan, S.C.'s "Fight On" song
is now so famous as to be sung in
the leading hotels of America.
Yes, but "Sweet Adeline" can not
only be heard in all "liberal" hotels,
but under lamp-posts, from taxi
cabs, and before fraternity houses
in the wee hours. Therefore "Sweet
Adeline" is more famous than
"Fight On."

Stanford co-eds and Stanford
roughs are always complaining
about the lock-out rules. Yet at
the University of Idaho, Sunday
dates must end at 7 o'clock in
the evening.
The editor of the campus paper
justifies the "lockout" rule with:
"And after all what entertainment
does Moscow offer on Sunday night
after 7 o'clock."
