# ROAD BUM'S CURSE PRODUCES SHOWER

### 
KEDWOOD CITY, Oct. 13. l.fl'iâ€”
Police Officer Clarence Thorp found
a weary man trudging along the
road early one morning. He ques
tioned the stranger, who resented
the interrogation, and when invited
to spend the night in the city bas
tile he laid a "curse" of a deluge
upon Thorp, the city, and the state
in general. He was jailed, mumbling
"and it will come before morning."
It sprinkled during the night and
they let him out a few hours later.
