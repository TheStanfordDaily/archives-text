FABLE
In the days of long ago, a mighty
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme,
Jul a simple wooden horse upset
iheir mighty boast,
And their glory became but a
dream.
"■J<iw the Trojans have a namesake
down in Southern Cal,
And they're boastful as boastful
can be
Rill they're going to meet their
match because the Cardinal
Will play horse with U.S.C.
Old Stanford Folk-Song
Once upon a time when red blood
lowed through the arteries of the
-Sons of the Stanford Red and when
he "hello' 'system was a reality and
lot an ideal, it was the custom for
he Stanford student body to sing
;ongs during football games. And
whenever these same Stanfordites
played a team known as the Tro
jans, it was the delight of the root
ing section to chant a simple ditty
entitled the "Trojan Horse Song."
Strange as it may seem, that brave
refrain echoing from the bleachers
et med to spur numerous red-shirt
•d warriors on to victory, and the
in.tl reading of the scoreboard in
licated another horse on Troy. But
•vil days fell upon the tribe of
,'ardjnals. A host of snakes, knick
rs, and other plagues invaded the
nice-simple Farm life, and old cus
onis were lost in the shuffle of re
idjtistment.
Coincident with the decline of en
husiastic rooters came the rise of
I'roy. Jones and his Thundering
Herd rode rough-shod over the
and, and grave anguish visited the
;ouls of the Stanfordites. Groans
ind lamentations filled the air, and
;entiemen were forced to rent their
uxedos. Pleas for a return to for
mer conditions formed on every lip,
11id keen analysists pointed out the
■orrelation between victory and the
inging of the Trojan Horse Song.
But new generations place ob
stacles in the path of those who
would return to dear, dead days.
Entering students learn "Come, Join
Lhe Band," and possibly "Stanford
Forever" because it is easily re
membered, but the "Trojan Horse
Song" remains a mystery to new
comers. Not even the freshman
bible, although chronicling the
Bum! Bum! Song" and "Flaming
Red," makes mention of this famous
ditty. Perhaps if the rooters would
again sing the song of Southern
California's downfall, victory would
follow as it did in the past.
Moral: Sing and Win.
Alas, led away by his enthusiasm,
lhe author casts a sorrowing glance
over what he has written. Those of
his readers (Joke) who are logicians
(dilto) will see immediately that
lhe fallacy of "Post Hoc, Ergo Prop
ter Hoc" creeps into the otherwise
llawless process of mental gymnas-
I ics.
For the less erudite, we hasten to
explain that this fallacy, the English
translation of the title being, "After
which, therefore because of which,"
means simply the coupling of two
unrelated facts. In a word, the sing
ing ol' the Trojan Horse song has no
I'lleH upon the final score of a foot
ball game, or at least that is the
insurance Logic gives us. But there
lire other factors to be considered.
