# Soccer Team To Open Conference Today
## CARDINAL VARSITY GIVEN EDGE OVER SAN MATEO J.C. Coach Maloney Satisfied With Playing Shown Last Saturday 
### 
San Mateo Junior College will
send its soccer team down to the
Farm this afternoon to take on the
Stanford varsity eleven in the first
game of the California soccer con
ference schedule, set for 4 o'clock
on the varsity soccer field.
Fresh from a tie game with the
strong Hornet team, the Cards ought
to rate the favorite's place for the
J.C. tilt, especially because of the
splendid defensive work shown in
Saturday's game. The San Mateans
have quite a reputation, however,
and stand a good chance to take
the Stanford squad's measure.
In September the Jaysee men
emerged victorious by a one-point
margin in a practice game with the
University of California varsity, in
dicating that they have a strong
aggregation. It is reported, however,
that California has a weaker eleven
than usual. San Mateo has won the
championship of the conference
every one of the three years of its
existence, which is an impressive
record in spite of the fact that it
has never before had to meet the
Stanford or California varsities.
On account of the soft condition
of the soccer field, Coach Harry
Maloney held no regular practice
yesterday afternoon for the varsity.
He drilled the forwards in passing
for a short time and then concen
trated on the freshman squad. He
expressed himself as being well sat
isfied with the work of the team
in general against the Hornets Sat
urday.
