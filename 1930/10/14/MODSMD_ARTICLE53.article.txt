# TOTAL OF SOCCER EXPENSES IN FOUR YEARS ONLY $2.61
## 
### 
Four years of operation on two
dollars and sixty-one cents. Such is
the record of the California Inter
collegiate Soccer Conference, com
posed of California, Stanford, San
Jose State, and San Mateo Junior
College.
The recent report of the treas
urer of this organization said that
out of the six dollars which the
three charter members, Stanford,
San Jose, and San Mateo, contri
buted toward conference expenses
when the league was formed four
years ago, $3.39 remains in the
treasury.
Expenses for the current year
amounted to $.45, spent for tele
phone calls. The average expendi
ture for any one year is approxi
mately $.65 and at that rate the
conference can run for five more
years without contributing any
more cash.
