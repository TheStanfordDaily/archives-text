# THE
						PLUNGING BRICKLAYER
## Joe Savoldi Is Tower of Strength for Notre Dame; Rockne Threat Works as Hod Carrier 
### Feg Murray, 16 
Not the least picturesque of the
Notre Dame backfield is big Joe
Savoldi, an Italian whose physical
development is only overshadowed
by that of his countryman, Primo
Camera. While Joe is some seven
inches shorter than the "Ambling
Alp," he tips the scales at 215
pounds and is a wonderful speci
men of physical development.
Broad-shouldered, with thick arms
and hands like hams, Joe worked
many years carrying bricks for his
Uncle John, the champion brick
layer of Michigan. No man, except
Joe, could carry bricks as fast as
Uncle John could lay them, and
Joe used to pile eight extra bricks
and a pail of mortar on top of his
hod, he was that strong!
Now you see how simple a matter
it was for Joe to carry half the
Wisconsin team along on his back
at Soldier Field last year. Joe was
a big hero in the 1929 Irish victory
over the Badgers, his hard hitting

| and plunging getting many precious
1 yards when they were needed.
He also thrilled the crowds at the
Notre Dame-Indiana and Notre
Dame-Navy games, but was injured
against Georgia Tech. Carnegie
Tech, however, found him complete
ly recovei'ed, so much so in fact that
he was able to make a high dive
over the scrimmage line to score
the lone touchdown that won for
Notre Dame.
Joe started out the 1930 season
just where he left off, helping to
dedicate the $750,000 stadium at
j South Bend with a victory over
Southern Methodist by receiving his
j opponents' kickoff and running
nearly the length of the field for a
spectacular touchdown. What a man
is Joe Savoldi! You'll hear a lot
more about him this fall, I'll wager,
for thai muscular back and shoul
ders, and those pile-driving legs are
bound to plough through opposing
i lines for many touchdowns!
