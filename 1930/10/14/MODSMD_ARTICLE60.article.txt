# CARD BABES WILL MEET BRUIN FRGSH IN SOUTHERN TILT
## Bradshaw Expecting Real Battle Saturday When Yearlings Clash 
### 
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw will be
expecting a lot of opposition from
the U.C.L.A. yearlings next Satur
day when the Card babes are sched
uled to journey to the Southland
for their first "conference" start.
The Bruins have a strong outfit
this year, and, according to Brad
shaw, are all pepped up about it.
The entire student body at the
southern institution seem more in
terested in the freshman team than
are most schools. It is to this squad
| that the comparatively new entrant
i in the Coast Conference has to look
' for future varsity material, since
i the varsity situation is still in its
; infancy.
I The U.C.L.A. babe record thus
far indicates that they have a
! stronger yearling eleven lhan their
veteran neighbor, U.S.C. Bradshaw
, is faced with the proposition of hav
ing to meet a surprisingly strong
j team while the season is still young.
Keebles, at half for the Bruin
i babes, has been the big threat of
the season, averaging four yards a
buck in downing the Compton J.C.
eleven, which battled the U.S.C.
youngsters to a scoreless iie a week
later.
Robb, his teammate at half, will
i also be watched closely by the Card
j yearlings, since his play thus far
! has placed him as a strong con-
I tender for individual honors in
I freshman ranks.
