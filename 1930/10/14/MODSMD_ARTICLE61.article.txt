## 
### 
REDDING, Oct. 13. (/P) â€”Major
Elgecomb of Red Bluff and Law
rence Bush of San Francisco hunted
and hunted for deer. They found
none, so parked their guns and went
fishing on the Pit river.
Just as they settled down to fly
casting a forked horn buck came
swimming down the river snorting
gloriously at the gunless hunters as
it passed them. The rifles were two
miles away.
