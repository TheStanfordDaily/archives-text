# ONLY SIXTEEN MEN OUT FOR YEARLING BASKETBALL TEAM
## 
### 
Freshman basketball turnout to
date has been somewhat of a dis
appointment, according to Coach
John Bunn, who has been drilling a
small'squad of 16 men in the funda
mentals of the court game three
afternoons a week on the Pavilion
floor.
Coach Bunn stated that of the 1G
freshmen out now thex - e are not
more than four who have had any
real basketball experience. The rest
are green to the game and the ma
jority of them are handicapped by
size.
"I have been accustomed to hav
ing a freshman turnout of 150 men,
but on coming to Stanford with its
limited enrollment I had hoped for
a freshman basketball squad of
around 50," Bunn stated.
On looking over the lists follow
ing the freshman registration in the
physical education department at
; the beginning of the quarter, Coach
Bunn says that he was agreeably
surprised to find that 152 first-year
men indicated that basketball was
their preferred sport.
Thirty-two of the freshmen who
expressed their preference for bas
ketball are now playing football.
Sixteen have already reported for
casaba practice. "But where are the
other 104 men that want to play
basketball?" Coach Bunn asks.
Freshman practice during the fall
quarter is on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons from 4 to 6 o'clock and
on Saturday mornings from 9:30 to
11:30 o'clock. Only those whose
academic class work does not con
flict need work out on Saturday,
however.
