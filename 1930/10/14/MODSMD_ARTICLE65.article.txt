## Robert Duffus, 10, Noted For Excellence of Literary Works 
### Catherine Guerard 
A large interesting photographic
study of Robert Duff us, one of the
most distinguished literary men ever
to have graduated from Stanford,
appeared on the front page of the
Book Section of a recent copy of
the Boston Transcript. Below was
an eight-column interview of the
famous author in which he was de
scribed as a long-legged, shy, but
extremely candid New Englander.
Duffus was born in Waterbury,
Vermont, in 1888, and remained in
New England until the age of 18.
He graduated from Stanford in 1910,
having majored in the History de
partment, in which department he
also later took his M.A. degree. Af
ter leaving college he was for five
years engaged in writing editorials
for the San Francisco Bulletin and
later on the staff of the San Fran
cisco Call. He married Miss Leah
Louise Deane of Palo Alto and in
1919 they moved to New York where
Duffus was associated with the old
Globe.
The New Englander has been
writing considerably. His best
known works are "The Santa Fe
Trail"; "The American Renaissance,"
which embodies the work he did
for the Carnegie Foundation;
"Books: Their Place in a Demo
cracy," which deals with the pres
ent. problems of the publishing
business. Duffus has also written
three novels: "Roads Going South,"
"Tomorrow Never Comes," and
"Coast of Eden." This last book car
ries the following dedication:
"To Henry David Gray. Professor
of English at Stanford University,
in grateful recollection of those
Sunday evening round table con
ferences at which nis incisive and
sympathetic criticism helped keep
alive certain struggling flames,
among them this glimmer, that
might otherwise have flickered out."
