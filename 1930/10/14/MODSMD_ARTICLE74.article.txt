# BEAN GROWERS TRY TO BEAT RAIN WIND
## 
### 
DURHAM, Oct. 13. W)—Bean
growers are taking advantage of
every light hour—sunlight and
moonlight hour. A bean thresher on
the Lucas ranch has been running
until midnight on occasions, or un
til the moon slips below the hori
zon. Growers have bent every effort
to beat a shift of the north wind to
rain-laden breezes.
