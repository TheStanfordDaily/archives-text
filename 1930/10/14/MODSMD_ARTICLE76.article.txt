# CARMEL CAREFULLY GUARDS EVERY TREE

CARMEL, Oct. 13. (/P) —Cities
cherishing their trees may take a
tip from Carmel where every tree 1
is jealously guarded.
The city council has decided that
anyone wishing to cut down a tree •
to make room for a building, a side
walk, or for any other very good j
reason, must first plant seeds for
two trees.
Mayor Herbert Heron, ordering
the city attorney to draw up a reso
lution covering this, said, "the artis- i
tic effect of Carmel must be kept
at all costs."
