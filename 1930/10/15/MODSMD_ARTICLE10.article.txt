BARCELONA, Spain, Oct. 14 (AP).
I â€”Four hundred students of the Bar
celona university at noon today
surged into the main assembly hall
and tore down a lifesized picture of
King Alfonso with shouts for the
republic, and "down with the king."
The mob made a bonfire of part
of the picture, after cutting out the
king's head and mounting it upon
a pole and parading with it about
the courtyard.
The demonstration occurred al
most entirely within the university
precincts. When riot squads of civil
guards and police reserves arrived
the mobs had dispersed and the
task of locating the leaders proved
I difficult.
