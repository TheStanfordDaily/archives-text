# ROTH BACK ON CAMPUS FOLLOWING TWO MONTHS TOUR OF ROTARY CLUBS
## Impressed by Influence of Organization in Promoting International Goodwill Throughout Europe 
### 
Deeply interested with the influence of Rotary clubs in Europe in pro
moting international goodwill and understanding, Comptroller Almon E.
Roth, president of Rotary International, returned to the campus today
after an absence of nearly two months, attending meetings of the organiza
tion on both sides of the Atlantic.
His first meeting in Europe was at The Hague, where was held the
first regional conference of Rotary ever called in Europe, with 800 dele-

gates representing 21 nations and
speaking four languages in attend
ance.
Visits Vienna
From there he went to Vienna in
j connection with the international
j convention to be held there the
i week of June 23, 1931, over which
Ihe will preside. Sixty-five nations
! will send 6,000 delegates to this
j meeting, half of them going from
I the United States in six chartered
| vessels.
Later he visited Nice, which is
| being considered as a possible future
j meeting place of the international
! convention, and then to Lausanne,
| where there was a conference of
i Swiss Rotarians.
On his return to America Comp
] troller Roth stopped for Rotary
i meetings at Waverley, N.Y., West
| Chester, Penn., and Vineland, N.J.,
I starting west in time to take in the
I Stanford-Minnesota game Saturday
| and to be present at two alumni
: meetings in that connection. He pre
| sided at a joint banquet of Stanford
I and Minnesota alumni in Chicago
j the evening before the game and
spoke at the Stanford dinner in
| Minneapolis after the game.
Travels With Team
' Mrs. Roth with their son, Billie,
j met the comptroller in New York,
| coming west with him and taking
I the same train with the football
j team from Minneapolis.
i "Rotary International has two ap
i proaches of influence in the field of
J international good will and under
standing, "Comptroller Roth said.
"First in the conduct of their own
i affairs the men of different nations
i learn that they can cooperate in at-
I taining common ends; second,
! through personal, friendly contacts,
I 152,000 busincs and professional men
â€¢ of different countries come to think
| of other nations in terms of friendly
i personalities. This is extending the
influences of personal meetings be
j tween the educators and professional
! men of different countries, which
have proved themselves of immense
i value.
Delegates Friendly
I "At The Hague meeting, for ex
ample, the French delegates invited
the Germans to a luncheon at which
they worked on plans to promote
friendship between their peoples."
One of the most hopeful signs that
Comptroller Roth observed in Eu
rope, he says, is that the rising gen
eration, youths from 16 to 22 years
old, arc more internationally minded
than their elders have been. "They
arc growing up," he says, "far less
intensely national minded than the
generation before them."
English, he believes, is rapidly be
coming the auxiliary language of the
world, supplanting French in that
capacity. "Difference in language,"
he remarked, has been a barrier to
international understanding. At
Vienna we noted that 80 per cent of
the business and professional men
spoke English in addition to their
native tongue."
