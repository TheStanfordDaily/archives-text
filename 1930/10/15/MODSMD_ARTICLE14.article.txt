# WILBUR, THIRD STANFORD HEAD, HAS GAINED WORLD-WIDE FAME
## 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
Ray Lyman Wilbur, at present
president, on leave, is the third of
the illustrous trio of executives who
have brought to Stanford world
wide renown.
- Coming to California when he
was a boy, Dr. Wilbur graduated
from Riverside high school and re
ceived his A.B. degree from Stan
ford in 1896, and his M.A. degree the
following year.
In 1899 he received the M.D. de
gree from Cooper Medical College,
end of this institution, which later
became the Stanford Medical de
partment, he was head from 1910
until he assumed his duties as presi
dent of the University in January
IHIIJ. It was under Dr. Wilbur's di
rection and inspiration that the

I Stanford Medical School constantly
; raised its standards until it reached
; a par with any other such institu
| tion in the country.
His executive and administrative
| ability shown in this position was
| responsible for his being chosen by
the Board of Trustees to carry on
j the work of his two predecessors
I who had established Stanford in the
| eyes of the world as a university
i of high standing.
Like the two who preceded him
Dr. Wilbur has gained world fame
Perhaps his first bid for world
recognition was his work during the
I world war as assistant food adminis
trator to his old friend, Herbcrl
Hoover.
In March 1929 it was again neces
sary for him to forsake his duties
here to assume the post of Secre
tary of the Interior in Hoover's
cabinet. He is a fellow of the Amer
ican Association for the Advance
ment of Science; a member of the
American Academy of Medicine, of
which he was president in 1912-13;
and belongs to the Association of
American Physicians, the American
Medical Association, and the Cali
fornia Academy of Medicine.
On leaving the University to as
sume his position in the cabinet,
Dr. Wilbur left his duties to Robert
Eckles Swain, chemistry head, who
is now acting president.
How long Dr. Wilbur will con
tinue in the dual capacity of uni
versity president and cabinet mem
ber is a question; but wherever his
future efforts lead him, it will be
remembered that he has proved
worthy of the position made famous
by Presidents Jordan and Branner,
his name bringing additional fame
to Stanford.
