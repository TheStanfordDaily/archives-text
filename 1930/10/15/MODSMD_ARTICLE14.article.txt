### STEWART CRAWFORD 
Ray Lyman Wilbur, at present
president, on leave, is the third of
the illustrous trio of executives who
have brought to Stanford world
wide renown.
- Coming to California when he
was a boy, Dr. Wilbur graduated
from Riverside high school and re
ceived his A.B. degree from Stan
ford in 1896, and his M.A. degree the
following year.
In 1899 he received the M.D. de
gree from Cooper Medical College,
end of this institution, which later
became the Stanford Medical de
partment, he was head from 1910
until he assumed his duties as presi
dent of the University in January
IHIIJ. It was under Dr. Wilbur's di
rection and inspiration that the

I Stanford Medical School constantly
; raised its standards until it reached
; a par with any other such institu
| tion in the country.
His executive and administrative
| ability shown in this position was
| responsible for his being chosen by
the Board of Trustees to carry on
j the work of his two predecessors
I who had established Stanford in the
| eyes of the world as a university
i of high standing.
Like the two who preceded him
Dr. Wilbur has gained world fame
Perhaps his first bid for world
recognition was his work during the
I world war as assistant food adminis
trator to his old friend, Herbcrl
Hoover.
