# GERMAN POLICE QUELL FASCISTS
## Crowd Smashes Windows; Police Use Clubs 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 14. (/Piâ€”After an
; hour of fighting, police quelled
! rioting in the vicinity of the Pots
| damerplatz early this morning.
The disturbance developed when
j theatre crowds stopped to see the
! destruction wrought by Fascist
i bands yesterday during a riot inci
dent to opening of the Rcichstag.
Rowdies saw an opportunity to
! start window smashing all over
i again and perhaps to profit by pil-
I laging. They insulted the police,
who cleared the Potsdamerplatz
i with their clubs after an hour's en-
I counter.
I Karl Zoergiebel, chief of police,
! said virtually none but Fascists had
i participated in the attacks on Jew
| ish stores yesterday. Police patrols,
: both mounted and afoot, guarded
I the business section of the city to-
I day.
It was not expected that yester
; day's disturbances would be re
| peatcd.
