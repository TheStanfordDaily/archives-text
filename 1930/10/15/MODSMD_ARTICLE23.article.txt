lis in the Parana, Sao Paulo border
area, have routed a large federal

ment at Porto Alegre, capital of Rio

the hardest fought thus far of the
engagements along the 200-mile
Parana Sao Paulo front for the pos
session of Sao Paulo.
The first battalion of the revolu
tionary army attacked the federal
position early yesterday morning
after advancing to a point between
Alfonso Camargo and Carlopolis.
Desperate fighting ensued, and after
five hours the federals gave way,
leaving dead and wounded and sup
plies behind them. They fled to
ward Carlopolis.
Many prisoners weie taken, the
announcement said, including sev
eral high officers. Among the sup
plies were rifles and machine guns.
The revolutionary troops also sus
tained some casualties.
In another encounter along the
long front, the right of which is in
the state of Sao Paulo and the left
in Pai'ana, the revolutionary forces
took 35 prisoners and captured a
lai*ge quantity of supplies, munitions
and two machine guns. The contact

here that the major operation of the
civil war may be that which is un
folding along the Paran Sao Paulo
frontier.
