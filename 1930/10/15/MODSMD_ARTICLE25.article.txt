# NEW WOMEN SHOULD CONSIDER SPIRIT OF RULES, ADVISES STRONG
## 
### 
"For women coming to Stanford
for the first time, the spirit, as well
as the letter, of the new rules should
be given consideration," was the
statement made yesterday by Mar
ian Strong, head sponsor, in an in
terview on the regulations as re
gards new women.
When a woman comes to a college
such as Stanford where her first
days are filled with adjusting herself
socially, she is naturally so thrilled
with the excitement she cannot have
a wide perspective of the freedom
here. While this applies to other
women, too, in many cases the new
women have just come from schools
or homes with close restrictions and
may be over-impressed with their
freedom.
To these now women, then, should

come the realization as soon as pos
sible that the 2:30 o'clock leaves
are for special occasions. It is for
them to learn the limit of their
vitality and not go to such extremes
as to wear themselves out perman
ently.
Since the rules were made by the
associated women themselves, it is
the duty of all the five hundred to
abide by them explicitly and help
to better them in every way pos
sible when the trial year is over.
This University now stands as
one of the most liberal institutions
in the country, and it is up to us
to justify its position by proving
that we are capable of using our
present degree of freedom without
its being detrimental to our health
or scholarship.
