# LARGE AUDIENCE ENJOYS CONCERT
## Trio Shows Versatility In Technique And Selection 
### Helen Thomas 
Playing 1o an audience which
filled practically every available seat
in the Little Theatre, a trio com
posed of Elizabeth Peirce, violinist,
Austin Mosher, baritone, and Mary
Moynihan, pianist, was enthusias
tically received last night.
Miss Peirce, who is the daughter
of Professor and Mrs. G. J. Peirce,
indicated her versatility as a violin
ist by the display of several types
of violin technique. Her tones were
smooth and clear and her bowing
excellent. In the rendition of Ravel's
"Piece en forme de Habanera" she
presented the exquisite and unusual
harmonies to advantage. The selec
tion is strongly reminiscent of the
composer's et ses
sortileges."
For an encore, Miss Peirce gave a
Kreisler arrangement of Weber's
"L'Arghetto." Her playing through
out showed a finish in technique and
a warmth of feeling that charmed
her audience.
Austin Mosher's voice is a power
ful baritone, compelling and clear.
It was better suited to the dramatic
selections on his program than
those that were purely lyric. "In
Mezo al Mar," a specially arranged
Italian folk song, was well ap
plauded by the audience, Mosher's
voice is at its best in this type of
composition. Hart's "Sea Fever" was
beautifully done. The harmonies and
peculiar rhythm of the accompani
ment lent the effect of waves in
calm and storm. Those members of
the audience who had heard John
McCormack sing the lovely "Fairy
Story by the Fire" found it equally
pleasant tonight.
Miss Moynihan was a sympathetic
and graceful accompanist through
out the program. Her touch was
light and clear and at no time was
there an over-emphasis on the part
of the piano. She fused her own
personality most successfully into
those of the singer and violinist.
