# DRAWINGS FOR NET TOURNAMENT TO BE POSTED THURSDAY
## 
### 
Entries for the interclass singles
tennis matches closed yesterday
with 134 men signed up, some of
whom will start play Thursday, at
which time the drawings will be
posted in the gym. Courts available
and time of play will be listed on
the drawings.
Coach Eiwyn Bugge expresses
hope that all entries will be particu
larly careful to note the time and
court alloted them and make it a
point to be there. "Promptness is
essential for the smooth running-ofT
of the matches," Bugge declares.
Those entered in the matches are
classified according to their respec
tive classes, the graduate students
being classified as seniors.
Men who have won a letter in
tennis and members of last year's
frosh team arc ineligible for the
matches; all others arc eligible.
The preliminary matches will be
interclass in order to select the best
men of each class to represent it in
the semi-finals.
According to the tradition the
loser of each match will be re
sponsible for the balls used.
