# ONE MORE WORD ON DR. WILBUR
## 
### 
I'resident Hoover lias deigned to notice a recent report tli.it
Stanford trustees might not renew President Ray l.yinan Wilbur's
leave of absence from the I niversity. The nation's chief executive
has declared Dr. W ilbur is too valuable a man for the government
to lose.
The chief executive, the Associated I'ress said, denied The
Daily's allegation that the board of trustees might not extend the
Stanford president's leave.
He was further quoted: "As one <Â»112 the trustees of Stanford,
1 can speak* with more authority than a student publication."'
All of which leads The Daily to believe Dr. Wilbur is to have
his leave of absence continued. And The Daily is confirmed in
this belief, as the result of a conference with William Mayo Xew
)Kill, president of the board of trustees.
