# EDUCATION AND THE FUTURE

I'nited States Kducation reports say only two per cent of the
children starting first grade work will graduate from college. The
oilier ( )Â«S per cent, apparently nnsuited for the regular academic
curriculum offered in the grammar and high schools, drop out to
begin as raw apprentices in the world of trade.
I"iitil recently nothing was done to prepare this overwhelming
majority of "non-academic" minds for their life work. The I'"rank'
Wiggins Trade School of Los Angeles is a splendid example of the
new development in public education. More than 15.000 men and
women enter its doors every year to receive instruction in any of
more than one hundred practical trades.
I Jut there are only a dozen such schools in the country: a verv
inadequate number to take care of the millions of students that need
such training.
('. C. Kienholtz. one of the developers of the Frank Wiggins
school, blames public school officials and faculties for keeping the
courses of instruction in a "rut."
"Most of our public school teachers are unfit to design or in
struct practical courses to prepare young men and women for
trades," says Kienholtz.
"Teachers go through the regular academic routine, and then
plunge directly into their profession with little or no contact with
the business world. Hence they are unprepared for anything hut
t<> feed hack the same stereotyped curriculum that they themselves
learned."
Courses of study today are said to he the same as they were in
our grandfather's time. Tints far teachers are supposed to have
done little to take care of the misfits.
Kienholtz suggests that the business men of America take it
upon their shoulders to secure practical training for trades. For it
i>- business that suffers when it is annually flooded with thousands
of unskilled workers.
College students today will be the leaders in the business and
professional world tomorrow. They can do much to insure greater
prosperity and end business depressions in future years, by enlisting
themselves now in the campaign to replace inefficient employees
with those of more practical education.
