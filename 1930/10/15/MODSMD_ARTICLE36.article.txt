A MAN AND HIS DOG. By Thomas
Mann. Alfred A. Knopf; New
York. 1930.
This book is no more or less than
its title indicates. There are no
characters other than (he man and
his dog, for other people are merely
mentioned and they have no im
portance in the story.
There is, properly speaking, no
plot. The book is a series of remini
scences about the author's compan
ionship with his dog and he does
not seem to be concerned with the
order in which he set:; down the in
cidents.
The dog is a sturdy mongrel ter
rier who, while he does not possess
a number of desirable virtues, is
contrasted favorably with the aris
tocratic collies who preceded him.
Occasional philosophic remarks
are interesting. Watching the dog
chase mice, the author remarks, "is
i not fear only an intensified feeling
j for life? If no Bashan existed, the
j little mouse would very likely be
bored to death." And "How beauti
ful it is, how edifying to see a liv
i ing creature unfolding all its forces
in some supi*eme effort."
But such things are not the cause
for the existence of the book. It is
1 an unambitious, simple attempt to
describe something of beauty, and
it is not unsuccessful. —E. E. W.

LADY OF DAYLIGHT. By G. IYI.
Attenborough. Stokes, New
York. 1930. (Al the Palo Alto
Book Store.)
"Lady of Daylight" is the tale of
a very charming English lady, but
unfortunately while it makes de
lightful reading, it is extremely un
convincing. Ladies such as Dianeme
Dainty, faultless in beauty and
character and possessed of an un
limited culture and wit are hardly
probable. Perhaps, however, such a
book as this may serve as a relief
from volume after volume of ultra
realistic trash.
The plot is simple. G. M. Atten
borough describes Dianeme's lile,
her early marriage, the death of her
young husband, the upbringing ol
her son, in fact a not unusual life
of on English gentlewoman. The
war is lightly touched upon. There
are scenes of Oxford and of Au
vergne and the Basque country,
beautifully done. The author's
background in French literature and
history is remarkable.
The style and execution of Lady
of Daylight is finished. It is rare
that one has the chance to read
such a polished dialogue; while
Dianeme's letters are sparkling. But
in spite of this veneer, something is
missing. The book lacks power, con
viction. It is beautiful but unreal.

beautifully done. The author's
background in French literature and
history is remarkable.
The style and execution of Lady
of Daylight is finished. It is rare
that one has the chance to read
such a polished dialogue; while
Dianeme's letters are sparkling. But
in spite of this veneer, something is
missing. The book lacks power, con
viction. It is beautiful but unreal.

A MAN AND HIS DOG. By Thomas
Mann. Alfred A. Knopf; New
York. 1930.
This book is no more or less than
its title indicates. There are no
characters other than (he man and
his dog, for other people are merely
mentioned and they have no im
portance in the story.
There is, properly speaking, no
plot. The book is a series of remini
scences about the author's compan
ionship with his dog and he does
not seem to be concerned with the
order in which he set:; down the in
cidents.
The dog is a sturdy mongrel ter
rier who, while he does not possess
a number of desirable virtues, is
contrasted favorably with the aris
tocratic collies who preceded him.
Occasional philosophic remarks
are interesting. Watching the dog
chase mice, the author remarks, "is
i not fear only an intensified feeling
j for life? If no Bashan existed, the
j little mouse would very likely be
bored to death." And "How beauti
ful it is, how edifying to see a liv
i ing creature unfolding all its forces
in some supi*eme effort."
But such things are not the cause
for the existence of the book. It is
1 an unambitious, simple attempt to
describe something of beauty, and
it is not unsuccessful. —E. E. W.

LADY OF DAYLIGHT. By G. IYI.
Attenborough. Stokes, New
York. 1930. (Al the Palo Alto
Book Store.)
"Lady of Daylight" is the tale of
a very charming English lady, but
unfortunately while it makes de
lightful reading, it is extremely un
convincing. Ladies such as Dianeme
Dainty, faultless in beauty and
character and possessed of an un
limited culture and wit are hardly
probable. Perhaps, however, such a
book as this may serve as a relief
from volume after volume of ultra
realistic trash.
The plot is simple. G. M. Atten
borough describes Dianeme's lile,
her early marriage, the death of her
young husband, the upbringing ol
her son, in fact a not unusual life
of on English gentlewoman. The
war is lightly touched upon. There
are scenes of Oxford and of Au
vergne and the Basque country,
beautifully done. The author's
background in French literature and
history is remarkable.
The style and execution of Lady
of Daylight is finished. It is rare
that one has the chance to read
such a polished dialogue; while
