As expected, the 9:5G pulled into
Palo Alto yesterday morning, and
discharged an avalanche of brown
hats, under which members of the
Stanford varsity were cleverly con
cealed. To add the proper atmos
phere of welcome to our metropolis,
there were lour taxis on hand, the
drivers looking unusually hopeful.
They had apparently neglected to
read the football scores.
Stanford's own William Jen
' nings Bryan (shall we guess
who?) held a mass of excited
students spellbound before the
Library steps. All in all, it was
a glorious day for those unfor
tunates who had ten o'clocks.
The campus, believe it or not, is
infested with the form of animal
| life described by the press as a
I "Peeping Tom." This particular spe
cimen has been haunting a certain
sorority house. Last night, one of
the "sisters" felt the need of con
versation, and unexpectedly threw
up the window to speak to him in
true Christian fashion. Peering
Peter left hurriedly. Wonder why?
YY e're told that the anatomy
lab. has acquired thirty new
corpses to work on. YVe always

thought something useful should
he done with the victims of auto
accidents on the peninsula.
According to report, the city of
Hanover, Germany, rents billboard
space on its street corners where
couples can.make dates by leaving
messages for each other. This idea
has limitless possibilitiesâ€”and then,
on the other hand, we wonder if too
many messages might not go in the
same direction, here on campus.
University of California students
this week are spending the first ten
minutes of each class hour in sing
ing college songs. That is to say,
you get "All Hail, Blue and Gold,"
in Econ. 1, "Hail, California" in the
English class for which you've made
no preparation, and "Big C" for any
crumby recitation . . .
In a copy of the Daily Palo Alto
for October 10, 1892, we read: "At
a regular meeting of the freshman
class a report from the committee
on class yells resulted in the adop
tion of the following:
"Rah, Rah, Ru,
Rah, Rah, Rix,
MDCCCXCVI!"
Not a lot of fire, exactly, but oh!
did they know their Roman nu
merals?
