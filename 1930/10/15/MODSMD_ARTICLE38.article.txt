They do things in a big way over
across the bay at California. They
have a "clock tower" at least five
times as large as ours; and now they
are distributing dance tickets, not at
lan ordinary box-office, but by
broadcasting them from a flying air
plane.
We study in study-rooms; lecture
in lecture-halls; bathe in bath-
I rooms; at the University of Roches
ter the women will smoke in a
smoking-room; and now a hotel
near the University of Minnesota
offex-s a "Romance Room."
We imagine, if we are to be
lieve in modern tendencies, that
one would romance in a ro
mance-room.
A study conducted by Columbia
University revealed that fat girls
and thin girls have little opportunity
for student office and inhabit the
library as the result. We suppose
| that the fat ones should reach for
a certain cigarette and the thin ones
should reach for a "sweet."
The result being, it would seem,
that all girls would acquire the cor
rect weight, and then be elected to
student body offices. Then the "lib"
would be cleared of all distracting
influences.
Some people wonder how
U.C.L.A. can suffer lop-sided
football defeats at the hands of
many schools, and come hack
next season for more.
Perhaps these people would stop
1 wondering if they knew that in
scribed over one of U.C.L.A.'s
arches is the saying, "NOTHING IS
TOO WONDERFUL TO BE TRUE."
Most likely the Bruins honestly be
lieve that epigram in relation to
football results.
The editor of the Washington
State College paper gives as a
reason for unemployment the
use of modern machinery. He
shows that whereas one man
could only make 4ft light bulhs
a day, a machine can now pro
duce 7:{,<><lft in the same time.
But the editor forgets that mod
i ern methods take up the saving.
In the days of the horse and buggy,
it took a fellow one hour to drive
the girl-friend to a dance. Now with
cars going CO m.p.h., it still takes
one hour.
