# GRIDMEN WORK OVERTIME WITH AID OF LIGHTS
## Warner Smooths Offensive Weaknesses in Long Scrimmage TANDY NOT IN UNIFORM 
### Len Kullmann 
Beneath the glow of the incan
descents, Coach Pop Warner last
night put the Stanford varsity
through a prolonged workout last
ing until well after 6 o'clock. It was
the first time since the lights were
installed two weeks ago that they
have been used.
Scrimmage between the first and
second teams found Warner ironing
out wrinkles in the offense as fast
as they appeared, while the remain
der of the squad found employment
running through plays in semi
darkness against the dummy lines
men.
Tandy Out
Captain Ray Tandy, whose in
jured knee will probably keep him
out of Saturday's clash with Oregon
State, was forced to watch practice
from the sidelines. Tandy was not
in football togs. The Cards remain
ing cripples, Caglieri and Bardin,
were both in uniform and ran
through plays before scrimmage.
Neither was used in the scrimmage,
however.
Indicating that the same team
which started against Minnesota
will take the field against the
Orangemen Saturday, Warner had
the following men on the first team
last night: ends, Doub and Neill;
tackles, Bogue and Ehrhorn; guards,
Dawson and Hand; center, Taylor;
quarterback, Hillman; halfbacks,
Moffatt and Clark; fullback, Rothert.
Second Team
Opposing theÂ§e men were K. Al
bertson and Bush, ends; George
Grey and Laborde, tackles; McLeod
and Dohrmann, guards; M. Albert
son, center; quarterback, Allen;
halfbacks, Rintala and Wilson; full
back, Simkins.
Henri Laborde and Norm McLeod
proved to be the chief obstacles to
the smooth-running of the first
team's plays, Laborde in particular
crashing through the line frequently
to pull down ball-carriers. Moffatt,
as usual, flashed brilliantly on of
fense, although he appeared to have
trouble in hanging on to the ball.
Secret practice was in order last
night, and Warner will probably de
mand privacy until the Southern
California game has been written
into the record books. Both Warner
and the squad have completely re
covered from any gloom they may
have felt after the conclusion of the
Gopher tilt, and the men are mov
ing forward under full speed ahead
in preparation for the encounter
with the men of Schissler.
That 40-7 trouncing the Cardinals
handed out to the Beavers a year
ago has not been forgotten, and
Stanford supporters will find a fight
ing outfit facing the Warnermen
Saturday. At the start of the pres
ent season, Schissler was quoted as
having the best material he had
ever had. Although the Orangemen
have since been defeated by the
Trojans, Schisslcr's remark still
stands, and the Beaver mentor will
be pointing for Warner and the
Redshirts this season.
