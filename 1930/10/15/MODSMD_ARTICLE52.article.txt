"ACCEPTED RULINGS"
In that little book bearing the
!e "Spaulding's Official Intercolle
ite Football Guide for 1930,"' there
e many things fearful and won
rful tu behold. Others have com
nted upon the picture of the 1929
)tie Dame (or is it New Domin
i?) football team minus Elder,
uideo, Brill, Cannon, and numer
s others of note, but there re
ams much more worthy of inen
>n.
On page 44, the reader may see
e following: Team A throws a
ivvard pass from the field of play
(o the end /one which is caught
' a player of Team It, who at
mpts to run hut is tackled and
>\vned in the end zone. Captain of
am A claims a safety. Killing:
uichhack.
Also on the same page, is: Team
kicks off and the ball rolls into
e end zone after having been
uched in the field of play by a
ember of Team B (no impetus
ing added by this action). Player
team B picks up ball in the end
'lie and starts to run, but is
ckled before reaching the goal
le. Captain of Team A claims
I'ety. Ruling: Touchback.
In a word, if the impetus which
n( the ball over the goal line dur
g a football game is furnished by
e advancing team, and the de
iidimr team attempts to run with
e hall and is tackled before reach
g the goal line, a touchback is
ored and the hall is returned to
e 20-yard line just as though the
ill had been grounded behind the
>al line.
Those epidemics of chills and
vers which chase up and down
e spines of numerous stadium
lers on Saturday afternoons
ould be considerably lessened by
is ruling. But the justice of such
decision may be questioned,
lould a man intercept a pass be
nd his own goal line, it would
>pear that he considers it possible
run the ball back past the 20-
ird line, or else he would ground
e pass.
Therefore, the man who attempts
run an intercepted pass out from
•hind his own goal line is gam
ing on gaining yardage, without
ly penalty being attached to his
ilure to reach recognized playing
rritory. Such a lack of fine for
•ckless running with the ball may
l'er opportunities for spectacular
ins, but it also offers a chance for
•ads-up play. It is thus more ad
intageous for a team to permit a
an to advance the ball just past
e goal line than to stop him be
nd the line.
Cy Leland of Texas Christian Col
ge deserves some mention in the
all of Fame for the record chrom
ed after his name during the
ason of 1929. According to the
cord book, Leland won no less
an three games for his Alma
ater by long runs against the Uni
•rsity of Texas, Baylor, and Texas
? crips
Iceland's record is: Ran back kick
; 95 yards to touchdown against
e University of Texas to win a
-12 game; ran back a punt 911
rtls to a touchdown to win from
lylor; scored two touchdowns to
feat Texas Aggies on 50-yard 112
us from scrimmage; and scored
runs of 70, 75, and 75 yards from
rinunage, respectively, against
ijlor and Simmons.
The longest run on record
hieved during the Stanford-Cali
-nia games goes to the credit of
lerman. of California, who in 1902
n back a punt 105 y&rds to a
jchdown. Harold "Red" Grange
s written his name no less than
le times on the record book for
ig runs. His is the most frequent
me to appear in the record of
nous runs. —L. K., Jr.
