# Junior College Defeats Cardinal Soccer Squad
## SOCCERITES DROP CONFERENCE TILT TO SAN MATEANS Superior Offensive Attack, Evidenced by Visitors, Proves Baffling 
### 
| San Mateo Junior College soccer
| men displayed a superior offense to
; that of the Stanford varsity yester
day afternoon, and in consequence
emerged victor in .the first game of
the California Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference schedule by a 2-1 score.
Coach Harry Maloney's Cardinals
| played on even terms with the in
| vading San Mateans.in the first half
! and in the latter part of the second
j half, but were held firmly in check
i during the first part of the second
; period long enough for their op-
J ponents to put over the winning
I goal.
Defensively Stanford played.a fine
! game throughout, and lost only
through lack of a consistent attack.
Each team scored once in the first
half, Irguidi of the junior college
tallying first with a nice short kick,
made as he was falling. The Card
inal inside right, Nichols, evened the
count a little later with a goal from
five yards out.
The early stages of the contest
were a see-saw with neither eleven
gaining any advantage, but toward
the end of the period San Mateo
held the play mainly in Stanford
territory.
Starting strongly after the inter
mission, the jaysee men drove the
Cards back against their goal and
kept on driving in until they were
rewarded with the deciding score
which came as the result of a cor
ner shot. San Mateo held command
of the situation for the next 20 min
utes and made the Stanford for
wards look weak and ineffective.
Within about 10 minutes of the
final whistle Maloney's men launched
a desperate attack which almost
gained them a tying score. They
swept down the field again and
again only to be halted in front of
the goal. At the end of one of those
drives Bill Nichols, who played
bang-up soccer all the way, drove
a beautiful long kick into the net
from directly in front of it, but the
score didn't count because Stanford
was off-side.
The junior college team threat
ened to score again, particularly on
two penalty kicks, and was not dis
organized by the Stanford attack.
However, the Cards kept pushing
and were dangerous right up to the
finish.
A great deal of rough play marked
the contest, both elevens being of
fenders. Viguie, San Mateo center
forward, collided with Lynden, Stan
ford halfback, while trying to reach
the ball and received a bad cut on
the forehead. He was removed from
the game. Lynden was given first
aid and remained on the field. At
the same time Christensen, Card
center half, had his jaw dislocated.
Maloney did some emergency work,
however, and shoved it back into
place, so Christensen continued to
play.
It was Christensen and Nichols
who were the mainstays of the
Stanford offense: they did yeoman
work from start to finish. Dalton,
Burns, and Webster proved them
selves a defensive trio of high calibre
by their play at the fullback and
goal positions. They were largely
responsible for holding the invad
ers to only two goals.
