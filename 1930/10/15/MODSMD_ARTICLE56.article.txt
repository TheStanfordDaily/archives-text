# THE 						MYSTIC NUMBER

Arc you superstitious? Do you
walk around ladders, shy at black
cats, and moan with fear when you
spill salt? Does the mystic number
13 fill you with foreboding, and do
your teeth positively chatter when
you find the thirteenth of the month
coming on a Friday? Then consider
the case of Capt. Frank Hawks, the
famous aviator, and Bobby Jones,
the even more famous golfer. Both
of these noted sportsmen are super
stitious, but the number 13 has no
terrors for them. Captain Hawks
calls his plane Texaco No. 13. H ; s
Department of Commerce license is
NR1313, and he chose the thirteenth
of the month to make one of the
most spectacular flights in the his
tory of aviation. Hawks crossed the
continent on August 13 from Los
Angeles to New York in twelve
hours and twenty-five minutes,
breaking Lindbergh's record. No,
number 13 didn't hpodoo him any!
And do you think the fact that,
to win his fourth major crown in
one year and set an almost impos
sible golf record, Bobby Jones was
also after the thirteenth major
championship of his career jinxed
the Atlanta wizard in any way? To
the contrary the U.S. amateur
tournament at Merion recently was
one of the easiest that Bobby ever
waded through to victory.
Now consider the case of Hank
Bruder, captain of the Northwestern.
University Wildcats. Hank's four
teen points (no relation to Woodrow
Wilson's) defeated Tulane at Evan
ston on October 4, and everyone is
pulling for this fine back to have a
good year, after t\\ f o seasons during
which injuries have prevented him
from reaching the glory his ability
entitles him to. He broke his leg
against Wisconsin last year, but
hopes that the number 13 will keep
him free from injury during 1930.
The mystic number, however, has
been bad luck to others in sports.
The gallant Major Seagrave came
to a tragic and spectacular end on
Friday, June 13, and Jack Sharkey

turned in one of the most disap
pointing fights of his career on Fri
day, January 13, 1928, against Tom
Heeney.
