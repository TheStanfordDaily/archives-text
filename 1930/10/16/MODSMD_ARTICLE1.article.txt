# CARDS DRILLED ON OFFENSE IN LONG PRACTICE
## Rintala Runs Wild In Last Night Session; Thirds Scrimmage Seconds CAGLIERI IN SUIT AGAIN 
### Len Kallmann 
Twisting and whirling, a helmeted
figure with an elusive side-step and
an iron straight-arm furnished the
chief thrills for a select audience
last night behind that familiar green
fence which shields Pop Warner and
the Stanford varsity from prying
eyes. The whirling dervish was none
other than Rudy Rintala, second
.string left half.
Again the electric lights were
called into play last night, and
scrimmage detained various mem
bers of the varsity roster on the
practice field until a late hour while
Warner drilled his men on of
fensive plays.
Second String
Second and third string men per
formed most of the work last night.
Mar Albertson at center headed an
offensive squad composed of Mc-
Leod and Dohrmann, guards; Bogue
and Laborde, tackles; Tyler and
Bush, ends; Allen, quarterback;
Rintala and Wilson, halves; and
Simkins, fullback.
Opposed to Rambling Rudie and
his crew were Wittenau and Colvin,
ends; Nellie Gray and Burke,
tackles; Hunt and Hulen, guards;
Marks, center; Winnek, quarterback;
Hardy and Campbell, halfbacks;
and Caddel, fullback.
Early in the afternoon, Warner
gave Caglieri his first touch of
scrimmage this week against the
Grays. With Caglieri was a backfield
composed of Hardy, Simkins, and
Winnek; the line held Craig and
Colvin, ends; Ehrhorn and Bogue,
tackles; Dawson and Hulen, guai'ds;
and Quirk, center.
Caglieri appeared fit after his lay
off since the Santa Clara game, al
though his shoulder still bothers
him, and he will probably see most
of the Oregon Slate game from the
bench. Captain Ray Tandy again
watched practice from the sidelines,
and was not in uniform. Bill Bar
din, whose trick ankle remains a
problem, took a workout last night
but did not scrimmage or run
through plays with the teams. On
(he whole the cripple club is im
proving.
