WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. (TP) â€”
United States Weather Bureau air
port observers have a simple method
of ascertaining the height of over
hanging clouds in the daytime.
They inflate a small balloon on a
scale until its weight indicates a
definite rate of ascension. It is lib
erated and the time required for it
to disappear in the clouds provides
the basis for calculating the dis
tance between the earth and clmids.
