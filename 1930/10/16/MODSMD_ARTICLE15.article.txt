# TRAFFIC ROUTING OUTLINED FOR S.C. GAME BY SKAGGS
## 
### 
At a luncheon meeting held in the
alcove room of the Union yesterday
noon, which was attended by Almon
E. Roth, A 1 Masters, Fred Frehe, and
traffic officers of towns from San
Francisco to San Jose inclusive, Col.
J. H. Skaggs, chief traffic engineer
of the state highway division, out
lined the manner of routing traffic
for the U.S.C. game.
Traffic will be routed over Bay
shore, Skyline, and El Camino Real
highways. Bayshore will be closed
to north-bound traffic from 10
o'clock in the morning to 3:30
o'clock; and to south-bound traffic
from 3:30 to 7 o'clock.
Masters expressed the hope that
people coming from San Francisco
would utilize the Skyline and desig
nated it as an excellent route to
follow.
Traffic over Dumbarton bridge
was estimated to be about 4,000
cars less than for last year's Big
Game. There were 12,000 at that
time, and the officers anticipate 8,-
000 for the U.S.C. game.
Chief of Police William J. Quinn,
San Francisco, promised the co
operation of the San Francisco po
lice in routing traffic in and out of
the city to avoid congestion points.
