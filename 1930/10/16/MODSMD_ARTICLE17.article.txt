# WISE USE OF NEW REGULATIONS MAY IMPROVE HEALTH SITUATION
##

"Although the precise functions
of the women's health committee,
recently formed under conference,
are rather vague, I have great faith
in the eventual success of that
group," stated Mary-Jane Pollock,
who was chairman of the A.W.S.
committee on regulations during the
revision of rules.
"That a committee of a rather in
definite nature should be expected
to perform as a faultless machine
during the first few weeks of its
existence is too much. But the pres
ent committee has been chosen with
great care, and wise health propa
ganda has already begun to seep
into all the women's living groups."
Although the newly adopted rules
make 2:30 o'clock leaves -on week -

! ends automatic, Miss Pollock point
;od out that house presidents and
' health chairmen should be regarded
as advisory factors in this matter,
j "They cannot make official re-
I striction of the number of such late
I leaves taken, but their disapproval
; ought to be, and undoubtedly will
j be. considered very seriously.
'T he formation of public opinion
i which will frown upon excessive
I use of special privileges is one of
! the biggest tasks of the health com
j mitt.ee," she concluded. "And with
( the spread of a sentiment favoring
| the wise use of late leaves, the gen
eral health of the five hundred
I should not only fail to decline, but
1 really show improvement. It is a
matter of evolution."
