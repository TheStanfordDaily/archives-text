## Ingalls Machine Breaks Propeller As Plane Overturns 
### 
WICHITA, Oct. 15. (yP)â€”Continued
reports of bad fiving weather be
tween Wichita and St. Louis forced
Robert Buck and Miss Laura In
galls, seeking new transcontinental
flight records, to postpone their
takeoffs until tomorrow.
The propeller of Miss Ingalls' ma
chine was broken when a sudden
gust of wind as she was landing
caught the tail of her ship and
whirled it over. Miss Ingalls was
not injured. A thorough examina
tion of the plane revealed no dam
age aside from that to the propeller,
which was immediately replaced.
Both Deny Race
Miss ingalls covered the distance
from Amarillo in two hours and 14
minutes, 15 minutes less than was
required by Buck yesterday on the
came route. Her total elapsed flying
time from Los Angeles to Wichita
is 12 hours and 13 minutes. Buck is
slightly ahead of her in total elapsed
time, having covered the distance
from the coast in 12 hours and 0
minutes.
Although both Buck and Miss In
galls deny they are racing, each
seems to be determined to be the
leader.
Buck on his arrival last night an
nounced he was "determined to beat
her back, ' and Miss Ingalls today
was quick to point out that her time
from Armillo was less than required
by Buck.
