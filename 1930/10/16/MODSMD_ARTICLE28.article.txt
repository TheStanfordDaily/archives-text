### 
AS aids in carrying on the expanding and increasingly diversified work
of Stanford University on the business and operating side, Ernest S.
Erwin, formerly auditor of the University, and Alfred L. Trowbridge,
Stanford '05, have been appointed assistant comptrollers, Comptroller
Almon E. Roth announced today.
Erwin, who is already established in his new position, will be in charge
of office management, leases, taxes, insurance, purchasing, accounting,

<band auditing, including those item
in the conduct of the University
| hospitals.
Erwin Has New Duties
Trowbridge will take up his Uni
. versity duties some time in Novem
-1 ber, as soon as he has finished work
he is now undertaking in the State
Engineer's office. His responsibili
' tics as assistant comptroller will in
clude engineering and construction
j work, subdivision development,
water problems, and general main
tenance and operating activities.
Erwin has been at Stanford since
1919, coming here as accountant at
the same time that Comptroller
Roth assumed his duties. He has
been auditor of the University since
1927.
Trowbridge, who graduated in
civil engineering, was a famous ath
lete, varsity baseball man for three
years and captain in 1905, and half
back on the famous football team
I of 1904. Since 1929 he has been with
the State Engineer's office, carrying
on water resources investigations in
the San Joaquin Valley. The time
j when he will reach Stanford will
I depend on when he finishes his re
| port on this work.
Subdivision Necessary
I An indication of the necessity of
; subdividing the supervision of dc
i tails in the comptroller's office is
i the fact that since 1919 the gross
| business of the University has more
1 than doubled, being now $4,500,000 a
! year. As a result Comptroller Roth
j has found it difficult to devote suf-
I ficient attention to new projects
which call for much planning.
There will be no change in the
| personnel or department heads on
! the comptroller's staff, the new posi
j tions being created to .{ae'JitaU; the
i business of the comptroller's office
only and not to produce any altera -
I tion in the present system othcr-
J wise.
