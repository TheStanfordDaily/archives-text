# SPEEGLE TO BE SNOB IN PLAY
## Keho And Logan To Have Important Roles 
### 
Paul Speegle, versatile campus ac
tor, is to make another appearance
October 24 as Anthony Rawson,
elder son of a wealthy Long Island
family, in ''Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh,"
witty comedy of American society
life.
Anthony is the polished, rather
snobbish, son who is easily his
father's favorite, for he upholds all
the aristocratic traditions upon
which the social ideas of his family
are based. This role of the un
trustworthy sophisticate is a new
type of vehicle for Speegle.
In direct contrast to his brother,
Geoffrey Rawson, to be portrayed
by Harry Lee Logan, is a robust,
outdoor fellow, not at ease amid
the repressive surroundings of the
Rawson country home. He has a
straight-forward manner, acquired
from days passed on his ranch in
New Mexico, and he cares very little
lor the formality which influences
the actions of the other members of
his family.
The playwright, Harry James
Smith, has shown great skill in the
variation of types of women in the
comedy. From Miss Rawson, an el
derly lady of very distinguished de
meanor and the image of caste
pride, to Mrs. de Salle, who is the
eager echo of her daughter, Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh, the characters
are distinct. The former is to be
enacted by Emeline Nollcn and the
latter, by Mina Hughes.
Mrs. Stephen Lcavitt, a young
neighbor of charming, effusive man
ner, is to be portrayed by Mary Lou
Leistner. Lucille Morgan will play
the part of Nina, the maid who is
not at all adverse to Anthony's
clandestine attentions. Each con
tributes a vital bit to the perform
ance.
The whole action of the play oc
curs in a few hours of a late sum
mer day. But in this brief time Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh, who will be en
acted by Katherine Keho, is forced
to exercise all the wit and skill she
possesses to carry herself past the
obstacles which arise in the path of
her social ambition. Her younger
sister, Violet, is her naive tool until
she develops some very definite
ideas of her own. Patty Edwards
will have the role of Violet.

his family.
The playwright, Harry James
Smith, has shown great skill in the
variation of types of women in the
comedy. From Miss Rawson, an el
derly lady of very distinguished de
meanor and the image of caste
pride, to Mrs. de Salle, who is the
eager echo of her daughter, Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh, the characters
are distinct. The former is to be
enacted by Emeline Nollcn and the
latter, by Mina Hughes.
Mrs. Stephen Lcavitt, a young
neighbor of charming, effusive man
ner, is to be portrayed by Mary Lou
Leistner. Lucille Morgan will play
the part of Nina, the maid who is
not at all adverse to Anthony's
clandestine attentions. Each con
tributes a vital bit to the perform
ance.
The whole action of the play oc
curs in a few hours of a late sum
mer day. But in this brief time Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh, who will be en
acted by Katherine Keho, is forced
to exercise all the wit and skill she
possesses to carry herself past the
obstacles which arise in the path of
her social ambition. Her younger
sister, Violet, is her naive tool until
she develops some very definite
ideas of her own. Patty Edwards
will have the role of Violet.
Paul Speegle, versatile campus ac
tor, is to make another appearance
October 24 as Anthony Rawson,
elder son of a wealthy Long Island
family, in ''Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh,"
witty comedy of American society
life.
Anthony is the polished, rather
snobbish, son who is easily his
father's favorite, for he upholds all
the aristocratic traditions upon
which the social ideas of his family
are based. This role of the un
trustworthy sophisticate is a new
type of vehicle for Speegle.
In direct contrast to his brother,
Geoffrey Rawson, to be portrayed
by Harry Lee Logan, is a robust,
outdoor fellow, not at ease amid
the repressive surroundings of the
Rawson country home. He has a
straight-forward manner, acquired
from days passed on his ranch in
New Mexico, and he cares very little
lor the formality which influences
the actions of the other members of
his family.
