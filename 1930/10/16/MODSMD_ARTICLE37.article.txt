# POLITICAL BARTER IN CLASS OFFICES
## 
### 
\ssociated students ;it the University of Wisconsin have taken a
step forward by abolishing superannuated and useless class offices.
The three lesser offices, namely: vice-president, secretary, and
treasurer were eliminated because of charges that these positions
were no longer necessary or valuable and had become mere objects
for political barter among rival campus bosses.
Although political bosses do not flourish at Stanford because
of the laissez-faire attitude of the student body toward campus
politics, further maintenance of the minor class offices is just as un
necessary and harmful here as at the Hadger institution.
Centralization of responsibility and control in the hands of the
class president should do much to boost the importance of that
position to the place it really deserves.
With twelve of the sixteen offices stricken from the class ballot
tiresome revotes which frequently confound elections may be largely
eliminated.
The dav of highly organized classes has passed. One man to
manage the affairs of bis associates is sufficient. Dead wood
should go.
