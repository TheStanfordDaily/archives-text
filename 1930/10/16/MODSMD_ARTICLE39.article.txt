## 
### 
What's tlic matter with all college rooters? asks a certain Mr.
Souza in The Chronicle's Safety Waive for October 15.
"Whenever their college loses a game in football." Souza com
plains. "tliev go around with t.i.t. eyes, offering some excuse for
their loam's loss. Yet when their team wins they become practically
unbearable with their praise. Why <!<> they always see the good
point- of their team and never the bad points and vice versa with
the 'other teams ?"
Perhaps, it is because a rooter's enthusiasm, like a mother's love,
reveals manv things that do not exist and conceals many monstro
sities that do. The Chronicle aptly inquires of Souza in the heading
to his communication. "Whv is human nature human?" A college
rooter wouldn't be a rooter unless he displayed some interest in his
team's success.
Hut the situation isn't so bad as Souza would have us to believe.
Maybe there were some t.i.t. (tears in their) eyes 011 the campus
following the Minnesota-Stanford game, but none of them peered
into The Daily office.
\s for the matter of rooters being "practically unbearable" when
their team wins, it i< The Daily's hope that the Farm will have to
endure such unbearableness several times before the end o! the 1 ( M)
football season.
