THE SPOILERS. At the Varsity
Theatre.
As a picture of the lawless life of
one of our last frontiers, the Yukon,
"The Spoilers" provides a distinct
change in the matter of background
for the love story. Gary Cooper, as
the big he-man, is just the person
to put the maximum of virile action
into the part of a born leader among
the lawless inhabitants of the Yu
kon, while Kay Johnson, although
bred in the ways of civilization,
shows a directness not out of place
against the rough surface of Alaska.
The pictures of Nome in the gold
rush days are done with an intimacy
revealing the spirit of frontier per
sonalities and codes. The lack of
triteness contributes to the tone of
the picture, which succeeds in being
real and elemental, as elemental its
the hand to hand battle between
two deadly rivals. It is a picture of
unusual interest, a good show.

FOLLOW THRU—On the New
Stanford screen.
In which the musical comedy suc
cess of a season or two back reaches
the screen nearly intact.
Nancy Carroll and Charles
"Buddy" Rogers have the leading
roles in Paramount's version, and
aside from the fact that they are
better golfers than singers, they do
very nicely.
Zelma O'Neal, Eugene Pallette,
and Jack Haley dish up the comedy
of the Brown, Desylva, and Hen
derson production in large gobs.

Miss O'Neal shines in particular,
tiding the picture over several lag
ging spots.
The highlight of the production,
as on the stage, is the dressing room
scene at the country club, a varia
tion of the venerable boudoir gag.
The story, slight and typically
musical comedy, has not been al
tered in the transition from foot-']
lights to celluloid.
Done entirely in technicolor, this !
feature is a little trying. According |
to reports from Hollywood, few j
forthcoming productions will be
done entirely in color. —L.M.C.
MICHAEL AND MARY. At the j
Alcazar Theatre, San Francisco. ]
If many of Duffy's plays this year
are as good as this one, we predict
a rosy future lor the organization.
In unmistakable contrast to some
of the Duffy shows of last spring,
"Michael and Mary" is a nicely
turned performance of clever show
manship which satisfies the most
critical theatregoer. Henry Duffy is
good as usual, and gets away with
the difficult part of being a twenty
three-year-old boy when the cur
tain rises, and ending the evening ;
as a father in his fifties.
Dale Winter (Mrs. Duffy) looks
so much better than she did last
spring tha't a murmur of surprise
runs through the audience of Duffy
ites on her appearance. The whole ,
play is cast to a perfection; Cuff the j
cop, and Mrs. Tullivant the land
lady, both are characters that would
satisfy Dickens himself. —W.H.S.
