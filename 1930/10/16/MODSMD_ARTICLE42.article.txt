HE DOESN'T CARE NOW |
The Editor, Sir:
I notice that on the applications
for game tickets there is a condi- j
tion inserted that applications had j
to be in by October 5 or they would i
be turned nown.
I think that the Stanford Board
of Athletic Control is adopting en- ;
tirely the wrong policy. The new i
move points convincingly to the .
argument that the Stanford Board j
of Athletic Control intends to profi- !
teer off the students in the future, j
If they give us only a limited time 1
to buy our tickets we will buy them j
without thinking and then have a j
few on our hands after the big j
games are over. On the other hand, !
the Board of Athletic Control will j
have the money. The tendency for j
the student is to buy his full allot- !
ment for he hasn't time to find how
many of his friends will go to the \
games. He wants as many of his |
friends to come as possible and the j
Board of Athletic Control knows
that. That is like the dog biting the !
hand that is feeding it.
I had friends who wanted to go !
to several of the big games. I was I
late hearing from them, and sent ;
my applications in late to try the i
system out. I was told I was too j
late, but that I could get the tickets j
at Wideman's or at Roos Brothers. |
The tickets can stay at Wideman's J
and Roos Bdothers for all I care. ,
I do not intend to pay the full price |
to see a game when I am paying for j
the privilege of seeing the games ,
when I pay my tuition, and I do not ]
intend to order for my friends. I j
am a loyal Stanford man as long as j
Stanford treats me right, but when j
it doesn't treat me right I do not
care how the big games go. Logic
ally, it seems as if others will fol- i
low # the like example.
Yours truly, Law '31.

ORATORIO CHORUS FULL
The Editor, Sir:
My failure to change an an- ;
nouncement issued at the beginning j

I of the term has resulted in some
' misunderstanding, so I wish to state
j that all vacancies in the Oratorio
; Chorus were more than filled at the
! first rehearsals last week. The capa
; city of the organ gallery is taxed to
t its utmost with those registered for
the "Requiem" performance on.
; Armistice Day. I have had to re
i fuse admission to many good voices,
! so this announcement is overdue.
I lam also gratified with the fine
I showing made at the first rehearsals
! of the University Choir. The Choir
j is larger than for several years past
j and the material so excellent that
j only a limited number can still be
| accepted. Due to the old "five to
j one" ratio the women are outnum
! bered, so more sopranos and altos
! can be accepted for Choir only. But
! no tenors or basses can be taken on
for either Choir or Oratorio.

that. That is like the dog biting the !
hand that is feeding it.
I had friends who wanted to go !
to several of the big games. I was I
late hearing from them, and sent ;
my applications in late to try the i
system out. I was told I was too j
late, but that I could get the tickets j
at Wideman's or at Roos Brothers. |
The tickets can stay at Wideman's J
and Roos Bdothers for all I care. ,
I do not intend to pay the full price |
to see a game when I am paying for j
the privilege of seeing the games ,
when I pay my tuition, and I do not ]
intend to order for my friends. I j
am a loyal Stanford man as long as j
Stanford treats me right, but when j
it doesn't treat me right I do not
care how the big games go. Logic

ORATORIO CHORUS FULL
The Editor, Sir:
My failure to change an an- ;
nouncement issued at the beginning j

I of the term has resulted in some
' misunderstanding, so I wish to state
j that all vacancies in the Oratorio
; Chorus were more than filled at the
! first rehearsals last week. The capa
; city of the organ gallery is taxed to
t its utmost with those registered for
the "Requiem" performance on.
; Armistice Day. I have had to re
i fuse admission to many good voices,
! so this announcement is overdue.
I lam also gratified with the fine
I showing made at the first rehearsals
! of the University Choir. The Choir
j is larger than for several years past
j and the material so excellent that
j only a limited number can still be
| accepted. Due to the old "five to
j one" ratio the women are outnum
! bered, so more sopranos and altos
! can be accepted for Choir only. But
! no tenors or basses can be taken on
for either Choir or Oratorio.
