Good news for the poor unfortun
ates among us who diet copiously,
according to doctors' orders, on
spinach, carrots, and other trouble
some vegetables intended to "build
up strength." A research specialist
at Washington State declares that it
would take 200 pounds of spinach
to give enough iron for one small
nail. Maybe that's just a boost for
the carpenters' union—or just may
be they'll discover another sandy
; vegetable to put iron in your
blood." Had your cuoumatoash to
day?
In a recent Daily we were
j made to realize the "power of
, the press" to make or break a
man (or a football team) at
will. The article mentions the
team "undergoing major lineup
operations"—and they headed it
"Many Trojans ' Hurt." Well,
they probably were, at that . . .
And may we comment that the
! San Francisco Chronicle's motto
must be "All the News that fits the
print." With a sharp eye for the
truth, the Chronicle reports as fol
, lows on the Wilbur situation: "Wil
' liam Mayo Newhall, president of the
j (Stanford) board of trustees, on
learning of President Hoover's
statement, said that in all proba
bility Wilbur's request for an exten
sion of his leave until September,

1931, would be granted." If that i
isn't fearless journalism, what is?
A committee composed of HO
police officers visited the cam
pus yesterday to make arrange- I
ments for handling traffic dur
ing football games. Yesterday
we told you that there were .'lO
new corpses in the stiff lab.
A pamphlet published in 1894
says of this University: "Tuition in j
all departments is free, and forever
free." If someone had looked into
the future of the matter, at that .
lime, what a surprise he'd have had. i
Women at the University of Cali- !
; fornia have started an emancipation
j movement, seeking a bar on campus j
which would serve them near-beer i
j and pretzels. Women on this cam
! pus can't even smoke without get
! ting a special permit beforehand • • • j
Has anyone ever told you that
gold and white were almost adopted !
! as Stanford's colors? That Stanford j
1 almost closed in 1895 because of i
lack of funds, and that Mrs. Stan- i
ford planned to sell one million j
! gallons of brandy from her ranch to |
! aid in supporting the University? i
Or that our emblem was once used
j as a trade mark for a wine dis
i tillery?
Of course, that was all long, long ;
! ago.
