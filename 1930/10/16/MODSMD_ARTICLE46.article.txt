## REINFORCEMENTS 
### 
For the past three years, Stanford
as seen cavorting about the grid
on two centers whose work left
othing more to he desired. Hal
IcCreery, as captain of the 1927
iam, was ail over the lot making
ickles and intercepting passes be
des playing a neat game on offense.
lint little was said aliout Mc-
Creery's departure when a
husky chap bearing number 21
moved into the picture. In fact,
Walt Ileinecke so completely
filled that picture it was impos
sible to see how anyone else had
done*the job before be had ar
rived on the scene. For two
years Walter was in the center
of things, and all the touch
downs scored against Stanford
on line plays during that period
can be numbered on one hand.
But like everything else coll
ected with college football, _ a
hange had to come. Heinecke com
leted his term of office, and an
mbitious lad by the name of Perry
'aylor moved in. People dancing
•itli tears in their eyes prepared to
led them for Stanford. Hadn't she
),st an all-American center?
Stanford bad lost an all-
American center, but he was
replaced by a very hard hotn
hre. Sixty minutes of football
be played against as big a line
as can be found in these United
States last Saturday, and the
weather in the Middle West was
no less than "unusual."
Sitting on the bench Saturday,
xcept for moments when he
/armed up to go into the game,
as Mar Albertson. Now Albertson
A'ists a neat end-over-end pass
imself when called upon to do so,
ut the quality of play Perry dis
layed against the Gophers was
ueh that Warner did not feel called
pon to make any substitution.
On the varsity roster after
number 7, the reader may ob
serve the name "Charles Elir
horn." At the start of the year,
this elongated tackle was men
tioned as an understudy for the
Stanford captain, It. Elmer
Tandy. Ehrhorn's name could
be found in the starting line
ups of the early games, and his
work brought a modicum of
praiso.
But one sunny afternoon, Captain
left the game rather abruptly.
!ay was already the possessor of
>ne trick knee, the right one, but
iow he was fixed up in splendid
hape. His left knee was sadly out
>112 commission, too, and the Stan
ord leader has since been forced
o view games from the player's
>cnch.
Stepping into the breach left
vacant by Tandy, Ehrhorn also
stepped into the attention of
opposing scouts. For the first
three plays, Minnesota threw
everything she had at Chuck's
tackle. Interference thundered
out, the ball-carrier tagged
along, but plays piled up at the
line of scrimmage. And down at
the bottom of the pile reposed
one lone, long Redshirt. So the
(Jophers left right tackle alone
thereafter.
Taller than any human being has
right to be, Ehrhorn is not an
nspiring sight for kickers to be
lold, as any Olympic Club hooter
an testify. Chuck has already
docked three kicks by his lone
ome, and will cause plenty of grief
or opposing punters before this
eason has passed.
Meanwhile Tandy is forced to sit
in the bench, and when he does
day again, he will be forced to play
ootball to keep Moiis. Ehrhorn
juietly on the sidelines. For Ehr
lorn is dynamite in one large por
ion, and ihe right side of the line
s not weakened by his presence.

this elongated tackle was men
tioned as an understudy for the
Stanford captain, It. Elmer
Tandy. Ehrhorn's name could
be found in the starting line
ups of the early games, and his
work brought a modicum of
praiso.
But one sunny afternoon, Captain
left the game rather abruptly.
!ay was already the possessor of
>ne trick knee, the right one, but
iow he was fixed up in splendid
hape. His left knee was sadly out
>112 commission, too, and the Stan
ord leader has since been forced
o view games from the player's
>cnch.
Stepping into the breach left
vacant by Tandy, Ehrhorn also
stepped into the attention of
opposing scouts. For the first
three plays, Minnesota threw
everything she had at Chuck's
tackle. Interference thundered
out, the ball-carrier tagged
along, but plays piled up at the
line of scrimmage. And down at
the bottom of the pile reposed
one lone, long Redshirt. So the
(Jophers left right tackle alone
thereafter.
Taller than any human being has
right to be, Ehrhorn is not an
nspiring sight for kickers to be
lold, as any Olympic Club hooter
an testify. Chuck has already
docked three kicks by his lone
ome, and will cause plenty of grief
or opposing punters before this
eason has passed.
Meanwhile Tandy is forced to sit
in the bench, and when he does
day again, he will be forced to play
ootball to keep Moiis. Ehrhorn
juietly on the sidelines. For Ehr
lorn is dynamite in one large por
ion, and ihe right side of the line
s not weakened by his presence.

For the past three years, Stanford
as seen cavorting about the grid
on two centers whose work left
othing more to he desired. Hal

iam, was ail over the lot making
ickles and intercepting passes be
des playing a neat game on offense.
lint little was said aliout Mc-
Creery's departure when a
husky chap bearing number 21
moved into the picture. In fact,
Walt Ileinecke so completely
filled that picture it was impos
sible to see how anyone else had
done*the job before be had ar
rived on the scene. For two
years Walter was in the center
of things, and all the touch
downs scored against Stanford
on line plays during that period
can be numbered on one hand.
But like everything else coll
ected with college football, _ a
hange had to come. Heinecke com

'aylor moved in. People dancing
