# Babe Gridmen Head South
## FRESHMAN ELEVEN ENTRAINS TONIGHT TO TACKLE BRUINS U.C.L.A. Babes Undefeated Starting Lineup For Cards Named 
### Stewart Crawford 
Twenty-five strong, a band of
Card yearling gridmen will entrain
tonight at 8:30 o'clock bound for the
Southland to tangle with the un
defeated U.C.L.A. babe eleven Sat
urday on its home field at West
wood.
The tentative starting lineup as
announced yesterday by Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw is as follows:
Maentz, left half; White, right half;
Anderson, full; Hillman, quarter;
Edelen, left end; Palamountain, left
tackle; Tarver, left guard; Kantzner,
center; Alden, right guard; Tatum,
right tackle; Monsalve, right end.
May Change Lineup
Bradshaw is still uncertain about
the left tackle and fullback posi
tions, and the starting gun may find
Lyman in the tackle berth in place
of Palamountain, or Lipscomb play
ing full instead of Anderson.
Others of Bradshaw's warriors to
make the trip are Packard, Miller,
Torrence, Sanderson, Goodrich,
Topping, Miles, Gould, Freeman,
Hanna, Spencer, and Massey.
The yearling mentor hardly knows
what to expect when, the battle be
gins Saturday, having little oppor
tunity to check comparative scores,
since the Uclans have played none
of the teams encountered by his
! gridders.
Strength Unknown
Though the Southern outfit has
gone through three games unde
feated, it is difficult to find out the
calibre of the teams it has overrun.
The U.C.L.A. babes downed Glen
dale J.C. 9-7, Pasadena J.C. 13-0,
and the Oneonta Military Academy
14-6.
Robb at half, and Keebles at full
i for the Uclans will be marked men
Saturday, the latter having averaged
a four-yard gain on each try'at the
j line of the Oneonta eleven.
Coach Bradshaw's gridmen have
showed unexpected strength so far
this season in going through three
games undefeated. Though they
were tied by the Sacramento J.C.
eleven at 13-13 in their first start,
they caem back the following week
to down the highly touted Santa
Clara freshmen by a 7-6 count. The
Cards' 24-0 win over the Armstrong
Business College last week proved
an easy victory.
Though Bradshaw can figure a
win on paper, he expects a plenty
! tough battle Saturday. Not only will
the Bruins be playing on their home
field, but it is the best yearling
eleven that institution has ever
j turned out, and they are all pepped
I up about it.
