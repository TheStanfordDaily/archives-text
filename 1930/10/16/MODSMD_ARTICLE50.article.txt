' Although considerable improve
' ment is noted by Smith in the de
fense of the babes, there is still
much work to be done, he says. The

none of the forward positions have
been definitely assigned to any one
i member of the squad, with the ex
ception of center forward, where
Hern appears to have entrenched
himself.
Marx at goal, and Maino and
Irons at fullback, look pretty strong

which started against Commerce
High last week will be made for
this coming encounter with Lowell,
