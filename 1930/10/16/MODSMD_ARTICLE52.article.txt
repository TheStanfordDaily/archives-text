# TICKETS FOR U.S.C. GAME WILL REACH SUBSCRIBERS TODAY
## 
### 
Tickets to the Stanford-U.S.C.
game will be in the mails today
was the announcement made yes
terday by W. C. Werry, University
postmaster.
Students must bring the yellow
slip to the registry window in order
to claim their tickets. These notices
are as good as gold, and care should
be taken not to lose them, according
to Werry.
Anyone not receiving the yellow
registry notice need not worry for
a day or so as the incomplete ad
dresses handed in by some of the
students necessitate directory ser
vice. If tickets are not received by
the end of the week students are
advised to investigate the matter. â€¢
