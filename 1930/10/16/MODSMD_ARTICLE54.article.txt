# CARD SOCCERMEN MEET ROVER BOYS IN NEXT CONTEST
## Maloney Drills Redshirts On Offensive Plays; Defense Strong 
### 
With a mighty tough game com
ing up Saturday in the persons of
the Rover team from San Francisco,
Coach Harry Maloney will get down
to work this afternoon in an effort
to develop an offense in his soccer
varsity that will be capable of rol
ling up a few goals on its oppon
ents.
Stanford dropped a contest to San
Mateo Junior College Tuesday,
chiefly through the inability of the
forwards to click, and Maloney in
tends to remedy that defect if pos
sible.
He gave the front line men a light
workout on passing attack yesterday
afternoon and let most of the squad
rest, but today he will have a regu
lar practice, concentrating chiefly on
offensive tactics.
Defense Looks Good
The defense functioned perfectly
against San Mateo, and Maloney de
clared yesterday that he had no
more worries of any sort about the
strength of his goal guard, fullback,
and halfback positions. Beautiful
kicks out of danger by Dalton and
Burns at full and some fine stops
by Goal-keeper Webster were fea
tures of the junior college game.
On the other hand the forwards
seemed unable to hold the ball
when it was fed to them, and the
San Mateans were able to nip most
of the Card attacks in the bud.
When they did succeed in carrying
the ball down the field hard kicking
and drive were more in evidence
than teamplay. The passes were of
ten intercepted, and, perhaps in con
sequence of this, the players had a
tendency to get by the defensive
men single-handed.
