SANTA ANA. Oct. 15. (/P) â€” A
whale stranded in Santa Ana (it was
stuffed and embalmed) caused a
$20,000 damage suit to bo filed in
the U.S. District Court at Los An
geles. F. W. Fowzer and others
owned the whale. They wanted to
ship it to San Diego for exhibition,
purposes. The railroad carted it as
far as Santa Ana, then side-tracked
it, saying there was no freight
schedule on whales. So the whale
lay high and dry waiting for some
one to provide a rate.
