# WILBUR FLAYED FOR OCCUPYING DUAL POSITIONS
## Director Calls Attention To Stanford's Large Bond Investment REPLACEMENT IS DUE 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (/P).â€”
Secretary Wilbur's chairmanship of
Iho federal power commission while
he remains president of Stanford
University was criticized today by
Mercer G. Johnston, director of the
people's legislative service.
Johnston asserted Stanford has
about $7,000,000 invested in public
utilities bonds, many of them issued
by companies "that have been or
re now seeking grand favors" from
the power commission.
Under an act of the last congress
the commission is to be reorganized,
live members appointed by the
president replacing the secretaries
of interior, war and agriculture who
now constitute the membership.
Johnston's Statement
Johnston's statement declared that
Dr. Wilbur, "thanks to the extraor
dinary generosity of the board of
trustees," continues to draw the sal
ary, reputed to be $20,000 annually,
and remains in possession of the
presidential mansion on the campus.
"Composite photographs of the
members of the Stanford board and
of a regional committee of the Na
tional Electric Light Association
would show a striking resemblance,"
he says.
Dr. Wilbur, points out Johnston, is
executive head of the Federal Power
Commission, its acting chairman, and
the man who defines its policies. He
is responsible for the retention of
Executive Secretary Frank E. Bon
ner, "who was recommended for the
key position by representatives of
public utilities with whom Wilbur
is closely affiliated."
Of Bonner, Johnston says: "Many
large investments of Secretary Wil
bur as president of Stanford are in
the very public utilities now seeking
grand favors from the Federal
Power Commission, and in whose
defense Executive Secretary Bonner
has been very zealous.
Mentions Two
' Two of these may be mentioned
as having special significance at this
time:
"First, the Alabama Power Co.,
which has led the fight to grab the
$125,000,000 public development at
Muscle Shoals.
"Second, the Appalachian Electric
Power Co. (subsidiary of Electric
Bond & Share Co.), in whose behalf
Attorney General Mitchell (upon the
initiative of President Hoover, Stan
ford alumnus and trustee) gave an
opinion the other day that flies in
the face of precedents of more than
100 years, and threatens frustration
of the very public ends for which
the Federal Power Commission was
created.
"At its last session, Congress pro
vided for an enlarged permanent
Federal Power Commission. It only
awaits organization. This will take
place in December. Yet the zealous
Bonner, it is said, is urging the pres
ent commission, with its expiring
breath, to act irrevocably on the
inarvelously accommodating Mitchell
opinion."
