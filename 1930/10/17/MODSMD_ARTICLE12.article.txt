horse. It kicked, knocking out a
plate glass window in a drug store.
Petition Ignored
Engdahl started to < read a long
petition on unemployment, ignoring
the mayor's request that he defer
his statement. The mayor explained
he was in poor health and wished
to leave as soon as possible.
"Then let some one else take your
place," Engdahl suggested.
"Only the people can do that, and
it won't be done by mob rule,"
Walker replied. "Don't think you
can bully this meeting. You can't do
it."
"Later, another Communist tried
to read the petition. The mayor ex
plained the committee would be
given an opportunity to present its
case later and the Communist sat
down."

in the budget for the police depart- |
ment, on the ground the police were j
brutal to the working class.
The delegation was pushed down- )
stairs, and in the melee Nesen was
badly beaten. The whole delegation
was held for questioning.
The disorders in the park, broke
out when J. Louis Engdahl, secre
tary of the International Labor De
fense and candidate for lieutenant
governor, who was head of the dele
gation to the board of estimate, was
ejected from the building.
Speech Stopped
Engdahl's efforts to make a speech
were stopped and, in the confusion
a young woman jabbed a pin into
the flanks of a mounted policeman's
horse. It kicked, knocking out a
plate glass window in a drug store.
Petition Ignored
Engdahl started to < read a long
petition on unemployment, ignoring
the mayor's request that he defer
his statement. The mayor explained
he was in poor health and wished
to leave as soon as possible.
"Then let some one else take your
place," Engdahl suggested.
"Only the people can do that, and
it won't be done by mob rule,"
Walker replied. "Don't think you
can bully this meeting. You can't do
it."
"Later, another Communist tried
to read the petition. The mayor ex
plained the committee would be
given an opportunity to present its
case later and the Communist sat
down."
