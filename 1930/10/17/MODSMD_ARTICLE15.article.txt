# GUARD TROY GRID DUCATS SAYS IRWIN
## Thefts And Losses Of Tickets Should Be Reported 
### 
Students are warned to see that
their football game tickets are not
stolen from their rooms before the
games, as was the case with many
seat-holders in previous year, ac
cording to an announcement by Jake
Irwin, head of the ticket depart
ment of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Of the 137 tickets stolen before the
U.S.C. game last year, none were
recovered and all but twelve were
used at the game by somebody other
than the person who had bought
them. According to the district at
torney of San Jose County, nothing
can be done if some person other
than the buyer of the tickets comes
to the game and claims seats.
Only if the seats are unoccupied
can a person who has lost his ticket
hope to receive admission. Students
whose tickets are lost or stolen
should report the loss to the ticket
department.
In former years the tickets were
stolen largely from men living in the
dormitories and fraternities. The
thieves gained admission and
searched the rooms while the stu
dents were at rallies.
