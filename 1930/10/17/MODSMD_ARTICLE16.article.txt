PITTSBURGH. Oct. 16. (/P> —
"This monkey business in the coun
ty detective bui'cau is going to stop,"
says Chief George Murren, but he's
not sure how he's going to stop it.
The "business" started several
days ago, when Nick, a big Borneo
monkey with a carnival, bit some
admirers. He was seized by a couple
of detectives and, in turn, seized
them—with his teeth. Turned over
to the district attorney's office, he
bit several attaches there and got
sent back to the dctectives. They
told a pet shop keeper to keep him.
Yesterday the shop keeper blus
tered into Murren's office.
His monkey business was ruined,
he shouted. Nick had nicked half
a dozen customers.
And then he handed Murren a bill
for Nick's board, along with what
amounted to an eviction notice.
Today Murren said he would call
up other pet shops, the zoo, or
maybe the penitentiary.
