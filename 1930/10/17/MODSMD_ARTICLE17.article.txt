# LARGE CROWD SEES ENGLISH CLUB GIVE RUSSIAN PHOTOPLAY
## 
### 
Before a well-filled house, "Tsar
Ivan the Terrible," sombre picturi
zation of the old Russian regime,
was presented last night in the As
sembly Hall as the first of a series
of unusual films to be sponsored by
the English Club.
The film depicts the old monarchy
in the worst light, and according to
Professor Lanz of the Slavic Litera
ture department is influenced by
Soviet propaganda. Ivan himself is
somewhat misrepresented. Although
Ivan was reared amid such scenes
of arrogance and violence that his
mind was permanently impaired, he
was far from the consistently malig
nant figure that this film made him
out.
A short German film, preceding
the feature picture, gave the almost
self-evident facts upon which Ein
stein bases his famous theory of
relativity of motion, size, speed,
time, direction, and motion.
