##

"The lockout destiny of many fu
ture Five Hundreds rests in the
hands of the women registered in
Stanford this year," declared Louise
Artz, president of W.A.A., upon be
ing questioned as to the ultimate
importance of the new social regu- i
lations.
"After a long struggle, the women
students have at last secured per
mission from the administration to
put more lenient rules on trial for
one year. This year of 1930-31 is a
crucial one, as it is our one chance
to justify our demands, and to in
sure more freedom to the Stanford
women who are to come in the fu
ture.
"Whether the classes of the late

'30's and ' 10's will have returned to
the old 10:30 o'clock rules, depends
upon our use of the present trial
system.
"As we owe a debt of gratitude
to those women who agitated for
these revisions before us, so do we
also owe a debt of duty to the un
known generations to come. Stan
ford feminine posterity deserves 'a
break.' It is not for us of the present
to abuse our privileges to the exclu
sion of those who will follow us.
"I have conlidence that the pres
ent Five Hundred will meet this
responsibility to the future genera
tions," she concluded. "They are
doing their share in other things,
and should not fall in this all-im
portant matter <>l social regulations."
