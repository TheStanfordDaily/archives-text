WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (/IV-
Suspicious circumstances surround
ing a $200,000 fire on the battleship
Colorado last June are being in
vestigated by the Navy Department.
Secretary Adams said today,
"Events surrounding the fire led us
to believe that there might have
been some tampering," and that
"when any suspicion arises a
thorough investigation is conducted.'
The investigation was disclosed by
the navy secretary today in com
menting on published reports that
the department believed the fire was
started deliberately. Adams char
acterized the reports as "exagger
ated."
Fire Breaks Out
Fire broke out on the Colorado on
June 2 while the battleship was at
Colon awaiting passage through the
Panama Canal. It destroyed the
plotting room of the vessel and ne
cessitated expensive repairs.
The Colorado was taken to the
Brooklyn navy yard for an overhaul
which disclosed needles stuck into
the wiring system of the plotting
room. It was believed they might
have been placed there with malic
ious intent and an investigation was
ordered.
Secretary Adams denied knowl
edge of a report that a second fire
broke out on the vessel while under
going repairs at the Brooklyn navy
yard.
The investigation into the first fire
was ordered by Captain William S.
Miller, who had been in command of
the Colorado since May 22.
