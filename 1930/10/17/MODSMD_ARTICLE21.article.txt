# COLD EPIDEMIC IS USUAL FEATURE OF OPENING OF SCHOOL
## 
### 
The epidemic of colds now on the
campus is a usual feature of the
opening of school, according to Dr.
Bertha Dyment, women's medical
advisor.
"Every year there are more colds
treated at the beginning of fall quar
ter than at any other time. Colds
are taken by personal contact which
is inevitable on a campus." However,
Dr. Dyment believes, "it is neces
sary that students with colds keep
away from crowds and social af
fairs. Large classes, theatres, and
social functions of all kinds are the
best places to spread or catch a
cold."
Approximately 100 colds have
been treated so far by the women's
medical office.
Colds should be watched carefully,
the office advises, for several have
already developed into influenza
and they may also be a symptom
of poliomylitis.
