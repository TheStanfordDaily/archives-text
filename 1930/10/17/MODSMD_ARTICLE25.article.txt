# COACH WARNER SPRINGS SURPRISE, SHIFTS TEAM FOR OREGON STATE TILT
## Rothert, Simkins, Caddel, and Rintala Will Compose Stanford's Starting Position; Caddel Moved From Full to Right Half Position EHRHORN ONLY REGULAR INCLUDED IN LINE 
### LEN KULLMANN 
HYNAMITE exploded in large chunks at practice last night with the
announcement by Warner of the team which will start tomorrow
against Oregon State in the Rcdshirts' Conference debut. According to
the list handed out last night, the Cardinals will take the field with Don
Colvin and Carl Wittcnau at ends, George Grey and "Chuck" Ehrhorn at
tackles, Ray Hulen and Pete Heiser at guards, Mar Albertson at center,

<S>Bill Simkins as quarterback, Itudy
Rintala and Ernie Caddel at half,
and Harlow Rothert in the fullback
position.
After two nights of hard scrim -
I mage, Pop was easier on the men
i last night and put them through a
| series of miscellaneous drills and
i signal practice. For the first time
since the Santa Clara game, Cap
tain Ray Tandy appeared at foot
ball practice in moleskins, and the
Cardinal leader was able to run
through plays again.
Labordc Out
j But the return of Tandy to the
semi-active list is in part balanced
by the loss of Henri Laborde, sec
ond string tackle. Laborde suffered
a twisted knee during Wednesday
night's practice, and will be out of
j the game for at least a week. While
| Tandy is improving, the Cards will
play without the services of their
captain tomorrow, for Warner will
not risk the loss of the Stanford
chieftain before the U.S.C. game.
Caglieri and Bardin both ran
through plays at practice last night,
and although they may see service
against Oregon State, it is doubtful
if they will be sent in at all tomor
row except during the closing min
j utes of the fray.
Warner's starting backfield makes
good a threat to shift Caddel from
fullback to half, springs a surprise
in the appearance of Simkins at
quarterback, and includes Rudy
1 Rintala in the starting lineup for
j the first time this season. What this
quartet will unfold remains to be
seen, but on paper it appears to l>e
the goods.
Caddel Shifted
In placing Caddel at a new posi
tion, Warner admits the need for
beef in the left halfback berth. The
j newly placed half will bring the
weight of the starting backfield up
to an average of 187 pounds, and
besides the added avoirdupois, Cad
j del is as fleet-footed as any man on
I the squad. Rintala, by his flashy
showing in scrimmage during the
i week, has earned a place on the
j starting list, although he cannot be
expected to keep Moffatt on the
bench for the whole game.
While quarterback and fullback in
j the Warner system are interchange
i able, the placing of Bill Simkins in
j the close-up hitter's position comes
ias a surprise. Whether Warner is
| trying his star passer at this new
j position or instead is merely giving
l him this opportunity to battle Roth -
I ert for the fullback post is a ques
! tion which the game will solve, but
; it would be no surprise if Simkin
j new job turned out to be pcrim<
j ncnt.
I Scoring on U.S.C. with the aid of
| a long pass which brought them
j down to the Trojans' 1-yard line,
• the Beavers arc certain to take to
j the air during the game Saturday,
j A year ago the Orangemen sprung
i a surprise on the first play of the
i Stanford game, and Bill McKalip
I scored on a 40-yard pass and 25-
j yard run.
Staters Pass
