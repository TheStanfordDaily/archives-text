Down in sunny southern California Tom Pike, A.S.S.C. presi
dent, is assuaging the about-to-be-hurt pride of that glorious insti
tution. Cniversity of Southern California.
I 'ike has the task before him o faddrcssing a so-called ''good
will" assembly where all the students get up with beaming faces—
nicely washed, of course—and swear eternal allegiance to each other.
It's all done in a nice way—it's only nice enough to waste money
traveling back and forth and giving the student body president a good
time. If a good speech is made well and good—but that's about all
the good that results.
Stanford's student body president is to be commended for ex
pressing the wish that the "good-will" farce could be called off. but
out of deference to the I .S.L-. student body president he consented
to go south.
The Daim hopes such publicity-seeking student officials will
lorget themselves some day and hoard the train going in an opposite
direction.
