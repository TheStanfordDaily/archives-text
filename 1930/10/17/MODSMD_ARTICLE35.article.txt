MIRTHFUL HAVEN—Booth Tark
infcton, Iloublcday, Doran. New
York. la.'JO.
1 Mirthful Haven was a small vil
lage in New England, priding itself
|on its heritage of Mayflower an
cestors, and its former prosperity
as a shipping town. Its people were
1 sharply divided. One group, the "na
tives," hated but condescended in
their poverty to the "summer peo
] pie," who in turn avoided social in
| tercourse with the descendants of
sound old stock.
In such an environment Ihe soul
of Edna Pelter is inevitably smoth
ered. "The last of the Pelters," she,
; and her father who has belied his
inheritance, drifting into a shiftless
existence except when engaged in
, bootlegging. But advantages enjoyed
by the type represented in the
"summer people" cannot break
down the fiercely stubborn pride
with which, refusing to desert her
| father and her "natives," Edna de
fends her sensitive self against the
cruelties of those who seek to in
' jure all "Pelters."
In her love for Gordon Corning,
a summer resident, she is pathetic
I in a comradely sense of the word.
Her acceptance of that which she
| feared would take Gordon from her,
' raises her to rank with other fine
characterizations drawn by Tarking
ton. It is too bad that the book
J itself, which opens in the charming
; and descriptive Tarkington style,
; drops into mediocrity, which can
not but draw its really interesting
character with it. —J. N.
CASANOVA'S HOMECOMING. By
Arthur Schnitzler. Simon and
Schuster, New York. 1 JKIO. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Penniless and,aged almost beyond
1 repair, Casanova, the irresistable
' lover and big man-about-town of
the nineteenth century, is returning
to his native Venice to become a

spy in the service of the government
when he meets a girl who makes
him feel young again.
But she prefers beauty to experi- ,
ence, and takes a handsome young |
officer who looks like the time-bat- ;
tered wife-stealer did forty years !
before.
Casanova gets her after a while, j
by fraud and the payment of 2000
ducats won gambling to the army j
boy, whom he later kills in a duel ■
over honor.
AH of which may or may not
prove that anyone nearing sixty
who wishes to practice successful
seduction must possess, besides j
Casanova's other qualities, both
wealth and craftiness.
Really, "Casanova's Homecoming," j
which was first issued in a limited j
edition in 1921, is a beautifully \
written and well-wrought work j
which deserves much more serious I
consideration than is given it here, j

THE TRAP—By Delfino Cinelli.
' John Day. (At the Stanford :

This passionate interlude is very ,
reminiscent of Sem Benelli's "The '
Jest." Set in modern Italy, but ;
steeped in primitive struggle and !
amour its intrigues have not the I
color anc| fascination of Benelli's j
, work.
The jealously guarded and neces- j
i sarily beautiful wife of a provincial |
wine-seller is spied by a noble (ap- !
1 parently there are dozens of them

a game-keeper who has received j
an injury at the hands of the mer
chant.
The tale progresses through eleven j
familiar chapters to a finale which j

tery, and madness.
It is suggested, as a weak shade
of The Jest, for casual reading.

CASANOVA'S HOMECOMING. By
Arthur Schnitzler. Simon and
Schuster, New York. 1 JKIO. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Penniless and,aged almost beyond
1 repair, Casanova, the irresistable
' lover and big man-about-town of
the nineteenth century, is returning
to his native Venice to become a

spy in the service of the government
when he meets a girl who makes
him feel young again.
But she prefers beauty to experi- ,
ence, and takes a handsome young |
officer who looks like the time-bat- ;
tered wife-stealer did forty years !
before.
Casanova gets her after a while, j
by fraud and the payment of 2000
ducats won gambling to the army j
boy, whom he later kills in a duel ■
over honor.
AH of which may or may not
prove that anyone nearing sixty
who wishes to practice successful
seduction must possess, besides j
Casanova's other qualities, both
wealth and craftiness.
Really, "Casanova's Homecoming," j
which was first issued in a limited j
edition in 1921, is a beautifully \
written and well-wrought work j
which deserves much more serious I
consideration than is given it here, j

prove that anyone nearing sixty
who wishes to practice successful
seduction must possess, besides j
Casanova's other qualities, both
wealth and craftiness.
Really, "Casanova's Homecoming," j

THE TRAP—By Delfino Cinelli.
' John Day. (At the Stanford :
Bookstore.)
This passionate interlude is very ,
reminiscent of Sem Benelli's "The '
Jest." Set in modern Italy, but ;
steeped in primitive struggle and !
amour its intrigues have not the I
color anc| fascination of Benelli's j
, work.
The jealously guarded and neces- j
i sarily beautiful wife of a provincial |
wine-seller is spied by a noble (ap- !
1 parently there are dozens of them
hanging constantly about for this J
very purpose) through the wiles of j
a game-keeper who has received j
an injury at the hands of the mer
chant.
The tale progresses through eleven j
familiar chapters to a finale which j
includes attempted murder, adul
tery, and madness.
It is suggested, as a weak shade
of The Jest, for casual reading.
