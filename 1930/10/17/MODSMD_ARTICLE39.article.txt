# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
Hell Week being well in progress !
at various fraternity houses, we !
must warn all newcomers to the
campus not to be alarmed at any- :
thing unusual they may see or
hear.
The high price of being a Row
man is being impressed on a
good many miserable sopho
mores. (Impression is used as a
synonym for a wooden paddle.
It sounds better).
It must be worth its price, or they
wouldn't go through with it; but
we definitely would rather not have
to.unravel shredded wheat biscuits
for a pastime, a 6 some of them are
having to do.
Two harrassed-looking sophs
came into a Palo Alto restaurant
about :i o'clock yesterday morn
ing, in search of some pigeon
eggs. We suggest the Museum
—or maybe a Chinese eating
house where they serve birds'-
nest soup.
After years of considering and |
serious consultation, the Sigma Chis
are actually having a new coat of!
paint put on their house. Notice
that we don't mention the color—
it's almost the worst on campus.
Maybe it's just a balance for the
ashes-of-roses sorority house on the
opposite side of the Row.
