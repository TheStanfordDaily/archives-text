THE POINT ACKNOWLEDGED
The Editor, Sir:
In the October 14 issue of The
Stanford Daily, on the sport page,
there was a story headed "Card |
Babes Will Meet Bruin Frosh In !
Southern Tilt." In the fourth para- •
graph of that story was the state- ,
ment that Keebles of the frosh had |
averaged 4 yards a buck while the i
frosh were downing Compton J.C. j
In the interests of Truth and Justice j
let it be known that the team the i
Frosh downed by one touchdown j
was Santa Monica J.C., which team j
Compton J.C. has kince defeated '
152-0. It is extremely doubtful in my
mind if the U.C.L.A. varsity could j
down Compton J.C., and certainly j
I know of no man on the varsity j
who could average "4 yards a buck" i
against them.
I hope you'll excuse this outburst j
but "we must do right by our Nell." j
Sincerely yours,
S. K. PETTERSON, J
