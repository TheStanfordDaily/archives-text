# NOTED AVIATRIX BREAKS RECORD
## Laura Ingalls' Record Is Cut Five Hours 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 16 (.4 3 ). â€”
Standing for only one week, the rec
ord of 30 hours, 27 minutes, for the
women's transcontinental east-west
flight, established by Miss Laura
Ingalls, was smashed today. Mrs.
Keith Miller, intreped British avia
trix, took nearly five hours from
Miss Ingall's time. Leaving Valley
Stream, N.Y., Monday morning, she
made the coast to coast transit in
25 hours, 44 minutes, by arriving at
Municipal Airport at 10:58 o'clock
this morning (P.S.T.)
Miss Ingalls is now flying east
ward in an attempt to set a west
east feminine record. Miss Miller,
who won fame flying with Captain
Lancaster from London to Australia
three years ago, will leave here "in
two or three days" to lower what
ever record her American rival sets.
The British woman who an
nounced at first she might hop off
Saturday for a none stop flight cast
ward, said slight repairs and changes
would necessitate remaining perhaps
longer.
Mrs. Miller made five stops on
the flight, making the last hop from
Winslow, Arizona.
