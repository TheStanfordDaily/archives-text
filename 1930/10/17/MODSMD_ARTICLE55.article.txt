# AERIAL ACROBATICS TO FEATURE LOCAL FIELD DEDICATION
## 
### 
Aided by fifteen army planes, a
series of aerial acrobatics including
formation flying, parachute jump
ing, and races are to feature the
dedication program of Campus
Field, local airport, Sunday, October
26, according to the Palo Alto
School of Aviation.
The program, which is being
sponsored by Post 375 of the Palo
Alto American Legion, will open at
9 o'clock, continuing throughout the
day until 5 o'clock. As the date se
lected is during the same week-end
as the U.S.C. game, a large number
of planes are expected on the field,
among these a Ford tri-motor. In
accordance with the general trend
of official air shows, all events will
be illustrative of the safety of air
planes, rather than stunt flying.
Legitimate thrills, however, will not
be eliminated.
