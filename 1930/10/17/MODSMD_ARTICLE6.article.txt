"Gads, girls, it's gone!"
"What's gone?"
"Chivalry—and ten minutes to
beat the lockout."'
Certainly, "Chivalry" was gone.
"Chivalry," it might be explained,
was the car which had transported
a group of feminine stages to a
Palo Alto theatre last night.
Ten-twenty, and chivalry was
never so much in need since the
dark ages.
Inspiration battered its way into
a fertile mind. Dividing into scout
ing parties, the frenzied females
tore up the sidewalks, and yea—
even the streets —in their frantic
search for Chivalry.
Much the worse for wear, Chiv
alry was found nestling at the curb
three blocks from the theatre. And
as the majestic door of Roble swung
shut, at 10:30 o'clock, six weary
co-eds who had just gained the
safety of the noble hall resolved
that emancipation is worthless if
chivalry is missing.
