# STANFORD ATHLETIC UNIT RATES AS ONE OF BEST IN COUNTRY, SURVEY REVEALS
## 
### 
With the completion of the sunken
baseball diamond, constituting the
I most recent addition to men's athle
tic facilities, a survey of the Uni
( versity's past building program re
! veals Stanford as possessing one of
i the nation's most adequate and
modern athletic units.
In 1915 Encina gymnasium was
built. Since that time two additional
wings have been added, the Encina
| basketball pavilion, erected in 1921,
and the new Board of Athletic Con
j trol office building, completed dur
i ing 1928-29.
These three buildings combined
with the swimming unit form a
part of a "Sports Quadrangle" which
| according to tentative building plans
; should be completed in 1937.
Of primary interest to football
fans is the Stanford stadium. Its
original seating capacity, when
erected in 1921, was 60,000 and the
cost was set at $234,000. In 1925 the
1 first addition was made consisting
of the partial closing of the open
; end. Expenditures amounted to
$168,000, and the seating capacity
was enlarged by 14,000.
The second addition, which was
made during 1928, provided for 14,-
j 400 more seats and the painting and
I repairing of the entire stadium at
I an approximate expense of $190,000.
One of the latest additions is the
1 swimming unit, constructed in 1929

> and equipped with a filtration sys- i
Item. There are three pools. One I
i is 40x75, with an even depth of she |
! feet, six inches, and is intended for
| meets and advanced swimming. A (
I second pool for the exclusive use I
| of divers and water polo, measures j
40x60 feet. The third is 33x60 feet i
j and has an even depth of 4 feet.
Another recent addition is the new j
| golf course. Consisting of 18 holes, 1
! it covers 185 acres, is 6,648 yards !
j long, and was put in at a cost of |
| approximately $155,000. Par is 71, ,
j and the course, besides being one !
! of the hardest on the Pacific Coast, '
ranks as one of the best. A $46,000 I
; clubhouse is being erected now and j
is scheduled to be completed by Oc- J
| tober 25.
A tentative building program j
planned by the Board of Athletic
, Control and adopted with the under- j
| standing that no expenditures shall !
.be considered as definite except '
; those already acted upon, provides
I for improvements upon the stadium ;
' to the amount of $125,000 during
j 1931-32; erection of handball courts, j
a playgx - ound, basketball courts, and j
further additions to the stadiumâ€”!
I to be made during 1933-34; squash
j courts, new tennis courts, the resur- 1
! facing of the old courts and addi
i tions to the boxing and wrestling i
i equipment will complete the pro- ;
1 gram in 1937.
