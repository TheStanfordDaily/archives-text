# TALKING PICTURE OF WASHINGTON'S LIFE TO BE PRODUCED
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (/Pj.â€”Ar
rangements were nearing comple
tion here today for the filming of
the picture which is to record the
life of George Washington from boy
hood to death.
Mount Vernon, the Washington
home overlooking the Potomac river,
is to be the setting for much of this
picture which is to be sent over the
country in connection with the cele
bration of tne two hundredth anni
versary of the birth of George
Washington in 1932.
The idea of making such a film in
both sound and color originated with
Representative Sol Bloom, of New
York, an associate director of the
George Washington Bicentennial
Commission. He was here today to
help mobilize the resources of the
motion picture industry, and of the
government, for the undertaking.
