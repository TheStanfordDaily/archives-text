# FIRST APPEARANCE OF BAND SATURDAY
## 
### 
One hundred and twelve members
of the Stanford Band bill make
their first appearance of the season
when Stanford meets Oregon State
on Saturday, according to Ernest
Whitney Martin, director of the or
ganization.
The band will not display a lot
of fancy formations as late com
mencement of practice has pre
vented sufficient drill. The fancy
maneuvers, Martin said, will have
to wait until the Washington game
when the band is expected to be a
well-drilled outfit.
Two tenor saxaphones are .still
needed in the band, Martin reports.
Experienced players interested are
asked to report at the bandhou.se on
Tuesday at 3:30 o'clock.
