# BEAR HAS CITIZENS UP ON THEIR TOES

### 
ANACONDA. Mont., Oct. IG. (/!')—
There is an air of uneasiness in
Aanaconda. The citizenry go about
their duties cautiously. Pedestrians
look before they round corners and
appear to be avoiding large trees.
11 is nothing at all—nothing but a
pel boar which escaped from its
owner late yesterday. True, it is a
pet, but nobody wants to meet the
animal.
