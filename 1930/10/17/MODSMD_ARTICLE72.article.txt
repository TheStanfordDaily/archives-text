Twenty lettermen, a veteran line,
an irate coach, and a team pointing
for the Cardinals, spell toil and
trouble for the Warnermen within
the Stanford Stadium tomorrow. Ail
of these are part and parcel of the
Oregon State outfit which will in
vade the Farm today.

A year ago, Schissler brought a
(cam of Beavers to the campus, and
when (he shades of night drew their
curtain over the scene of combat,
(lie scoreboard read Stanford 10.
Oregon State 7. That score was no
indication of the actual merits of
lh» Heavers, and the Orangemen still
bear the scars of that rout. Schissler
will throw everything he has with
the exception of the water bucket
at (he Redshirts tomorrow, for re
venge is what the Orange and Black
mentor craves.

After four "practice" games, the
Conference curtain rises for the
Cardinals Saturday. And once be
gun, the Warm rmen meet Southern
California, the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles, and Washing
ton on successive week-ends. Cali
fornia will round out the Confer
ence group of five clashes.
:o:
That Stanford must win ;ill of her
Conference games is self-evident
after a peck at the schedules of
Washington State and Oregon, for
these two teams from the great
Northwest stand excellent chances
of taking all of their league tilts. In
fact, at the present stage of the race,
the Cougars and the Webfeet are
better bets than the Stanford Card
inals.
The followers of the Big Red Ma
chine will do well to cock an atten
tive ear towards the loud speaker
system tomorrow when any mention
of the Washington-Oregon clash is
wafted out into the atmosphere.
None other than Glenn Scobey War
ner has gone on record as favoring
lhe Oregonians over Phelan and his
men, but for Stanford's sake it
would lie much better if "Bow Down
to Washington" ring true.
In fact, if the Huskies can play
pant-killers and knock off Oregon
and Washington State, it would
make things appear a little better
for the local boys. I'helan is the
main obstacle in the way of both
Spears' and HoHingbery's hopes for
a championship eleven, and if he
docs not win another Conference
i'june except these two. he will have
made the league safer for the South
ern members.
:o:
Ore on State has already been de
feated by the Trojans, 27-7, and the
score ut. the Card-Beaver game will
be used to secure a line on the re
spective merits ot the teams which
will me ! here next week. However,
the Oregon State bunch which faced
Southern California and the group
which will meet Stanford will be
two horses of varying hues, and any
guesses based on comparative scores
must take into consideration the
mental attitudes of the teams before
combat.
:o:- t
In fact, while your bumble col
umnist has been fairly lucky to date,
he hesitates to place himself on the
spot by score predictions. If he
could accurately estimate results of
encounters, he would be able to
pick up a flock of greenbacks in
various guessing games. And so,
with the admission that one guess is
as good as the next, we pick Stan
ford to win tomorrow by one touch
down, possibly by two. Oregon
State scored on V.S.C.. and it would
not be impossible for them to score
on Stanford.

That Stanford must win ;ill of her

Washington State and Oregon, for

the Cougars and the Webfeet are
better bets than the Stanford Card

pant-killers and knock off Oregon
