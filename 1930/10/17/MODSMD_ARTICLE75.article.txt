# Frosh Gridmen Invade Bruin's Lair Tomorrow
## CARD BABES FACE UNDEFEATED UCLA YEARLING ELEVEN Bradshaw Expecting Plenty Of Opposition From Spirited Team 
### Stewart Crawford 
Set for what is expected to be a
tough battle, Coach Jimmy Brad
shaw and his twenty-five yearling
grid warriors are encamped in the
Southland awaiting the opening gun
which will launch them into their
first "conference" struggle with the
Bruin babes tomorrow.
Though the freshman mentor is
optimistic regarding the chances for
a Card victory, he is not overlook
ing the fact that he is meeting a
Bruin in his own lair, and an in
spired Bruin at that.
Best Team Yet
Coach Oster's frosh Uclans started
the season rated as the best year
ling eleven ever mustered at that
institution, trampling both the Glen
dale J.C. outfit and the Pasadena
J.C. gridders in their first two
starts.
Though in the latter of these two
contests Oster's men did not show
too much class, last week they rose
to unexpected heights to down a
powerful Oneonta Military Academy
team.
The yearling schedule of the
southern institution is followed by
the student body with interest al
most equal to that shown for the
varsity football, since it is to the
freshman squad that this compara
tively new entrant in the coast con
ference has to look for future var
sity material.

This year's Uclan babes indicate
that they have that needed material
in Keeble, Robb, Giss, and Morgi
son, a quartet of back field men who
have kicked, passed, and bucked
their way through an undefeated
season so far.
Bradshaw's Redshirts, also unde
feated, will enter the contest hop
ing to outshine the Uclan backfield
With Maentz. Hillman, White, and
Anderson. Anderson will do the
booting for the Cards, while the
other three demonstrated in the
Santa Clara game their ability to
pack the pigskin. The passing of
Maentz is one of Bradshaw's most
effective weapons.
Card Line Strong
With a line which was a stone
wall to the battering of the Santa
Clara yearlings two weeks ago, the
freshman mentor has an outfit which
should down the Bruins tomorrow.
But an inspired team battling on its
home field may prove an unexpect
edly tough obstacle for the Card
yearlings to overcome.
The probable lineup for the tilt
is as follows:
Stanford Frosh U.C.L.A. Frosh
Edelen LER Kasl
Palamountain LTII Rafferty
Tarver LGR Hendry
Kant/nor C Baldwin
Alden RGL Austin
Tatum RTL Wood
Monsalve REL Lane

Set for what is expected to be a
tough battle, Coach Jimmy Brad
shaw and his twenty-five yearling
grid warriors are encamped in the
Southland awaiting the opening gun
which will launch them into their
first "conference" struggle with the
Bruin babes tomorrow.
Though the freshman mentor is
optimistic regarding the chances for
a Card victory, he is not overlook
ing the fact that he is meeting a
Bruin in his own lair, and an in
spired Bruin at that.
Best Team Yet
Coach Oster's frosh Uclans started
the season rated as the best year
ling eleven ever mustered at that
institution, trampling both the Glen
dale J.C. outfit and the Pasadena
J.C. gridders in their first two
starts.
Though in the latter of these two
contests Oster's men did not show
too much class, last week they rose
to unexpected heights to down a
powerful Oneonta Military Academy
team.
The yearling schedule of the
southern institution is followed by
the student body with interest al
most equal to that shown for the
varsity football, since it is to the
freshman squad that this compara
tively new entrant in the coast con
ference has to look for future var
sity material.

This year's Uclan babes indicate
that they have that needed material
in Keeble, Robb, Giss, and Morgi
son, a quartet of back field men who
have kicked, passed, and bucked
their way through an undefeated
season so far.
Bradshaw's Redshirts, also unde
feated, will enter the contest hop
ing to outshine the Uclan backfield
With Maentz. Hillman, White, and
Anderson. Anderson will do the
booting for the Cards, while the
other three demonstrated in the
Santa Clara game their ability to
pack the pigskin. The passing of
Maentz is one of Bradshaw's most
effective weapons.
Card Line Strong
With a line which was a stone
wall to the battering of the Santa
Clara yearlings two weeks ago, the
freshman mentor has an outfit which
should down the Bruins tomorrow.
But an inspired team battling on its
home field may prove an unexpect
edly tough obstacle for the Card
yearlings to overcome.
The probable lineup for the tilt
is as follows:
Stanford Frosh U.C.L.A. Frosh
Edelen LER Kasl
Palamountain LTII Rafferty
Tarver LGR Hendry
Kant/nor C Baldwin
Alden RGL Austin
Tatum RTL Wood
Monsalve REL Lane
