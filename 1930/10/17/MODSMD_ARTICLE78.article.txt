# WEEKLY TRACK MEET TO BE HELD AGAIN AT 4 O'CLOCK TODAY
## 
### 
With the rule of shortened dis
tances again in vogue, the second
of the weekly fall track and field
meets will be held at 4:20 o'clock at
the practice oval this afternoon.
Although the runners are begin
ning to round into shape, all races
above the dashes will be shortened,
as last week, so as not to prove too
great a strain so early in the season.
The century is expected to be one
of the features of this afternoon's
meet, with Les Hables, winner last j
week, facing Lombardi, Howell, |
Giberson, Wilson, and possibly .
Dyer. t
Greater smoothness has been ap- )
parent this week on the part of i
competitors in the field events, and '
an interesting early season meet is |
expected.
