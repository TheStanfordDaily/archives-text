# FENCING SQUAD CUT ANNOUNCED BY COACH BUGGE
## Snyder Holds Captaincy For Second Time; Expect Successful Year 
### 
In announcing the cutting of the
varsity fencing squad to eight men,
Coach E. Bugge last night declared
prospects for the approaching season
to be bright.
Last year the Cardinal foil wield
ers defeated California in the an
nual meet and took second in the
minor sports carnival at Los An
geles, in Which Stanford, California,
Southern California, and U.C.L.A.
competed. Bugge expects this sea
son to be at least as successful, if
not more so.
The octette retained on the squad
includes Captain Jack Snyder, Asa
Douglas, John Ferguson, Lawrence
Higgens, Fred Pearman, Tom Pock
man, Leonard Pockman, and James
Reed.
Snyder Captain
Snyder, captain for the second
successive year, is commencing his
third year of competition. He usu
ally fences with his left hand, but
can also handle the foil well with
his right hand. Left-handers, ac
cording to Bugge, have about the
same advantage over opponents as
do southpaw boxers.
Douglas, another port-sider, was
with the varsity last year, and is a
clever foilsman. Ferguson is a fresh
man registered from Los Angeles,
where he fenced for the Los An
geles Athletic Club.
Higgens and Pearman, another
southpaw, both placed in the San
Francisco Bay Division novice
championships last ypar.
Pockman Transfer
Tom Pockman is a transfer from
a southern California junior college.
He is showing much promise, ac
cording to Bugge. His brother,
Leonard, was a frosh last year, win
ning all his matches in the Cali
fornia meet. He is not only a good
foilsman, but is equally good with
the epee and sabre.
Reed was a member of the var
sity squad last year and should
prove a valuable member of this
year's crew.
