a battle when the two teams mei
here tomorrow at 4 o'clock.
The Rovers are a bunch of youn
players with lots of fire and aggros
siveness which carried them throug
to the state title last year, despit
the fact that it was their first yea
of competition with top-rank in
teams.
Coach Maloney is undismayec
however, by the opposition whir
his men will meet tomorrow.
"I am not afraid of a large scor
being run up on us," lie declarei
' "1 have no worries about my de
tense. The only question in my min
is whether my offense will stai
clicking. Whether we win or lose
will be good clean, stiff competition.
In the effort to strengthen th
Card attack, Maloney has rearrange
his forward line, and hopes that I;
has found the combination whic
Will work together properly. Th
following is the tentative openin
combination for tomorrow's cont.es
Ritfht wing, Falk; left wing, Mujic;
right half, Jackson; center hal
Christensen; left half, Reynolds; lo!
fullback, Burns; rfght fullback, Dal
ton; and goal guard, Webster.
Miller's usual position is centc
forward, with Nichols at insid
light, while Eberhart common!
plays left wing and Mujica insid
left. Eberhart has been handicappc
by a bad "Charley horse" whic
slows him down, and this disabilit
will be of less consequence ;il in
side left than on the wing.
| The varsity eleven has been un
[ expectedly weakened by the in
(eligibility of Washburn, flashy cen
J ter forward, who was counted upoi
; to supply much of the offensiv
punch.
