# TOMBSTONE RISES FROM HER GRAVE IN HUGE PAGEANT
## Days Of Six-Gun, Bloody Fights Recalled In "Helldorado" 
### 
TOMBSTONE, Ariz., Oct. 16 (/I 5 ).
-Tombstone is not dead.
In pageantry its citizens, and those
whom some in these enlightened
days might call its denizens, have
cast off the dusty chrysalis of years
today to walk again the streets
which once echoed their more real
istic and sturdier tread.
It is the first revival of Tomb
stone's "Helldorado," recasting the
Halcyon days when the crumbling
little city was the silver capital of
the southwest, when red blood and
red licjuor went hand in hand, and
the six gun was man's law—and
woman's tog.
For three days a flesh and blood
ghost of Ed Schielfelin will wield
again the pick which, biting into a
rich silver vein, produced a hard
bitten, swashbuckling community of
sudden riches, gained and lost, not
equalled before or since.
Old Characters Live
Schieffelin has passed on, and the
heydey of Tombstone with him.
But the Bird Cage Theatre still
is here, and the Palace Bar, once
gleaming with mirrors, and the long
main street, down which despera
does still may gallop and along
which guns may crackle. The street
is the same which looked upon the
daredeviltries of Wild Bill Hickok,
and so are some, indeed, of the faces,
although they must peer down the
vista of fifty years or more.
Curley Bill Brocius and Ike Clan
ton will embarrass the worthy pas
tor of St. Paul's church, as of yore;
Curley Bill will shoot Town Mar
shall White, and Johnny Behind
the-Duce will beat the lyncher's
rope. John Ringo will fight his
handkerchief duel, and the Earl's
and the Clantons will unsheath their
forty-fives in the battle which fore
cast the coming of law ar.d order.
Coroner's inquests—history records
them as numerous if perfunctory—
and court scenes will be reproduced
in the virile language of the day.
The "Helldorado,' celebrated for
the first time last year, has been
made an annual event, that Tomb
stone may not indeed pass on, and
the events of a colorful era may not
grow too dim.

cast off the dusty chrysalis of years
today to walk again the streets
which once echoed their more real
istic and sturdier tread.
It is the first revival of Tomb
stone's "Helldorado," recasting the
Halcyon days when the crumbling
little city was the silver capital of
the southwest, when red blood and
red licjuor went hand in hand, and
the six gun was man's law—and
woman's tog.
For three days a flesh and blood
ghost of Ed Schielfelin will wield
again the pick which, biting into a
rich silver vein, produced a hard
bitten, swashbuckling community of
sudden riches, gained and lost, not
equalled before or since.

Schieffelin has passed on, and the
heydey of Tombstone with him.
But the Bird Cage Theatre still
is here, and the Palace Bar, once
gleaming with mirrors, and the long
main street, down which despera
does still may gallop and along
which guns may crackle. The street
is the same which looked upon the
daredeviltries of Wild Bill Hickok,
and so are some, indeed, of the faces,
although they must peer down the
vista of fifty years or more.
Curley Bill Brocius and Ike Clan
ton will embarrass the worthy pas
tor of St. Paul's church, as of yore;
Curley Bill will shoot Town Mar
shall White, and Johnny Behind
the-Duce will beat the lyncher's
rope. John Ringo will fight his
handkerchief duel, and the Earl's
and the Clantons will unsheath their
forty-fives in the battle which fore
cast the coming of law ar.d order.
Coroner's inquests—history records
them as numerous if perfunctory—
and court scenes will be reproduced
in the virile language of the day.
The "Helldorado,' celebrated for
the first time last year, has been
made an annual event, that Tomb
stone may not indeed pass on, and
the events of a colorful era may not
grow too dim.
TOMBSTONE, Ariz., Oct. 16 (/I 5 ).
-Tombstone is not dead.
In pageantry its citizens, and those
whom some in these enlightened
days might call its denizens, have
cast off the dusty chrysalis of years
today to walk again the streets
which once echoed their more real
istic and sturdier tread.
