NASHVILLE. Tenn., Oct. 16 (/Pi.
â€”Senator Gerald P. Nye, chairman
of the senate campaign funds in
vestigating committee, today said he
did not believe the mysterious
wounding last night of James N.
Cox, a witness before the committee,
had anything to do with the hearing
the committee is conducting into the
democratic senatorial primary in
Tennessee.
"It would be hard for me to be
lieve that the wounding of Cox had
any relation to our inquiry," the
committee chairman said. The hear
ing, he added, would be resumed at
1 o'clock today as scheduled.
Cox was taken to a hospital from
his room in a hotel last night, with
gashes on his throat and face.
The Nashville Banner quoted Cox
today as saying he was wounded in
in argument over the approaching
Vanderbilt-Tennessee football game.
