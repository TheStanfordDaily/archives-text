# ENGLAND WATCHING RIVALRY OF PILOTS
## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 1(5 (/!').â€”England
focused its attention today upon the
] progress of Wing Commander
j Charles Kingsford-Smith and the
young British air force lieutenant,
C. W. Hill, between whom a keen
ii unintended rivalry has developed
in their record-making flights from
London to Australia.
Although Hill left Croybon four
days ahead of Kingsford-Smith, the
latter today had gained so much
that he probably was not more than
1,000 miles behind his rival when
he flew into Singapore. Hill had
reached Batavia, Java.
j At the outset the airmen were
racing against time. Undoubtedly
i they are running a hot race against
each other's time, and putting theii
! machines to the utmost tests at the
same time to beat the record of Bert
Hinkler, who flew the same course
in 15 1-2 days a few years ago.
