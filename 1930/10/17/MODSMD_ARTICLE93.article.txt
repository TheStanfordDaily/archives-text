WASHINGTON. Oct. 1G
Narcotic smuggling conditions in the

the United States Government as
serious in a report to be transmitted

It was learned today that the nar
cotic bureau of the treasury is pre
paring the report which will say
that during the calendar year 1929,
the authorities seized 1,023 kilo
grammes, or more than one ton of
prepared opium in the islands. The
seizures, narcotic officials said, re
presented only a small portion of
the quantity attempted to be smug

manufactured. The figures, they
said, indicate a necessity of devoting
particular attention to narcotic en

special investigation of the present
situation in regard to the unlawful
