## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16. (/I 5 )— A
shadowy figure against his bedroom
window caused Secretary of State
Stimson last night to call for police
aid, but no prowler was found.
Three automobile loads of police
men rushed to "Woodley," the Sec
retary's handsome suburban home,
and conducted a thorough search of
the grounds. Finding no trace of
an intruder they departed, leaving
no guard.
The Secretary believed someone
was trying to enter his room.
