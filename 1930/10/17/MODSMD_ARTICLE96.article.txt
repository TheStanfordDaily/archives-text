# EWING RECOMMENDS FOUNDATION GRANTS FOR WAR ON CANCER
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 16 i/P).â€”
The creation of live or six great in
stitutions at strategic points
throughout the country to be de
voted to the fight against cancer
was recommended today by Dr.
James Ewing, of the New York Skin
and Cancer hospital, at a round
table conference at the clinical con
gress of the American College of I
Surgeons.
Dr. Ewing said the institutions
would cost about $10,000,000 each
and that one or two of them should
be government owned and the
others privately owned. He ex
pressed the opinion that until such
steps are taken it would be almost
impossible to control cancer because
the study of the disease was such a
tremendous undertaking as to de
mand group study.
"Cancer cannot be controlled by
individuals." lie said. "Diagnosis de
mands expensive experiment, gained
only through experiment.
"The proposed institutions should
have three functions. First, service
to the patient, diagnosis and treat
ment; second, they should be centers
for dissemination of cancer knowl- '
edge to the public and the training
of cancer specialists; and third, re
search, the most important and most
expensive function."
