Do the tastes of college students
tend toward frivolous or serious
subjects? From their choices of
magazines over at the Bookstore, it
would seem that they ax - e not only
serious, but cultural and, strangely
enough, lacking in political interest.
The greatest demand is for maga
zines on subjects such as art. litera
ture, reviews, and particularly
those of contemporaneous writing.
"Bookman," "Studio," French
monthlies, and others of this tone,
are sold out almost as soon as they
come in.
The "Post" and the "New Yorker"
are the favorites, when it comes to
light reading. It is interesting that
although students frequently glance
through the monthly publications
of other universities, such as the
"Pelican," they seldom, if ever, buy
them.
As for political magazines, such
as the "Outlook" and the "New Re
public," there is no call whatsoever
for them. Even "Time" fails to
"take" on the campus.
The Bookstore always tries to fill
the needs and demands of the stu
dents, so that if one is to draw
one's conclusions from this source,
it certainly looks as though the in
habitants of the Farm were becom
ing very civilized—let us say even
highbrow in the matter of their
literature.
