HANKOW, China, Oct. 16. (/P) â€”
Bert N. Nelson, American Lutheran
missionary, kidnapped by commun
ist outlaws October 5 from Kwang
shan, southeastern Homan province,
today was reported unharmed a few
days ago and suffering no hardships.
He was held for ransom payment of
$300,000 Mexican (about $90,000
gold.)
The missionary's associates, writ
ing from Sinyang, presumably after
communicating with Nelson, said
his treatment was not harsh, but he
was held a close prisoner.
The home of Nelson is at Minne
apolis. His father, Daniel Nelson, a
pioneer Lutheran missionary in
China, was killed by a stray bullet
at Sinyang in 1926 when military
factions besieged Sinyang.
