full silk-lined Braeburn Tux
very specially priced
$ 46 50
A $55 Value
Fancy a full silk-!ined Braeburn tuxedo at this special
price ... By present standards of value this tux is worth
$55. The Braeburn tux has set an exacting standard for
young men's evening wear . . . just enough swank to be a
trifle bold . . . just enough drape to be entirely genteel.
It takes a highly specialized organization like Braeburn
to produce a tux like this at $46.50.
