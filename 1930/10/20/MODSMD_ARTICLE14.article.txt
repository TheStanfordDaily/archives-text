BUDD LAKE, N.J., Oct. 19. (/I J > â€”
Farmers in this vicinity are nod
ding their heads toward the Hack
ettstown mountains and saying,
"There's gold in them thar hills."
How much gold is another ques
tion. In recent years several small
deposits have been found. But now
Archie Ludlow Saunders, who has
bean tilling the soil for the best part
of his 73 years, has come upon a
vein which, according to an assay of
samples he sent to Denver, should
yield $5 to the ton in gold and sil
ver.
It all came about through Saun
ders' skill with the divining rod.
During his residence here he has
discovered more than forty-five
subterranean springs and streams
with his staff. One day, more than
a year ago, his wife brought him a
$20 gold piece. Saunders experi
mented and found that the coin
tugged at his rod even as water.
