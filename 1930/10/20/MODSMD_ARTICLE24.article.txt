# ALMOST HALF OF 1930 PHI BETES PROMINENT IN CAMPUS ACTIVITIES

What kind of students make Phi
Beta Kappa? Arc they "grinds"?
Or aren't they after all very much
like the rest of us, only a little more
capable? Here arc a few facts
about the outside activities of the
fifty-live students who were initi
ated into "Phi Bete last June.
There is a larger percentage of
fraternity men and women in Phi
Beta Kappa than in the University
in general. Out of the fifty-five in
the list, twenty-one were "row" stu
dents, and only one-third of the
entire University arc members of
social fraternities.
Approximately two-thirds (thirty
two out of the fifty-five) of the
June initiates were registered in the
Appointment Office as either entire
ly or partilly self-supporting, while
in school. This is almost exactly the

same proportion as are employed
from the whole student body.
Twenty-five of them were active
in student activities, outside of other
I honorary fraternities to which they
1 belonged, or departmental work.
The list contains the names of one
class president, one man and one
woman sponsor, women's editor and
business manager of the Daily, three
members each of the Daily and
Quad staffs, two members of the
Rally committee, one member of
Cap and Gown, three members of
women's conference, two members
of the track team, captain of the
fencing team, president of the Circle
"S" society, one member each of the
women's "S" society, the tennis
team, class hockey team, a member
of the debate team, of the glee club,
a participant in several plays, and n
' Y.VV.C.A. officer.
