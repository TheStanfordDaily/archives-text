# MUSICIANS NEED SELF-ASSURANCE
## Marine Band Soloists Give Views On Playing 
### 
If you underestimate your own
ability don't take up the study of
music, warns Winfred Kemp, solo
cornetist with the United States
Marine Band, who will give "Hun
garian Melodies" this afternoon at
the matinee concert in the Pavilion
at 3 o'clock.
People are immediately conscious
of any effort you put into your
playing, and that at once kills the
effect, he believes. This does not
mean that a musician must be an
egotist, but he certainly must not
underestimate his own power or
the audience will quickly assume
the sarle attitude.
Self-Assurancc Needed
The other afternoon soloist, Wil
bur Kieffer, also believes that a
musician must have self-assurance.
Kieffer, who is to give a xylophone
solo, has charge of the drumming
section of the band.
According to the drummer, al
most every man, woman, and child
in the audience believes he has a
fair knowledge of drumming. That
is, the average person figures he
knows enough about the art to voice
a pretty good criticism.
"Like Baseball"
"It's like baseball or politics,"
Kieffer remarks. "You never met
anybody who couldn't tell you how
to play a game of baseball or offer
suggestions as to how the country
should be run. They might profess
utter ignorance of art, music, or
law, but drumming seems to be well
within their ken."
Robert. E. Clark, trombone player,
and Arthur S. Witcomb, cornetist,
are the soloists of the evening pro
gram tonight.
