FRESNO, Oct. 19. </Piâ€”Racketeer
ing in the eastern grape markets,
with the resultant loss of thousands
of dollars annually to the grape in
dustry through the payment of
tribute to gangsters, is being in
vestigated by the California Grape
Control Board with the view of
seeking government intervention to
eliminate the practice.
This was the announcement of
Frederick J. Koster, San Francisco,
president of the Grape Control
Board, in a talk before the San
Joaquin Valley unit of the California
Newspaper Publishers' Association
here last night.
"We are now investigating the
racketeering tribute that is being
exacted in Chicago, New York, and
Jersey City from grape men," said
Koster. "The Federal Farm Board,
under the agricultural marketing
act, has power to act in such cases
and we intend to enlist the aid of
that body and the department of
justice in stopping the practice."
