# VARSITY JUKES BEAVERS, 13-7, IN HARD GAME
## Warner's Men Show Lack Of Fire In Discouraging Second Half O.S.C. FEATURES PASSES 
### Len Kallmann 
Disappointing followers of the Bin
Red Machine by their inability to
score in the second half, Stanford
squeezed through with a 13-7 win
over Oregon State Saturday in the
Cardinal stadium.
The complete lack of (ire dis
played by the Warnermen during
the final periods of play was as
discouraging to the supporters of
the team as it was encouraging to
Howard Jones.
Two touchdowns behind, Oregon
State threw passes all over the field
in the third period. A forty-yard
toss put the Beavers on the Card
20-yard stripe, and three plays later
Buerke passed to Little who went
10 yards down the sidelines to dive
over Hillman and reach the end
zone.
Second Team Used
Opening with a second team, the
Cardinals had pushed Oregon State
all over the field in the first quarter
and the first two-thirds of the sec
ond, only to lose the ball on downs
when the Beaver defense tightened
near the goal line.
When Warner put an inspii'ed first
string into the game with but five
minutes of play remaining in the
second quarter, two touchdowns fol
lowed before the gun ended the
half. Moffatt took the ball over for
both scores, the first one resulting
from a reverse and lateral from
Bogue to Moffatt after which Mof
fatt moved over for a score from
13 yards out.
Moffatt Scores Again
Stanford's second tally came after
Caglieri had accepted Buerke's pass
on the Orangemen's 23-yard line.
After a penalty of 15 yards for hold
ing and a 5-yard fine for two incom
plete passes, Rothert connected with
Moffatt on a long toss and the Cards
had their score for the game posted
on the books.
Sixteen first downs the Redshirts
amassed to their credit; Oregon gar
nered six. But the yardage made in
midfield did not make touchdowns,
and three times the Redshirts failed
miserably within their opponents'
20-yard marker.
The varied Stanford offense lost
variety in scoring territory, and the
old adage about a straight line was
the limit of Cardinal strategy.
No Serious Injuries
The Redshirts were fortunate Sat
urday in the matter of injuries, no
serious casualties being reported
after the game. While Hillman sus
tained a broken nose and Hand a
bad cut over one eye, neither will
lose any time from practice this
week.
The return of Caglieri and Bar
din to the active list leaves Captain
Ray Tandy and Henri Laborde alone
inactive.
Tandy's absence is the only cause
for concern, since Laborde will
probably not be used in any games
this year, and there is a bare pos
sibility that the Stanford leader will
be in the starting lineup Saturday.

from a reverse and lateral from
Bogue to Moffatt after which Mof
fatt moved over for a score from
13 yards out.
Moffatt Scores Again
Stanford's second tally came after
Caglieri had accepted Buerke's pass
on the Orangemen's 23-yard line.
After a penalty of 15 yards for hold
ing and a 5-yard fine for two incom
plete passes, Rothert connected with
Moffatt on a long toss and the Cards
had their score for the game posted
on the books.
Sixteen first downs the Redshirts
amassed to their credit; Oregon gar
nered six. But the yardage made in
midfield did not make touchdowns,
and three times the Redshirts failed
miserably within their opponents'
20-yard marker.
The varied Stanford offense lost
variety in scoring territory, and the
old adage about a straight line was
the limit of Cardinal strategy.
No Serious Injuries
The Redshirts were fortunate Sat
urday in the matter of injuries, no
serious casualties being reported
after the game. While Hillman sus
tained a broken nose and Hand a
bad cut over one eye, neither will
lose any time from practice this
week.
The return of Caglieri and Bar
din to the active list leaves Captain
Ray Tandy and Henri Laborde alone
inactive.
Tandy's absence is the only cause
for concern, since Laborde will
probably not be used in any games
this year, and there is a bare pos
sibility that the Stanford leader will
be in the starting lineup Saturday.
Disappointing followers of the Bin
Red Machine by their inability to
score in the second half, Stanford
squeezed through with a 13-7 win
over Oregon State Saturday in the
Cardinal stadium.
The complete lack of (ire dis
played by the Warnermen during
the final periods of play was as
discouraging to the supporters of
the team as it was encouraging to
Howard Jones.
Two touchdowns behind, Oregon
State threw passes all over the field
in the third period. A forty-yard
toss put the Beavers on the Card
20-yard stripe, and three plays later
Buerke passed to Little who went
10 yards down the sidelines to dive
over Hillman and reach the end
zone.
Second Team Used
Opening with a second team, the
Cardinals had pushed Oregon State
all over the field in the first quarter
and the first two-thirds of the sec
ond, only to lose the ball on downs
when the Beaver defense tightened
near the goal line.
When Warner put an inspii'ed first
string into the game with but five
minutes of play remaining in the
second quarter, two touchdowns fol
lowed before the gun ended the
half. Moffatt took the ball over for
both scores, the first one resulting
from a reverse and lateral from
Bogue to Moffatt after which Mof
fatt moved over for a score from
13 yards out.
