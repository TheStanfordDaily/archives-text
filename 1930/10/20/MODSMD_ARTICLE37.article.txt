# THE 						GOOD WILL ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
I Diversity of Southern California's farcical "five-year-old tra
ction" has settled the good will assembly question for one year and
the Trojans' peace of mind is tranquil.
X'ext Friday the student body president of the southern insti
tiition will attempt to bring that well-known Southern California
good will to Stanford. The outcome is doubtful.
In the meantime, Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president, who through
courtesy's sake consented to speak to the Trojan students last Fri
day in spite of his expressed sentiments against good will rallies, is
tn br commended for his good-natured appearance in I .os Angeles.
