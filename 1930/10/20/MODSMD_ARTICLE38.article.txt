# A 						MUSICAL TREAT
## 
### 
Today the Cnited States Marine Band opens the concert series
to be held under the auspices of the Associated Students. Stanford
i-. to be congratulated 011 having the interest and initiative to carry
through a plan which will bring some of the best of contemporary
musicians to the campus.
No better argument could be advanced against the theory held
by many that university students occupy themselves with athletics,
activities, and jazz to the exclusion of all that is generally supposed
to be culture. The fact that the house is already more than half
said out to holders of season tickets is evidence enough to disprove
such a contention.
I wen with 50 per cent of the tickets already subscribed for,
Manager Carl McDowell states that the sale is not up to normal.
Stanford students of two college generations back fought hard to
bring this worthwhile institution to the campus; and the series
proved a decided success, both culturally and financially.
The concert scric- is not a charity, it stands squarely on its own
merits as a good investment with full value returned for the small
admission fee charged.
Most of the old students are supporting the series; but many
freshmen and junior transfers, unfamiliar with the fine programs
offered, have failed to respond.
Attend the opening concert today and give yourself a musical
treat.
