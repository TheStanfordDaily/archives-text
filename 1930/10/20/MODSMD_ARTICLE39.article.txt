To have its name borne to the ends of the earth as the official
cognomen of the new cruiser now under construction for the I'nited
States Navy, is the present aim and aspiration of the City of Palo
Alto. Request that the new cruiser he christened the ''Palo Alto"
was made in a recent communication to Secretary Adams of the
Wavy Department by the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce.
Palo Alto feels that it is deserving of such recognition chiefly
because it is the home of certain well-known Americans. Those
named in the chamber of commerce letter were President Hoover;
Seretarv Wilbur: Comptroller Roth, president of Rotary Inter
national: and W. 15. Allen, president of the National Hardware
IJealers.
The City of Palo Alto, apparently, believes in the principle of
reflected glory.
