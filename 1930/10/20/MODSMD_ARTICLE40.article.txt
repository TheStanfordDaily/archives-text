At last conies a gleam of light in the prevailing economic gloom
which our business experts of the Dean luge school assure is to
throw the sun of good old Coolidge prosperity into a semi-perma
nent eclipse.
Spokesmen of one of America's greatest industries, the manu
facture of cosmetics, have just broken forth in trade journals with
the cheering news that the sales of their products showed a sizeable
increase during the past year.
And with the same gesture they reach across a hypothetical con
ference table, and give the hand of fellowship to the czars of style.
I'"or they ascribe the cause of their increased affluence to a belief
that 1930 styles in women's dresses have swelled the sales of lip
stick, cold-cream, eye-lash tonic, mud packs, and cheek kalsomine.
The gist of the thing is that since skirt hem-lines have been sold
short by the bears and dropped a good six: points beneath knee-par.
men pay more attention to feminine facial topography, with the
result that the dear ladies are plastering more and more goo and
gumbo on the area which bears the strain of this withering scrutiny.
11 looks like a good thing for everyone concerned. Textile man
ufacturers are happilv engaged in turning out 20 per cent more
fabric to make the same number of frocks: cosmetic companies will
declare extra dividends once a month: the raising of the average
man's optical objective to higher fields is of undoubted aesthetic
value: and the plastic surgeons will undoubtedly make up for the
loss of operations on how-legs by inventing some ingenious method
of transferring dimples intact from knees to checks.—Oregon F.w
