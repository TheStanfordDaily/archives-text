THE SANTA FE TRAIL—At the
New Stanford Theatre,
Richard Arlen and Rosila Moreno,
assisted by Eugene Pallette and two
amusing juveniles, stage an old-time
tale of sheep grazing land troubles,
villains interested in acquiring' the
property of a descendant of Spanish
nobility, Indians, and at odd mo
ments, love, all in the general loca
tion of the Santa Fe Trail.
Only one innocent person is mur
dered, and the villain's death nulli
fies that. The lack of the usual
hand-to-hand fighting between the
villain and the hero is hardly no
ticeable, because the hectic riding
of "Old-Timer," aged eleven, and
Emily, still younger, leaves you in
a dazzling state of dubiousness.
It all ends happily, and, by the
way, you won't mind missing '"Mrs.
Gibbs" if you arrive just in time
for the main picture. —J. N.
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA — A( the Curran
Theatre.
Opening the popular concert series
of the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, Basil Cameron, the new
conductor, gave an enthusiastic
audience a fine sample of his ability
as musician and interpreter. His
rendition of the program was spir
ited and colorful with intelligent
phrasing and brilliant contrasts.
Handling of the strings was espe
cially fine.
Beethoven's "Fidelio" overture
gave Cameron an opportunity to
show his ability as an interpreter
of tense, dramatic music, while in

Mozart's serenade, "Ein Kleine
Nachtmusik," the gay, lyric side was
brought uot. Two Saint Saens num
bers proved rather an anticlimax,
but Percy Grainger's "Jutish Med- ,
ley" was interesting as a novol and i
original arrangement of Danish folk
songs. The program was closed in
the grand style by Liszt's "Hun
garian Rhapsody" number one.

ON FORSYTE 'CHANGE. By John
Galsworthy. Scri bner's, New
York. 19.10. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
A collection of short stories form- I
ing a sort of Apocrypha to "Foryste
Saga." It is enjoyable reading for j
those already familiar wrth that j
large and fascinating clan, the For- i
sytes, but it is far too cluttered j
with references and cross references |
to be anything but confusing to the \
reader who has not yet read the 1
"Saga."
This book is even more intimate i
in character than its predecessor, j
Galsworthy lets us further into the :
true characters of Soames the three j
Jolyons and Timothy and his sisters
with these glimpses at small but re- 1
vealing incidents in their life, until j
it seems hard to believe that they
are not real people.
The stories are spread over a long ;
period from the time of old "Super
ior Dosset" Forsyte, that worthy j
brick-mason who founded the fam
ily fortune in the first decade of the
19th century, down to Soames,
watching the dissolution of the old
regime in the World War.
