Who is that man, oh father dear,
That runs so fast and far?
His name is Wallace Denny, child,
He surely needs a car.
That's poetry for an unsung hero,
written in a spirit of practical
friendliness, if nothing else worth
mentioning. What would football's
broken noses and blistered heels do
if this leathery sprinter - trainer
failed to be on hand with his black
valise, during a rest period? But it
takes effort for him to get there.
Why not install a gasoline en
gine in the towel - and - water
wagon, and let him ride in state
to wherever he's most needed?
And that's good material for a
theme song, isn't it?— Stanford's
football trainer sings, 'I'm on
the Water Wagon Now-w-w-w."

New automobiles, old automobiles,
pseudo-automobiles, are all very
well, but we're beginning to wonder
if there aren't too many of the
darned things on campus. Especially
so when we think of students who
continue to leave cars in the "No
Parking" area by the Union, despite
requests and warnings!
And we can't understand how
anyone can be so anxious to reach
a sweet-scented Chemistry lab that
he parks on the sidewalk or wher

; ever else his engine happens to stop.
The University is built of
sandstone — cement sidewalks
won't stand so much abuse!
Anyhow, why can't we park
where parking's allowed, and
j save fine-money for week-end
i celebrations, or something?
Huh?

With the progress of football sea
son and later late-leaves for women
112 students, we're wondering about the
$5 they traditionally carry on "Sat
urday nights out." With the extra
: hour added, will they stuff $7.50 in
their movie-esque stocking-tops? i
Maybe — and there'll doubtless be
i some rule about refunds if the girls

And now, European History
expresses an opinion on the
woman question—if there is a
woman question. According to
a campus authority (and he used
to be a Stanford student, loo),
women are "a natural calamity,
and a necessary evil; it's a sin
to leave 'em. and a torture to
keep 'em."
It's nice to have it formulated so
I completely, for us. Sort of drastic,
\ of course, but then—it's that sort of
! problem.

Why not install a gasoline en
gine in the towel - and - water
wagon, and let him ride in state
to wherever he's most needed?

New automobiles, old automobiles,
pseudo-automobiles, are all very
well, but we're beginning to wonder
if there aren't too many of the
darned things on campus. Especially
so when we think of students who
continue to leave cars in the "No
Parking" area by the Union, despite
requests and warnings!
And we can't understand how
anyone can be so anxious to reach
a sweet-scented Chemistry lab that
he parks on the sidewalk or wher

; ever else his engine happens to stop.
The University is built of
sandstone — cement sidewalks
won't stand so much abuse!
Anyhow, why can't we park
where parking's allowed, and
j save fine-money for week-end
i celebrations, or something?
Huh?

With the progress of football sea

112 students, we're wondering about the

their movie-esque stocking-tops? i

And now, European History
expresses an opinion on the
woman question—if there is a
woman question. According to
a campus authority (and he used
to be a Stanford student, loo),
women are "a natural calamity,
and a necessary evil; it's a sin
to leave 'em. and a torture to
keep 'em."
It's nice to have it formulated so
I completely, for us. Sort of drastic,
\ of course, but then—it's that sort of
! problem.
Who is that man, oh father dear,
That runs so fast and far?
His name is Wallace Denny, child,
He surely needs a car.
That's poetry for an unsung hero,
written in a spirit of practical
friendliness, if nothing else worth
mentioning. What would football's
broken noses and blistered heels do
if this leathery sprinter - trainer
failed to be on hand with his black
valise, during a rest period? But it
takes effort for him to get there.
