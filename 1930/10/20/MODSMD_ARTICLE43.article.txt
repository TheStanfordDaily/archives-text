The most important bit of college
news in a long time is the refusal
by Harvard to allow Rudy Valee to
sing the college's songs over the
radio and a similar refusal to Buddy
Rogers to use "Crimson" songs in
the talkies.
It is radio crooners and "col
legiate" pictures that have given
the public the idea that college
students wake up singing har
mony, varsity-dragging all over
the campus, tap dance before
and after every meal, and neck
in every rumble seat.
Consistency is the jewel of life,
so the Kansas University dramatic
department is holding secret "prac
tices" for their coming mystery
play.
The Vassar News proposes a
"Vassar School for Men" to be
operated in connection with the col
lege—somewhat similar to the local
idea to operate a "Stanford School
for Women."
Both plans are based on the
fallacy that institutions main
tain their original coveted char
acter no matter how changed
they may become.
Bring 2.000 women to Stanford
and the "farm" would change to a
"dude ranch"; the "rough" would
be revamped into a "lounge-lizard";
the quad would be a fashion prome
nade; and the professor's ofTce
would be so full of apple-polishing
femmes that we would never get a
chance—that is a chance to talk to
the professor.
It's hard to say just what
would happen if 2,000 men were
brought to Vassar.
Women at the University of Texas
will be taught to select dresses to
suit their particular personality.
We feel that "simple" lines should
go over in a big way; and black
(the absence of color) should also
prove popular.
