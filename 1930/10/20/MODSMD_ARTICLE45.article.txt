FOOD-LOVING ANTS
. The Editor, Sir:
If there are any students who are
! studying the habits and actions of
ANTS they need go no great dis
tance to obtain any number which
' they may require for their experi
ments.
The second floor of Branner Hall
is a wondertui home for ANTS.
Over here at Branner we have all
kinds of food. Each morning one
may go through the hall and the
smell of cooking is indeed notice
able. The electric stoves are a great
help to those who do not care to
leave their rooms for breakfast. It
is very strange that ANTS should
j be attracted by food, but the fact re
mains that ANTS also like good
food.
With all respect to those who like
the comfort of dining in their own
rooms and as sorry as I feel for thp
ANTS I certainly wish that the
proper authorities would take action
against both of the above nuisances.
