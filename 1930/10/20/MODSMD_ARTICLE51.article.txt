State 7.
Stanford 13, Oregon State 7.
Two touchdowns difference . . .
the Trojans will be top-heavy fa
vorites next week . . . Stanford's
second string made five first downs
to O.S.C.'s none in the first quar
ter ... . and three to the Beavers'
two first downs in the second quar
ter before substitutions . . .
Two touchdowns within five min
utes . . . the boys can play foot
ball . . . does everyone think that
five minutes of real football is all
a Stanford team is capable of . . .
but when an outfit lacks fire it does
not play football . . . how many
passes from Rothert did Moffatt
miss by an inch? . . . touchdown
passes they were, too ~ . . that
O.S.C. pass for their score came
from about the same spot as U.S.C.'s
touchdown pass last year . . .
Warner found another right half
Saturday . . . Caddel is FAST . . .
poor Bill Clark . . . his last year
and now third best man for the
post . . . Caglieri seems to have lost
nothing by his lay-off . . . that
shoulder bothered him when he
missed his pass, though . . . he in
tercepted a pass without thinking
of it . . .
Oregon State completed two lucky
passes . . . but how . . . four men
had their hands on the ball each
time . . . this guy McKalip must
have played keep-away early in
life . . . it's the same technique . . .
Pop aged considerably Saturday
. . . that third quarter never seemed
to end . . . Schissler did some walk
ing, too . . . also some talking.
Jernegan phoning the Chronicle:
' What? You say Buerke comes from
Peoria? What do I care about that?"
. . . Irwin on the phone for the
Examiner: "Yet, it's time out . . .
1 don't know what they're doing
. . . no, nothing is happening . . .
lhe linesmen's chain broke." . . . .
a sweet time everyone had with all
the Oregon players dashing in with
unlisted numbers . . . and plenty
whose names were listed under
numbers other than those which
thte'y wore ....
Stanford's interference seemed
slow . . . Rothert's interference got
in his way at times . . . noticed most
of the reverses from C came from
the quarterback position . . . makes
them speedier . . . al|o the quarter
back shifted from right to left in
C formation instead of remaining on
the right as he has heretofore . . .
the Cards used some cut-backs, too
, . . fighting fire with fire . . ,
wonder what Jones has concocted
for Saturday . . .
Bardin went in with his ankle
brace . . . and it had to be taped
. . . Bardin's work has Ihe same
stamp as Neill's . . . finished . . .
whatever they do turns out to be
right . . . Taylor's passing was
spotty . . . Hammer was plenty of
opposition though ... a fine cen
ter . . . he intercepted too many
Card tosses . . .
Band, red pants . . . quite a con
trast . . . both teams with white
sweatshirts , . . must have helped the
passers . . . Neill trying on four
helmets before going in . . . three
plays later Neill is bareheaded . . .
Dana did not bounce around so
much . . . perhaps the upkeep on
knickers proved too expensive . . .
it took plenty to penalize Stanford
15 lor Pop's stalk onto the field . . .
and then to sock Schissler for his
forensic move too . . .
They will crucify Price again this
week . . . Ik' 11 probably beat Wash
ington . . . Oregon must now defeat
Oregon State . . . can Washnigton

Southern California 27, Oregon
State 7.
Stanford 13, Oregon State 7.
Two touchdowns difference . . .
the Trojans will be top-heavy fa
vorites next week . . . Stanford's
second string made five first downs
to O.S.C.'s none in the first quar
ter ... . and three to the Beavers'
two first downs in the second quar
ter before substitutions . . .
Two touchdowns within five min
utes . . . the boys can play foot
ball . . . does everyone think that
five minutes of real football is all
a Stanford team is capable of . . .
but when an outfit lacks fire it does
not play football . . . how many
passes from Rothert did Moffatt
miss by an inch? . . . touchdown
passes they were, too ~ . . that
O.S.C. pass for their score came
from about the same spot as U.S.C.'s
touchdown pass last year . . .
