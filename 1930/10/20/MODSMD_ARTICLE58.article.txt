# BABE SOCCER MEN BEAT LOWELL HIGH 5-1 IN WEAK GAME
## 
### 
After dallying through the first
half with no score, the Stanford
freshman soccer team imbibed some
pep from Coach Harry Maloney's
exhortations between the halves
and crushed Lowell High School
under a 5-1 score Saturday after
noon in the preliminary to the
varsity-Rover encounter.
Led by Hern at center forward,
the frosh put on a better exhibition
of soccer than they did against
Commerce last week.
