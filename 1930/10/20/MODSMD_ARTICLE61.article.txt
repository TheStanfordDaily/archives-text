"Americanism cannot be pre
served in alcohol,"' says 19-year-old
William M. Plymat, Stanford fresh
man, who achieved national promi
nence in his high school days in
Mankato, Minn., as founder of the
Student Sobriety Society and editor
of the society's monthly publication,
"The Student American" or "The
Voice of Sobriety."
The paper, which is devoted to
the promotion of prohibition, is still
published in Minnesota, but is soon
to be moved to Palo Alto. The Stu
dent Sobriety Society has branches
in 24 states, and recruits from 400
schools. The formation of a Stan
ford chapter is under way.
