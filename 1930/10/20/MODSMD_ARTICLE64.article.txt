# THE 						COUGAR'S COACH
## 
### Feg Murray 
Out in the Far West they are
acclaiming one O. E. "Babe" Hol
lingbery as a "Miracle Man." He is
the coach of the team that beat both
California and Southern California
on successive Saturdays. The Cou
gars, as the Washington State team
of Pullman, Washington, is called,
proved to be a clawing, scrapping
bunch of wildcats, for after travel
ing to Berkeley to defeat California
16 to 0 they entertained Howard
Jones's Trojans at home on October
11 and beat them 7 to 6. W.S.C. has
not lost a game on its home field
since "Babe" Hollingbery took over
the job of coaching them. Beating
California is not a new stunt with
"Babe" either, as he formerly
coached the Olympic Club of San
Francisco that first upset the Golden
Bears during the "Wonder Team"
era.
Last year the Cougars won ten
games and lost to California and
Southern California. In 1928 they
lost to the same two universities,
and to Washington as well.

A gent named Ellingsen proved
to be the Cougar's main claw in
the defeat of U.S.C., for it was the
passing, punting, and defense work
of this fine all-around star that
ruined the Trojans more than any
thing else. Ellingsen plays left half
back, and is ably assisted by Ton
kin, quarter, Lainhart, right half,
and Schwartz, fullback.
It is interesting to note that where
two famous coaches, Spears and
Phelan, have taken up new jobs and
threatened to end the long reign of
California's "Big Three," an over
looked youngster, practically un
known in the East, rises up and
steals their thunder by trimming
Howard Jones's team and Nibs
Price's team before Oregon and
Washington get a crack at their
hated rivals from the Pacific South
west. Washington State does not
play Stanford this season.
Hollingbery's first name is Orion.
In Greek mythology, Orion was a
giant and a hunter. But 1 bet he
never killed a Bear and a Trojan
within the space of eight days!
