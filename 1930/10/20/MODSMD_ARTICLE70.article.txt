# CLUBHOUSE WILL BE COMPLETED ON GOLF COURSE THIS MONTH
## 
### 
With but a few of the final details
left to be completed, the new club
house of the University golf course
will be ready for use within a few
days of the end of this month, ac
cording to A 1 Masters, graduate
manager of the B.A.C.
The clubhouse was built under a
$46,000 contract, and will complete
the golf building program which
was started with the awarding of a
$155,000 contract a year and a half
ago for the construction of the
course. The completion of the club
house will put the golfing facilities
at Stanford on a par with the best
in the country, Masters says.
Both men's and women's locker
rooms will be provided, with a
lounge room and a light lunch
fountain, which will be for use of
students as well as outside mem
bers.
Locker fees for students will be
about a dollar per month.
