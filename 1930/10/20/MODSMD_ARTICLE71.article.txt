# INTERCLASS TOUCH FOOTBALL GAMES TO BE PLAYED TODAY
## 
### 
Opening games of the fall inter
class touch football competition will
be played this afternoon at 3 o'clock
between seniors and juniors, and
sophomores and freshmen. The for
mer game will be played on the
freshman field and the latter on the
Gray field.
Parker Reed, who is handling the
play, wants to remind all the class
presidents that it is up to them to
see that teams are organized by
game time today. Seven men will
be required for each.
The interclass grid championship
was won last year by the class of
'30 with the class of '33 second.
