# FRESHMAN GRIDDERS PREPARE FOR GAME WITH SAINT MARY'S
## 
### 
With the U.C.L.A. freshman
eleven safely subdued by the very
decisive margin of 21 to 6, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw will now devote
his entire attention to grooming his
warriors for their fray with the
Saint Mary's babes Saturday pre
liminary to the varsity-U.S.C. tilt.
Expecting a lot of opposition last
Saturday from the Bruin cubs down
south, the Caj'ds found little trouble
awaiting them. With Maentz at left
half for the yearlings leading the
attack, Bradshaw's men gained al
most at will against the Bruins.
Besides converting all three points
after the Card scores, Maentz in the
first quarter galloped thirty-five
yards for a touchdown, and later
carried the ball over for another
score on a three-yard plunge
through the line.
In the Saint babe eleven, Brad
shaw will be up against one of the
best freshman teams in this terri
tory. Last week the Gael outfit over
ran the California youngsters to the
tune of 22 to 7. Jack Baat, who was
captain of the Mission High grid
men last year, led the attack.
With California definitely out of
the running after being routed by
U.S.C. Saturday, the result of the
coming Saint contest will establish
the logical contender to battle things
out with Southern California for
yearling honors.
