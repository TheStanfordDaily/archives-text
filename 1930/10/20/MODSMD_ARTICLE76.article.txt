Action Is Definite
Edward Hathcock, chairman of the
Welfare Board which recommended
the probationary action to the Coun
cil, said: "The Council has taken a
very definite stand, and every ef
fort will be made to enforce the
rules of probation."
These rules provide that during
the probation, which is to be in ef
fect until December 15 or later, the
organizations on probation may hold
no pledging or social functions, or
be represented in inter-society as
sociations.
Ten of the organizations on pro
bation had planned social functions
for Saturday evening, October 18.
The Welfare Board, Hathcock
stated, will take any action neces
sary, to the extent of withdrawing
the University charter, of any or
ganization violating the prabation
rules.
