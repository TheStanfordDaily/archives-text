NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 19. l/Plâ€”
Distinct earthquake terrors today
shook thirteen or more towns and
cities of Southeastern Louisiana, in
cluding New Orleans, but no dam
age of any consequence was re
ported.
The earthquake occurred about
6:15 o'clock, literally shaking some
residents of New Orleans and sur
rounding regions out of their beds.
Thousands of telephone calls poured
into newspaper offices from persons
feeling the shock and wishing in
formation.
Doubt existed as to whether two
tremors occurred, or only one.
Some narrators were positive there
were two shocks, about five minutes
apart. It was definite that the first
tremble lasted a full thirty seconds.
In Plaquemines, La., about 85
miles northwest of New Orleans, the
quake was severe enough to shake
the glass from street lights.
