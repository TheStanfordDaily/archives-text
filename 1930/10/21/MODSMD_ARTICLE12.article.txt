# 'NIBS' PRICE CALLS 'POP' POOR SPORT
## Ineligibility Of Bican Laid To Stanford Coach's 'Petty Sleuthing' 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif., Oct. 20.â€”(/P).
Bitterly denouncing the tactics that
led to Nick Bican, University of
California tackle being declared in
eligible last week, Coach C. M.
"Nibs" Price today laid the blame
to Coach Glenn Warner of Stan
ford.
"It was the most unsportsmanlike
thing I have heard of," Coach Price
said in referring to what he termed
"Warner's petty sleuthing."
"If it takes such detective work
to be a football coach at Stanford, I
am glad I haven't got the job. And
if Warner thinks it will do him and
his team any good in the 'Big Game',
he is wrong."
Bican was declared ineligible on
a transfer rule. It was discovered he
played freshman football at Willa
mette College before transferring to
Sacramento Junior College, where
he played a year before he came to
California. This gives him three
years of football, which made him
ineligible under a conference rule.
