# START WORK ON GATEWAY WITHIN WEEK
## Plans For Drive Entrance Include Landscaping, Sandstone Arches 
### 
Work on the new gateway at the
Palm Drive entrance to the uni
versity will be started within the
next week according to Almon E.
Roth, comptroller of the University.
Improvements at the Palm Drive
entrance will consist of two sand
stone arches with red tiled roof and
low sandstone walls which will ex
tend on either side of the arches.
Flowers, shrubs, and grass will
complete the new landscape.
Formation of new plans for the
arches have caused the delay in the
construction, Roth said. After set
ting up the dummy arches, it was
found that the arches would have to
be two feet higher in order that they
might be in correct proportion to the
rest of the landscape.
The selling of university property
for the widening of the state high
way supplied the University with
the necessary money to carry on the
project, Roth said, and gifts from
alumni are expected to carry the
rest of the costs. Plans for two
fountains to be placed at the new
entrance have been abandoned, as
the expense would be too great.
The contracts for the project were
let to George Wagner, general con
tractor and McGilvray Bros., stone
workers. John Bakewell and Arthur
Brown, university architects, drew
the plans.
