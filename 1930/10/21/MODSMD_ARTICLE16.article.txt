## 
### 
i Patty Baker, who has been con
fined in the Children's Hospital in
j San Francisco for the past two
J weeks suffering from a severe case
iof poliomyelitis, has shown a
j marked improvement over the
j week-end, according to a report re
j ccived yesterday by the University
j health offices.
The patient will probably be put
in a plaster cast today, since an
I essential part of the treatment for
| the malady is complete rest for the
! parts of the body in which the in
fection has settled. Though she has
been quite ill, the doctors are ex
ceedingly optimistic concerning her
complete recovery.
