## 
### 
Returning yesterday from Los
Angeles .where he addressed the
University of Southern California
student body at an assembly Friday
morning, Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, declared such friendly mani
festations on the part of the two
universities of Stanford and U.S.C.
were of deep value.
"The annual visit of the associ
ated student president to the U.S.C.
campus and the return visit of the
Southern president to Stanford, pro
vide each school with a better in
sight into and a more intelligent
understanding of its rival institu
tion," Pike stated. "Mutual ex
change of ideas and experiences in
various phases of student govern
ment and student life is permitted.
It will lead to good will if anything
will, as it forms a basis for friendly
relations."
The student body president cited
"the average person's conception of
good will assemblies as being occa
sions on which meaningless, hypo
critical platitudes are expressed," as
the principle objection to such gath
erings, in his mind.
Cordial Welcome
Pike declared that he was re
ceived by the Southern California
student body tnd their president,
Lewis Gough, with a genuine
warmth and cordiality. A luncheon
was given in his honor by Gough.

) attended by the Dean of Men, the
Dean of Women, several members
of the Board of Trustees, and the
student body officers.
In his address before the assem
bly, among other matters, Pike
stated that he cleared up the mis
understanding between Coaches
"Pop" Warner and Howard Jones
as the result of an alleged state
ment of Warner's that Jones was a
poor sport. Warner was also alleged
to have accused the Southern Cali
fornia mentor of coaching his team
to evade the rules of the game.
"Pop" Praises Jones
"Pop said nothing of the sort and
has the highest regard for Howard
Jones as a football coach and a
gentleman," Pike told the gather
ing. "He has been misquoted by
i newspapers. He merely said that
the U.S.C. team did not conform
i strictly last year to the 'approxi
-1 mately a minute stop' rule regulat
ing backfield motion before a play,
i and-he attributed that failing to
either leniency on the part of the
, officials or over-nervousness on the
I part of the players."
The student body president de
clared that there was an intense
feeling at U.S.C. in regard to the
clash with Stanford on the gridiron
Saturday, and that the general im
pression was that it would be an
uphill battle for the Southern team
