# CABINET STUDIES UNEMPLOYMENT
## Emphasis Is Placed Upon Prompt Action 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. (/P)â€”The
wintry weather which has already
brought suffering to some sections
of the country acting as a spur, the
cabinet committee created by Persi
dent Hoover to work toward relief
of unemployment during the winter
months was called for its first meet
ing today. Every emphasis was
placed upon the necessity for prompt
and decisive action.
It was considered probable that
appropriations for new federal pro
jects would be speeded in Congress
to furnish jobs for men out of work.
In the conferences with leaders in
business and industry the govern
ment officials, headed by Secretary
of Commerce Thomas Lamont, pre
paratory to today's meeting, were
concerned largely with ascertaining
what industries could put produc
tion schedules ahead to provide for
employment this winter.
The President's committee also
had before it the plan to make a
complete survey of public building
projects and a review of the high
way and harbor work with a view
to seeing that appropriation and ne
cessity for employment coincide as
much as possible.
