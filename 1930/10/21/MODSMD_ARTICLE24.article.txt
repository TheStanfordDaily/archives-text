# CONCERT THRILLS LARGE AUDIENCE
## Captain Taylor Branson Is Popular Conductor 
### Catherine Spaulding 
Thrilling an enthusiastic crowd of
children in the afternoon and ap
pealing equally to the more formal
evening audience, the United States
Marine Band, led by Captain Taylor
Branson, gave the first concert of
the A.S.S.U. series last night, in
the Pavilion.
In the afternoon, a popular pro
gram of selections including Victor
Herbert, Dvorak, Bach, and Liszt,
was given, interspersed with
marches and popular songs which
delighted the young audience. Chil
dren hanging over the railings and
keeping time with their hands
thrilled to the well-known marches,
"American Patrol," "Stars and
Stripes Forever," "Parade of the
Gendarmes," and "Boxer Rebellion."
Winfred Kemp, cornet soloist of
the afternoon, played "Hungarian
Melodies" and was repeatedly en
cored for popular songs. His inter
pretation of such songs as "Dancing
With Tears in My Eyes" recalled
the history of the band when it was
first made popular playing at the
balls and social affairs of Dolly
Madison. Wilbur Keffer, xylophone
soloist, was also popularly received.
Perhaps one of the beft-liked
numbers in both programs was
"Whistler and His Dog." And the
band surprised the audiences with
"The Cardinal Is Waving."
In the evening J.he solo numbers
"Mother Machree,' "The Bells of
St. Mary," given by Arthur Whit
comb, cornetist, and "Little Mother
o' Mine" and "Dear Little Girl,"
played by Robert E. Clark, trom
bone player, were beautifully given
and enthusiastically received.
Noticeable throughout the pro
gram was the polished technique
and the finished playing of the
group not only as a band but as an
orchestra. The transition from
woodwinds to brass and back again
was often accomplished without the
audience becoming aware of the
change, and the woodwinds gave
all the delicacy of strings in a sym
phony orchestra.
