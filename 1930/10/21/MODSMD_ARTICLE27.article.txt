# BARS DROPPED; WARNER MOLDS CARD OFFENSE
## "Pop" Silent As To Price's Attitude Over Bican Ineligibility TANDY BACK IN LINEUP 
### Len Kallmann 
Revoking all secret practice passes
for this week, Coach Glenn Warner
last night held his first "secret"
secret practice of the season. The
52 Cards, Warner, the manager-,
and a few others shared the inti
macy of the practice session which
the Old Fox devoted to polishing
his offense for the clash with the
Thundering Herd.
"I have nothing to say. Let Price
do the talking," -Warner said last
night when approached regarding
Bican's ineligibility and Price's sub
sequent protest. In Warner's defense,
it should be known that in the first
place Pop had nothing to do with
the investigation, and in the second
place Stanford did not protest
Bican, but merely requested an in
vestigation of his record.
Tandy Works Out
At last night's practice, Hillman,
Wittcnau, and Laborde were the
only men not in moleskins, while
Tandy, Hand, and Bardin all worked
out with the team. It is expected
that all of the men, with the excep
tion of Henri Laborde, will be in
shape to play Saturday.
Four sophomore managers, posted
on the four corners of the field,
stood grim watch over Ihe tin-plated
knot-holes until night fell yester
day. Not even curious members of
the Stanford baseball squad were
permitted to peak at the Warner
men.
Mistakes Corrected
In direct contrast to what might
have been expected, Warner neither
scolded nor berated the men for
their showing Saturday. Realizing
that it will take all of the effort the
men have when the Trojans invade
the Stadium Saturday, Pop did not
drive the squad as he did toward
the middle of last week, but instead
concentrated on the mistakes made
in the clash with the Beavers.
The Cards can thank their lucky
stars that they came through the
Oregonian invasian with a minimum
of casualties. While several of the
men were forced to watch practice
from the sidelines yesterday, today
should find all save Laborde cavort
ing about the turf. And Stanford
will need every man Saturday to
turn back the Thundex-ing Herd.
