# THOSE WHO FLUNK
## 
### 
I "nivcrsity students who flunk out of school are divided into
three groups by Dean Christian (iauss of Princeton, who seeks to
answer the question. "Why Students Fail?"
The first type are those who lack the intelligence required to do
college work. These can be largely eliminated by stiffer entrance
examinations. The second group comprises the "sad cases": those
who suffer physical handicaps or financial worries. Fortunately this
group is small.
II is the third class that worries Dean < iauss. These are the men
and women who, lacking interest iu their studies, devote too much
time to outside interests.
Student interest is certain to lag until university authorities
revise the antiquated curricula, which have held over from our
great-grandfathers, to meet modern conditions.
