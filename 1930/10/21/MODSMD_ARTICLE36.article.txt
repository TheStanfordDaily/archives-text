THE FOOLS' PARADE. By John
W. Vandercook. Harper's. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
The author of the unusual and
powerful Black Majesty has slapped
together a conventional group of
tales, only one of which has the
plantive quality, without the
strength, of his earlier volume.
Whenever one writes of negroes
and whites in the jungles of Gooby
Gooby there must appear, it seems,
certain familiar elements: the girl
who comes to the wilds to marry
her lover; the Englishmen who sit
indolently about drinking whisky
and sodas and scoffing .too soon at
black magic, for they must be left
petrified with fear by some super
natural phenomena before you dare
end the tale; the escapes from, a
penal colony who expire within
sight of civilization after struggling
through a thousand miles of jungle;
the natural element which inevi
tably triumphs over mere man; the
oppression of negroes whq serve
white men.
From this last near-platitude
Vandercook has formed a tender,
rather pitiful, little tale which he
unfortunately tinges with melo

drama. It is quite the best thing in
the book. —J. S. S.
SHEPHERDS IN SACKCLOTH. By
Sheila Kaye-Smith. Harper
Bros. 19:10.
In an environment all its own, in
an existence timeless though cus
toms change, the small village of
thalched roofed Delnionden basks
in the care of its pastor.
One of his '"flock" escapee to fol
low (he gypsies to their little non
conformist church. She is youth,
eager lor life. She is Terry, taking
the love of the poor young preacher
of the gypsies' church, and making
it carry him to a great mission as
evangelist, after his sin, her death,
and his rescue by the Delmonden
pastor.
Two "shepherds in sackcloth"
they become; the old pastor sinning
because he administers spiritually,
not ritually, according to the gospel
of the bishops.
Sheila Kaye-Smith has caught a
bit of life, and made it poignant and
beautiful. It is not a great novel,
but sincere in its representation of
country folk, and fine in its pathos
of innocent trust in two so different
shepherds. —J. N.
