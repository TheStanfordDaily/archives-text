ABOUT THOSE SIGNALS
The Editor, Sir:
It is a well known fact that the
Stanford Rough dislikes seeing old
traditions pass, but I. for one (and
I'm not alone in the matter) believe
that the time has come for the
passing of the age-old custom of
"lacking up" at the intersection of
Palm Drive and the State Highway.
Last year, one of the "Powers-
That-Be" made a statement in the
Daily to the effect that signals
would be installed at the dangerous
intersection in the near future.
This "promise," or rather, "threat,"
was postponed (more or less indefi
nitely, one would gather) until the
paving of the highway. Perhaps
these "Powers-That-Be" have "for
gotten" about the signals; or per
haps ihe controlling factor in the
selection of ihe new hospital site
was the proximity of the site to
the intersection. At any rate, all
Stanford autoists would greatly ap
preciate the installation of bells,
lights, or what-have-you.
Sincerely, '32.
