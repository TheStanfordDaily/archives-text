BERKELEY, Oct. 20. (/P) —To the
world at large Russ Avery, six foot
two inch senior student at the Uni
versity of California, is a football
hero. He's a varsity end—and a
good one.

is a compromise between palette and
pigskin. He is enrolled in art courses
which call for his attention from 8
o'clock in the morning until 5
o'clock in the afternoon. "But I
manage to sneak out a bit early to
show up for football practice," he
admitted.
He does oils, including portrait
work, pencil sketching, and clay
modeling. He's planning on a year
of graduate work here, after he is
no longer eligible for football.
