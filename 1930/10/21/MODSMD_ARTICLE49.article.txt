FIGHT TALK
While the echoes of the Oregon
State encounter are still ringing in
fraternity houses and halls, and
while the Stanford varsity is being
called everything from "dumb" to
"dubs" and back again, the most
remarkable feature on the Farm at
present is the confidence of the
Cardinals in the team.
Not a registered student, with
possibly a few exceptions, but feels
that the Warnennen can win Sat
urday. On the basis of the Stanford
and Southern California seasons to
dale, there is not a leg for such a
belief to stand upon, but none the
less the feeling exists.
Howard Jones, according to our
secret operative and undercover
agent, has already promised alumni
and students that the Trojans will
fight for sixty minutes Saturday
against Stanford. There is nothing
Jones could prefer to a third suc
cess at Warner's expense, and he
can be trusted to have his men at
a peak for the game.
Ami a defeat by Jones would
mean nothing but sackcloth and
ashes for the Cardinal mentor. If
Warner could get out there on the
liehl and call signals for the team,
lie would at least be certain that
his plays were getting a fair break.
As il is he must chew cigarettes
and pace up and down in the hope
(hat someone will have a brain
storm and call plays with a dash
of deception.
Stanford played a whole game
without a fake reverse Saturday. To
any person who sat in the stands
during the Stanford-Army game of
1929, it seems impossible that the
players could have forgotten the
devastation wrought in the Cadet's
ranks by Smalling's faking. Those
who can recall the distant past
when "Bift" Hoffman was fullback
can also remember how the spin
plays, fakes, and hidden ball stunts
were worked.
The beauty of the Warner system,
in theory, lies in the fact that the
defense may be sucked in by line
plays or sucked out by laterals and
reverses. It is the duty of the men
(o watch their opponents' defense
and throw plays at the weaknesses
presented. Successes of the Stanford
varsity have always been preceded
by clever manipulation of the War
ner bag of tricks.
If the theory has been demon
strated in the past, it can be demon
strated in the present. But what as
surance is there that the 1930 edi
tion of the Redshirts will suddenly
start thinking, instead of letting
their offense consist of a reverse io
the right, a reverse to the left, a
pass, and a punt?
Stanford must be thinking Satur
day. Stanford will be fighting
against the Trojans, for the Cards
want lo win as badly as the student
body wants them to win. A team
can be roused to the apex of rar
ing. tearing fury by the goads of
press, public, and coach during the
course of a week, and the Redshirts
will be goaded and baited this week.
Stanford's fight has turned defeat
into victory before. Fumbles cost
the Redshirts a victory in 1928. In
juries cost the Redshirts a victory
in 1929. Will Stanford's fight be
nullified by thick-wittedness in
191)0? Will the fight triumph in
spite of the dumbness? Or will
brains and intestinal fortitude com
bine in leading to a Big Red day
October 25? Time alone will tell.
