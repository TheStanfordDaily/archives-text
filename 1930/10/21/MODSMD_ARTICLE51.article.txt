### Stewart Crawford 
While Warner's varsity grid men
| are working in secret for the South
| ern California tussle Saturday,
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw, though
scrimmaging his yearling Redshirts
; right out in the open, is nevertheless
\ working just as hard in preparation
for a tough till with the Saint
Mary's babes preliminary to the
varsity contest.
Though the Saint freshmen have
| only one game of any account be
hind them, they have come through
! the season thus far undefeated.
Among the lesser luminaries that
| have fallen before the Gaels are the
i Marin J.C. eleven, St. Ignatius, and
1 the San Francisco Eagles.
In taking California by a score of
22 to 7 two weeks ago, the Saint
Mary's outfit showed that it is a
team to be feared by any yearling
eleven. The Saints, led by one Jack
Baat, former Mission High captain,
put it all over the Bears that after
noon.
The Card babes, however, proved
beyond doubt that they are an out
standing contender for freshman
honors when they downed a fight
ing U.C.L.A. team in the South
Saturday. The 21 to 6 score hardly
indicates how good Bradshaw's men
really looked in this tilt.
The Redshirts got off to a good
start and in the first half surprised
the optimistic U.C.L.A. eleven by
scoring three touchdowns in suc
cession. In the last half the play
was mostly in the Bruin territory,
but aided by severe penalties, the
Bruins managed to ward off the
Card threats and snag a touchdown
of their own.
Bradshaw is figuring on an even
tussle Saturday against the St.
Mary's freshmen, though the Gaels
may be said to have the edge. So
far this season they have not had
any tough contests, while the Card
babes have been battered hard in
downing such stellar elevens as the
Sacramento J.C. and the Bronco
yearlings.
Last week the Saints coasted
easily over the San Francisco Eagles,
while the Redshirts received several
injuries in the South.
However the yearling mentor has
Miller for the wing position and

Lipscomb for the berth at full, both
of these men having shown well in
alternating thus far this season.
