# THREE ANN ARBOR FAVORITES
## "Hurry-Up" Yost Real Head Coach of Michigan Team; Invented Most Successful Trick Play 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Coach "Hurry-Up" Yost will al
ways be associated with Michigan
football. Even though he is theo
retically in retirement, in reality he
is the head coach of the Wolverines
and has the last word in planning
the campaigns against the various
opponents that the Maize and Blue
must meet on the gridiron. I sat in
Yost's handsome limousine with him
in the pouring rain the afternoon
after Michigan's defeat of Harvard
at Ann Arbor last year and asked
the Coach to diagram "Old 83" for
me. Now "Old 83" is a trick play
that Coach "Hurry-Up" worked out
about three decades ago and I had
sat in utter amazement the after
noon before at the complete and
mystifying success of this remark
able play.
I still have Yost's diagram, but no
one can make much out of it, and
old "Hurry-Up" meant it to be that
way. "I won't tell you exactly how
il goes," he said, and proceeded to
draw something that looked like the
scratchings my son and heir makes
when he draws a "choo choo train."
Briefly, "Old 83"—the most suc

i cessful trick play in football— is a
lake tackle thrust that is almost al
ways used between the 20- and 35-
yard lines as a sure touchdown get
ter. The play is used after several
line bucks, and starts out a? a drive
against the opponent's left side. A
back starts to the right as the play
goes into the line, but reverses and
comes back to his starting position
unnoticed by the defense. All of a
sudden the ball is shot back to him
out ol the heap of players and he
I tears around his left flank, preceded
: by his right guard and tackle. I be
lieve the left end takes the ball from
the quarter, and when the proper
moment arrives he tosses it back to
Ihe carrier. At any rate, it's a wow!
"Germany" Schultz, greatest of all
centers, is almost as much a Michi
gan institution as Yost, and Willie
Heston, greatest halfback of all
time. Johnny Maulbetsch, "the Ger
man Mauser bullet," who shot
through opposing lines like a pro
jectile, is another old-time
gan hero.

Ihe carrier. At any rate, it's a wow!
"Germany" Schultz, greatest of all
centers, is almost as much a Michi
gan institution as Yost, and Willie
Heston, greatest halfback of all
time. Johnny Maulbetsch, "the Ger
man Mauser bullet," who shot
through opposing lines like a pro
jectile, is another old-time
gan hero.

Coach "Hurry-Up" Yost will al
ways be associated with Michigan
football. Even though he is theo
retically in retirement, in reality he
is the head coach of the Wolverines
and has the last word in planning
the campaigns against the various
opponents that the Maize and Blue
must meet on the gridiron. I sat in
Yost's handsome limousine with him
in the pouring rain the afternoon
after Michigan's defeat of Harvard
at Ann Arbor last year and asked
the Coach to diagram "Old 83" for
me. Now "Old 83" is a trick play
that Coach "Hurry-Up" worked out
about three decades ago and I had
sat in utter amazement the after
noon before at the complete and
mystifying success of this remark
able play.
I still have Yost's diagram, but no
one can make much out of it, and
old "Hurry-Up" meant it to be that
way. "I won't tell you exactly how
il goes," he said, and proceeded to
draw something that looked like the
scratchings my son and heir makes
when he draws a "choo choo train."
Briefly, "Old 83"—the most suc

i cessful trick play in football— is a
lake tackle thrust that is almost al
ways used between the 20- and 35-
yard lines as a sure touchdown get
ter. The play is used after several
line bucks, and starts out a? a drive
against the opponent's left side. A
back starts to the right as the play
goes into the line, but reverses and
comes back to his starting position
unnoticed by the defense. All of a
sudden the ball is shot back to him
out ol the heap of players and he
I tears around his left flank, preceded
: by his right guard and tackle. I be
lieve the left end takes the ball from
the quarter, and when the proper
moment arrives he tosses it back to
Ihe carrier. At any rate, it's a wow!
