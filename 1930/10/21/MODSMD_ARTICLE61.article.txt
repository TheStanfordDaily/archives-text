# BILL TRAEGER, FORMER GRID STAR, NOW SHERIFF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY
## 
### 
Still buttling for the light, Bill
Traeger, renowned Stanford foot
ball star of the '"old school," is now
directing his energies in the capa
city of sheriff of Los Angeles
county.
Traeger was one of the numerous
"roughs" who earned their way
through Stanford when David Starr
Jordan was at the helm. Bill cooked
the evening meal for a private fam
ily in Palo Alto.
Later he gained a job as cook
for a group of students who shifted
for themselves in the old boathouse
on Lagunita. In addition to his
duties as cook he edged in a news
paper route for the Daily Palo Alto.
Later Bill organized an eating club
for 17 students and received free
board and room for managing and
founding it.
Unsatisfied with these various
duties, not to mention football,
Traeger took on a job as stage man
ager of the Leland Stanford theater,
for which he received a small sal
ary.
However, these economic ventures
give little indication of the "Wild
Bill" the public viewed with awe.
In 1900 Traeger, then a nationally
famous tackle, won the Big Game
for Stanford by kicking a 43-yard
place-kick. In those days a place
kick counted five points. Stanford
won the game 5 to 0.
Fielding H. "Hurry-Up" Yost
coached that Stanford team. He
went to Michigan the next season

and in his "Thirty Years of Me
moirs," Yost gives Traeger a berth
on his "All American Football Team
of All Time."
In the first football game played
in connection with the Tournament
of Roses at Pasadena, January 1,
1902, which was between Stanford
and Michigan, Bill was playing
tackle. Michigan won, 49 to 0, but
the "never-say-die" tactics of Trae
ger, William K. Roosevelt, and
"Dutch" Bonsback in that game has
never been forgotten.
The ligament cap of Traeger's
shoulder was torn loose, but in
spite of the tearful pleadings of his
teammates he insisted upon remain
ing in the game. Eventually the
team physician strapped Bill's arm
to his side and for the rest of the
game he charged into the Michigan
line like a wild man.
Roosevelt, an end, received a
broken leg in the same game, and
another injured player, Bonsback,
mad? frenzied efforts to get back
into the game on crutches.
Mrs. Stanford had deeded $30,000
to the university in 1901 and Judge
Crothers, a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, attended the
Michigan game carrying the ribbon
which had been tied around the
deed. He intended to give it to the
first man that scored for Stanford,
but since there were no scores, he
cut it into three equal pieces and
gave one to each, Traeger, Roose
velt, and Bonsback.

which had been tied around the
deed. He intended to give it to the
first man that scored for Stanford,
but since there were no scores, he
cut it into three equal pieces and
gave one to each, Traeger, Roose
velt, and Bonsback.
Still buttling for the light, Bill
Traeger, renowned Stanford foot
ball star of the '"old school," is now
directing his energies in the capa
city of sheriff of Los Angeles
county.
Traeger was one of the numerous
"roughs" who earned their way
through Stanford when David Starr
Jordan was at the helm. Bill cooked
the evening meal for a private fam
ily in Palo Alto.
Later he gained a job as cook
for a group of students who shifted
for themselves in the old boathouse
on Lagunita. In addition to his
duties as cook he edged in a news
paper route for the Daily Palo Alto.
Later Bill organized an eating club
for 17 students and received free
board and room for managing and
founding it.
Unsatisfied with these various
duties, not to mention football,
Traeger took on a job as stage man
ager of the Leland Stanford theater,
for which he received a small sal
ary.
However, these economic ventures
give little indication of the "Wild
Bill" the public viewed with awe.
In 1900 Traeger, then a nationally
famous tackle, won the Big Game
for Stanford by kicking a 43-yard
place-kick. In those days a place
kick counted five points. Stanford
won the game 5 to 0.
Fielding H. "Hurry-Up" Yost
coached that Stanford team. He
went to Michigan the next season

and in his "Thirty Years of Me
moirs," Yost gives Traeger a berth
on his "All American Football Team
of All Time."
In the first football game played
in connection with the Tournament
of Roses at Pasadena, January 1,
1902, which was between Stanford
and Michigan, Bill was playing
tackle. Michigan won, 49 to 0, but
the "never-say-die" tactics of Trae
ger, William K. Roosevelt, and
"Dutch" Bonsback in that game has
never been forgotten.
The ligament cap of Traeger's
shoulder was torn loose, but in
spite of the tearful pleadings of his
teammates he insisted upon remain
ing in the game. Eventually the
team physician strapped Bill's arm
to his side and for the rest of the
game he charged into the Michigan
line like a wild man.
Roosevelt, an end, received a
broken leg in the same game, and
another injured player, Bonsback,
mad? frenzied efforts to get back
into the game on crutches.
Mrs. Stanford had deeded $30,000
to the university in 1901 and Judge
Crothers, a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, attended the
Michigan game carrying the ribbon
which had been tied around the
deed. He intended to give it to the
