# FLORIDA KEEPS LOG OF CAMPUS EVENTS
## 
### 
A complete daily chronicle of
every significant event occurring on
the campus of the University of
Florida is now being recorded in
the "Florida Log." The assistant
registrar and the secretary to the
registrar are official scribes for the
book which is claimed by the "Flor
ida Gator," student daily, as the
only one of its kind in any state
university in America.
The "log" is kept in the regis
trar's office where it may be seen
at any time, and an index is kept
so students may find bits of infor
mation whose dates they do not
know. A scrap book has also been
kept of all athletic, social, and per
sonal events of the campus.
