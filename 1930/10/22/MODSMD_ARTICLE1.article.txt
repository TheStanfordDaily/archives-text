# MATTO GROSSO JOINS CAUSE OF BRAZIL REVOLT
## Commander of Government Forces in Cuyaba Leads Revolt FEDERAL LEADER FLEES 
### 
PORTO ALEGRE, Rio Grande do
Sul, Brazil, Oct. 21. (/p)—Brazilian
revolution quarters here today said
that the state of Matto Grosso, sec
ond largest in the Brazilian Union,
had joined the insurgent cause.
Their information was that forces
organized recently in Cuyaba by
Colonel Lima Silva to defend the
federal government i-evolted, and
their commander, Major Ravello, as
sumed presidency of the state.
Colonel Lima Silva, who was chief
of all federal forces in the state with
headquarters at Campo Grande, fled
to the Bolivian frontier with the
seventeenth battalion of cazadores
or scouts, thus avoiding an encoun
ter with a strong revolutionary col
umn advancing on Campo Grande.
Matto Grosso is one of the large
inland states of Brazil, somewhat
removed from the jDrincipal theater
of fighting. Insurgent forces there
might aid in subjugation of loyal
Goyaz but would hardly be of much
use along the Sao Paulo-Parana
frontier where the major engage
ments of the war, it seems, will be
fought.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 21. </P> —
The Brazilian embassy in a state
ment today said insurgent activities
in Brazil have "sensibly decreased"
to the north and south of the divid
ing states, Parana and Sao Paulo,
since the attack on Itarare where it
said federal troops were successful.
The embassy statement, based on
dispatches received today, said the
bank holiday in Rio de Janeiro had
been extended until November 30,
but that national as well as foreign
banks would be allowed to transact
business with the exception of pur
chasing drafts of exportation, which
are exclusively centered in the
Banco do Brasil.
