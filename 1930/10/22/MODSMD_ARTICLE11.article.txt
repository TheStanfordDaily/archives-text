# ROOTERS ASKED TO LEARN SONGS
## "Trojan Horse," Stanford Hymn To Be Used 
### 
Cardinal rooters are requested by
George McKee, cheer leader, to
know all the Stanford football songs
which will be sung at the U.S.C.
game and at the game rally tonight.
Following are two important songs
to be used:
The Trojan Horse
In the days of long ago the mighty
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme,
But a simple wooden horse upset
their mighty boast,
And their glory became but a
dream.
Now the Trojans have a namesake
down at Southern Cal.,
And they're boastful as boastful
can be.
But they're going to meet their
match, because the Cardinal
Will play horse with U.S.C.
Ilail, Stanford, Hail!
Where the rolling foolhills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
REFRAIN
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
