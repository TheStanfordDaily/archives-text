"Europe is sitting on a volcano
and something is liable to pop up
at any minute," said Comptroller
A. E. Roth in a talk before the Palo
Alto Rotary Club Monday, after W.
B. Owens had shown moving pic
tures of the Stanford-Minnesota
football game, and Colonel Cubbi
son, new commander of the Stan
ford Reserve Officers Training
Corps, had been welcomed into the
organization.
