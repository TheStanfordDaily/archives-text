# MINE BLAST KILLS MANY IN GERMANY
## Fate Of 200 Men Unknown As Explosion Blocks Lower Passages 
### 
ALSDORF, Germany, Oct. 21. (/P)
—At least one hundred coal miners
and surface workers perished today
in a terrific explosion of a store of
dynamite in tha number 2 shaft of
the Anna coal mine.
The explosion ignited a gasoline
tank underneath the office building
of the Eschweiler Mining Company.
The fate of 200 men on a level
lower than where the explosion oc
curred was still uncertain late this
afternoon, but it was hoped to save
those trapped as the effect of the
blast was more severe upward than
in a downward direction.
Bodies recovered numbered 35 at
the time the statement was issued.
At that hour there were approxi
mately 60 dead underground and
76 injured in a hospital.
The deaths of four of these this
afternoon brought the total to 100.
The bodies of 30 miners were
quickly recovered from the shat
tered Wilhelm shaft but as the day
wore on and rescue workers dug in
the ruins additional bodies were
brought out. Four of those injured
and taken 1o hospitals died and by
late afternoon the death list had
reached 45.
Mine officials said part of the dif
ficulty in estimating the casualties
lay in the fact that many of the 666
miners who went down on the day
shift escaped safely but were so
1 Tightened they did not check out
with the company.
The 150 imprisoned men are at a
depths of 1,550 feet and ceaseless ef
forts are being made to reach them.
Damaged ventilation and pumping
machinery has been repaired to
facilitate the work.
When the blast occurred the first
thought of the countryside was of
an earthquake, with panic-stricken
country folk for miles around flee
ing into the open.
