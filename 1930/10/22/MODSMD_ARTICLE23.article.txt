# UNEMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS SEEN FIRST HAND BY COLLEGE WOMEN
## 
### 
Unemployment conditions and in
dustrial situations in San Francisco
were shown first hand to a group of
nine women students from colleges
along the Pacific Coast this summer
who enrolled in the student indus
try project.
Each came to San Francisco with
a cash reserve of $15 to carry her
on until she could get work, and
each was intent on getting a job in
a factory and living on her earnings
for a period of five weeks.
Forums under the direction of
Rex Bell, assistant in educational
research here, and Essie Maguiro,
Y.W.C.A. national secretary of in
dustry for the northwest region,
were held twice a week, and speak
ers consisting of labor heads or in
dustrial experts were obtained for
each discussion.
Before the girls came, a list of
174 factories which employed wo
men, with the address of each, was
prepared for help in seeking jobs.
From that list, c ue to six of the
girls had visited 89 of thorn and

several other places which were not
on the list. Seven out of the nine
had jobs at the end of the second
day, all obtained work after a long
and persistent search.
Because most of the factories were
running short-handed, if at all,
most of the girls were able to se
cure work only in the peak indus
tries: laundries ior a couple of days
when a ship was in or there was an
extra rush; green pea packing for
three days following Fourth of July
week-end; mayonnaise factory which
employs over twice as many in the
summer as the rest of the year;
canneries which run only in the
summer.
The groups were under the direc
tion of an advisory board, of which
Almon E. Roth, comptroller, was a
member, and of various student
councils. John Way, who was Stan
ford representative on the student
executive committee, was a member
of the Student In Industry project
a year ago when it was carried on
in Los Angeles.
