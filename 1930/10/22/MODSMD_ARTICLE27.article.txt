# PRACTICE HELD SECRETLY FOR U.S.C. CONTEST
## Herb And "Mush" Offer Only Feature of Quite Feeble Session WARNER NAMES PLAYS 
### 
With blanketed sophomore man
agers again keeping vigilant lookout
while the varsity practiced behind
the shelter of the green fence, last
night's football session went along
uneventfully. All the men, with the
exception of Henri Laborde, were
out in moleskins last night working
out.
Dummy scrimmage with the Gray
men occupied the Cards, with War
ner naming plays for the men and
calling them for their mistakes. The
illumination for the field was in
use again, as it no doubt will be all
this week, and the practice session
lasted about two hours.
Herb Fleishhacker and "Mush''
Muller were the features of an
otherwise dull practice. Before the
men arrived, Big Herb contributed
a dollar to the Warner pocketbook
in an impromptu game of pitch and
toss which ended when Pop was
ahead. Besides pestering Hulen,
Herb kept Laborde busy attempting
to watch practice and his own an
tics at one and the same time.
Muller proved that he had not
forgotten what a football looks like
by going up in the air to capture
Fleishhacker's left-handed tosses as
he used to when holding down an
end berth last year. The only time
Herb-to-Mush's attempt fell incom
plete was when a little chap named
Heinecke happened to get in the
way.
