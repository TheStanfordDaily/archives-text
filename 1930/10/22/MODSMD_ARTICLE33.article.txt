The serious injury of Professor and Mrs. William Durand at J
the intersection of J'aim Drive and the State Highway Monday, i
... â€¢
( ailed attention once again to the inadequate facilities now provided
lo regulate traffic at this dangerous crossing.
Arterial stop signs at the points where Palm Drive and Univer
sity avenue meet the Highway are the only controls now in use at j
ibis intersection to facilitate the passage of traffic. Traffic between j
.Palo Alto and the campus is far too great to be Satisfactorily!
handled by a pair of stop signs.
Yesterday's Campus Opinion column carried a letter complain
ing about the "racking up" of automobiles at the intersection of
Palm Drive and the Highway. The writer suggested that a system!
of traffic signals be installed at this intersection.
I'or several weeks the City of Palo Alto has had a committee
investigating the situation, and it is probable that a definite an
nouncement concerning traffic regulation at this crossing will be
made soon.
The intersection is without question a dangerous one. Professor i
Durand's accident was only one of many which have occurred there, j
\ complete system of effective controls is needed, and its installa-,
tion should be delayed 110 longer than is necessary for the adjust
ment of financial and legal details.
