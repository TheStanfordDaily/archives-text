# MAYONNAISE AND DIRTY SHIRTS
## 
### 
First hand experience in factories, laundries and canneries was [
the summer diversion this year among certain of the college women
of the Pacific Coast. Nine women students spent five weeks with
green peas, mayonnaise, and cookies, to investigate industrial con
ditions in San Francisco.
As a part of the "Student-Tn-Industry" project, these adven
turous young girls ran the entire gamut of factory-girl experience.
They walked the streets hunting for jobs: they got let out occasion-;
ally ; they associated with the "mob."
An interesting study, no doubt, with many startling revelations.
\ll of the observers reported a wide fear among employees of
losing their jobs. This apprehension, of course, prevented any ob
jections to violations of labor laws. Conditions, it would seem, are
in a bad way.
The "Student-In-Tndustry" project is prompted by a noble and
intelligent aim—that of acquainting the leaders of tomorrow with i
the actual conditions of factory labor. It is doubtful, however,
that their investigations of this summer will do anything towards
alleviating the present dismal economic distress.
The presence of these nine college women in the laundries and '
factories of San Francisco probably meant only that nine real fac-«'
lory girls were unemployed.
