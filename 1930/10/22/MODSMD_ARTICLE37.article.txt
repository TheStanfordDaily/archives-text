IJIKD OF THE FLAME. At Geary
Theatre, San Francisco.
"Aloma of the South Seas" re
i tilled, a bit vaguely, "Bird of the
Flame," opened last night at the
Geary. It is full of familiar Polyne
sian types: the leering sea captain
and the grinning hoochy-cooehy
girls; the nauseating flounder in a
Mother Hubbard who chases the
aforementioned pepsodent smiles
■ about the stage; the indignant maj
esty of the law; the inevitable ta-ta
Englishman; the pal who is, in
| reality, a bosomed snake. In short
i the play rests on its color (the pro
ducers have provided elaborate set
tings and costumes); its lovers,
Bramwell Fletcher when he is drunk
' and Robert Fraser in spite of the
fact that he makes love in pidgin
English and delivers heated sermons
on the wickedness of white influ
ence in the Islands; and Dorothy
Bu-rgess whose Lamanu is natural
and sincere.
The most delicious wit belongs to
the star who combines native nai
vete and more civilized sophistica
j tion in an original seduction. For
' other amusement one is feasted on
such riotous tidbits as: "I'm not all
white; my father was a Swede" or
"Drink is the curse of men in this
country; bring me a whiskey and
soda."
A. H. Van Buren's staging in
cluded the usual native gyrations
to alluring noises by whistles,
drums, and sweet-pea tenors.
Concluding: the play is a "star's
vehicle"; the star is most intriguing

if the vehicle is not. —J. S. S.

THE CRIMSON HOUR—At the
Curran Theatre, San Francisco.
"The Crimson Hour" lias reopened
I at the Columbia after a three weeks'
I engagement in Los Angeles.
Pauline Frederick will be seen as
Mary Bancroft for two weeks only,
i Belasco and Curran are taking her
i to Chicago in two weeks to star in
j the same vehicle.
In the play, Pauline Frederick, as
Mary Eancroft, a very successful
; woman attorney, saves her client at
the expense of her own reputation.
! A cabaret entertainer murders
her father. She refuses to divulge
the motive which circumstantial
evidence and deductive reasoning
I stamps as unmistakable incest. The
girl doesn't want to disillusion her
mother.
Absolute proof of a secret adop
tion clears the atmosphere for a
slightly disappointing finale. A bril
liant woman sacrifices her career for
■ the love of a hopelessly- uncouth
daughter.
The cast is ordinary, the
sets and direction by Gordon Davis,
formerly director of dramatics at
Stanford. Miss Frederick gives un
stinted praise to Davis for the suc
cess of the production and has ex
' pressed a desire to produce "Gran
i ite," last year's English Club play,
I under his direction.
The play as a whole is well worth
seeing, especially with Miss Fred
erick and Huntly Gordon in the
leading roles. —B. P.

THE CRIMSON HOUR—At the
Curran Theatre, San Francisco.
"The Crimson Hour" lias reopened
I at the Columbia after a three weeks'
I engagement in Los Angeles.
Pauline Frederick will be seen as
Mary Bancroft for two weeks only,
i Belasco and Curran are taking her
i to Chicago in two weeks to star in
j the same vehicle.
In the play, Pauline Frederick, as
Mary Eancroft, a very successful
; woman attorney, saves her client at
the expense of her own reputation.
! A cabaret entertainer murders
her father. She refuses to divulge
the motive which circumstantial
evidence and deductive reasoning
I stamps as unmistakable incest. The
girl doesn't want to disillusion her
mother.
Absolute proof of a secret adop
tion clears the atmosphere for a
slightly disappointing finale. A bril
liant woman sacrifices her career for
■ the love of a hopelessly- uncouth
daughter.
The cast is ordinary, the
sets and direction by Gordon Davis,
formerly director of dramatics at
Stanford. Miss Frederick gives un
stinted praise to Davis for the suc
cess of the production and has ex
' pressed a desire to produce "Gran
i ite," last year's English Club play,
I under his direction.
The play as a whole is well worth
seeing, especially with Miss Fred
erick and Huntly Gordon in the
leading roles. —B. P.
IJIKD OF THE FLAME. At Geary
Theatre, San Francisco.
"Aloma of the South Seas" re
i tilled, a bit vaguely, "Bird of the
Flame," opened last night at the
Geary. It is full of familiar Polyne
sian types: the leering sea captain
and the grinning hoochy-cooehy
girls; the nauseating flounder in a
Mother Hubbard who chases the
aforementioned pepsodent smiles
■ about the stage; the indignant maj
esty of the law; the inevitable ta-ta
Englishman; the pal who is, in
| reality, a bosomed snake. In short
i the play rests on its color (the pro
ducers have provided elaborate set
tings and costumes); its lovers,
Bramwell Fletcher when he is drunk
' and Robert Fraser in spite of the
fact that he makes love in pidgin
English and delivers heated sermons
on the wickedness of white influ
ence in the Islands; and Dorothy
Bu-rgess whose Lamanu is natural
and sincere.
The most delicious wit belongs to
the star who combines native nai
vete and more civilized sophistica
j tion in an original seduction. For
' other amusement one is feasted on
such riotous tidbits as: "I'm not all
