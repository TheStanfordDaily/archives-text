You can tell a Law student

We are sorriest for the frosh and
the English majors. ... For the
youngsters, because they haven't
yet learned of the social prestige
obtained by being ten minutes late

or else he h.is a line. Love, after

No one can safely tell what a
line may develop into.
Loafing on the Quad itself is
' wasted effort, anyway. Personally,
we adorn the Library steps, when

who still appreciate the fact that
