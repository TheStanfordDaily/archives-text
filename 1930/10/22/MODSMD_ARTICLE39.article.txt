The president of Temple Univer
sity asks his students to develop ;
personality. Some Stanfordites have
already followed this suggestion.
We imagine we should include i
among those who have developed
personality the frosh who told the
sophs to go somewhere in red let- I
ters on the cement slap in front of (
the "law steps." In the same cate- |
gory is the fellow who drove his j
Ford roadster down the cement ;
walk leading to the library.
And of course we mustn't forget i
that those Fair Young Things who \
get SO excited at a football game
that they jump up and down on
their toes, pretend to bite their nails, ;
roll their brown felt hats into a i
little roll, shout in VERY excited
falsettos, and cling to the escort's
arm, have also developed their per- j
sonality.
There is no getting around it that j
in some respects Easterners are
more refined than their western
cousins. At the University of Illinois,
they call liquor dispensaries "Thirst j
Parlors," which we must all admit i
sounds much nicer than "Speak- j
easies."
I
Freshmen at U.S.C. must bow to
a bronze "Trojan" beneath which
are inscribed the words, "Ambition
—Scholarship—Courage—Loyalty."
We fail to see why the terms,
"Punting, Passing, Publicity, and
Interference" are not added to the
list of ideals for young Trojanites.
Universities in the metropolitan
centers are trying to consolidate
their educational plants; and here
at Stanford we could also do some
centralizing.
Most Sunday visitors, to Stanford
want to sec Hoover's Home and the
Memorial Church. We bet that if the
President's home was moved into
the Inner Quad, it would take two i
companies of mounted police to beat
away the crowds.
