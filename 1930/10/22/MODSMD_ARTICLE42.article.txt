SUICIDES AND INK
The Editor, Sir:
In today's Daily a news item
stated that William Kogut, convict
ed murderer, attempted suicide. Ac- !
cording to The San Francisco Call-
Bulletin, I understood that Kogut's
attempt was quite successful. In
fact, if you read the gory details, I
don't think you would have had the
nerve to call it an attempt. In his
own way, Kogut was quite an
artist.
I'd also like to inquire why the
University has suddenly become so
very parsimonious. I'm talking
about the ink-room in the library
now. After all, that place has been
an eye-sore for years. Why get all
worked up about it now and close
it without warning? I really think
the University is trying to inveigle
us into buying our own ink. For, j
alter all, it requires quite a bit of t

nerve to go into the Reserve Book
Room every morning or afternoon
and fill one's pen under the eagle
eyes of the library minions. Why
don't the authorities economize on
something elseâ€”and let us have our
ink?
Sincerely, '31.
