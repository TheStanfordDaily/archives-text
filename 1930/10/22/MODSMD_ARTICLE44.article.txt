TWO MOTIONS
When in the course of college
events, it becomes necessary for the
student body by and large to sit in
rooting sections and hold colored
cards beneath their noses for the
entertainment of the masses parked
across the stadium,* one of the most
inking annoyances of the task is the
I act that this same student body
holding up the cards is totally un
able to see the effect they produce.
Last year, it was the kind-hearted
custom of Yell-leader Paul Speegle
l<> go into ecstacieK at the height of
the stunt, and then to announce it
was a block S or something equally
complicated. That was a big help,
but it still left the rooters dissatis
fied.
Now over at California, for ex
ample, it is the habit of the officials
to plot the rooting section stunts
upon a large bit of cardboard in
appropriate colors, and to hold vin
this sketch before the anxious eyes
of the students at the same time the
stunt is produced by the section.
Thus the curious can see just
what is going on, and a feeling of
mutual satisfaction is created in the
rooting section. It is a simple enough
matter, hut one which merits dupli
cation at the Farm. After all, the
men who hold the cards ought to
know what the result is.
One of the most perverse features
of the human race fies in the fact
that they want to know what they
are doing. While an oral description
of a visual phenomenon means
something, the Stanford stunts beg
gar description and must be illus
trated to be appreciated.
Taking a dive into the dim and
distant past, we pull the following
from our scrap hook. It seems that
in 1928. at the Big Game, students
were given neat red megaphones
once they were seated in the stands.
A precedent was set. but it has not
been followed.
Now megaphones, besides in
creasing the volume of sound which
the students are able to produce,
direct this sound point-blank at the
opposite rooting section. Thunder
ous roars emanating from the
Cardinal crew drowned all of Cali
fornia's feeble catcalls that year,
r.nd made it almost impossible for
ihe Blue and Gold cohorts £o hear
even their own voices.
Saturday a section of Trojans
larger than that of the Cardinals
will he seated across the way. It
will he the duty of every loyal
Itedshirt to. do all he can to deafen
those invaders, and he will be forced
to make up in violence what is lack
ing in numbers.
Stanford will need megaphones on
the 25th. Those Trojans are just
about the cockiest people on earth
anyway, and with two victories to
their credit already, they think they
will mop up the field with the
Thundering Herd of Jones's. Stan
ford must emerge with the noisiest
rooting section as well as the win
ning team on that momentous oc
casion.
If there is a Santa Claus, or if
some ambitious advertiser will uti
lize megaphones to put his name
before the eyes of the Cardinals,
havoc' will be wrought upon the
hosts of Troy, and the triumphant
Kcdshirts will carry all before them.
If not . . . well, it will he a hoarse
Stanford Saturday night.
