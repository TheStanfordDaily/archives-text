# "TICK-TOCK" TICKNOR
## Harvard Man Wins All-American Center in Spite of Heavy Competition From West 
### Feg Murray, '16 
To be chosen Ail-America center
in 1929 meant something, with play- j
ers around like Mownihan of Notre
Dame, Heinecke of Stanford, Siano
of Fordham, Reigels of California,
and Havens of Western Maryland
all in line for the honor. But "Big
Ben" Ticknor of Harvard got the j
job and his work during the season
undoubtedly justified his selection. ;
Ticknor was a spectacular player,
and he made the most of Harvard's
scheme of defense, which employed
him loose behind a six-man line,
where he roamed around getting 1
into the thick of every play and,
most likely as not, making the
tackle.
And what tackles they were, too!
The kind you hear as well as see,
teeth-jarring, spine-tingling tackles,
in which Ticknor would nearly drive
his victims into the ground as
though he meant to bury them ;
where they fell. A nice, gentle play- j

mate is this blue-blooded aristocrat
from Harvard! "The hardest tackier
to evade I ever encountered," said
the great A 1 Marsters of Dartmouth,
and it was not until Ticknor was
taken out of the game with an ab
dominal bruise that the Green
"Will-o'-the-wisp" ran amuck
around and through Harvard's line.
Albie Booth couldn't get by Tick
nor, and it was Big Ben, too, who
intercepted a Cagle pass and scored
a touchdown in the Army game
last year.
Now this tough hombre is cap
tain of the Harvard team, and take
it from me that Dartmouth, Michi
gan, and Yale are in for a hectic
afternoon when they meet up with
him again. He's smart as well as
ferocious, stands 6 feet 2 and
weighs 193 pounds, and his hands
get around even better than those
of the famous Big Ben in London!

"Tick-Tock" Ticknor makes his op
ponents call "Time!"

To be chosen Ail-America center
in 1929 meant something, with play- j
ers around like Mownihan of Notre
Dame, Heinecke of Stanford, Siano
of Fordham, Reigels of California,
and Havens of Western Maryland
all in line for the honor. But "Big
Ben" Ticknor of Harvard got the j
job and his work during the season
undoubtedly justified his selection. ;
Ticknor was a spectacular player,
and he made the most of Harvard's
scheme of defense, which employed
him loose behind a six-man line,
where he roamed around getting 1
into the thick of every play and,
most likely as not, making the
tackle.
And what tackles they were, too!
The kind you hear as well as see,
teeth-jarring, spine-tingling tackles,
in which Ticknor would nearly drive
his victims into the ground as
though he meant to bury them ;
where they fell. A nice, gentle play- j

mate is this blue-blooded aristocrat
from Harvard! "The hardest tackier
to evade I ever encountered," said
the great A 1 Marsters of Dartmouth,
and it was not until Ticknor was
taken out of the game with an ab
dominal bruise that the Green
"Will-o'-the-wisp" ran amuck
around and through Harvard's line.
Albie Booth couldn't get by Tick
nor, and it was Big Ben, too, who
intercepted a Cagle pass and scored
a touchdown in the Army game
last year.
Now this tough hombre is cap
tain of the Harvard team, and take
it from me that Dartmouth, Michi
gan, and Yale are in for a hectic
afternoon when they meet up with
him again. He's smart as well as
ferocious, stands 6 feet 2 and
weighs 193 pounds, and his hands
get around even better than those
of the famous Big Ben in London!
