# CHAPARRAL SALES SURPASS HIGHEST PREVIOUS RECORD
## 
### 
Equalling the top record of last
year, Chaparral sales yesterday re
sulted in a complete sell-out of the
first magazine of the school year,
according to Ray Winther, circula
tion manager.
Bernice Woodard, selling on the
Quad, made the largest individual
sales record yesterday, with Marie
Baker in second place, Winther re
ported.
The magazine, first under the edi
torship of Burnell Gould, drew
much comment from San Francisco
newspapers as well as on the cam
pus. The Call-Bulletin, Examiner,
and News of San Francisco gave
news space to the critical and hu
morous features of the issue.
