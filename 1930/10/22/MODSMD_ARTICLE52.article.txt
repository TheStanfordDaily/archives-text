# STUDY, ROOTERS PROVE TOO MUCH FOR YELL LEADER
## 
### 
The strain of keeping up with ex
ceedingly heavy assignments given
by professors and trying to get an
over-sophisticated rooting section
pepped up was given as the cause of
nervous breakdown by David Rob
erts, Occidental yell leader, after the
Occidental-Whittier night football
game in the Pasadena Rose Bowl
1 last week.
I After the game Roberts escorted
i a woman student to her home and
i suddenly crumpled to the floor, un
j conscious. He was rushed to his fra
| ternity house, from which he was
taken by ambulance to a receiving
j hospital. He returned to school the
j following Monday.
