# YEARLINGS MAKE READY FOR MATCH WITH ST. MARY'S
## Injuries Hamper Frosh As Conflict With Gaels Draws Near 
### 
Somewhat hampered by several
, injuries sustained by his men in the
|U.C.L.A. tilt last week, Jimmy Brad
shaw's yearling grid men are gath
ering themselves together for Sat
| urday's tussle with the aggregation
i of ex-prep school stars who repre
! sent the Saint Mary's freshmen,
j The more serious injuries to the
| babe squad may keep Anderson,
| first string fullback, Edelen, at end,
I and Tarver, first string guard, out
| of the Gael tilt.
In this event, the yearling mentor
j has Miller for the wing position and
Lipscomb for the berth at full, both
I of these men having shown well in
alternating thus far this season.
Though Lipscomb came to the Farm
! wifh little previous grid experience,
; he held down the fullback position
|in several early season games in
place of Anderson, who was on the
| bench with a bad leg.
! For the end berth, Bradshaw has
\ Miller, who was a teammate of the
; other regular wing man, Monsalve,
' at Lowell High last year. Miller saw
some action against the Bruins last
week, and his presence in the lineup
i would not hamper the Cards' effec
' tiveness.
The calibre of the Saint Mary's
I talent is very apparent in the past
| prep school records of their year
! lings. Among them is a pair of all
| San Francisco ends, together with
some star backfield material from
city high-school ranks.
A big threat for the Moraga babes
is Jack Baat, captain of the cham
pionship Mission High eleven last
year, who has shown spectacular
ability in leading his teammates
i through an undefeated season so
1 far.
