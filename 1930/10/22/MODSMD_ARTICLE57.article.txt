ably have an especially hard-fought

will be held on the varsity courts
at 3:30 o'clock.
The contestants will be the first
six men of the varsity squad. The
matches will be as follows: Gled
hill vs. Easton, Plymire vs. Cough
lin, Stephens vs. Weisner, Gledhill
and Coughlin vs. Easton and Ply
mire, and Weisner and Stephens vs.
Cox and Niederaur.
According to Frank Ragan, var
sity coach, the match between Keith
Gledhill, former national junior
champion and bright prospect for
1 his year's Davis Cup team, and
Captain Ted Easton, number one
man of last year's team, should be
exceedingly interesting. "This
match," Coach Ragan says, "will
give us a line on this year's number
one man."
Concerning Plymire and Cough
lin, the coach said: "They will prob
ably have an especially hard-fought

| match, as they were fourth and
fifth in the national junior rankings
two years ago. At that time they
j played some tough matches against
1 each other in the East. In one match
on an especially hot day, Coughlin
I had to be carried from the courts
| at the finish."
According to Ragan the doubles
i matches will all be closely con
i tested, as the men are quite evenly
[ matched.
Next week Coach Ragan plans to
have some outside players come
down for exhibition matches. Cran
i ston HoLmap and Phil Neer, both
i former Stanford tennis team cap
-1 tains, are tentatively lined up. The
other outside players are undeter
mined as yet.
It is Ragan's plan to have ex
hibition matches regularly every
Thursday if he can possibly arrange
them. This will be a continuance of
his last year's policy, which gives
tennis fans an opportunity to see
the tennis stars of this vicinity in
action.
