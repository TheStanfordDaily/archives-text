# FROSH SOCCER MEN TO MEET SAN JOSE STATE TEAM TODAY
## 
### 
Accustoming themselves to var
sity competition, the freshman soc
cer men took on the first string of
Harry Maloney's varsity yesterday
afternoon in a practice scrimmage.
The yearlings made a very en
couraging showing against the
older men, and look like an even
bet to take the San Jose State var
sity which will come up to meet
them this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
Ward Smith's hopefuls made a
goal before the varsity could score
and then played an almost even
game with their opponents through
out the scrimmage, although trail
ing 2-1 at the end.
Having dropped a 1-0 decision to
the California freshmen last week,
the San Jose men do not loom as
an overwhelming aggregation. How
ever, the Card frosh have met noth
ing but high-school teams, and their
ability in stiff competition is yet to
be demonstrated.
