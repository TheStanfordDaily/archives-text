# FIVE NEW TRAINING PLANES ARRIVE AT PALO ALTO SCHOOL
## 
### 
With the arrival of five new
Fleet training planes from the Con
solidated Air Craft Co., Buffalo,
New York, the introduction of a
four-volume ground school course
prepared by U.S. Army experts, and
an innovation in flight schools, the
travelling school, the Palo Alto
School of Aviation again presents
the unusual opportunity to Stanford
students, of securing both a pilot's
license in aviation, and an A.B. de
gree on the same campus.
The Palo Alto airport is now the
operating company of the Associ
ated Air Services Ltd., Paul Mantz,
chief pilot, and holder of the world
record for outside loops, being the
ilight instructor. Tom Penfield is in
charge of the ground school, and
Frank Moore conducts the travelling
school, flying a plane from Palo Alto
to Ukiah, Santa Rosa, Sonoma, and
Fort Bragg, and giving instruction
in each town.
The course of training patterns
that used by the U.S. Army in cadet
training. As a course for Stanford
students, it follows the quarter sys
tem. It is impossible to complete
pilot training in one quarter. Twen
ty-five hours are required in the
air including ten solo. In addition,
lectures supplementing the text are
held at night.
A policy of the Palo Alto airport
is to use new planes only in their
courses of instruction. After a plane
has been flown 400 hours it is com
pletely overhauled and sold.
The airport mechanics have their
own well-equipped workshops in
the hangars. One mechanic, Art
"Shorty" Millet", has built his own
plane there. It is now ready for
its first flight, when its flying ability
will be tested by Paul Mantz.
Fred Burley, Stanford student,
owns a ship that might be called
the "ship with a famous motor," or
the "motor that should have seen
the South Pole." The ship's motor
is one of a tri-motored plane which
was to have gone with Byrd, but
which cracked up before the expe
dition sailed.
As an alliance to the University,
on whose campus the airport is lo
cated, the company's flagship is a
large plane, colored cardinal with a
bit of white trimming.
