# AIDA MARCH TO BE PLAYED BY ALLEN IN ORGAN RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will play the celebrated
march from Verdi's opera "Aida"
in the regular Thursday afternoon
organ recital to be given tomorrow
in the Memorial Church at 4:15
o'clock.
"Aida" has often been called '"the
perfect opera" and the march to be
played by Allen is perhaps the most
familiar of its many well-known se
lections. It is played in the opera
at the return of Rhadanies, the
Egyptian general, from the conquest
of Ethiopia, and is unique in that
the melody is played by brasses on
the stage itself rather than in the
orchestra.
The program to be played Tues
day afternoon is as follows:
Choral in E Major Joseph Jongen
(Modern Belgian)
Scherzetto Louis Vierne
From "24 Pieces in. Free Style"
(Modern French)
Deep Riverâ€”Negro Spiritual
"Deep River, my home is over
yonder,
Deep River, I want to cross over
into Jordan."
Trois Pieces Breves
Maurice Lenormand
March from "Aida"
Giuseppe Verdi
