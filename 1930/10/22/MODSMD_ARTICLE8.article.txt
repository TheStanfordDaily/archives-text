# MEARS SPEAKS ON FOREIGN TRIP
## He States Universities Are Same World Over 
### 
"My general impression of foreign
universities after a year and a half
spent abroad is that all university
people seem to think and act start
lingly alike irrespective of race, re
ligion, or government," stated Pro
fessor Eliot G. Mears, Professor of
International Relations in the Grad
uate School of Business, in a lec
ture in the Little Theatre last night,
Professor Mears has just returned
from an eighteen months' trip as
Carnegie exchange professor of in
ternational relations.
"Whatever differences there may
be between our university system
and that of Europe is due to two
causes," Professor Mears said.
"These are: environment with its
modifying mold of greater age and
tradition; and the influence of poli
tics upon the appointment of pro
fessors, the tenure of their posi
tions, and the contents of their
courses.
"During the course of my trip I
visited twenty-four universities, and
had an opportunity to observe fully
half of them very well. They were
located in nine different countries
of widely differing governments and
religions, though I was particularly
interested in the Near East, France,
Switzerland, Austria, and Scotland.
"I found a very commendable
spirit of friendliness between pro
fessors and students. In all Euro
pean universities professors lecture,
however, on only one phase of a
subject and students must work
hard to gain information. They are
extremely nationalistic and cannot
deal with problems touching their
own countries with the frankness
and lack of bias to be found in
America, On the other hand, there
is a thirst for knowledge not to be
found in Amcrica.
"The wide reputation that I found
Stanford to enjoy abroad is due
mainly to the men on the faculty
here and to the work done in the
Institute of Pacific Relations.
