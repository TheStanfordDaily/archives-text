# NEW CHAIRMAN IS TO DIRECT LABOR FUTURE
## Government Committee Is To Take Immediate Steps For Relief ORGANIZATIONS READY 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. (/P)—'The
renewed efforts of the government
to aid the nation's unemployed took
more definite form tonight as Presi
dent Hoover and the man,he has
named to direct the activities —
Colonel Arthur Woods of New York
t —conferred at the White House.
Colonel Woods arrived late in the
day and went directly to the execu
tive 'mansion where the President
awaited him in his office. Later he
called upon Secretary Lamont at
the la It er's home.
Describing the situation as a
"race against human misery," the
new administrator said the govern
ment "must and will win."
He asserted that the problem
would be met with all the informa
tion and vigor that can be sum
moned and that he and the Presi
dent's Cabinet Committee of seven
would try to take immediately the
steps needed to meet the situation.
Woods Accepts Post
He had accepted the post, In
which he will serve without pay,
only yesterday, and declined to dis
cuss particulars of the organization
to be set up until he confers with
associations tomorrow.
An organization similar to that
which he directed in 1921 at the in
stance of President Harding is to
bo established, Colonel Woods in
dicated, with changes to meet new
conditions.
He said most of the work of the
government probably would lie in
the co-ordination of local activities,
and that the plans would be adapted
to the varying needs of different
sections of the country. The organi
zations already set up throughout
the country had made the task
easier, he said.
While the Cabinet Committee
awaited the coming of Colonel
Woods to press the relief operations,
Secretary Davis at the Labor De
partment greeted a group gathering
to assist in the satistical study of
employment and economic matters
which the government conducts.
He warned them that they would
be asked to lay down some method
of determining to what degree the
displacing of human labor by ad
vanced machine designs or im
proved processes had contributed to
unemployment.
Only a detailed study as com
pared with an enumeration would
furnish a sufficiently good picture
of this contribution to the total of
the jobless, it was suggested, and
help* was asked in the application
of methods to aid the government
in gathering data.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. (/P)—'The
renewed efforts of the government
to aid the nation's unemployed took
more definite form tonight as Presi
dent Hoover and the man,he has
named to direct the activities —
Colonel Arthur Woods of New York
t —conferred at the White House.
Colonel Woods arrived late in the
day and went directly to the execu
tive 'mansion where the President
awaited him in his office. Later he
called upon Secretary Lamont at
the la It er's home.
Describing the situation as a
"race against human misery," the
new administrator said the govern
ment "must and will win."
He asserted that the problem
would be met with all the informa
tion and vigor that can be sum
moned and that he and the Presi
dent's Cabinet Committee of seven
would try to take immediately the
steps needed to meet the situation.
Woods Accepts Post
He had accepted the post, In
which he will serve without pay,
only yesterday, and declined to dis
cuss particulars of the organization
to be set up until he confers with
associations tomorrow.
An organization similar to that
which he directed in 1921 at the in
stance of President Harding is to
bo established, Colonel Woods in
dicated, with changes to meet new
conditions.
He said most of the work of the
government probably would lie in
the co-ordination of local activities,
and that the plans would be adapted
to the varying needs of different
sections of the country. The organi
zations already set up throughout
the country had made the task
easier, he said.
While the Cabinet Committee
awaited the coming of Colonel
Woods to press the relief operations,
Secretary Davis at the Labor De
partment greeted a group gathering
to assist in the satistical study of
employment and economic matters
which the government conducts.
He warned them that they would
be asked to lay down some method
of determining to what degree the
displacing of human labor by ad
vanced machine designs or im
proved processes had contributed to
unemployment.
