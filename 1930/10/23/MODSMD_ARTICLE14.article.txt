# POOR OLD JERSEY TO KICK NO MORE
## 
### 
FORT HANCOCK, N.J., Oct.
22 (/P) â€”Jersey lightning (which
is distilled cider), a white mule
(which is just as legal), and
mules all have kicks. But Jer
sey lightning, the army's mule,
kicks no more. She kicked and
otherwise objected so strenu
ously while being trussed to be
shod, that she broke her neck.
