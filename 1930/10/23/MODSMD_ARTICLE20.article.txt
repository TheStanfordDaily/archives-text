Called on Youth
i"The United States is not a na
tion of ancestors, but of descend
ants," said Dr. Sproul, in calling on
the youth of the day to walk with
him on broader paths of learning
and service.
"In the westward march of civili
zation, the ultra-conservatives have
stayed behind," he continued. "This
is a young country of faraway skies,
high, distant mountains, and deep,
fruitful valleys.
For the youth, President Sproul
: made a plea, not from more col
leges or universities, but for in
stitutions better fitted to meet th 3
needs of coming generations.
J.C. Work Approved
He placed his stamp of approval
on "real" junior colleges, not
i planned to encroach on the aims of
the four-year curriculums, but de
; signed to afford higher education to
those young people not planning to
enter the professions.
"This state and this university
have before them a magnificent
task," he added. Our minds are mo
bile, the products of the restless
ness and longing for change of the
Forty-niners. With clearer vision
we should stand guard and point
the way for business of higher
standards, for even-handed justice,
for the life more abundant. In that
great work it is the university's op
portunity to guide, direct and to
lead.
"No responsibility could be more
serious, no opportunity more chal
lenging."

Called on Youth
i"The United States is not a na
tion of ancestors, but of descend
ants," said Dr. Sproul, in calling on
the youth of the day to walk with
him on broader paths of learning
and service.
"In the westward march of civili
zation, the ultra-conservatives have
stayed behind," he continued. "This
is a young country of faraway skies,
high, distant mountains, and deep,
fruitful valleys.
For the youth, President Sproul
: made a plea, not from more col
leges or universities, but for in
stitutions better fitted to meet th 3
needs of coming generations.
J.C. Work Approved
He placed his stamp of approval
on "real" junior colleges, not
i planned to encroach on the aims of
the four-year curriculums, but de
; signed to afford higher education to
those young people not planning to
enter the professions.
"This state and this university
have before them a magnificent
task," he added. Our minds are mo
bile, the products of the restless
ness and longing for change of the
Forty-niners. With clearer vision
we should stand guard and point
the way for business of higher
standards, for even-handed justice,
for the life more abundant. In that
great work it is the university's op
portunity to guide, direct and to
lead.
