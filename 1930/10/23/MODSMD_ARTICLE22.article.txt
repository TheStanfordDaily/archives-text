# WARNER VOICES FAITH IN TEAM AT S.C. RALLY
## Says Cards Are Dumb Only In Experience; Wilson, Templeton Speak 
### 
'"Stanford's team in the game
Saturday will be more intelligent
than any eleven that ever repre
sented U.S.C." declared Coach Pop
Warner at the Cardinal football
rally in the Pavilion last night. "I
was quoted in the press the other
day as stating that the 1930 Stan
ford team is the dumbest team I
ever coached. That remark was not
intended for publication, • and 1
would qualify it by saying that it is
the dumbest in experience only.
"The ragged play the team has
showed in the games so far this
season has been due to the new
formation we are using. The boys
have been getting the system better
with every game," Warner con
tinued, "and they are getting their
individual duties in the plays per
fected gradually.
"I am sure the varsity team will
click better agnxnst Southern Cali
fornia than it has so far this season.
Stanford hasn't shown nearly all its
power yet, but I am certain that on
Saturday it will look like a real
football team," he concluded.
"Dink" Confident
"Dink" Templeton, track and field
cocah, made a short talk. "Stanford
stands right now on the threshhold
of what may be, and what 1 believe
to be her greatest football year. I
have often been accused of being
an optimist, but I do not feel that
I am being optimistic in legard to
this team. I have all the confidence
in the world in Pop Warner, his
system, and the Stanford team."
"Down at U.S.C. Stanford is
thought of as the school for snobs,"
said Philip Wilson, president of the
alumni group in the southern part
of the state. "That is the propaganda
they spread among the prep schools
of that region, that Stanford is a
spiritless institution. I and other
loyal alumni down there, however,
haven't lost faith. I know the team
is going to play hard and win in
Saturday's game."
New Yells Practiced
An original skit by Joe Thompson,
burlesquing the Trojan band, was
presented by a small group of men
on the program. Cheer-leaders Mc-
Kee, Weyl, and Harris introduced
new Six, Railroad, and Long yells,
to be used in the rooting section
Saturday. Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, introduced the speakers.
With the assistance of a portion
of the Stanford band, several songs
were led by the Cardinal quartet.
The quartet also sang the new
"Axe Song," which was submitted to
the Rally Committee Tuesday. The
rally closed with the singing of the
Hymn.
Following the rally, music was
furnished by an eight-piece band
for an all-University jolly-up, which
lasted for one hour.

to be her greatest football year. I
have often been accused of being
an optimist, but I do not feel that
I am being optimistic in legard to
this team. I have all the confidence
in the world in Pop Warner, his
system, and the Stanford team."
"Down at U.S.C. Stanford is
thought of as the school for snobs,"
said Philip Wilson, president of the
alumni group in the southern part
of the state. "That is the propaganda
they spread among the prep schools
of that region, that Stanford is a
spiritless institution. I and other
loyal alumni down there, however,
haven't lost faith. I know the team
is going to play hard and win in
Saturday's game."
New Yells Practiced
An original skit by Joe Thompson,
burlesquing the Trojan band, was
presented by a small group of men
on the program. Cheer-leaders Mc-
Kee, Weyl, and Harris introduced
new Six, Railroad, and Long yells,
to be used in the rooting section
Saturday. Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, introduced the speakers.
With the assistance of a portion
of the Stanford band, several songs
were led by the Cardinal quartet.
The quartet also sang the new
"Axe Song," which was submitted to
the Rally Committee Tuesday. The
rally closed with the singing of the
Hymn.
Following the rally, music was
furnished by an eight-piece band
for an all-University jolly-up, which
lasted for one hour.
'"Stanford's team in the game
Saturday will be more intelligent
than any eleven that ever repre
sented U.S.C." declared Coach Pop
Warner at the Cardinal football
rally in the Pavilion last night. "I
was quoted in the press the other
day as stating that the 1930 Stan
ford team is the dumbest team I
ever coached. That remark was not
intended for publication, • and 1
would qualify it by saying that it is
the dumbest in experience only.
"The ragged play the team has
showed in the games so far this
season has been due to the new
formation we are using. The boys
have been getting the system better
with every game," Warner con
tinued, "and they are getting their
individual duties in the plays per
fected gradually.
"I am sure the varsity team will
click better agnxnst Southern Cali
fornia than it has so far this season.
Stanford hasn't shown nearly all its
power yet, but I am certain that on
Saturday it will look like a real
football team," he concluded.
"Dink" Confident
"Dink" Templeton, track and field
cocah, made a short talk. "Stanford
stands right now on the threshhold
of what may be, and what 1 believe
to be her greatest football year. I
have often been accused of being
an optimist, but I do not feel that
I am being optimistic in legard to
this team. I have all the confidence
