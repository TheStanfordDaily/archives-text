# LIBRARY SECURES RARE VOLUME ON SAGAS OF ANCIENT ICELAND
## 
### 
The first of a series of three vol
umes of facsimile reproductions of
ancient literary treasures of Iceland
has been secured for the library. It
is to be placed on exhibition soon
and put at the disposal of anyone
interested. The series, entitled
"Corpus Codicum Islandicorum
Medii Aevi," is being published by
Levin and Munksgaard in Copen
hagen, * Denmark. "Flateyjarbok"
owes its importance to the fact that
it has preserved written copies of
excellent earlier writings. The ori
ginals came into existence in 1837-
94 and have been kept in the li
braries of Scandinavia. The volume
now in the library is a direct fac
simile of these. It contains not only
sagas of ancient Norwegian kings

but lays of other kings and an ac
count of the remarkable history of
the old Iceland colony in Greenland.
It is invaluable for knowledge of
i Norse culture and of the earliest
, voyages to Greenland and America,
j Volume 2, "The Younger Edda,"
i will contain a reproduction of the
| famous Codex Wormianus from the
Arnamagnaean Collection in the
i University Library at Copenhagen.
S The Codex Regius of, the famous
code of laws of Iceland will be in
cluded in Volume 3.
Albert M. Bender of San Fran
cisco has made possible the pur
chase of this series by his donation
, of the Typographical Fund for the
purpose of securing for the Stan
j ford Library printed books of note
I which have been published abroad.
