### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. (/I 3 )
â€”From all the odd corners of
the earth, frogs, lizards, turtles,
alligators, and snakes are as
sembling here for the Decem
ber .opening of the new reptile
exhibition house of the Nation
al Zoological Park.
Every day brings its curious
gift animals to Dr. William
Mann, superintendent. He
stows them away in basements
and furnace rooms, in attic cor
ners and office windows to
await the day when they can
preen themselves in decorative
glass cubicles before admiring
crowds.
