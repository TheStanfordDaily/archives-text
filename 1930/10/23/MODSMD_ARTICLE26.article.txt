### Ann Adams 
Work on the dignified and taste
ful set lo be used in all three acts
of "Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh," to be
given in the Assembly Hall tomor
row night, is nearing completion to
day, according to Frederick Stover,
technical director.
The single scene is the living room
of the Rawson home on Long Island.
The Rawsons are a family of wealth
and distinction, and the room is
representative of their social posi
tion. It has a quiet elegance, but to
further the atmosphere of comedy
care has been taken to increase the
sense of austerity.
When the class in theatre work
shop, which is preparing the set,
found confronting them the diffi
culty of finding a collection of Old
Masters suitable for the Rawson
home, it was decided to create them.
The work was accomplished by
drawing charcoal sketches on bur
lap and coloring with oil paints.
The use of the same set through
out the entire comedy has made it
possible to build up a set of great
solidity. Gray and rose are the pre
dominating colors of the living
room, and one can see the Long
Island countryside through the
French doors.
The action of the play takes place
in the morning of a bright summer
day, and in that short time situa
tions arise which carry the action
through high comedy to a hilarious
finish.
