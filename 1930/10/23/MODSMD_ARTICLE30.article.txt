# TEAM LEAVES CAMPUS AFTER LAST WORKOUT
## No Line-Up Announced Yet By Warner; Men All In Good Condition CARDS REST AT FARM 
### Len Kallmann 
Leaving for the Family farm to
night after practicc, the Stanford
varsity wilT take its last workout
prior to the U.S.C. game today. Se
cret practice was again in order
yesterday, and Warner put the men
through a long drill and scrimmage
with the Goofs. All of the squad
with the exception of Laborde are
expected to be in shape for the
game Saturday.
Warner announced no starting
lineup last night, but is expected
to release his list tonight. Indica
tions are that Pop will put his
strongest team on the field when
the whistle blows, and the eleven
will probably be composed of Neill
and Doub, ends; Bogue and Ehr
horn, tackles; Hand and Dawson,
guards; Taylor, center; Hillman,
quarterback; Moffatt and Caglieri,
halves; and Rothert, full.
Tandy May Not Start
Captain Ray Tandy is in shape to
play, although he may possibly be
saved to go into the game at a
psychological moment. Bardin and
Caglieri, formerly charter members
of the Cardinal cripplc club, have
been cavorting about the practice
field in fine shape, and mean a bad
time for Troy Saturday.
The return of Caglieri to the
lineup increases the strength of the
right half position. Although Caddel
impressed Saturday against Oregon
State, his greenness on defense may
prove to be a handicap. Bill Clark
is a proved pass defender, and Lit
tle William may get the call over
Cadell on Saturday if replacement
for Caglieri is needed.
Hillman W 'ears Mask
Harry Hillman, stellar Stanford
line-plunger, although forced to
wear a mask during practicc ses
sions, has lost none of his effective
ness. Hillman's work in. backing up
the line could not be replaced, and
his presence in the Card lineup will
mean trouble for the Trojan power
plays. Harry is something of a
power plant himself, and before the
game is over "Sweet" Musick may
be on key.
Most encouraging in the secret
drill is the grim business-like air
which surrounds the practice. Ex
cept for a few moments of levity,
Ihe men have been concentrating
on the plays, and the results of this
effort will be shown on the twenty
fifth.
