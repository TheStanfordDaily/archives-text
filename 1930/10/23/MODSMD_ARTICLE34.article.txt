# SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
## 
### 
Interclass athletic competition at Stanford has become a joke.
Reports from the touch football league tell us that the Class of I ( M2
was the only group t<> put a team on the field last week when two
games were scheduled. C lass presidents are now frantically striving
to revive the lagging interest of their cohorts lest the sports be
dropped for good.
Let em die. During the past year and a halt defaults have con
sistently marred the play. In several sports more forfeitures were
recorded than played contests. There is no need of reviving the
body when the soul has already gone peacefully on. Intramural
competition with its direct, personal appeal, has now captured stu
dent interest and support.
The intramural program is a relatively new development, and
has supplanted interclass athletics on many American campi. I kin
dreds of men compete in intramural tournaments while interclass
1 earns are limited to a few.
Interclass competition has died in the hearts of Stanford men.
Marry YVolter and his interclass committee may just as well offi
cially recognize the demise by removing it from the sports program.
