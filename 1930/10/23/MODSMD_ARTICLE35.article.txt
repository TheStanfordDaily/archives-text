W illi the inauguration yesterday of Robert Cordon Sproul as
president c»f the I niversitv of California, comes a new era in the
history of that institution. The epoch will lie marked with the per
sonality and vigor of the new executive.
Dr. Sproul's rise to his present position is one indicative of the
present age. Starting out in life as a newsboy, the new president
worked his way through college and finally became comptroller of
the university, lie held this position until the first part ot this year
when the Hoard «>f Regents selected him to replace Dr. William
Wallace Campbell, who retired.
California's new president is typical of the college executives
being installed by institutions over the country. They are affable,
hearty, "hale fellow, well met." types of executives who create good
will for their respective institutions.
Cndcr Dr. Sproul the I'niversitv of California should progress
more than it has in the past: great things are expected Irom him.
