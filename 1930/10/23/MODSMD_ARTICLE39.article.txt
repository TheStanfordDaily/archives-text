HEADS UP—At the Varsity Theatre-
Buddy Rogers, us Jack Mason,
and Helen Kane, as the sister of
the girl with whom Jack is in love,
together make '"Heads Up" about
as trite a show as ever came to
town. The early scenes are laid in
the Coast Guard training school, the
latter being on board the yacht of
the girl Jack loves, where he is
forced, through his duty as a guards
man, to arrest the captain for rum
running.
The picture makes no pretense of
having specially fine photography
and the plot is simple to the nth.
degree. Were it not for Helen Kane,
who goes "boop-oop-a-doop-ing"
through the show, it would scarcely
have a redeeming feature, but. she
can always be counted on for one
or two laughs. "Heads Up" is not
poor enough to be funny, nor is It
good enough to be seriously worth
anything. —C. H.
DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY. At
the Erlanger's Columbia Thea
tre, San Francisco.
A strange play and a fine one.
Too rarely are such plays produced.
"Death Takes a Holidyy" has all the
requisites of a success: suspense,
mystery, love, and beautiful women,
but besides, it has lines that are
long to be remembered and a buoy
ant philosophy.
The author, AlbeiVo Casella, calls
his work a magnificent adventure.
It is the adventure of Death him
self, who comes to earth for three
days to discover why men fear him
and to find out what is love. It is
the adventure of the etherial Grazia
who loves Death and follows him
back to the dark spaces when his
holiday is over.
The cast is excellent but the play
needs more than excellency to bring
out all the effects. A touch of genius
is necessary to carry off the title
role. Henry Daniel, an English stage
star making his Pacific Coast debut,
almost succceds in this, but at times
he fails to convince. Betty Ross

Clarke, also English, does the diffi
cult role of Grazia, the girl who is
searching for something beyond life.
Carmel Myers of movie fame is ex
tremely beautiful as Alda, and pos
sesses a lovely voice. Histrionic
honors go perhaps to Alfred Hick
man as the old baron who draws
many laughs.
The same set is used for the en
tire three acts. It is pleasing and the
various lighting effects help much
to produce an uncanny atmosphere.
"Death Takes a Holiday" is a fin
ished production and while some
thing may be lacking in the acting,
it must be remembered that, al
though it is a thoroughly enjoyable
play, it is also a difficult one. —N. J.
POOR NIGGER. By Orio Vergani.
Bohhs-Merrill Co., New York,
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Although he became world's
champion boxer, George Boykin,
dusky simple savage of Orio Ver
gani's "Poor Nigger," never could
understand civilization.
Eventually it killed him.
Out from the turbulent depths of
the African jungle, by chance he
drifted to confront modernity. To
Europe he went ,there to be utterly
bewildered by the new world. He
worked when he could find work
to do. Then he fought, first for his
board and room, then for small
purses, then for great sums of
money.
No one could defeat him—only
the life of our century could send
him eventually mad,, racing down
the streets of New York to his
death.
Vergani has painted his black
fighter, whose career parallels that
of Battling Siki, who came from
Africa to win every fight he fought
and to be mysteriously murdered in
New York some ypars ago, in a
series of primitive drawings in
harsh colors. Although not an im
portant novel, it is nevertheless
worth reading. —J. McG.

DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY. At
the Erlanger's Columbia Thea
tre, San Francisco.
A strange play and a fine one.
Too rarely are such plays produced.
"Death Takes a Holidyy" has all the
requisites of a success: suspense,
mystery, love, and beautiful women,
but besides, it has lines that are
long to be remembered and a buoy
ant philosophy.
The author, AlbeiVo Casella, calls
his work a magnificent adventure.
It is the adventure of Death him
self, who comes to earth for three
days to discover why men fear him
and to find out what is love. It is
the adventure of the etherial Grazia
who loves Death and follows him
back to the dark spaces when his
holiday is over.
The cast is excellent but the play
needs more than excellency to bring
out all the effects. A touch of genius
is necessary to carry off the title
role. Henry Daniel, an English stage
star making his Pacific Coast debut,
almost succceds in this, but at times
he fails to convince. Betty Ross

Clarke, also English, does the diffi
cult role of Grazia, the girl who is
searching for something beyond life.
Carmel Myers of movie fame is ex
tremely beautiful as Alda, and pos
sesses a lovely voice. Histrionic
honors go perhaps to Alfred Hick
man as the old baron who draws
many laughs.
The same set is used for the en
tire three acts. It is pleasing and the
various lighting effects help much
to produce an uncanny atmosphere.
"Death Takes a Holiday" is a fin
ished production and while some
thing may be lacking in the acting,
it must be remembered that, al
though it is a thoroughly enjoyable
play, it is also a difficult one. —N. J.
POOR NIGGER. By Orio Vergani.
Bohhs-Merrill Co., New York,
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Although he became world's
champion boxer, George Boykin,
dusky simple savage of Orio Ver
gani's "Poor Nigger," never could
understand civilization.
Eventually it killed him.
Out from the turbulent depths of
the African jungle, by chance he
drifted to confront modernity. To
Europe he went ,there to be utterly
bewildered by the new world. He
worked when he could find work
to do. Then he fought, first for his
board and room, then for small
purses, then for great sums of
money.
No one could defeat him—only
the life of our century could send
him eventually mad,, racing down
the streets of New York to his
death.
Vergani has painted his black
fighter, whose career parallels that
of Battling Siki, who came from
Africa to win every fight he fought
and to be mysteriously murdered in
New York some ypars ago, in a
series of primitive drawings in
harsh colors. Although not an im
portant novel, it is nevertheless
worth reading. —J. McG.

the Erlanger's Columbia Thea
tre, San Francisco.
A strange play and a fine one.
Too rarely are such plays produced.
"Death Takes a Holidyy" has all the
requisites of a success: suspense,
mystery, love, and beautiful women,
but besides, it has lines that are
long to be remembered and a buoy
ant philosophy.
The author, AlbeiVo Casella, calls
his work a magnificent adventure.
It is the adventure of Death him
self, who comes to earth for three
days to discover why men fear him
and to find out what is love. It is
the adventure of the etherial Grazia
who loves Death and follows him
back to the dark spaces when his
holiday is over.
The cast is excellent but the play
needs more than excellency to bring
out all the effects. A touch of genius
is necessary to carry off the title
role. Henry Daniel, an English stage
star making his Pacific Coast debut,
almost succceds in this, but at times
he fails to convince. Betty Ross

Clarke, also English, does the diffi
cult role of Grazia, the girl who is
searching for something beyond life.
Carmel Myers of movie fame is ex
tremely beautiful as Alda, and pos
sesses a lovely voice. Histrionic
honors go perhaps to Alfred Hick
man as the old baron who draws
many laughs.
The same set is used for the en
tire three acts. It is pleasing and the
various lighting effects help much
to produce an uncanny atmosphere.
"Death Takes a Holiday" is a fin
ished production and while some
thing may be lacking in the acting,
it must be remembered that, al
though it is a thoroughly enjoyable
play, it is also a difficult one. —N. J.
POOR NIGGER. By Orio Vergani.
Bohhs-Merrill Co., New York,
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Although he became world's
champion boxer, George Boykin,
dusky simple savage of Orio Ver
gani's "Poor Nigger," never could
understand civilization.
Eventually it killed him.
Out from the turbulent depths of
the African jungle, by chance he
drifted to confront modernity. To
Europe he went ,there to be utterly
bewildered by the new world. He
worked when he could find work
to do. Then he fought, first for his
board and room, then for small
purses, then for great sums of
money.
No one could defeat him—only
the life of our century could send
him eventually mad,, racing down
the streets of New York to his
death.
Vergani has painted his black
fighter, whose career parallels that
of Battling Siki, who came from
Africa to win every fight he fought
and to be mysteriously murdered in
New York some ypars ago, in a
series of primitive drawings in
harsh colors. Although not an im
portant novel, it is nevertheless
worth reading. —J. McG.
