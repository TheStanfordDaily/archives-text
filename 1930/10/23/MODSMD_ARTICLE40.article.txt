A STANFORD WAR HERO
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford University has already,
in her record of the few years, less
than 40, since she was born of the
grief of parents bereaved, greatly
distinguished herself and won a
place all her own among American
universities. But there is one honor
of surpassing splendor, won 13 years
ago by a son of "Leland Stanford,"
vmique, unparalleled, and unlikely
to be duplicated in her future
career, that seems already to have
passed almost into oblivion. I mean
the fact that the first American flag
that was unfurled in service on the
French Front in the Great War
with the official sanction of the
American government after our be
lated entrance into the war was
carried by Arthur Clifford Kimber,
a Stanford man (191(5 and 1917),
who, as a member of the Second
Stanford Unit, was sent over in ad
vance to present the flag to the
First Stanford Unit of the Ameri
can Ambulance Field Service which
was already in service in France.
How well and gallantly he executed
that high and responsible mission
is thrillingly told in a little book,
"The Story of the First Flag," writ
ten by Mrs. Clara Kimber, Clif
ford's mother.
That glorious pennon lies today
stacked with two or three others
against the wall in a vestibule of
the Memorial Church, moldering in
dusty oblivion, and the majority of

Stanford men and women, as I
have recently to my dismay discov
ever, seem actually unaware of its
existence, are ignorant of the epic
drama connected with it, and have
never heard the very name of the
hero, a real one, of that history
making adventure. The other after
noon I took the liberty of showing
the First Flag to a few strangers
who were in the Memorial' Church.
They read the inscription with
which the two silver plates on the
staff are engraved—"This flag,
blessed by the Bishop of California,
is the first American flag to be car
ried in service on the French Front,
with the official sanction of the
American Government"—and one
of the little group, a lady, lifting
the silk to her lips, kissed it rever
ently and said, "Stanford University
possesses nothing more sacred or
precious than this flag." "Nor," I
added, "is any of her sons more
worthy of a halo in all her annals
than Arthur Clifford Kimber."
On September 26, 1918, while fly
ing with his patrol above the Ger
man lines, his plane was blown to
bits, and today somewhere in.
French soil lies all that was mortal
of "one of the bravest American
aviators" as the commanding of
ficer of his squadron described him,
the Stanford man who carried the
first American flag to the -Great
War.
