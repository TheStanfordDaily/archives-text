After yelling ourselves purple in
the face (purple, being a royal color,
means that we showed our pride in
the team) at the rally, we actually
succeeded in dancing with four dif
ferent women, at the Jolly-Jam. The
rest of the time we spent looking
for the two we wanted to dance
with again.
One of these, a freshman, gave tis
her compact for safe-keeping—we
still have it—and oh! What is her
name? She has bluish eyes and
brownish hair and we were going
to ask her for a date to the Cream
ery, sometime . . . (File your ap
plication blanks and identification
cards at the Daily office, girls. Line
forms to the right of Prexy's Hill.)
Which reminds us that the
Ifill will have to he re-named, if
the big house remains empty
much longer. If looks so forbid
ding and neglected. Of course,
it adds unquestionable "class"
to the campus, tbus maintaining
a home for occasional visiting
royalty. It's rather like Prince

I Carol's winter house, or some
thing—only Carol came hack to
stay . . .
Yesterday morning, our Berkeley
rival installed a new president, with
much chiming of Campanile bells, (
and visiting presidents and profes- I
sors. Yes, thank heaven—professors
! from Stanford were among those
present, and somebody got a cut
from sort of class. Guess Cal stu
dents wore excused from classess, I
I too . . . Now, il we could only do j
something to be nice to them in
return. ...
Taking a walk in the 4 hills back
of the campus, yesterday, we sud
denly felt rustically inclined and
started classifying animals. The
prize animal collection is dogs,
which we list for your amusement l
and edification about conditions in I
the dog market:
For bean-lovers, Boston; for
tobacco chewers, Spits; for lazy
persons. Police; for Shakespear-
I ians (interpreters of Hamlet),

Taking a walk in the 4 hills back
of the campus, yesterday, we sud
denly felt rustically inclined and
started classifying animals. The
prize animal collection is dogs,
which we list for your amusement l
and edification about conditions in I
the dog market:
For bean-lovers, Boston; for
tobacco chewers, Spits; for lazy
persons. Police; for Shakespear-
I ians (interpreters of Hamlet),
After yelling ourselves purple in
the face (purple, being a royal color,
means that we showed our pride in
the team) at the rally, we actually
succeeded in dancing with four dif
ferent women, at the Jolly-Jam. The
rest of the time we spent looking
for the two we wanted to dance
with again.
One of these, a freshman, gave tis
her compact for safe-keeping—we
still have it—and oh! What is her
name? She has bluish eyes and
brownish hair and we were going
to ask her for a date to the Cream
ery, sometime . . . (File your ap
plication blanks and identification
cards at the Daily office, girls. Line
forms to the right of Prexy's Hill.)
Which reminds us that the
Ifill will have to he re-named, if
the big house remains empty
much longer. If looks so forbid
ding and neglected. Of course,
it adds unquestionable "class"
to the campus, tbus maintaining
a home for occasional visiting
royalty. It's rather like Prince

I Carol's winter house, or some
thing—only Carol came hack to
stay . . .
Yesterday morning, our Berkeley
rival installed a new president, with
much chiming of Campanile bells, (
and visiting presidents and profes- I
sors. Yes, thank heaven—professors
! from Stanford were among those
present, and somebody got a cut
from sort of class. Guess Cal stu
dents wore excused from classess, I
I too . . . Now, il we could only do j
something to be nice to them in
return. ...
