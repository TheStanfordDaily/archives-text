The Princeton paper says that
race horses an dathletes require
delicate handling. Perhaps so, but

the race horses are more fortunate.
A professor at Wesleyan Uni
versity says that love has no cash
value. That may have been the
case when you took the girl

sor in question never took a

The head football coach at Wis
consin University makes a statement
to the effect that athletics is one
field where a man can give every
thing he has without expecting any

No doubt, the report of the Car
negie football investigation has not

eted thing possible?
The University of Minnesota
has inaugurated a plan of start
ing a fire siren to stop lengthy
and uninteresting speakers.
Perhaps the ideal university will

fire siren to shut off dry professors.
But the danger with such a system
is that the professor would probably
never get further his lecture than
"the subject for today is . . ."
