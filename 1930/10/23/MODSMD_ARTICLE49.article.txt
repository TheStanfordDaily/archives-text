When the Cardinal of Stanford
laets the Red and Gold of the Uni
ersitv of Southern California, a
housand rivalries and feuds are
lound up in that meeting. Not only
s the rivalry that of teams, but it
lso includes that of coaches, play
ng units, men, bands, rooting sec
ions, and the like.
Saturday will be no exception,
ivt'r since last New Year's Day
vhen Pop said "Hello" to Jock
•ulhcrland, "Headman" Jones, as he
s called by the Daily Trojan, has
»een walking around nursing a pet
teeve against the Cardinal mentor,
knd now Ibis peeve is due to burst
villi all its fury upon the unpro
tected head of Warner when Jones
inleasltes his Thundering Herd
ipon the defenseless Redshirts.
Even Nibs Price of California has
ound it fashionable to foam at the
nouth and exhibit other symptoms
vhen the name Warner is paraded
tefore his ears. But Nibs can wait
in til Howard of Los Angeles has
lad his opportunity, for by right of
>riority Jones can claim the first
ruits of Warner's attention.
Perhaps Jones will be forced to
vait until some other time to exact
ribute from Warner for alleged in
ustices. Things might come to such
i low ebb that Warner will be
orced to give Jones the opportunity
>112 turning the other cheek during
he course of Saturday's afternoon.
\t any rate, the numbers on the
corcboard should indicate the
imotint of Jones's retribution, if
my.
A year ago, a large and formidable
;ent stationed at end played merry
-fades with Warner's pet plays. In
act, if Jones could have found a
vhite sweatshirt for him, that end
night have been given the ball by
Cardinal backs on numerous plays
jnder the impression that he had
:hanged sides.
Now during (he 1929 Troy-Card
fame, there also appeared on the
Stanford flanks a white-thatched
•hap playing his first year in fast
rompany, and (he gratifying way in
rvhicli he eliminated the Southern
: alilornia interference brought joy
oi many heavy hearts that day.
Saturday, through the courtesy of
he Board of Athletic Control, a re
urn engagement of their act has
Deien arranged. "Arbelbide and
Veil 1," the program reads, "play
lumming specialists." While the
spectators hold their breath, the
3oys will go into their dance. At
he end of sixty minutes of rapid
ire repartee an all-American is ex
pected to emerge from the melee,
ind as such will be crowned by
he Sabbath scribes.
Another feature of the billing is
he IMoffatt-Dufficld quarrel. Phil
ind Marsh, as they are admiringly
ermed by their followers, while not

In fact, Duffield was so hard to
ind in 1929 that the referee was
orced to call him back after he lost
limself behind the Cardinal goal
ine on one occasion. After this
aux pas, the good Trojan never
jermitted the same mistake to hap
jen again, but passed the buck to
Pappaan, much to the Redshirts'

When the Cardinal of Stanford
laets the Red and Gold of the Uni
ersitv of Southern California, a
housand rivalries and feuds are
lound up in that meeting. Not only
s the rivalry that of teams, but it
lso includes that of coaches, play
ng units, men, bands, rooting sec
ions, and the like.
Saturday will be no exception,
ivt'r since last New Year's Day
vhen Pop said "Hello" to Jock

s called by the Daily Trojan, has

teeve against the Cardinal mentor,
knd now Ibis peeve is due to burst
villi all its fury upon the unpro
tected head of Warner when Jones
inleasltes his Thundering Herd
ipon the defenseless Redshirts.
Even Nibs Price of California has
ound it fashionable to foam at the
nouth and exhibit other symptoms
vhen the name Warner is paraded
tefore his ears. But Nibs can wait
in til Howard of Los Angeles has
lad his opportunity, for by right of
>riority Jones can claim the first
ruits of Warner's attention.
Perhaps Jones will be forced to
vait until some other time to exact
ribute from Warner for alleged in
ustices. Things might come to such
i low ebb that Warner will be
orced to give Jones the opportunity
>112 turning the other cheek during

corcboard should indicate the
