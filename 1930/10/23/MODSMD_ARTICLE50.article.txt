# Babe Gridmen Set For Gael Game On Saturday
## YEARLINGS MAKE READY FOR GAME WITH ST. MARY'S Injuries Hamper Frosh As Conflict With Gaels Draws Near 
### 
Working with a partially crippled
team, Coach Jimmy "Rabbit" Brad
shaw is faced with the problem of
getting his babe gridmen in shape
for Saturday's tilt with Saint Mary's,
and then pulling through this game
with enough left to turn back the
Trojan invasion the following week.
With the contests between the
yearling squads of California's "Big
Three" considered conference tilts
in the freshman ranks, the schedule
which puts such a tough aggrega
tion as the Saints in the way before
the U.S.C. tussle is not particularly
favorable to the Card chances.
There is little chance that Edelen,
first string Card left end, will be
able to play Saturday. He has been
cn the sidelines with a bad leg since
the Bruin game in the South last
week. Anderson, full for the babes,
has been running signals in prac
tice, though he also may be out of
the game with an injured kn >e.
Gould Probable Guard
Tarver, at guard, is bothered with
a charlie-horse which may keep
him on the bench, in which case
Bradshaw will probably start Gould.
Miles, another guard, sustained a
broken nose in the Southern battle.
At present the Card chances with
U.S.C. a week following the fray
with the hard-lighting Gaels do not
look any too bright. The Trojan
babes are undefeated so far, hav
ing downed Santa Ana J.C., Chaffee
J.C., and the Bear Cubs, the latter
going down under Troy's attack by
a 27 to 0 score.
The Saints also downed California
by a large count, so if Bradshaw's
babes win out in Saturday's contest
without being hit by more injuries,
their chances against the Troy year
lings will be more encouraging.
