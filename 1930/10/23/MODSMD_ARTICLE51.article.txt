# SAN JOSE SOCCER PLAYERS WIN FROM FAST CARD FROSH
## 
### 
Lapses of uncertainty at critical
moments cost the Stanford fresh
man soccer team a 5-1 defeat at the
I hands of San Jose State in a fast
but ragged game here yesterday
afternoon. Although San Jose was
clearly the superior team they were
| not as overwhelming as the score
indicates, and a strong goal defense
Ion the part of the freshmen would
have made it a 1-1 or 2-1 tilt."
Led by Taylor, hard-working
center halfback, the valley boys
played a faster game and displayed
I better individual ability than the
| Cards, but lacked sufficient team
i play to hold complete command of
j the situation, and in consequence
| the freshmen were able to threaten
their opponents' goal occasionally
| and to score once.
Play early in the first half was
1 fairly even. About half way through
a slow, dribbling kick along the
ground evaded Marx, Stanford
' goalie, and rolled into the net for
the first score of the game. Some
i what later the ball hit the Card
1 net again, but no goal was counted,
because it had been knocked in by
a shoulder. At the intermission the
score was 1-0 in favor of San Jose.

never any doubt as to the eventual
winner, for although play was in
both ends of the field, the teachers
displayed more power, being able
to cash in on scoring opportunities,
something the frosh could not do
until near the end of the contest
when Hern finally succeeded in get
ting a good kick at the ball from
in front of the goal.
