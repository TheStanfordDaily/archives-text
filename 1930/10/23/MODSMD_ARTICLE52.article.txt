# ROAR! ROAR! ROAR!
## Ralph Hewit Is Most Dangerous Lion in Columbia's Backfield; Flashed Against Wesleyan 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Ralph Hewitt, Columbia quarter
back, is one of those players on
whose head and shoulders the spot
light just naturally shines. He is a
fine all-around player, who does
1 very well against the weaker teams
or "setups" that most big colleges
and universities meet on the grid
iron early in the season, and he also
shines to advantage against the
larger and more formidable oppon
ents as well. Running back the
opening kickoff to a touchdown
against Wesleyan. as Hewitt did on
October 11, is in no way comparable
to the feat of Downs —the Georgia
captain—against Yale on the same
afternoon, but Ralph Hewitt fol
' lowed this little excursion up with
two other touchdown trips during
the game, and he also tossed for
ward passes to teammates for two
other scores.
Hewitt is a real triple-threat play
er, and what is more he has a style
and a classy way about him in his

I gridiron activities that make him
stand out from the mob. He kicks,
runs, tosses forward and lateral
' passes, and backs up the line as a
real big league player should do,
and under the tutelage of Coach
Lou Little he is rapidly developing
into a real brainy quarterback.
Hewitt is Columbia's Titan, its re
liance, and its hero, but the Lions
i haven't a one-man team by a long
! ways, and Ralph has good help in
the backfield from Rivero, Mosser,
: and Stanczyk, and in Remy Tys at
end. Coach Lou Little does not ex
pect too much in his first season,
; especially as he has such a*small
| squad to work with. (There are
j 36,587 students registered at Colum
bia and about forty on the football
squad!)
Hewitt's speed, power, and skill
may yet rank him with such Blue
j and White gridiron immortals as
Harold Weekes, Bill Morley, Tom
j Thorp, and Walter Koppisch.
