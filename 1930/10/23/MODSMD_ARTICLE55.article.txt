# FANS TO WITNESS FEMININE STARS IN GOLF EXHIBITIONS
## Saturday's Rounds Will Lower Course Record Is Expectation 
### Stewart Crawford 
There is some speculation as to
what will happen to the women's
record for the University course
next Saturday when the delegation
of feminine satellites negotiate the
difficult 18 holes which comprise the
local layout.
Though the fair divot diggers will
not be pressed as in competitive golf,
there is reason to suspect that the
80 which now stands as the best
women's 'score will be at a disad
vantage against an attack by Glenna
Coilett, Helen Hicks, Virginia Van
Wie, Maureen Orcutt, and Mrs. O.'
S. Hill.
Par Set At 81
With par at 81 for feminine play
ers, Farm golf enthusiasts may be
treated to seeing that mark equalled
Saturday. However, with the back
tees in order for the feminine in
vasion, it will take some brilliant
playing to upset this par figure. The
record for men from these tees is
76.
Mrs. Brent Potter is the present
holder of the mark of 86, together
with Mrs. Vera Hutchings, Cana
dian women's champion. Mrs. Pot
ter will be here to try to better this
score Saturday.
Stars Break Records
Course records galore have fallen
before the onslaught of the stars to
be seen here. Last Monday Edith
Quier set a new one with a brilliant
round of 81 on the Pasatiempo
Country Club course at Santa Cruz.
Glenna Coilett holds the women's
record for low score on the Cypress
Point course, having turned in a 76
there last year.
Since a great deal of traffic from
San Francisco is expected to con
gest conditions near the course Sat
urday, it is the request of Garry
Bennett, golf coach, that as few stu
dents as possible go to the exhibi
tion" in ears.
The play starts at 9 o'clock. There
will be no gallery fee.
