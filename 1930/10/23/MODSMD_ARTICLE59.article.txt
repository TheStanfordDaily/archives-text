# WEEKLY TRACK MEET WILL BE TOMORROW
## 
### 
The regular weekly practice track
meet will be held tomorrow after
noon at 4:20 o'clock at the practice
oval, Bill Ellington, assistant coach,
announced last night.
Much better times were made on
the cinder trails last Friday than
the week previous, and a further
lowering in many of the events is
expected tomorrow.
