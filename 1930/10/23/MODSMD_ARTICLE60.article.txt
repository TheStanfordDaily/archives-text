# GIFTED GIRLS LOSE SUPERIORITY FASTER THAN GIFTED BOYS
## 
### 
Gifted girls do not maintain their
superiority in adolescence to the
same extent that boys do, but tend
to revert to average in mental abil
ity as adolescence approaches.
This is one of the interesting con
clusions reached by Dr. Lewis M.
Terman, head of Stanford Univer
sity Psychology Department, in the
third volume of his famous "Genetic
Studies of Genius" series, released
November 1 by the University
Press.
"The Promise of Youth," under
which title this third volume ap
pears, is a follow-up study of the
initial volume of the series, "Men
tal and Physical Traits of a Thou
sand Gifted Children." It reports the
progress made in high school and
college years by the superior group
selected for the first study, which
was reported in 1925.
Among other points brought to
light in the new volume are that
gifted children come from superior
families; that these families have
greatly decreased fecundity and
are not maintaining themselves;
that gifted children are superior to
the generality of children in health
and physique; that school achieve
ment continues through high school
and college on a line with the IQ
found in the original study; that
subject failures in high school are
almost never incurred.
In general this later study "bears
out very well the tentative conclu
sions developed in Volume I," ac
cording to Dr. Terman.
