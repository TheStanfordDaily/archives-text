After 5-he U.S.C game
A BIG STANFORD NIGHT
AT HOTEL OAKLAND
'
In a gay setting of Stanford Colors and
the Big Stadium Banner "Chuck" Dutton
and his Hotel Oakland Ivory Court Dance
Orchestra will play all the good old Stan
ford tunes . . . Pearman, Brickley and
Matesky, talented Stanford dancers and
the Cardinal Quartet will entertain . . .
There'll be bright favors, balloons, ir
resistible syncopation, life, color, action,
laughter.
No foolin' . . . It'll be a REAL STAN
FORD NIGHT and we advise reservations
NOW. Dinner De Luxe is $2.00 the plate
with no couvert. Seventy-five cent cou
vert with other service. And, remember,
it's a faster trip over 34 miles of good,
clear highway, via Dumbarton Bridge,
than up the Peninsula.
