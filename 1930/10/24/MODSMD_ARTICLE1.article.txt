# TRUSTEES GRANT WILBUR'S REQUEST FOR YEAR'S LEAVE
## SWAIN TO HAVE FULL POWER AS STANFORD HEAD Wilbur's Salary As Chief Executive To Be Discontinued LEAVE ENDS IN AUGUST 
### 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
yesterday granted the application of
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur for a one
year's extension of his leave of ab
sense from the presidency of the
University.
At the same time, the trustees
transferred the full powers of the
presidency from Di\ Wilbur to Dr.
Robert Eckles Swain, who again is
to be acting-president during Dr.
Wilbur's absence from this institu
tion.
Dr. Wilbur is at present secretary
of the interior in President Hoover's
cabinet.
Salary Discontinued
The absent-on-leave executive
will not be given his salary, accord
ing to a statement issued by the
board at the conclusion of its meet
ing. Dr. Wilbur was reported to have
received $22,000 a year from the
University while occupying the sec
retaryship during the past year.
Dr. Wilbur's leave expired August
31, but because a quorum of the
Board of Trustees was not available
no decision on his application for
an extension .could be made at that
time.
Leave Ends Next August
The extension of the leave will
end August 31, 1931, at which time
the board will probably call upon
the secretary to make a choice be
tween his cabinet position and the
presidency of the University, Wil
liam Mayo Newhall, president of the
board of trustees, declared.
Dr. Wilbur's term in the secre
taryship is due to last for an in
definite period until President Hoo
ver is replaced by another execu
tive; President Hoover recently de
clared Dr. Wilbur to be too valu
able a man for the federal govern
ment to lose.
Dr. Wilbur asked that his leave
be extended because of a "number
of highly important national activi
ties."
