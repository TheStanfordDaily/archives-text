j MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Oct. 23
(/P). â€”In the opinion of Dr. E. Starr
I J udd, president-elect of the Ameri
j can Medical Association, the golden
age of medical discovery lies ahead.
The possibilities of the future, Dr.
J udd said today, are fully as great
as the accomplishments of the last
decades.
"We probably have just begun,"
he told the assembly of the Inter
state Post Graduate Medical Asso
ciation of North America. "We can
| not tell what research holds just
around the corner, but certainly the
belief so often expressed that medi
cine has gone as far as it can, is in
error."
