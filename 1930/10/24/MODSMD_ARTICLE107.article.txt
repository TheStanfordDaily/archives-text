# ULTRA-VIOLET RAY CREATOR OF LIFE SAYS DEAN CUTTER
## Dean Of Medicine Believes Conditions Different At Time Of Origin 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 23. I A')—A scien
tific conception of the origin of life
—that protoplasm was activiuted
into life by ultra-violet light rays
of a power now unknown, was ex
plained today by Dr. Irving S. Cut
ter, dean of the Northwestern Uni
versity Medical School.
In a lecture on contemporary
though before the Medill School of
Journalism, Dr. Cutter said that life
arose amid conditions which have
disappeared from the earth, never
to return.
''It seems certain that ultra-violet
light from a sun far hotter than it
is today played a predominant part
in bringing about complex chemical
combinations. We can visualize the
stupendous forces, radio-chemical in
character, acting upon new-born
chemical groups Just such forces
radio-activity of high degree and
powerful ultra-violet rays of the
sun—can explain chemical combina
tions now denied the hand of man,"
he said.
"As the earth cooled and radio
activity lessened, so ultra-violet
light from the sun decreased and
living matter then took unto itself
its own continuance — metabolism
and reproduction."
