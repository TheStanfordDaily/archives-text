# U.S.C. WAR HORSE ADOPTED IN 1920 AS TROJAN MASCOT
## Newspaper Man Suggests Prancing Steed After Viewing Game 
### 
"Those boys certainly fight like |
Trojans," remarked a sports editor ;
of the Los Angeles Times fifteen ;
years ago on seeing the U.S.C. foot
hall team put up another losing
light in one of their big games. B-- 1
cause of this minor comment the
Southern university optimistically j
adopted Troy as their symbol—for- |
getting, perhaps, that in the end
Troy fell.
It is true that Troy did hold out j
for ten years, but finally wasn't the
famous Trojan horse the cause of
the downfall? Horses seem to be j
risky things to pin one's faith in— i
especially Trojan horses! And it is j
a well-known fact that history does I
repeat itself.
The Trojan warrior, with his
fighting spirit in the face of a los
ing battle, was chosen on so slight
a remark as the semi-official sym
bol of the university. A dignified
Trojan shrine has recently been ,
erected in front of their Adminis
tration Building, further carrying J
out the reverence felt for the idea. 1
The Trojan War Horse was not
used until in 1920. Burdette Henney,
Southern California yell king, en
larged on the Trojan theme by in
troducing it into bleacher stunts
during the games. Since that time
the various stunts have figured
around the prancing steed.
Tomorrow Stanford will be the
first university to see the 1930 edi
tion of the Trojan War Horse stunt,
when it will be put on between the
halves of the game. This stunt is
reserved for the Southern univer
sity's most important games and has
been especially worked up for the
season this year.
Since 1921) U.S.C.'s luck has been
good. Except for two years when
they were forced to recoil before
the Stanford onslaught their suc
cess against the Cardinals has been
exceptional. Evidently the spirit of
Troy has spurred them on.
BUT the ten years are over this
year! We shall see. We shall sec.

"Those boys certainly fight like |
Trojans," remarked a sports editor ;
of the Los Angeles Times fifteen ;
years ago on seeing the U.S.C. foot
hall team put up another losing
light in one of their big games. B-- 1
cause of this minor comment the
Southern university optimistically j
adopted Troy as their symbol—for- |
getting, perhaps, that in the end
Troy fell.
It is true that Troy did hold out j
for ten years, but finally wasn't the
famous Trojan horse the cause of
the downfall? Horses seem to be j
risky things to pin one's faith in— i
especially Trojan horses! And it is j
a well-known fact that history does I
repeat itself.
The Trojan warrior, with his
fighting spirit in the face of a los
ing battle, was chosen on so slight
a remark as the semi-official sym
bol of the university. A dignified
Trojan shrine has recently been ,
erected in front of their Adminis
tration Building, further carrying J
out the reverence felt for the idea. 1
The Trojan War Horse was not
used until in 1920. Burdette Henney,
Southern California yell king, en
larged on the Trojan theme by in
troducing it into bleacher stunts
during the games. Since that time
the various stunts have figured
around the prancing steed.
Tomorrow Stanford will be the
first university to see the 1930 edi
tion of the Trojan War Horse stunt,
when it will be put on between the
halves of the game. This stunt is
reserved for the Southern univer
sity's most important games and has
been especially worked up for the
season this year.
