# PLAY SEASON BEGINS WITH LIGHT FARCE
## Katherine Keho Has Title Role In Comedy To Be Played Tonight 
### 
Katherine Keho will appear to
night in the title role of "Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh," Harry James
Smith's farcical comedy, to be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall, at 8:30
o'clock, under the direction of
Harold Helvenston. The play opens
the campus dramatic season.
The part of Mrs. Bumpstead-
Leigh, made famous by one of the
greatest American comediennes,
Mrs. Fiske, is the most difficult of
Katherine Keho's career. It is her
first sophisticated role, one which
requires vigor and a sense of high
comedy. She has already gained
recognition as Maggie in, "What
Every Woman Knows"; Princess
Lilia, in "The Ivory Door"; Judith,
in "Granite"; and Eliza Doolittle, in
the summer quarter production of
"Pygmalion."
Has Clever Situations
"Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh" is a play
of several situations. Many minor
plots are interwoven through the
theme adding many clever situations
and giving rise to sparkling lines.
Especially entertaining are the
scenes between the heroine and her
rather moronic mother, who will be
enacted by Mina Hughes, for as soon
as the other characters have left the
stage, the heroine drops her affec
tation of British speech and falls
into the familiar American slang,
pronounced with the accent of Mis
sionary Loop, Indiana,

as the other characters have left the
stage, the heroine drops her affec
tation of British speech and falls
into the familiar American slang,
pronounced with the accent of Mis
sionary Loop, Indiana,
