## 
### J. Rolph Malloch 
Second in interest only to the Big
Game, the meeting tomorrow on the
football field of Stanford and U.S.C.
has 25 years of intermittent, bit
terly-fought competition behind it.
The contests between these two
rivals have rarely resulted in a dull
game.
The first game between Stanford
and Southern California was played
in 1905, when Lanagan was the Card
coach. U.S.C. had a powerful team,
but in the Redshivts they were meet
ing one of the strongest outfits on
the coast, coached by a man who in
his entire career at Stanford never
lost a game to California. Led by
Vandervoort, left halfback, Lana
gan's men drove through the line of
nating two marches with touch
nating tow marches with touch
downs, and winning 16-0.

When the Cards and Trojans next
met, in 1910, the star of the Card
eleven was Dink Templeton, present
Stanford track coach. Templeton's
punting far outclassed the Troy
punters, but breaks gave the game
to the southerners, 13-0. Fumbles
cost Stanford the game again in
1920. The 1922 eleven dropped a
6-0 decision to the Trojans before
20,000 spectators in the new Stan
ford stadium. The Trojans won the
1923 contest by blocking four of
Ernie Nevers' punts.

A Stanford victory came in 1925,
when Mike Murphy, sophomore
quarterback, raced 65 yards to the
winning touchdown of a close gamq.
Victory In 1926
One of the most successful years
the Cardinals have ever had in
American football came in 1926, but
Warner's men were barely able to
nose out the Thundering Herd by
the narrow margin of one point.
U.S.C. put over two touchdowns in
the first half, but. the Cards made a
fast comeback that started when
Bogue found all his intended pass
receivers covered and decided to
run instead of passing. He was
stopped on the 5 yard line, and Biff
Hoffman took the ball over. Later
on Dick Hyland flashed some of his
famous speed and snagged a 41 yard
pass from Hoffman, running 15 more
yards to the winning tally. Final
score was 13-12.
Perhaps the most exciting of this
series of encounters was the 1927
game. With only two minutes left
to play, Stanford was trailing 13-7.
A couple of prayerful passes put
the ball on (he S.C. 21-yard mark
and then Herb Fleishhacker pounded
through the middle of the powerful
Trojan line for 18 yards in successive
bucks. With 30 seconds left to play,
a tricky pass to the Card righ end
tied the score. The convert was mis
sed.
In 1928 the men of Troy, under
Howard Jones, won their first game
from a Warner-coached team by a
i 10-0 count.
Going into the game heavy fa
vorites, the Rcdshirts threatened the
I Trojan goal three times in the first
half, but failed to score. In the sec
ond half the Trojans had the situa
tion well in hand, executing a neat
i forward pass and a place-kicked
i field goal for a total of 10 points and
the game.
Last year both goals were threat
ened a number of limes, but the
I Trojans scored the only touchdown
j by a beautiful pass from Duffield to
Tappaan, followed by a fast ten
yard run by the latter. In the first
half, the Cards had the ball, first
down, on the Trojan's 4-yard line,
I but failed in four trys to buck the
ball over.

cost Stanford the game again in

Victory In 1926
One of the most successful years
the Cardinals have ever had in
American football came in 1926, but
Warner's men were barely able to
nose out the Thundering Herd by
the narrow margin of one point.
U.S.C. put over two touchdowns in
the first half, but. the Cards made a
fast comeback that started when
Bogue found all his intended pass
receivers covered and decided to
run instead of passing. He was
stopped on the 5 yard line, and Biff
Hoffman took the ball over. Later
on Dick Hyland flashed some of his
famous speed and snagged a 41 yard
pass from Hoffman, running 15 more
yards to the winning tally. Final
score was 13-12.
Perhaps the most exciting of this
series of encounters was the 1927
game. With only two minutes left
to play, Stanford was trailing 13-7.
A couple of prayerful passes put
the ball on (he S.C. 21-yard mark
and then Herb Fleishhacker pounded
through the middle of the powerful
Trojan line for 18 yards in successive
bucks. With 30 seconds left to play,
a tricky pass to the Card righ end
tied the score. The convert was mis
sed.
In 1928 the men of Troy, under
Howard Jones, won their first game
from a Warner-coached team by a
i 10-0 count.
Going into the game heavy fa
vorites, the Rcdshirts threatened the
I Trojan goal three times in the first
half, but failed to score. In the sec
ond half the Trojans had the situa
tion well in hand, executing a neat
i forward pass and a place-kicked
i field goal for a total of 10 points and
the game.
Last year both goals were threat
ened a number of limes, but the
I Trojans scored the only touchdown
j by a beautiful pass from Duffield to
Tappaan, followed by a fast ten
yard run by the latter. In the first
half, the Cards had the ball, first
down, on the Trojan's 4-yard line,
I but failed in four trys to buck the
ball over.
Second in interest only to the Big
Game, the meeting tomorrow on the
football field of Stanford and U.S.C.

The contests between these two
rivals have rarely resulted in a dull
game.
The first game between Stanford
and Southern California was played
in 1905, when Lanagan was the Card
coach. U.S.C. had a powerful team,

the first half, but. the Cards made a
fast comeback that started when
Bogue found all his intended pass
receivers covered and decided to
run instead of passing. He was
stopped on the 5 yard line, and Biff
Hoffman took the ball over. Later
on Dick Hyland flashed some of his
famous speed and snagged a 41 yard
pass from Hoffman, running 15 more
yards to the winning tally. Final
score was 13-12.
Perhaps the most exciting of this
series of encounters was the 1927
game. With only two minutes left
to play, Stanford was trailing 13-7.
A couple of prayerful passes put
the ball on (he S.C. 21-yard mark
and then Herb Fleishhacker pounded
through the middle of the powerful
Trojan line for 18 yards in successive
bucks. With 30 seconds left to play,
a tricky pass to the Card righ end
tied the score. The convert was mis
sed.
In 1928 the men of Troy, under
Howard Jones, won their first game
from a Warner-coached team by a
i 10-0 count.
Going into the game heavy fa
vorites, the Rcdshirts threatened the
I Trojan goal three times in the first
half, but failed to score. In the sec
ond half the Trojans had the situa
tion well in hand, executing a neat
i forward pass and a place-kicked
i field goal for a total of 10 points and
the game.
Last year both goals were threat
ened a number of limes, but the
I Trojans scored the only touchdown
j by a beautiful pass from Duffield to
Tappaan, followed by a fast ten
yard run by the latter. In the first
half, the Cards had the ball, first
down, on the Trojan's 4-yard line,
I but failed in four trys to buck the
ball over.
