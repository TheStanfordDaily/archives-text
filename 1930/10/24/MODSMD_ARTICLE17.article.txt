# FACULTY, STUDENTS AT U.W. DEMUR AT OUSTING OF STERN
## 
### 
Protestation on the part of both
the faculty and students of the Uni
versity of Washington has followed
the enforced resignation of Bernard
J. Stern, formerly assistant professor
in sociology, according to a recent
report in the U. of W. Daily. The
alleged infringment of "academic
freedom'' is arousing so much un
favorable comment on the northern
campus that investigation may be
turned over to the American Asso
ciation of University Professors, a
national organization.
Herman V. Tarter, chairman of
the Instructors' Association of the
University, is in charge of the fa
culty investigation of the conditions
of Dr. Stern's "dismissal." It may be
necessary, he stated, to turn the ex
amination over to the national body.
A student committee has likewise
been organized to investigate the
Stern case.
Action in the matter came as the
result of a student protest meeting
last Thursday at which several
speeches were made condemning
Steam's resignation as the result of
the "radical" religious views which
he held.
