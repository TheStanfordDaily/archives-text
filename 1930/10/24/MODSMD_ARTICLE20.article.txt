### 
Coach Howard Jones, going to the j
extremes of caution in guarding his
team's signal codes, sat as judge
Wednesday on the fate of two Stan
ford men suspected of spying out
secret footbali practice on the Tro
jan campus, it was learned yester
day.
John Kennedy, '29, and Russell
Crandall, '29, were surprised by a
band of students on the S.C. campus,
taken before Jones, and put through
a stiff grilling by him before being I
released.

The Stanford pair left their car on
the S.C. campus and went into see
Orvin Fry, '28, who is studying law
and lives near the football field.
Returning to their machine a few
moments later, Kennedy and Cran- '
dall found it surrounded by approxi
mately fifty students and Trojan
Knights, who had noticed the Stan- |
ford stickers. ,
All tires on the car had been de- ;
flated to prevent the escape of what
the vigilant Trojans thought to be j
football spies. Warning them to
come along without making any i
trouble, the crowd told the Stanford
men that Jones wanted to see them,
and they shortly hailed before the
renowned coach and several mem
bers of his staff.
Offer Appnlogics
The Trojan mentor questioned
them in a severe manner, asking
them why they were there, what
they were doing, where they lived,
their names and family names, and
other questions for a quarter of an
hour before he was convinced that
they had not gone up into Fry's
room to spy down on the practice
field below.
When Kennedy's and Crandall's
innocence was established, appolo
gies were made and the Stanford
labeled car's tires pumped up.
