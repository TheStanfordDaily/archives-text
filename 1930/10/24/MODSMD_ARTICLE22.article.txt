Ready and fit, the Stanford varsity
j will swing into action tomorrow
j against the Terrible Trojans from
| Southern California, underdogs ex-
I cept upon their own campus. It will
i be a team boasting the most versa
tile offense Warner has devised, a
team well qualified to put these
j plays into operation.
For the past week, the Old Fox
j has been busy putting the finishing
| touches upon his handiwork, and to
i morrow like a master craftsman he
! will watch the workings of the ma
j chine he has molded. Much that is
I new, built upon the basic principles
j of the Warner style of play, has
j been perfected during the past few
j days, and a flashing offense will
' greet the Thundering Herd.
Stanford Confident
Like children on the day before
i Christmas, the Stanford student
j body on the day before the game
| waits eagerly for the surprises which
I Warner has prepared for Jones. A
J contagious spirit of confidence pcr
; vades the team, and is reflected in
the feeling deep within the hearts
j of every Redshirt that tomorrow's
i setting sun will find the Cardinal
triumphant.
Meanwhile Jones has not been
idle. In Duffield and Mohler, the
man of Troy has two aces to which
he may draw, and a backfield
rounded out with Musick, Pinckert,
and Apsit, makes it a full house. A
week of intensive drill has sharp
ened the appetites of the Red and
Gold eleven for the taste of Cardinal
I blood.
Warner Satisfied
But Warner has 52 Cards in his
deck, and can deal himself a back
field consisting of Hillman,. Moffat!,
Caglieri, and Rothert. That Pop is
satisfied with his men could be seen
after practice last night, for Warner
was iji good humor.
With 39 men, the coaches, and the
senior football manager, the Card
inal mentor will encamp at the Val
ley Farm until game time, and in the
lair of the Old Fox final plans for
the encounter will be drawn up.
All of the men are fit, and a battle
royal will be the order of the day
tomorrow.
Teams Match
Jones has indicated that he will
bend every effort to worst Warner
for the third successive season, while
Pop has been pointing his men to
ward the clash with Southern Cali
fornia. A battle of brain and brawn
will be waged. Speed for speed, de
ception for deception, power for
power, the men and coaches will
match in this contest.
Should Stanford win, it will be in
a fair way to carry on to Conference
heights. Should Southern California
win, it will find recompense for the
clawing received from the Washing
ton State Cougars. Vicing with the
rivalry of the colleges, the individual
turning in the most scintillating per
formances will find his name placed
high upon the gridiron roll of honor.
Both teams will be glorious in vic
tory or magnificent in defeat, but
I his should be Stanford's year. Twice
in the past the walls of Troy have
repulsed the attacks of the Red
shirts, but as Troy fell before the
onslaught of the Greeks, so we pick
Southern California to fall before
the reverses of Stanford.

the encounter will be drawn up.
All of the men are fit, and a battle
royal will be the order of the day
tomorrow.
Teams Match
Jones has indicated that he will
bend every effort to worst Warner
for the third successive season, while
Pop has been pointing his men to
ward the clash with Southern Cali
fornia. A battle of brain and brawn
will be waged. Speed for speed, de
ception for deception, power for
power, the men and coaches will
match in this contest.
Should Stanford win, it will be in
a fair way to carry on to Conference
heights. Should Southern California
win, it will find recompense for the
clawing received from the Washing
ton State Cougars. Vicing with the
rivalry of the colleges, the individual
turning in the most scintillating per
formances will find his name placed
high upon the gridiron roll of honor.
Both teams will be glorious in vic
tory or magnificent in defeat, but
I his should be Stanford's year. Twice
in the past the walls of Troy have
repulsed the attacks of the Red
shirts, but as Troy fell before the
onslaught of the Greeks, so we pick
Southern California to fall before
the reverses of Stanford.

Ready and fit, the Stanford varsity
j will swing into action tomorrow
j against the Terrible Trojans from
| Southern California, underdogs ex-
I cept upon their own campus. It will
i be a team boasting the most versa
tile offense Warner has devised, a
team well qualified to put these
j plays into operation.
For the past week, the Old Fox
j has been busy putting the finishing
| touches upon his handiwork, and to
i morrow like a master craftsman he
! will watch the workings of the ma
j chine he has molded. Much that is
I new, built upon the basic principles
j of the Warner style of play, has
j been perfected during the past few
j days, and a flashing offense will
' greet the Thundering Herd.
Stanford Confident
Like children on the day before
i Christmas, the Stanford student
j body on the day before the game
| waits eagerly for the surprises which
I Warner has prepared for Jones. A
J contagious spirit of confidence pcr
; vades the team, and is reflected in
the feeling deep within the hearts
j of every Redshirt that tomorrow's
i setting sun will find the Cardinal
triumphant.
Meanwhile Jones has not been
idle. In Duffield and Mohler, the
man of Troy has two aces to which
he may draw, and a backfield
rounded out with Musick, Pinckert,
and Apsit, makes it a full house. A
week of intensive drill has sharp
ened the appetites of the Red and
Gold eleven for the taste of Cardinal
I blood.
Warner Satisfied
But Warner has 52 Cards in his
deck, and can deal himself a back
field consisting of Hillman,. Moffat!,
Caglieri, and Rothert. That Pop is
satisfied with his men could be seen
after practice last night, for Warner
was iji good humor.
With 39 men, the coaches, and the
senior football manager, the Card
inal mentor will encamp at the Val
ley Farm until game time, and in the
lair of the Old Fox final plans for
the encounter will be drawn up.
All of the men are fit, and a battle
