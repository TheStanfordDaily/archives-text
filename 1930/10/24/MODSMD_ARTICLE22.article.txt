Ready and fit, the Stanford varsity
j will swing into action tomorrow
j against the Terrible Trojans from
| Southern California, underdogs ex-
I cept upon their own campus. It will
i be a team boasting the most versa
tile offense Warner has devised, a
team well qualified to put these
j plays into operation.
For the past week, the Old Fox
j has been busy putting the finishing
| touches upon his handiwork, and to
i morrow like a master craftsman he
! will watch the workings of the ma
j chine he has molded. Much that is
I new, built upon the basic principles
j of the Warner style of play, has
j been perfected during the past few
j days, and a flashing offense will
' greet the Thundering Herd.
Stanford Confident
Like children on the day before
i Christmas, the Stanford student
j body on the day before the game
| waits eagerly for the surprises which
I Warner has prepared for Jones. A
J contagious spirit of confidence pcr
; vades the team, and is reflected in
the feeling deep within the hearts
j of every Redshirt that tomorrow's
i setting sun will find the Cardinal
triumphant.
Meanwhile Jones has not been
idle. In Duffield and Mohler, the
man of Troy has two aces to which
he may draw, and a backfield
rounded out with Musick, Pinckert,
and Apsit, makes it a full house. A
week of intensive drill has sharp
ened the appetites of the Red and
Gold eleven for the taste of Cardinal
I blood.
Warner Satisfied
But Warner has 52 Cards in his
deck, and can deal himself a back
field consisting of Hillman,. Moffat!,
Caglieri, and Rothert. That Pop is
satisfied with his men could be seen
