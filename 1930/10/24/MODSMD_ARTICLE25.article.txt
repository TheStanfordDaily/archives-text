# A
						NEW LEADER FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
The Stanford Hoard of Trustees yesterday granted the applica
tion hi I )r. Ray Lyman Wilbur for a year's leave of absence from
11 if I'niversity; it was granted without the salary of $22,000 which
lie lias been receiving heretofore while acting as secretary of interior
in President I loover's cabinet.
I'esides this, the board appointed I )r. Robert Kckles Swain "as
active executive head of the I'niversity, to assume and cxcrcisc all
llit* functions and responsibilities of the presidency. "
This action of the trustees is to be interpreted as meaning that
Dr. W ilbur is now president of Stanford in name only ; and that
I )r. Swain is now in supreme charge of all major and minor policies
of the I'niversity.
It is interpreted as meaning that no longer will the minutes of
1 lie Hoard of Athletic Control be sent to Washington, D.C., to be
approved by Dr. Wilbur before any action can be taken: it means
that the future of the (Jraduate School of I'usiness and other recently
established graduate schools lies in the hands of Dr. Swain ; it means
1 hat the responsibility of obtaining additional endowments for the
I 'niversity rests with the acting-president.
In other words the trustees' action is interpreted to mean that the
administration of Stanford will no longer he accomplished by means
of the long-distance telephone.
The board's decision fully sustains The DAILY'S stand
of two weeks ago that control of this institution should be
placed in the hands of an executive on the campus and further
clarifies the trustees' appointment of Dr. Swain as acting
president with full power. The trustees apparently realized
that Stanford was not capable of being governed from a point
some three thousand miles from here.
And to add another interpretation to the trustees' action it is
interesting to find that Dr. Swain is expected to "assume and ex
ercise" the functions of the presidency. The task now remains for
I )r. Swain to fully exercise his authority.
