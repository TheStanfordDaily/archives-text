# NO PLACE FOR CAMPAIGNS
## 
### 
Stanford is singularly blessed with a marked absence of cheap
campus politicians, blatant campaigning, and rowdy electioneering.
Student opinion has consistently frowned on any but dignified and
sober elections.
The political activity on the part of freshmen preceding last
night's Encina Club balloting is a regrettable carry-over from high
school days. Campaign signs were conspicuously posted throughout
the dormitory, while self-styled bosses busied themselves in "lining
up" the voters.
Nominations for freshman class offices will take place in a few
days. Regardless of previous practice, men and women of 1934
should know that there is no place at Stanford for political speeches,
rallies, posters, and vote trading.
Choosing leaders is a serious business which should not he hin
dered or influenced by cheap political methods.
