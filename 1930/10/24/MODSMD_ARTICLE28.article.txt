# "MRS. BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH"

### 
I hough best known for achievements in academic lines, on the '
football gridiron, and on the track oval, Stanford has also a repu
tation for excellence on the stage. Through the presentation of con- 1
sistently worthwhile performances in recent years, first under the
direction of Cordon Davis and now under Harold I lelvenston, the
I Diversity has gained wide recognition for the quality of its dra- .
matics.
The 1 *>30â€”31 campus season will be opened tonight with the
presentation of "Mrs. Ilumpstead-l.eigh" in the Assembly I fall. An
experienced cast, artistic sets by Frederic Stover, and I lelvenston's I
able direction seem more than enough to assure Stanford of another
stage success.
