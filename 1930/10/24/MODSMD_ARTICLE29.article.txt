THE CONQUEST OF HAPPINESS.
By Bertram! Russell. Horace,
Liveright, Inc. New York, 1930
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Food, shelter, health, love, suc
cessful work, and the respect of
one's own herd—these are the few
and relatively simple ingredients of
Bertram! Russell's recipe for happi
l ness, as set forth in this, his latest
112
volume, "The Conquest of Happi
ness."
With clear and intelligent logic,
and in a style that is very readable,
Russell traces the path to a joyful
! existence which men have made so
i difficult to lind.
Russell sees clearly the enormous
number of unhappy people, and sees
also what trivial things usually
cause their sadness. The advice in
his book will undoubtedly prove
very helpful to those who need and
accept it. —J. McG.
THE FOOL OF THE FAMILY, Mar
garet Kennedy; Douhleday Do
ran, (At the Palo Alio
Book Store.)
Caryl Sanger was a musician
without the fire of self-confident
independence necessary to make a
great musician. Thus he called him
self a fool, and let his "apple-carts"
be upset by his brilliant brother. In
the end, that same brother who has
almost naively stolen the love of
Caryl's fiance, turns to him for help.
And Caryl, because he loves his
reckless family, and because he
knows that only through his help
I can a masterpiece of musical compo
sition be given to the world, sacri
fices his pride, and finds—happiness.

The Caryl of Margaret Kennedy's
! "Constant Nymph" was a steady,
responsible boy, whose interesting
1 character was lost in the more star
-1 tling actions of his younger broth
i ers and sisters. The older Caryl,
while still feeling responsible for
those who bear his father's name,
has a fineness of character slightly
dulled by his pessimistic attitude
toward his own future, and his pas
sive acceptance of "apple-cart up
sets" which the reader feels he could
have avoided, or at least remedied.
"The Fool of the Family" does not
reach the standard set by the "Con
stant Nymph." Its plot is well han
dled to reach a convincing enough
situation, but one doubts whether
Margaret Kennedy realized that
"Sanger's circus" had grown up dur
ing the interval between her novels
in any way other than age. —J.N.
MADAM SATAN—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
At the height of a mask ball in a
giant Zeppelin, where Madam Satan
has won the plaudits of the crowd,
comes a storm which tears the ship
from its mast. With a great deal of
excitement the guests and crew es
cape, all with parachutes but one.
In doing so, they turn what ap
peared to be tragedy into good
comedy.
Plot and acting are subordinate to
the amazing originality of dancing,
scenery, and general entertainment.
Roland Young and Reginald Denny
give good performances, assisted by
Kay Johnston and Lillian Roth.
The singing is not so good, but as
a whole, "Madam Satan" is an in
teresting picture with plenty of
really amusing situations. —J. N.
