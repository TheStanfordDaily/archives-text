# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Hour after hour, the campus is ,
becoming more cluttered up with I
visitors who think Stanford is one
sa-well place, when a good game is ;
scheduled. S'pose we ought to be
grateful for anything that keeps
business-men grads smiling over
their breakfast coffee. Now for a
good score
We have to blame the visitors
for all the extra noise of vacuum
cleaners and rug-beatings, lip
on the Row. An alarm was sent
in for a fire or riot, yesterday
afternoon, but when the police
appeared, they discovered that
the Kappa Sigs were simply
cleaning house.
More platitudinous yet—"May the
best team win!—And we're awfully
sorry for you, S.C. We know you ,
tried hard anough . . ."
One thing we do hope is that the •
enemy has a better band than ours 1
—and that they've learned to play
something besides "Fight On!" since
last year.
Seriously, our band is getting
almost as bad as the CJlec Club.
Every time they play an im
pressive opening chord, we think

we're going to hear an honest
to-gosh Stanford song, at last.
Then it turns out to be a snappy
piccolo solo, from a dance num
ber popular when the first two
of our famous three alums were
making Encina history.
The Glee Club's selections are
at least uplifting, with semi
hymns. and close closet har
mony. The band has only uni
forms to save it.
Like all good Greek or Indian
warriors, we're strong believers in
cause and effect. There must be a
Helen lurking among us, or Troy
wouldn't be so interested.
There's a project for the Boy
Scouts among us—to find the
missing Helen, and keep track
of her till the game is over.
Or, whoever you are, Helen, will
you please step forward and let us
see what it is that keeps Los An
geles interested? Maybe it's just
that we haven't used our eyes, but
really where is she?

One thing we do hope is that the •
enemy has a better band than ours 1
—and that they've learned to play
something besides "Fight On!" since
last year.
Seriously, our band is getting
almost as bad as the CJlec Club.
Every time they play an im
pressive opening chord, we think

we're going to hear an honest
to-gosh Stanford song, at last.
Then it turns out to be a snappy
piccolo solo, from a dance num
ber popular when the first two
of our famous three alums were
making Encina history.
The Glee Club's selections are
at least uplifting, with semi
hymns. and close closet har
mony. The band has only uni
forms to save it.
Like all good Greek or Indian
warriors, we're strong believers in
cause and effect. There must be a
Helen lurking among us, or Troy
wouldn't be so interested.
There's a project for the Boy
Scouts among us—to find the
missing Helen, and keep track
of her till the game is over.
Or, whoever you are, Helen, will
you please step forward and let us
see what it is that keeps Los An
geles interested? Maybe it's just
that we haven't used our eyes, but
really where is she?
Hour after hour, the campus is ,
becoming more cluttered up with I
visitors who think Stanford is one
sa-well place, when a good game is ;
scheduled. S'pose we ought to be
grateful for anything that keeps
business-men grads smiling over
their breakfast coffee. Now for a
good score
We have to blame the visitors
for all the extra noise of vacuum
cleaners and rug-beatings, lip
on the Row. An alarm was sent
in for a fire or riot, yesterday
afternoon, but when the police
appeared, they discovered that
the Kappa Sigs were simply
cleaning house.
More platitudinous yet—"May the
best team win!—And we're awfully
sorry for you, S.C. We know you ,
tried hard anough . . ."
