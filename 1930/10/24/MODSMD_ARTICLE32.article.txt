De Pauw University has adopted
a marching glee club instead of a
band. While it is true that a glee
club cannot sport tall drum majors,
it is also equally true it is not so
likely to present, "The Stars and
Stripes Forever" —which is quite an
asset.
Undaunted l>> the refusal of Harv
and to let him use its songs, Rudy
Vallee lias "fought on"; and has now
gone "interntional." He will soon
broadcast songs of the University of
Toronto (Canada).
Perhaps now it will be the "Tea
Song."
Senator Borah, alleged friend of
Alice Roosevelt Longworth, spoke
at the University of Idaho. The col
lege band played, "Here We Have
Idaho"—and that's just about cor
rect with Borah on the platform.
The Dean of Freshmen at the Uni
versity of Illinois advises frosh to
forget their high school necking
practices.
The dean is absolutely right. When
in Rome, do as the Romans; when in
Chicago, DUCK; and when at col
lege, neck as college students neck.
A professor at the University of
Colorado makes the statement that
women take more courses of no im
portance than do men.
That all depends on the meaning
of the word—importance.
And that also implys that some
courses in college are not important.
This is a dangerous admission for a
professor to make for if one pro
fessor admits one course is of no
importance, then all professors may
admit that all courses are of no im
portance; and that would leave
higher education not so very high.
A campaign is being waged at the
University of .Michigan to stop pro
fessors from using their own texts.
We see no danger in permitting a
professor to expand when he can
say, "As I Say In My Text." What
we do object to are the periodical
new editions of dry text books. But
of course we realize that subjects
are always changing.
Yet it seems as if Richard T. Ely
puts out a new edition of his "Out
lines of Economics" every time the
cost of living goes lip or the stock
market comes down.

puts out a new edition of his "Out
lines of Economics" every time the
cost of living goes lip or the stock
market comes down.
De Pauw University has adopted
a marching glee club instead of a
band. While it is true that a glee
club cannot sport tall drum majors,
it is also equally true it is not so
likely to present, "The Stars and
Stripes Forever" —which is quite an

The Dean of Freshmen at the Uni
versity of Illinois advises frosh to

admit that all courses are of no im
portance; and that would leave
higher education not so very high.
A campaign is being waged at the

say, "As I Say In My Text." What
we do object to are the periodical
new editions of dry text books. But
of course we realize that subjects
are always changing.
