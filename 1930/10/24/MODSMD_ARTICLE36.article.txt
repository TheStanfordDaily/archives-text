## WHO'S RIDICULING? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May 1 ask why the Daily should
ridicule in its editorial column Wil
liam Plymat because of his con
nection with the "Student Sobriety !
Society?" The society is compara
tively new; so what right has the
Daily to decide whether it is ridicu
lous or not, especially when it has
to get so personal about an indi
vidual student.
Yours truly,
FRANKLIN BAKER.
