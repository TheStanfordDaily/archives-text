Sir:
Permit us a gripe. Last Friday
evening it seems that several score
of our best friends united in remov
ing all necessary and unnecessary
furniture from our room and replac- !
ing it with several bales of hay and
a very friendly but extremely nerv
ous bovine (cow). Now, here is the
gripe—first the Dippy informs the
general public that said incident oc
curred in room 10G. and that the cow :
mooed while in the room. Is Zat So? .
Then by the present edition of the j
Call-Bulletin we note again how
they garble the detail, by changing

the sex of the animal, inserting a
red night-shirt and the campus cop,
and stating that an investigation was
now under way. May we slate that
no investigation is necessary we al
ready know.
Let us hope that in the interest
of facts the Dippy will be more spe
cific in its future articles on animal
husbandry.
