to aerial acrobatics next Sunday
when it plays at the dedication
ceremony of Campus Field, local
airport. Besides the band concert,
which starts at 2:30 o'clock, the pro
gram includes a series of air races
and stunts lasting from 9 o'clock in
the morning until 5 o'clock in the
evening.
Among the visiting planes ex
pected for the air carnival, spon
sored by Post 375 of the American
Legion, are 15 army ships from
southern California and a tri-mo

numbers of planes, as in previous
years, are not to be accommodated
for the U.S.C. game, according to
Paul Mantz, chief pilot of the Palo
Alto School of Aviation, but a large
group of ships is expected for the
dedication.
Events on the program include
parachute jumps, dead-stick land
ing, glider exhibitions, balloon
"busting" in the air, and various
exhibition flights. The show is open
to the public without charge, ac
cording to Mantz. Capt. "Bill" Royle
will be master of ceremonies
