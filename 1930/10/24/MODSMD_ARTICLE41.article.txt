# CONVERSION POINT AFTER TOUCHDOWN REMAINS S.C. JINX
## Washington State, Notre Dame, Stanford Have Proved Hoodoo 
### 
Because Orv Mohler juggled a
pass fnmi center and didn't even
give Johnny Baker a chance to boot
the ball for the extra point after
touchdown, a tragic U.S.C. eleven
had to return from their game with
Washington State this year to admit
lhat once a;:;ain the inevitable one
point had cost them an important
grid contest.
The extfa point jinx has probably
cost the Trojans more major con
tests than any other one factor. It
cost them a victory over Stanford
in 192G, and converted a sure win
into a tie in 1927. Last year the
Howard Jones clan dropped a 13 to
12 decision, to Notre Dame, and the
same curse has followed them in
other close battles.
In 1926 an underdog Cardinal
eleven snatched av/ay a 13 to 12
victory because twice Laraneta
failed to add the point after touch
down.
In 1927 the Howard Jones clan
led, 13 to 7, near the end of the
game, but a last-minute touchdown
tied the contest for the Cards, and
a conversion would have meant the
difference between victory and a
tie.
Goal-kicking picked up at the
Southern institution in the next two
years, but as Stanford didn't score
in either game, the added points
weren't of great value.
It began to look as if the days of
one-point losses were gone forever,
but. the old jinx reappeared against
Notre Dame last year and Wash
ington State this season. What fate
holds in store for the Trojans this
year will be revealed tomorrow.
Perhaps that one-point markin may
again prevail.
