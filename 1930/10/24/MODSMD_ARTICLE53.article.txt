## Victim Smiles At Penalty Imposed For "Law Step" Violation 
### 
BOULDER, Colo., Oct. 23. t/P)â€”
The sentencing of a University of
Colorado girl to a ducking in the
icy waters of Varsity Lake has
stirred warfare between law and
engineering students.
The girl, Virginia Tasher of Den
ver, was sentenced to the cold bath
because she walked up the front
steps of the Guggenheim Law Build
ing, a privilege reserved by school
tradition for law students only. She
took her punishment with a smile
and declared it was "great 1 un."
She was the first girl in the his
tory of the university to undergo
the sentence which is the most se
vere discipline meted out to under
classmen.
Engineering students sent out an
ultimatum against a repetition of
the occurrence and threatened
physical violence upon the law stu
dents if it did occur again.
