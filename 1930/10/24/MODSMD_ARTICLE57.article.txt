## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 23 (^P). â€”Science,
| after all, should get the feminine
vote, thinks N.A. Oatridge, Cam
bridge University debater.
Meeting the representatives of the
University of Chicago in debate last |
' night, he heard them charge that
science had destroyed individualism -j
' and had put a lot of men out of .
; jobs.
"But," interposed the Cambridge j
| scholar, "science has fixed it so that j
a lot of women are now getting two j
glances from men where before they ;
never got one. Take face lifting, take j
the permanent wave, take scientific j
complexions. That's science. It's j
! made the world more beautiful."
Which, the audience agreed, at !
least put the subject in a new light. !
