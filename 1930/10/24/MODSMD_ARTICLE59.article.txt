# IMPROVED OUTLOOK ON BUSINESS GIVEN IN ANNUAL REPORT
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 23 (/P).—A series
of items of business optimism sang
across the wires of the nation today
—the first anniversary of the stock
market crash.
They told of several thousand men
being called back to full-time jobs,
of plants preparing to resume nor
mal operations and, in one instance
of an increase in wage.
President Hoover's committee on
unemployment began functioning at
Washington, and municipal agencies
made definite movements for the
relief of local conditions.
None would minimize the serious
ness of the present situation, but
there was an undercurrent of in
creasing optimism in the day's news.
