# Man-For-Man Ability Of Rival Teams Doped As Toss-Up
## CARDS HAVE EDGE IN FORWARD LINE; TROY BACKS GOOD Analysis of Little Value; Dope of Interest To Grid Fans 
### R.J. F 
In these days of high-powered
sports analysis, the man-for-man
comparison has come to be re
garded as an essential feature of
pre-game dope, not because of its
value, which is approximately three
times lighter than a straw hat, but
because it generally makes good
reading.
The fact that the men compared
do not play opposite each other in
the contest does ,not detract from
its merit as a column-filler. Hence,
without any misgivings, we offer
this man-for-man size-up of the
Stanford and Southern California
elevens.
The Ends
Some 88,000 spectators will be
privileged to see the Coast's two
premier wingmen in action. If there
arc any ends better than Phil Neill
of Stanford or Garrett Arbelbide of
U.S.C. cavorting this season, they
have not received their due. Give
Neill the edge.
Ralph Wilcox, the other Trojan
end, has nothing but experience to
warrant his being given the edge
over Bill Doub of the Cardinals,
whose sole weakness is inexperience.
Call it a toss-up because of Doub's
greater potentialities.
The Tackles
The comparison of Bob Hall and
Captain Ray Tandy of Stanford
takes much the same direction as
the Arbelbide-Neill argument.
Tandy will not smear as many plays
for losses as Hall will, but the yard
age made over and around him can
be discounted as negligible. Like
Arbelbide, Hall can be fooled.
If Tandy's injured knee prevents
his playing, Chuck Ehrhorn will
hold down the post, and probably
make it hot for the Trojan punters,
but he will lack Ray's steadiness.
A slight advantage to Stanford if
Tandy plays; a more decided one
to Troy if he does not.
At the other side, Dick Bogue has
too much all-round class for Tay
Brown, the only sophomore in the
Jones first-string lineup. If Dick
ever gets really angry, the famous
U.S.C. cutback will be a liability.
The Guards
Here U.S.C. has a clear-cut mar
gin of superiority. Johnny Baker,
running guard and key man of the
Southerners' offense, is a copper
plated wizard at'his position, and he
should be the best guard on the
field. Jess Shaw, on the other side
of the Trojan center, is a three-year
veteran. Milt Hand. Bill Hardin,
and Pete Heiser will all start the
game with some kind of injury that
may handicap their effectiveness.
The Centers
There are better centers on the
Coast than Perry Taylor of Stan
ford and Stan Williamson, but there
are no harder fighters. Williamson
is addicted to erratic passing. Call
it a toss-up.
The Quarterbacks
Although Phil Moffatt is listed as
a left halfback, he and Marshall
Duffield, (he Trojan quarter, per
form nearly the same duties. As
triple-threaters, they leave nothing
to be desired. Both can pass and
kick, and their ball-carrying abili
ties are well known. Duffield leans
more to the smashing type of run
ning; Moffatt is of the elusive type.
At safety, the Stanford has a slight
edge, but the Santa Monica blond
is nobody's set-up. In reserve, the
Trojans hold Orville Mohler, their
latest ''greater than."
The Halfbacks
This finds us comparing Harlow
Rothert and Ernie Pinckert. Rothert
is another triple-threater, the best
punter on either team, and a hard
running ball-packer. Pinckert con
fines his activities to blocking, where
he is a marvel. Defensively, Ernie
has the edge, but Rothert is the
greater offensive threat.
Like Pinckert, Marger Apsit, the
Trojan left half, is used principally
for blocking and interference, which
makes a comparison with Guido
Caglicri a trifle difficult. Apsit is
a deadly pass-receiver; Caglieri a
driving type of runner who carries
tacklers with him when he hits.
Apsit is steadier on defense.
The Fullbacks
Jim Musick and Harry Hillman
offer a fine comparison, both being
invaluable as line-smashers. Hill
man hits a line harder than any
fullback on the coast, but he does
not hold his feet as Musick does.
The latter is faster than Harry, but
Hillman can back up a line in great
fashion. A slight edge to Musick.
