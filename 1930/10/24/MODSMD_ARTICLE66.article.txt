# CARDS SHOW LACK OF SCORING FINCH IN TOUGHER EARLY SEASON CONTESTS
## 
### 
Coach Pop Warner's 1930 model
| varsity inaugurated the season on
! September 20 with a one-sided vic
! Tory over the West Coast Army
I eleven in the Stanford stadium. The
! final score was 32 to 0, and prac
; tically every Redshirt saw action.
On the following Saturday Stan
| ford was faced with a more formid-
I able opponent in the annual clash
| with the Olympic Club. The Cards
; looked strong in occasional flashes,
I winning 18 to 0. The seconds out
| gained the Clubmen but were un
! able to score during two quarters.
! Near the end of the second period
I Warner injected the regular back
| field into the contest. With Moffatt,
; Hillman, and Rothert packing the
j ball, a touchdown was shoved over
! the Winged "O" goal before the end
| of the half. Two more Stanford
j scores were made in the last quarter
i as the result of a blocked punt and
an intercepted pass, both within
Olympic Club territory.
Cards Facc Broncos
Out to avenge the defeat of 192 D,
the Big Ked Machine took the field
j against Santa Clara on October 4.
Facing a fighting team of Broncos,
the Cards played alternately flashy
and erratic football to grab the en
counter by a 20 to 0 count.
After a scoreless first half, MoP'att
caught a Bronco punt and romped
45 yards to a touchdown. A few
minutes later he tossed a pass to
Rothert, who gathered in the 25-
' yard toss and ran 40 yards to the
Santa Clara goal line. The third
touchdown came in the last quar
ter, when Rothert intercepted a pass
and ran the ball back for a score.
Gophers Troublesome
Doped to defeat the Minnesota
Gophers by a large score in Minne
apolis October 1!, the Warnermen
found themselves pitted against an
outfit which showed unexpected de
fensive power. The Cardinal attack
functioned well in midfield, but fre- ;
quent fumbles and (he dogged de- \
termination with which Minnesota ;
defended its goal kept Stanford from
scoring throughout the game.
The Gophers, although trouble
some, were never dangerous during
the contest, which ended in a score
less tie. Stanford retired from the
game with her goal still uncrossed
this season, but the offensive drive i
of ihe Cardinals looked less effective '
against Minnesota than in any pre
vious game.
Beavers Tough
Returning to the Pacific Coast,, the
Redshirts faced Oregon State last
Saturday in the first Conference
game on the Cardinal schedule.
Stanford again was doped to win,
and did, but only after an exciting
and hard-fought second half, which
ended 13 to 7. As in the earlier
Rame with the Olympic Club, the ;

I second string gained a small ad
i vantage over the Beavers for almost
! two quarters, and was then replaced
by the regulars. With five minutes
:to play, Hillman, Caglieri, Rothert,
I and Moffatt advanced the ball to
I within striking distance of the
' Orange goal, from where Moffat
scored on a reverse and lateral play.
' Again befoi-e the end of the half the
j Cards scored, when Caglieri inter
-1 cepted a pass on the O.S.C. 23-yard
| line and Koihert shot a long pass to
i Moffatt, who ambled over the Bea
j ver line.
In the second half Stanford
! seemed to have lost its offensive
; power. The Beavers opened up with
j a passing attack which netted them
one touchdown and threatened the
j Stanford go; Ion several other occa-
I sions. During the closing few min
; utes of play the Cardinals once more
| showed an inspired brand of foot
ball, this time in defending their
; goal from varied and accurate Ore
i gon State passes.

Cards Facc Broncos
Out to avenge the defeat of 192 D,
the Big Ked Machine took the field
j against Santa Clara on October 4.
Facing a fighting team of Broncos,
the Cards played alternately flashy
and erratic football to grab the en
counter by a 20 to 0 count.
After a scoreless first half, MoP'att
caught a Bronco punt and romped
45 yards to a touchdown. A few
minutes later he tossed a pass to
Rothert, who gathered in the 25-
' yard toss and ran 40 yards to the
Santa Clara goal line. The third
touchdown came in the last quar
ter, when Rothert intercepted a pass
and ran the ball back for a score.
Gophers Troublesome
Doped to defeat the Minnesota
Gophers by a large score in Minne
apolis October 1!, the Warnermen
found themselves pitted against an
outfit which showed unexpected de
fensive power. The Cardinal attack
functioned well in midfield, but fre- ;
quent fumbles and (he dogged de- \
termination with which Minnesota ;
defended its goal kept Stanford from
scoring throughout the game.
The Gophers, although trouble
some, were never dangerous during
the contest, which ended in a score
less tie. Stanford retired from the
game with her goal still uncrossed
this season, but the offensive drive i
of ihe Cardinals looked less effective '
against Minnesota than in any pre
vious game.
Beavers Tough
Returning to the Pacific Coast,, the
Redshirts faced Oregon State last
Saturday in the first Conference
game on the Cardinal schedule.
Stanford again was doped to win,
and did, but only after an exciting
and hard-fought second half, which
ended 13 to 7. As in the earlier
Rame with the Olympic Club, the ;

I second string gained a small ad
i vantage over the Beavers for almost
! two quarters, and was then replaced
by the regulars. With five minutes
:to play, Hillman, Caglieri, Rothert,
I and Moffatt advanced the ball to
I within striking distance of the
' Orange goal, from where Moffat
scored on a reverse and lateral play.
' Again befoi-e the end of the half the
j Cards scored, when Caglieri inter
-1 cepted a pass on the O.S.C. 23-yard
| line and Koihert shot a long pass to
i Moffatt, who ambled over the Bea
j ver line.
In the second half Stanford
! seemed to have lost its offensive
; power. The Beavers opened up with
j a passing attack which netted them
one touchdown and threatened the
j Stanford go; Ion several other occa-
I sions. During the closing few min

and erratic football to grab the en
counter by a 20 to 0 count.
After a scoreless first half, MoP'att
caught a Bronco punt and romped
45 yards to a touchdown. A few
minutes later he tossed a pass to
Rothert, who gathered in the 25-
' yard toss and ran 40 yards to the
Santa Clara goal line. The third
touchdown came in the last quar
ter, when Rothert intercepted a pass
and ran the ball back for a score.
Gophers Troublesome
Doped to defeat the Minnesota
Gophers by a large score in Minne
apolis October 1!, the Warnermen
found themselves pitted against an
outfit which showed unexpected de
fensive power. The Cardinal attack
functioned well in midfield, but fre- ;
quent fumbles and (he dogged de- \
termination with which Minnesota ;
defended its goal kept Stanford from
scoring throughout the game.
The Gophers, although trouble
some, were never dangerous during
the contest, which ended in a score
less tie. Stanford retired from the
game with her goal still uncrossed
this season, but the offensive drive i
of ihe Cardinals looked less effective '
against Minnesota than in any pre
vious game.
Beavers Tough
Returning to the Pacific Coast,, the
Redshirts faced Oregon State last
Saturday in the first Conference
game on the Cardinal schedule.
Stanford again was doped to win,
and did, but only after an exciting
and hard-fought second half, which
ended 13 to 7. As in the earlier
Rame with the Olympic Club, the ;

I second string gained a small ad
i vantage over the Beavers for almost
! two quarters, and was then replaced
by the regulars. With five minutes
:to play, Hillman, Caglieri, Rothert,
I and Moffatt advanced the ball to
I within striking distance of the
' Orange goal, from where Moffat
scored on a reverse and lateral play.
' Again befoi-e the end of the half the
j Cards scored, when Caglieri inter
-1 cepted a pass on the O.S.C. 23-yard
| line and Koihert shot a long pass to
i Moffatt, who ambled over the Bea
j ver line.
In the second half Stanford
! seemed to have lost its offensive
; power. The Beavers opened up with
j a passing attack which netted them
one touchdown and threatened the
j Stanford go; Ion several other occa-
I sions. During the closing few min
; utes of play the Cardinals once more
| showed an inspired brand of foot
ball, this time in defending their
; goal from varied and accurate Ore
i gon State passes.
