# WARNER-JONES VERBAL DUEL ADDS INTEREST TO STANFORD-TROY TILT
## 
### 
j Trojan and Cardinal will meet for
' the tenth time tomorrow in gridiron
i combat, and the spirit engendered
1 by long rivalry will be much in evi
i dence, but to the traditional interest
j in competition between tv/o power
! ful teams there will be added to-
I morrow interest in the "rubber"
| game between the two great coaches
who have clashed with each other
[ in hard-fought contests both verb
j ally and on the gridiron in recent
j years.
Football records show that How
ard Jones of U.S.C. and Glenn Sco
j bey Warner of Stanford are even so
! far as Pacific Coast competition goes,
! each having won two games from
his opponent, with one tie.
How the verbal competition stands,
! nobody knows. It began last fall
when Pittsburgh came out to play
U.S.C. in the annual New Year's
' Day game in the Pasadena Rose
! Bowl, when Warner went down to
' the station to meet the invading
team.
This struck Howard Jones eta be
! ing not so good, and he proceeded
!to say so, declaring that Pop was
giving aid and comfort to the enemy,
| an Eastern team, instead of standing
I solidly behind the Pacific Coast
j eleven.

Warner is alleged to have denied
the charge of aiding the Pitt men
and to have countered with a few
remarks about the way in which the
Trojans failed to stop a full second
on their shift. This, of course, didn't
make Howard any happier, but the
football season was over by then,
so the public controversy died out.
It was revived again a few weeks
ago when Jones took to making re
marks over the radio about Warner
and his teams. Warner was alleged
to have said that Jones was not
sporty and that he coached his
teams not to stop the full second on
the shift, so Howard came back with
a crack about being willing to match
his record for sportsmanship against
any that Pop had made, and flatly
denied coaching his men to beat the
shift rule.
Warner apparently decided that
things had gone far enough. He is
sued an official statement saying that
he had the highest personal regai'd
for Howard Jones, that he didn't
say Jones was not sporty, and that
he didn't say Jones coached his men
to play illegally, but that they actu
ally did shift too soon.
Hearing this, Coach Jones issued
a similar statement expressing great
esteem for his rival. And there the
matter rests.
