# STANFORD TO HAVE LARGE SECTION OF ROOTERS FOR GAME
## 
### 
"Stanford will sport the largest
i rooting section in the history of
! Stanford-U.S.C. football games,"
; said Jake Irwin, head of the ticket
| department of the Board of Athletic
I Control, yesterday.
Over 2,400 men and women will
; make up the rooting section which
j will he ten rows higher than the
rooting section of last year, Irwin
i stated.
Approximately 1,000 tickets are
| still unsold. The unexpected in
! crease in supply, ho said, is due to
the tact that U.S.C. has returned
; about 600 tickets.
University of Southern Califor
nia's original allottment of 23,000
tickets has been sold out for over
a week, while Stanford's allottment
is fast disappearing. The Southern
! California rooters and alumni will
I be located in sections C to F and
G to J. The remaining 65,000 seats
i have been distributed to Stanford
! students, alumni, and the general
1 public.
Reports from the Southern Pacific
ticket agency in Los Angeles indi
j cates that the largest migration in
history from Los Angeles to Palo
Alto will take place over the week
! end via chair car and Pullman.
