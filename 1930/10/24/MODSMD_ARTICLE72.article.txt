# TROJAN RECORD DEMONSTRATES POWER; W.S.C. ROUTS CONFERENCE TITLE HOPES
## 
### 
Starting the season with a wealth,
of material from the 1929 varsity and
! freshman teams, Coach Howard;
Jones' Southern California Trojans
i trampled the U.C.L.A. Bruins under- ,
j foot to win by a score of 52 to 0,
j in their first game.
With Duffield, Musick, and Mohler
doing most of the ball packing, the
S.C. backfield looked like the fa
miliar Thundering Herd of former
years in the U.C.L.A. game. Al
| though the contest was principally
: one long drive toward the Westwood j
goal for the Sons of Troy, the line j
! showed up well on defensive play.
Down Oregon State
On the following Saturday, Oc
tober 4, the Trojans ascended the
second rung in their gridiron ladder
by handing out a 27 to 7 defeat to
a scrappy Oregon State eleven. The
line proved its defensive power by
holding the Beavers for four downs
i after the Oregon Staters had ad
f vanced the ball to the S.C. 4-yard
, line. Mohler, Pinckert, Duffield, '
Brown, and Musick turned in par- !
i ticularly good performances at of- !
' fensive play.
W.S.C. Upsets Troy
Then came the upset. Washington j
I State's Cougars were the bulwark j
upon which Troy's hopes for Pa- :
! cific Coast Conference honors were !

dashed on October 11. The Trojans !
went to Pullman primed for a hard :
game against the powerful W.S.C. j
team, but not for the vicious attack :
which Coach Babe Hollingsberry 1
turned loose that day. The score !
was 7 to 6. The S.C. varsity looked j
like a Thundering Herd only dur- |
ing the closing few minutes of play, i
after it was too late to overcome the j
small lead held by the Cougars. j
Back in Los Angeles again and j
stinging from the unexpected defeat j
by Washington State, Coach Jones j
set about developing greater of- |
fensive and defensive power within !
the Red and Gold varsity, devising i
new tricks to flash before the eyes i
of Pop Warner in the game with i
Stanford at Palo Alto.
Meanwhile, last Saturday the!
Jones men wrought their merciless !
vengeance upon a game but out- j
classed eleven representing the Utah '
Agricultural College. The Trojan j
backfield looked strong again, piling j
up a final count of 65 to 0, but the !

I contest was a failure in some re
i spects. The opposition offered by the
I Aggies was so weak that the gam<
j proved a pushover, instead of the
I good workout Jones had desired ir
i preparation for the Stanford clash.
