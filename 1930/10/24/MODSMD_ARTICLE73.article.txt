# TROJANS WORKED HARD TO PREPARE FOR GRID CLASSIC
## Jones Perfecting Defense Against "C" Formation; Has Aerial Attack

(Daily Trojan Sports Editor)
Shrouded in secrecy behind the
closely guarded walls of Bovard
Field, Coach Howard Jones has
drilled his Thundering Herd for the
widely heralded struggle of the
gridiron Saturday afternoon in the
Stanford Stadium when Southern
California's eleven marches forth 011
the Cardinal field to match wits with
Glen Scobey Warner's always dan
gerous Redshirts.
So far during the coaches' respec
tive careers at the two institutions,
each has emerged the victor twice,
the odd game of an uninterrupted
series ending in a deadlock. The
best trick in Saturday's contest will
make one or the other one up.
Howard Jones has been doing a
great deal of shuffling of late,
changing his first-string eleven al
most nightly. It is almost an im
possibility, rather than a matter of
conjecture, to know who will start
for the Trojans in the bi'g game.
Behind the walls, where only a cer
tain few are admitted, tricks that
Jones intends to make requiring
the best combinations in the deck
are being planned.
Stanford may look for a diversi
fied form of attack built around in
tricate plays and a well-formulated
aerial offense. At the same time a
defense against the famous Warner
formation "C" is being perfected.
Last year the Trojans managed to
stop, at least partially, the Warner
"B" formation.
Several things are certain about
Saturday's game. Two of the great
est coaches in the nation will send
two of the strongest elevens against
each other to begin one of the
greatest games of the 1930 season
before a capacity crowd. The win
ner of the game will have fought
for a superior and deserved recogni
tion.
