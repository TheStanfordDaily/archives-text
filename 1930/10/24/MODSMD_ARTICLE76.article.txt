# 20 MEN COMPETING IN ONE-WALL HAND-BALL TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
The intramural one-wall handball
tournament is under way with about
20 men competing. It will require
about five weeks to run off the
matches.
Incentive is provided for handball
enthusiasts this year in the possi
bility of earning a minor sports let
ter. Last year no award was given,
but the stipulation that an award
be given has been placed in the
constitution since then. The possi
bility of an award in the sport has
developed considerable enthusiasm,
according to Coach Sprague.
While little can be learned of a
player's ability on the four-wall
courts in this one-wall tournament,
the men are working out in order
to get in form for the winter quar
ter matches.
The competitive team which will

represent the University will be se
lected in the all-University four
wall matches in winter quarter.
Men who played against California
last year and letter men are not
eligible for the intramural matches
but will be eligible for all-University
matches.
