# Frosh Meet Gaels In Preliminary Grid Contest
## SAINTS HAVE EDGE OVER BRADSHAW'S YEARLING GRIDMEN Saint Mary's Babes Have Had Comparatively Easy Season 
### Stewart Crawford 
When Coach Jimmy "Rabbit" j
Bradshaw's yearling gridmen trot j
onto the Stadium turf at 11:30
o'clock Saturday to meet the outfit ;
of ex prep school stars which repre- '
sent Saint Mary's, fans who have J
come early to avoid the rush for j
the varsity contest will no doubt be
treated to a hard-fought., even
steven babe tussle.
Both teams will be entering the ;
fray undefeated, though the Cards !
have a tie chalked up against them
by the Sacramento J.C. eleven.
Gaels Have Edge
Two factors give the Moraga i
youngsters a slight edge. In the first :
place, they have played no games
that have been very tough, and !
therefore have not been hit by in- j
juries. The victories so far recorded !
by the Gaels have all been by wide j
margins. With ease they took the 1
Marni J.C. eleven. Saint Ignatius, i
and the San Francisco Eagles.
In downing the California fresh- |
men by the very safe margin of 22 j
to 7, the Gael babes nevertheless
showed plenty of power in this con- ;
test. The Saints, led by one Jack !
Baat, former captain of the cham
pionship Mission High outfit, put it
all over the Bear Cubs on that af- j
ternoon.
Card Season Tough
In contrast to this comparatively j
easy early season has been the Red- !
shirts' schedule. The Card babes !
had to fight plenty hard to stave off j
defeat at the hands of the strong j
Sacramento J.C. squad in the first j
start of the season.
The following week Bradshaw's
men rose to unexpected heights to \
defeat a highly touted aggregation
of freshmen from Santa Clara by
the close margin of 7 to 6. The next
week-end the Cards had a little
much-needed rest in coasting over
the Armstrong Business College
eleven by a 24 to 0 count, only to
have to go up against a hard-fight
ing team of Bruin babes in the
South the following Saturday.
In winning this contest the babes
suffered several injuries, one of
which will keep Edelen, first-string
end, out of Saturday's Saint game. !
Lineup Named
The other factor which favors
Saint Mary's on the dope sheet is
the fact that cach member of its j
squad had a stellar prep school
record'behind him. On the contrary, j
at the beginning of the season I
Bradshaw had only four men who j
were hailed as high-school stars.
The lineup for the Stanford fresh
men as announced by Bradshaw i
yesterday is as follows: Miller, left
end; Palamountain, left tackle; Tar
ver, left guard; Kantzner, center; j
Freeman, right guard; Tatum, right >
tackle; Monsalve, right end; Hill -
man, quarter; Maentz, left half;
White, right half; and Anderson,
full.
