Back Tecs in Order
The Misses Hicks and Van Wie,
! and Mrs. Hill gained international
! fame last spring on the team which
: represented the United States in an
i invasion of England. All of these
three stars were in the semi-finals
1 of the recnt national tourney, Vir
; ginia Van Wie losing out in the
' finals to Glenna Collett, who has
j announced that she cannot be here
j as planned.
j Though the back tees will be in
' order Saturday for the feminine
divot diggers, it is expected that the
â€¢ present women's course record of 86
i will be in danger. Par for fair golf
ers, which is set at 81, has never
been approached, while the best
mark recorded by men from the
1 back tees is 76,
