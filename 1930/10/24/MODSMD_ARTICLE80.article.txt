# RECORD OF RAY TANDY INDICATES TRACK PROWESS AS WELL AS GRIDIRON FAME
## 
### 
The athletic career of Captain Ray |
Tandy began in 1920, when he
played substitute tackle on a Long \
Beach high school team, captained
by Jim Lawson, later captain of
Stanford's 1924 eleven. Tandy filled
a regular berth at Long Beach in
'21, '22, and '23.
Tandy also went out for track in 1
high school in the shot and discus ;
events. He was on the team in '21, j
'22 rnd '23, and was champion of j
the Grade A high school league of
Southern California in the discus
and set new Long Beach high rec
ords of 137 feet in the discus and 49
feet, 2 inches in the 12-pound shot.
Comes Here in "2!»
lie came to Stanford in 1925 and
played freshman football and also ;
made his numerals in track setting i
a Little Big Meet record of 133 feet
in the discus.
Tandy was forced to stay out of i
school the following year because ;
of a bad knee. The knee was in
jured in high school football and had
never healed properly. An operation ,
performed the summer of his frosh
year was a failure. In all, three op
erations were performed upon the
knee, the third being successful.
Plays Army
In the fall of '27 he returned to I
the University and made the squad,
but did not play that year. In 1928
Tandy subbed at tackle for Artman 1
I and went East with the team that !
proved to be Army's nemesis.
This same year ('2B-'29) he was !
on the track squad and made the 1
trip to Philadelphia for the I.C. 4-A.
meet and took sixth in the discus. J
Last year Ray cinched a tackle
berth with his steady and discerning
play. While never a spectacular ;
player, Tandy is always absolutely |
dependable.
Elected Captain
In the winter quarter of last year
he contracted appendicitis and went |
home for an operation. During his j
absence, the elections for this year's j
football captain was held and he ■
was elected. Tandy, entirely un
aware of the honor bestowed upon \
him, picked up a newspaper one day
while he was convalescing and
learned that he had been elected
captain.
Upon returning to school he went
into training for track and made the j
trip cast to Boston but his weakened j
condition prevented him from doing j
much.
This year has been an unfortunate

one for Ray. He had played but half
of the West Coast Army game when
his left knee was injured, and he
was forced to leave the game. His
knee has prevented him from taking
part in the Minnesota and Oregon
State games.
It is very probable that he will
be back in his old place when the
whistle blows for tomorrow's strug
gle, although Chuck Ehrhorn has
been filling it thus far. Indeed, to
quote Tandy, "Ehrhorn has been
going so darned great that I may
not get to play even when my knee
is all right."

Stanford's 1924 eleven. Tandy filled
a regular berth at Long Beach in
'21, '22, and '23.
Tandy also went out for track in 1
high school in the shot and discus ;
events. He was on the team in '21, j
'22 rnd '23, and was champion of j
the Grade A high school league of
Southern California in the discus
and set new Long Beach high rec
ords of 137 feet in the discus and 49
feet, 2 inches in the 12-pound shot.
Comes Here in "2!»
lie came to Stanford in 1925 and
played freshman football and also ;
made his numerals in track setting i
a Little Big Meet record of 133 feet
in the discus.
Tandy was forced to stay out of i
school the following year because ;
of a bad knee. The knee was in
jured in high school football and had
never healed properly. An operation ,
performed the summer of his frosh
year was a failure. In all, three op
erations were performed upon the
knee, the third being successful.
Plays Army
In the fall of '27 he returned to I
the University and made the squad,
but did not play that year. In 1928
Tandy subbed at tackle for Artman 1
I and went East with the team that !
proved to be Army's nemesis.
This same year ('2B-'29) he was !
on the track squad and made the 1
trip to Philadelphia for the I.C. 4-A.
meet and took sixth in the discus. J
Last year Ray cinched a tackle
berth with his steady and discerning
play. While never a spectacular ;
player, Tandy is always absolutely |
dependable.
Elected Captain
In the winter quarter of last year
he contracted appendicitis and went |
home for an operation. During his j
absence, the elections for this year's j
football captain was held and he ■
was elected. Tandy, entirely un
aware of the honor bestowed upon \
him, picked up a newspaper one day
while he was convalescing and
learned that he had been elected
captain.
Upon returning to school he went
into training for track and made the j
trip cast to Boston but his weakened j
condition prevented him from doing j
much.
This year has been an unfortunate

one for Ray. He had played but half
of the West Coast Army game when
his left knee was injured, and he
was forced to leave the game. His
knee has prevented him from taking
part in the Minnesota and Oregon
State games.
It is very probable that he will
be back in his old place when the
whistle blows for tomorrow's strug
gle, although Chuck Ehrhorn has
been filling it thus far. Indeed, to
quote Tandy, "Ehrhorn has been
going so darned great that I may
not get to play even when my knee
is all right."
The athletic career of Captain Ray |
Tandy began in 1920, when he
played substitute tackle on a Long \
Beach high school team, captained
by Jim Lawson, later captain of
Stanford's 1924 eleven. Tandy filled

'21, '22, and '23.
