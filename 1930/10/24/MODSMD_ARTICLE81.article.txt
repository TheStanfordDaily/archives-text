# CARDINAL SOCCER SQUAD READY FOR CONFERENCE GAMES
## 
### 
Having gone through a stiff pre
liminary series of games with the
display of lots of strength in spite
of two defeats, the varsity soccer
squad is just about ready to start
hitting the high spots and win the
important college games now loom
ing up on its schedule.
The Rovers, to whom the Cards
lost U-0, and the Hornets, who had
to be content with a 2-2 iie which
non-collegiate organizations and as
such were not main objectives of
Coach Harry Maloney's men.
San Mateo Junior College took a
2-1 decision in the first league tilt
for the Redshirts, and that stung,
because it will count in the final
standings of the California Inter
collegiate Soccer Conference.
The Cards are out to win from
now on and will probably make a
start Tuesday afternoon when they
take on San Jose State here in the
second tilt of the conference sched
ule. San Jose did not look particu
larly impressive in winning from
the Stanford frosh Wednesday, so
the varsity ought to come through.
