# REDSHIRT VARSITY INCLUDES 21 MEN FROM '29 GRAYS
## Doub And Hand Make First String Positions; Grey, Colvin Also Good 
### 
Every year when Coach Pop War
ner makes the inevitable cut in his
varsity football squad, some 40 or
50 unfortunates bid farewell to the ,
varsity practice field and trot eff to
play the great college game under
the sympathetic guidance of Murray
Cuddeback and Don Robcsky. And
every year these two gridiron vet
erans instruct their charges, known
as the Stanford Grays, so well that j
Warner hauls a group of them out |
to play for him next season.
So it is, that included in the ranks
of the 52 huskies wearing the white
shirts of the Stanford Cardinal, who
will lumber on the field tomorrow
afternoon to face the fearsome Tro
jan from U.S.C., there will be an
even dozen men who only last year |
cavorted unhearalded and unsung
with the lowly Grays.
Nor are these promoted graylings !
the humblest members of the squad, j
Two of them rank as first string
men, namely, Bill Doub and "Red
Hand. Doub came up right at the i
start of the season and installed j
himself in the right end berth for
the first game, and nobody has been
able to dislodge him since. He is a
fighter from the word go, and a
mighty man to take out even though
weighing a scant 178 pounds.
Hand was tabbed for a substitute '
in the left guard position when the
practice season opened, but injury '
to Pete Hciser left an opening for
Red and he made the most of it. j
Having rated as first string guard I
in all the recent games, Red is iikely ;
to hold his place from now on even I
if Heiser gets back into his old form. '
Don Colvin's work at left end has
been one of the hopeful signs for
Card fans this season, and only the |
fact that he is competing with that j
slim, blond star, Phil Neill, keeps
him out of a regular berth. Another j
Gray man. George Grey, is the first ;
one called upon when big Dick
Bogue shows signs of tiring at left j
tackle. George is big and fast, and
he adds considerable ability at place
kicking to his accomplishments.
The backfield has its share of men
who were formerly with the re
serves. At the left hall back post
Spud Hardy has attracted lcjts of at
tention in the early season games
with his flashy open field running,
while at right half Phil Wilson has
displayed plenty of speed to rate
serious consideration. Tom Lambert,
also a right halfback, was considered
good enough to make the trip to
Minneapolis two weeks ago.
Other men from the Grays who
have made good on the varsity squad
are: Akeley Quirk, center; Phil
Baker, quarter; Ned Clark, end; Ed
win Walker, end; and A1 Hunt,
guard.
