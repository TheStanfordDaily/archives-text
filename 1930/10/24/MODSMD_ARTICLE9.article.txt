LONDON, Oct. 23. (TP)â€”British
and American yacht racing authori
ties have agreed to do away with
the "mechanical" yacht, which came
into fame in the recent races for
the America's cup, in future inter
national contests.
After a series of conferences in
which Norman Clark Neill and B.
Heckstall-Smith, British representa
tives, met first with New York
Yacht Club representatives then
with the council of the British Yacht
Racing Association, the council yes
terday voted to adopt with modifi
cations the New York Yacht Club's
rule rating racing yachts of above
14V2 meters in length.
This change eliminates many of
the ingenious but expensive devices
used by the cup defender Enterprise
in its recent triumph over Sir
Thomas Lipton's Shamrock V.
