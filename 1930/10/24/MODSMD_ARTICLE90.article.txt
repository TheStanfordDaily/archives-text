# YEARLING ELEVEN UNDEFEATED THUS FAR THIS SEASON
## Bradshaw's Babes Promise Strength For Future Varsity Teams 
### 
Starting the season with unknown
talent to work with, Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw took over the leadership
of the freshman eleven this fall with
some doubts as to the Card pros
pects for thu year.
With the exception of Maentz,
Monslave, Miller, Hillman and Ta
tum, Bradshaw's men entered the
farm with comparatively little prep
school experience.
The first test of the strength of the
babe eleven came just a month ago,
in the form of a strong Sacramento
Junior College team. In this con
test the Cards showed unexpected
promise in battling to a 13-13 tie.
On the following week-end, the
Santa Clara freshmen invaded the
farm with a team of gridmen fa
vored to down Bradshaw's men with
little trouble. This outfit of Broncos
had been highly touted by San
Francisco newspapers, one of them
in particular stating that this young
ster team was capable of giving its
big brother varsity squad a tough
battle.
But again the Stanford yearlings
came through, and after a losing
first half, managed to outplay Santa
Clara for a 7 to (5 win. The next
game was simply a light workout for
Bradshaw s warriors, the Cards hav
ing everything their own way
against the Armstrong Business Col
lege in a 24 to 0 victory.
Last week the Redshirts journeyed
south to meet an inspired Bruin,
battling in its own lair. The U.C.L.A.
babes were considered the best
yearling outfit ever mustered at that
institution.
But the Cards outfought the
Bruin, and returned to the Farm
with a 21 to 6 victory to their credit.
The showing of this yearling
eleven in going through the season
thus far undefeated, speakes well for
Warner's future varsity grid out
fit.
