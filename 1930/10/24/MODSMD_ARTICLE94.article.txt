# TROJAN QUARTERBACK BERTH IS TOSS-UP BETWEEN MARSH DUFFIELD, ORV MOHLER
## 
### 
Among the wealth of baekfield
material at the beck and call of
Coach Howard Jones, are two
gentlemen who play in the quarter
back position for the Trojans, and
regardless of which one is working
Saturday in that berth, he will bear
watching.
Marshall Duffield needs no intro
duction to the Cardinal rooters. Few
of them have forgotten the stellar
performance of that individual a
year ago in the Trojan contest. It
was he who was all over the field
against the Cards last year behind
that perfect interference which
blasted the hopes of Warner's ma
chine.
It was Duffield who tossed that
neat pass to Tappan which resulted
in the victory for Troy, and fiis
punting was a factor which was very
disconcerting to inhabitants of the
Farm that day.
Marsh's Last Year
Duffield is playing his third year
for Troy, and at the beginning of the
season was touted by many as a
cinch for ail-American honors. He
is short and stocky, and weighs 175
pounds; yet he is a speedy and elu
sive ball carrier. He is cool under
fire, and an excellent field general.
Not quite living up to expectations
this season, this Trojan threat is
finding his right to the quarterback
berth disputed by a young man who
starred on Troy's freshman eleven
last year, one Orv Mohler.
Orv First String
Mohler, though only a sophomore,
has shown so well that Coach Jones
has, since the Trojan upset at the
hands of Washington State, shifted

him to the first string berth in place
of Duffield. Like Duffield, he is
cool and alert. As a ball carrier his
chief asset is his combination driv
ing-weaving running style.
Against Washington State, it was
Mohler who saved his team from a
scoreless defeat. In the last half he
was the gentleman who tossed a
pass to Apsit to give the Trojans
their insufficient six points.
With these tv/o stars fighting it
out for the signal calling position
for U.S.C., Warner may well be on
guard for plays which start from
that position.

Marshall Duffield needs no intro
duction to the Cardinal rooters. Few
of them have forgotten the stellar
performance of that individual a
year ago in the Trojan contest. It
was he who was all over the field
against the Cards last year behind
that perfect interference which
blasted the hopes of Warner's ma
chine.
It was Duffield who tossed that
neat pass to Tappan which resulted
in the victory for Troy, and fiis
punting was a factor which was very
disconcerting to inhabitants of the
Farm that day.
Marsh's Last Year
Duffield is playing his third year
for Troy, and at the beginning of the
season was touted by many as a
cinch for ail-American honors. He
is short and stocky, and weighs 175
pounds; yet he is a speedy and elu
sive ball carrier. He is cool under
fire, and an excellent field general.
Not quite living up to expectations
this season, this Trojan threat is
finding his right to the quarterback
berth disputed by a young man who
starred on Troy's freshman eleven
last year, one Orv Mohler.
Orv First String
Mohler, though only a sophomore,
has shown so well that Coach Jones
has, since the Trojan upset at the
hands of Washington State, shifted

him to the first string berth in place
of Duffield. Like Duffield, he is
cool and alert. As a ball carrier his
chief asset is his combination driv
ing-weaving running style.
Against Washington State, it was
Mohler who saved his team from a
scoreless defeat. In the last half he
was the gentleman who tossed a
pass to Apsit to give the Trojans
their insufficient six points.
With these tv/o stars fighting it
out for the signal calling position
for U.S.C., Warner may well be on
guard for plays which start from
that position.
Among the wealth of baekfield
material at the beck and call of
Coach Howard Jones, are two
gentlemen who play in the quarter
back position for the Trojans, and
regardless of which one is working
Saturday in that berth, he will bear
watching.
