# TROJAN WARRIORS FIGHT INDIANS ON PROGRAM COVERS
## Mounted Figures On Silver Background Vie On 1930 Cover 
### 
The American Indian and the Tro
jan warrior will represent the rival
institutions of Stanford and U.S.C.
on the cover of the souvenir pro
grams for the game tomorrow. This
cover for the program is designed
by Patterson and Sullivan of San
Francisco.
On the left a mounted Trojan with
a sword in hand is being checked by
an Indian holding a bow and arrow.
On the right a man of Troy stops
with his sword, an Indian horseman
armed with a spear. The colors
stand out on a silver background.
The program consists of 32 pages,
the first 16 being devoted to U.S.C.,
the last to Stanford. On the center
spread is given the starting lineups.
Besides the usual features of indi
vidual photographs of the coaches
and players of both teams, and the
chart giving the name, age, weight,
number and years of competition of
every man on the squad, there will
be a full sized page devoted to the
last five football captains of the two
teams. Last year 35,000 copies were
sold. This year Lon Liebendorfer,
director of the News Service of the
Board of Athletic Control, has or
dered 40,000 copies to be printed.
