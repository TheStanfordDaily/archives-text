# NEUNER TO PROTEST REINSTATEMENT OF HIGH CASTE HINDU
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Oct. 23 (JP).â€”George
Neuner, United States attorney, was
today on his way to San Francisco
to appear before the Federal Circuit
j Court of Appeals to protest rein
statement of Rahka Singh Gherwal
' as a citizen of the United States.
Gherwal, a high caste Hindu, was
; formerly a well-known lecturer here.
In 1922 he was granted a naturaliza
tion certificate. A year later the
United States Supreme Court ruled
Hindus of high caste are not of white
blood and therefore not entitled to
citizenship. Gherwal's naturaliza
j tion certificate was cancelled.
In 1929 attorneys for the Hindu
asked to have the decree set aside
and Gherwal reinstated as a citizen,
claiming he had not been notified
j of the cancellation until too late to
protest. The motion was dismissed
i in Federal Court and appealed.
