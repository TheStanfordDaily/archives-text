# FAMILY HELP WANTED FOR UNEMPLOYED
## Americans Hoarding Money Charges Col. Arthur Woods in Talk 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 26. (TP) â€”A di
rect appeal to the individual Ameri
can family to do its bit toward re
lieving unemployment was bi'oad
cast tonight by Col. Arthur Woods,
chairman of President Hoover's
emergency committee, in an ad
dress over a National Broadcasting
Company network.
"Let us all spruce up our homes,"
said Col. Woods. "Make the little
repairs that are needed, do that lit
tle job of painting that we thought
about so long, fix up the odd cor
ners of the yard, replace the worn
out or broken parts that halt the
smooth running of the household.
"Let us do the same thing in our
communities. We can give work to
hundreds of thousands by improv
ing shabby playgrounds, unsightly
vacant lots, dirty streets, and by
cleaning up all those community
black spots that have annoyed us as
conscientious citizens so long."
Col. Woods, who spoke during
Collier's hour, said that if in the
aggregate 24,000,000 families fol
lowed this program as far as means
permitted, it would help to alleviate
the present condition.
"Savings bank deposits show an
increase, he daded. "Certainly
America has not become a hoarding
nation afraid of its own future. The
problem should be solved. It will be
solved. There can be no compromise
in its solution."
