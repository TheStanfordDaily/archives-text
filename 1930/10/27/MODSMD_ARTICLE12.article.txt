LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26 (TP).â€”A
bymb composed of black powder
was thrown against the side of
Trinity Methodist Church, South,
early today and broke several win
dows in the church and surround
ing rooming houses.
Police said the bomb apparently
had been thrown from an automo
bile. Skid marks on the pavement
in front of the building showed the
car evidently had been traveling
fast, had slowed suddenly until the
bomb was thrown, then speeded up
again.
Detective Lieutenant Frank Kat
zenberger, explosives expert, said
the bomb was a fireworks aerial
bomb, or "dago bomb," designed by
fireworks experts to make a loud
noise hut cause no damage. It is
used extensively in fireworks dis
plays to supply detonations.
It was the detonation that broke
the windows, Katzenberger said.
