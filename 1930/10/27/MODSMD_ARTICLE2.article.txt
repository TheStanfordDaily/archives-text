BERKELEY, Oct. 26. (/P)â€”Women
are snobs, says Dr. Max Radin, pro
fessor of law at the University of
California, and "there is more non
sense on the subject of 'ladies' than
on any other subject in the world."
These beliefs the professor bravely
'expounded in a recent speech be
fore the Berkeley Soroptimist Club.
' Women arc snobs because men
like to have them so," the professor
told his audience. '"By having their
women so men save themselves the
trouble of being snobs themselves
and at the same time reaping all the
benefits.
"Down from the days of the Spar
tans, Athenians ,and Romans, when
wives were chosen to fulfill certain
obligations and the country at large
principally because of their quali
ties as 'ladies,' men have reaped the
benefits of snobberv."
