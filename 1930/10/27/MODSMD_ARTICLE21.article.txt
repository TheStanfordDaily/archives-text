### 
PARKVILLE. Mo., Oct. 26 (£>>.— i
Dr. Frederick W. Hawley, president
of Park College, where a tramp ath- j
lete is just a tramp and a gridiron
only a cooking utensil, recommends I
open subsidization in Bib Six circles. I
Park College does not engage in
intercollegiate sports and its stu- .
dents are required to perform men- |
ial tasks on the campus to earn part I
of their expenses. I
"The rules," Dr. Hawley said, in 1
commenting on the qualified expul
sion of the University of Kansas
from conference sports yesterday, i
"are untenable, cannot be enforced,
and should be abolished.
"Subsidization, which exists now, ,
should be openly recognized and
controlled."'
