# CARDS TILT S.C.; WHAT A BRAWL!
## Pop Smokes Whole Carton Of Cigarettes 
### 
"What a spectacle, and, what a
spectacle."
Games of the Stanford-S.C. size
are like street accidentsâ€”everyone
rushes to one spot, acts abnormally
for a while, and rushes away. Only
difference is that Saturday they
went to the city afterward and
acted more abnormally yet.
Bumped cars and busted ones,
pretty girls and prettier ones, sou
venir and flower hawkers every
where, and as many cops as hawk
ers. The only scalping done was
done openly, the ducats going for a
a dollar, half a dollar, and nothing.
Pop's Cigarettes
A carton of cigarettes for Pop is
standard equipment that football
managers must furnish at every
game. And between halves, he did
not exhort the team with tears in
his voice, or swing his arms and
tell the boys they must do it for
dear ol' alma mammy, college
squawkies to the contrary.
But the game itself, that was his
tory, college history, and just as
hard as history for Stanford stu
dents to swallow. Every time a
Card back came through the line, a
Trojan was there to meet him like
a bill collector keeping an appoint
ment. It looked like the old song hit,
"Me for you and you for me, tea for
two and honors to Howard."
Insult to Injury
Howard Jones . . . what will the
East think of him now, when they
remember what Stanford did to Ca
gle and his pals? The height of
insult came when the S.C. band was
filing out before half-time. Red
hatted rooters came to their feet
with a roar as Moffatt hooked a nice
pass from Rothert for 13 yards, and
the band men didn't even look
around.
"Beauty in Distress, or Why Mary
Missed the Game" is a picture to
be seen around the Stadium before
every game. Buster Keaton and
other stars were spectators Satur
day, but they didn't get the pub
licity that a little black dog did
when it was hauled off the field.
