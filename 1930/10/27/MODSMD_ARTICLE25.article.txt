### 
FALL RIVER MILLS, Oct. 26 </P).â€”
What was believed a tragedy of cen
turies ago was revealed recently
when part of a man's skeleton was
uncovered by a highway construc
tion crew near McArthur. The bones
were buried beneath 12 feet of lava,
which led to the belief that the man
was overtaken by the flow of molten
rock as he fled before it. The area
was once covered by Mt. Lassen
lava.
The skull was fairly well pre
served, and a few of the larger
bones were found nearby.
