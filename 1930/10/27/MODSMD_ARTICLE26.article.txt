# MAJOR TEAMS TO NEED SMALL GAMES
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 26 (TP).â€”Chick
Meehan. head coach at New York
I University, can't foresee the day
when big football teams will play
none but big teams and the little
fellows will stay in their own class.
"The boys try too hard against
major opponents in the early sea
son and they're not ready," he says,
j "They're not in condition for gruel
i ing games, haven't learned enough.
They get hurt. Look at Harvard,
scrimmaged the third day out this
season and still suffering from in-
I juries."
