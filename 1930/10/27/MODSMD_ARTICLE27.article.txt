# KEHO WINS HIGH PRAISE IN COMEDY
## Star Shows Comic Flare In Title Role Of Society Farce 
### Staff Reviewer 
Katherine Keho again showed
herself as a consummate actress in
the title role of "Mrs. Bumpstead-
Leigh" Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall.
Her work to a large extent carried
the whole play. She has a real flare
for comedy, and successfully por
trayed the dual role of Mrs. Bump
stead-Leigh, the cultured English
woman, and that of the daughter of
a seller of patent medicine in In
diana.
Old Play
II did not take long to see that
"Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh" is a play
of former days. If the play had been
produced in period, that of two
decades ago, it would have been
less ludicrous. With clothes and
apartments that went with their
sentiments, Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh's
hosts, the Rawsons, might be more
diverting and less banal.
It would have been easier to un
derstand their horror of publicity
and to believe that they had not had
pictures of themselves and their
cold creams in the papers.
Thompson Entertaining
In the role of Peter Swallow, sel
ler of tombstones and self-styled
"silver-tongued orator," Joe Thomp
son gave a very entertaining per
formance. His endless flow of con
versation and awkward gestures
were greatly enjoyed.
Harry Lee Logan was refreshing
and natural in the part of Geoffrey
Rawson. He evidenced sympathetic
understanding of the character he
played and was pleasing throughout
the production.
Hugh cs Convincing
As Mrs. De Salle, who was forced
into being a lady by her ambitious
daughter, Mina Hughes did well.
She was convincingly the anxious
tool of the social climber.
Paul Speegle was poorly cast as
Anthony Rawson, worldly and snob
bish. The audience expected him to
be funny, but the role was not of
that type. Patty Edwards was pleas
ant in the role of the ingenue.
Morgan Plays Maid
Lucille Morgan kept well to her
part as the pretty, excitable maid,
and Vallejo Gantner did a good bit
in the role of the dignified butler.
Emeline Nollen seemed immature
for the part of the elderly spinster,
Miss Rawson. John Atwill was au
stere as Justin Rawson, and Mary
Lou Leistner appeared as the very
flighty Mrs. Leavitt. Arthur Katzcv
enacted Stephen Leavitt.
Harold Helvenston was not up to
his usual form from the point of
view of direction, although the pro
duction reached a high level in
many places. The choice of the play
prevented any opportunity for
subtlety of performance with the
exception of a few roles.
Frederick Stover deserves real
praise for the excellent setting.

herself as a consummate actress in
the title role of "Mrs. Bumpstead-
Leigh" Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall.
Her work to a large extent carried
the whole play. She has a real flare
for comedy, and successfully por
trayed the dual role of Mrs. Bump
stead-Leigh, the cultured English
woman, and that of the daughter of
a seller of patent medicine in In
diana.
Old Play
II did not take long to see that
"Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh" is a play
of former days. If the play had been
produced in period, that of two
decades ago, it would have been
less ludicrous. With clothes and
apartments that went with their
sentiments, Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh's
hosts, the Rawsons, might be more
diverting and less banal.
It would have been easier to un
derstand their horror of publicity
and to believe that they had not had
pictures of themselves and their
cold creams in the papers.
Thompson Entertaining
In the role of Peter Swallow, sel
ler of tombstones and self-styled
"silver-tongued orator," Joe Thomp
son gave a very entertaining per
formance. His endless flow of con
versation and awkward gestures
were greatly enjoyed.
Harry Lee Logan was refreshing
and natural in the part of Geoffrey
Rawson. He evidenced sympathetic
understanding of the character he
played and was pleasing throughout
the production.
Hugh cs Convincing
As Mrs. De Salle, who was forced
into being a lady by her ambitious
daughter, Mina Hughes did well.
She was convincingly the anxious
tool of the social climber.
Paul Speegle was poorly cast as
Anthony Rawson, worldly and snob
bish. The audience expected him to
be funny, but the role was not of
that type. Patty Edwards was pleas
ant in the role of the ingenue.
Morgan Plays Maid
Lucille Morgan kept well to her
part as the pretty, excitable maid,
and Vallejo Gantner did a good bit
in the role of the dignified butler.
Emeline Nollen seemed immature
for the part of the elderly spinster,
Miss Rawson. John Atwill was au
stere as Justin Rawson, and Mary
Lou Leistner appeared as the very
flighty Mrs. Leavitt. Arthur Katzcv
enacted Stephen Leavitt.
Harold Helvenston was not up to
his usual form from the point of
view of direction, although the pro
duction reached a high level in
many places. The choice of the play
prevented any opportunity for
subtlety of performance with the
exception of a few roles.
Frederick Stover deserves real
praise for the excellent setting.
Katherine Keho again showed
herself as a consummate actress in
the title role of "Mrs. Bumpstead-
Leigh" Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall.
