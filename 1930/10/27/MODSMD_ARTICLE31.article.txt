# TROJANS ROUT WARNER'S MEN BY 41-12 SCORE
## Inability Of Stanford To Employ Fundamentals Leads To Defeat CARD ATTACK CHECKED 
### Len Kullmann 
Smothered beneath an avalanche
of touchdowns, a Stanford varsity
fell before the onslaught of the Tro
jans in the Stanford stadium Sat
urday by the most overwhelming
score ever piled up against a Cardi
nal team since Warner has taken the
helm. Final reading of the score
board gave Southern California a
41 to 12 triumph.
Poor tackling, ineffective block
ing, and a general inability to per
form the fundamental operations of
football were responsible for the
crushing defeat of the Redshirts.
Before three minutes of the law
quarter had passed, the Trojans
scored. Recovering a fumble on the
Cardinal 26-yard line, Duffield on
a spin play carried the ball out of
bounds on the 3-yard stripe. Three
plays later Baker was converting
Shaver's touchdown to put Troy out
in front.
Kothert Punts
Receiving S.C.'s kick-off and fail
ing to gain, Rothert on his second
attempt punted to his own 48-yard
line. Eight pldys later, aided by run ;
of 16, 15, and 18 yards by Duffield
and Musick, the Trojans had scored
again. Baker's conversion made the
count 14-0.
After Shaver had kicked out of
bounds on Southern California's 26-
yard marker in the first period, Ro
thert passed to Moffatt who tramped
18 yards to a touchdown. Rothert's
attempted place-kick was wide. In
the second quarter Mohlcr massa
cred the Cardinal defense to place
the third touchdown in the records,
but Baker's kick was no good, mak
ing the score 20-6.
Score on Pass
Troy knocked at the gates again
before the half ended. From their
40-, the Trojans motored to the Card
16-yard line on plays by Mohlcr and
Shaver. Mohler's pass to Arbelbide
accounted for the fourth touchdown
from that point, and Baker's kick
made the score at half time 27-6.
Coming back with a rush, the Tro
jans pushed over another touch
down early in the third quarter al
ter being held for downs on the
Card 6-yard line. From Cardinal
territory just over the mid - field
marker, Duffield and Musick
smashed down to the end zone, Duf
field going over standing up on a
spin play. Another placement put
S.C. stock up to 34.
After holding the Trojans on the
18-yard line, Stanford drove down
to a touchdown. A pass, Rothert to
Moffatt, and Moffatt's run of 27
yards moved the ball to S.C.'s 32-
yard line. Here interference with a
pass receiver placed the Cards 17
yards from scoring territory. Mof
fatt took a pass from Simkins to
boost Stanford's total for the game
to 12 points.
Stanford kicked off following the
touchdown, and after a line play
had failed to gain, Pinckert on a re
verse galloped 74 yards for the final
touchdown of the game. The con
version made the final count South
ern California 41, Stanford 12.
