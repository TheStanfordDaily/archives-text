# LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT

The Trojan warrior came, saw. and conquered. Stanford today
i recovering from the shock of the 41 12 victory the University
of Southern California football team won from the Cardinals.
There's manv a headache and hangover this morning from the
effects of mpurning for the P>ig Red Machine that failed to function
Saturday afternoon.
Thousands of persons saw the Trojans sweep to victory over
the Kedshirts; thousands went away from the game disgruntled or
jubilant over the showing of their respective elevens; thousands
witnessed the other thousands that came to cheer and see what had
been predicted as a battle royal of two of the coast's leading grid
iron outfits.
It was obviouslv a game where one team was bewildered by the
antics of the other squad. The fact that Stanford whs unable to
produce results does not necessarily mean that the Cardinals were
a weak team.
J'.affled by the effectiveness of the Trojan deception and de
fense. Stanford was unable to step into its stride. Accordingly, the
game suffered, and Stanford adherents went away feeling more
than glum.
I hit. after all, it was just another football game. There are
01 hers to comeâ€”Washington, California, Dartmouth. The U.S.C.
game is now onlv a memorv, the sooner forgotten the Ix'tter.
