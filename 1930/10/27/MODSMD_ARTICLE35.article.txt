Subsidy, the bogie of collide athletics, has again reared its ugly
liead into the national spotlight.
Members of the 1% Six Conference are embroiled in a bitter
row, punctuated with a bewildering number of charges and counter
charges. centering on lames A. Hausch, star Kansas University
halfback. It is alleged that I'.ausch has received money for playing
(tn the Kansas team.
Instead of conducting a thorough investigation into Bausch's
standing, the Kansas officials have attempted to stifle the reports
and suppress information on the matter. A question as vital as one
involving American college sportsmanship should be given fullest
publicity.
At the same time a cheering report comes from George Wash
ington University where six members of the freshman football team
have been dismissed from the squad following their demands that
they be paid for their gridiron services.
The sextet issued an ultimatum that they would leave school
unless they were granted free room, board, and tuition. As a reply,
lames YY. Pixlee, director of athletics, cut the men from the team
at once, and invited them to leave the university.
< ieorge Washington athletics were cleaned up last year when
I'ixlee took control of what had become a most unhealthy situation.
Until that time football men had regularly received special conces
sions, which not only paid their way through school, but provided
ample pocket money besides.
I'ixlee's action should light the path back to true sportsmanship
for institutions where teams made up of men who play for love of
their alma mater have been supplanted by the best elevens that
money can buy.
