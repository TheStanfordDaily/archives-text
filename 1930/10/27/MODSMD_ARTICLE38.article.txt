LILIOM —At the New Stanford.
Decidedly unreal is the film ver
sion of Franz Molnar's stage success,
Liliom, now showing at the New
Stanford. Passenger 01 i a train to
Hell, Charles Farrell, as Liliom, is
given a second chance and returns
to earth. Heaven is made a very
simple place, with trains to and fro,
meeting at regular intervals with
Pullmans for the lower world.
Gabriel, bless his heart, wears a
white linen suit, black bow tie, and
is utterly incapable of blowing his
horn.
In the most serious moments,
Liliom ruins the entire effect with
a childish voice. Rose Hobart,
though, is startlingly real. Her voice
is lovely, deep-toned, and vibrant.
And H. B. Warner gives his usual
well-turned performance.
The scenes are good. Contrast is
always evident. An excruciating
death scene takes place against the
background of a Budapest beer
garden, and play-park. —V. B. T.
THE PROFESSOR'S WIFE. By
Bravig Imbs. The Dial Press,
New York. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
On the surface this is merely an
innocuous, gossipy monologue, on
the doings and sayings of a profes
sor and his wife, the social mentors
on their campus, from the mouth
of a student who is working his way
as their butler.

But the reader who knows his
campus cannot miss the satirical
j vein which lies beneath the sur-
I face. The book is full of incidents
j and characters that any college stu
| dent will recognize as belonging to
! his own campus. It is hard to be
! lievc that certain parts of the book
were not actually written about
I Stanford.
Good, amusing, light reading for
1 anyone, the book is invaluable to
the person who is even vaguely
! amused or interested by the activi
i ties and personnel of our own fac
: ulty. —S. C. A.
ON YOUR BACK—At the Varsity
Theatre.
The reflection of brilliant society
| in the Fifth Avenue dress shop of
an ambitious mother is the back
ground of "On Your Back." With
Irene Rich as the jealous, self-sacri
ficing mother, and Raymond Hackett
J as the spoiled and determined son,
the plot proceeds quite as would be
expected.
The son finally wins his girl, and
the. mother decides to accept the
girl, but not without a few rebellious
! scenes.
"On Your Back" is just an ordin
ary show, with the ordinary trite
j remarks, so that one can practically
anticipate every word, but there are
a few amusing episodes, and Irene
Rich does her part very well.
