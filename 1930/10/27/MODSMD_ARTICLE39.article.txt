The funniest thing just happened.
Someone asked us what we thought
of the football game Saturday, and
laughed. . . . He looks so tired and
purposeless, stretched out there on
the floor.
He was a good friend, too. But
even best friends ought to remem
ber that football is only a secondary
sport on this campus. It's ping-pong
that really counts.
A couple of S.C. co-eds, talk
ing it all over, declared that
most of our team members are
too refined, that they don't look
nearly brutal enough to con
vince an opponent. (Rise and
bow, Phil—that may be the best
we can do for you for a long
time).
When the S.C. halfback was
knocked unconscious and carried off
the field, in the last quarter, a little
boy near us in the stand said,
"Whassa matter with him, mamma?
Has he got concoction of the brain?"
We sometimes wonder
It's so much easier to be a {food
sport and wager your last nickel
before the first three minutes of
play. We were so sure, and now
look what they've done to us. The
Five Hundred really ought to stop
thinking of their new gym, for a
while, and start selling tinfoil for

! the Relief Fund for Homeless,
j Starving Stanford Betters.

that "Dogga Delta Pupsilon isn't like
■it was in our time, eh. Hank old
boy? Didn't have any cooky-eating
tea-hounds, then." (Please get that
l perfectly doggy pun!)
We're convinced that the main
difference between The City
down South and The City up
here, is that instead of subsi
, dized athletes we have subsi
dized hotel waiters.

Noticed in and around our side of
the Stadium, Saturday—
3.000.000 curses, effective and
not so effective. 300.000 automo
biles—but not in tiiat mob.
30.000 Stanford grads who
hoped—hopes, not so effective.
3,000 red S's on white chrysanthe
mums on as many left shoulders—ef
fective, but not. successful. 300 in

tion, explaining ineffectively how it
should be done. 30 players who wish
i (quite ineffectively) that the first
three quarters could be played over
again. And three mentors, very ef

Noticed in and around our side of
the Stadium, Saturday—
3.000.000 curses, effective and
not so effective. 300.000 automo
biles—but not in tiiat mob.
30.000 Stanford grads who
hoped—hopes, not so effective.
3,000 red S's on white chrysanthe
mums on as many left shoulders—ef
fective, but not. successful. 300 in
| tramural athletes in the rooting sec
tion, explaining ineffectively how it
should be done. 30 players who wish
i (quite ineffectively) that the first
three quarters could be played over
again. And three mentors, very ef
fectively disgruntled—that is Pop,
I and Denny, and We
The funniest thing just happened.
Someone asked us what we thought
of the football game Saturday, and
laughed. . . . He looks so tired and
purposeless, stretched out there on
the floor.
He was a good friend, too. But
even best friends ought to remem
ber that football is only a secondary
sport on this campus. It's ping-pong
that really counts.
A couple of S.C. co-eds, talk
ing it all over, declared that
most of our team members are
too refined, that they don't look
nearly brutal enough to con
vince an opponent. (Rise and
bow, Phil—that may be the best
we can do for you for a long
time).
When the S.C. halfback was
knocked unconscious and carried off
the field, in the last quarter, a little
boy near us in the stand said,
"Whassa matter with him, mamma?
Has he got concoction of the brain?"
We sometimes wonder
It's so much easier to be a {food
sport and wager your last nickel
before the first three minutes of
play. We were so sure, and now
look what they've done to us. The
Five Hundred really ought to stop
thinking of their new gym, for a
while, and start selling tinfoil for
