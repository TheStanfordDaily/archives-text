## SEEK CONSIDERATION

The Editor, Sir:
The freshman football team went
out and did its best to bring glory
to Stanford and to entertain the
I spectators. After the game the mern
; bers of the team changed their
clothes and came back to watch the
varsity play. They had participant
! passes and were directed to benches
1 placed around the edge of the field
from where they could hardly see
the players and could not even tell
I what kind of plays they were mak
; ing.
| These, the fellows that were the
most interested and the most learned
in football, are placed where they
: get very little pleasure and no
benefit out of watching another
â€¢ team play. And as a final insult an
I officer told some of them that they
; were "lucky to be on the field and
I able to see the game at all."
I think that a row in the rooting
: section might be reserved for the
players next year.
Sincerely yours, A Frosh.
