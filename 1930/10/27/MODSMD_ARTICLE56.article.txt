# INTRAMURAL TEAMS TO OPEN FOOTBALL SERIES WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Intramural touch football will got
under way Wednesday afternoon,
according to Parker Reed, manager
of intramural sports, who will re
lease ihe schedule of games tomor
row.
Reed is introducing a somewhat
different arrangement for intra
mural play this fall. Games will be
played four days a week instead of
five, Fridays being left open for
games that cannot be played on
their regularly scheduled dates.
With this open day in the sched
ule Reed states that there should
be no reason for forfeited games.
Under his present plan if a team
forfeits it will automatically be
dropped from play, unless it notifies
Reed of intention to default previ
ous to game time. In the latter case
the team loses its entry points.
The touch football games are to
be played on the four fields adjoin
ing the military stables. Four games
will be played at 3 o'clock and four
at 4 o'clock.
