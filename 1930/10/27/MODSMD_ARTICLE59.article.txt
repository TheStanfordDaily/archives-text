RECAPITULATION
Opening up gaping holes in the
Cardinal forward wall, the charge
of the Trojan line was easily the
outstanding feature of the game
Saturday. Stanford's offense was
smothered at the line of scrimmage;
Southern California's ball carriers
were sprung out into the great open
spaces where the secondary defense
was stationed.
Phil Neill too!. ;,uite a bouncing
during the time he was in the game.
Arbelbide and Pinckert combined
to remove Neill from all plays di
rected at the left side of the line,
and on Rothert's kicks Neill was
never able to get more than five
yards from the line of scrimmage.
Baker's kick-offs put Stanford in
the hole at the beginning of play.
Traveling well into the end zone,
;jnd high enough to permit the Tro
jans to swarm down the field under
them, Baker's boots were never run
back in any spectacular manner.
The Trojan guard also hit the ball
hard on his conversions, making
five of the six count.
Marger Apsit and Mar Albertson
were both carried from the field of
play. Apsit suffered a slight con
cussion of the brain, and an ambu
lance was summoned to remove him
from (he Stadium. Albertson's knee
was injured, and the fair-haired
center will probably be out of the
game for a week or two.
Ernie Caddel's speed showed to
good advantage against the South
ern Californians. Out-running
would-be tacklers, "Racehorse"
Ernie galloped 47 yards on one re
verse, and picked up yardage on the
majority of his carries. Caddel's
runs were all made without the as J
sistance of any interference worthy
of mention.
Caglieri proved to be a ball
hound, recovering two S.C. fumbles,
and in general distinguishing him
self in the backfield. Harry Hillman,
handicapped by his iron mask, hit
as hard as ever although Stanford's
sieve-like line made him look fool
lish on several attempted fake re
verses.
In the forward wall, "Red" Hand
and Perry Taylor were outstanding.
Taylor in particular came tip with
vital tackles in crucial moments,
while Hand's position proved to be
the least fruitful as far as the Tro
jan power plays were concerned.
Contrasted with the ineffectual
kicks of DufTield, Shaver, and oth
ers, Stanford can well be proud of
Rothert's punting. Standing on his
own 25-yard line, Harlow pushed
the ball over the Southern Cali
fornia goal line upon one occasion,
<nd the Cardinal fullback averaged
i trifle over 40 yards on his kicks.
Southern California averaged but
'A yards per kick.
Stanford sagged toward the end
>1 the first quarter when Rothert's
conversion was wide, leaving the
,core 14-6. With the Trojans two
ouchdowns to the good, the Red
shirts appeared to be a beaten team
ust as California was in a similar
position during the Big Game of
to.
Indicating what was to come, last
Thursday's practice found the Grays
using Trojan plays in dummy scrim
nage with the varsity. On their
irst attempt, a spin play, the Grays
hot a man into the open over left
ackle for a touchdown. Gi%'en their
irst scoring opportunity, the Tro
ans put Dufl'ield through the same
naneuver for a 23-yard gain, leav
ng the ball on the Cards' 3-yard
tripe.
Don Colvin turned in one of the
irettiest plays of the clash when he
eapcd high in the air to snag Rin
ala's pass on the Troy 14-yard line,
""lie toss was fully six feet over his
lead, and the Trojan covering Col

Opening up gaping holes in the
Cardinal forward wall, the charge
of the Trojan line was easily the
outstanding feature of the game
Saturday. Stanford's offense was
smothered at the line of scrimmage;
Southern California's ball carriers
were sprung out into the great open
spaces where the secondary defense
was stationed.
Phil Neill too!. ;,uite a bouncing
during the time he was in the game.
Arbelbide and Pinckert combined
to remove Neill from all plays di
rected at the left side of the line,
and on Rothert's kicks Neill was
never able to get more than five
yards from the line of scrimmage.
Baker's kick-offs put Stanford in
the hole at the beginning of play.
Traveling well into the end zone,
;jnd high enough to permit the Tro
jans to swarm down the field under
them, Baker's boots were never run
back in any spectacular manner.
The Trojan guard also hit the ball
hard on his conversions, making
five of the six count.
Marger Apsit and Mar Albertson
were both carried from the field of
play. Apsit suffered a slight con
cussion of the brain, and an ambu
lance was summoned to remove him
from (he Stadium. Albertson's knee
was injured, and the fair-haired
center will probably be out of the
game for a week or two.
Ernie Caddel's speed showed to
good advantage against the South
ern Californians. Out-running
would-be tacklers, "Racehorse"
Ernie galloped 47 yards on one re
verse, and picked up yardage on the
majority of his carries. Caddel's
runs were all made without the as J
sistance of any interference worthy
of mention.
Caglieri proved to be a ball
hound, recovering two S.C. fumbles,
and in general distinguishing him
self in the backfield. Harry Hillman,
handicapped by his iron mask, hit
as hard as ever although Stanford's
sieve-like line made him look fool
lish on several attempted fake re
verses.
In the forward wall, "Red" Hand
and Perry Taylor were outstanding.
Taylor in particular came tip with
vital tackles in crucial moments,
while Hand's position proved to be
the least fruitful as far as the Tro
jan power plays were concerned.
Contrasted with the ineffectual
kicks of DufTield, Shaver, and oth
ers, Stanford can well be proud of
Rothert's punting. Standing on his
own 25-yard line, Harlow pushed
the ball over the Southern Cali
fornia goal line upon one occasion,
<nd the Cardinal fullback averaged
i trifle over 40 yards on his kicks.
Southern California averaged but
'A yards per kick.
Stanford sagged toward the end
>1 the first quarter when Rothert's
conversion was wide, leaving the
,core 14-6. With the Trojans two
ouchdowns to the good, the Red
shirts appeared to be a beaten team
ust as California was in a similar
position during the Big Game of
to.
Indicating what was to come, last
Thursday's practice found the Grays
using Trojan plays in dummy scrim
nage with the varsity. On their
irst attempt, a spin play, the Grays
hot a man into the open over left

irst scoring opportunity, the Tro
ans put Dufl'ield through the same
naneuver for a 23-yard gain, leav

Don Colvin turned in one of the
irettiest plays of the clash when he

Opening up gaping holes in the
Cardinal forward wall, the charge
of the Trojan line was easily the
outstanding feature of the game
Saturday. Stanford's offense was
smothered at the line of scrimmage;
Southern California's ball carriers
were sprung out into the great open
spaces where the secondary defense
was stationed.
Phil Neill too!. ;,uite a bouncing
during the time he was in the game.
Arbelbide and Pinckert combined
to remove Neill from all plays di
rected at the left side of the line,
and on Rothert's kicks Neill was
never able to get more than five
yards from the line of scrimmage.
Baker's kick-offs put Stanford in
the hole at the beginning of play.
Traveling well into the end zone,
;jnd high enough to permit the Tro
jans to swarm down the field under
them, Baker's boots were never run
back in any spectacular manner.
The Trojan guard also hit the ball
hard on his conversions, making
five of the six count.
Marger Apsit and Mar Albertson
were both carried from the field of
play. Apsit suffered a slight con
cussion of the brain, and an ambu
lance was summoned to remove him
from (he Stadium. Albertson's knee
was injured, and the fair-haired
center will probably be out of the
game for a week or two.
Ernie Caddel's speed showed to
good advantage against the South
ern Californians. Out-running
would-be tacklers, "Racehorse"
Ernie galloped 47 yards on one re
verse, and picked up yardage on the
majority of his carries. Caddel's
runs were all made without the as J
sistance of any interference worthy
of mention.
Caglieri proved to be a ball
hound, recovering two S.C. fumbles,
and in general distinguishing him
self in the backfield. Harry Hillman,
handicapped by his iron mask, hit
as hard as ever although Stanford's
sieve-like line made him look fool
lish on several attempted fake re
verses.
In the forward wall, "Red" Hand
and Perry Taylor were outstanding.
Taylor in particular came tip with
vital tackles in crucial moments,
while Hand's position proved to be
the least fruitful as far as the Tro
jan power plays were concerned.
Contrasted with the ineffectual
kicks of DufTield, Shaver, and oth
ers, Stanford can well be proud of
Rothert's punting. Standing on his
own 25-yard line, Harlow pushed
the ball over the Southern Cali
fornia goal line upon one occasion,
<nd the Cardinal fullback averaged
i trifle over 40 yards on his kicks.
Southern California averaged but
'A yards per kick.
Stanford sagged toward the end
>1 the first quarter when Rothert's
conversion was wide, leaving the
,core 14-6. With the Trojans two
ouchdowns to the good, the Red
shirts appeared to be a beaten team
ust as California was in a similar
position during the Big Game of
to.
Indicating what was to come, last
Thursday's practice found the Grays
using Trojan plays in dummy scrim
nage with the varsity. On their
irst attempt, a spin play, the Grays
hot a man into the open over left
ackle for a touchdown. Gi%'en their
irst scoring opportunity, the Tro
ans put Dufl'ield through the same
naneuver for a 23-yard gain, leav
ng the ball on the Cards' 3-yard
tripe.
Don Colvin turned in one of the
irettiest plays of the clash when he
eapcd high in the air to snag Rin
ala's pass on the Troy 14-yard line,
""lie toss was fully six feet over his
lead, and the Trojan covering Col
in did not bother to leap for it.
"olvin also produced a nice game
I end during his sojourn in the fes
ivities. —L. K., Jr.
