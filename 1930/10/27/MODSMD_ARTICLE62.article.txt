line backed up with a fast, hard
driving backfield, Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's yearling gridmen went
down to a 21 to 0 defeat at the
hands of the Saint Mary's freshman
1 eleven in the preliminary contest
Saturday.
After a nearly even first quarter
in which both teams had chances
to score, only to lose the ball in
the shadow of the opponent's goal
! posts, the Redshirt line began to
crumble in the second period and
the Saints recorded the first touch
down.
Starting from their own 28-yard
line, the Gael babes on a few plays
featured by a 20-yard pass, Baat to
Hubbs, and a 25-yard run by Par
tee, put the ball over and converted
to make it 7 to 0.

Stanford's 30-yard line to the
Saints' 15. Here Bradshaw's men
tried a couple of laterals, but were
smeared on each attempt and lost
the ball on downs as the half gun
sounded.
Again in the third period the Card
passing attack began functioning,
the Redshirts taking the ball to the
Saints' 13-yard marker, only to have
their plays smeared again by the
fast-charging Gael line.
Stanford Fumbles
A little later the Stanford babes
fumbled on their own 40-yard line,
from where on a few plays featur
ing runs by Baat, Hubbs, and Par
tee, the Moragans put over their
second score and converted.
The Saints continued to outcharge
i Bradshaw's men through the last
quarter, putting one over for the

The Saints continued to outcharge
i Bradshaw's men through the last
quarter, putting one over for the
final touchdown just as the gun
ending the game sounded. The
j converted point made it 21 for St.
MaiVs.
Battling against odds of a stronger
line backed up with a fast, hard
driving backfield, Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's yearling gridmen went
down to a 21 to 0 defeat at the
hands of the Saint Mary's freshman
1 eleven in the preliminary contest
Saturday.
After a nearly even first quarter
in which both teams had chances
to score, only to lose the ball in
the shadow of the opponent's goal
! posts, the Redshirt line began to
crumble in the second period and
the Saints recorded the first touch
down.
Starting from their own 28-yard
line, the Gael babes on a few plays
featured by a 20-yard pass, Baat to
Hubbs, and a 25-yard run by Par
tee, put the ball over and converted
to make it 7 to 0.
Cards Miss Score
Just before the half gun, the Card
yearlings missed their best chance
to score. Two long passes by Ander
son, with Maentz and Spencer doing
the receiving, carried the ball from
Stanford's 30-yard line to the
Saints' 15. Here Bradshaw's men
tried a couple of laterals, but were
smeared on each attempt and lost
the ball on downs as the half gun
sounded.
Again in the third period the Card
passing attack began functioning,
the Redshirts taking the ball to the
Saints' 13-yard marker, only to have
their plays smeared again by the
fast-charging Gael line.
Stanford Fumbles
A little later the Stanford babes
fumbled on their own 40-yard line,
from where on a few plays featur
ing runs by Baat, Hubbs, and Par
tee, the Moragans put over their
second score and converted.
The Saints continued to outcharge
i Bradshaw's men through the last
quarter, putting one over for the
final touchdown just as the gun
ending the game sounded. The
j converted point made it 21 for St.
MaiVs.
