# STANFORD SOCCER VARSITY FAVORITE TO BEAT SAN JOSE
## Cards To Meet Staters In Second Conference Game Tomorrow 
### Jack Jernegan 
Advance dope will be very much
upset tomorrow if the Stanford soc
ccr varsity fails to conquer San
Jose State in the encounter here.
The game will be Stanford's second
contest in the California Intercol
legiate Soccer Conference race, and
inasmuch as the Cards dropped
their first game to San Mateo
will be out for blood tomorrow.
All indications tend to show that
Coach Harry Maloney's men v/ill
collect their first victory of the sea
son from the valley team, for the
Cards have a team which is really
strong despite early losses while
San Jose has displayed no compar
able strength.
The Staters downed the Stanford
freshmen 5-1 last week, but did not
have as much of an edge as the
score indicates. A weak goal defense
cost the babes most of the adverse
tallies.
Maloney has been having trouble
with the offensive work of his for
wards, but some shifts in the posi
tions have improved the situation,
and this defect should be remedied
by tomorrow.
