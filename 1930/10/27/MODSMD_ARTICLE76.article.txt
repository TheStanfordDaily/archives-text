### 
Plans are being made by A.W.S.
Council to attend a conference for
all four-year universities and col
leges in California, to be held at
Fresno this week-end.
Stanford, California, and Mills
will present for discussion a sug- j
gestion concerning a students' lead
ership course, held either in con
nection with summer school session j
for university credit, or given at a j
two-week institute devoted to that
subject exclusively.
The three schools have already ;
held a previous discussion of the j
subject a week ago at Mills. The idea i
originated in the Y.W.C.A. and was j
turned over to A.W.S. presidents j
and deans of women.
The conference program includes |
a talk by Dr. Hubert Phillips, pro- |
lessor of social sciences at Fresno
State College, on "Internationalism I
and the Part We Play in It.'' Dr.
Ethel Sabin-Smith, professor of
psychology at Mills, will speak on
"Types of College Women."
Betty Alden, Betty Clarke, Sarah
Grant, Miriam Strout, and Barbara j
Beach Thompson are A.W.S. Coun
cil members.
