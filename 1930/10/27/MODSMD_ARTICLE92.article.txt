# MODERN MORALS DUE TO INCREASED PRESENT ACTIVITY
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 2G. I
Many investigators declare that the |
world is not necessarily worse than
it has ever been before, bvit that .
modern life has stimulated a greater ]
percentage of persons into some
form of activity than have possibly 1
been thus affected in previous eras, j
This stimulation, according to
Chief of Police William J. Quinn,
has resulted in ''the apparently fixed
belief of a majority of our young i
people that high living and excite
ment are theirs by inheritance with
out the necessity of actual work." 5
"The young people of today," i
Chief Quinr. says, "just out of school |
and college, want clothes, speedy [
machines, theatres, cabarets, joy
Tidies, vacations, dances, untram- j
meled companionship with the op
posite sex; and they want all this ;
without expending any energy or j
assuming any responsibility.
"When one has youth and courage
and an appetite for pleasures, lei
gitimate or banned, he or she is just
about liable to take any and every
chance to secure the thing or things
desired." Hence, a great portion of
the modern crime problem, as one
observer phrased it, is "the quest
of modern youth for an unholy
grail."
