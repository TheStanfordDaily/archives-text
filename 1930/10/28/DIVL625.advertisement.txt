We feel that our hundreds of thousands of customers
£
throughout the State of California and the adjacent states J
: are entitled to a knowledge of our merchandising policies j
under present market and psychological conditions. <
► 3
| The policy of Roos Bros, alv/ays has been one of giving to
J the customer only high class merchandise — style right —
: which meets with the rigid quality specifications demanded :
by Roos Bros. This policy still is in force and there is no
contemplation on the part of the managemen-t of changing it. j
J In the trade the present conditions are known as a "buyer's j
: market"—which means that merchandise can be purchased, :
► • • • • *
112 and is now being purchased, .at lower prices than heretofore.
Roos Bros, has not changed its established price lines, and J
► 4
: has not in any way cheapened its standard of merchandise j
J or attempted to sell to the customer an inferior quality. But
Roos Bros, has taken advantage of this "buyer's market" to
112 give to its customers values that a year ago would have sold
at from 6.4% to 33.3% higher, depending on the commodity. :
[ ... *
It always will be Roos Bros.' policy to sell quality merchan
dise at a fair profit to itself and to give to its customers
absolutely the most in value that can be obtained for the
price which the customer desires to pay. :

Roos Bros, will not be undersold on merchandise of like
quality, but will not compete in a price market where no con
sideration is given to quality or to standards. :
We feel that our customers are entitled at a time like this j
to the knowledge and facts concerning our merchandising
policy.
