# MUSSOLINI SEES FUTURE EUROPE TO BE FASCIST
## II Duce Speaks To Large Crowd From Balcony Of Venezia Palace PREDICTS GREAT ARMY 
### 
ROME, Oct. 27 (#>).—Premier
Mussolini, in an address today, called
upon the Fascist party for a harden
ing of policy against its foes in Italy
and beyond her borders and pre
dicted a wholly Fascist Europe with
in two decades.
He spoke in Venezia Palace to the
Fascist, Council, on the eve of the
eighth anniversary of the Fascist
March on Rome.
The Duce said that having "un
masked" this hypocritical Europe,
which talks peace at Geneva and
prepares for war at home, his legions
never the less would continue to
combat all antagonisms and expel
their enemies until none remain.
The Premier declared that the
doctrines and ideas of Fascism had
become world wide, but that the op
position forces were centering their
attack politically upon Italy. He
called this "moral opposition" and
asserted it was but preparation for
military war.
Great Army
Mussolini said that in 1932, upon
the tenth anniversary of the march
on Rome, the "greatest armed
gathering Rome has seen in its 3,000
years of history" would mark that
anniversary.
He declared fifty battalions of
Fascists with 50,000 young Fascists,
90,000 standard bearers of 9,000 com
bat groups would gather in the capi
tal and that other great meetings
would be held in Milan, Perugia and
Naples.
Scores Giurati
The Duce charged Giovanni Giu
rati, whom he recently appointed to
succeed Augusto Turati as secretary
of the Fascist party, with the "puri
fication" of Italian Fascism, saying:
"You must be lenient only to the
Black Shirts whose service, ante
dates 1922; to comrades who are
ready to risk their lives for Fasc
ism—not to the heroes of the sixth
day, who have come to Fascism now
that the time of tempest is past, and
who are capable of cutting the cord
it such time returns."
While the Duce was speaking in
the palace a large crowd gathered,
filling the square and shouting for
him. He appeared on a balcony and
responded with the Roman salute.

ROME, Oct. 27 (#>).—Premier
Mussolini, in an address today, called
upon the Fascist party for a harden
ing of policy against its foes in Italy
and beyond her borders and pre
dicted a wholly Fascist Europe with
in two decades.
He spoke in Venezia Palace to the
Fascist, Council, on the eve of the
eighth anniversary of the Fascist
March on Rome.
The Duce said that having "un
masked" this hypocritical Europe,
which talks peace at Geneva and
prepares for war at home, his legions
never the less would continue to
combat all antagonisms and expel
their enemies until none remain.
The Premier declared that the
doctrines and ideas of Fascism had
become world wide, but that the op
position forces were centering their
attack politically upon Italy. He
called this "moral opposition" and
asserted it was but preparation for
military war.
Great Army
Mussolini said that in 1932, upon
the tenth anniversary of the march
on Rome, the "greatest armed
gathering Rome has seen in its 3,000
years of history" would mark that
anniversary.
He declared fifty battalions of
Fascists with 50,000 young Fascists,
90,000 standard bearers of 9,000 com
bat groups would gather in the capi
tal and that other great meetings
would be held in Milan, Perugia and
Naples.
Scores Giurati
The Duce charged Giovanni Giu
rati, whom he recently appointed to
succeed Augusto Turati as secretary
of the Fascist party, with the "puri
fication" of Italian Fascism, saying:
"You must be lenient only to the
Black Shirts whose service, ante
dates 1922; to comrades who are
ready to risk their lives for Fasc
ism—not to the heroes of the sixth
day, who have come to Fascism now
that the time of tempest is past, and
who are capable of cutting the cord
it such time returns."
