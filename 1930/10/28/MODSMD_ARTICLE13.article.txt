# THREE LEADERS PREDICT FINISH OF NAVAL RACE
## London Pact Ratification Marked By Speeches From Sea Powers 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 27. (/P)â€”The end
of competition between nations in
naval construction was foreseen yes
terday by President Hoover, Prime
Minister Mac Donald of Great Bri
tain, and Premier Hamaguchi of
Japan in a world-wide broadcast
marking the beginning of effective
ness of the London naval treaty.
The three spoke from the capitals
of the signatory powers shortly af
ter the instruments of ratification
had been deposited in London.
Hope For Signers
Asserting that the treaty, which
for the first time binds three major
naval powers to limitation of all
types of fighting vessels, marked a
step forward in international cor
diality, the three spokesmen of
their countries expressed hope that
France and Italy, which left the
London conference after they were
unable to agree upon a tonnage ra
tio, soon would join in signing the
pact.
"Relinquishment of competitive
building among the three great na
val powers, with its consequent con
tributions to the security of the
world, is the greatest significance
of this treaty," President Hoover
said.
Sees Guarantee
"If the limitations now estab
lished can be maintained we may
look forward with assurance to the
fact that future conferences will find
it easier to bring about further steps
in reduction. . . . Never again must
a race in naval armaments be al
lowed to develop."
The treaty was described by the
President as "fair to all and dan
gerous to none," and substituting
mutual trust, good will, and confi
dence for suspicion and competition.
