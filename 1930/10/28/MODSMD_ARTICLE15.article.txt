# RALLY COMMITTEE PLANS U.W. STUNTS
## 
### 
Plans for the Washington game
stunts oeeupied most of the discus
sion at the regular meeting of the
Rally Committee last night, and a
hat stunts was definitely decided
upon for one of the rooting section
features between the halves.
The Big Game Rally was voted to
be held at the Stadium or near the
bonfire rather than in the Pavilion.
The committee requests ideas for
Big Game rooting stunts, especially
on an axe motif.
