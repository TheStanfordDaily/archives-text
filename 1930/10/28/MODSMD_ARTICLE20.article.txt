The second issue of "Hesperian,"
a literary and critical publication
recently founded by James D. Hart,

to Hart. It is to have an entirely
new style of typography, with a
striking cover by Ray Boynton.
Among the contents of the coming
issue is an article by Theodore
Dreiser entitled "Mooney and Amer
ica" in which this prominent author
surveys the indifference of the
American public to any ill which
does not directly concern it. Four
translations from French poets are
rendered by Yvor Winters, a well
known modern poet who is at pres
ent teaching at Stanford.
An article on the architectural
revolution for simplicity is treated
by Emily Joseph. A section on book
collecting, to be a regular feature,
occupies four pages. A short story
by Clarkson Crane, an article by
Oscar Lewis on "Frank Norris and
the California Environment," and
poetry by Elsa Gidlow, Bunichi
Kagawa, and others are interesting
features. The art work consists of
reproductions of the work of Peter
Krasnow and Jacques Schnier.
