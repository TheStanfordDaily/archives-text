# CARD CHESS TEAM LOSES TO U.C. MEN
## 
### 
In holding the strong California
pawn pushers to a narrow victory
at Berkeley last Friday night the
inexperienced Cardinal team showed
promise of futuie strength.
Winning the last four boards after
dropping two and tieing one, the
Blue and Gold aggregation came
from behind to win 4'/2 to 2 , /->. The
work of Winston Strong, Ed Fisher,
and Angelo May was outstanding
for the Cards. Stanford's next chess
engagement is with the Castle Chess
Club of Oakland, who last year
edged out a victory over California.
