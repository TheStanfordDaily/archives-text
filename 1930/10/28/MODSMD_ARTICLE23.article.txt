# FIFTEEN CITIES PLAN TO HELP JOBLESS MEN
## Col. Woods Believes Idle Should Be Given Jobs Instead Of Bread 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 27 </P).â€”Pro
grams to combat unemployment al
ready undertaken by fifteen large
cities were held up today as models
for the rest of the country by
Colonel Arthur Woods, chairman of
the President's emergency commit
tee.
Woods urged other cities to study
the programs already worked out by
New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleve
land, Pittsburgh, Toledo, Salt Lake
City, Flint, Mich.; St. Paul, Seattle,
Milwaukee and Hartford, Conn., in
the belief that they might find in
one of them the plan that would
best meet local conditions.
The outstanding feature of the
programs he outlined was the prin
ciple that the unemployed man
should be given a job instead of
merely a loaf of bread.
Until the time that every man
competent to work has a job there
must be relief, lie said, but the real
problem is "to find the job. He sug
gested that it ought to be a job that
really needs to be done, not one that
is artificially created.
Conditions Better
Colonel Woods is not pessimistic
about the outlook. He believes con
ditions are better now, taking the
country as a whole, than they were
in 1921, when he headed President
Harding's employment commission.
But in spots conditions are worse,
he believes. He considers the Mid
dle Western States, New York and
Pennsylvania to be the hardest hit.
He said that figures furnished him
in Washington showed an estimated
3,500,000 persons out of work.
"We hope to shave that figure
later," he said.
Colonel Woods continued today to
gather around him experts in vari
ous lines, many of whom helped him
in his campaigns in 1921 and 1919.
In the latter year he aided in finding
jobs for returning World War vet
erans.
