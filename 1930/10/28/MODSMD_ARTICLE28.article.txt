# Warner Plans To Shift Five From 'Regular' Lineup
## Neill, Bogue, Caglieri, Rothert, And Taylor To Be Replaced By Colvin, Grey, Caddel, Simkins, And Marks; Few "Regulars" Out LETHARGIC PLAYING GIVEN AS REASON BY COACH 
### LEN KULLMANN 
SHUFFLING the Cards in his mind over the week-end, Pop Warner
announced last night that several new members would be found on
the Stanford first string for the immediate future at least. Dissatisfied
with the showing of many of the men whose playing has been lethargic,
Warner plans to put Don Colvin for Neill, George Grey for Bogue, Ernie
Caddel for Caglieri, Bill Simkins for Rothert, and Bill Marks for Taylor,
in as regulars.
The Cardinal mentor has been displeased with the lack of improvement
in the play of the men benched, and upon the basis of the showing made

S'by these comparatively new men in
the U.S.C. game, feels that they are
entitled to play on the first string.
Few Out
With the exception of Harry Hill
man, Ray Hulen, and Phil Moffat),
none of the players who saw ser
vice Saturday were out for practice
last night. While Hillman and Hulen
were in moleskins, they occupied
themselves in leisurely fashion toss
ing a football about.
But it was an eventful evening
; for the third and fourth string men.
| After a half-hour scrimmage among
themselves, the imported Gray men
trotted on the tield for an hour's
active session. The Grays obtained
i a moral victory by holding the var
sity reserves to a scoreless tie.
Three Shine
Ted Kite, "Red" Targhetta, and
Tom Lambert proved to be decidcd
thorns in the sides of the third
string offense in the pre-Gray meet
ing. Kite at guard and Targhetta at.
, tackle smeared numerous shots at
the line before they were well under
way, and Lambert came up with
deadly tackles whenever a nose
showed through the pick-up for
ward wall in front of him.
While the luckless Grays and sub
varsity men scrimmaged far from
the incandescents, agile newspaper
scribes monopolozized the bright
lights, as they have a habit of doing.
Showing that they had fully re
cuperated from the post-game cele
; bration, numerous campus corres
| pondents took a long workout.
Grace Kicks
Proving that all the cocoanuts do
not come from Hawaii, Bill Grace
of the S.F. News removed his bro
gans and booted the pigskin with
bare tootsies as spectators gasped.
Burnell Gould scintillated with un
| erring drop-kicks which split the
uprights time after time, although
the Tribune correspondent's forward
passing was woefully weak.
Jernegan of the Chronicle took a
light workout under wraps, confin
ing his activities to short, bullet
passes, while Dwight Bentel of the
San Jose Mercury-Herald tossed
long spirals across the field which
were the envy of all beholders. Tom
Irwin of the Examiner and Dick
Friendlich of the A.P. were both
present in spirit.
Your humble correspondent,
muchly abashed by the presence of
i such gifted men, occupied himself
!in the business of chasing wild
pitches and returning successful
drop-kicks. Today better things hit
in store, for the regulars will return.
All save Mar Albcrtson, whose knee
injury will keep him out of practice
i for a while, will grace the practice
field tomorrow.
