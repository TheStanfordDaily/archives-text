# INEXCUSABLE CONSTITUTIONAL DISCREPANCIES
## 
### 
.Nominations for the regular autumn quarter election to be held
November 4. will be made tomorrow and Thursday as provided;
for in the A.S.S.I'. Constitution and not as outlined in the A.S.S.I'.'
Hv-Laws, since the two documents are not in accord.
The constitution reads: "Nominations for each election shall he
open on the Wednesday preceding the elections, and lie closed on the
evening of the following day . . ."
The by-laws read: "All nominations shall be open at 8 a.m. on;
Monday of the week preceding election and shall be closed at 6 p.m. j
on Thursday . . . bach nomination must have eight signatures to
be valid."
This is but one of the many discrepancies existing in thc (
\.S.S.I*, constitution and by-laws, even after the revision of last
year. So glaring are some of the errors and contradictions in the
instrument under which Stanford students are governed, it seems
impossible anyone could have read the revised constitution as pre-1
sented to the students last spring quarter and as accepted by them, i
So numerous are the discrepancies appearing in the constitution j
(printed in the 1930-31 breshman Handbook) that all campus or
ganizations governed by the constitution will do well to examine
the particular provisions concerning their groups. If errors are â€¢
found, suggestions concerning their correction should be sent im
mediately to Tom I 'ike. A,S.S.I*, president, or to the Executive)
< ommittee.
The Executive Committee has the power to revise the by-laws.
Such inconsistencies as that concerning nominations should be cor
reeled at once. As for the constitution proper, a committee should I
be appointed to check it carefully and. if necessary, prepare a re-J
vised constitution which will not require correction within the next
quarter. A revised constitution would have to be considered at
special A.S.S.I', election.
Stanford student government has proceeded too long already
under an imperfect constitution. Another farcical revision such as '
that which gave the A.S.S.I*. its present constitution would he in-'
excusable.
