# RAH! RAH! SUBSIDIZATION
## 
### 
\nother contribution, thi< time from a disinterested party, has :
been added to the already large mass of material concerning the
subsidization of college athletics. This latest statement, proposing!
the official recognition of subsidization, comes from Dr. ITederick
\\ . I lawley. president of I'ark ( ollege. of I'arkville, Missouri.
I 'ark ( ollege does not engage in intercollegiate sports.
Ihe rules. Dr. I lawley declared, in commenting on the quali
fied expulsion of the I niversity of Kansas from Dig Six confer
ence sports October 25, "are untenable, cannot be enforced, and
should be abolished.
Subsidization, which exists now, should be openly recognized
and controlled.
I >r. 11 aw ley s proposal, though not original, is interesting. Imag
ine w hat fun it would be tor various of our leading universities to j
engage in competitive bidding for promising prep school athletes.
Shrewd business methods on the part of certain of these prospective I
collegians might enable them to finance not only their own univer
sity educations but also those ot their brothers and sisters.
Some ot the better of these athletes might even have managers j
to handle their contracts'. And then, too, supposing their triple-,
threat playing on the gridiron slumps a bit. their alma maters might
offer their contracts tor sale, selling them to other colleges in the'
same manner as professional baseball players are sold.
Dr. If aw ley seems to be convinced that subsidization does ex-J
ist. Supposing that it does, in a limited way, what could be gained
by open recognition of it? If subsidization cannot be controlled |
now when it has no official sanction, what chance would there be of
regulating it after universities had declared themselves as favor-'
ing it?
Subsidization 01 college athletics is not as common as Dr.
I lawley would have us believe. < kvasional instances of it have ap- j
peared in recent years; they have been dealt with severely bv the
control l>odies in charge. The University of lowa and the Uni
versity of Kansas, both of which were penalized by their respec
tive conferences for violation of rules concerning subsidization of
athletics, furnish striking evidence that such rules can be and are
being enforced.

athletics, furnish striking evidence that such rules can be and are
being enforced.
\nother contribution, thi< time from a disinterested party, has :
been added to the already large mass of material concerning the
subsidization of college athletics. This latest statement, proposing!
the official recognition of subsidization, comes from Dr. ITederick

I 'ark ( ollege does not engage in intercollegiate sports.
Ihe rules. Dr. I lawley declared, in commenting on the quali
fied expulsion of the I niversity of Kansas from Dig Six confer
ence sports October 25, "are untenable, cannot be enforced, and
should be abolished.
Subsidization, which exists now, should be openly recognized
and controlled.
I >r. 11 aw ley s proposal, though not original, is interesting. Imag
ine w hat fun it would be tor various of our leading universities to j
engage in competitive bidding for promising prep school athletes.
Shrewd business methods on the part of certain of these prospective I
collegians might enable them to finance not only their own univer
sity educations but also those ot their brothers and sisters.
Some ot the better of these athletes might even have managers j
to handle their contracts'. And then, too, supposing their triple-,
threat playing on the gridiron slumps a bit. their alma maters might
offer their contracts tor sale, selling them to other colleges in the'
same manner as professional baseball players are sold.
Dr. If aw ley seems to be convinced that subsidization does ex-J
ist. Supposing that it does, in a limited way, what could be gained
by open recognition of it? If subsidization cannot be controlled |
now when it has no official sanction, what chance would there be of
regulating it after universities had declared themselves as favor-'
ing it?
Subsidization 01 college athletics is not as common as Dr.
