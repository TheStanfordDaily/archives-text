HE DONE HER WRONG. By Milt
Gross. Doubleday, Do ran & Co.,
Inc. 1930. $2.00.
Someone or other wrote, drew,
cut — what-have-you — a woodcut
novel, "God's Man."
This burlesque of ''God's Man" by
the author of "Nize Baby" advertises
itself as "The great American novel
and not a word in it." And then as
a further inducement—"No music,
too."
From the cover blurb:
"His mad humor, eccentric, side
splitting—and wise with a complete
sophistication and an uncanny
knowledge of humanity, has become
a national possession. With drawing
board and typewriter he has evolved
a new school of humor—hard, glit
tering, and thoroughly human."
We are inclined to believe it.
Again from the cover:
"From the snowy woods of the
great Northwest to the gilded pent
houses of that modern Babylon, New
York; from rags to riches, through
every motion that made plays from
'Bessie, the Sewing Machine Girl'
to the latest Broadway shocker, and
books from 'David Harum' to the
newest ex-production successful,
'He Done Her Wrong' dashes its
pictured way, leaving a train of
laughter at its highest—a book you
can't afford to miss."
No use trying to outrave the blurb
artist—especially when he's right.

MR. PIM. By A. A. Milne; Dutton,
New York. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Novelized from Milne's most suc
cessful play this charming book
leads like a bit of foolery concocted
by .Robert Benchley or, rather bet
ter, a bit of foolery concocted by
Alan Alexander Milne.
Mr. Pim, a passer-by, brings havoc
in casual mention of A husband
thought dead years since. This, in
a staid English country house, is
rather like Mencken or Nathan in

• church. However, by the time some
two hundred pages have passed—
during which Milne's quiet but
highly effective wit has constantly
amused —the husband is discoverd
to be a mistaken identity and, the
way paved for the marriage of a
pair of charming but flustered
lovers despite protestations of a
grumpy guardian, the tale ends
quite as it ought.
A pleasant further insight into the
thoughts of the characters who so
entertain us whenever Mr. Pim
Passes By. —J. S. S.
COLOSSUS. By Holworthy Hall.
Sears. New York, 1930.
Not so many moons ago a certain
Carnegie report laid claim to a niche
in the hall of fame, raising quite a
stink concerning the condition of
athletics in our collegiate institu
tions. Evidently inspired by the re
port or possibly by beliefs of his
own, Holworthy Hall built a novel
aijpund this theme, and along with
it he expresses his observations of
college life.
The big and handsome football
hero, with whom this story concerns
itself, is nicknamed Colossus by one
of his many feminine admirers. (Put
Colossus, called Bryan Stinson by
his professors, inwardly knows he
does not deserve that appellation.
Taken from a professional team by
a rich alumnus, he is secretly paid
play football for Olympic College.
But Colossus has a conscience, you
see. That makes the story.
Bound up with this plot are all
the affaires d'amour, the college
politics, and all the rest of those in
teresting items that go to make up
the college novel.
"Colossus," nevertheles, is well
above the average for such stories.
It moves rapidly, holds the interest,
and is fairly convincing. Each situa
tion could have happened on a uni
versity campus—probably has hap
pened. All put into one novel they
seem exaggerated. Yet, why not?
It is a story, after all. —R. L.
