# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
There's nothing to do but growl
and yawn, today. Nothing's had time
or energy to happen. Everyone is re
cuperating. sleeping, and offering
alibis for defeat.
Whether a team wins or loses, the
ultimate effect on its supporters is
just the same. If you win, you stage
a big celebration. If you lose, you
drown your sorrows. As the result
of either or both, you are practically
useless before the rest of the world
for days and days. What's the dif
ference? or, why not lose and have
a good excuse for appearing help
less?
One thing we're certain ought
to be done, be lore another game
is totally ruined. Someone
should sue the people responsi
ble for all the sky-writing above
the Stadium, Saturday. No won
der the fellows spent so much
time lying on their backs on the
turf, and gazing upward . . .

Naturally, they ail believe in
signs, and don't want to miss
anything.
Another aftermath of the game is
an increase in mail from the folks
back homeâ€”Fathers who thought
sons were attending a school that
plays championship football always;
brothers who planned to follow
brothers' footsteps, boasted to their
friends, and now are beginning to
look at other schools' requirements;
and most especially, friends who
"took a tip from a man who knows"
and now feels reproachful (and hor
ribly in debt).
And now we're told the team
is practicing for its night game
in Los Angeles this week-end.
We'll hope that this Southern
outfit still has the original fear
of a Boguey man in (he dark.
At any rate, getting used to work
ing under those glaring white lights
is the first step to Hollywood. The
team has a future! The team has a
future! Somebody write a theme
song_ (to be played by the U.C.LA.
band, at the half).
