# LOOKING AROUND

Twenty-five tickets to the Junior
Prom will be given to the winners
of the roller-skate contest at Cali
fornia. .
And too many dancers think they
are in a skating rink at all times.
When one of these whizzing pairs
come our way, we fear for our own
physical well-being.
Heavy assignments and a sophis
ticated cheering section are said to
have caused the breakdown of the
yell leader at Occidental College.
Evidently the moderns at
"Oxy" have not yet learned that
it is quite as sophisticated to
"lose onself with the mob" and
yell than not to yell at all.
They are always doing new things
down at U.S.C. During a recent
football celebration the chimes of
the Philosophy Hall were made to
play popular tunes.
It seems sacrilegious enough to
have chimes play popular tunes but
having chimes in a philosophy hall
play modern melodies is beyond
comprehension.
The students at Cambridge have
inaugurated a new week-end pas
time. It is called the "Sunday Ser
mon Sweepstakes." It consists in
mass betting on the length of the
Sunday. sermons of the local pas
tors.
The plan is excellent, but just
think how long one has to wait
before knowing the results.
When the University of Chicago
recently played the University of
Florida, the captain of the latter
team gave the captain of the former
a young alligator.
It is suggested that Stanford
play Michigan. Then they can
give us a new Ford and the
Cards can reciprocate with a
dozen California oranges.
Enthusiasm is a wonderful
thing. When Washington State
beat S.C., they described the
act in gigantic headlines with
"STATERS FLEECE TROJANS."
If a 7 to 6 victory is a "fleece,"
well you know the rest.
Johnston C. Smith University
modestly states that they have the
best equipped football team in in
tercollegiate history. S.C. better
watch out.
