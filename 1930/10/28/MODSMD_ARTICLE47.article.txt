# CAMPUS OPINION
## LISTEN TO AN EXPERT ON EXPERTS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that Monday's
column of sophomorisms on "Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh" is the final proof
that dramatic criticism is a field for
experts and should be taken away
from cub writers and given to a
competent senior or at least to one
who qualifies by experience as capa
ble of good judgment and careful
composition. Why say anything
about a character unless his work
is good or badâ€”the cast is on the
program. That is a rule for criticism.
The play review was poorly (or
ganized and poorly written; it
| showed amateurism in every
line ....
The direction was excellently con
; ceived in its emphasis on fine points

of drama and bumor and a careful
passing over of the off-color incident
in the play. Miss Keho's stage posi
tions were well planned, as were
her leg and arm movements, as
when she crossed her legs when
alone and sat straight and grace
fully when with others.
Joe Thompson's entrance, back to
audience, was chosen for a laugh.
Foot, hand, and body positions of
all the cast were in character and
showed hours of work and thought.
Those 2 to 4 o'clock hours of per
sonal direction by Mr. Helvenston
gave good fruits in a smooth pro
duction.
The incident of the little pig in
the third act would undoubtedly
have pleased the author as it did
the audience.
Mr. Stover's set was conservative
ly satisfying in that it created an
ideal atmosphere for the story.
The play itself was well chosen to
round out the Pygmalion-Broadway
cycle and lent itself admirably to
Stanford talent and an appreciative
audience.
