WHAT A SPECTACLE!
Before the game started Saturday,
the big Stanford banner .above the
press box came loose and hung
hopelessly down on one side. After
the game, Stanford's colors trailed
hopelessly on i.ll sides.
Overheard on the way out: "Ahhh
—I think it was all Pup Warner's
fault." What did they expect Pop
to do? Go out there and make the
lackles for the team? But the Old
Fox iias been through the mill be
fore, and the arrows of the bleacher
coaches should not bother him.
Once again they are saying that
shifting teams cause Warner trou
ble. If by shifting Saturday the Tro
jans were able to block better, o.k,
But what assurance is there that
shifting improves blocking? As we
saw the game, it was the perfect ,
blocking of the Trojans plus the in- 1
ability of the Cardinals to either
block themselves or to escape when
they were taken out of the play
that caused all the trouble.
Southern California supporters
left the goal posts behind. Several
ambitious gentlemen contemplated
the uprights with a covetous eye,
but when the Trojan yell-leader re
minded them that only U.C, and
U.C.L.A. students were unsports
manlike enough to deface an ath
letic field, the idea evaporated.
Individually, all of the Redshirts
on the field were fighting as hard
as they could. Collectively, they
looked helpless beside the machine
like precision of the Trojan team, i
Jones succeeded in bringing his men
to a peak; Warner was not prepared
as Jones was for the clash which 1
came Saturday.
Jones teaches specialization. Each
of his men in the hackfield has one j
task to perform, and it is easier to
learn to do one thing well than to j
learn to do many things well. Con- j
scqucntly, the Trojan offense clicked j
because it was simple to learn, al- j
though hard to stop.
We have not lost faith in Warner's j
Sysiom of offense. We have seen it
work, and we know what it can
do. But it is a harder task for the
men to execute the Warner plays 1
than it is for them to execute the
plays Jones exhibited, for there is
more need for timing, perfect ball
handling, and the like.
Because of its intricacy, Warner's
plays take longer to perfect. Once
perfected, they are unstoppable. Im- j
perfect, a team looks hopeless try
ing to gain ground with reverses
and the rest of the tricks. And so
wo say that the U.S.C. game comes
too early in the Stanford schedule
for the Cards to be right.
How many games has Stanford
lost in the latter part of the season?
How many big contests has she won
by lop-.sided scores? Except for the
Santa Clara contests (and we main
tain that Stanford has outplayed the
Broncos in those games) Pop has
not dropped a contest worthy of
mention in the last half of the sea
son since he took over the Stanford
varsity.
The Big Red Machine falls apart
A\iien it meets too tough early-sea
son opposition. That lias been
proven often enough. But when the
Big Red Machine once functions, it
steamrollers all opposition. That,
too, has been proven. The conclusion
is obvious.
Then play U.S.C. when the Stan
ford offense has had time to perfect
its plays. Play U.S.C. not in the first
half of the schedule, but in the last
half when the team is nearing per
fection. Given the chance to perfect '
the Warner system, we are confi
dent that Stanford can take the Tro
jans. —L. K., Jr.
