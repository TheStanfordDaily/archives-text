# Soccer Varsity To Play San Jose State Today
## CARDINAL ELEVEN FAVORED TO BEAT VISITING PLAYERS Today's Game Is Redshirts' Second Conference Encounter 
### 
Their first victory of the season
looms as the prize for the Stanford
varsity soccer men in the game with
San Jose State here this afternoon
at 4 o'clock.
Coach Harry lVlaloney's eleven has
taken on three strong teams in suc
cession up to this point in the prac
tice season, and, having gained
valuable experience in these con
tests, is favored to click against the
Sail Jose boys.
The Cards put in some good hard
work yesterday afternoon in prac
tice. They had a long scrimmage
with the freshman aggregation and
looked good in piling up four goals
in a short space of time.
Improved Offense
Offensively the varsity showed
considerable improvement, particu
larly in the passing of the forwards.
At times, however, they lost their
aim for the goal and failed to cash
in on several good chances to score.
There were no real threats by the
frosh to test the defense, but no
doubts are felt about that depart
ment after the splendid exhibitions
of goal guarding seoji in the early
games.
Loss of Taylor, star center half
back, is expected to weaken San
Jose considerably. He was the prime
factor in the Slitters' win over the
Card freshmen last week. It was
discovered after that game that he
has been playing for the Rovers this
year, which, under the rules, makes
him ineligible for college competi
tion.
State 's Weak
Even with Taylor in the lineup,
however, the vailey team would
hardly figure to win, for they have
not shown any form to equal that
of the Redshirts. Defeats by the
California freshmen and San Mateo
Junior College indicate that they
can boast no great strength.
The game today will be Stanford's
second start in the California Inter
collegiate Soccer Conference sched
ule, and the Cards intend to launch
a campaign for the championship.
They lost their first league tilt to
San Mateo 1-2, but they have shown
improvement since and will be able
to tie for the title if they win the
rest of their games. Another game
is scheduled with San Mateo which
will give Maloney's men a chance
for revenge.

improvement since and will be able
to tie for the title if they win the
rest of their games. Another game
is scheduled with San Mateo which
will give Maloney's men a chance
for revenge.
Their first victory of the season
looms as the prize for the Stanford
varsity soccer men in the game with
San Jose State here this afternoon
at 4 o'clock.
Coach Harry lVlaloney's eleven has
taken on three strong teams in suc
cession up to this point in the prac
tice season, and, having gained
valuable experience in these con
tests, is favored to click against the
Sail Jose boys.
The Cards put in some good hard
work yesterday afternoon in prac
tice. They had a long scrimmage
with the freshman aggregation and
looked good in piling up four goals
in a short space of time.
Improved Offense
Offensively the varsity showed
considerable improvement, particu
larly in the passing of the forwards.
At times, however, they lost their
aim for the goal and failed to cash
in on several good chances to score.
There were no real threats by the
frosh to test the defense, but no
doubts are felt about that depart
ment after the splendid exhibitions
of goal guarding seoji in the early
games.
Loss of Taylor, star center half
back, is expected to weaken San
Jose considerably. He was the prime
factor in the Slitters' win over the
Card freshmen last week. It was
discovered after that game that he
has been playing for the Rovers this
year, which, under the rules, makes
him ineligible for college competi
tion.
State 's Weak
Even with Taylor in the lineup,
however, the vailey team would
hardly figure to win, for they have
not shown any form to equal that
of the Redshirts. Defeats by the
California freshmen and San Mateo
Junior College indicate that they
can boast no great strength.
The game today will be Stanford's
second start in the California Inter
collegiate Soccer Conference sched
ule, and the Cards intend to launch
a campaign for the championship.
They lost their first league tilt to
San Mateo 1-2, but they have shown
improvement since and will be able
to tie for the title if they win the
rest of their games. Another game
is scheduled with San Mateo which
will give Maloney's men a chance
