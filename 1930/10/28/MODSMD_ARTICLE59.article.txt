# COACH ELLINGTON PREDICTS VICTOR! FOR TRACK TEAM
## Dyer Shines In Practice Meets; "Dink" Wants Weight Men 
### 
"We'll clean 'em in track!"
Thus spoke Bill Ellington, chief
lieutenant of "Dink" Templeton, as
he watched the Cardinal spikemen
go through their paces yesterday
afternoon. He was referring, of
course, to a certain institution in
the southern pjirt of the state.
Not the least of Ellington's rea-
I sons for making such an emphatic
statement is "Hoc" Dyer. The blond
sprint flash seems due for his great
est season. In hi.- first race of the
year Friday he traversed the 100-
yard event in 9.9 seconds, the first
time even time has been shaded on
the Stanford oval this season.
Such time is unusual for this time
of year, and it:'s more so when it
is considered that Dyer has only
worked out a Jew times since the
University opened, being bothered
by poison oak.
Ellington believes that one thing
that accounts for Hec's burst of
speed Friday is a new arm action.
About even with Lom'oardi and
'• Hables at the 75-yard mark, he sud
denly spurted into the lead to win
by an easy two yards. It was at that
point he changed his arm move
ment.
Dyer is not the only sprinter who
is expected to garner points from
U.S.C., however. There is Les Ha
bles, the King City flash, Lombardi,
Case, a newcomer from the south,
and Howell. Howell is out with a
strained muscle, but is expected to
i be in shape next quarter.
' Other causes for cheer are the
hurdles. Captain "Podge" Smith
looked great in every race this sea
son, and the way Borton, his under
study, is improving is being watched
with interest. He topped the 70-
yard high sticks in 9.3 seconds Fri
day.
Several weeks ago Templeton re
marked, "With some decent weight
men, we'll beat U.S.C. this year."
With seven fine weight men, now
out for football, due to report for
track duty this winter, there is cer
tainly reason to believe last Satur

day's gridiron affair will be attoned
for on the ova! next spring.

denly spurted into the lead to win
by an easy two yards. It was at that
point he changed his arm move
ment.
Dyer is not the only sprinter who
is expected to garner points from
U.S.C., however. There is Les Ha
bles, the King City flash, Lombardi,
Case, a newcomer from the south,
and Howell. Howell is out with a
strained muscle, but is expected to
i be in shape next quarter.
' Other causes for cheer are the
hurdles. Captain "Podge" Smith
looked great in every race this sea
son, and the way Borton, his under
study, is improving is being watched
with interest. He topped the 70-
yard high sticks in 9.3 seconds Fri
day.
Several weeks ago Templeton re
marked, "With some decent weight
men, we'll beat U.S.C. this year."
With seven fine weight men, now
out for football, due to report for
track duty this winter, there is cer
tainly reason to believe last Satur

day's gridiron affair will be attoned
for on the ova! next spring.
"We'll clean 'em in track!"
Thus spoke Bill Ellington, chief
lieutenant of "Dink" Templeton, as
he watched the Cardinal spikemen
go through their paces yesterday
afternoon. He was referring, of
course, to a certain institution in
the southern pjirt of the state.
Not the least of Ellington's rea-
I sons for making such an emphatic
statement is "Hoc" Dyer. The blond
sprint flash seems due for his great
est season. In hi.- first race of the
year Friday he traversed the 100-
yard event in 9.9 seconds, the first
time even time has been shaded on
the Stanford oval this season.
Such time is unusual for this time
of year, and it:'s more so when it
is considered that Dyer has only
worked out a Jew times since the
University opened, being bothered
by poison oak.
Ellington believes that one thing
that accounts for Hec's burst of
speed Friday is a new arm action.
About even with Lom'oardi and
'• Hables at the 75-yard mark, he sud
denly spurted into the lead to win
by an easy two yards. It was at that
point he changed his arm move
ment.
