# Bunn Stresses Scientific Basis In Pre-Season Basketball Work
## 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
About this timfc of the year when
football is in the limelight, fans give
little thought to the progress of var
sity basketball, though early season
, work in the court game is of very
great importance, especially for the
1930-31 model of the Redshirt quin
tet.
Under the leadership of Coach
John W. Bunn, new Card mentor,
40 men are working hard at a new
style of basketball taught by the ex-
Kansas coach.
His style of play is new to most
of the Farm hoopsters, even the
fundamentals of shooting and pass
ing being an innovation to Cardinal
ranks. Bunn's whole system is reck
oned on a scientific basis, with the
' laws of physics playing the leading
, part.
Technique Worked On
Balance of the' players, position
and footwork in certain positions in
offensive play, and the handling of
the ball with regard to speed, height,
and angles in passing and shooting
are among the principles of Bunn's
system.
j Working solely on the offense
i since the beginning of practice, the
new Card coach is already discover
ing a weakness in his material which
; may cause him a good deal of trou
i ble when competition begins late in
December. He is as yet without
i man that has given any indication

' of being worthy of the center posi
tion.
Since Bunn builds his team
around the pivot man, he needs a
man with height fur the job. Stew
art, who was a substitute player on
the freshman squad last year, can
qualify as far as this factor is con
cerned, but he lacks the speed, ex
perience, and floor work that a Rood
offensive man should have.
Center important
Other possibilities for this import
ant berth are Folhamus from last
season s babe live, and McElwain.
These two hoopsters are both over
six ieet, but are not really tall as
far as coast conference pivot men
go. Six feet five or over is what
Bunn needs for the job, or a man at
least six ihree with exceptional
jumping ability.
The. Card coach is also handi
capped by the fact that some of his
best material is busy on the grid
j iron, and won't be on the court till
the end of the grid season. With
such a short time in which to learn
the new style of play, these re
cruits will have to work hard to
master Bunn's system.
The men working out have shown
quite an improvement in free
throws, some of them sinking 35
and 40 tries out of 50, while they
were formerly making only about
:-o.

little thought to the progress of var
sity basketball, though early season
, work in the court game is of very
great importance, especially for the
1930-31 model of the Redshirt quin
tet.
Under the leadership of Coach
John W. Bunn, new Card mentor,
40 men are working hard at a new
style of basketball taught by the ex-
Kansas coach.
His style of play is new to most
of the Farm hoopsters, even the
fundamentals of shooting and pass
ing being an innovation to Cardinal
ranks. Bunn's whole system is reck
oned on a scientific basis, with the
' laws of physics playing the leading
, part.
Technique Worked On
Balance of the' players, position
and footwork in certain positions in
offensive play, and the handling of
the ball with regard to speed, height,
and angles in passing and shooting
are among the principles of Bunn's
system.
j Working solely on the offense
i since the beginning of practice, the
new Card coach is already discover
ing a weakness in his material which
; may cause him a good deal of trou
i ble when competition begins late in
December. He is as yet without
i man that has given any indication

' of being worthy of the center posi
tion.
Since Bunn builds his team
around the pivot man, he needs a
man with height fur the job. Stew
art, who was a substitute player on
the freshman squad last year, can
qualify as far as this factor is con
cerned, but he lacks the speed, ex
perience, and floor work that a Rood
offensive man should have.
Center important
Other possibilities for this import
ant berth are Folhamus from last
season s babe live, and McElwain.
These two hoopsters are both over
six ieet, but are not really tall as
far as coast conference pivot men
go. Six feet five or over is what
Bunn needs for the job, or a man at
least six ihree with exceptional
jumping ability.
The. Card coach is also handi
capped by the fact that some of his
best material is busy on the grid
j iron, and won't be on the court till
the end of the grid season. With
such a short time in which to learn
the new style of play, these re
cruits will have to work hard to
master Bunn's system.
The men working out have shown
quite an improvement in free
throws, some of them sinking 35
and 40 tries out of 50, while they
were formerly making only about
:-o.

football is in the limelight, fans give

sity basketball, though early season
