# CLASS GRID TILTS STOPPED; '32 WINS
## 
### 
Both interclass touch football
games which were scheduled for
this afternoon have been cancelled,
according to an announcement made
by Parker Reed. Lack of interest
among the classes was given as the
reason for the cancellation.
The junior team was awarded the
championship as it was the only one
to put in an appearance for both
of its previous games. The sopho
more team, which played its second
game and was defeated by the jun
iors, 20 to 18, was given second
place. Neither the seniors nor the
freshmen appeared for either of
their games, so they received no
points in Ihe rating.
