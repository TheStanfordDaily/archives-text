# INJURIES HAMPER BABES IN TUNING FOR U.S.C. CLASH
## Card Frosh Face Trojans, Bears In Consecutive Week-End Tilts 
### 
Hard hit by injuries sustained at
the hands of the fighting Saint
Mary's freshmen last week-end, the
Card yearling gridmen are faced
with the problem of rounding into
shape for a tough tussle with the
U.S.C. babes Saturday afternoon
here in the Stadium.
Hillman suffered a wrenched
j shoulder, which will definitely de
prive the freshmen of their quar
terback in the Trojan contest, while
White, at halfback, hurt his ankle
and is bothered with a charley
horse. It is a question whether he
will be in shape for the game.
Kantzner, first string center, was
also hurt, but lie will probably be
in shape by Saturday.
Adding this list of injuries to the
first string men hurt in the Bruin
game the week-end previous, Coach
Bradshaw finds the Card chances
> against the strong Trojans rather
gloomy.
Edelcn was out of the Gael game
with a bad leg, while Tarver and
Anderson were both handicapped
by injuries.
The Trojan babes have a 27 to 0
victory over the Bear cubs to their
' credit, a team that was only downed
22 to 7 by the Saints.
Since Bradshaw has little hope
that his crippled outfit can take the
Southern California freshmen, he
will be concentrating his efforts on
getting his men in shape for the
"little big game'' with California the
following week.
The Bear cubs made a poor start
| this season, but Saturday they
I showed unexpected power to defeat
, Santa Clara 7 to 0, while the best
the Cards could do in downing the
Broncos was 7 to G.
