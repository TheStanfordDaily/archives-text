# STANFORD LIBRARY GETS SPECIMEN OF BOOKBINDER'S ART
## Unusual Book Is Product Of Local Experiment In Craft Work 
### 
The rjcent receipt by the Stanford
Library of a volume entitled
"Leaves of Grass" brought to light
the existence of a local industry of
the Old Guild type. Hazal Dreis of
San Francisco has built up an es
tablishment of bookbinding which
is one of the few craft experiments
being tried in this country.
According to Miss Dreis she and
her band of apprentices try io
eliminate the frills and much of the
slavery of modern life and at the
same time keep up with our fast
moving civilization. They are mem
bers of the National Guild of Book
Workers. Both Miss Dreis and Cob
den-Sanderson, who is doing the
same type of work in England, had
the same teacher, Lawrence de Cov
erly of Roger de Coverly Sons, Lon
don.
"Leaves of Grass" comprises all
the poems of Walt Whitman. The
binding, according to Nathan Van
Patten, librarian, is one of the most
interesting to be received by the li
brary. The cover is of veneer ma
hogany stained to harmonize with
the red leather back. Five thongs
laced directly into the board cover
give the book the semblance of an
old volume. On the lower right hand
corner of the cover is the insignia
of Random House carved by Val
enti Angelo.
The book is number 175 of four
hundred that were printed.
