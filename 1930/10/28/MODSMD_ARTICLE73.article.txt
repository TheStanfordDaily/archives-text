# STANFORD FLAG BEARERS DID AXE STUNT SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO, IN WAR PARADE
## 
### 
Stanford men have lost and re
covered more than the famous axe
from their rivals at California, ac
cording to the story of the first
American Flag to be carried over
the French front.
On April 24, 1917, four flags were
dedicated in the civic auditorium,
San Francisco, by the Friends of
France in co-operation with the
American League of California.
Twelve thousand people were pres
ent at the ceremony which marked
the leave-taking of 42 students from
the University of California and 21
from Stanford.
At the time the dedication took
place the United States had already
entered the war, but no flag had as
yet been carried to the front. The
Secretary of War gave official sanc
tion to the four flags dedicated in
San Francisco.
One of these was destined for the
First Stanford Unit in the American
Ambulance Field Service which had
left in February. Arthur Clifford

Kimber, '18, was chosen by his
classmates to take the flag to
France.
Once in New York the members
of the U.C. ambulance units met
Kimber. A parade was to be held
through the principal streets of the
city. A letter from Kimber tells the
story. "Suddenly, as I was getting
my flag ready they rushed on me.
Thirty or forty men overpowered
me, grabbed the flag, and rushed for
a taxi.
"I jumped on the running board
of a car—l don't know whose. We
picked up a policeman and he com
manded the driver to open the
throttle." The chase was on, and
the flag was eventually recovered
from the badly frightened U.C. stu
dents.
Kimber sailed for Liverpool May
7. 1917, and proceeded from there
to Ligny en Barrois where he de
livered his charge safely to the First
Unit. The famous flag is now kept
in the Memorial Church here.

in the Memorial Church here.
