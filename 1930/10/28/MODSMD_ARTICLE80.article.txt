# TALK ON MUSICAL RESPONSES GIVEN BY HENRY COLWELL
## World Experiencing Third Musical Revolution Believes Pianist 
### 
"Rules of human response to music
can only be made for a group of
people trained to listen to a certain
type of music," was the conclusion
reached by Henry Cowell in his
lecture given yesterday afternoon in
the Little Theatre on the subject of
"Changes in Response During Musi
cal History."
Cowell pointed that music has ex
perienced two great revolutions: the
first came during the Greek civiliza
tion when instrumental music was
played entirely without the Use of
the voice; the second great musical
revolution came with the introduc
tion of harmony.
Modei'n music with its so-called
dissonant chords is making the third
musical upheaval, Cowell believes.
Musical progress is possible, he
said, because people eventually ad
just themselves to new music and
there is a resulting pleasant emo
tional response.
An experience at a concert given
in Leipzig illustrates why Henry
Cowell contends that we are now in
a third period of musical revolution.
He said in part, "Many people regard
my playing as either shocking or
funny. When I played at Leipzig,
they regarded my playing as an in
sult to Mendlessohn and Bach. On
this occasion 12 students came on
the stage with the intention of at
tacking me and a riot ensued that
required the police force to quell.' ;
At the conclusion of the lecture
Cowell played several of his own
ultra-modern compositions.
