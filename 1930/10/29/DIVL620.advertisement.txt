"Let's walk"
"Oh, well .:
The Neolithic men were un
questionably a smart people.
In the heart of the Umbrella
Age they figured out that
strolling in the rain would be
fun if you only didn't get wet.
Nothing more was done about
it, though, until 1836, when
Tower started making slick
ers. We're good at it
now, if we do say it.
Fish Brand Slickers, roomy,
well-cut, long-wearing, are
sold everywhere, in a wide
range of models, weights and
colors, for men and others.
Your slicker will soon pay for
itself in reduced taxi and
pressing bills. Look for the
fish on the label. A. J. Tower
Company, 24 Simmons Street,
