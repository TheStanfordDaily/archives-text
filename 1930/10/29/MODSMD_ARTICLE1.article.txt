# HOOVER CALLS KELLEY EXPOSE BASELESS LIE
## Wilbur, Work Find Records Clean In Department Of Interior NEWSPAPERS CENSURED 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. (/P) —
President Hoover and the two of
icials who as secretary of the in
crior had supervision of the gov-

ernment's oil shale lands
spoke their minds today
in unanimous denuncia
tion of the charges by
Ralph S. Kelley, that
there had been irregu
larities in disposing of
the lands.
The President de-

cribed the charges as "fabrications'
.vithout "merit or substance' in dis
:ussing the matter at his regular
Dress conference.
. A little later the Department of
Justice, which has investigated the
dictations of the former Denver
land olfice official, made public let
ers by Secretary Wilbur and for
ner Secretary Work of the Interior.
Both asserted they had no knowl
edge of irregularities and Wilbur
described the affair as "nonsense."

President Hoover interpolated his
remarks with forceful accents. He
iserted that the charges were made
in the midst of a political campaign
in "an attempt to charge odious oil
scandals to this administration" and
said that Kellcy could have deter
mined their falsity by referring to
his own office records.
At the same time the President
said the newspaper which published
Kelley's charges apparently had
made no effort to test their truth
fulness. The President did not men
tion the paper by name.
'"As a piece of journalism it may
well be that the newspaper involved
was misled," Hoover said. "It cer
tainly does not represent the prac
tice of better American journalism.
As a piece of politics it is certainly
far below the ideals of political par
tisanship hold by substantial men
in that party.
"Baseless, Infamous Charge"
"I hope that the American people
realize," he said, "that when reck-
Icss, baseless, and infamous .charges
in the face of responsible denial
with no attempt at verification, are
supported by political agencies and
ire broadcast, reflecting upon the
probity of public men such as Sec
retary Wilbur, the ultimate result
can only be damage to public ser
vice as a whole."
Kelley, after making his charges,
submitted his resignation from the
land office, but it was refused and
he was suspended pending their in
vestigation. The Department of Jus
tice, after a study, has declared them
unfounded.
President Hoover said that out of
5,000,000 acres of government hold
ings of such lands, the administra
ion had approved old title claims
'or some 43,000 acres arising under
he mineral law prior to 1920.
"Under my orders no leases or
itles have been passed under the
lew law," the President said.

Kelley, after making his charges,
submitted his resignation from the

unfounded.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. (/P) —
President Hoover and the two of
icials who as secretary of the in
crior had supervision of the gov-

ernment's oil shale lands
spoke their minds today
in unanimous denuncia
tion of the charges by
Ralph S. Kelley, that
there had been irregu
larities in disposing of
the lands.
The President de-

cribed the charges as "fabrications'
.vithout "merit or substance' in dis
:ussing the matter at his regular
Dress conference.
. A little later the Department of
Justice, which has investigated the
dictations of the former Denver
land olfice official, made public let
ers by Secretary Wilbur and for
ner Secretary Work of the Interior.
Both asserted they had no knowl
edge of irregularities and Wilbur
described the affair as "nonsense."

President Hoover interpolated his
remarks with forceful accents. He
iserted that the charges were made
in the midst of a political campaign
in "an attempt to charge odious oil
scandals to this administration" and
said that Kellcy could have deter
mined their falsity by referring to
his own office records.
At the same time the President
said the newspaper which published
Kelley's charges apparently had
made no effort to test their truth
fulness. The President did not men
tion the paper by name.
'"As a piece of journalism it may
well be that the newspaper involved
was misled," Hoover said. "It cer
tainly does not represent the prac
tice of better American journalism.
As a piece of politics it is certainly
far below the ideals of political par
tisanship hold by substantial men
in that party.
"Baseless, Infamous Charge"
"I hope that the American people
realize," he said, "that when reck-
Icss, baseless, and infamous .charges
in the face of responsible denial
with no attempt at verification, are
supported by political agencies and
ire broadcast, reflecting upon the
probity of public men such as Sec
retary Wilbur, the ultimate result
can only be damage to public ser
