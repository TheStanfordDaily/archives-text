# NOTED PRINTER ENTHUSIASTICALLY PRAISES BEAUTIES OF STANFORD
## 
### Richard Friendlich 
As a background against which
beauty, symmetry, and color com
bine to form an ideal setting for
artistic appreciation, Stanford Uni
versity is unmatched in the United
States.
Such was the opinion of George
W. Jones, member of the Corpora
tion of the City of London, printer
by special appointment to the King
and Queen of the Belgians, and one
of the leaders of his craft, who, with
William E. Ritdge, New York printer
and publisher, was the guest of the
University yesterday.
The distinguished typographer,
who is on a combined business and
pleasure tour of the country, was
greatly impressed by the appearance
of the Stanford campus.
Standing under the Memorial
Arch, he surveyed the view of Palm
Drive with the eye of a connoisseur
of line and color.
"There," he declared as he turned

; away, "is the most beautiful sight
i your America has yet afforded me.
; In such a setting as this, it is no
wonder that you turn to art."
Shown through the University
Press, Jones praised it as an un
usually complete plant, and charac
terized its work as much above the
average. He was particuarly inter-
I ested in the Bender collection of
fine printing in the library. The
United States, he said, is a leader
in the typographical field, and the
interest, he believed, was keenest on
i the Pacific Coast.
He was signally struck by the ap
pearance of so many student-owned
cars on the campus. "At Oxford and
, Cambridge, only a small percentage
of the students own automobiles.
The universities are more compact
in structure than yours."
Jones and his party will visit the
University of California today, and
Mills College tomorrow, before pro
ceeding on their tour.
