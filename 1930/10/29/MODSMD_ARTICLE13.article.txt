GLASGOW, England. Oct 28 (/!').
â€”Viscount Cecil told a meeting of
university students today that he
very much deprecated any sugges
tion that the League of Nations could
not get on unless the United States
joined it.
"I am quite sure," he said, "that
we can attempt a great, deal of ad
mirable work and we merely are
lowering ourselves, without doing
any good, by looking over our
shoulders to sec what the United
States is doing."
