### 
Stewart Stadler was appointed
chairman of the Election Board at
the regular meeting of the Execu
tive Committee in the A.S.S.U.
Council Room of the Old Union last
night.
Eleven other students were ap
pointed to serve on the board under
Stadler: Parker Reed, Henry Grace,
Bill Best, Ernest Hatch. Alice Mc-
Creei'y, Jack Owen, Fred Fowler,
Ben Eastman, Anne Burnett, and
Eleanor Boyd.
The Election Board functions
throughout the scholastic year and
has complete charge of all student
body elections.
A motion was passed requiring the
Debate Council, the Dramatic Coun
cil, and the Rally Committee to sub
mit the full minutes of their meet
ings to the Executive Committee for
its approval.
This action was taken in order
that these minutes should be in
cluded in the student manager's an
nual report. Under the present by
laws the Publications Council is the
only chartered A.S.S.U. committee
that is required to perform this
duty.
Jack Snyder, chairman of the Vo
cational Guidance Committee, pre
sented a projected program of that
body's activities for the present
scholastic year, as worked out in
co-operation with C. Gilbert Wrenn,
secretary of the University commit
tee on vocational guidance.
Snyder requested an appropria
tion of $200 from the associated stu
dent funds, with which to carry on
their work of printing and mailing
questionnaires, publishing bibliogra
phies, and obtaining 12 speakers to
hold conferences with interested
students.
A committee was appointed to
take this request into consideration
and report on its findings at the
next meeting of the Ex Committee.
