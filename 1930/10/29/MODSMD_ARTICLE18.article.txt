# COAT, TROUSERS MATCH VEST, BUT GAMBLER FREED

OAKLAND, Oct. 28. </P>â€”
Sam Mitchell, colored, is out
of jail today because he is a
good story-teller and Police
Judge Howard L. Bacon knows
a good story when he hears
one.
Mitchell had pleaded guilty
to possession of a lottery ticket.
Then he decided a little ex
plaining wouldn't hurt matters.
"My vest was so dirty I had
to have it cleaned," he told the
judge. "I was going out and
had to have a vest, so I bor
rowed one. The ticket was in
the vest when I bororwed it."
"How do you explain the fact
the vest matches your coat and
trousers?" Judge Bacon wanted
to know.
"That's easy," Mitchell said.
"My friend and I liked the
same pattern so well we bought
suits just alike."
' That's a good story,'' Judge
Bacon decided. "Case dis
missed."
