# TUTOR FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS PROVIDED BY ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
Engineering students who encoun
ter difficulty in writing papers are
offered the aid of a special tutor
provided by the Department of
English this quarter.
The new tutoring plan conceived
hy Professor Samuel Seward and
put into efTcct. with the co-opera
tion of Dean Theodore Hoover, of
the School of Engineering, offers
engineers an opportunity to receive
valuable aid in clarifying the tech
nical expression of their subjects.
Homer Widman, graduate English
student, has been appointed tutor
and will correct papers, and give
instruction and assistance in out
lining, as well as provide references
in grammar books concerning sen
tence structure and expression. Wid
man is assistant editor of the
"Mieropaleontologist," published by
the Department of Geology and has
n thorough knowledge of technical

expression. He may be found in his
office, 5398, adjoining the R.O.T.C.
department, the major part of any
afternoon.
Professor Seward declares that
the plan places the initiative in
study upon the student rather than
upon the instructor. He declares:
"It furnishes a practical source of
aid for those who have not had
time to take a general composition
course. The student's work is not
prescribed by anyone. Instead, when
the need arises, he consults the in
structor concerning his problems
and is given advice and instruction
which specifically applies to his in
dividual case."
According to Professor Seward
the plan is at present in the experi
mental stage only. If it proves suc
cessful he is hopeful that English
tutors may ultimately be provided
in the various departments to aid
students in the writing of papers.
