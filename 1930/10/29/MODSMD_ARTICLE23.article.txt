# SHAW PAYS TRIBUTE IN RADIO TALK
## Einstein And G.B.S. Speak At Dinner In Honor Of Scientist 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 28. (/Piâ€”Two of
the most famous men in the world,
George Bernard Shaw and Profes
sor Albert Einstein, spoke and ex
changed compliments tonight at a
dinner in honor of the German sci
entist.
The soft Irish brogue of Shaw
and the sharp staccato German of
Professor Einstein were broadcast
to millions of listeners in England
and the United States.
In proposing the health of Pro
fessor Einstein, Shaw was in his
lightest vein.
"Here in London we are still a
great center. I don't suppose we
shall be a great center long. All that
will be transferred presently to the
United States. But for the moment
I am speaking in a capital where
the reception of great men is a very
common event."
Shaw proposed a toast to the sci
entist as "the greatest of our con
temporaries," placing him among
"the men who are great among
great men." Such, he said, were
Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, and
Newton, also.
Professor Einstein addressed the
guests at the banquet, organized by
the Joint British Committee for the
Promotion of the Physical and Eco
nomic Welfare of Eastern Jewry,
and urged international Jewry to
remain true to its traditions.
