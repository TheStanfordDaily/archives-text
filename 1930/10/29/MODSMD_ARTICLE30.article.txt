# WARNER'S MEN WORK OUT WITH RENEWED VIGOR
## No Rearrangement Of First String Lineup In Last Night's Practice NEILL HAS CRACKED RIB 
### Len Kullmann 
With the exception of shifting
Phil Baker from quarterback to cen
ter temporarily to fill the gap left
vacant by Perry Taylor and Mar
Albertson, last night's football prac
tice moved forward without any
rearrangement of the men.
Most noticeable at the training
session was the spirited way the
men swung into action. Renewed
determination, rather than down
cast countenances, was apparent
during the workout, and all ill-ef
fects from the Southern California
game seemed physical rather than
mental.
Four Injured
The physical losses of the Trojan
clash are not inconsiderable, how
ever. Perry Taylor and Mar Albert
son, both in the Palo Alto Hospital,
leave the burden of the center posi
tion on Bill Marks. Phil Neill, with
cracked rib, and Captain Ray
Tandy, whose knee was not im
proved by Saturday's play, watched
practice from the sidelines.
With the possible exception of
Mar Albertson, all the men should
be in shape to play against Wash
ington on November 8, according to
Doctor Fritz Roth. A few of the
squad members limped cautiously
about last night, showing the effects
of the previous day's hard scrim
mage, but on the whole the men
appeared fit.
No Shift
Allaying all rumors of rearrange
ment of the first string lineup, War
ner had the following men working
together: Bill Doub and Don Colvin,
ends; Dick Bogue and '"Chuck" Ehr
horn, tackles; "Red" Hand and Bill
Bardin, guards; Bill Marks, center;
Harry Hillman, quarterback; Har
low Rothert, fullback; Bill Moffatt,
left half; and Guido Caglieri and
Bill Clark, alternating at right half.
After a long chalk talk, punctu
ated by much laughter from the
men, Warner sent the teams over
to run plays against the dummies.
Following a half-hour workout
there, the teams ran plays beneath
the lights until well after 6 o'clock.
According to plans announced by
Don Liebendorfer, the squad will
leave tomorrow night after practice
for Los Angeles, where they will
meet the U.C.L.A. eleven Friday
night in the Cardinal's first night
game.
