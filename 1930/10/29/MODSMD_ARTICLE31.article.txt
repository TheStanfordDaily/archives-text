SEVILLE, Spain, Oct. 28 (/P).â€”
Five hundred students of the Uni
versity of Seville refused to attend
their classes today. They marched
into the School of Physiology and
forcibly ejected all of the class mem
bers.
This school was the only one that
attempted to hold sessions today.
Prof. Manuel Jimenez, of the De
partment of Civil Law, tried to pro
ceed with his schedule but had to
give up.
Gaining control of the institution
the students paraded through the
halls throwing benches down stair
ways and shouting ''Down With the
Callcjo Plan."
Police refrained from entering the
building and thus averted clashes.
It was believed the university would
suspend temporarily.
