# BOOSTING STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
Student government at Stanford is very much a reality. Through
the Executive Committee. A.S.S.L'. heads, and Men and Women
i 'ouncils the basic trinity of good government, legislative, executive,
and judicial duties, are carried on effectively and efficiently.
Two years ago the power of the councils was increased to in
( hide jurisdiction over traffic law violations by students on campus
roads. This was done as a convenience to undergraduates to pro
side them with a traffic court close at hand.
With student supervision of the traffic code, it is doubly obliga
tory that Stanford men and women acquaint themselves with the
law. and .abide by the regulations.
The entire Stanford campus from Lagunita to the State High
way. including Palm Drive, is a 20-mile /.one, with a 15 mile limit
at ;ill intersections. Driving at a faster rate is unsafe in an area
congested with traffic as is the campus. Near the Quad, postoffice,
halls. Row, and gymnasiums where great numbers of pedestrians
add to driving hazards, special care should be taken.
Each week the councils are forced to handle several dozen park
ing cases. "Xo-parking" zones are plainly marked with yellow
paint, while limited parking areas are designated with signs. Every
automobile operator should know that no parking is allowed on
pathways and other pedestrian walks.
If campus roadways are to be safe, every student must obey the
traffic regulations; strict observance of the law will be a boost for
student government.
