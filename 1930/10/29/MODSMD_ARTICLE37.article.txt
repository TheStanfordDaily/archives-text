THE GENTLEMAN IN THE PAR
LOUR. By W. Somerset Maugh
am. Doubleday Doran & Com
pany, Inc. New York, IJMO. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Very charmingly and unaffectedly
does W. Somerset Maugham in "The
Gentleman in the Parlour" describe
a journey made from Rangoon to
Haiphong, Indo-China.
It is not with any great depth of
passion or feeling of intense emo
tion that the author in this volume
views the glamourous and exotic
lands of the Orient. Rather does he,
like a tolerant and cultured neigh
bor, chat with the reader of mag
nificent temples and trivial incidents,
great races long dead and passing
native children, pleasantly observed
as he treks from Bangkok to Saigon,
from the irrawaddy to the Men-*
kong.
Maugham's style here is very like
that of Kipling's in his "From Sea
to Sea." Readers who enjoy accounts
of strange lands will find in "The
Gentleman in the Parlour" a book
that will neither strongly arouse or
deeply stir them, but which will
rather provide just the sort of lan
gourous reading for a warm and
drowsy afternoon following a hectic
week-end. —J. McG.
THIS STUBBORN ROOT and
OTHER POEMS. By Ilortense
Flexner. New York: Macmillan
& Co. IMO. (At the Stanford
Bookstore. $1.25.)
This book of verse is a restrained
expression of one who says that she
loves to see "red ink . . . across
the ledger's gray."
There is some of the rebellious
spirit which one expects of modern
poets. But it is not an impassioned
or silly fight. She simply laments,
"How tame has earth become
Under man's heavy thumb."

' There are, as !-he says, "no high
invisible banners waving above your |
words" in Miss Flexner's poems.
One suspects that much of the re
straint to be found throughout the
book is due to a genteel disillusion
ment with everything, including
poetry. She writes of poets,
"The last will doubtless make his I
little tune
And think it new—about the '
weary moon."
One mistrusts the term "pleasing"
as faint praise which may imply
damnation. But "This Stubborn
i Root" is pleasing. It is well done
throughout, it is clever and charm
ing; but it misses greatness.

CHANCES. By A. Hamilton Gibbs.
Little Brown, 1!I.'J0. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
The first part of A. Hamilton
' Gibbs's novel is an excellent and
i charming portrayal of the lives of j
two English boys, brothers, attend- j
ing a French school. Unfortunately, }
it is really only an introduction to
the book. The later theme carries
the comradeship between the two
to the inevitable break, when both j
love the same girl.
War scenes are dramatically pre- (
sented as only one who served at
the front could present them. They
substantiate impressions made by (
the play, "Journey's End," and the
picture, "All Quiet on the Western
Front."
The trouble with "Chances" seems
to be that the characters of Tom
and Jack are too finely drawn to
warrant such grievous misunder
standing. Had they been less close
to each other in their friendship, the
climax would not leave the reader
wondering what became of the two
little boys who built the "Suez
, Canal" in their garden together.

, Canal" in their garden together.
THE GENTLEMAN IN THE PAR
LOUR. By W. Somerset Maugh
am. Doubleday Doran & Com
pany, Inc. New York, IJMO. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Very charmingly and unaffectedly
does W. Somerset Maugham in "The
Gentleman in the Parlour" describe
a journey made from Rangoon to
Haiphong, Indo-China.
It is not with any great depth of
passion or feeling of intense emo
tion that the author in this volume
views the glamourous and exotic
lands of the Orient. Rather does he,
like a tolerant and cultured neigh
bor, chat with the reader of mag
nificent temples and trivial incidents,
great races long dead and passing
native children, pleasantly observed
as he treks from Bangkok to Saigon,
from the irrawaddy to the Men-*
kong.
Maugham's style here is very like
that of Kipling's in his "From Sea
to Sea." Readers who enjoy accounts
of strange lands will find in "The
Gentleman in the Parlour" a book
that will neither strongly arouse or
deeply stir them, but which will
rather provide just the sort of lan
gourous reading for a warm and
drowsy afternoon following a hectic
week-end. —J. McG.
THIS STUBBORN ROOT and
OTHER POEMS. By Ilortense
Flexner. New York: Macmillan
& Co. IMO. (At the Stanford
Bookstore. $1.25.)
This book of verse is a restrained
expression of one who says that she
loves to see "red ink . . . across
the ledger's gray."
There is some of the rebellious
spirit which one expects of modern
poets. But it is not an impassioned
or silly fight. She simply laments,
"How tame has earth become
Under man's heavy thumb."

' There are, as !-he says, "no high
invisible banners waving above your |
words" in Miss Flexner's poems.
One suspects that much of the re
straint to be found throughout the
book is due to a genteel disillusion
ment with everything, including
poetry. She writes of poets,
"The last will doubtless make his I
little tune
And think it new—about the '
weary moon."
One mistrusts the term "pleasing"
as faint praise which may imply
damnation. But "This Stubborn
i Root" is pleasing. It is well done
throughout, it is clever and charm
ing; but it misses greatness.
—E. E. W.
CHANCES. By A. Hamilton Gibbs.
Little Brown, 1!I.'J0. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
The first part of A. Hamilton
' Gibbs's novel is an excellent and
i charming portrayal of the lives of j
two English boys, brothers, attend- j
ing a French school. Unfortunately, }
it is really only an introduction to
the book. The later theme carries
the comradeship between the two
to the inevitable break, when both j
love the same girl.
War scenes are dramatically pre- (
sented as only one who served at
the front could present them. They
substantiate impressions made by (
the play, "Journey's End," and the
picture, "All Quiet on the Western
Front."
The trouble with "Chances" seems
to be that the characters of Tom
and Jack are too finely drawn to
warrant such grievous misunder
standing. Had they been less close
to each other in their friendship, the
climax would not leave the reader
wondering what became of the two
little boys who built the "Suez
, Canal" in their garden together.
