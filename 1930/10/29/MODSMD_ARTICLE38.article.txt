Never before have there been so
many habitual hummers and singers
I about the Quad, as this year. Just
now, their favorite seems to be
! "Three Little Words." Appropriate,
for this time of the month, at least,
i Our version of the song goes like
this:
"What makes the grass blue, the
sky greener, moon sparkle and
everybody happy?— Those three lit
tle words, 'Enclosed find check.'"
Only two more days till the first,
boys. Keep your courage up, sit in
the balcony, drink five-cent "cocs"
instead of ten-cent orange juices,
! smoke the girl friend's cigarettes,
| and you probably won't be put in
debtors' prison for another month, at
least.
The old order changeth—or, What's
happened to the Stanford Rough?
At the Junior Jolly-Up last night we
actually found that nineteen out of
I every forty-seven men present were
Juniors. Can't be so sure about the
women. There are never enough of
them to count, anyway . . .
BUT, also by actual census, even

j though they're outnumbered, eight
to one, at these affairs, there are
seven-and-a-half girls who can.
i really dance to each one man who
does more than walk around the
floor. Make what you will of that.
Meanwhile, ladies, we bow.
Now is the time for some
sweet maid (or two) to come to
the aid of the Danceless Party.
The Alpha Phi's used to have a
perpetual corner on the chorus
market. Are they stiil willing to
try?

Tonight's the night when all the
women of all the houses, all the
corridors of Roble, get together lor
a little well-costumed fun, at the
Conference party. All newcomers to
the Five Hundred's part of the cam
pus are politely requested to bring
complete records of their family
trees (fruit, nut, and vegetable),
past and future, record of dates to
date, preferences in clothes for Quad
or Frantic, preferences as to style
of hair dress (If she's a Kappa, she's
brunette), and anything else you'd
bring to an auction of your soul,
anywhere.
Strange costumes, weird, unrecog
nizable figures, have been seen on
the streets before and after these
l parties, in years past. So, careful,
men! Don't wipe your shoes on a
stray doormat this evening. Maybe
it's a coming debater or a Pan-Hell
president, in disguise . . .
