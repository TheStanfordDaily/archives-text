# INTERNATIONAL CLUB WILL MEET TONIGHT
## 
### 
The International Relations Club
will hold its first meeting at 7:30
o'clock tonight in the West Memorial
Library of the Political Science
Building.
Dr. Henry David Gray, last year's
Director of the American University
Union in London, will speak on the
"Present Attitude of England To
ward America." Dr. Gray is well
qualified to speak upon his subject
because of his close association with
prominent men who have figured in
the formation of Britain's foreign
policies.
