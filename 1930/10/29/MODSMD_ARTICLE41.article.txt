Women at Michigan State College
complain that smiles no longer win
rides from passing male motorists.
The cold weather must liave a
eurious eltect on men back
there. It would be safe to bet
that if a Western co-ed were to
stand on a corner and smile,
traffic would be tied up for
blocks while accommodating
men vied for the favor of the
prospective fair passenger.
' Which all to prove that the
nobility and chivalry of the old
Spanish dons still resides in Cali
fornia. Don't page Freud!
U S.C. will give its winning
1.C.4-A. track team gold spiked
track shoes. Maybe the football team
will get gold cleated shoes.
If they do, it will only prove
that it PAYS to go out for the
gridiron rather than spend time
on the track.
There is a complaint circulating
'at Washington State College that
i some students try to tell professors J
I how to run their classes.
But as long as the students don't 1
tell their professors how NOT to run |
their classesâ€”all is yet safe.
An investigation by the Uni
| versit.v of Missouri shows that
only live co-eds out of 100 have
good looking legs.
Maybe long skirts are coming back
because women realize this fact; or
perhaps they realize that curiosity
is the life of MEN.
History seems to repeat itself. Our
fathers used to sit on the library
steps for hours to catch a glimpse
of a shapely ankle. For a few years
this generation could stand on the
library steps and view knees. Soon
we will be sitting, as did our fathers.
