Friday night the Stanford var
sity makes its debut beneath the
glow of artificial lighting. Meet
ing llie University of California
at Los Angeles Bruins in the
Colosseum, the Redshirts will
enter their third Conference
game with a .50(1 rating, having
won from Oregon State and, ah,
lost to U.S.C.
Stanford's warriors will not be
completely at a loss beneath the
ineandescents, for the boys have
been practicing for upwards of a
half an hour every evening on their
own field with the aid of a new
lighting system. And that practice
should stand them in good stead
Friday.
However, the smaller relative
of California's awe-inspiring
Coldcn Bear has been making
money while the lights shine.
Finding the competition with
U.S.C. too still during Saturday
afternoons, the Bruins scheduled
their games for Friday nights
and have been drawing fair
sized crowds.
Even the rooting section stunts
have been adapted to their new en
vironment, and electric lights spell
out "UCLA" and other spectacular
sights for the edification of the
audiences. Half of the lighting sys
tem is turned out to permit per
formance of the stunts.
But climatic conditions may
handicap the Redshirts more
than the Bruins. According to
one of our undercover scouts,
a heavy dew falls in the Colos
seum at night, and after about
ten minutes of play a white
jersey is guaranteed to look ex
ceedingly sad.
One of the most encouraging fea
tures of the game is the fact that
as far as Conference records go, a
win over the Bruins counts just as
much as a win over the Trojans.
However, a loss would look about
six times worse.
According to our own ideas,
limits and passes will be harder
to judge in the great white
light, but otherwise there will
not be much difference in play
ing conditions. Since Stanford
has done best with her aerial
attack, the situation may not be
so rosy.
However, the boys will always
have an alibi if they lose. It will
have been their first game at night
and the strange surrounding may
be blamed for the downfall. Yet, all
this tnlk of defeat is mere idle persi
flage. S.C. defeated U.C.L.A. 52-0;
Stanford held them to a 41-12 vic
tory.
Therefore, on the basis of
comparative scores it is easy to
see that Stanford should win by
at least three touchdowns—
which is more than St. Mary's
did. And that will be something.

game with a .50(1 rating, having
won from Oregon State and, ah,
lost to U.S.C.
Stanford's warriors will not be
completely at a loss beneath the
ineandescents, for the boys have
been practicing for upwards of a
half an hour every evening on their
own field with the aid of a new
lighting system. And that practice
should stand them in good stead
Friday.
However, the smaller relative
of California's awe-inspiring
Coldcn Bear has been making
money while the lights shine.
Finding the competition with
U.S.C. too still during Saturday
afternoons, the Bruins scheduled
their games for Friday nights
and have been drawing fair
sized crowds.
Even the rooting section stunts
have been adapted to their new en
vironment, and electric lights spell
out "UCLA" and other spectacular
sights for the edification of the
audiences. Half of the lighting sys
tem is turned out to permit per
formance of the stunts.
But climatic conditions may
handicap the Redshirts more
than the Bruins. According to
one of our undercover scouts,
a heavy dew falls in the Colos
seum at night, and after about
ten minutes of play a white
jersey is guaranteed to look ex
ceedingly sad.
One of the most encouraging fea
tures of the game is the fact that
as far as Conference records go, a
win over the Bruins counts just as
much as a win over the Trojans.
However, a loss would look about
six times worse.
According to our own ideas,
limits and passes will be harder
to judge in the great white
light, but otherwise there will
not be much difference in play
ing conditions. Since Stanford
has done best with her aerial
attack, the situation may not be
so rosy.
However, the boys will always
have an alibi if they lose. It will
have been their first game at night
and the strange surrounding may
be blamed for the downfall. Yet, all
this tnlk of defeat is mere idle persi
flage. S.C. defeated U.C.L.A. 52-0;
Stanford held them to a 41-12 vic
tory.
Therefore, on the basis of
comparative scores it is easy to
see that Stanford should win by
at least three touchdowns—
which is more than St. Mary's
did. And that will be something.
