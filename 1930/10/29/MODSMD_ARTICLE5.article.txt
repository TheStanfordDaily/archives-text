# DRAMA READING WELL RECEIVED
## Audience Charmed By Fine Characterization 
### Helen Thomas 
With a facility of expression that
charmed her audience, Mrs. Guy
Farrington of San Francisco last
night read "The Outsider," a suc
cessful English play by Dorothy
Brandon, in the Little Theatre, for
the Tuesday evening lecture series.
The play, which has been enthu
siastically received in London as
well as in New York, is the story
of the heroic struggle of a young
Englishwoman, Lalage- Sturdie, to
overcome the handicap of invalid
ism. She has been a cripple from
childhood, but to win the love of
young Basil Owen she undergoes
treatment at the hands of Anton
Ragatzy, a Czecho-slovakian doctor
whose cures have awakened con
siderable comment in London medi
cal circles. Its action moves swiftly
after the first act, and has moments
of extreme suspense, humor, and
pathos. Miss Brandon seems io have
paid particular attention to the cli
maxes at the end of each scene,
though the one in the final acl which
combines both Lallie's final cure
and the discovery of her love for
Ragatzy is especially moving.
Mrs. Farrington's characterizations
were unusually well done. Her audi
ence found it impossible to keep
from seeing moving, breathing ac
tors on the empty stage. The play
gives an excellent opportunity for
dialect work in the roles of th c > Eng
lish maid, Prichard, the Scotch Doc
tor Ladd, and the Slovak, Ragatzy.
Her interpretations of the masculine
roles were in direct contrast to the
very feminine voice of Lallie, and
even in the latter the emotional
changes were beautifully turned.
Her weary whisper from the girl in
torture was second only to the ag
gressive, self-assured voico of Ra
gatzy in its realism, while through
out the play her inflections were so
perfect, bodily action was not neces
sary to convey the author's meao -
