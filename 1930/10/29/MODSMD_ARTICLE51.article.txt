# Soccer Varsity Overwhelms San Jose State, 3-0
## MALONEY SOCCER SQUAD VICTOR IN CONFERENCE FRAY Small Score Not Indicative Of Superior Strength Of Stanford Players 
### 
Dominating the game from start ,
to finish, but unable to cash in on ,
its scoring chances and run up a j
big score, the Stanford soccer var- i
sity defeated San Jose State College
3-0 in a California soccer confer
ence tilt here yesterday afternoon. )
After the fust minute of play ;
there was never any doubt as to 1
the winner, and the only question |
was the size ol' the score Stanford
would run up.
Many Corner Kicks
Right from the start Harry Mo
loney's men carried the fight into 1
San Jose territory, and the first ten
minutes or so were largely taken up
with corner kicks made by the Card
wings which were never quite
driven into the net for a goal.
Goodwin, San Jose goalie, made j
some beautiful one-hand stops that
saved sure tallies. At last, after j
missing six or seven good chances j
to score by a matter of inches, the !
Cards registered a point in the lat
ter part of the first half when Falk
made a nice kick in from a sharp
angle that fooled the goalie.
The second tally came shortly af
ter, this time on a powerful drive •
from Captain Eberhart's good right [
leg. He was about eight yards out
at the time and had no one in front
of him but the goal guard.
San Jose Rallies
Coach Cakebread's San Jose boys
staged something of a rally in the
, final half, and came within an ace 1
' of scoring several times.
However, Stanford held control of
the situation except for occasional
spurts, and collected a third goal
when Eberhart took a beautiful long
boot from Dulton and knocked it
squarely into the net with his head.
Taylor Plays Well
Taylor at center halfback played
a whale of a game for San Jose,
although he attempted to do too
much all by himself. It was an
nounced that he had been disquali
l fied, but just before the game a
meeting of the officers of the con
, ference decided to allow him to play
' in the remaining games this month.

wings which were never quite
driven into the net for a goal.
Goodwin, San Jose goalie, made j
some beautiful one-hand stops that
saved sure tallies. At last, after j
missing six or seven good chances j
to score by a matter of inches, the !
Cards registered a point in the lat
ter part of the first half when Falk
made a nice kick in from a sharp
angle that fooled the goalie.

from Captain Eberhart's good right [
leg. He was about eight yards out
at the time and had no one in front
of him but the goal guard.
San Jose Rallies
Coach Cakebread's San Jose boys
staged something of a rally in the
, final half, and came within an ace 1
' of scoring several times.
However, Stanford held control of
the situation except for occasional
spurts, and collected a third goal
when Eberhart took a beautiful long
boot from Dulton and knocked it
squarely into the net with his head.
Taylor Plays Well
Taylor at center halfback played
a whale of a game for San Jose,
although he attempted to do too
much all by himself. It was an
nounced that he had been disquali
l fied, but just before the game a
meeting of the officers of the con
, ference decided to allow him to play
' in the remaining games this month.
Dominating the game from start ,
to finish, but unable to cash in on ,
its scoring chances and run up a j

3-0 in a California soccer confer
ence tilt here yesterday afternoon. )
After the fust minute of play ;
there was never any doubt as to 1
the winner, and the only question |

wings which were never quite
driven into the net for a goal.
