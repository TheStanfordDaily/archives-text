# CARD BABES LACK EXPERIENCED MEN FOR SOCCER TILTS
## 
### 
Entire lack of experienced ma
terial has been an almost insur
mountable obstacle to Coach Ward
Smith in developing a strong fresh
man soccer squad this year, and
this difficulty may result in the de
feat of the Card babes Saturday in
the first game of their annual series
with the University of California
freshmen.
Very few of the '34 men had ever
i played soccer before this year, and
in consequence Smith has had to
concentrate on basic fundamentals
with the result that he has been un
able to develop much of an attack.
The best apparent chance for the
Cards to come out ahead Saturday
, lies in the fact that they may play
j over their heads, since the California
I games are the really important ones
! on the schedule. Regular scrimmage
: with the varsity is giving the babes
! valuable experience, and if Smith
, can develop an aggressive attack, his
i men will have a chance of victory.
