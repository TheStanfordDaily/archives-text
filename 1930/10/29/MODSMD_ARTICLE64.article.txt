# FRESHMAN ELEVEN TO POINT TOWARD "LITTLE BIG GAME"
## Injuries Dull Hopes Of Banner Year For Card Babes, Says Coach 
### Stewart Crawford 
Considerably dulled by a tough
early-season schedule which has
crippled the freshman team, hopes
of a banner year for Coach Jimmy
"Rabbit" Bradshaw's yearling eleven
at present do not look any too
bright.
With the two most important
"conference" games scheduled for
the next two week-ends, Bradshaw
and his crippled warriors can hax'dly
hope to take both contests. U.S.C.
and California in the order named
would be a tough enough assign
ment for the Card babes even if
they were in perfect condition, but
in their present state, it looks like
too big an order to fill.
Fight Hard To Win
In four out of five games played
so far this season, the yearlings
have had to fight hard all the way
to win two, tie one, and lose one.
Their first start was the 13-13 tussle
with a strong Sacramento J.C.
eleven, the following week qame the
hard-fought 7-6 victory over the
Santa Clara babes.
With a rest the following Saturday
in an easy 24 to 0 win over the
Armstrong Business College team,
the Cards were able to take the
highly touted Bruin freshmen at
Los Angeles a week-end later by a
21-6 count, but received three in
juries in the affray.
Last Saturday's crushing defeat at
the hands of the St. Mary's babes
left three more first-stringers crip
i pled, and the whole team pretty
well worn down.
Bradshaw, having little hope of
taking both Southern California and
U.C. in succession, will be pointing
more for the "little big game" than
for the Trojans. If he can bring his
cripples through the U.S.C. contest
. without being hit by more injuries,
he should have a good chance
against the Bears.
