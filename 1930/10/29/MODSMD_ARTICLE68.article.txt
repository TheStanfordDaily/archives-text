able books made available recently

morial room on the third floor of the
Library are those in the collections
of A. A. Milne and Joseph Conrad.
Many first editions and some limited
publications are listed in the collec
tions.
A. A. Milne's books, although pri
marily for the amusement of chil
dren, have proved a source of pleas
lire to older people. The style of
printing and art work used are out
of the ordinary and well adapted to
the spirit of the books. "The Hums
of Pooh" is an interesting volume
made up of poems by Milne set to
music by H. Fraser-Simson. All the
book.s are illustrated by E. H. Shcp
ard. Among the first editions are
"Christopher Robin's Story Book,"
"By Way of Introduction," and
"Those Were The Days." "Now We
Are Six and "Winnie The Pooh"
are both limited editions.
The Joseph Conrad Collection is
almost complete in both English and
American publications. The first edi
tion of Conrad's first bock, "Al
mayer's Folly," has been secured.
"Lord Jim" in the first edition and
also the first American edition is
available.
