# MANY UNEMPLOYED AT BOULDER DAM CONSTRUCTION SITE
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 28 (/I 3 ).â€”No
work is immediately available at the
Boulder Dam site and those who go
there are liable to end up in the soup
line, Will J. French, director of the
I department of industrial relations,
declared today.
French reported to the governor
| that "it will take nearly a year to
complete the field surveys and in
! vestigations, technical studies and
other preliminary work before actual
i construction starts." He said the
construction, when it does start, will
last about seven years under the
contract system.
"The Salvation Army alone fed
1,500 persons at Las Vegas, Nevada,
during the five years preceding Oc
tober 11," said French. "United
States Government Engineer Young
does not believe more than 1,000
men will be employed at any one
time at Boulder Dam."
