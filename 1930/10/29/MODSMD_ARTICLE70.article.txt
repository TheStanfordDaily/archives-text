# TOYON BID HOLDERS CAN GET PROGRAMS
## 
### 
Programs for the Toyon Informal,
to be held Friday night in the Toyon
lobby, may be obtained tonight by
bid holders from. Clint Evans in
room 135 of that hall. Their color is
described by Evans as "lipstick red."
The decorations for the dance are
to resemble an English conservatory
garden and, according to Evans, will
be very effective. Music will be sup
plied by Gordon Hache and his
Campus Rhythm Band, which has
played for other Toyon dances.
