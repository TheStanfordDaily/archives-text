# REPAIRS ON MUSEUM COMMENCED TODAY
## 
### 
Repairs on the south-west corner
buttress of the Stanford Museum
which was recently noticed to be
cracking are to be begun today, ac
cording to Pedro J. Lemos, director
of the museum.
The building in itself a curiosity,
was the first reinforced concrete
structure ever to be built. It was
one of the few buildings on the
campus which successfully withstood
the 1906 earthquake, justifying
Senator Stanford's faith in the then
original type of architecture.
