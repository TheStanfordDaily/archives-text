NEW YORK, Oct. 29. (/P) â€”
When a stranger asked Pros
perino Razzano to construct a
bomb for him, Razzano thought
it a good joke to humor him
with a fake bomb, but now he
has some doubt about it.
At first reluctant, he finally
acquiesced when offered $100
down and $150 more on deliv
ery. So he made a "bomb" of
a length of rubber hose, several
bits of broken tile, and a few
old socks.
But when he delivered the
bomb he found the stranger
was Detective Eugene Cane
vari, who had received infor
mation that Razzano was a
bomb-maker for gangsters. And
when the detetcive found the
bomb was a dud he arrested
Razzano for obtaining money
under false pretenses.
