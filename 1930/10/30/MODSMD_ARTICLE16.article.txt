# OFFICER POSTED AT INTERSECTION
## Traffic Signals To Arrive In Two Months 
### 
Beginning today, the state traffic
patrol will station an officer at the
'intersection of Univei'sity avenue
and El Camino Real daily to take
charge of traffic at that point from
4 p.m. until the peak flow of ma
chines is past. This will be done
until traffic controls have been in
stalled.
This action is the result of the
conference held Tuesday morning
of the Palo Alto city council at
which the question of the main
crossings on the highway were dis
cussed. At that time Otto Langer,
supervisor of traffic of the highway
patrol, offered to take up the matter
with officials in Sacramento.
The equipment for the signals
which it is proposed to erect at the
University avenue-El Camino Real
crossing is due to arrive in about
two months.
