# WILBUR DISMISSES AIDE AS OIL SCANDAL CLAIM BRANDED AS BASELESS
## Kelley Accused of Playing Politics; Official Demands Denial of Charge To Be Published Under Oath; "Public Servant" Claim Is Denied 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29. (/I'jâ€”Ralph S. Kelley was dismissed from the
Interior Department today and shortly afterward a demand was made
by a Republican that the former Denver land office official publish a full
statement under oath "if he would clear himself of the implication of
playing politics."
Senator Glenn, Republican, Illinois, in a statement through the Repub
lican National Committee, said Kelley could not claim to be a public
servant rendering patriotic service unless he could show he did not sell

this articles to any "newspaper or
> ganization or individual and that
their publication was in no wise as
sociated with partisan campaign
politics."
May Clear Self
"If Mr. Kelley wishes to clear
himself of the implication of playing
politics and seeking remuneration
for his articles, he should publish a
| full statement under oath at once,"
he said.
Earlier in the day, Secretary Wil
bur wrote Kelley that his conduct
had been such "that your connec
; tion with the Interior Department
may be considered terminated by
dismissal as of September 29, 1930."
On that date, the Secretary re
-1 fused to accept Kelley's resignation
I and suspended him pending an in
-1 vestigation of his charges of mal
administration of oil shale lands.
Ignored Request
Kelley ignored a request by Wil
bur to supply the department with
; specific information and refused to
lay his charges before, the Depart
ment of Justice, but later outlined
them in a series of articles in a
New York newspaper.
Following the report of the De
partment of Justice, which held the
charges unfounded, President Hoo
ver yesterday denounced them as
"fabrications" and an attempt to
"charge odious oil scandals" to his
administration.
