# NEW HOSPITAL ON CAMPUS WILL HAVE MOST MODERN EQUIPMENT
## 
### William 
Three months before it officially
opens for occupancy, the main out
lines of the new half-million dollar
Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital, under
construction on the campus, near the
entrance to Palm Drive, are already
visible.
The concrete-pouring for the en
tire structure, which measures 200
feet in length, and 45 feet in width
in the main wing, has been complete
for more than two weeks. Now the
latest thermostatically controlled
heating and ventilating systems arc
being installed. In addition, work on
a refrigeration system with conven
ient outlets in various parts of the
building is being carried on.
To Be Different
But the hospital as it is today and
as it will be within, some three
months, according to the architect,
W. G. Corlctt, are almost two differ
ent things. Today the hospital is
surrounded by the thousand and one
of tools a building operation. First
noticeable are the tool sheds and
officc shacks with the name of the
firm of contractors printed thereon
in big black letters so that no literate
can lone; remain unaware that the
upbringing of one of the most mod
ern hospitals in the country has been
intrusted to the firm of K. E. Parker.
Then there is the dust that lies
heaped in mounds and that takes

C. liubcns
! the place of rich green grass, giving
the earth a bleak, hard appearance.
I The building itself is more of a
shadow than a substance. It is only
an outline, windowless and dirty
I gray in color. Two wooden towers
to hoist cement and lime up the en
i tire six stories of the structure line

I picturesque mixture of piping and
I lumber of all shapes and sizes. Laths

I up, added to the background of

view of the Pacific highway less than
200 yards away, make it seem as
if the building material as well as
' the building and builders were iso
| lated in the midst of a forest.
Busy On Entrance
At the entrance to the hospital,
where steps of marble will one day
rest, workmen in dusty overalls
wheel their barrows full of mortar
up two narrow insecure-looking
planks, and two men pound heavy
I hammers over the front gate.
Then down the narrow aisle on
what will be the main floor, on
either side are outlines of channel
I iron in box form. These, in less than
three months, will be kitchens, wait
ing rooms, doctor's quarters, labora
( tories —when the laths and tiles
down below combine with human
labor in proper proportions.

Three months before it officially

Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital, under
construction on the campus, near the
entrance to Palm Drive, are already

The concrete-pouring for the en
tire structure, which measures 200
feet in length, and 45 feet in width
in the main wing, has been complete
for more than two weeks. Now the
latest thermostatically controlled
heating and ventilating systems arc
being installed. In addition, work on
a refrigeration system with conven
ient outlets in various parts of the
building is being carried on.

But the hospital as it is today and
as it will be within, some three
months, according to the architect,
W. G. Corlctt, are almost two differ
ent things. Today the hospital is
surrounded by the thousand and one
of tools a building operation. First
noticeable are the tool sheds and
officc shacks with the name of the
firm of contractors printed thereon
in big black letters so that no literate
can lone; remain unaware that the
upbringing of one of the most mod
ern hospitals in the country has been
intrusted to the firm of K. E. Parker.
