### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 20. (A 3 )â€” Dr.
Robert Gordon Sproul, University
of California president, wrote today
in an alumni publication that foot-

ball would re
main at the in
stitution as long
as he was presi
dent and would
be played by
"geunine stu
dents, not re
cruited or subsi
dized."
The president
stated he would
neve r consider

elimina ti on of
football no matter how efficient an
educational program might be
evolved.
Although football, he said, should
be kept secondary to the main busi
ness of the university, the game is
necessary for "college spirit and to
serve as a magnet to draw old grads
back to the campus.
"Professional athletes," he said,
"leave me cold no matter what uni
form they wear."
