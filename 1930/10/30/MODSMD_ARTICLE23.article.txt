# WORLD SAFETY IS DEPENDENT ON U.S. AND ENGLAND-GRAY

"The safety of the world depends
upon the friendship of England and
America," stated Professor Henry
David Gray, last night in an in
formal talk before a small but in
terested group at the first meeting
of the International Relations Club,
in the West Memorial Library.
Gray, who spoke on the "Present
Attitude of England Toward Amer
ica," returned last year from his
sabbatical leave which he spent
largely in London. While there he
met many of the delegates to the
Naval Parity Conference, and was
a director of the American Univer
sities Union.
"I found," said 6ray, "that the
further up I went in social and edu
cational spheres the fewer were the
slurs made about America and the
greater was the friendship shown
toward our country. English friend
ship for the United States has in
creased greatly during the past year
snice the realization that we are as
bad off, economically, as they are.
They have begun to realize that we
are not so unfair in our demand
that the war debt be paid."
