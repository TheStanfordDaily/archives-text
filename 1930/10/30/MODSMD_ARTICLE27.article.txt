# SPEEDER MUSHES ON, UNDISMAYED BY DAVIS'S SIREN
## 
### 
The next time Gordon Davis,
campus cop, chases a speeding
car, he will think twice before
he uses his siren.
Davis spotted a battered old
sedan with an lowa license
tearing down Palm Drive in
excess of what the law allows
in the way of speed. The pride
of the campus police force took
up the chase, blowing his siren
lustily as he drew near the of
fender. But there was no slow
ing down on the part of the
sedanâ€”at least not until Davis
drew alongside and almost ran
it into the ditch. The driver
looked mildly surprised.
"Oh, it's you, eh? Thought
it'd be one of them collegiate
fellers, when I heerd that thar
sireen."
"Don't traffic cops have si
rens where you come from?"
inquired Davis sardonically.
"Naw. They have motor
sickles," was the answer. One
run, no -hits, no errors.
