# WARNER SENDS TEAM THROUGH NIGHT PRACTICE
## Cards Leave Tonight For Bruin Game; Milligan Put On Varsity SPIN PLAY INTRODUCED 
### Len Kallmann 
Watched by a fair-sized crowd,
Pop Warner put his men through a
night practice last evening to pre
pare them for their clash with
U.C.L.A. in the Coliseum tomorrow
night. Ghost footballs were in evi
dence, and the Old Fox took advant
age of the cool weather to send the
men through a long session, lasting
from 7 o'clock until well after !)
o'clock.
A squad of 50 men will leave for
the south tonight after practice, and
will include all the men able to
make the trip. The men will stay at.
the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena,
and will remain in the south to
watch the Trojans play Denver Uni
versity Saturday.
Milligan Up
Due to the shortage of centers,
Rob Milligan of the Grays, has been
promoted to the varsity squad, where
he will remain for the balance of
the season. Neither Mar Albertson
nor Perry Taylor, first string cen
ters, nor Dick Bogue, were out at.
practice last night. "Dusty" Allen,
second string quarterback, watched
practice from the sidelines, due to a
pulled muscle suffered in Monday's
scrimmage.
Neither Captain Ray Tandy, Phil
Neill, nor Phil Moffatt went through
and extended workout last night.
Tandy appeared with a heavily
bandaged knee, while neither Neill
nor Moffatt were used in the scrim
mage which occupied the men. War
ner will undoubtedly save all three
of these men this week-end.

Lining up a team composed of Kay
Albertson and Don Colvin, ends;
Chuck Ehrhorn and George Grey,
tackles; Ray Dawson and Ray Hu
len, guards; Bill Marks, center;
Harry Hillman, quarterback; Ernie
Caddel and Rudie Rintala, halves;
and Bill Simkins, fullback; Warner
occupied the men with a hard
hitting scrimmage.
"Rambling" Rudie Rintala and
Bill Simkins furnisfied most of the
advances for the ball-carrying out
fit, while Norm McLeod appeared in
the backfield a trifle too often to
suit Warner, who called plays for
the men. Simkins in particular
showed plenty of fire during the
workout.
Spinner Used
Pop Warner's spin play, a new in
novation dating from last Monday's
practice, was given its baptism by
fire last night, and should be a win
ner. However, most of the work was
concentrated on line plunges and
scoring plays for use within an op
ponent's 20-yard line.
All of the men, with the exception
of Tandy, Neill and Moffatt, were
sent in to the scrimmage, and fol
lowing some work on the dummy
line, the men were sent in after one
of the longest practice session;? of
the season.
Judging from the work of the men
in last night's session, the Stanford
varsity will not be handicapped by
their first night game. Passes and
punts appeared no more difficult, to
judge than is the case in the day
time, and with the striking appeal
ance of the white football, an aerial
game should be helped.
Friday's game will undoubtedly
be broadcast by some of the South
ern radio stations, and details of the
station handling the game and the
hour it will be on the air may be
found in tomorrow's Daily. KFWB
has been handling U.C.L.A.'s night
games to date, and will probably
broadcast the Stanford clash.

Milligan Up
Due to the shortage of centers,
Rob Milligan of the Grays, has been
promoted to the varsity squad, where
he will remain for the balance of
the season. Neither Mar Albertson
nor Perry Taylor, first string cen
ters, nor Dick Bogue, were out at.
practice last night. "Dusty" Allen,
second string quarterback, watched
practice from the sidelines, due to a
pulled muscle suffered in Monday's
scrimmage.
Neither Captain Ray Tandy, Phil
Neill, nor Phil Moffatt went through
and extended workout last night.
Tandy appeared with a heavily
bandaged knee, while neither Neill
nor Moffatt were used in the scrim
mage which occupied the men. War
ner will undoubtedly save all three
of these men this week-end.

occupied the men with a hard

"Rambling" Rudie Rintala and
Bill Simkins furnisfied most of the
advances for the ball-carrying out
fit, while Norm McLeod appeared in
the backfield a trifle too often to
suit Warner, who called plays for
the men. Simkins in particular
showed plenty of fire during the
workout.
Spinner Used
Pop Warner's spin play, a new in
novation dating from last Monday's
practice, was given its baptism by
fire last night, and should be a win
ner. However, most of the work was
concentrated on line plunges and
scoring plays for use within an op
ponent's 20-yard line.
All of the men, with the exception
of Tandy, Neill and Moffatt, were
sent in to the scrimmage, and fol
lowing some work on the dummy
line, the men were sent in after one
of the longest practice session;? of
the season.
Judging from the work of the men
in last night's session, the Stanford
varsity will not be handicapped by
their first night game. Passes and
punts appeared no more difficult, to
judge than is the case in the day
time, and with the striking appeal
ance of the white football, an aerial
game should be helped.
Friday's game will undoubtedly
be broadcast by some of the South
ern radio stations, and details of the
station handling the game and the
hour it will be on the air may be
found in tomorrow's Daily. KFWB
has been handling U.C.L.A.'s night
games to date, and will probably
broadcast the Stanford clash.
Watched by a fair-sized crowd,
Pop Warner put his men through a
night practice last evening to pre
pare them for their clash with
U.C.L.A. in the Coliseum tomorrow
night. Ghost footballs were in evi

men through a long session, lasting
