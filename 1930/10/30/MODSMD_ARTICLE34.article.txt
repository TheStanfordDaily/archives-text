# HOW ABOUT DEFINITE ACTION?

### 
I .a-4 war Stanford fraternities were called upon l>y I )ean t ulver
and the Inter fraternity l ottncil to end the obnoxious practices of
Nell Week. Mouse presidents at the time generally agreed that all
forms of physical torture <hiring the pre-initiatory period should
go. This year the Council has reaffirmed its stand on the question,
hut still Stanford fraternities continue merrily on with their tradi
tional llell Week programs.
I 1 ell Week has heen condemned by the national organizations of
most of the major (ireek letter groups. I'niyersitv administrators
arc unanimously opposed to the. custom. And more recently many
students have joined the campaign to end this rotten practice.
Certainly no one can still helieye that paddling, tubbing. and the
rest of the rdutine that make up the llell Week guantlet are de
sirable, helpful, or worthy.
The purpose of llell Week is to lorce a teeling oi deep humil
ii\ upon pledges before they pass behind the veil to learn the sacred
mysteries of the order. Any organization that must rely on physical
torture to prepare its men for the extending hand of brotherhood
is not worthy of existence. Let us hope that no Stanford fraternity
is in such a position.
It may be admitted that some I onus ot llell Week practice are
harmless; but when the period degenerates to paddling and smutty
stances (and it generally does), it is time to stop.
The initiation ceremony with its beautiful ritual and fine drama
tic interpretation should be presented in a sincere, serious, and
formal manner. The lofty ideals of \merican fraternities cannot be
subordinated to tilth, torture, and horseplay.
Responsibility for ending this infamous custom rests squarely
in the hands of individual house presidents. There has been quite
i uoiijdi preliminary conversation on the subject. Now is the time
for action.
