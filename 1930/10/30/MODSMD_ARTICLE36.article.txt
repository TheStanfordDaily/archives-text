# IS THIS MORAL TURPITUDE?

### 
"()ttr modern generation has been accused of a good many
things with reference to their moral standards, hut in its wildest
and most "self-cxpressive" moments ii has not taken the attitude
that any act is de facto right or wrong.
I low much more moral turpitude is there in dancing than in
playing cards?
A recent regulation has held that dancing shall not he allowed
in sorority houses on Sunday. The restriction has not been made I"
include card-playing, which most people include under the same
category of mild amusement.
A distinction drawn between the two diversions is arbitrary and
unnecessary. Sunday evening is one of the natural times for in
formal gatherings : and dancing and card playing are the natural
components of such affairs.
The objection will probably be raised that dancing is too noisy.
()n the contrary, it is often quieter for the neighbors. Dancing in
doors to a moderatelv quiet radio is certainly easier on the house
next door than several conversations and games staged in the patio.
If noise is the onlv objection, a definite hoiu* lor the dance to cease
would be more satisfactorv than the present absolute prohibition,
hi w of the students are in favor of the present scheme.
