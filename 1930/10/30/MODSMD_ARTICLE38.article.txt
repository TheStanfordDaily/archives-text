lIKIi WEDDINCI NICiHT—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
A merry farce in spite of Clara
Bow, "Her Wedding Night" provides
a light and pleasant evening.
Charles Ruggles, veteran inebri
ate, quite effectively steals the pic
ture from the star, with the aid of
"Sheets" Gallagher. The heroine of
the Calneva affair seems to have
been the face on the cutting-room
floor in this production, being in a
minimum of scenes in her own ve
hicle.
The locale of the hilarious piece
is laid in France, where a little
knowledge of the language proves
worse than none for Miss Bow and
Gallagher, who find themselves mar
ried while registering (as they
thought) at a village inn.
Matters are further complicated
by the fact that Gallagher used the
name of his friend, Ralph Forbes,
who thus becomes the legal husband.
Meanwhile Ruggles just fusses
around until he manages to run
away with all honors. —L. M. C.
SCOTLAND YARD—At the Varsity
Theatre.
Masquerading as the man whose
face plastic surgery has given him,
Edmund Lowe, assisted by Joan
'Bennett, takes a story which is good
in itself, and makes one of the best
pictures of the year.
The first scene, in 1914, on the
Thames river, commences a current

of excitement which carries through
a battle, a wreck, and an attempted
robbery, after which the masquer
ade ends—with a man's life changed
as well as his face.
While the theme is r.ot necessar
ily new, it is different, and ihe lines
unusually good.' From beginning to
end, "Scotland Yard" is well worth
seeing. —J. N.
A NOTE IN MUSIC. By Rosamond
Lehmann. Henry Ilolt &c Co.,
New York. (At the Stan
lord Bookstore. $2.50.)
Rosamond Lehmann's "Note in
Music" justifies the praise accorded
her first novel, "Dusty Answer,"
which appeared several years ago.
Her style is pleasing, and her char
acters are interesting and well
drawn.
The only criticism which may be
directed against this book is that it
concerns itself with too many char
acters and is not, as a result, a uni
fied story. The characters have only
a slight connection with one another,
and the love of a number of per
sons for the hero, Hugh, is not suf
\ flciently important to hold the book
together.
I In no other respect has Miss Leh
marin followed (he modern expon
j ents of chaos. Her novel is illumi
nated with something which seems
to be a true understanding of peo
ple, and she has avoided exaggera
tion in the drawing of the majority
of her characters. —E. E. W.

A NOTE IN MUSIC. By Rosamond
Lehmann. Henry Ilolt &c Co.,
New York. (At the Stan
lord Bookstore. $2.50.)
Rosamond Lehmann's "Note in
Music" justifies the praise accorded
her first novel, "Dusty Answer,"
which appeared several years ago.
Her style is pleasing, and her char
acters are interesting and well
drawn.
The only criticism which may be
directed against this book is that it
concerns itself with too many char
acters and is not, as a result, a uni
fied story. The characters have only
a slight connection with one another,
and the love of a number of per
sons for the hero, Hugh, is not suf
\ flciently important to hold the book
together.
I In no other respect has Miss Leh
marin followed (he modern expon
j ents of chaos. Her novel is illumi
nated with something which seems
to be a true understanding of peo
ple, and she has avoided exaggera
tion in the drawing of the majority
of her characters. —E. E. W.
lIKIi WEDDINCI NICiHT—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
A merry farce in spite of Clara
Bow, "Her Wedding Night" provides
a light and pleasant evening.
Charles Ruggles, veteran inebri
ate, quite effectively steals the pic
ture from the star, with the aid of
"Sheets" Gallagher. The heroine of
the Calneva affair seems to have
been the face on the cutting-room
floor in this production, being in a
minimum of scenes in her own ve
hicle.
The locale of the hilarious piece
is laid in France, where a little
knowledge of the language proves
worse than none for Miss Bow and
Gallagher, who find themselves mar
ried while registering (as they
thought) at a village inn.
Matters are further complicated
by the fact that Gallagher used the
name of his friend, Ralph Forbes,
who thus becomes the legal husband.
Meanwhile Ruggles just fusses
around until he manages to run
away with all honors. —L. M. C.
