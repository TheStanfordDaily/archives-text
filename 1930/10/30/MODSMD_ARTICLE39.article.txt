# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
For want of more exciting sport,
sorority houses seem to be going in
for fires on the roof. The shingled
tops of the Pi Beta Phi and Gamma
Phi Beta houses have both burst
suddenly into flame within the last
three days. One conflagration can
be safely explained by cigarettes.
The other house has a national rul
ing which bars the Demon Cig from
entering within doors. Someone
must have been burning incense . . .

On the front page of a recent
Daiyl we noticed a Bookstore
ad: "Howard Jones' Football
Game —Anyone can play." May
he anyone can—lnit the news is
a little late.
We're learning so many things
that aren't in textbooks this quar
ter—and from genuine professors,
too. One of these is that "the an
cient Romans drank beer, but never
whiskey or distilled liquors. That
i is a modern invention."
And then they tell us about
j how casual things were in the
old days, and "why can't we he
more like that?" After all, the
Koman chariots were run by
horse-power, not by gasoline
engines. *
They didn't have to worry about
1 whether gasoline and alcohol mixed,
or not. Both ways, they had an easy
edge over us. But then again, if we
had to dash up and down Palm

1 Drive in horse-drawn chariots, we'd
be subdued, too.
In a moment of rashly serious
thought, we opened the library
dictionary to the definition of
"education," yesterday. Two
moths perked up in astonish
ment and flew out from be
tween the pages.
The U.S.C. stunt between halves,
satirizing Stanford students as
bookworms, was a little ahead of
time, don't you think? (Say "Yes"
01 I'll shoot!) When this is a school
for graduate students only, they can
say all they please. Just now,
though, we still have a football
team.
Varsity practice is turning into
v.ork instead of play, what with
practice lasting from scven
thirty on, far into each night.
Somehow, it doesn't seem quite
fair—they're a wonder team, all
right, hut we wonder if they
wonder what we wonder about
the rest of this season.
Cabbages hopes to be among the
crowd that'll give the team a fren
zicd(?) farewell, when they start
South, tonight. If you haven't a
more personal interest, you'll get a
j laugh at the collegiate display of
brown derbies. Nothing else like it
under the sun. Go and see for your
| self.
