Students at Occidental College
complain of professors who fail to 1
show enthusiasm when speaking to
the class.
How any lecturer can muster
enough courage to speak, let alone
show enthusiasm, when one-fourth
of the class is reading the college
daily, another fourth is talking to
co-eds, a third fourth is sleeping
mentally, physically, or both, and
at least another fourth has cut class,
is more than anyone can see.
A dispatch from the Univer
sity of Glasgow says that women
students are ugly in form, face,
and mind. That is the most ex
travagant statement we have
heard in some time.
We are not holding a brief for
the co-ed's intellect, but, but . . .
The University of Washington in
forms the public that the most valu
able part of college training is not
found in a library or around a study
table.
That statement needs clarifi
cation. to say the least, and at
best hinges on one's idea of
valuable. Then again, the Cou
gars do not do libraries justice.
Beer will be sold on the campus
of the University of Toronto. Now
for consistency's sake the University
of Maine should give up its "Stein
Song" to its Canadian neighbor.
What is more, it is a farce for
the University of IVlaine to have
a stein song when the state in
which it is locatcd and whose
name it hears was the first state
in the Union to have prohibi
tion.
Charles Hoover is a member of
the Democratic Club at the Univer
sity of Kansas. Now what will
CHARLES Curtis and Herbert
HOOVER do about it?
