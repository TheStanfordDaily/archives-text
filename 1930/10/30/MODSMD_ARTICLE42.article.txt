## IT'S A HIGH-SCHOOL ORGANIZATION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since the appearance of an article j
and editorial concerning the Student 1
Sobriety Society and myself, many
students have asked me if the facts '
presented by The Daily were cor
rect. One freshman feeling that The
Daily was ridiculing me came lo my
defense in the paper. Many students
have suggested that 1 ough< to cor
rect the mis-information presented, !
and after waiting until now 1 have j
also reached Unit conclusion.
1 was asked by another paper if I 1
intended to continue my work with \
the Student Sobriety Society while
at Stanford, and 1 stated that 1 did,
and would welcome any student's
assistance in the editing of the Stu
dent American. This paper misun
derstood and believed that this or
ganization was a college organiza
tion and that I intended to start a
Stanford chapter soon. The Daily
saw this article and, without con- 1
suiting me, reproduced a part of it
and later printed an editorial in
connection. If The Daily had con
sulted me they would have obtained
the facts, but I certainly would have
requested that they publish nothing, i
for I am not looking for publicity.
This has been my motive in re
maining silent this long, breaking it

only by necessity, 112 should inform
The Daily that the Student Sobriety
Society is a high-school organization
and thus 1 am not seeking any mem
bers at Stanford.
For the benefit of The Daily and
the readers I might say, however,
that this organization has the in
dorsement and backing of people of
prominence, and is nyt a personal
idle gesture. Senator liornh, oi
Idaho; Senator Jones, of Washing
ton, who said: "The More, the Bet
ter"; J. C. Penney, Thomas Edison,
the inventor, S. B. Wilson, Chief
Justice of the Minnesota SuDrem*
Court, and Governor Chiistianson
of Minnesota, who termed it a
"laudable-undertaking" ;iâ–  ><I its pur
pose "most commendable." are
among those who have either en
dorsed or have contributed to ii
financially, or both.
I cannot in.any light see the in
direct reference to myself by The
Daily's reference to freshmen as
"other innocent young bab< newly
severed from the hearth ; tone at
home," as justified for any reason.
1 might state that my mother, tin
only other member of my family
(my father having died nine year:;
ago) has established her permanent
residence in Palo Alto.
The Crusaders, a wet yolith
league, I have been informed intends
to put on a drive soon among Stan
ford students. I shall watch with
interest the attitude of The Daily
if and when the Crusaders start
their work.
This letter has been written in the
spirit of friendly correction, and in
the hope that it will tend to clear up
any idea that I, as a freshman, in
tend to start an organization of this
nature at Stanford.
Sincerely,
William N. Plymat.
