# BARBERS WIN ON SCORE CHART FOR TROJAN CALAMITY
## 
### 
Though the campus mourns the
11-12 walloping handed Stanford by
U.S.C. last Saturday, the three bar
bers of Encina Barber Shop are re
joicing over what proved for them
a happy turn of fate. They are "in'
$5.
Since Stanford has been playing
football, they have kept a chart on
which anyone may place his guess
as to the score of the next game to
ie played by the Cardinal eleven.

For the U.S.C. and other big games,
$5 is given to the individual turning
in the correct uuoss: for other games
the prize is $2.50.
Last week's lopsided score was
not guessed by anyone, and the bar
bels have kept their money. Only
once before, in the case of a Santa
Clara game several seasons ago, did
the correct rest*)! fail to be pro
dieted on the barber shop's charts.
