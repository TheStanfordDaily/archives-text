## YALE BLUES 
### 
According to press accounts, Yale
University has awakened on two
successive Sunday mornings to
realize strange things have occurred
within the Yale Bowl. It seems that
in both the Georgia and Army
games illegitimate touchdowns have
been scored, one by and one upon,
the men of Old Eli. Naturally
enough, the one scored upon Yale
rankles most.
Just exactly what the Blue hoys
propose to do about these unfor
tunate events is not quite clear, hut
ul any rate something ought to he
done. Here two touchdowns have
been chalked up pro and con by
unfair practices undetected until it
was loo late. And. adding insult to
injury, the extra point was added
in giving the Army a 7-7 tie.
To expose the unfair practice, it
.seems that the first foul occurred in ,
the third quarter of the Georgia-
Yale game. Yale kicked oil, and one j
of the Georgia boys neglected to •
bold on to the football when he was
harrassed on thp 20-yard line. In j
fact, the pigskin oozed from his
clutch inlo the eager arms of a man
Irom Now Haven without touching
the ground.
Presented with such a golden op
portunity to be a hero, the man
from Yale yielded to temptation and
dashed across the goal line. Ilis em
barrassment was complete when the
officials ruled it a touchdown. What
should he do? Overwhelm the
referee by pointing out that such
a fumble could not be advanced
after recovery? No, he would keep
silent and spare the shame such a
revelation would cause.
And so some supporter of the
Blue awoke Sunday morning, Octo
ber If), and realized that a grave
injustice had been permitted. In
fact, a very unfair situation had
been set up, and a possibility re
mained that Yale might have been
whitewashed it justice had been
done.
Smouldering beneath the lash of
injured innocence a fighting Bulldog
on the next week-end fought the
Army Mule to a standstill. Seven-up
(lie scoreboard read at the close of
the contest, but this time the Yale
coaching staff had suspicions. Foul
play was hinted, and moving pic- i
tn res had been taken.
Sunday morning, October 26,
dawned bright and clear, but not for
the denizens of Palo Alto or New
Haven. Motion pictures of the Yale-
Army game proved definitely that
the Army had entirely too much
"vis a torgo" when they scored their
one and only touchdown.
.. .
It seems that on fourth down,
with about two yards to go for a
touchdown, the Army put a man !
through the line for the necessary
yardage. But the Army rations had
been a trifle short that day, and the
man was failing rather dismally in
bis push through the Yale forward
wall.
A fellow Army back, seeing his
companion unable to obtain the ob
jective, charged along behind and
neatly shoved the ball-carrier into
the end zone, where numerous of
ficials felicitated him. "Touchdown!"
exulted the Cadets, for such it
seemed to be.
But the all-seeing eye of the cam
era had recorded this brotherly act,
which is unfortunately forbidden by
football law, and now the Yale lads
are in a quandary. On two succes
sive Saturdays illegal measures
caused feet to tramp upon end zones.
There is no court of appeal. The
scores are already written on the
record books in indelible ink . . .
Alas, poor Yale. —L. K., Jr.

Just exactly what the Blue hoys
propose to do about these unfor
tunate events is not quite clear, hut
ul any rate something ought to he
done. Here two touchdowns have
been chalked up pro and con by
unfair practices undetected until it
was loo late. And. adding insult to
injury, the extra point was added
in giving the Army a 7-7 tie.
To expose the unfair practice, it
.seems that the first foul occurred in ,
the third quarter of the Georgia-
Yale game. Yale kicked oil, and one j
of the Georgia boys neglected to •
bold on to the football when he was
harrassed on thp 20-yard line. In j
fact, the pigskin oozed from his
clutch inlo the eager arms of a man
Irom Now Haven without touching
the ground.
Presented with such a golden op
portunity to be a hero, the man
from Yale yielded to temptation and
dashed across the goal line. Ilis em
barrassment was complete when the
officials ruled it a touchdown. What
should he do? Overwhelm the
referee by pointing out that such
a fumble could not be advanced
after recovery? No, he would keep
silent and spare the shame such a
revelation would cause.
And so some supporter of the
Blue awoke Sunday morning, Octo
ber If), and realized that a grave
injustice had been permitted. In
fact, a very unfair situation had
been set up, and a possibility re
mained that Yale might have been
whitewashed it justice had been
done.
Smouldering beneath the lash of
injured innocence a fighting Bulldog
on the next week-end fought the
Army Mule to a standstill. Seven-up
(lie scoreboard read at the close of
the contest, but this time the Yale
coaching staff had suspicions. Foul
play was hinted, and moving pic- i
tn res had been taken.
Sunday morning, October 26,
dawned bright and clear, but not for
the denizens of Palo Alto or New
Haven. Motion pictures of the Yale-
Army game proved definitely that
the Army had entirely too much
"vis a torgo" when they scored their
one and only touchdown.
.. .
It seems that on fourth down,
with about two yards to go for a
touchdown, the Army put a man !
through the line for the necessary
yardage. But the Army rations had
been a trifle short that day, and the
man was failing rather dismally in
bis push through the Yale forward
wall.
A fellow Army back, seeing his
companion unable to obtain the ob
jective, charged along behind and
neatly shoved the ball-carrier into
the end zone, where numerous of
ficials felicitated him. "Touchdown!"
exulted the Cadets, for such it
seemed to be.
But the all-seeing eye of the cam
era had recorded this brotherly act,
which is unfortunately forbidden by
football law, and now the Yale lads
are in a quandary. On two succes
sive Saturdays illegal measures
caused feet to tramp upon end zones.
There is no court of appeal. The
scores are already written on the
record books in indelible ink . . .
