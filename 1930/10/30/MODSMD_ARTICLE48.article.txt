# Frosh Drop Broncs, Gaels From Grid Schedule
## BABE SEASON TOO ARDUOUS; RULING MADE AS REMEDY Junior Colleges And High Schools To Remain On Schedule 
### 
That the Cardinal freshman eleven
will discontinue its annual grid con
tests with St. Mary's and Santa
Clara was disclosed yesterday by
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
when a ruling which eliminates
games with any non-conference
yearling squad was announced.
The reason given for the change
in the babe schedule was that the
season as arranged at present is too
strenuous. The present situation in
which Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
men find themselves would indicate
that this reasoning is justified.
In taking a beating at the hands
of Saint Mary's last Saturday, the
freshman eleven sustained several
injuries which will greatly hamper
them in their conference game with
U.S.C. Saturday. Santa Clara was
also a tough assignment earlier in
the season.
The week following the Trojan
contest, the Card babes will face
California in the Little Big Game.
There is little doubt but that Brad
shaw's men would be in much bet
ter shape for these two tilts if the
non-conference games with Santa
Clara and Saint Mary's had been
eliminated.
The ruling does not alTct the pres
ent arrangement allowing games
with junior colleges and high
schools.
