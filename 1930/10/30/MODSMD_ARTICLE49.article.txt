# SECOND ROUND DUE IN TENNIS MATCHES
## 
### 
Interclass tennis results indicate
that senior and frosh netmen take
a more lively interest in the sport
than the junior and sophomore en
trants, according to Coach Elywn
Bugge.
To date, juniors and freshmen
have partially completed only the
first round of play, while the sen
iors have pretty well played out the
second round and the freshmen
have completed the second round
and begun on the third.
Coach Bugge urges all entrants
who have not completed second
round play to do so as soon as
possible, as the second round must
be completed by November I. Men
in upper brackets are responsible
for arranging the matches with their
opponents.
