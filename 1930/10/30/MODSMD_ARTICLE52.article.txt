# MALONEY COACHES SOCCER VARSITY ON OFFENSE FOR BEAR CONTEST SATURDAY
## 
### 
With all their preliminary con
tests behind them, soccer men are
clearing the decks for real action
now, as they set themselves to take
California Saturday in the first game
of the annual series.
Hitherto Coach Hary Maloney's
kicking athletes have just been
marking time, gaining experience
| and condition for their real work
of the season, the defeat of Cali
fornia. In soccer, even more than
in the case of Pop Warner's football
varsity, the California games are
all-important, and everything else
is subordinated to that one objec
tive.
Tied Hornets
The team slipped into a tie with I
the Hornets at the start of the sea
! son simply because Maloney wanted J
to try out his reserves with a view
to the coming encounters with the
Blue .and Gold and had to weaken i
i the eleven on the field in order to i
do so.
It is highly probable that San 1
Mateo would not have gotten away
with a victory if several substitutes
had not been injected into the game, i
The tilt with the Rovers was, of
course, purely a practice affair
without much idea of winning, but \
Ihe Cards would not have been de
feated more than 1-0 if the first team
had remained on the field intact i
throughout.
Malonev was not satisfied with i

the functioning of the forwards
Tuesday against San Jose State.
They showed considerable individual
ability, but failed to combine prop
erly. All five forwards could get to
gether for a concerted attack. Three
men would be clicking, and then the
other two wouid miss fire, while at
another time the first three would
be off.
In order to remedy this weakness
most of the practice this week is
being devoted to passing practice
among the members of the forward
line. The days of scrimmage are
over now; all attention is being
turned upon the fine points which
make all the difference between an
I effective offense and one that
1 merely tries hard.

Tied Hornets
The team slipped into a tie with I
the Hornets at the start of the sea
! son simply because Maloney wanted J
to try out his reserves with a view
to the coming encounters with the
Blue .and Gold and had to weaken i
i the eleven on the field in order to i
do so.
It is highly probable that San 1
Mateo would not have gotten away
with a victory if several substitutes
had not been injected into the game, i
The tilt with the Rovers was, of
course, purely a practice affair
without much idea of winning, but \
Ihe Cards would not have been de
feated more than 1-0 if the first team
had remained on the field intact i
throughout.
Malonev was not satisfied with i

the functioning of the forwards
Tuesday against San Jose State.
They showed considerable individual
ability, but failed to combine prop
erly. All five forwards could get to
gether for a concerted attack. Three
men would be clicking, and then the
other two wouid miss fire, while at
another time the first three would
be off.
In order to remedy this weakness
most of the practice this week is
being devoted to passing practice
among the members of the forward
line. The days of scrimmage are
over now; all attention is being
turned upon the fine points which
make all the difference between an
I effective offense and one that
1 merely tries hard.
