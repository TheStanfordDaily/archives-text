# STRONG TROJAN BABE TEAM TO TACKLE CARDS
## Stanford Eleven Crippled By Moragans; Hillman Out Of Lineup 
### Stewart Crawford 
When Coach Devine's Trojan
yearlings travel up to the Farm to
tangle with Bratlshaw's babe eleven
in the Stadium Saturday, the Card
gridmen will be in for a tough af
ternoon.
The Southern California young
sters have showed plenty of power
in keeping a clean slate out of four
starts so far this season.* In their
opening game the Trojans took the
Santa Ana J.C. by a 7-0 score, and
after the 0-0 tie with Compton J.C.
coasted easily over Chaffee J.C. and
the California cubs the two week
ends following.
Trojan Babes in Shape
In taking the Bears two weeks
ago down South, the Troy yearlings
showed a powerful, fast-charging
line backed up with stellar ball
toting by Griffiths, Koough, Sher
man, and Williams. Griffiths at
quarter and Williams in the fullback
berth for the young Thundering
Herd will have to be watched by
the Cards Saturday. Williams is the
hard-driving back that caused Cali
fornia so much trouble in the 27-0
trouncing administered them by the
Trojan babes.
That the invading gridmen will
be in excellent physical condition
is a fbregone conclusion, since after
two easy wins they rested with no
game last Saturday. Coach Devine
has been pointing for the Redshirts,
and would not even lot them make
the trip north to see Ihe S.C.-Stan
ford varsity tilt, claiming that it
might weaken their chance against
Bradshaw's men.
Cards Crippled
That stellar performance of the
Card yearlings in .taking the highly
touted Bruin freshmen by a 21-6
count impressed Devine and his
men, and he is not taking any
chances in preparing for Stanford.
In contrast to the Trojan babe
season so far, Bradshaw's warriors
have had it tough all the way. They
had to fight hard against Sacramento
J C. and Santa Clara in their first
two starts. The score of the U.C.L.A.
tilt hardly indicates how tough the
Bruins were, the Redshirt babes re
ceiving several injuries. The 21 to 0
trouncing at the hands of the Saint
Mary's team last Saturday put sev
eral more men on the injured list.
Ilillman Out
At present, Hillman, the hard
driving babe quarter, is considered
definitely out of Saturday's tussle
with a wrenched shoulder. White
and Kantzner are not in too good
shape, while Edclen, Anderson, and
Tarver are slowed a little from in
juries sustained earlier in the sea
son.
Maentz, the biggest threat for the
Cards, is in good shape, and the
outcome of the Trojan struggle will
depend a lot upon the performance
he turns in.
Unlike the Southern California
frosh, Bradshaw's men cannot point
for the contest, since on the follow
ing week-end comes the Little Big
Game with California.
