## 
### 
You have heard of the foot
ball captain who sprained an
ankle playing ping-pong and
the Woolworth Building win
dow-washer who broke both
arms in a fall down his front
steps.
Such an incident happened
yesterday in Stanford's intra
mural touch-football program.
William Triplett, member of
the Grays, who had survived a
month of practice without in
jury, stepped in a gopher hole
and pulled a tendon in his leg.
Demoralized by the injury to
their captain, the S.A.E.'s drop
ped the game to El Toro 6 to 0.
