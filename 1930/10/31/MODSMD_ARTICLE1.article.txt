ANCONA, Italy, Oct. 30. (Jf) —
Twenty-seven persons were known
to be dead and more than 150 in
jured by an earthquake that shook
the Adriatic coast this morning. It
was believed that casualties in
towns unheard from at midday
would appreciably increase the to
tals.
At least 25 were on the official
list of dead with two others in iso
lated sections.
Official figures at midafternoon
placcd the injured at nearly 200.
The Ministry of the Interior sa ; d
every effort was being made to
reach the isolated towns with re
lief.
The earthquake struck shortly
after 8 o'clock this morning. The
tremors lasted twenty minutes.
Senigallia, like Ancona, suffered
heavy damage to property. Hardly
a house escaped.
The epicenter of the disturbance
was in the Adriatic Sea pear Scni
gallia, which so far as now known
was the hardest hit.
Military officials in neighboring
provinces rushed troops in motor
cars and trucks into the stricken
area.
Tt was at first feared that the iso
lated villages, as during July's
quake, would report the heaviest
casualties but, as town after town
was heard from, it began to appear
that the total of dead might not
reach more than two score.
Immediately after the quake ter
ror swept over the area, work was
suspended, and the population
flocked into the streets, refusing
to re-enter their homes in fear the
shocks would be repeated. In fact,
two additional flight tremors were
reported later at several points.
