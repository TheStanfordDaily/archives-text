Three times a year a few observ
ant Stanford students have occasion
to notice, during the chaos of regis
tration! the portrait of a bewhis
kered gentleman which hangs upon
the wall of the Administration
Building. Underneath the picture is
engraved "Thomas Welton Stan
ford." There is nothing in the por
trait to suggest ihe part which kero
sene lamps, sewing machines, real
estate, spiritualism, and a love of
painting played in the life of this
man who was a brother of Senator
Stanford and who was the donor of
the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery and (he Administration
Building.
Originally in business with his
brother, Thomas Welton Stanford
decided finally to attempt a sepa
rate venture. At that time, candles
were Ihe sole source of illumina
tion in the great mines of Australia.

Stanford made arrangements with
the owners to introduce a certain
type of kerosene lamp into the
mines. He chartered vessels to car
ry over the lamps and also fuel from
the United States. Eventually, he
deeided to go to Australia himself
in order to superintend his business
interests. He never made the return
voyage, but spent the remainder'of
his life on the island continent.
This enterprise was successful. He
built up a considerable fortune not
only from the sale of his lamps but
also from sewing machines. He in
vested his profit in Australian real
estate, in and around Melbourne,
with such success that he became
very wealthy.
He then became interested in spir
itualism. His offices and home in
Melbourne were the scenes of a
great many seances. His favorite
medium, formerly u "boot operative"
according to a clipping from an Aus
tralian paper, was Charles Bailey.
Bailey received at the seances evi
dences or rapports from "spirit-land."
An interesting situation resulted.
The customs officials attempted to
collect duties upon these heavenly
articles which included "everything
from an African fetish and the full
Sunday School dress of a cannibal
down to a live turtle and a score of
other "fandango" articles that were
in use thousands of years ago . . .
"Stanford denied any right to de
mand duty upon the articles and
the matter was finally dropped. But
he earned a reputation for himself
and was spoken of, by the Austra
lians, as "T. W. S. of Spook fame."
During his residence in Australia,
Thomas Welton Stanford had an
artist in his constant employ to paint
any landscapes that appealed to him.
The present exhibition in the art
gallery of Australian scenes is the
work of one such artist, J. W. Curtis.
Realizing the interest of his broth
er and sister-in-law in art, he built
a gallery for the University to house
his collection. The building, one of
the best-lighted and most adequate
ly-equipped of its kind, was com
pleted in 1917. but for some time re
mained a gallery v/ithout pictures.
The war intervened and the subse
quent risk of shipping the pictures
was so great that it was deferred.
