GREEN (.AH
Stanford has evidently picked no
mean opponent for November 20 in
Dartmouth College of Hanover,
New Hampshire. That Big Green
tidal wave has been swamping East
ern teams at a great rate so far this
season, being unscored upon until
Saturday's game with Harvard,
when the Crimson produced a
safety.
C asl your eyes over these figures:
Dartmouth 7!>, Norwich I)
Dartmouth 20, Hates (I
Dartmouth 74, Boston l\ 0
Dartmouth 52, Columbia 0
Dartmouth 7. Harvard 2
The balance of the Green's sched
ule is as follows:
Dartmouth vs. Yale, Nov. 1
Dartmouth vs. Allegheny, Nov. 8
Dartmouth vs. Cornell, Nov. 15
Dartmouth vs. Stanford, Nov. 29
Jackson Cannell's men have al
ready piled up 232 points to their
opponents 2, and with victories
over Harvard and Columbia to their
credit, hid fair to lie at least one of
the undefeated outfits of the East.
Vale and Cornell are the two hur
dles yet lo be surmounted, and the
game with Yale this week-end ap
pears (o lie the tougher of the two.
Dartmouth lias scheduled a day of
rest on the week-end prior to the
Stanford game, and early season
chatter indicated the New Hamp
shire men would point for Pop
Warner. All of which should make
things rather interesting for the Big
Bod Machine, provided it is func
-1 ioning.
The Sage of Hanover uses a varia
tion of tfie Warner system. Accord
ing (o the Eastern papers, Cannell
employs one wide-playing end and
one wing back, throws reverses on
both the tight and split side of the
line, and depends mostly on ofY
tacklc slants to gain ground.
Dartmouth has also tossed numer
ous short forward passes behind the
line of scrimmage with telling effect,
in accordance with the accepted
practices of the Warner system.
Even Nibs Price produced this play
for the California Bears, it being in
evidence against St. Mary's.
Handicapped by the Joss of one Al
ton K. Marstors of ail-America
reputation at (he start of the sea
son, the Green team seems lo have
produced numerous scoring threats,
judging by the healthy margin of
victory the boys piled up in their
early season (ills,
However, according to advices
from New England, Dartmouth de
pend.; primarily upon a running at
tack to advance the ball. Forward
passes are not forgotten, of course,
but line bucks, end runs, find the
like constitute the bulk of the Green
offense. We presume that the lack
ol emphasis placed upon the aerial
attack is due to the adverse weather
conditions of the East.

of hope for the Cardinals. It is
questionable il Mons. Cannell can
develop a satisfactory aerial attack
New England skies, and if not—
oi defense beneath the snow-flecked
well, a touchdown scored by a pass
counts just as much as any other
touchdown. —L. K., Jr.
