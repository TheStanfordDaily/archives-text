# Cardinal Freshmen Underdogs In Troy Contest
## YEARLING GRIDMEN DOPED SET-UP FOR INVADING TROJANS Hillman, White, Anderson Out Of Fray With Injuries 
### Stewart Crawford 
Going into the fray without the
services of two first string and three
"varsity" linemen, Coach Jimmy
"Rabbit" Bradshaw's yearling eleven
will be rated as having little chance
to turn back the Trojan invasion
at 2 o'clock tomorrow in the Sta
dium.
Hillman, freshman quarterback,
will be definitely out of the game
with a wrenched shoulder. White,
who has showed so well at half for
the babes, also will be unable to
play on account of injuries. Ander
son, who has been doing the booting
for the Cards from the fullback
position, has a bad leg, and will not
start, though he may see action
later in the game.
Lipscomb Quarter
To fill the quarter berth., Brad
shaw has shifted Lipscomb, who has
been working at half so far this
.season. Massey will be in his old
position at right half, while Minkler
will fill the gap left by the absence
of Anderson at full. Though these
two men have showed well in sub
stituting, they lack the experience
of the injured regulars, in the ab
sence of whom the Redshirts are
bound to be less effective.
In the line, Edelen at left end will
be definitely out of the tussle, Miller
starting in his place. Miller, an ex
Lowell High star, has filled this
berth since Edelen's injury in the
Bruin game, and his presence should
not noticeably weaken the Card line.
Trojan Babes Rest
Monsalve, regular at the other
wing position, will be replaced by
Packard, though he is in fair shape
and will undoubtedly play a good
part of the contest. Gould will be in
Alden's regular guard berth, while
Tarver, regular at the other guard,
will start, though he is in a some
what weakened condition. Should
his injuries bother him, he will be
replaced by Freeman, who will have
to work plenty hard to turn in as
good an exhibition as could the
veteran Tarver.
The young Thundering Herd rest
ed for the past two weeks in prepa
ration for the Card babe struggle,
while Bradshaw's warriors were
being battered by St. Mary's. The
Stanford yearling mentor has not
been able to point for the Trojan
tussle, since the Little Big Game
with California is slated for the fol
lowing week-end.
Ex-High-School Stars
The Southern California team will
present an aggregation of ex-prep
school stars. Ford Palmer, at light
end, Coach Aubrey Devine's ex-
Hollywood High satellite, will have
to be watched closely Saturday.
Other stellar grid veterans who will
bear watching are Erskine at left
end, all-state tackle from Iowa;
Sherman, former all-Minnesota full
back; and Fay, ex-all-city Los An
geles halfback.

day is as follows:
