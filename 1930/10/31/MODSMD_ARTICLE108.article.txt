# KNOCK OUT DROP-KICKERS
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
One of the prettiest plays in foot
ball is a neatly executed dropkick,
put over by the educated toe of
some player whose aim is as deadly
as his nerve is cool. If I were a
football coach, I would try to de
velop at least one sure-fire field goal
artist, preferably a drop-kicker, be
cause a place-kicker requires a
man to hold the ball and hence
lessens the defense for the' kick by
one player. Artists like the left
footed Vfe Kennard of Harvard, who
scored Percy Haughton's first tri
umph over Yale in 1908 by a suc
cessful drop-kick, are worth their
weight in gold, and I regret very

! much that the moving back of the
goal posts has practically done away
with this interesting phase of foot
ball. No varsity player scored more
I than three goals from the field last
\ season!
The thick-set Charley Erickley
| was a man who specialized highly
in drop-kicking. He was one of the
i stars of the great 1913 Harvard
team, and Coach Haughton used to
| work a little psychology on his ri
vals by sending Charley out before
the game to give a little exhibition
> of his prowess. Brickley would start
on the 24- or 30-yard lino at one
: side of the field and drop-kick foot

balls between the goal posts, clear
across the field to the other side.
By the time he had finished, Har
! vard's opponents were a bit wor
ried, to say the least!
While Brickley's five field goals
against Yale in the 1913 game (one
! was via the place-kick method) was
a great performance, the late Walter
Eckersall kicked five in a couple of
big games. "Frosty" Peters' 17 field
goals, all by drop-kicks, were made
when he was a freshman al the Uni
versity of Montana in 1924, against
Biilings Poly. "Frosty" later starred
for the University of Illinois. B. W.
, Trafford of Harvard also kicked five

field goals against Cornell in 1890.
"Red" Weaver of Centre College
kicked ninety successive goals after
touchdown, and "Paddy" Driscoll,
famous pro player, formerly of
Northwestern, once booted a aroo
kick over from 55 yards away wmle
out of his head!
Pat O'Dea takes the cake as the
best kicker of them all, however.
Pat played for Wisconsin, and in a
game with Northwestern in 1898 he
made a drop-kick of 62 yards, one
yard less than the present record,
held by Mark Payne of Dakota Wes
leyan, made in 1915. But Pat's most
remarkable stunt occurred in a
game with the Minnesota "Giants
of the North" in 1899. Pat caught a
punt on his own 40-yard line, and
just as Gil Dobie (now coach at
Cornell) was about to force him out
of bounds at the middle of the field,
Pat took a hasty glance at the goal
posts and then kicked a perfect field
goal from a most difficult angle
while running at almost top speed.
