# BALDWIN RE-ESTABLISHED AS LEADER OF BRITISH CONSERVATIVE FACTIONS
## Former Premier Triumphs at Meeting of Six Hundred Peers Over Turbulent Opposition by Vote of 4-1 ; Lack of Leadership Charged 
### 
I ONDON, Oct. 30. (/P) —Former Premier Stanley Baldwin, "Farmer
Baldwin" as he is sometimes affectionally called because of his pench
ant for pigs and primroses, triumphed today, temporarily at least, over a
turbulent opposition which was trying to oust him from leadership of
the Conservative Party. •
Some six hundred Conservative peers, members of the Commons and
ex-members of Commons who will be candidates in the next general
election, met in private at Caxton Hall and sat in judgment on the man

who has piloted them through
Stormy seas since the late Bonar
L; w resigned the leadership in 1923.
By a vote of about four to one—
462 to 116—a motion for a change
in leadership of the party was de
feated.
Baldwin thus weathered one of
the worst storms to beset the Con
servative Party in many years. Be
fore the vote the former Premier
had stalked into the crowded hall
with his bulky shoulders square and
wearing a grim expression.
His opponents charged him with
being unable to adapt himself to
changing conditions, with indecision
and with lack of inspiration in
leadership.
Baldwin's grimness melted into a
wistful smile when a large portion
of the throng, which included all of
the great Conservatives of England,
rose and cheered him for two min
utes.
He made a speech defending his
policies and dramatically demanded
that he be given a free hand in
dealing with fiscal matters. In other
words he refused to be hampered
in handling such problems as tar
iffs, now one of the paramount is
sues before the Imperial Conference.
