# SOCCER SQUAD FACES BEARS IN SERIES OPENER
## Improvement In Card Team Satisfactory Believes Harry Maloney 
### 
Accompanied by a squad of 20
soccer players, Coach Harry Ma
loney will invade the California
campus tomorrow seeking the scalp
of the Golden Bear. Cardinal and
Blue and Gold soccer elevens are
scheduled to clash at 12 o'clock in
the initial contest of a three-game
series.
Satisfaction with the improvement
shown by his forward line in the
shape of pasing and general of
fensive work together was expressed
by Maloney yesterday afternoon as
he watched the varsity go through
its final workout. He declared that
the team would give a good account
of itself tomorrow.
Smooth Practice
The forwards have been concen
trating on passing practice for the
past few days, and the results were
apparent yesterday. They were
working together much more
smoothly than previously, seeming
more sure in their passes. This is
a good omen, for the chief weakness
of the Cards up to the present has
been a lack ol co-operation on the
attack.
No worries are entertained with
respect to the defensive department
of play, it having been thoroughly
proved in early games that the Red
shirt eleven can rank with any in
repelling the assaults of opponents.
Halfbacks, fullbacks, and goalie are
all strong on the defense.
First With U.C.
Tomorrow's tilt will have a double
significance for the teams involved,
because it will count as one of the
games in the California Intercolle
giate Soccer Conference schedule
as well as being the first of the three
which will settle the annual ques
tion of supremacy between Stanford
and California in this branch of
sport. Little added incentive is
needed, however, for the members
of the two squads, since these meet
ings of Cardinal and Bear are the
high point of the soccer season and
have great traditional importance.
The following lineup was an
nounced yesterday to st;Â» t the game
for Stanford: Webster, goalie; Bums
and Dalton, fullbacks; Jackson,
right half; Christc-nsen, center half;
Plumb, left half; Nichols, outside
right; Falk, inside right; Miller, cen
ter forward; Eberhart (C), inside
left; Reynolds, outside left.
