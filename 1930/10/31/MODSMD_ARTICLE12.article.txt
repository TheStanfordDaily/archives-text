### 
IBRUSK, Oct. 30. (/P) â€”Too
many tomatoes in South Si
beria caused dire disaster in
the home of an eminent fam
ily in Siberia last week, ac
cording to Dr. Franz Buch
baum, German physician here.
The once Countess Anna
Serebrof is lying in bed today
suffering from extreme cirrho
sis of the liver, contracted as
a result of eating large quanti
ties of canned tomatoes which
have been imported this year
by the Soviet government at
reduced rates. The Count Sere
brof is about to bring suit
against a large canning con
cern in New Jersey.
