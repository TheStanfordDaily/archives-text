### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. (/P) â€”A
study looking to an "overhauling"
of the Indian educational system
with a view to increasing the asso
ciation of Indians with their white
fellows through attendance at pub
lic schools was sajd today by the
Department of Interior to have been
five-sixths completed in Oklahoma.
The Indian education situation
throughout the entire country will
be studied by the department in
carying out the policy of the pres
ent administration to facilitate ef
forts aiding the Indian toward nor
mal citizenship.
In Oklahoma the survey of the
five civilized tribes, constituting
100.000 of the Indian population has
been completed. Continuation of the
study, now going forward, will con
cern 20,000 other Indians in that
state.
Glenn W. Lewis, an Indian # and a
graduate of Haskell, was appointed
as day school representative for the
Seminoles and was charged with the
duty "to see to it that all Indian
children attend school and other
wise assist in working out local
problems."
The study showed much poverty
among the Chickasaws. Illness,
largely tuberculosis, was found in
15 per cent of the homes. Physicians
have been sent to examine the
homes where illness was found. Hos
pitalization has been provided for
many of those who needed it, while
others were treated at home.
