WASHINGTON. O.t. 30. (/I'). â€”
Secretary Mellon last night emerged
from his customary political silence,
to ask the voters to elect next Tues
day a Republican congress.
"It is not time for divided au
thority," the treasury chief told a
nation-wide radio audience. "It is
rather a time for strong and united
action and, in asking support for the
president and the administration, I
do so in the belief that in this way

we shall attain most quickly that
full measure of economic recovery
which is inevitable in a nation so
self-reliant and so Justifiably confi
dent of the future."
The secretary said the administra
tion was doing all possible to hasten
recovery lroni the business depres
sion and alleviate suffering from un
employment, but he cautioned h ; .
listeners.
"It cannot work miracles. The
most that any administration can do
is to keep the boat steady and head
ed in the right direction until the
storm blows over; and that the pre s
ident has shown he is well able to
do."
