# ELECTRIFIED TRAINS MAY END TIMETABLE
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 30. (A 3 ).—There is,
after all, a ray of hope for those
folks who puzzle over the modem
railway timetable and wonder what
is what, and which is which.
It was held out by J. A. Droege,
vice-president of the New York,
New Haven and Hartford railroad
who told electrical engineers he
hoped the time would come for the
abolishment of that "most tantalizing
of modern mysteries—the timeta
ble."
Shorter, faster and more frequent
trains are coming with the develop
ment of electrified lines, and pas
sengers in the future will just wait
for them as they do now for street
cars. Even Mr. Droege, who has
been in the railroad business for 25
years, admits that a timetable some
times stumps him.
