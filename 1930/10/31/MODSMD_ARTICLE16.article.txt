# LARGEST LAWN ON CAMPUS WILL BE MOWED TOMORROW
## 
### 
With the first cutting of its new
grown grass tomorrow, the largest
lawn on the campus will soon be
ready for use s the women's hockey
field, according to Henry Maier,
head university gardener.
All of the four and one-half acres
of grass directly adjoining the new
Women's Gymnasium", now under
construction, already has that soft,
green look typical of the fashionable
lawn, Maier, who has had a small
force of assistants working on the
lawn ever since the sed was planted
a month ago, declared. The new
hockey field lawn is more than one
third larger than 'the next biggest
lawn on the campus, the three-acre
plot fronting the Administration
Building.
