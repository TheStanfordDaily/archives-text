### 
LONDON, Oct. 30. â€”"It may
seem strange," Sir Ellis Hume Wil
liams, eminent divorce court law
yer, says in his autobiography, pub
lished today, "but I think women
are less faithful than men."
Other statements based, he says,
on long experience include: "Once
a woman who has loved one man,
has fallen out of love with him and
into love of another, there is no
cruelty known to any created being,
human or animal, to equal that
which she will treat the first man."
He gives his own advice to women
as to how to hold their husband's af
fections: "My experience is that a
woman who is careful to preserve
her physical attractions and will
take n little trouble to understand
and sympathize with her husband's
work or pleasure can keep him just
as long as she likes."
