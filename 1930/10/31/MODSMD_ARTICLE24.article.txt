# BRUENING AVOIDS BATTLE ON DEBT
## Evasion Taught District Government Victory 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 30. (/P>.â€”Chancellor
Bruening and his government have
evaded for the time being, at least, a
battle on the Reichstag floor over
opposition measures moving a mora
torium on German national debts
and suspension or revision of repa
ration payments.
The foreign affairs committee of
the Reichstag, reporting back on five
Fascist, Communist and Nationalist
measures of this character, rejected
all. But at the same time Rightist
Bourgeois members of the commit
tee passed a resolution urging the
government to end "the perilous sit
uation" in Europe in which "A dis
armed Germany is surrounded by
ever - increasing preparations for
war."
The resolution expressed "greatest
disillusionment" at the present status
of the disarmament movement and
stated the committee's expectation
that the government would work to
correct the situation, and establish
clearly whether foreign powers were
willing to "fulfill the stipulated ob
ligations in the Versailles Treaty."
The committee action was taken
during a meeting which lasted eight
hours. It was considered generally
as representing a distinct govern
ment victory, since with its pi'ecari
ous majority, open Reichstag debate
on treaty revision and a moratorium
might easily have precipitated the
cabinet's downfall.
