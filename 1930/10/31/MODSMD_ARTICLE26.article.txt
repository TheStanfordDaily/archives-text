# MUSICIANS NOW REHEARSING FOR ANNUAL ARMISTICE DAY PROGRAM
## 
### 
Stanford's observance of Armis
tice Day this year will be the pre
sentation of Brahms' "Requiem," in
the Memorial Church in the eve
ning, the University's most ambi
tious undertaking in the field of
choral music.
More than one hundred and sev
enty singers and instrumentalists
are rehearsing for the production,
the largest group ever assembled
here for an oratorio performance.
In order to insure accommoda
tion for the faculty and student
body in the church on the evening
of the oratorio, the committee on
public exercises has arranged to dis
tribute tickets in the Administra
tion Building on Thursday, Novem
ber 6. Members of the University
staff may apply for two tickets
each, by letter if they prefer, and
the committee will mail the tickets,
provided the applications are re -

ccived before November 6 and
stamped and addressed return en
velopes are enclosed.
Music lovers outside the Univer
sity may also apply and will re
ceive tickets, if any remain, after
November 6.
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, in charge of the music, says
that the enthusiasm on the part of
the participants and passed on by
the firends of the chorus and orches
tra already indicates a demand for
seats that will tax the capacity of
the Memorial Church.
The services will begin promptly
at 8:10 o'clock, and the ' Requiem"
proper at 8:15 sharp, concluding
about 9:30. The doors of the church
will be opened at 7:15 and no seats
will be reserved for ticket-holders
after 8 o'clock, any seats remaining
after that hour being available to
the general public.
