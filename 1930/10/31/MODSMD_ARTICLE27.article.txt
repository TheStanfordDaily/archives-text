Arriving in Los Angeles this
morning, Pop Warner's Big Red Ma
i chine will take it easy today in prep
aration for tonight's clash in the
Coliseum with U.C.L.A. The Bruin
' game will be more of a test for the
Cardinals than was expected at the
start of the season. Imbued with the
idea that they can win, Coach
i Spaulding's men promise to make it
interesting for the Warnermen.
But it will be a Stanford team
well able to copc with the Southern
outfit which takes the field tonight.
Exhibiting a spirit of grim deter
mination in their workouts this
week, the Stanford varsity has
served notice on all opponents that
it has not been demoralized by the
Trojan bout. Although handicapped
by injuries which will keep Captain
Ray Tandy, Phil Neill, Mar Albert
son, and possibly Perry Taylor on
the bench, the Redshirts can muster
sufficient strength to defeat the
Bruins.
50 Men Taken
With the exception of Henri La
borde and "Red" Targhetta, who
, were forced to remain behind be
cause of their studies, the entire
squad some 50 strong went south
; with the coaches and managers last
; night. Remaining in Los Angeles to
i watch the Trojans slaughter Den
ver, the Redshirts will arrive in Palo
Alto Sunday morning.
Warner announced no definite
line-up before the departure of the
I men, but indications arc that he will
! start the men listed above, who were
working out together at practice
yesterday. However, the Old Fox
also had a team composed of Neill
and Bush, ends; Bogue and Captain
Tandy, tackles; Bardin and Hand,
guards; Taylor, center; Baker, quar
terback; Caglieri and Rintala, half
i backs; and Rothert, fullback, run
ning through plays together.
A year ago, Warner started an all-
Southern group of men against the
Bruins, and this year may be no ex
ception. Injuries to the men, how
| ever, may put a crimp in the idea,
for (he majority of men on the crip
pled list are from the South.
Under the glare of the electric
lights, and with a dew-moistened
field to contend with, the Redshirts
j may be a little slow in starting, but
once under way the Stanford varsity
I should steam-roller the Blue and
; Gold eleven tonight.

squad some 50 strong went south
; with the coaches and managers last
; night. Remaining in Los Angeles to
i watch the Trojans slaughter Den
ver, the Redshirts will arrive in Palo
Alto Sunday morning.
Warner announced no definite
line-up before the departure of the
I men, but indications arc that he will
! start the men listed above, who were
working out together at practice
yesterday. However, the Old Fox
also had a team composed of Neill
and Bush, ends; Bogue and Captain
Tandy, tackles; Bardin and Hand,
guards; Taylor, center; Baker, quar
terback; Caglieri and Rintala, half
i backs; and Rothert, fullback, run
ning through plays together.
A year ago, Warner started an all-
Southern group of men against the
Bruins, and this year may be no ex
ception. Injuries to the men, how
| ever, may put a crimp in the idea,
for (he majority of men on the crip
pled list are from the South.
Under the glare of the electric
lights, and with a dew-moistened
field to contend with, the Redshirts
j may be a little slow in starting, but
once under way the Stanford varsity
I should steam-roller the Blue and
; Gold eleven tonight.
Radio KFRC of San Francisco
will broadcast the game tonight
between Stanford and C.C.1..A.
The broadcast is scheduled to
begin at 8:20 o'clock.

Arriving in Los Angeles this
morning, Pop Warner's Big Red Ma
i chine will take it easy today in prep
aration for tonight's clash in the
Coliseum with U.C.L.A. The Bruin
' game will be more of a test for the
Cardinals than was expected at the
start of the season. Imbued with the
idea that they can win, Coach
i Spaulding's men promise to make it
interesting for the Warnermen.
But it will be a Stanford team
well able to copc with the Southern
outfit which takes the field tonight.
Exhibiting a spirit of grim deter
mination in their workouts this
week, the Stanford varsity has
served notice on all opponents that
it has not been demoralized by the
Trojan bout. Although handicapped
by injuries which will keep Captain
Ray Tandy, Phil Neill, Mar Albert
son, and possibly Perry Taylor on
the bench, the Redshirts can muster
sufficient strength to defeat the
Bruins.
