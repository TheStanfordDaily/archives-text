# REVISE THOSE BY-LAWS NOW
## 
### 
Nominations for iln* student election to he held November 4
were made Wednesday and Thursday, partly as provided for in the
\.S.S.I', constitution and partly as outlined in the by-laws.
The nominating period opened Wednesday morning and closed
yesterday afternoon, all in due order according to the constitution
bin not according to the by-laws, which specify that the nominating
period shall be from Mondav morning until Thursday evening of
the week preceding the election.
The by-laws were observed, however, in that eight signatures
had in be affixed to every nomination. This provision was adopted
last spring to discourage the naming of too many candidates for
office. The advisability of this plan was questioned yesterday by
file D.\it.v. It was suggested that the present plan of nomination
might enable small political cliques to develop and that it might
hinder the naming for office of capable students.
The Executive Committee has the power to revise the by-laws.
To avoid confusion and to afford the election board a clear course
of procedure, the by-laws should be made to conform with the con
>titutiou. especially in the matter of the nominating period, before
another election is held.
Whether or not the eight signature requirement for nominations
i> a wise one is a matter for the F.xecutive C ommittee to decide.
