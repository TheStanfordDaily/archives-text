# GOOD-BY ST. MARY'S

(hi the heels of the disastrous Stanford-St. Mary's freshman
football of last Saturday, the 1 '"acuity Athletic Committee an
nounces that henceforth the yearlings may play only with freshman
teams representing member universities of the Pacific Coast Con
ference, and junior college and high school aggregations.
The committee could have saved many words, and been eqtiallv
as direct if they had announced, "\'o more freshman games with
St. Mary's or Santa Clara." What non--conference freshman teams
does the Stanford babe eleven ever meet other than those from the
two local Catholic institutions?
\ too strenuous schedule," was the reason presented for the
change. This will leave the first-year men only three games with
full four-year universities. The rest of the schedule presumably will
be padded out with junior college and high school teams.
Students and alumni of Stanford, and of St. Mary's and Santa
< lara want to sec healthy athletic competition continue. Hut appar
ently the Stanford athletic powers arc more interested in winning
conference championships than in putting on the best possible foot
ball show.
Stanford has frequently been accused of poor sportsmanship
since dropping St. Mary's from the varsity schedule three years
ago. Since learning of the faculty committee's latest action, it is
difficult still to believe that those accusations are entirelv incorrect.
