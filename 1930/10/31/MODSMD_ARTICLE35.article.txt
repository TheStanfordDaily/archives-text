CORONET. By Manuel KomrofY.
Coward-McCann. Inc. 1930. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
This is Sabbatini out Sabbatini
ed with something more. Outward
ly, it is the epic of the long career
of a jewel with a curse, the cultured
prototype of those cursed-gem
weallhy prince-chorus-girls stories
which seem to be meat and strong
drink to the readers of Sunday
Magazine Sections. Actually it is
the expression of an extraordinary
type of pessimistic philosophy. From
the time of its genesis under the
skilled hands of a Florentine gold-
I smith during the Renaissance, the
coronet exerts an evil influence on
all who come in contact with it a ltd
covet it.
Komroff portrays first the
ascendancy of military power with
a masterful portrait of Napoleon,
then the symbolic fall of the Empire
under the forces of art with Chopin
as its symbol, the arts bowing to
the force of intellect with Neitzche
as its chief aristocrat, and finally
the ascendancy of the power of
money. But the "insulted" who suf-
I fer indignities from these powers
always rise from the dead to con
found their torturers and avenge
"the silver whip."
This is a book to be read avidly
and assimilated gradually. The book
is far from mediocre and falls very
little, if at all, short of greatness.

EVERY MOTHER S SON. By Nor
man Lindsay. Cosmopolitan
Book Corporation. New York.
1930. (At the I'alo Alto Book
Shop.)
It is with considerable confidence
in the aptness of his choice that this
writer hereby nominates "Every
Mother's Son" by Norman Lindsay
as the worst book of the year.
The volume reaches what we must
hope will remain an unchallenged
i place at the peak of everything that
goes to make up a bad novel. It is
superficial, banal, stupid.
Its dialogue has all the sophisti
cation of the western thrillers dear
to youth. In treatment and style, it
resembles nothing quite as much as
those very cheap and flimsy ro
mances.
The so obvious suggestion that
i Norman Lindsay return to his more
familiar painting and etching is an
; extremely charitable one, scaring as
• it might both author and reader
further distress.
To our mind, anyone who can

read more than the first chapter or
two of "Every Mother's Son" de
serves either a prize or sympathy.

MAURICE GUEST. By Henry Han
del Richardson. W. W. Norton,
1930. (At the I"a!o Alto Book
Shop.)
The first "Maurice Guest," pub
lished twenty years ago, failed to
gain popularity beyond true literary
circles. Its essential qualities were
such, however, that Miss Richard
son revised her first novel, making
the second "Maurice Guest" a piece
of literature which may some day
be considered a masterpiece of the
early twentieth century.
Maurice was an Englishman who
believed in himself so strongly that
he left his staid, middle-class home
to develop his musical talent in
Leipzig. There he met Louise Duf
rayer, who displaced his ambitions
so that he lived only to make her
happy.
There is a strong influence of
tragic futility underlying each chap
ter, from the moment in 189-, when
Maurice stands in front of the
Gewandhaus, to the ironic conclu
sion. Maurice and his fellow musi
cians at the conservatory are peo
ple; thinking, living, not chattering
superficially on top of an organized
plot. They are far enough removed
from everyday 1930 life to give their
audience something worthwhile to
think about. —J. N.
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA. At the Curran
Theatre.
In the second regular Symphony
concert Basil Cameron tried his
hand at music of a more serious
nature than before, the light note
of the concert being sounded by
Mozart's gay overture to "Figaro."
The rest of the program was of an
intellectual nature. Brahms' Third
Symphony was played with great
spirit in the first and last move
ments and with calm lyricism in the
second and third. De Falla's "Nights
in the Gardens of Spain" with Henri
Deering at the piano was more or
less of a disappointment on account
of lack of depth in the composition,
but Loclfler's epic "Pagan Poem"
was given in its full grandeur.
This Sunday Cameron will give a
popular concert with a program of
old favorites such as "Traumerei,"
' Afternoon of a Faun," the ballet
music from "Rosamunde," and
' Tschaikowsky's "Italian Caprice."
