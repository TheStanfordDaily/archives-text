## "THANK YOU" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Let us pause in the midst of our
worry and struggle for higher edu
cation and express u little word of
appreciation for the splendid service
we receive at the Union Cellar; to
say nothing of the excellent food at
such reasonable prices.
Credit goes to Miss Ricker and her
able assistants, but let us not fot*get
the men behind the guns; those who
take our orders and those in the
kitchen that take such care to pre
pare the food so well. We are al
ways treated with the utmost cour

tesy and with prompt attention.
Even when some of us give our or
der:; after a hard night, and it must
be felt by those on the receiving
end of such commands, the smile
and courtesy of the waiters is never
lacking. We venture to say that not
one in town serves as
many as does the Cellar in so short
a time.
So in the future when things are
not so well with us and we give our
orders in a gruff manner, let's bene
fit by the smile we receive in re
turn. A CUSTOMER.
