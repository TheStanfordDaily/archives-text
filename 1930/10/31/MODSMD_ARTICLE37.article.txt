One by one, our mo;;I conspicuous
campus high-lights have been trail
ing off into the southland. The team
left last night, amidst much waving
of tear-soaked handkerchiefs. Do
you all appreciate the fact that along
with the varsity squad goes the
great, good A.S.S.U. president? And
of course a yell-leader or two. And
a good many worshiping hearts, of
a good many would-be athletes and
will-be Mrs.-Athletes.
Along with these, the flaming
spirit of the Stanford Press, and ac
cessories. have gone to a convention.
Once in a life-time, people! With
all these restraining influences out
of the way, it's your own fault if you
don't have a ripping good week-end
(after the eternal infernal Friday
exes are over).
We call it a stroke of genius—the
all-Row Jo'ly-Up held at the Chi
Omega house, last night. It's fun to
remember the days of jack o"lant
erns and v/itches (they used to play
Post Office and lots of other nice
games at Hallowe'en parties), any

'how. But the best of all this was
the fact that you could dance on the
thirtieth of the month, and not wor
ry about bankruptcy. Listen well,
all ye sorority girls: That house
showed real perception—and you
know, what the world of men wants
is UNDERSTANDING women . . .
It was suddenly brought home to
us, very forcibly, yesterday, what
marvelous training for college the
children who attend the campus
Elementary Grade School, are get
ting. Fraternity footballs bouncing
into their play-yard, at odd mo
ments—What a chance to observe
the lives of the great and great-to
be! Best of all though, is their prep
rration for actual campus life. The
first-graders play a game, every
morning, singing "Go in and out the
window" as; an accompaniment. ( You
remember that chorus, "Out the
window we must, go, My Fair
Lady"? Of course, by the time these
youngsters are ready for college,
Stanford may have graduated from
the age of lock-out rules. . . .

We call it a stroke of genius—the
all-Row Jo'ly-Up held at the Chi
Omega house, last night. It's fun to
remember the days of jack o"lant
erns and v/itches (they used to play
Post Office and lots of other nice
games at Hallowe'en parties), any

'how. But the best of all this was
the fact that you could dance on the
thirtieth of the month, and not wor
ry about bankruptcy. Listen well,
all ye sorority girls: That house
showed real perception—and you
know, what the world of men wants
is UNDERSTANDING women . . .
It was suddenly brought home to
us, very forcibly, yesterday, what
marvelous training for college the
children who attend the campus
Elementary Grade School, are get
ting. Fraternity footballs bouncing
into their play-yard, at odd mo
ments—What a chance to observe
the lives of the great and great-to
be! Best of all though, is their prep
rration for actual campus life. The
first-graders play a game, every
morning, singing "Go in and out the
window" as; an accompaniment. ( You
remember that chorus, "Out the
window we must, go, My Fair
Lady"? Of course, by the time these
youngsters are ready for college,
Stanford may have graduated from
the age of lock-out rules. . . .
One by one, our mo;;I conspicuous
campus high-lights have been trail
ing off into the southland. The team
left last night, amidst much waving
of tear-soaked handkerchiefs. Do
you all appreciate the fact that along
with the varsity squad goes the
great, good A.S.S.U. president? And
of course a yell-leader or two. And
a good many worshiping hearts, of
a good many would-be athletes and
will-be Mrs.-Athletes.
Along with these, the flaming
spirit of the Stanford Press, and ac
cessories. have gone to a convention.
Once in a life-time, people! With
all these restraining influences out
of the way, it's your own fault if you
don't have a ripping good week-end
(after the eternal infernal Friday
exes are over).
