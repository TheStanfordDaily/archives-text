# HOBO HOSTEL MAY BE ESTABLISHED IN P.A. FOR UNEMPLOYED
## 
### 
Plans for a "hobo camp" which
will free Palo Alto of house-to
house beggars and petty thievery
will be submitted to the city coun
cil lor consideration November 10.
This statement came from J. F.
Byxbee, city engineer of Palo Alto,
chairman of the committee in charge
of the plans.
"The unemployment situation in
Palo Alto and vicinity is becoming
serious," Byxbee said yesterday,
"and large numbers of tramps and
beggars in the city make it very
annoying for housewives. The 'hobo
camp,' which will be situated in the
corporation yard west of the freight
depot, will afford lodging, light
work, and food for these transients."
Tramp Refuge
A refuge for tramps has been tried
before in Palo Alto, Byxbee .said.
The Hostel, a rude frame building
situated on the proposed sight of
the new "hobo camp," ran success
fully throughout 1915-17 and was
discontinued only because of the
war. Yearly appropriations were
granted the Hostel, the city engineer
said, and an effort was made to
make the institution self supporting.
Ground was leased from the Uni
versity on which potatoes were
grown, the proceeds going to the
upkeep of the organization.
During the three years in which ,
it operated, the Hostel served meals
to several thousand men and sup
plied lodging to many others. Also,
during that period, Palo Alto city
records show a substantial decrease
in complaints from families annoyed
by tramps and beggars.
Second Camp
Present plans for the new "hobo
camp" are on the same general lines
as those of the original Hostel. The
building will be a frame structure
containing bunks for fifty men.
Showers will be installed and a
sanitary bath required of each
"hobo" desiring lodging. In conjunc
tion with the bunkhouse will be a
dining room and kitchen. Grounds
surrounding the camp will be uti
lized for growing vegetables. Emer
gency employment in the form of
street work, grading, and work on
the grounds will be done by men
from the camp.
Members of the committee are
Paul OfTenhiser, secretary; Oscar
Campbell, a member of the board
of public works of Palo Alto; Mrs.
Roy Folger, active in philanthropic
work in Palo Alio; Chief of Police
H. F. Zink, Clark Congdon, and R.
W. Evans.
The committee will meet sometime
before November 10 to consider fur
ther plans, OfTenhiser said last j

surrounding the camp will be uti
lized for growing vegetables. Emer
gency employment in the form of
street work, grading, and work on
the grounds will be done by men
from the camp.
Members of the committee are
Paul OfTenhiser, secretary; Oscar
Campbell, a member of the board
of public works of Palo Alto; Mrs.
Roy Folger, active in philanthropic
work in Palo Alio; Chief of Police
H. F. Zink, Clark Congdon, and R.
W. Evans.
The committee will meet sometime
before November 10 to consider fur
ther plans, OfTenhiser said last j
night.
Plans for a "hobo camp" which
will free Palo Alto of house-to
house beggars and petty thievery
will be submitted to the city coun
cil lor consideration November 10.
This statement came from J. F.
Byxbee, city engineer of Palo Alto,
chairman of the committee in charge
of the plans.
"The unemployment situation in
Palo Alto and vicinity is becoming
serious," Byxbee said yesterday,
"and large numbers of tramps and
beggars in the city make it very
annoying for housewives. The 'hobo
camp,' which will be situated in the
corporation yard west of the freight
depot, will afford lodging, light
work, and food for these transients."
Tramp Refuge
A refuge for tramps has been tried
before in Palo Alto, Byxbee .said.
The Hostel, a rude frame building
situated on the proposed sight of
the new "hobo camp," ran success
fully throughout 1915-17 and was
discontinued only because of the
war. Yearly appropriations were
granted the Hostel, the city engineer
said, and an effort was made to
make the institution self supporting.
Ground was leased from the Uni
versity on which potatoes were
grown, the proceeds going to the
upkeep of the organization.
During the three years in which ,
it operated, the Hostel served meals
to several thousand men and sup
plied lodging to many others. Also,
during that period, Palo Alto city
records show a substantial decrease
in complaints from families annoyed
by tramps and beggars.
Second Camp
Present plans for the new "hobo
camp" are on the same general lines
as those of the original Hostel. The
building will be a frame structure
containing bunks for fifty men.
Showers will be installed and a
sanitary bath required of each
"hobo" desiring lodging. In conjunc
tion with the bunkhouse will be a
dining room and kitchen. Grounds
surrounding the camp will be uti
lized for growing vegetables. Emer
gency employment in the form of
street work, grading, and work on
the grounds will be done by men
from the camp.
