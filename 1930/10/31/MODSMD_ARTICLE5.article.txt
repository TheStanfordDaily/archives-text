Â» , ...
Suffering from serious injuries re
ceived when the car in which he
was travelling crashed into an auto j
coming from the opposite direction |
on the state highway just south oi
Mayfield yesterday afternoon, Pro
fessor J. W. Bingham of the Law ,
School is today being treated in the
Palo Alto Hospital. Last night it
was feared by attending physicians
that Professor Bingham sustained a
fractured skull.
Thomas F. McGuire of San Fran
cisco, driver of the northbound ve
hicle, escaped without injury, while
his wife, who was beside him at
the tune of the accident, was seri
ously injured internally and was !
taken to the Palo Alto Hospital.
G. L. MacKenzie, of Palo Alto, I
who was driving the machine in j
which Professor Bingham was rid- |
ing, sustained only minor cuts and
bruises.
MacKenzie was proceeding south- !
ward toward Los Altos at approxi- j
mately 30 miles per hour when he
turned out to pass a truck, thinking J
he had time to beat the swiftly ap
proaching McGuire car. It bore j
down upon him sooner than he ex- j
pected, however, and in attempting J
to avoid a head-on collision, Mac-
Kenzie swerved and was sideswiped. j
The full extent of Mrs. McGuire's !
injuries had not been determined i
late last night.
