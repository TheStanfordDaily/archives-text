# STUDENT'S LIFE IS SAVED BY CHANCE IDEA OF NOVELIST
## Antidote Administered By Doctor; Kendrick Recovering 
### 
That Mari on Kendrick, Stanford, |
'lil, is alive today is perhaps due to ;
the fact that Charles G. Norris, Palo j
Auto author, decided to write a j
story with a character who was to ;
take poison, and so consulted a phy
sician about an effective and pain
less poison.
When Kendrick was taken to the
Pitlo Alto hospital, suffering from j
some unknown malady, the doctor
called on the case, Granville Wood, ,
diagnosed it at once as atropine poi
soning and was able to administer i
the antidote immediately. This rare
poison had been his suggestion to ,
the author. The doctor had then
refreshed his memory by reading up
on atropine, its effects, and anti- ;
dotes. Noting that pilocarpine, a '
drug not commonly carried in a doc- j
tor's kit, was the antidote, he had
secured some for his satchel.
The poison, it was discovered after
analysis of the cold medicine which j
Kendrick had taken, had been put
into the compound through a drug
gist's error.
The patient is expected to remain
in the Palo Alto Hospital for several |
days, but was reported yesterday to !
be making satisfactory progress to- t
ward recovery.
