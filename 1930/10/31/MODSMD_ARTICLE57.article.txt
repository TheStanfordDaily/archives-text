i Letters written home may be used

data on college life as were those ol
two of the first inmates of Roble
and Encina. Excerpts from"The
First Year at Stanford" published
by the English Club in 1905 reveal
j familiar trials and tribulations.
' Writes Jack: "We have to go after
j dark for our grapes now. There's a
j mounted watchman but it's a big
place and easy hiding under the big
vines . . . The othor night, I busted
: into a room by mistake. It belonged
to a prof and he and another prof
! were at the table and they had a
big newspaperful of grapes of the
vineyard color and they were
munching away as calmly as though
they had bought them from Bracchi,
the fruitman at Mayfield. 1 sneaked."
Encina Dining Room
"Just now, the girls' hall isn't fin
| ished and they are eating over here.
We have to wait for them to get
through. They sit at three tables
near the doors, and we get up on

! the stairs and watch them through
the windows. It makes them aw
fully uncomfortable. We call it
'seeing the hens fed.'
"Some of the fellows have left
their visiting cards under their
plates. There is a fellow here from
Berkeley who says they call the
girls 'co-eds' up there. He is dead
against girls at college but it doesn't
bother me one way or the other.
The board does, though!
"Things don't come hot and it's
pretty much the same kind of food.
I You'd think you were at some kind
of celebration in Ventura county.
You know that's the biggest bean
county in the world . . . We have
cold beef and mutton and more
mutton and beef that isn't supposed
i to be cold; lots of all right milk . . .
There are two kinds of pudding, al
ternating. One is a kind of wet
cake, peppered with dried currants,
the other we call 'tombstone pud
ding.' It's a slab of blanc mange
; floating in a rosy hair-oil."

of celebration in Ventura county.
You know that's the biggest bean
county in the world . . . We have
cold beef and mutton and more
mutton and beef that isn't supposed
i to be cold; lots of all right milk . . .
There are two kinds of pudding, al
ternating. One is a kind of wet
cake, peppered with dried currants,
the other we call 'tombstone pud
ding.' It's a slab of blanc mange
; floating in a rosy hair-oil."
i Letters written home may be used
at some future dale for historical
data on college life as were those ol
two of the first inmates of Roble
and Encina. Excerpts from"The
First Year at Stanford" published
by the English Club in 1905 reveal
j familiar trials and tribulations.
' Writes Jack: "We have to go after
j dark for our grapes now. There's a
j mounted watchman but it's a big
place and easy hiding under the big
vines . . . The othor night, I busted
: into a room by mistake. It belonged
to a prof and he and another prof
! were at the table and they had a
big newspaperful of grapes of the
vineyard color and they were
munching away as calmly as though
they had bought them from Bracchi,
the fruitman at Mayfield. 1 sneaked."
Encina Dining Room
"Just now, the girls' hall isn't fin
| ished and they are eating over here.
We have to wait for them to get
through. They sit at three tables
near the doors, and we get up on

! the stairs and watch them through
the windows. It makes them aw
fully uncomfortable. We call it
'seeing the hens fed.'
"Some of the fellows have left
their visiting cards under their
plates. There is a fellow here from
Berkeley who says they call the
girls 'co-eds' up there. He is dead
against girls at college but it doesn't
bother me one way or the other.
The board does, though!
"Things don't come hot and it's
pretty much the same kind of food.
