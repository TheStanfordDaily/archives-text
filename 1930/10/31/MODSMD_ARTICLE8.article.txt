# DEAN DEFENDS STATUE FROM RIOTING TIGERS
## 'Christian Student' Dragged Through Streets At Princeton Riot 
### 
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 30. (/P). —
A statue of "The Christian Student,"
presented to Princeton University
by the late Cleveland Dodge, is in
hiding somewhere in Princeton to
day—in some spot where Dean
Christian Gauss hopes some of his
students won't find it.
The statue was lifted into a truck
by ten university workmen late last
night at the close of a student dem
onstration and hidden at the request
of the dean, who has a long list of
names he's going to read out loud,
probably today, when some of the
students are called to account.
It all started innocently enough.
The football team, the sports pages
shov.', lost to Brown, Cornell and the
Navy, all in a row. One of the col
lege councils thought the team
needed inspiration so the student
body was packed into Alexander
Hall. Even then the freshmen were
excited. They threw some of their
seat cushions on the heads of upper
classmen, from the balcony.
At the close of the meeting Presi
dent John Grier Hibben said he had
seen a lot of enthusiastic meetings,
but last night's was better than all
the others. That was before the
riot.
With a rush, all but 300 of the
students who were presumed to be
studying, swept over the campus,
started a bonfire between Alexander
and Witherspoon Halls, several other
smaller ones on Nassau street, and
pushed automobiles to the middle
of the street t'o block traffic.
Some of them jumped to the run
ning boards of two New York to
Philadelphia busses and locked them
back and forth while the passengers
for the most part, appreciated the
joke.
A march toward the Hun School
was halted by threats of the Dean,
who appeared not too vexed so long
as his charges kept within bounds.
When everything appeared to be
calm and settled, however,, several
students mounted the pedestal of the
statue back of the library and tore
the heavy copper creation of Daniel
Chester French from its foundation
and dragged it several hundred
yards to Nassau street, where the
dean and proctors caught up with
them again. More names were added
to the list. The students at no time
appeared to be disrespectful, how
ever, and gave the dean a rousing
cheer whenever he appeared, which
was often. Once, over the academic
roar, he managed to raise his voice
sufficiently to say, "Enthusiasm of
this sort at football games might
bring results in victory."
No policemen took part in the en
gagement and no one was injured.

started a bonfire between Alexander
and Witherspoon Halls, several other
smaller ones on Nassau street, and
pushed automobiles to the middle
of the street t'o block traffic.
Some of them jumped to the run
ning boards of two New York to
Philadelphia busses and locked them
back and forth while the passengers
for the most part, appreciated the
joke.
A march toward the Hun School
was halted by threats of the Dean,
who appeared not too vexed so long
as his charges kept within bounds.
When everything appeared to be
calm and settled, however,, several
students mounted the pedestal of the
statue back of the library and tore
the heavy copper creation of Daniel
Chester French from its foundation
and dragged it several hundred
yards to Nassau street, where the
dean and proctors caught up with
them again. More names were added
to the list. The students at no time
appeared to be disrespectful, how
ever, and gave the dean a rousing
cheer whenever he appeared, which
was often. Once, over the academic
roar, he managed to raise his voice
sufficiently to say, "Enthusiasm of
this sort at football games might
bring results in victory."
No policemen took part in the en
gagement and no one was injured.
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 30. (/P). —
A statue of "The Christian Student,"
presented to Princeton University
by the late Cleveland Dodge, is in
hiding somewhere in Princeton to
day—in some spot where Dean
Christian Gauss hopes some of his
students won't find it.
The statue was lifted into a truck
by ten university workmen late last
night at the close of a student dem
onstration and hidden at the request
of the dean, who has a long list of
names he's going to read out loud,
probably today, when some of the
students are called to account.
It all started innocently enough.
The football team, the sports pages
shov.', lost to Brown, Cornell and the
Navy, all in a row. One of the col
lege councils thought the team
needed inspiration so the student
body was packed into Alexander
Hall. Even then the freshmen were
excited. They threw some of their
seat cushions on the heads of upper
classmen, from the balcony.
At the close of the meeting Presi
dent John Grier Hibben said he had
seen a lot of enthusiastic meetings,
but last night's was better than all
the others. That was before the
riot.
With a rush, all but 300 of the
students who were presumed to be
studying, swept over the campus,
started a bonfire between Alexander
and Witherspoon Halls, several other
smaller ones on Nassau street, and
pushed automobiles to the middle
of the street t'o block traffic.
