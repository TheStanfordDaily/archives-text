# DIGESTIVE POISONS AS CAUSE OF DEAFNESS PROVED BY GOTTLIEB

CHICAGO, Oct. 30. </Pi—Discov
ery of digestive poisons that could
cause more than one form of deaf
ness was made public today. The
poisons arise from incomplete in
testinal digestion.
The new field of attack upon im
paired hearing was reported to the
American Academy of Ophthalmol
ogy and Ocolaryngology by Dr.
Mark J. Gottlieb of New York.
He told also of a treatment in
these cases which caused some
"startling improvements" in hear
ing.
"The findings," he said, "are the
result of eight years' investigation
in the Hard of Hearing Research
Clinic at Beth Israel Hospital, New
York.
"The fact that the intestinal con
tents of certain deafened people arc
poisonous to guinea pigs on injec
tions and produce, among other
things, bleeding and inflammation in
the hearing organs of these animals,
adds another link to the chain of

evidence that deafness in a large
number of patients is due to some
poison arising in the intestines."
In a "very thorough examination"
of 41 deafened persons, Dr. Gottlieb
said, 31 were found deficient in pan
creatic ferments.
"In many instances," he went on.
"the results showed that the pa
tients had little or no digestion of
one or more than three important
classes of foods—proteins, sugars,
and fats.
"Twenty-three of the 31 were
treated by administration of potent
pancreatic extract and some very
startling improvements resulted in
20 of these.
"Many items in the problem still
need clarification," he said. "It will
require co-ordinated efforts of the
chemist, biologist, pathologist, oph
thalmologist, internist, and otologist
to investigate the obscure problems
which still lurk in the darkness of
this important subject. For this
much assistance will be required."
