## Service Station Employees Contradict Report 
### 
Following the 3500-acre forest fire
back of King's Mountain in Prismo
Canyon, San Mateo county authori
ties were today looking for a man
believed to have started the fire. A
report to Constable Fred Simmons
of Half Moon Bay of a man driving
to the spot where the fire started
before the bla/.e was discovered, has
started the man-hunt.
According to employees of the
King's Mountain Service Station,
however, the blaze spread from a
brush fire started by one of the
canyon residents, which fire later
grew out of control.
Men at the service station stated
that they turned in an alarm Tues
day evening to Fire Warden Bert
Werder, but the warden failed to
investigate the blaze. On Wednesday
and Thursday, they said, the fire
and smoke continued, but they
thought the warden was on the
scene of the blaze.
Friday night, when they noticed
that the blaze had grown still
larger, they again notified Werder.
The fire, which blackened about
3500 acres of chaparral and men
aced over 100 homes, was well under
control Saturday night and yester
day morning. At one time as many
as 600 men were fighting the fire.
This morning, only a few scat
tered blazes remained, with an ade
quate number of men to prevent
further spread of the flames.
