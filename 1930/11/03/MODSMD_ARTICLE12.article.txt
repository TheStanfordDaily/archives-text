# FRESHMEN ORGANIZE TO ARRANGE TALKS WITH FACULTY MEN
## 
### 
Approximately 40 freshmen who
attended the meeting in Encina
Lobby last night at which Gilbert
Wrenn, secretary of the University's
vocational guidance department,
spoke and conducted an open forum
on "College Education from the Vo
cational Standpoint" have organized
a committee for the puropose of
arranging similar informal hours
with faculty men.
Since there was considerable dis
cussion among freshmen as to the
value of citizenship and as to
whether it should be a required
course for every first-year student,
the group decided to ask Dr. E. E.
Robinson, head of the citizenship
and history departments, to lead the
next meeting.
The subject of his talk and the
discussion will probably be some
question concerning the importance
of the study of citizenship. The date
for this meeting has not been defi
nitely settled, but it will be either
next Sunday night or the following
Sunday night..
In case Dr. Robinson cannot ar
range to be present on either of
these days, Dr. H. J. Ryan, professor
of electrical engineering and head
of the Ryan Electrical Laboratory,
will be invited to speak.
