# STANFORD STUDENT ESCAPES UNINJURED IN AUTO COLLISION
## 
### 
An automobile collision at the in
tersection of Palm Drive and the
State Highway last night involved
Marvin Burnett, Stanford student,
and E. P. Lamar of Salinas. No in
jitries resulted, and neither car was
badly damaged, although Lamar
was forced to place his car in a
garage, and continue his trip south
by stage.
Burnett emerged from a service
station at the northeast of the in
tersection, according to witnesses,
and crossed squarely in front of
Lamar, who was south bound on
the highway. Lamar hit Burnett
broadside, throwing both cars into
Palm Drive.
