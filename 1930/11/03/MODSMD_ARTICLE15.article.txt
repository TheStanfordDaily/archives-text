# PAGE FROM LOG OF R-101 PRODUCES SENSATION AT PUBLIC DISASTER INQUIRY
## Writer Was Recording Oil Pressure of Motor When Crash Occurred, Attorney General Shows; R-38 Mistakes Thought Avoided 
### 
I ONDON, Oct. 30. (/P) â€”A tattered bit of paper caused a sensation today
in the public inquiry assembled to determine the cause of the R-101
disaster three weeks ago.
Whereas the popular opinion was that no evidence remained in the
charred remnants of the great dirigible, which crashed and burned on a
French hillside with a total loss of 48 lives, Sir William Jowitt, the attor
ney general, read a sheet from one of the logs of the airship.
"This shows that No. 4 engine at 2 o'clock in the morning (nine minutes
before the crash) was revolving at cruising speed," Sir William said, "but

the oil pressure, recorded at 3 when
it should have read 30 or 33, indi
cated that the writer did not have
time to finish the figure before the
crash."
Testimony by Professor J. Bair
.stow, chairman of the committtee
which passed on the airworthiness
of the R-101, showed that the mis
takes which sent the dirigible R-38
to destruction with a British-Amer
ican crew in 1921 were thought to
have been avoided in the construc
tion of the R-101.
Questioned by the solicitor gen
eral, Sir Richard Stafford Cripps,
Professor Bairstow said he was a
member of the committee which de
cided that the R-38 buckled and the
findings of that investigation served
as a basis for laboratory experi
ments to guide the designers of the
R-101 and its sister ship, the R-100.
