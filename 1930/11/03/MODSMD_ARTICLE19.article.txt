# G.O.P. GROUP FACES LOSS IN CONGRESS
## Unemployment Situation To Be Important Factor In Election 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (/P).—The
political nerves of the nation are
tightening for tomorrow's vote on
who's to be who in Congress and in
32 state capitals next year.
Party leaders agree the Demo
crats will bolster their strength in
both the Senate and House, but only
the count can reveal whether the
present Republican majorities will
be-overturned.
Statements published today vivify
anew the debate on the course of
President Hoover and his adminis
tration as to the tumble of business
and the rise of unemployment. Two
Republican spokesmen called again
lor his vindication at the polls and
a Democrat for repudiation.
No Democratic Program
Leaders of both parties remain
adamant in expressing confidence of
the verdict.
Secretary Lamont, at Washington,
brought up the 1932 presidential
election—about which many conjec
tures have been raised during the
campaigns. He asserted the Demo
cratic party was without a program
now, would be if it organized Con
gress, and—looking ahead two years
—would "continue to obstruct" the
Hoover program.
Senator George of Georgia, on the
other hand, said the Democrats
"stand ready to go the limit" to re
lieve unemployment. His statement
assailed the administration's han
dling of that problem, as well as its
farm relief and tariff measures.
Smith Blamed
Representative Wood, in Chicago,
as chairman of the Republican Con
gressional Committee, charges Al
fred E. Smith and James M. Cox
with misrepresenting the adminis
tration's policy in connection with
the industrial situation. They were
the Democratic presidential nomi
nees in 1928 and 1920.
Meanwhile, the organized dry
forces last night issued a call for
support of candidates favoring na
tional prohibition. The Anti-Saloon
League headed the list of the six or
ganizations.
"We join in the declaration," the
statement said, "that the friends of
prohibition will not compromise the
principle of national, constitutional
prohibition."
