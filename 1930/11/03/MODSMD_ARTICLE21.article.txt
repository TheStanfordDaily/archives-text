# LOCAL BANKERS FIND STUDENTS CARELESS IN HANDLING FINANCES

### SHERIDAN HEGLAND 
the average Stanford student re
ceives approximately $1,250 in
checks from home annually, accord
ing to estimates of Palo Alto bank
ers.
Usually parents mail a $250 draft
at the beginning of each school
quarter, sending the rest in monthly
installments. Few students arc en
trusted with lump sums for the
quarter, bank tellers assert.
Consequently Stanford students,
who draw between twenty and
thirty checks a month, rarely find
their accounts above fifty dollars,
D. W. Buchan, manager of one Palo
Alto bank, reported.
Of course, he continued, most
checks, outside of the tuition fees
and board and room payments, arc
small, one or two dollars being the
rule.
Moreover, college students arc
especially careless in the matter of
overdrafts, perhaps more careless
than any other class, bankers agree.
Never quite certain how much thev

have, they are sometimes inclined
to take a chance on a check going
through.
The Union alone handles between
one and twenty "hot" checks or
overdrafts a day. Due to this ten
dency of college youths most Palo
Alto merchants refuse to cash stu
dent checks for more than two dol
lars.
Francis J. Moore, Palo Alto bank
teller, is completing u report on
student accounts, to be submitted to
his bank's oflice at San Francisco,
in which he advises the issuing of
"credit coupons" to students instead
of deposit accounts.
The credit coupons would be simi
lar to traveler's ehecques, but would
be made out in one- and two-dollar
denominations. This system would
do away with the large amount of
bookkeeping now necessary on stu
dent accounts. Students could more
readily check their balances, and,
since overdrafts would be impos
sible, would find no difficulty in
cashing checks.
