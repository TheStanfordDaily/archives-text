# GAIETIES CHORUS POSITIONS OPEN
## Second Tryouts To Be Held Tonight--Helvenston 
### 
Second tryouts for the chorus of
the Big Game Gaieties of 1930 will
be held'at 7 o'clock this evening in
the Assembly Hall, according to
Harold Helvenston, director of dra
matics.
All women students, except first
quarter freshmen, are urged to try
out at that time. Mr. Helvenston
hopes to have many people to choose
from for work in this production,
and expressed his belief that many
girls who do not try out could win
places in the chorus, if they appear
before final selections are made.
Those who attended the tryouts
Friday and who are asked to return
tonight are:
Mary Abbott, Muriel Bartlett,
Ruth Beede, Ruth Clark, Barbara
Coltrin, Catherine Crary, Sue Betty
Dunlap, Harriet Eckert, Louise
Fowle, Harriet Geary, Mary Gibson,
Gladys Gillig, Katherine Haiwood,
Adrienne Hawkins, Betty Hewit,
Gertrude Laidlaw, Louise Taft, Mary
McCleave, Constance Morse, Doro
thy Zitkowski, Mildred West, Mary
Wittenberg, Mary Jane Pollock,
Mary Lou Watson, Frances Wallace,
Margaret Newcomer, Ruth Lockett.,
and Charlotte Long.
Mr. Helvenston specially requests
that all tryoutees appear in gym
shorts, rompers or some other brief
and comfortable dancing costume,
as most of the rehearsal time will be
devoted to dancing practice.
