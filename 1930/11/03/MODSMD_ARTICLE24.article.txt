# FRESHMAN SOCCER TEAM TIES U.C. IN HARD-FOUGHT TILT
## 
### 
Captain Arthur Hearn saved the
Stanford freshman soccer team from
defeat at the hands of the Univer
sity of California freshmen Saturday
by the exceedingly slim margin of
15 seconds when he slipped in the
tying goal of a 2-2 game with just
that length of time left to play.
| Hearn's goal came as the climax
of a hard-fought tilt in which the
Bear Cubs had held the advantage
for the greater part of the time but
failed to annex a victory because of
the fighting defense put up by the
Card halfbacks, Hitchcock, Nicoll,
and Spoehr, and the occasional
strong offensive thrusts by Hearn,
Dodington, Knecht, and Moy.
Stanford scored in the first three
minutes of play on a fumble by
Mendoza, Bear fullback, which
Dodington pounced upon and con
verted into a goal. A little later
Hurtado, inside left, who was the
big star of the game for California,
drove a kick into the net past Low,
Card goalie, to tie the count.
The score was 1-1 at half time,
but in the final period the Blue and
Gold eleven threatened constantly
to tally. Finally Reichel took a
pretty kick from Singh and headed
it in for a goal, giving the Cali
fornia babes a 2-1 lead.
