# GRIDMEN BACK AFTER DEFEAT OF BRUIN TEAM
## U.C.L.A. Shows Strength In Holding Cardinals To 20-0 Win FACE HUSKY INVASION 
### Len Kullmann 
Back from the glare of the Lo:;
Angeles Coliseum, the Stanford
football squad will lose no time to
day in settling down to the serious
business of preparing for the Wash
ington Huskies. A 20-0 victory over
the U.C.L.A. eleven reposes to their
credit on the right side of the ledger,
the fruits of the Southern invasion,
and no injuries mar the debit col
umn.

With the exception of Mar Albert
son, whose knee trouble incurred in
the Southern California game may
keep him on the sidelines, and
Henri Laborde, likewise out with a
bad knee, all of the men should be
in shape for Washington Saturday.
Bruins Improve
Stanford's one and only Southern
invasion of the past week-end pre
sents two possible viewpoints for the
Stadium cynics. Either Stanford,
whose 20-0 win is dwarfed by
U.S.C.'s score of 52-0, is as weak
as she seemed in the Trojan game;
or the Bruins are a much improved
outfit.
Holding the Cards to a 7-0 score
at half time with a stubborn de
fense, the Bruins looked weak only
on two occasions in the second half
when Rothert rambled to touch
downs from 56 and 38 yards out.
But followers of the Big Red Ma
chine must bear in mind first: that
Stanford had reached a certain
psychological peak a week previous;
second: that the wet field and new
surroundings had much to do with
the play of the men; and third: that
it was a miscellaneous team in the
game at all times.
Comparative Scorcs
Returns from the North indicate
that Oregon State bowed to Wash
ington State by the same margin
the Beavers lost to Stanford. On
the basis of such comparative
scores, it is impossible to arrive at
any conclusion regarding the merits
of the different teams in the Coast
Conference. But one thing is cer
tain, that the University of Wash
ington eleven will afford the War
ner men plenty of opposition on No
vember 11.
Little Bill Laird at left half was
the bright and shining Ift*hl: of the
Cardinal outfit Friday, even putting
the incandesccnts of the Coliseum
to shame. Running the team like a
captain handles his ship, Laird may
prove to be the answer to Stan
ford's prayers for a field general.
Clark Makes Gains
Another not-so-heavy lad who
has been cooling his heels on the
bench for a while, one William
Clark, likewise was given an op
portunity to strut his stuff. Wil
liam bobbed up with the old pass
defense in the fourth quarter, and
turned in some neat gains from
scrimmage as well.
And so the next event on the
Cardinal calendar is the visit of
the rejuvenated Husky eleven. With
a 13-0 triumph over California to
their credit, and with the Notre
Dame system l'airly well installed,
the Purple and Gold gridmen spell
trouble for Stanford. Saturday's
game promises to be as tough as
any of those yet to come this season.

outfit.
Holding the Cards to a 7-0 score
at half time with a stubborn de
fense, the Bruins looked weak only
on two occasions in the second half
when Rothert rambled to touch
downs from 56 and 38 yards out.
But followers of the Big Red Ma
chine must bear in mind first: that
Stanford had reached a certain
psychological peak a week previous;
second: that the wet field and new
surroundings had much to do with
the play of the men; and third: that
it was a miscellaneous team in the
game at all times.
Comparative Scorcs
Returns from the North indicate
that Oregon State bowed to Wash
ington State by the same margin
the Beavers lost to Stanford. On
the basis of such comparative
scores, it is impossible to arrive at
any conclusion regarding the merits
of the different teams in the Coast
Conference. But one thing is cer
tain, that the University of Wash
ington eleven will afford the War
ner men plenty of opposition on No
vember 11.
Little Bill Laird at left half was
the bright and shining Ift*hl: of the
Cardinal outfit Friday, even putting
the incandesccnts of the Coliseum
to shame. Running the team like a
captain handles his ship, Laird may
prove to be the answer to Stan
ford's prayers for a field general.
Clark Makes Gains
Another not-so-heavy lad who
has been cooling his heels on the
bench for a while, one William
Clark, likewise was given an op
portunity to strut his stuff. Wil
liam bobbed up with the old pass
defense in the fourth quarter, and
turned in some neat gains from
scrimmage as well.
And so the next event on the
Cardinal calendar is the visit of
the rejuvenated Husky eleven. With
a 13-0 triumph over California to
their credit, and with the Notre
Dame system l'airly well installed,
the Purple and Gold gridmen spell
trouble for Stanford. Saturday's
game promises to be as tough as
any of those yet to come this season.
Back from the glare of the Lo:;
Angeles Coliseum, the Stanford
football squad will lose no time to
day in settling down to the serious
business of preparing for the Wash
ington Huskies. A 20-0 victory over
the U.C.L.A. eleven reposes to their
credit on the right side of the ledger,
the fruits of the Southern invasion,
and no injuries mar the debit col
umn.

With the exception of Mar Albert
son, whose knee trouble incurred in
the Southern California game may
keep him on the sidelines, and
Henri Laborde, likewise out with a
bad knee, all of the men should be
in shape for Washington Saturday.
Bruins Improve
Stanford's one and only Southern
invasion of the past week-end pre
sents two possible viewpoints for the
Stadium cynics. Either Stanford,
whose 20-0 win is dwarfed by
U.S.C.'s score of 52-0, is as weak
as she seemed in the Trojan game;
or the Bruins are a much improved
outfit.
