### 
Staid Princeton. alma mater of the late Wood row Wilson and
oilier lovers of peace, blew off a little football steam last week, the
>tudents building bonfires, blocking traffic, and dragging ' "Thr Chris
tian Student" about the campus in an effort to inspire their oft
defeated varsity grid team to perform as did Tiger elevens in the
days of old.
Consecutive defeats by I'rown. Cornell, and the Navy caused it
all. A student council at Princeton decided that the team needed
inspiration. An assembly was called; enthusiasm was plentiful. The
a: senibly at an end. Princeton's student body swept over the campus,
eager to provide the football team with more inspiration. l»onfires
were lighted; Princeton. X.J.. traffic was interfered with.
Then some genius in the crowd remembered "The Christian
Student," heavy copper creation of Daniel Chester French. Here
was inspiration enough for several football teams. The statue was
removed from its pedestal back of the library and dragged to
Nassau street where Dean (lauss rushed to its rescue.
The dean, when he caught up with his charges, managed to tell
them, "Enthusiasm of this sort at football games might bring re
sults in victory." The student body respectfully gave the dean a
rousing cheer. "The Christian Student",was saved.
Stanford annually has a Pig Came rally and a bonlire that is a
bonfire. ()ti many occasions student enthusiasm has been aroused
t«i provide Cardinal athletes with inspiration, but the Daily cannot
remember the time when a Stanford dean had to chase about the
campus in an effort to protect Cnivcrsity property from the plavful
antics of over-zealous students.
