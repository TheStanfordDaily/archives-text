# CHAINS OF TRADITION

Tradition is now the sole excuse offered by a majority of Stan
ford fraternities for continuing barbaric Hell Week programs. It
is unfortunate that the bonds of custom are strong enough to bind
us to this disgraceful practice, even though fraternity men are gen
erally agreed that llell Week should go.
I'erhaps it is too much to expect (Ireek letter organizations to
sever themselves from tradition in one stride. ( )nly recently have
national councils of the several houses interested themselves in
reforming the pre-initiatory period.
It is cheering to learn, though, that Hell Week has been greatly
moderated in many Stanford chapters since last year. Where a full
seven days of idiotic abuse was the average a year ago. three davs
is the common practice now, and in some instances the period has
been cut to 24 hours.
If the present rate of decrease continues, another five vears
should see llell Week relegated to the junk heap of obsolete tra
ditions where it belongs.
