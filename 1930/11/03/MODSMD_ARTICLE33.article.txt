GENETIC STUDIES OF GENII'S,
111. B> Lewis M. Terman. Stan
ford University Press, 1930. $f>.
"The Promise of Youth,'' third
volume of this series, seeks to dis
cover to a further degree how gifted
children develop.
The study was planned fifteen
years ago. It has been six years since
the second volume. Several years
must elapse before the subjects of
the experiment reach maturity.
Consequently the study represents
a middle period in the lives of the
gifted group.
"It is quite possible that no intel
lect of heroic stature will emerge
from the thousand gifted subjects
of the present investigation," the
' report states. "The Oxford Rhodes
i scholars are far more highly se
lected than our gifted group . . .
yet none from the hundreds of them
lias thus far risen to over-towering
eminence. . . .
"The appearance or non-appear
ance of supremely eminent indi
viduals is not, however, in point
here. The point is that there is
abundant work in this day and age
for IQ's of 140 or 150, and that it is
probably at this level that rightly
directed educational endeavor can
be most effective."
These observations are recorded:
! gifted children come from superior
intellectual and stocks;
these stocks have decreased in fe
cundity during the last two genera
tions.
I Health of the experimental group
is slightly superior to the general
run of children. The gifted child is
not as a rule characterized by in
tellectual one-sidedness, or emo
tional instability.
Gifted girls deviate from the femi
i nine normal toward masculinity.

EX-MISTRESS — At the Green
Street Theatre, San Francisco.
Starvation or a big chance is fac
ing the owners of this notorious
playhouse. For they are putting on
a new class of production, and a
different kind of audience will have
to be developed. It is a good pro
duction, too—not a line in it that
is really offensive.
Three of the most charming ac
tresses to be seen north of Mexico
City this year are the Ex-Mistress
herself, Belle Foster, and Greta
| Granstedt and Gudy Swanson, who
l play the other leading female roles.

These girls have these, them, and
those, and they act with the ability
of old-timers. The whole play is
cast with care toi make it humorous.
''No Offense" ought to be the
theatre's new motto, because they
are putting on a real good show,
and ought to forget their old rip
snorting, scandalizing, smoke-house
reputation. —W. H. G.

HER MAN—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
If you like street brawls, and
saloon music, Cuban silks, and sail
ors who make hat-smashing a spe
cialty, you will like "Her Man." (Ai
though He, this time, is quite the
other sort of sailor.)
On the other hand—if you like
Helen Twelvetrees' tip-tilting nose,
and eyes that are looking for some
thing clean and fine—and an Irish
man who can smile—and a picture
practically without a theme song,
the show won't be totally lost.
Ricardo Cortez makes the chil
dren in the audience gasp, in two
or three places. But he isn't bad
enough to horrify us, and not quite
nice enough to arouse sympathy.
And as a demon knifer, he is any
ting but threatening. Again, this
i story is one in which even a sug
gestion of the old "mother love"
plea is decidedly a mistake.
We do recommend the picture,
though, as containing absolutely the
best fight of the century.

BIG MONEY — At the Varsity
Theatre.
Despite the fact that its plot is a
trite mixture of our many recent
gangster pictures, "Big Money" is
an excellent picture. With Eddie
Quillan and Robert Armstrong in
the leading roles, Dorothy Burgess
and Miriam Seegar furnishing the
feminine element, "Big Money"
deals with the gambling activities
of a messenger boy (Eddie Quillan)
in the washroom of the Stock Ex
change.
He rises to be a "big shot" in the
gambling racket, is implicated in the
murder of a fellow gambler, and
finally returns to the straight and
narrow for the love of his former
boss's daughter.
The picture is taken from the
story by Earl Derr Biggers and is
notable for its clever dialogue and
comedy. Don't fail to see it!
—H. D. M.
