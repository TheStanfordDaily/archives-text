And now we have a 20-0 victory
for a week-end record, made under
the bright lights. Yes suh—Nigh;
life seems to be just the thing for
our famous squad of heavyweights
1 (not so heavy, some of 'em, but it
sounds well anyway).
Maybe we could import some
Southern California breezes or
1 moon or whatever it is that's so
inspiring (outside of Hollywood—
that's too expensive) and exist in
i a state of perpetual victory.
i Once, during the fourth quarter
of the game, it looked as though
jwe d gone back to the good old
days of enthusiastically rule-less
football. Everyone laughed and felt
I better, when a Stanford end got so
! excited and anxious for play that
he ran fifty yards down the field
' before the ball was actually

snapped into play. No damage done
—and' he was at least running in
the right direction!
Another startling discovery for
the scientific world! There is a Stan
ford senior (sworn to be a good
dancer, date, drives his own car,
and all the other necessary collegi
ate evils) who didn't know where
Mills College was located, except by
hearsay, until last Friday night. A
normal person, mind you, who has
spent three years on this campus,
is not engaged (at least, not to any
one near enough at hafld to matter)
and still had never been on the
i Mills campus.
J Sounds as though the old order
; were changing—Mills bowing to
; Castilleja or something. At least—
| it couldn't be a Stanford co-ed de
i taining him, could it?
