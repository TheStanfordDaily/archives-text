I Faith is a glorious attribute; and
! there arc many ways of expressing
this splendid quality. Perhaps the
j most unusual is that employed by
the men at Pomona College who
; have decided not to shave until
their varsity scores.
Perhaps some local product, de
siring some publicity and a record
i length beard, wilt pledge himself
not to shave until Stanford beats
the ever-growing city of Troy.
j
Northwestern University believes
1 that college should be stripped of
j its glamor. The only way to stop
1 the public from thinking college is
a romantic holiday is to adopt a
rigid censorship of the press, movies,
and books.
Freshmen lose the romantic con
i cept of higher education after the
first quiz.
A strict idea of old Western
1 equality still seems to exist at the
University of Colorado. A woman
, caught by law students transgress
ing in their lav/ building, was
promptly tried, and sentenced to a
forcible ducking in iho cold waters
of the campus lake.
One might presume that co-eds at
Colorado will not be crying for equal
j rights with men in the very near
1 future.
It seems that there is a moral in
J this story for our own future law
i vers.
All campus chaperones at the
University of lowa have organized
themselves into a Chaperone's Club,
i Just another one of these organiza
' tions that never do anything. Most
I campuses would seem to have too
; many dead-wood clubs.
Chaperones are funny things;
! something like fire-extinguishers
always around but never used.
The administration at the Univer-
I sity of Indiana forbids students to

drive their dates to dances in auto
mobiles. Well, buggies might do just
as well.
Sorority women at U.C.L.A. have
just devised a new schcme to lure
scarce coins from out of the pockets
of local men students.
The plan consists of selling tickcts
to miniature golf courses. Those
•1,000 women down there can ride
those 2,000 men only so far and
then the 2,000 worms will turn—and
what a squirming it will be.

One might presume that co-eds at
Colorado will not be crying for equal
j rights with men in the very near
1 future.
It seems that there is a moral in
J this story for our own future law
i vers.
All campus chaperones at the
University of lowa have organized
themselves into a Chaperone's Club,
i Just another one of these organiza
' tions that never do anything. Most
I campuses would seem to have too
; many dead-wood clubs.
Chaperones are funny things;
! something like fire-extinguishers
always around but never used.
The administration at the Univer-
I sity of Indiana forbids students to

drive their dates to dances in auto
mobiles. Well, buggies might do just
as well.
Sorority women at U.C.L.A. have
just devised a new schcme to lure
scarce coins from out of the pockets
of local men students.
The plan consists of selling tickcts
to miniature golf courses. Those
•1,000 women down there can ride
those 2,000 men only so far and
then the 2,000 worms will turn—and
what a squirming it will be.
I Faith is a glorious attribute; and
! there arc many ways of expressing
this splendid quality. Perhaps the
j most unusual is that employed by
the men at Pomona College who
; have decided not to shave until
their varsity scores.
Perhaps some local product, de
siring some publicity and a record
i length beard, wilt pledge himself
not to shave until Stanford beats
the ever-growing city of Troy.

Northwestern University believes
1 that college should be stripped of
j its glamor. The only way to stop
1 the public from thinking college is
a romantic holiday is to adopt a
rigid censorship of the press, movies,
and books.
Freshmen lose the romantic con
i cept of higher education after the
first quiz.
A strict idea of old Western
1 equality still seems to exist at the
University of Colorado. A woman
, caught by law students transgress
ing in their lav/ building, was
promptly tried, and sentenced to a
forcible ducking in iho cold waters
of the campus lake.
