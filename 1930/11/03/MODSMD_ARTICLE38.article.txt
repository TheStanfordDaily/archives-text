"Come in."
The door of the dressing room
opened and we went in to interview
Dale Winter, who was in the act of
putting on a stunning black hat. She
looked inquiringly at her husband
and smiled as Henry Duffy intro
duced us.
"You won't mind the grease, will
you?" she said, putting out her hand.
"You saw the play?"
She smiled at the very obvious
appreciation of her performance in
"Michael and Mary" which was clos
ing that night at the Alcazar in San
Francisco, and pointed to an abbre
viated pink satin and red tulle cos
tume hanging by the side of the
dressing room, and declared that she
expected many students from the
Farm to enjoy May Bo ley, who
wears the costume as a burlesque
queen in "Stepping Sisters" which
opened Sunday.
"We consider the likes and dislikes
of our college students very much
in choosing plays, and they ought
to like the comedy which opens to
morrow," Duffy added, and then
grinning at Dale excused himself for
a few minutes on the plea of desir
ing a shirt in place of the robe he
was wearing. We took the oppor
tunity to ask Dale about Philip Bar
ry's "Holiday" in which she starred
on the stage.
"It's one of my favorite plays,"
then she smiled and added, "I'd like
to play in it forever. Ann Harding
is a very good friend of mine and I
think she was wonderful on the
screen, but somehow the screen ver
sion seems to lose some of the story's
appeal. It's a marvelous play."
When Dulfy returned he was foot
ball-minded and was greatly inter
ested in the games played under the
lights at night.
