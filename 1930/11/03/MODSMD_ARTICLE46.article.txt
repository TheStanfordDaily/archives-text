FRESIIMEN?
Speaking of football schedules,
cast your eyes over this one:
Sacramento Junior College
Santa Clara Freshmen
U.C.L.A. Freshmen
Saint Mary's Freshmen
Southern California Freshmen
California Freshmen
Take 350 yearlings, the majority
of them unlit for football, and elim
inate the unlikely candidates. Sixty
remain, a handful of which were
good high-school players before
they came to the Farm. Give them
two weeks to learn the Warner sys
tem, admittedly the most compli
cated st,\ le of play to be found in
football circles. And then throw
them into (lie season listed above,
six games on six successive week
ends.
Those who would like to trade
places with James "Rabbit" Brad
: haw will raise their right hands.
What, no candidates? Bradshaw has
maintained a .500 average on that
schedule with one tie, two victories,
and two defeats to his credit. He has
only had a crippled squad to con
tend with, too, or he might have
turned in a better record to date.
Strange as ii seems, that schedule
has been one of the factors in the
making of this year's freshman
team. Starting the season with the
raggedness every Balm team must
conquer, the sheer fight required by
that list of games has transformed
the Cards into as smooth an outfit
as Stanford has ever possessed.
Trailing an admittedly superior
Trojan team by three touchdowns,
one of them a gift, at half time, this
band of boys came back on the field
for the second half Saturday and
played rings around the Trojans in
as pretty an exhibition of nerve as
the denizens of the Farm have ever
had the opportunity to witness.
Pushed all over the field by a
It rone o outfit during the lirst half,
this same Stanford team produced
a winning team in the second half
earlier in the season, and showed
that for the old never-say-die spirit
they were unrivalled. Given an even
chance to wallop the -Bruin bunch,
the Rcdshirts bounced the Bruin
Cubs by a 21-0 score.
Breathers? Where are they in that
schedule? Injuries—and what team
has avoided them?—have taken
their toll. Defeat has even been the
portion of the freshmen. But in
spite of everything, the boys have
done well, and Bradshaw has mold
ed a team which Stanford can well
be proud of. Saturday brings the
final i;amo of the season, the annual
battle with the boys from Berkeley.
But what we started to say was
this—why not have the varsity play
a schedule like that'.' Win or lose —
it would be a schedule worthy of
Warner's steel, a schedule which
would bring out the best in the
men. Look at Notre Dame—look at
the schedules of some Eastern teams
—it can he done.
Real battles are in store for the
fans of the future. The Pacific
Northwest is producing machines
which arc as good as the universi
ties of this state have ever turned
out, and when they win their place
on the schedules of the future, there
will either be a champion distin
guishable, or no one with a claim
to fame.
Washington, Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State, California,
I .C.L.A., Southern California —
there will be opposition of the fu- '
ture. What an array that would be '
—and, win or lose, it would be a
team Stanford could he proud to
claim. How about it?
Why not play football all of the
way through lite football season?
