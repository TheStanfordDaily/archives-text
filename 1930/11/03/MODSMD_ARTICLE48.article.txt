## CURDS' PASSING FEATURES HARD BABE CONIES! Long Run By S.C. Quarter Ruins Redshirt Hopes In Final Period 
### Stewart Crawford 
j A fighting team of Cardinal fresh
i men that refused to admit defeat
! until the final gun had sounded,
i bowed before the powerful offense
: of the young Thundering Herd from
j U.S.C. Saturday afternoon in the
| Stadium, 25 to J4.
Unable to stop the running attack
i which the Trojan babes, with per
-1 feet interference, directed at the
Card forward wall and around the
; ends in wide sweeps, Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's warriors fought every
i inch of* the way and kept hope in
the hearts of 'he Stanford fans
until late in the fourth quarter.
Beautiful Passing
Though unable to gain through
; Ihe Troy line, the passing attack of
Ihe Card yearlings was beautiful to
watch, keeping 'he fans on edge and
! the Trojans worried throughout.
The score at the time was 13 to
14 in favor of the young men from
. Troy, Bradshaw's men having start
j eel hot in the third quarter to push
! over two touchdowns in quick suc
cession. After having turned back
i what looked lilted a sure score
through the recovery of a fumble by
Clark, Trojan half, the Cards booted
from their one-foot line to the 37-
: yard mark.
Griffith Scores For Troy
i Stanford's hopes were rising in
| 'the prospect that the babes could
i hold again, and c nee in possession
of the pigskin could begin another
{effective aerial drive to grab the
I lead. But Griffith, the fleet Trojan,
behind an interference that cut out
ail Card tacklcs, went around left
end and raced the full distance to
blast the last chance of the bruised
but still game yearlings, giving the
Trojans a safe margin of 25 to 14.
U.S.C. scored in the first quarter
when a break for Stanford was
turned into a touchdown for Troy.
Tatum, from the right tackle berth,
charged in to block a U.S.C. punt
from the Card 43-yard line, and
Tarver recovered for the Card babes
on the S.C. 37. Here Clarke inter
cepted Minckler's pass and was un
touched on a 65-yard run to a
score for Troy.
Two more touchdowns followed
for the Trojan babes in the second
quarter, featuring Brouse, half, in
wide sweeps and laterals around
end, the score standing at 18 to 0 at
half time.
Card Passing Functions
Taking the ball a few moments
later on the Troy 35-yard line, the
babe passing attack again began to
function. Maentz to Spencer netted
12 yards, and then followed the
most beautiful play of the after
noon.
Maentz was fading back and back
trying to see a man open to receive
a pass, but none were clear and he
Started a wide sweep around left
end. Nearly to the side lines, he
found himself meeting a mob of Tro
jan ladders. When it looked as
though he were sure to be thrown
for a loss, Maentz let go a beautiful
long pass which fell into the arms
of Spencer, who was just over the
goal line.
