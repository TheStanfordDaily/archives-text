# A 						FLYING DUTCHMAN
## Orv Mohler, Trojan Quarterback, Comes From Athletic Family; His Father Was Old-Time Ball Star 
### Feg Murray, '16 
When the current football season
started, folks out, Los Angeles way
were wondering if Orv Mohler
would make good at the all-import
ant quarterback post with the
U.S.C. Trojans. Coach Howard Jones
likes to have three capable quarter
backs around, to alternate at run
ning the team and doing most of the
ball carrying.
Morley Drury was his most famous
quarterback since coming to U.S.C.,
although "Devil May" Kaer was na
tionally known. Jones already had
a good quarterback in Marshall Duf
field, and Orv Mohler, though
weighing in the 160's, was expected
to be Duffieid's understudy.
But would Orv make good? No
body knew just how good he was,
as he had been injured frequently
as a freshman. In Alhambra High
School, however, he had made a
great reputation, being All-State
quarterback and helping to win a
couple of championships for his
team. But young Mr. Mohler soon
showed tlie stuff he was made of.
You can't keep a good man down,
especially one who comes by his
athletic ability naturally, as Orv
does. He is the 3on of "Kid" Mohler,
famous old-time ball player of San
Francisco and other teams, and in
herits his dad's gray matter as well
as athletic ability.
The Alhambra Assassin scored

twice against Oregon State on Oc
tober 4, his pass to Apsit scored the
Trojans' only touchdown in their
6 to 7 defeat by Washington State
on October 11, and he romped
through and around the Utah Ag
gies for three scores on October .18.
But his big day arrived on October
25 against Pod Warner's Cardinals.
Mohler went in in the second
quarter after Duffield had been
doing sensational work and made
the fans forget all about his blond
predecessor. In two plays he weaved
and dove through dozens of Stan
ford tacklers for thirty yards or
more, and his pass to Arbelbide
scored another touchdown five min
utes later.
Mohler is a cool, nervy, and
brainy quarterback who is hard to
stop without some kind of gain. He
did a little flying during the sum
mer, now he's flying high on one of
the best teams the Trojans ever had.
