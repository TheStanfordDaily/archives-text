Members of the A.W.S. Council
returned to the campus yesterday
after spending the week-end at Fres
no State College where they attend
ed a conference of all four-year uni
versities and colleges in California.
According to Betty Alden, presi
dent of the A.W.S. and official dele
gate to the conference, two measures
were discussed: first, the possibility
of having a course given in student
leadership at the University of Cali
fornia during the summer session:
second, the possibility of having an
expert on vocational guidance visit
colleges throughout the state and
give lectures on tho subject.
It was decided, Alden said, that no
further state conventions be held,
and that an executive committee
composed of a northern, a central,
and a southern institution handle
the interests of their respective geo
graphical groups.
Further conventions will not be
held unless the executive committee,
made up of representatives of the
University of California, Fresno
State College, and Pomona College,
regard a convention as necessary.
Stanford delegates to the confer
ence were: Botty Clarke, Betty Al
den, Sarah Grant, Barbara Beach
Thompson, and Miriam Strout.
