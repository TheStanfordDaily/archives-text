# SOCCER ELEVEN DEFEATS BEARS IN CLOSE GAME
## Fighting Attack Features 3-1 Victory In Initial Tilt Of Series 
### 
After being held scoreless during
the first half and being outplayed
during much of the second half, the
Stanford varsity soccer team
launched a determined fighting at
tack in the final portion of the game
to defeat California 3-1 Saturday
afternoon at Berkeley in the first tilt
of the annual series.
The game was closer and more
uncertain than the score indicates,
for the last Cardinal tally was not
made until the final minute of play,
and up to that moment one kick,
which at times seemed very close,
would have meant a tie score. Stan
ford was on the defensive much of
the time and it was intermittent
flashes of power which brought
home the victory.
L T .C. Scores
ftut when Hirsch, U.C. inside
right, found himself with the ball in
iront of the Stanford goal and pro
ceeded to kick it in, scarcely two
mniutes after the second half began,
it looked like California's ball game.
For a few minutes the Cards seemed
to be slightly rattled, while the
Bears made repeated drives into
Stanford territory.
Moloney's men came back, how
ever, to knot the count at 1 all a
little later when Captain Eberhart
made a pretty rush down the field
with the ball and Falk pushed it
into the net after Youngs, the Bear
goalie, fumbled Eberhart's kick.
Shortly after this tally, Falk found
Youngs a long way out of position
in front of the goal and drove
through him to score without a
single California man being in a
position to so much as make a show
of stopping the ball.
Miller Drives Ball Alone
This gave Stanford a precarious
one-goal lead to which the Cards
clung in the face of constant threats
at their goal until one minute before
the final gun sounded. Miller made
a single-handed run at that time
down the middle of the field and
carried the ball past the goalie all
by himself for a nice kick into the
net to complete the final count of
3-1.
Falk at inside right displayed the
best shooting eye among the Stan
ford forwards and looked good on
the defense as well. Miller, center
forward, played an aggressive game
which gave the California halves
and fullbacks plenty to do

right, found himself with the ball in
iront of the Stanford goal and pro
ceeded to kick it in, scarcely two
mniutes after the second half began,
it looked like California's ball game.
For a few minutes the Cards seemed
to be slightly rattled, while the
Bears made repeated drives into
Stanford territory.
Moloney's men came back, how
ever, to knot the count at 1 all a
little later when Captain Eberhart
made a pretty rush down the field
with the ball and Falk pushed it
into the net after Youngs, the Bear
goalie, fumbled Eberhart's kick.
Shortly after this tally, Falk found
Youngs a long way out of position
in front of the goal and drove
through him to score without a
single California man being in a
position to so much as make a show
of stopping the ball.
Miller Drives Ball Alone
This gave Stanford a precarious
one-goal lead to which the Cards
clung in the face of constant threats
at their goal until one minute before
the final gun sounded. Miller made
a single-handed run at that time
down the middle of the field and
carried the ball past the goalie all
by himself for a nice kick into the
net to complete the final count of
3-1.
Falk at inside right displayed the
best shooting eye among the Stan
ford forwards and looked good on
the defense as well. Miller, center
forward, played an aggressive game
which gave the California halves
and fullbacks plenty to do
After being held scoreless during
the first half and being outplayed
during much of the second half, the
Stanford varsity soccer team
launched a determined fighting at
tack in the final portion of the game
to defeat California 3-1 Saturday
afternoon at Berkeley in the first tilt
of the annual series.
The game was closer and more
uncertain than the score indicates,
for the last Cardinal tally was not
made until the final minute of play,
and up to that moment one kick,
which at times seemed very close,
would have meant a tie score. Stan
ford was on the defensive much of
the time and it was intermittent
flashes of power which brought
home the victory.
