# ENVOY OF CHINESE REPUBLIC HERE TO SEEK SILVER LOAN
## Linebarger To Ask Billion Ounces Bullion For Road Building 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 30 (£>).—
Judge Paul Linebarger, legal advis
er to the Chinese government, ar
rived here today en route to Wash
ington as a special envoy of Presi
dent Chiang Kai-shek, to negotiate
with the American government a
loan of one billion ounces of silver,
worth about $360,000,000.
This loan, Judge Linebarger said,
would be used to rehabilitate the
whole of China by diverting the
millions of men now engaged in war
into peaceful production. He said he
would ask Congress to authorize the
loan on the basis of fifty years at
two per cent interest.
The proposal of China is that ac
tual silver coins, no longer necessary
as a foundation for American cur
rency, be melted into bars and
shipped to the Oriental republic to
be reconverted into money and dealt
out daily by an American commis
sion to the working people of China
in return for labor.
Silver-hungry China, Judge Line
barger said, would first of all utilize
the money by building roads. Then
manufacturing and farming would
share in it. Presently, he said, the
results would begin to return to
America in the form of heavy pur
chases of American goods. China
believes the American government,
not needing its idle, surplus silver,
could well afford to lend it to a
friendly power at two per cent, not
merely as a means of staving off
bolshevism, which the envoy asserts
is inevitable without the loan, but as
a means of creating customers out of
one-fourth the inhabitants of the
earth.
