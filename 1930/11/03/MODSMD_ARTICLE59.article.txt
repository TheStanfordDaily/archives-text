# EXHIBIT OF WORK BY INDIAN ARTISTS OPENS IN GALLERY
## Ceremonial Dances Shown In Pictures Collected By Pedro Lemos 
### 
Opening yesterday, a display of
drawings by Indian artists of the
Southwest in the Stanford Art Gal
lery will remain on exhibition until
November 23.
These drawings collected by Pe
dro Lemos on his recent trip to the
Indian pueblos depict the spectacu
lar and colorful ceremonial dances
given during the different seasons.
Many of the dances are prayer cere
monies for rain and good harvests.
Several of the Indian artists whose
work is included in the showing at
Stanford have become world noted
for their work. Among the artists
exhibiting are Fred Kabote, Ogwi Pi,
Tse-Ye-Mu, Romando Vigil, Thomas
Vigil, Richard Martinez, Ma Pe Wi,
and Tonita Pena, a woman artist
living at the pueblo of Cochita on
the banks of the Rio Grande.
The caciques, or governing priests
of the pueblos, do not approve of the
Indian artists' work and several of
the artists whose drawings are now
exhibited have been penalized for
drawing pictures of the sacred
dances.
A group of work by Indian school
children shows over fifty Indian de
signs done in the Government In
dian schools.
