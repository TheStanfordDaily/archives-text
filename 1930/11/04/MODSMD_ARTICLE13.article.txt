### 
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 3. (/I 3 ) â€”
With a seat in the United States Sen
ate, the election of six congressmen,
and a state ticket at stake, party
leaders tonight estimate that Ne
braskans tomorrow may poll a total
of 425,000 votes.
The gubernatorial contest is be
tween Governor Arthur J. Weaver,
republican, who has campaigned with
Senator Norris, and Charles W.
Bryan, former governor, brother of
the late William Jennings Bryan and
the democratic vice presidential
nominee in 1924. The state issue has
been confined to economy, taxation,
and state banking laws.
Norris Running
The senatorial race holds major
interest with Senator George W.
Norris, republican nominee, seeking
return. The democratic nominee is
Gilbert M. Hitchcock, Omaha pub
lisher, who was a leader in the Sen
ate during the administration of
President Woodrow Wilson.
A third candidate entered this race
by petition, Mrs. Beatrice Fenton
Craig of Lincoln. Party regularity is
the issue in this race with Hitchcock
standing on his Senate record, and
Senator Norris answering his critics
with the statement: "I'd rather be
right than regular."
