# LEVIATHAN CARRIES WOMEN STOWAWAYS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 3. (/P>â€”After
a 91-mile tramp over English high
ways in high-heeled slippers and
sheer siik hose, walking up a gang
plank and stowing away on a home
bound liner looks easy.
Irene Albro, 31, of Pontiac, Mich.,
who said she has a daughter, 16,
was brought to port on the Levia
than today after such an experience.
She arrived without funds or bag
gage, one of two women stowaways
on the vessel.
