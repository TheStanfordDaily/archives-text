## Republican Congress Need Of Hoover, Burke's Talk States 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Pa., Nov. 3. (/!>)-
James Francis Burke tonight ap
pealed to the American electorate
to give President Hoover a Repub
lican Congress and thus leave his
hands free to provide a steadying
influence to a world beset with
political and economic difficulties.
Speaking over a nationwide radio
hookup of the National Broadcast
ing Company, the general counsel of
the Republican National Committee
said the United States was the last
country of importance to feel the
world-wide depression."
He recalled the business survey
conference of the President which
he said had resulted in an agree
mnt between industrial and labor
leaders that had prevented wage
cuts and silenced strike agitators.
Effect of Vote
What we do at the polls tomor
row is bound to have a direct bear
ing upon the welfare of the world
because everyone knows that what
the world needs most tonight is the
restoration of political and economic
stability,'" he said.
"Not since the feverish period
immediately preceding the World
War has the outlook been so omin
ous, and the spirits of unrest, un
certainty, suspicion, and apprehen
sion so widespread.
"The domestic peace and pros
perity of this nation and the early
return of world-wide economic sta
bility are at stake as a result of
tomorrow's ballot.
Dry Law Up
The Eighteenth Amendment will
be passed upon in two of the 162
referenda before voters in 31 states.
While Illinois and Rhode Island ob
tain ths> sentiment on repeal, Massa
chusetts does the same on its state
enforcement act.
Not alone in those states has the
prohibition controversy caused dis
sension. Ticket-topping candidates
in New York and New Jersey de
clared for repeal. The issue has
figured as well in other campaigns,
especially in Ohio, Montana, Penn
sylvania, and Delaware.
Paramount among the questions
to be answered is whether Repub
lican dominance in Congress, which
dates back 12 years, shall continue.
Leaders of that party reiterated
confidence to the last. None the
less, democratic spokesmen stood by
their predictions that they would
gain a majority in the House and
possibly in the Senate.
The entire House of Representa
tives is being elected for the two
year term beginning March 4, 1931.
Of the 435 seats, 2 are now Re
publican, 160 Democratic, and one
farmer-Labor with 14 vacancies.
Nine of the vacant seats were Re
publican and five Democrat. A
House majority is 218. To get con
trol there, the Democrats must gain
58 votes.
