# Warner Working Team For Tough Washington Game
## Bogue, Ehrhorn, Dawson, Heiser Working on Second Team in Stiff Practices to Prepare First Team For Fast Charging Husky Linesmen PERRY TAYLOR RETURNS TO CENTER POSITION 
### 
It the Stanford varsity hits the Washington team Saturday one-half as
hard us it hit the green fence surrounding the practice field last night, ii
will be too bad ior the Huskies. For the Cardinal team composed of Neill
and Doub, ends; Captain Tandy and Grey, tackles; Bardin and Hulen,
guards; Taylor, center; Moffatt and Caglieri, halves, Hillman, quarter; and
Rothert, full; showed more dash and fire last night than they have shown
all season.
Perhaps the return of Perry Taylor, first string center, to the line-up had
something to do with the verve the men showed; perhaps the cool of tlu:
evening kept them moving; but at any rate, the squad showed considerable
activity. With the absence of Mar Albertson weakening the center position,

'"'and with Harry Laborde still watch
-1 ing practice from the sidelines, Stan-
J ford's squad injuries, nevertheless,
; appear to be at the lowest ebb sincc
1 the start of the year.
McLcod Tried at Center
Evidently becoming tired of watcli
-1 ing McLcod break up all of his pel
; plays, Pop Warner last night shifted
the husky discush thrower from
' guard to center. Although his pass
! ing was a trifle spotty, McLeod may
j turn out to be a demon at the new
position. Hi.s defensive work in
! scrimmage has been outstanding all
season.
j During the early part of the prac
; tice session, Coach Cuddeback's
Grays furnished the opposition on
j defense for a team composed of K.
; Albcrtson and Ned Clark, ends;
1 Bogue and Ehrhorn, tackles; Dawson
and Heiser, guards; McLeod, cen
| ter; Baker, quarterback; Simkins,
j fullback; and Caddell and Rintala,
halfbacks. As usual, this backfield
i turned in some neat gains, Rintala
| and Caddel slicing off tackle for sub
! stantial advances.
Teams Reversed
Changing off, Warner put, this saint;
I team on defense later in the evening
beneath the lights. Phil Wilson, Spud
Hardy, Paul Targhetta and Slip Gil
bert composed the attacking team's
j backfield, while the forward wall
was composed of Wittenau and Craig,
i ends; Oliver and Nelson Grey,
tackles; Kile and Dohrmann, guards;
i and Marks, center.
Hardy proved to be the meteor in
! the quartet, flashing hither and there
in spectacular fashion, but the stub
-1 born defense put up by the "second"
! team made substantial gains few and
far between. Pete Heiser turned in
1 some neat tackles for the defense,
while Albertson at end also starred.
Thornhill Works Line
Warner evidently intends to drive
, the men this week in preparation for
the Washington tilt on Saturday,
while Thornhill was much in evi
dence last night, working on the
charge of various linesmen, since the
Husky game shapes up to be one of
j the toughest Stanford has sched
uled this season. With a two touch
down triumph registered at the ex
pense of the Golden Bears, the Pur
ple and Gold banners will sweep
; triumphantly down upon the Farm
Friday.
How well Phelan has drilled his
men in the fundamentals of the Notre
Dame style of attack remains to be:
â€¢ seen, but judging from the past ex
periences of Warner teams with the
hop-skip-and-jump aggregations, the
stadium visitors this week-end will
' see what is officially termed a "com
bat."
