# UNNECESSARY PRECAUTIONS
## 
### 
Some enterprising bankers have discovered that Stanford stu
dents are careless in their financial affairs and one of them in par
ticular plans to recommend that credit coupons be issued instead
of deposit accounts.
I his would mean the distribution of a sheaf of green or vellow or
red backed slips of paper worth Si or $2. This plan, although it
may prove a bit inconvenient to students, is to do away with the
bookkeeping necessary for the present system of cashing checks of
small denominations.
However, though it may be inconvenient, it will protect banks
ami merchants from possible losses on bad checks.
Regardless of the questions of inconvenience and safetv, it still
remains: Do the Stanford students constitute such a risk as to
warrant unnecessary financial precautions?
