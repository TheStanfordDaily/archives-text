BLACK MANHATTAN
By James Weldon Johnson. Alfred
A. Knopf, New York,
Black Manhattan is a history of
the negro in North America but more
especially in New York City. It is
not complete but as the author ex
-1 plains is to serve only as a back
ground for a better understanding of
the achievements, obstacles, and the
future of the colored race in Araer
i ica.
Ike Murphy, jockey; Tom Moli
neaux, first negro pugilist; the great
leaders, Frederick Douglas, Booker
T. Washington, and Marcus Garvey
I are among the prominent characters
mentioned.
Recommendation of James Wei
-1 don Johnson's work is due to his ex
cellent treatment of the negroes' de
i velopment in the theater. lie begins
with the African Company, 1821, and
its presentation of classic plays; de
scribes the "rise of Ira Aldridge, col
ored tragedian; traces the origin of
the minstrels, musical comedies, jazz
and ends with the part played by
i negroes as playwrights and actors in
the sensational dramas of the pres
ent day, namely, Emperor Jones, All
God's Chilian Got Wings, and Green
Pastures. —H.D.M.

These "Further Poems of Emily
Dickinson'' are some that Emily's
sister withheld from publication be
cause of their intimate nature,
j Although Emily has been dead
j nearly half a , century, much of her

!woik lias only recently been avail
able. She wrote:
"After A Hundred Years."
I "Nobody Knows the Place."
'"Agony Enacted There."
"Motionless as Peace." •
But it is only after nearly a hun
, dred years that we everr know"the
place agony enacted." Yet she has
not been left behind. %
In an age that outgrows every
thing in faith or fashion Emily is yet
j to be overtaken.
She is more modern than Mayor
Walker, more American than plumb-
I ing. Few people realize the flatter
