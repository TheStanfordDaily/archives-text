## Frenchman Says Airship Showed Distress 
### 
LONDON. Nov. 3. OT— I The only
man who saw the tragic end of the
dirigible R-101 sat in the witness
chair today and told in halting Eng
lish how the big ship came at him
out of the night, careening at a
crazy angle before she crashed into
the hillside near Beauvais and burst
into the flames which took 48 lives.
Alfred Rabouille had never been
away from Beauvais since his
childhood before they brought him
to London to tell his story. On that
night when the R-101 dived to de
struction he had been poaching for
rabbits in the woods near the Beau
vais hillside.
Feared Penalty
Today he told the board of in
vestigation the loss of the dirigible
that he had fled in a panic when
the ship fell and had kept silent in
fear of the penalty reserved for
poachers.
"But we are not interested in why
you were out that night," Attorney
General Jowett told him.
Then Rabouille told his graphic
story.
Tilted at Angle
The drigible, he said, seemed to
be tilted at a sharp angle and head
ing downward when he first saw
hei\ Her lights flashed on and off
twice. Then the big ship struck the
hillside, there was a loud explosion,
a burst of flame, and Rabouille
found himself on his back in the
underbrush.
"Then she bounced and seemed
to go up in the air," he said. "She
fell and that was the end of her."
