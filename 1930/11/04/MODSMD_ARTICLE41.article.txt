The "Co-op" at California adver
j tises that "Hating Stanford, buying
! at the 'Co-op,' and winning football
| are customs we cultivate."
It would seem that our friends at
| Berkeley love their Palo Alto cous
| ins—that is judging from their foot
| ball results this far.

The editor of the Daily Trojan
refers to that affliction known
as the Stanford attitude.
i One cannot imagine what this
| dreadful affliction is unless it refers
' to the manner in which Stanford
fails to act like the movie-idea of
college. Perhaps the affliction in
cludes amateur athletics, high schol
arship, and lack of a boisterous
! "light on" for alma mammy spirit.
Princeton lias organized a
men's dancing chorus of thirty
two. The director says people
are tired of woman choruses.
Evidently the director has never
studied the beaming individuals in
the first- row of an Earl Carroll
show; evidently the director has not
studied psychology; evidently the
director has not seen many male
choruses.
Women at Claremont College
claim that men are so "dead" they
will organize their own rooting sec
tion with their own yell leaders.
Yes, and why don't they or
ganize their own football team,
their own coaching staff, and
have a nice party all by them
selves. Better yet, they might
kick all the men out of Clare
inont and have the place all for
themselves.
Everything is relative. We think

our section of the city is the best;
our city is the best in the state; our
state is the best in the Union; and j
our nation is the best in the world. |
Relativity is also exemplified
at the University of Oregon
where co-eds are now rejoicing
at being given a twelve o'clock
lockout instead of the previous
eleven-thirty rule.
