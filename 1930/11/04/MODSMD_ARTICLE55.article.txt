# Yearling Gridmen Point For Little Big Game
## BABES HAVE GOOD CHANCE TO DOWN BEARS IN CLASSIC Blue And Gold Frosh Show Improvement With Each Game 
### Stewart Crawford 
Coach Jimmy "Rabbit" Bradshaw
and his babe Redshirts can now
settle down to the serious business
of getting in shape for the Little
Big Game Saturday at Berkeley.
They have more or less been
pointing for this contest for the last
two weeks, but found it a little
difficult to concentrate on the "beat
California" idea because of a little
matter yet to be settled with South -
ern California.
Cards Battered
This score was settled last Satur
day, and though the already bruised
and battered yearlings were de
feated, the game was a hard-fought
battle, in doubt till late in the
fourth period. 'It was the second
defeat of the season suffered by
Bradshaw's men while fighting their
way through a tough schedule, and
the shape they are in now does not
put too bright a countenance on the
Card chances in the Bear freshman
classic.
However, if comparative scores
indicate anything, the Redshirt
babes have about the best chance of
victory that pre-game dope has
given them in some years. Last
season they lost to U.C. by G to 0,
while the year before they entered
the game rated as underdogs and
spilled the Cubs, 7 to 6.
Cubs Improving
The California freshmen got a
poor start this year, and in early
season it looked as though the Little
Big Game would be a cinch for
Bradshaw's team. After being
trounced by both St. Mary's and
Southern California, the Bears came
back two week-ends ago to take the
Bronco babes, 7 to 0: This outfit lost
only 7 to G to the Card youngsters.
From this it would appear that
Coach Roy Riegels' Blue and Gold
freshmen are improving steadily and
might prove a hard nut to crack by
next Saturday.
