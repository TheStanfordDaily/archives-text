# IMPROVEMENTS TO P.A. HARBOR MAY BENEFIT STANFORD
## Opportunity Seen For Use Of Channel As Course For Crew Races 
### 
Efforts of Palo Alto municipal of
ficials to obtain assistance from the
federal government for develop
ment of the local harbor may benefit
Stanford University.
This much was seen in a state
ment which came from the office of
J. F. Byxbee, city engineer, yester
day.
''We are trying to get the federal
government to assist us in dredging
a channel which will connect our
harbor with the bay. We have done
some work on the project already,
but limitation of funds has curtailed
our activities. The channel when
completed will be more than a mile
long, 17 feet deep, and nearly 100
feet wide."
How Stanford would be helped
was seen by City Attorney Norman
E. Malcolm who said that the chan
nel would provide an ideal place for
crew races and kindred activities.
If completed, it would be compar
able to the Oakland estuary which
is used by the University of Cali
fornia crew, he asserted.
Whether or not the project will
obtain federal aid depends on the
location of the new navy dirigible
base, according lo Arthur James of
the Palo Alto City engineering de
partment.
"If the government picks Sunny
vale as the location of the dirigible
base, we are assured of some as
sistance in our harbor development,"
James said. "Another factor is the
development of San Jose's water
front. If San Jose is given help, we
will be also."
James pointed out the fact that at
present the bay is shallow at both
Palo Alto and San Jose, while at
Redwood City a channel makes it
possible for the entry of large ships.
