# TERMAN'S BOOK ON GENIUS RELEASED SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Third in the series, "Genetic
Studies of Genius," is "The Promise
of Youth," a new volume by Pro
fessor Lewis M. Terman, head of the
psychology department at Stanford,
which was published Saturday morn
ing.
The new volume is a follow-up of
the studies recorded in "Physical and
Mental Traits of One Thousand
Gifted Children" and "Early Men
tal Traits of Three Hundred Gen
iuses."
Probably the most striking result
of the study is the conclusion that
girls more often than boys show a
drop in the I.Q. in approaching
adolescence and that gifted children
come from family stocks of su
perior intellectual endowment and of
slightly superior physical endow
ment which have greatly decreased
in fecundity and have already
reached the point where they are
not maintaining themselves.
The series is concerned with a
group of one thousand children be
tween the ages of 3 and 18, selected
mainly in California in 1920 and 1921
on the basis of intellectual superi
ority as shown by the results of in
telligence, personality, and psycho
pathic tests. Since the time of the
selection many of the children in
the group have moved to other parts
of the country, but Professor Ter
man and his aides have kept in con
stant contact with them and their
progress.
Other results show that subject
failures in high school are almost,
never incurred by students in this
group and that the largest part of
them go on to college to graduate
with honors.
