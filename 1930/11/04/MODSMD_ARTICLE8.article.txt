# STATE AWAITS ELECTION RACE OPENING TODAY
## Daylight Saving, 25 Other State Propositions Head Ballot 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3. </F).â€”
The 1930 political campaign in Cali
fornia poised last night- upon the
brink of the well-known zero hour
ready to plunge into history.
Daylight saving' and 25 other state
propositions which head the ballot
threaten to overshadow the handful
of contests between the candidates
for major state and national offices
which will occupy the attention of
California's voters tomorrow.
Interest in Governor
The election of Governor was still
the focal point however. Republicans
turned today to speculating on how
large a majority this republican state
will give James Rolph, Jr., San Fran
cisco's smiling mayor. They predicted
the largest majority ever polled by a
California governor would carry
"Sunny Jim" from under the tower
ing dome of the City Hall to the
State Capital, while State Senator
Frank F. Merriam, of Long Beach,
would be selected lieutenant gov
ernor by a smaller, but still size
able majority.
Uundaunted by the previous pa
rade of victories of republican can
didates for governor, supporters of
Milton K. Young, democratic stand
ard bearer, forecast a 200,000 ma
jority for the Los Angeles cam
paigner. The prediction was founded
on the belief that the absence of
outstanding issues would see only
45 per cent of the state's two and a
quarter million registered voters go
to the polls.
Both Dry and Wet
While Young seeks election as a
dry, the democratic nominee for lieu
tenant governor, Martin I. Welsh of
Sacramento, asks for the votes as a
wet. The campaign was also marked
by Young's hearty disapproval of
Justus Wardell as state chairman for
his party.
No. 7, a proposal which would
hurry up everyone's alarm clock, has
probably attracted the most wide
spread attention of the 26 state prop
ositions with the daylight savers
arguing against the standard timers
from sunrise to sunset.
It has been overshadowed in the
counties of the San Francisco bay
region by the local $35,000,000 bond
issue to bridge Golden Gate.
