# STANFORDITE BREAKS AFTER DARK RULES Man Forced To Keep Walking On U.C. Campus BERKELEY HOSPITALITY STOPS AT SUNSET
## 
### 
California's campus police force
holds immovably to the line of duty,
a Stanford student learned recently
to his intense sorrow.
The student, entirely unaware of
the rigidity of U.C. "after dark"
rules, seated himself at the foot of
the mighty Campanile early one
morning to await some friends who
were to meet him there at 2 o'clock.
After waiting the better part of
an hour and actually coming to feel
a certain affection for the California
campus in the starlight, he was
rudely—yes, rudely—disturbed. One
of the men hired to keep the little
Bears out of harm's way approached,
illuminated the waiter's face with a
flashlight, and stared —rudely. The
person thus placed in the limelight
said, "Hello."
"You can't sit on these benches
after dark. It's agin the rules," the
defender of virtue replied.
Upon being informed by the Stan

fordite that there was apparently
nothing else to sit upon, the man
remained obdurate and though the
unfortunate had but 10 minutes
longer to wait for a ride back to the
Farm, he was mercilessly expelled
under threat of being jailed for va
grancy, arguments not withstanding.
After placing a safe distance be
tween himself and the "law," the
exile expressed himself as to that
one's lineage and heredity, after
which he made his way to Sather
gale and furtively lingered there
hoping that his friends would pass
that way.
When his spirit had reached its
lowest ebb and hope had all but
died, a welcome honk was heard
and a Ford, plastered with Stanford
stickers, rolled up and took him
away from that hide-bound place of
police pestilence—away to the Farm,
where the "winds of freedom blow"
and one, or even two, may sit on
benches after the sun has set.
