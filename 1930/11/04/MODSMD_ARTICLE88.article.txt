# EXCELLENT FRUIT PRODUCED ON U.S. FARM PLOT HERE
## Reports From Station Here Furnished Communities All Over U.S. 
### 
Apricots so heavy that four make
I a pound; peaches the size of canta
lopes; plums the color of black vel
, vet—these are products of the
! United States experimental station,
j reached by crossing the field oppo
j site Sequoia Hall.
Twenty-five hundred fruit trees
' will blossom there in the spring. It
is a good locality for the delicate
work of tree-hybridization, accord
' ing to W. F. Wight, botanist in
I charge of the station. Blooming sea
j son lasts more than a month—un
usually long, even for mild cli
, mates. There are never late frosts
i to kill the buds, nor wind to whip
i the heavy blossoms. Proximity to
I the ocean and bay account partly
1 for the excellent conditions.
Wight is experimenting now to
j produce a peach perfect as to flavor,
; color, and weight, and with the
l added novel feature of a cherry-pit.
i This is to answer the requirements
i of a recently invented spitting ma
chine, whose thin blade snags on
[ the sharp irregularities of the com
mon peach-pit.
Wight inspects and stratifies hun
! dreds of thousands of seeds each
j season from the campus orchard.
I This is the only federal station
where deciduous fruit breeding is
| being done; reports are sent from
| here to fruit-growing communities
! all over the United States.
