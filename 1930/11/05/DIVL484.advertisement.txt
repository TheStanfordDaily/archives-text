At Illinois it's
ALONG Green Street, where
- campus leaders stroll ... in
« the great slate-roofed fraternity
houses of Champaign . . . there is
one pipe tobacco which always rolls
up the biggest vote. At Illinois it's
Edgeworth, every time.
A pipe -Edgeworth. That is the
smoking combination which has
won the college man. Harvard,
Cornell, Michigan, Stanford, Dart
mouth — all agree with Illinois.
Natural merit has made Edgeworth
the favorite tobacco in America's
leading colleges and universities.
College men everywhere respond
to the appeal of pipes- packed with
cool, slow-burning Edgeworth. Be
guided by their verdict: try Edge
worth yourself. Find it at your
nearest, tobacco shop—lsfi the tin.
