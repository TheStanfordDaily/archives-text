■ Metal on trial
In the laboratories of scores of foundries
and rolling mills,a constant search is being
conducted for a metal that is stronger, more
resistant to temperature strains, and more
economical to produce. Almost as constantly
the compounds and alloys so developed
are being brought to Crane Co. tor trial.
The court that passes on them is composed
of the most experienced Crane designers,
metallurgists, and engineers. Under its
direction bars of the new metals are care
fully tested for ductility, reduction of area,
elastic limit, and yield and breaking points.
Hardness, transverse strength, and
torsional strength are measured, behavior
under temperature strains is determined
by"iooo hour creep tests."
When the findings of all tests are favor
able, the metals are made into valves and
fittings for trials in the Crane plant that
will approximate actual working condi
tions. Then Crane Co. sends out these
new materials to certain engineers who are
interested in advancing piping practice.
They use them in actual service; observ
ing them over long periods, sending full
reports to Crane Co.
Not only do materials thus developed serve
all industry. They have contributed to a
vast library of engineering data on metals
and their capabilities. Much of this is em
bodied in a book. "Pioneering in Science",
a valuable reference manual for students.
