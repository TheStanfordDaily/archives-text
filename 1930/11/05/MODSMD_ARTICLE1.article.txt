# Gridmen Play To Scoreless Tie In Practice Session
## Warner to Drill Team on Play and Defense Tactics Against Washington's Style Attack for Remainder of Week's Practices VARSITY IN GOOD CONDITION FOR HUSKIES 
### LEN KULLMANN 
STAGING their (irst game of the season last night during practice ses
sion, the Stanford football squad made up in noise and enthusiasm
what they lacked in finesse. Chattering among themselves, the first and
second strings battled forty minutes to a scoreless tie under the none
too-impartial refereeing of "Dink" Templeton.
Harry Hillman, Harlow Rothert, Guido Caglieri, and Phil MofTat com
prised the first string backfield; the line held Taylor at center, Hulen and
Bardin at guards, Ehrhorn and Bogue at tackles, and Neill and Doub as

ends. Opposing them were Red
Targhetta, Bill Clark, Rudy Rintala,
and Bill Sihkins behin dthe line of
scrimmage; Bill Marks, center; Hei
ser and Dawson, guards; Nelson
Grey and George Grey, tackles; and
Bush and Colvin, ends.
Punting Trouble
Both teams had trouble with their
punts, Ehrhorn crashing through to
lake one of Rintala's boots on the
chest for the glory of the first team,
while Don Colvin ruined Moffatt's
Iry on another occasion.
Templeton turned in the most
spectacular gain of the evening,
pacing off 15 yards through the mid
dle of the first team when he
caught one of the Cards holding.
Rintala and Clark produced the
most substantial gains found near
the extremities of the line, while
Rothert, Hillman, and Simkins hit
the forward wall when called upon.
Players Bruised
Targhetta, Bardin, and Marks,
who were treated a trifle roughly
during the course of the scrimmage,
were replaced respectively by
"Slip" Gilbert, ''Red" Hand, and
Norm McLeod. None of the boys
were badly bruised, and the trio
should be fully recovered by the
lime tonight's practice session rolls
around.
With Ihe exception of Mar Al
bertson, second string center, all of
the men will be in shape for Sat
urday's clash with the Huskies. Al
bcrtson has not been out at practice
all this week, and is definitely out
ol the Washington game, although it
was hoped at first that he would be
able to play.
New Center
McLeod, now ex-guard, appears
to be permanently shifted to center
since he was still at that post dur
ing practice last night. Little Nor
man showecj. well during his short
stay in the scrimmage, although his
work has yet to receive its baptism
by fire during an actual game.
Although both teams were fairly
evenly matched last night, they
marched up and down the field in
line style until the 20-yard line was
reached. Neither offense showed the
punch to put over a tally, being held
for downs whenever they reached
dangerous territory.
Open Practice
In contrast to the week before
the U.S.C. game, when secret prac
tice was ordered and enforced, last
night's game was open to many who
wandered into the field. With the
exception of Stanford's lone night
practice, which was also well at
tended, yesterday's clash saw more
men within the sacred confines of
the practice field than is usual be
fore a major clash.
Warner is not taking the Huskies
lightly, however, for the "game"
found the men making heavy
weather of the evening. Pop will
probably devote the remainder of
the week to a drill on plays and
defense against the Washington style
of attack both to prepare the men
for the game and to save them from
any injuries which might be in
curred in scrimmage.
