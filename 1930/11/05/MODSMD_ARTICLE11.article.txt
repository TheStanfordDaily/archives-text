## Army-Navy Meet Suggested As Charity Benefit 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. (/P).—Pro
; posals for post-season college foot
ball games for the benefit of unem
ployment relief, fast accumulating
, today, have attracted widespread
, support and interest, especially inso
■ far as they involve the possibility of
■ Army and Navy patching up their
, differences to aid the common cause.
; Chicago and New York, as well as
, Philadelphia, are prepared to bid
high for a post-season benefit game
1 between the rival football forces of
i West Point and Annapolis, despite
; the "many difficulties" which Secre
i tary of the Navy Adams said would
have to be overcome.
George F. Getz of Chicago, chair
man of the Illinois Unemployment
Commission, has suggested Soldier
Field as an ideal spot for the Army
i and Navy to meet on the gridiron
again, for the first time since they
broke off in 1927. He ventured the
gate receipts would produce $750,000
for the aid of the unemployed.
The New York Daily News, which
addressed an open letter to President
Hoover on the subject of an Army
i Navy game, called for united support
of metropolitan agencies in bringing
the game to New York. The news
, 1 paper predicted it would draw a
"gate" in excess of $1,000,000 at
| either of the local ball parks.
