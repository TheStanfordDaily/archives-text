# CONFIDENCE RESTORED TO LABOR PARTY
## Ramsay MacDonald Carries Parliament By Slight Edge In Crisis 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 4. (fP). â€”A major
! ity of only 31 votes carried the Ram
; say Mac Donald government safely
i through the first important division
of the current parliamentary session
: late tonight.
This was regarded a crucial test,
for the balloting was on a motion by
the conservative party to amend the
speech in reply to the address from
the throne. The amendment was de
feated by 281 votes to 250.
The speech from the throne, de
livered by King George at the open
ing of Parliament, but voicing the
aims of the Labor party, has been
under bitter attack for two days, the
Conservatives regretting the failure
of the laborites to propose any ade
quate measures to deal with the
crises in the industrial, agricultural
i and commercial fields or to check
the growth of unemployment.
Supporters of the administration
feared earlier in the week that the
Liberal party, which holds the bal
ance of power, and disgruntled left
wing Laborites might combine with
i the Conservatives to bring about a
government defeat, but this danger
was practically removed when the
Liberals decided yesterday to abstain
from voting on the amendment.
As a matter of fact, five Liberals,
i including Sir John Simon, voted
against the government tonight, but
they were almost counterbalanced by
four members of the same party who
stood by the administration.
