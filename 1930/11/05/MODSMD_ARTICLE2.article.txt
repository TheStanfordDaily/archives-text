There will be a rehearsal of the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra toâ€”
night at 7:15 o'clock in the Roble
Gymnasium, according to Daniel P.
Bryant, director. The rehearsal was
postponed from last night because
of rehearsals for the oratorio pre
sentation of Brahm's "Requiem."
The orchestra is working on "Ruy
Bias" by Mendelssohn and Schu
bert's "Marche Militaire"' at present.
It will give these two numbers to
gether with Beethoven's First Sym
phony at a concert to take place
sometime near December 1. Soloists
for this concert have not yet been
announced.
Bryant states that vacancics may
still be filled among the flutes and
cellos and urges that any musicians
in the Palo Alto-Stanford radius
who care to try out for these posts
in the orchestra be present at the
rehearsal tonight.
