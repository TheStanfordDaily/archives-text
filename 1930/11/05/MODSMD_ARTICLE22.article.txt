# MUSIC LECTURE WELL RECEIVED
## Fowles Tells Effect Of Music On Life 
### 
With a clever artistry which, by !
its very unusual character, capti
vated his audience, Edwin Fowles
last night lectured on "Music and j
Life" as the program for the Tues- j
day evening lecture in the Stanford j
Little Theater.
Fowles is a Fellow of the English j
Royal Academy of Music and is now |
on his third lecture tour of the i
United States.
"Music interprets life," he said. "It j
is a practical philosophy. Just as |
as there is a physical, a mental, and j
an emotional side to life, so there are j
these to music. The need of balance
between the three is essential. In ;
life, the deification of the physical |
gives us the prizefighter; of the men- j
tal, the man of figures; of the emo- j
tional, the sentimentalist. So in mu- j
sic, the physical musician is he whose 1
interest lies solely in the keyboard; j
the mental, he who strives only for '
perfection of technique and harmony; |
the emotional, the sentimentalist.
As he spoke, Fowles illustrated his i
thoughts with selections from the J
masterpieces of musical composition, |
far more eloquent, than his words, j
flis beautiful touch and keen appre
ciation of the sentiment underlying
the melodies entranced his audience. 1
Fowles' dry English humor and in- '
timate tone of voice made his lecture !
almost a personal conversation, while j
his uncanny gift of reading the minds j
of his hearers unfailingly brought the i
response he desired.
With a final request for no ap- j
plause, he gave his "individual hand- j
clasp" through the medium of Schu- j
mann's lovely "Farewell."
