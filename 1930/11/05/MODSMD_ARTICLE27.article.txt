# HOOVER FUTURE HINGES ON VOTE RESULTS TODAY
## Rolph Heralded As Next California Governor By Huge Margin HUGE BALLOT COUNTED 
### (By The Associated Press 
In an election weighted with un
certainties, the nation is deciding to
day who shall sit in congress ; a at
the p'aees of authority at 32 state
capitals.
A Democratic swing away from the
great Republican majorities of 1928
is conceded, but its extent is so be
clouded, even in the private reckon
ings of party leaders, that only the
returns themselves can tell the story.
Basing their campaign of attack on
President Hoover's conduct of his ad
ministration in the business crisis,
the Democrats are acknowledged
even by the Republican stalwarts to
have menaced seriously Republican
dominance in the House, and re
duced the Republican margin in the
Senate. As a result, control of Sen
ate or House, or both, hy a Demo
cratic Independent, eolation, was a
possibility.
Liquor Not Issue
Prohibition, unrecognized by either
party as a national issue, has all but
monopolized the stage in many lo
calities and any overturns will be
scrutinized with extreme interest by
wets and drys.
Not only are the possible fortunes
of President Hoover in 1932 thus
entangled with today's verdict at the
polls, but the result is fraught with
potentialities for other outstanding
figures in American politics.
Among other things, the election
will decide whether Franklin D.
Roosevelt, groomed by his support
ers for the presidency, will be re
elected governor of New York or
voted out of public life.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4. (/P;. ~
California elected a governor and
other state, federal and loc;il officials
today and passed on numerous im
portant referendum measures, in
cluding several bond issues in a bien
nial election.
i Barring an unprecedented upset,
Mayor James Rolph, Jr., San Fran
cisco Republican, was expected to bo
the choice for governor of some hun
i dreds of thousands of voters who
registered their preferences. The ex
i tent of his majority over Milton K.
Young, Democrat, seemed to be the
only element of uncertainty in the
gubernatorial race. The same, to a
; slightly less degree, was expected to
result from the race between Frank
F. Merriam, Republican candidate
for Lieutenant Governor and Martin
I. Welsh, Democratic aspirant.
