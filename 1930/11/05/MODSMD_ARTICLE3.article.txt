PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 4. (/Pi
—They were scalping the scalp
ers on the University of
Pennsylvania campus today,
and how!
The boys who hoist the rates
found themselves unable to
purchase good seats for Satur
day's Notre Dame-Penn game
at almost any price.
Scalpers were said to be can
vassing the campus, but the
students let it be known that'
they would much rather see
the game. Offers of $50 for
seats that originally cost $3
were refused.
Probably in the entire his
tory of the sport in this sec
tion no game has compelled a
ticket-buying interest equal to
this game.
