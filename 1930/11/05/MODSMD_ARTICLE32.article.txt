"Scarface Al" Capone, America's leading gangster and gunman
whom (,'hicago claims as its own. may be feared by the underworld,
but be holds no terrors for Judge John I'. McGoorty. " There must
be no compromise with lawlessness." said Judge McGoorty in reply
to Capone's offer to make a few concessions to the law provided law
enforcers reciprocated with a lew for him.
Capone agreed I 1 ) to quit his labor racketeering, (2) to sur
render on a vagrancy warrant, and (3 ) to leave Chicago and operate
by more or less remote control from Florida. Uut in return Scarface
Al demanded (1 ) no interference with "his beer business and (2)
dismissal of vagrancy charges as soon as he surrenders.
Judge MeGoortv's answer was to tell the Chicago grand jury:
"llis (Capone's) most formidable competitors have been ruthlessly
exterminated, and bi> only obstacle toward undisputed sway is the
law. Such a trade is unthinkable. There must be no compromise
with lawlessness."
It was encouraging to learn, in this day of police corruption ex
poses. of Judge MeGoortv's unqualified reply to the Cook county
crime leader's effrontery. I Iappilv, the time has not yet come when
criminals are allowed to openly bargain with police and judicial offi
cials for permission to break the law.
