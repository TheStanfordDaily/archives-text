Mil. POTTERM ACK'S OVERSIGHT.
By R. Austin Freeman. Dodd,
Mead & Co. l<m At the Palo
Alto Book Shop. $2.00.
Mr. Pottermack commits a justi
fiable murder. But, being an escaped
convict, through a miscarriage of
justice of course, he is unable to
disclose the pardonable nature of his
act without revealing his own
whereabouts.
He takes every caution to avoid
detection. No incriminating detail is
| too trivial, no possibility of dis
covery too remote Cor removal.
With infinite care and amazing in
genuity, MY. Pottermack covers his
I tracks completely, almost com
pletely.
He forgets that a round rubber
i heel revolves as its wearer pro
ceeds.
In the meantime, Dr. Thorndyke,
renowned medico-legal sleuth, en-,
ters the cast' 1 . With his most un
usual capacity for accurate observa
tion and his truly fine powers for
, deductive reasoning he uncovers
the mystery and generously .sets cir
i eumstance aright.

Til!'] SHORT STORIES <>I SAKI.
By 11. 11. Munro. Viking Press,
IJKIO. (At the Palo Alto Rook
Shop.)
There could be no greater com
pliment to modern minded readers
| than that of being presented with
Saki's short stories. The complete
collection includes a versatility of
material, sprinkled at all times with
satisfying satire on people and con
i ventions.
The swift movement of subtlety
prohibits the turning of an extra
page, the skipping of ;> paragraph.
No extraneous comments, descrip
i tions, nor wards are present. The
; reader must be aware of the things
happening in the world, the chang
ing of conventions, to appreciate and

' fully understand Saki.
In the collection are some dis
courses, conducted by "Reginald,"
an<4 some stories. The latter type
are treated ruthlessly. No feelings
are spared. Saki's love of good prac
tical jokes united with his satire,
leave the reader amused, but above
all, admiring a man who wrote
what he wanted to write, regardless
of prevailing literary trends, schools,
and styles.
The most interesting feature of the
edition of Saki's stories is his auto
biography by his sister, which gives
short incidents significant in his
life, from his boyhood to his death
in the war. —J. N.
STEPPING SISTERS—With May
Boley. At the Alcazar Theatre,
San Francisco.
Just a hearty farce, as broad as
its Reading lady, is "Stepping Sis
ters," a Henry Duffy comedy which
opened this week at the Alcazar
theatre in San Francisco.
In not one of the acts through
which step the three sisters — May
Boley, Kathryn Giveny, and Fran
ces Woodbury—is there a single
sophisticated line, but not in the
least does this deter the audience
in its enjoyment of absurd situa
tions with which the plot is filled.
Miss Boley easily takes first hon
ors for her portrayal of Rosie
O'Toole, one of three former bur
lesque show girls who meet in
"Stepping Sisters" after a long
period of years. Kathryn Givney and
Miss Woodbury also win much ap
plause.
As Jack Carlton, a musical com
edy star, Irving Fisher is a leading
man who frequently bursts into
songs of his own composition, at
least one of which is very pleasing.
Lucille Lawson makes an unimport
ant character seem very much alive.
Others in the cast whose work
deserves mention are Robert Adams,
William Lloyd, and Barbara Luddy.

STEPPING SISTERS—With May
Boley. At the Alcazar Theatre,
San Francisco.
Just a hearty farce, as broad as
its Reading lady, is "Stepping Sis
ters," a Henry Duffy comedy which
opened this week at the Alcazar
theatre in San Francisco.
In not one of the acts through
which step the three sisters — May
Boley, Kathryn Giveny, and Fran
ces Woodbury—is there a single
sophisticated line, but not in the
least does this deter the audience
in its enjoyment of absurd situa
tions with which the plot is filled.
Miss Boley easily takes first hon
ors for her portrayal of Rosie
O'Toole, one of three former bur
lesque show girls who meet in
"Stepping Sisters" after a long
period of years. Kathryn Givney and
Miss Woodbury also win much ap
plause.
As Jack Carlton, a musical com
edy star, Irving Fisher is a leading
man who frequently bursts into
songs of his own composition, at
least one of which is very pleasing.
Lucille Lawson makes an unimport
ant character seem very much alive.
Others in the cast whose work
deserves mention are Robert Adams,
William Lloyd, and Barbara Luddy.
