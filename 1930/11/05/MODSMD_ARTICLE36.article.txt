Herbert Dana, the acrobatic foot
; ball referee who has officiated at
most of the Stanford games, and
\ who generally winds up the play
by diving over tackier and ball
carrier to find the pigskin, has ap
j parently set the style for campus
touch football referees. No one was
injured last Monday as the D.U.s
! beat Los Arcos â€”that is, no one but
, the referee, who slid six feet on his
! ear in a wild attempt to find the
ball after a D.U. ball carrier had
! been viciously tagged around the
. ankles.
i
! To the next guy that asks us, with
a smirk, 'What was wrong against
1 U.S.C.?" wc shall give the'explana
tion offered by one of Stanford's
, first string linemen, to-wit "The
i coach told me to let the first man in
I he Trojan interference go by but
, to crack the second man. I was all
j set to carry out orders, but the
ornery first man went and spoiled it
j all by knocking me down instead of
| going past."
The question is, would that sys

tern have been effective even had
il worked? The coach's orders ap
parently didn't take into considera
tion the third and fourth men in
the interference, to say nothing of
the ball-carrier.
For the most complete puncturing
of professorial self-esteem we offer
this:
A certain professor who is of
lather delicate build was lecturing
on cause and effect. "If," he said, "I
hit a punching bag, it moves. That
is the cause of its moving, which
is the effect. If 1 didn't hit it, it
would not move."
From the back of the room came
a verbal thunderbolt.
"G'wan! It wouldn't move if you
did hit it!"
