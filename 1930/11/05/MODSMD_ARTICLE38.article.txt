A survey conducted at the Uni
versity of Michigan revealed that
co-eds enjoy swimming more than
dancing.
That is splendid. Now we can turn
all our ballrooms into swimming
tanks. One advantage to a swim
ming party from the fellows' stand
point is that it would take the date
less time to decide what not to
wear.
The University of lowa has,a class
in radio announcing.
Nov/ if Graham McNamee had
taken such a course he would not
say, "The sun is shining down here
in Los Angeles." Rather he would
proclaim, "Atoms are breaking uo
93,000,000 miles from here and the
resultant energy in the form of light
waves is striking our retinas, thus
stimulating our optic nerves, and
we perceive light."
Now who denies the value of col
lege education?
At Brigham Young University a
lemon is passed to the fellow losing
the co-ed at a "tap" dance.
An excellent idea—a fair ex
change between the receiver of the
lemon and the receiver of the fair
young thing.
The lot of the football men is be
coming harder and harder. If he
accepts a salary, he is branded as
"professional." Now at Oglethorpe
College a varsity man who attempt
ed to be self-supporting by making
and selling wine in the men's dor
mitory, is expelled.
At, the University of Nebraska one
is not permitted 1o smoke during or
between dances. At. the University
of Indiana one cannot "sit out.
dances" in one's car. If this keeps
up, soon one will not be able to
dance at a dance.
Or worse yet, dancing will soon
be the only diversion at a dance.
