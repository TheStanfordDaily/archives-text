# ALLEN PRAISES BRAHM REQUIEM
## Oratorio To Be Given On Armistice Day 
### 
"Brahm's 'Requiem' is a master
! piece in the world's musical litera
ture because it expresses the epi-
I tome of manly grief and is entirely
devoid of sentimentality," said War
ren D. Allen, University organist, in
a lecture on the Requiem given in
the organ gallery of the Memorial
i Church yesterday afternoon.
"Of all the oratorios I have di
rested in my eleven years at Stan
-1 ford," Allen said, . "no score can
give the same thrill. The oratorio
i conductor is accustomed to the
! massive, majestic type of music con
j tained in Handel's "Messiah" or in
! "Samson" where the organ pre
dominates. In this requiem, how
i ever, the organ, when it does ap
pear, seems almost an intruder.
I Brahms was essentially a lyric com
i poser and the human voice and
1 symphony orchestra are his best
, mediums of expression.
j "The requiem was inspired by the
death of the composer's mother in
1865 and was originally written in
! three movements only. It was first
I called a "German Requiem" because
! of the use of the German language
in the text and the German-Pro
l testant spirit expressed in it."
It will be presented by the Stan
ford oratorio chorus as an Armistice
Day program in the Memorial
Church November 11 at 8 o'clock.
