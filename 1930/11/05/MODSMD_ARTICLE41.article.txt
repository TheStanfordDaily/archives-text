## SHIFT! 
### 
A smiling Irishman, coaching his
first year in the rainy Northwest,
wrings a band of Huskies to the
r arm Saturday (news item). With
smite liockne and St. Vitus as his
nitrons, Jimmie Phelan will attempt
0 do what Bagshaw could not ac
complish in recent years —beat Stan
ord.
For the past three years, the
k\'ashingtonians have either seen or
1 ear (I the Huskies kick the Cards
thout football fields for fully three
quarters of the game, only to find
iliat Stanford had scored more
joints than the Purple and Gold
mtfit. In fact, the Warnermen have
»een so lucky to win that the public
s wondering if Stanford won't out
ilay Washington and lose for a
-hange.
But on casting an eye over Stan
ord's not unblemished record dur
ng the Warner regime, the casual
mlooker is surprised tg find a
;lliking correlation in the losses
jrinted in red ink. In fact, those
< sses loom larger because of their
•omparative infrequency.
Beginning with Notre Dante, we
:ee Saint Mary's, Santa Clara, and
•Southern California predominated
ifter the scars branded on the
ardinal record. All of these ball
Inlis employ the hop-skip-and
innp style of offense, to make mat
ers worse, so the situation is worthy
if more than a passing glance.
Gazing at the tide of football fray
mm a Stadium seat lor some three
md three-quarters seasons, your
nimble scribe has failed to notice
my great magic worked by the war
hi nee devotees, although Price of
Jalifornia must believe there is
omething to the ritual or else he
vouldn't have adopted it too.
In fact, from what has been seen,
ve are frank to say not the shift
•at the men who shifted accounted
or the victories, although that glin
ting ogre labelled "Breaks" may
lave had something to do with final
cores, too. Whether stationary or
hifling, an outfit possessing the
'our Horsemen; or Dufficld, Pinck
rt, IVlusick, et al; or Frankian, Bet
encourt, Tobin, and others will win
onie engagements.
All of the dancing in the world
annot change a football team into
Hock of Galloping Ghosts, and we
ise Id remark that Jumping Jo Sa
•oldi is no more effective because
ie *is here one moment and there
he next before the ball is snapped.
Unquestionably the shift, when
iist introduced, gave the moving
earn an immense advantage. But
ince the rules forbid a backfield
10m being in motion, it was the
latural corollary that the rules
hould forbid a line from being in
uition. And so if a team stops for
lie full second, what advantage is
a i tied 7
If a team does not stop, however,
fie added impetus which the shift
ive is often sufficient to ride an
pposing team completely out of
he play. The offensive team has a
tarting signal to charge on—that in
self is considerable advantage—so
ie Rules Committee has seen fit to
gislate the shift to a "full second
top."
On Saturday Warner and the
liift tangle again, if Washington
hould win, the critic will hail it as
nothcr triumph for the patrons of
t. Vitus. But the part played by
iohnes, Hufford, Westerweller, and
few others will have been more
nportant than the shift. Why cheer
le shift then? Shusssh . . . we'll
•!! you. See this column? What
lied it? And that is the secret of
lift publicity? —L. K., Jr.
