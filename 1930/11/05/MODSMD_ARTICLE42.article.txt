# Card Babes Outweighed By Bear Cubs In Line
## U.C. FRESHMEN IN GOOD POSITION TO UPSET BEDSITS Blue And Gold Frosh Right Mentally After Two Grid Victories 
### Stewart Crawford 
Fans can look for most anything
to happen when Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's yearling Redshirts tan
gle with an erratic Bear Cub eleven
at Berkeley Saturday in the tradi
tional Little Big Game.
Though the Card babe chances
appear good, judging from the rec
ord of the two teams so far this
season,. Bradshaw is not overlook
ing two factors which may prove a
decided advantage to the Blue and
Gold freshmen.
The yearling mentor realizes that
California should have the right
mental attitude for the Card en
counter, having won their last two
ball, games after a poor early season
start. They have taken both Santa
Clara and the Oneonta Military
Academy in succession, and seem
In have struck their stride. Much
like their big brother varsity squad,
the Bear Cubs are a team with po
tential power, and if ihey are "hit
ting the ball" Saturday, they may
prove an unexpectedly tough as
signment.
It is a question how much brawn
has to do with the effectiveness of
a forward wall, but, nevertheless a
rival coach will seldom fail to make
weight comparisons of his own line
against that of the opponent.
In checking up on this factor,
Bradshaw has found that his men
will be up against plenty of beef.
The Bear Cub line outweighs bis
wariors by about 12 pounds to the
man, averaging 190 to 178 for the
Card forward wall. Incidentally, the
Californians average over six feet
one inch in height, to just a bit
over five eleven for the Redshirts.
Comparative scores, also a ques
tionable manner of determining the
pre-game dope, would indicate,
however, that this aggregation of
mountain men has nothing on the
Farm youngsters. The U.S.C. year
lings seemed not to be much wor
ried by it, smothering the Cubs by
the decisive count of 27 to 0. Last
week Bradshaw's outfit of compara
tive lightweights threw a scare into
the Trojan babes, and through
plenty of fight and never say die
spirit, nearly overcame them in the
second half.
Bradshaw has few ex-prep school
stars on his eleven, most of his men
having had not too much previous
experience. Determination, and fight
has carried them a long way
through their arduous schedule, and
if they can carry it to a climax in
the Little Big Game, the Bear Cubs
will be in for a strenuous afternoon.
