## FRESHMAN DIVERS GOOD RAW MATERIAL IN SPITE OF INEXPERIENCE, SAYS SMITH 
### Feg Murray, '16 
"We are faced with the problem
of a lack of experienced freshman
diving material, as usual," Ted
Smith, assistant swimming coach,
declared yesterday.
According to Smith there are four
freshman divers working out daily.
They are Rupe Hauser, Fred Shid
ler, Buck Bailey, and Harry Ken
dall.
These men in the short period
since October 1, under Coach Ernie
Brandsten's tutelage, have mastered
' the fundamentals of diving and per
fected six of the 11 dives they must
know for competition.
"While the men are not experi
1 enced they are all good raw ma
terial for diving, as they have ex
cellent builds for the sport," Smith
said;
The coach went on to say, "A*t

present it looks as though we will
be very well equipped for the fresh
man meet with California in March.
Only two of the freshman divers
working out will be entered in the
meet and stiff competition should
develop the successful two a great
deal before then."
Smith justified this statement by
citing the development here of such
Olympic champions as Clarence
Pinkston, A1 White, Dave Fall, and
Ed Throndson, national intercolle
giate diving champion. All these
men were developed entirely at
Stanford by Coach Ernie Brandsten.
According to Smith the present
aspiring divers have a double ad
vantage over those of the past in
the complete new diving equipment
and the opportunity of working out
daily with Pete Desjardins and Ed
Throndson.
