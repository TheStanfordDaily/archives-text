# GRAY GRIDDERS TO MEET BEAR GOOFS AT U.C. STADIUM
## 
### 
California's Goofs are looming up
. on the horizon of the Gray football
men and the Card reserves are get
ting down to work in preparation
! for their tilt with the Blue and Gold
, squad in Berkeley November 15.
This is the only game on the Gray
schedule, so the men are glad to
i have some competition ahead of
i them. Last year they crushed the
Goofs in a walkaway contest and
hope to repeat this season.
Coach Murray Cuddeback predicts
i a win for his eleven, but declares
that the 1930 team is not the equal
i of last year's. The backfield has lots
i of ability, according to Cuddeback,
1 but the line material is considerably
| below the 1929 standard. However,
the California boys have looked
I rather weak in their scrimmages
j with the Bear varsity which is a
hopeful sign for the Cardinal squad.
No extra preparations will be
made for the coming game, Cudde
back says, as the team has been
! working pretty hard all season, but
the interest of the men is expected
to be considerably intensified.
