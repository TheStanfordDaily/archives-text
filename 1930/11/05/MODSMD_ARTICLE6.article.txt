# SOPHOMORES TO PAY FOR RAID DAMAGE
## All Future Jolly-Up Dates Must Be Approved By Ex Committee 
### 
Assessment of the sophomore class
for the amount of damages incurred
during the raid on Encina Hall on
the night of October 6, was ordered
by the Executive Committee of the
A.S.S.U. at the regular weekly
meeting of that body last night.
The action was taken by the com
mittee partly as a punitive measure
and partly as a means of prevent
ing similar raids in the future. The
damages, amounting to approxi
mately $20, arose through medical
treatment of three freshmen hurt in
the struggle.
It was argued that the sophomores
were responsible for the battle in
spite of the fact that it took place
outside of the dormitory, and that
they should be held responsible for
all expenses accordingly.
Jolly-Ups Changed
A resolution was passed ordain
ing that jolly-up dates should be
submitted to the Executive Com
mittee for approval in the same
manner as all other campus social
activities.
In the past jolly-ups have been
held without any official A.S.S.U.
sanction, but the committee desired
that this practice should not be con
tinued in the future.
An A.S.S.U. committee was ap
pointed to carry on the work of the
Social Relations Committee of last
year. This body, which is to be
called the Committee on Interna
tional Friendship, consists of the
following students:
Committee Chosen
Hui Wen Chang, Hobart Young,
Kazuo Kawaii, James Y. Takesake,
Walter Radius, Miriam Strout, Wil
liam Grace, Benjamin Culver, Cbih-
Chang Liang, Catherine R. Guerard,
Catherine Spaulding, Ko Wong
Hung, Yuji Imai, Henry Chao Liu,
and Feng Yang Chang.
Its function is to formulate and
carry out plans for the promotion
of friendly relations between the
foreign and American students on
the campus.
The results of the associated stu
dent election yesterday were ap
proved, as were the minutes of the
Publications Council meeting, which
went on record as opposing the pro
posal to peiTnit advertising or folder
separators.
