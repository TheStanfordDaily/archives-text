# SOCCER SQUAD TO MEET PALO ALTO AMERICAN LEGION
## 
### 
With Coach Harry Maloney tem
porarily out of action, the varsity
soccer squad is getting a rest this
week, no practices having been list
ed for Monday, yesterday, or today.
The hard-fought victory which the
Cards won over California Saturday
entitles the men to some rest, and
heavy workouts are unnecessary,
since a practice game with the Palo
Alto American Legion is the only
event scheduled for the coming
week-end.
Made up largely of former Stan
ford players, the Legion team has
shown considerable strength in
splitting two games with the power
ful Pescadero eleven, but is handi
capped by lack of opportunities for
practice. Ward Smith, coach of the
Cardinal freshmen, is one of the
outstanding men on the Legion
team.
Next Wednesday Maloney's men
v/ill take on San Mateo in a return
engagement which will probably
determine the championship of the
California soccer conference. San
Mateo is in the lead at present with
the Cards in second place, one game
behind. A victory for Stanford
would make -a tie probable.
