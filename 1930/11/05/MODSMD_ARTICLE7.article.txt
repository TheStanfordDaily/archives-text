"If students will only take the
simple precaution of removing the
keys from the locks of their cars,
this small epidemic of automobile
stealing on the campus will stop
immediately," Fred Frche, campus
officer, said last night.
Of the five cars stolen in a week,
keys had been left in all of them,
according to Frehe.
"It takes time for a thief to start
a locked car, and suspicious actions
would attract immediate attention.
Several weeks ago we captured two
charges of the juvenile court at
tempting to start a campus car in
which to escape," he said.
"On the other hand, if someone
gets into an unlocked machine and
drives off as if it were his, an of
ficer standing beside the car could
not be expected to know the dif
ference.
"Of the automobiles stolen from
the campus recently, all but two
have been recovered. Most of them
have apparently been used merely
for joy rides, no damage to the cars
being apparent," Frehe stated.
The machines still missing are
those of Herbert A. Crocker and
S. L. Rawlings.
