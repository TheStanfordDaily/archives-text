# Rooters' Tickets Will Be Checked At Husky Contest
## Complaints of Disorderly Conduct Cause of Drastic Move; Both Student Body Cards and Rooters' Tickets To Be Shown at Games STUDENT VIOLATORS WILL SUFFER BLACKLIST 
### 
A SYSTEM for checking Stanford rooting section tickets, to prevent
people who are not registered in the University from entering the
section will go into effect at the Washington game here Saturday, accord
ing to Ken Mcßae, chairman of the Rally Committee.
"Full details of the system have not been perfected as yet by the
Board of Athletic , Control, which is working in conjunction with the

Rally Comittee," said Mcßae.
The system will necessitate pre
sentation of student body cards and
looters' tickets at the Washington
game and probably at the California
game.
Disorderly Conduct Alleged
Complaints by spectators seated
near that both drunkenness and
disorderly conduct were not un
usual in the rooting section have
led to the drastic change planned
by the Rally Committee.
"No system of checking has been
found practical heretofore," the
chairman .said, "but the Stanford
plan is expected, to be as feasible
as that in operation at California."
Rooters at California are required
to sign for their tickets when they
receive them and also if requested
to countersign at the gates enter
ing the Stadium.
Violators To Be Blacklisted
Penalties foi N transferring rooters'
tickets, according to Jake Irwin,
manager of the ticket department
of the 8.A.C., will include black
listing the offender for future pur
chase of tickets for all athletic con
tests and possible revocation of
tickets for this quarter.
Within recent years the only at
tempt to check rooters' tickets was
at the Tournament of Roses con
test in Pasadena, where students
were required to sign their names,
campus addresses, and the subjects
in which they were majoring. Mc-
Rae stated that because of the ne
cessity of filling the rooting section
rapidly this plan would not prove
successful.
Action taken by the B.A.C. and*
Rally Committee was the result of
a resolution passed by the Rally
Committee at its last meeting au
thorizing Mcßae, A 1 Miller, and
Ernie Hatch to investigate existing
conditions in the rooting section and
devise a practical plan to eradicate
present evils.
