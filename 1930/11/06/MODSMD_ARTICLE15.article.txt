# F.D. ROOSEVELT RE-ELECTED N.Y. STATE EXECUTIVE
## Large Plurality Aided By Stand On Water Power And Prohibition 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 5. (/P).â€”New
York Democracy had a new happy
wairior today, and the state had a
governor re-elected to office by the
largest plurality it ever gave an ex
ecutive.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who called
his friend and predecessor, Alfred
E. Smith "The Happy Warrior" in
nominating him for president, war
ranted that title himself as he sur
veyed radiantly the 725,000-vote
margin by which he was returned
yesterday to the governorship.
Until yesterday the largest plu
rality for a candidate for governor
was the 385,000 by which Smith beat
Nathan L. Miller in 11)22.
Tuttle Far Behind
Nor was it the fault alone of Dem
ocratic strength in New York City,
which usually piles up totals for the
party's candidates. To his state wa
ter power program and, in a lesser
degree, his stand against prohibition,
Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt at
tributed today the magnitude of the
reflection victory he won yesterday.
Latest returns gave him a lead of
723,092 over Charles H. Tuttle, his
Republican opponent.
Out of 8,397 election districts 8,201
had been heard from. Roosevelt had
1,749,717 votes, and Tuttle 1,026,625.
The governor met newspapermen
at his town house in East 65tli Street
just before he left for Albany. He
was smiling broadly, but had little
to say.
Speech to Talkies
"To my water power program, of
course," he replied when he was
asked to what he attributed his big
lead. The governor has favored state
development of water power sites in
up-state New York.
"How about your stand on prohi
bition?" one of the newspapermen
asked.
"Oh, in part of course," he an
swered. There were other things,
too."
For the talking pictures the gov
ernor made a little speech before he
left for the train.
"I jusl want to thank the people of
the state," he said, "For the magnifi
cent vote of confidence they gave
me. That vote, it appears, came not
only from the metropolis and the
cities, but from the villages and the
farms as well."
