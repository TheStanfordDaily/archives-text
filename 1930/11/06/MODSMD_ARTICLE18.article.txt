# PROHIBITION MAJORITY IN SENATE AND HOUSE REDUCED BY ELECTION
## 
### (By The Associated Press 
Tuesday's election produced ac- j
cretions to the senate wet group from !
Ohio, Massachusetts, Illinois and
Rhode Island, and at least one dry
gain—from lowa.
Many prominent drys were re
turned to the senate too, and the big j
arid majority in that body is ex- ;
pected to be continued.
The preponderant prohibition ma
jority in the House also was cut. But
while the association against the pro
hibition amendment was claiming
big net gains in both houses the
Anti-Saloon League pointed out thai
the wets still were far below the!
neeessary two-thirds majority need- |
ed to submit a repeal amendment to 1
the states.
The anli-prohibitionists recorded
overwhelming victories in the repeal
referenda in Illinois, Rhode Island, j
and Massachusetts and provided fur- j
ther ammunition for a wet-dry bat- |
tie which the prohibitionist Borah
has forecast in the early future.
A resolution to repeal the 18th \
Amendment introduced last session I
by Senator Blaine, Republican, Wis- j
consin, is pending before the Senate !
Judiciary Committee. Whether there 1
is any chance of this being debated 1
in the short session starting next j
month remains to be seen. Senator !
Norris of Nebraska, who was re- |

elected, heads the judiciary group.
He is an advocate of prohibition.
Although the prohibition question
was unrecognized by either major
party as a national issue in Tuesday's,
election, the controversy monopo
lized the stage in many states.
Wets and drys divided up about i
equally the senate seats in yester
day's election where prohibition was
an issue, while the anti-prohibition
ists cut into the preponderantly dry
majority in the house.
Three states holding wet referenda,
Illinois, Rhode Island and Massachu
setts—went overwhelmingly for re
peal.
The anti-prohibition forces made
one of their biggest raids in Ohio, .
birthplace of the Anti-Saloon League,
Robert J. Bulk ley, Cleveland Demo
crat. advocate of repeal of the 18th
Amendment, won over Senator Mc-
Culloch, Republican prohibitionist.
He will be the first dry law opponent
Ohio has sent to the senate in eight
years.
In other senatorial contests where
prohibition figured, the antis put
over James Hamilton Lewis in Illi
nois against the "personally dry"
Ruth Hanna McCormick and appar
ently sent Marcus A. Coolidge, Dem
ocrat, to victory in Massachusetts
against William M. Butler, Repub
lican supporter of prohibition.

Judiciary Committee. Whether there 1
is any chance of this being debated 1
in the short session starting next j
month remains to be seen. Senator !
Norris of Nebraska, who was re- |

elected, heads the judiciary group.
He is an advocate of prohibition.
Although the prohibition question
was unrecognized by either major
party as a national issue in Tuesday's,
election, the controversy monopo
lized the stage in many states.
Wets and drys divided up about i
equally the senate seats in yester
day's election where prohibition was
an issue, while the anti-prohibition
ists cut into the preponderantly dry
majority in the house.
Three states holding wet referenda,
Illinois, Rhode Island and Massachu
setts—went overwhelmingly for re
peal.
The anti-prohibition forces made
one of their biggest raids in Ohio, .
birthplace of the Anti-Saloon League,
Robert J. Bulk ley, Cleveland Demo
crat. advocate of repeal of the 18th
Amendment, won over Senator Mc-
Culloch, Republican prohibitionist.
He will be the first dry law opponent
Ohio has sent to the senate in eight
years.
In other senatorial contests where
prohibition figured, the antis put
over James Hamilton Lewis in Illi
nois against the "personally dry"
Ruth Hanna McCormick and appar
ently sent Marcus A. Coolidge, Dem
ocrat, to victory in Massachusetts
against William M. Butler, Repub
lican supporter of prohibition.
Tuesday's election produced ac- j
cretions to the senate wet group from !
Ohio, Massachusetts, Illinois and
Rhode Island, and at least one dry
gain—from lowa.
Many prominent drys were re
turned to the senate too, and the big j
arid majority in that body is ex- ;
pected to be continued.
The preponderant prohibition ma
jority in the House also was cut. But
while the association against the pro
hibition amendment was claiming
big net gains in both houses the
Anti-Saloon League pointed out thai
the wets still were far below the!
neeessary two-thirds majority need- |
ed to submit a repeal amendment to 1
the states.
The anli-prohibitionists recorded
overwhelming victories in the repeal
referenda in Illinois, Rhode Island, j
and Massachusetts and provided fur- j
ther ammunition for a wet-dry bat- |
tie which the prohibitionist Borah
has forecast in the early future.
