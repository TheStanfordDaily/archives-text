# DO-X ENDS FIRST LAPS OF FLIGHTS
## Lisbon To Be Next Port Of Call On Ocean Hop 
### 
AMSTERDAM, Nov. 5. (/P).—The j
great bulk of the German Hying boat j
DO-X, largest seaplane in the world, !
floated tonight in the Echellingwoude j
Basin at the end of the first lap of !
her transatlantic voyage to New i
York.
A full moon picked out the figures |
of mechanics tinkering with the I
twelve twin-screw engines which
had borne her from Switzerland in
less than five and a half hours, and
thousands watched them at work
from the locks which protect the port
of Amsterdam against the Zuider
Zee.
Nobody knew for certain when
she would roar off again toward
Lisbon, Portugal, where the ocean
flight is to begin about November
12, but it was thought likely that
only bad weather would cause fur
ther postponement of the flight
which already had been delayed so
j long.
She had scarcely settled when a .
; squad of leather-coated mechanics
! scrambled about the motors. Com
mander Frederich Christiansen su
perintended their operations until
darkness fell.
Only sixteen passengers made the j
flight from Altenrhein today in a i
cabin large enough to accommodate [
150 or more. They saw the whole |
width of Germany pass beneath them j
and the radio operator bulletined j
their progress to land stations.
