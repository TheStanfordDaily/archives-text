## 
### 
No ticket sale is to take place for j
Brahms' "Requiem," the oratorio to j
be presented in the Memorial '
Church Armistice Day, November [
11, at 8 o'clock.
According to present plans of the i
committee in charge, two tickets are I
to be given to each member of the ]
chorus. Besides these the few re- ;
mailing tickets will be distributed j
at a later date to interested per
sons.
This well known masterpiece by
Brahms is to be given as a com- j
plete Armistice Day program on the
campus. It will be presented by the
Stanford oratorio chorus.
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, is at present directing the
chorus and is in charge of the pro
gram. Allen states that Brahms al
ways tried to bring out the human
voice and symphony orchestra in
his works rather than the organ.
This fact is clearly brought out in
the coming oratorio.
