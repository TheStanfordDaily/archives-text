# Voting Brings Upset To G.O.P. Majority Throughout Country
## Democratic Party Receives Edge in House, Almost Ties In Senate, and Landslides Illinois and New York; Ruth Hanna McCormick Badly Defeated 
### (By The Associated Press 
TURNING with furious assault upon its ancient foe, the Democratic
Party raided Republican strongholds Tuesday from coast to coast,
lifting its own favorites to new glory as it rocked state governments and
threw into serious doubt the political make-up of the new Congress.
The full extent of the off-year sweep, and whether it had carried into
office a Democratize majority in Senate or House remained undetermined

â– > today and may not be known for
j hours.
I Every indication pointed to one
of the closest divisions in years. As
matters stood overnight, Democrats
were elected or leading in sufficient
numbers to indicate a narrow
Democratis House majority and al
most a tie'in the Senate.
Democratic Landslide
In New York and Illinois, the
! Democratic strength assumed land
j slide proportions. It pushed Gover
' nor Franklin D. Roosevelt along by
| a 700,000 plurality to the re-election
| so much desired by those who want
! lo see him named for the Presi-
I dency in 19!J2. Returning James
! Hamilton Lewis to the Senate, it
j denied with thundering emphasis
j the Senatorial aspirations of Ruth
j Hanna McCormick.
! In Republican Connecticut it ele
vated a Democrat, Wilbur L. Cross,
to the governorship. In RepuTJienn
Pennsylvania it whittled to slender
proportions the lead for GilTord
Pinchot, the Republican nominee for
governor. In Republican Idaho it
! bestowed a Democratic governor
! ship on O. Ben Ross. And in Ari
| /.onu, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nc
| braska, New Mexico, Ohio, and
i Oklahoma, it pushed Democrats into
I the lead, on incomplete returns, for
| governorships now held by Repub
licans. On the same returns, a
Farmer-Laborite in Minnesota and
an Independent in Oregon were
threatening today the future tenure
I of Republican state executives.
Congress Overturned
j The Senate and House overturns
j were almost as impressive, produc
i ing surprises even among those who
j had foreseen a Democratic return of
' the pendulum after the Republican
112 sweep of 1928.
| West Virginia, Oklahoma, and
i Colorado joined Illinois in announc
! ing early the election of Democratic
j senators to succeed Republicans. In
j Ohio, home of the Anti-Saloon
| League, Robert J. Bulkley, a Demo
! crat who favors repeals of proliibi
! lion, was far ahead for the Senate
j in the overnight, returns.
A Democratic repealist, Marcus
| A. Coolidge, had the senatorial lead
i in Massachusetts, and the Demo-
I cratic senatorial nominees in Minnc
| sota and South Dakota also went
out in front during the night.
In the rock-ribbed Republican
state of Kansas Senator Henry J.
Allen, after establishing an early
lead, dropped a few hundred votes
behind his Democratic opponent.
Heeding the advice of its Demo
-1 cratic organization, Alabama was
snowing under Senator Heflin's
candidacy for re-election as an In
dependent.
Walsh of Montana, Glass of Vir
: ginia, Robinson of Arkansas, Har
rison of Mississippi, and Norris of
Nebraska, were among the senators
either elected or running well
ahead. In New Jersey, Dwight W.
Morrow had it all his own way from
1 the start.
