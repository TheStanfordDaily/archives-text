# AERIAL ATTACK FEATURES GRID PRACTICE WORK
## Cards Will Use Passes In Effort To Beat Husky Team INJURY LIST INCREASES 
### Len Kulimann 
Filling the air with footballs last
night at practice, Coach Glenn War
ner's Big Red Machine served no
tice to the Washington Huskies that,
it would take to the air Saturday

in an effort to
prove the su
premacy of
Stanford He d
over Washington
Purple and Gold.
Granting th a I
the Huskies will
boast a big,
rough crew of
linesmen as is
always the case,
the Warnermen
will resort to

passes in their search for scores.
Rothert, Moffatt, Simkins, Allen,
and Hardy all tossed the pigskin
about, with every eligible receiver
getting his share of the throws. Joe
Bush and Don Colvin looked well
in getting under the passes, Bush
in particular scampering far down
the field to gather in Allen's long
heaves.
Klevens Unchanged
Last night's session also marked
the first time that Warner has kept,
the same eleven men working to-

gether for more
than two days at
a time. Rothert,
Hillman, Moffatt,
and Caglieri
! seem to be the
Old Fox's choice
I for the first
string backfield,
while the line
was made up of
I Neill and Doub
at end, Ehrhorn.
and Bogue at

tackle, Hulen and Bardin guard,
and Perry Taylor at center.
First String Choice
The choice, by reason of this
week's practice, appears be the
: first string. The backfield, exactly as
was named by '"Dink" Templeton
during the first week or practice,
contains no surprises. To Hulen and
Ehrhorn goes the credit for crash
ing the regular lineup, for neither
was expected to be running with
the first string. Ehrhorn, replacing
the injured Tandy whose knee will
keep him out of most of the Wash
ingtoti game, has filled the post in
fine style. Hulen, by reason of his
speed and fire, has displaced poten
I tially better men from the right
i guard position.
Stanford's injury list, ;i 1 a low
1 ebb last night, was swollen to con
siderable proportions following the
scrimmages of Monday and Tues
day's practices. Joining Mar Albert-
I son and Henri Laborde, neither of
whom have b#en in uniform since
the U.S.C. game, arc three reserve
quarterbacks and a reserve end.
Phil Baker, Paul Targhetta, and
Slip Gilbert represent the quarter
backs, while Ned Clark is the end
who has been added to the sideline
j spectators.
Albertson Out
None of these new men are seri
ously incapacitated, and they should
be ready fdr practice next week.
Mar Albertson's injury causes the
most concern, the blond center be
ing definitely on the shelf for the
Washington game, with the time for
his return to practice still problem
atical. Albertson's absence weakens
the center position, and his return
I to the lineup will be quite a relief

Tandy Handicapped
Captain Ray Tandy, although tak
ing active part in a dummy scrim
mage last night, is handicapped by
his knee injury. While in fair shape,
the Card leader is still in no con
dition to turn in his usual game at
tackle. Tandy will not see much
action Saturday, and it is hoped
that he will be his old self by the
time of the California clash.
Meanwhile Washington, 40 strong,
is en route to Palo Alto, having left
Seattle last night for the Stanford
Farm. They will arrive here tonight
and camp at the Castlewood Coun
try Club until the game, working
out in the Stadium tomorrow.
