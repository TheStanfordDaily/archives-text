SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5. (/P).â€”
What a resounding smack on 'the
back the California electorate gave
James Rolph, Jr., Republican, in his
race for governor was revealed late
today when his constantly mounting
majority over Milton K. Young,
Democrat, neared the f>oo,ooo mark.
And how "Sunny Jim" was smil
ing as he reflected over the result
compared with those in other states
where many Republicans fell before
Democratic onslaughts.
Returns from 8,805 precincts out
of the stale's 10,283 gave Rolph, 884,-
403; Young, 290,010. Upton Sinclair,
Pasadena Socialist, had 37,84G.
With him, Rolph carried to victory
the entire Republican state ticket
with impressive majorities.
In the matter of measures four
teen got an emphatic O.K. v/hile
twelve lost out. Those that appeared
to have approval on the basis of re
turns from more than half the state's
precincts were: Veterans' bonds,
street railway taxation, state retire
ment salaries, San Francisco harbor
bonds, livestock indemnities, perma
nent registration, Huntington Libra
ry, regulation of corporations, ma
rine insurers' taxation, judicial dis
qualification, the municipal charter
amendments, suffrage requirements.
The other measures, especially day
light saving and Sunday closing,
were emphatically snubbed.
The regional proposal of a $35,000,-
000 bond issue to bridge the Golden
Gate went over big. Returns from
1,411 precincts out of 1,489 gave:
Yes, 137,047; No, 42,503. A two-thirds
vote was required to carry.
