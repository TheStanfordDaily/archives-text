UP TIIE RIVER—At the Varsity
Theatre.
"From first base, to second base,
to third base we roam," etc. A base
ball game is the main interest of the
institution in "Up The River," that
is, to the inmates.
Through a myriad of scenes,
jumping over fairly long periods of
time, the funny side of prison life
is depicted. The love that grew be
tween two inmates, both somewhat
victims of circumstances, forms the
sound part of the plot, which leads
ihe two to a new life at the bottom
ol the ladder after their release '
Pathos is present at times when
Steve and Judy are giving a con
vincing performance. On the whole,
it is a good picture, through a trifle
choppy. The best scene is "Saint
Louis" and his pal returning to
prison to win the game. J. N.
NOT WITHOUT LAUGHTER. Bv
Langston Huges. Knopf. (At the
Stanford Book Shop.)
"Not Without Laughter" is a
commonplace novel of Negro life
in which are touches of the ebullient
Hughes' primitive poetry. Off
setting such reminders of' East
Lynne and Uncle Tom's Cabin as
"Jimboy's yo' pappy, chile, but he
sho' ain't worth his salt" and
"They ain't no room in this wori'

I
for nothin' but love, chile" are chap
ters full of the wild ecstacy of the
Negro, such fantastic figments as
"faces gleaming like circus balloons
—the room full of floating balloons
—colored balloons with strings, the (
music pulling the strings" or "the
St. Louis Blues spread itself like a
bitter syrup over the hall."
Summing all up: interesting, with
touches of the glorious abandon pos
sible for Hughes, but not equal to '
; his other attempts. He has thrown
the cloak of conventionality over it,
a cloak effective only in concealing i
his poetry. —J. S. S.
PLAYBOY OF PARIS—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
With the aid of Stuart "Axel"
Erwin's pathetically dumb comedy,
and Frances Dee's winsomeness,
; Maurice Chevalier's latest comedy
'manages to rate as entertaining.
The inimitable Maurice is his
usual gay self, although "Playboy
of Paris" is not the best thing he ,
has done.
Chevalier is seen as a waiter in a
small cafe in Paris who inherits a
million francs, only to find himself
tied down to his job because of a
trick contract. His efforts to extri
cate himself from the contract fur
nish much of the comedy.
Eugene Pallette contributes to the
fun in a small role. —-L. M. C.
