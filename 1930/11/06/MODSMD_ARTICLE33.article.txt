Another day devoid of thought—
and the Daily goes to press, whether
we like it or not. Mid-terms are
enough to trouble a saint's calm
spirit—hut when it comes lo three
mid-terms in one day, we call for
a reservation at the Rest Home.
(Purely a preventative measure.)
Why did Justinian make a
code, and atoms make mole
cules, and French verbs make
the very devil to pay, and sun
shine make you lazy, ami
roommates make trouble by for
getting about your phone calls,
and engineers make bridges,
and the A.T.O. breakfast-cow
bell maye you mad, anyhow.
A psychology professor was tell
ing his class, about condition re
flexes, yesterday, explaining how
and why children so often fear fuzzy
animals. He told of a laboratory ex
periment in which a child w«\s
brought to fear a dog that he had
formerly liked, and so to fear all
animals because of their fur. A
voice in the dark corner of the room
suggested that the child be given a
Mexican hairless dog, to get him
used to the idea, again. And nobody
laughed.
Familiar sights, that make the
campus seem like home (Collected

by Oso Hard, Vice-President of the
| Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Sugarless Sweets):
Frosh waiting for Cit lec
tures; also gulping cups of tof
fee at nine-after-eight o'clock;
also scrambling (why all the
haste?) to get in the doors of
the Commons; also throwing
water out of Encina windows;
and a few of them tremulously
inspecting the museum. (Oso
admits here that was his first
visit, too.)
! No one at all in the art gallery
. . . a perpetually empty bicycle
i perpetually standing in front of the
Bookstore . . . someone signing a
rebate slip . . . much-wanted re
serve books signed up for long
hours ahead ... »
Copious crowd of sophomores in
! a jam in front of the P.O. . . .
juniors still breaking in newish
cords . . . the same professors
springing the same jokes, year after
year ... all parking spaces full,
down there by the English corner
. . . binders left on window sills .. .
the band practicing by the tennis
courts ... a campus cop giving a l
parking ticket . . .
Strong, handsome ''Block S"
men clumping around the Quad,
with ok - without female attend

campus seem like home (Collected

by Oso Hard, Vice-President of the
| Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Sugarless Sweets):
Frosh waiting for Cit lec
tures; also gulping cups of tof
fee at nine-after-eight o'clock;
also scrambling (why all the
haste?) to get in the doors of
the Commons; also throwing
water out of Encina windows;
and a few of them tremulously
inspecting the museum. (Oso
admits here that was his first
visit, too.)
! No one at all in the art gallery
. . . a perpetually empty bicycle
i perpetually standing in front of the
Bookstore . . . someone signing a
rebate slip . . . much-wanted re
serve books signed up for long
hours ahead ... »
Copious crowd of sophomores in
! a jam in front of the P.O. . . .
juniors still breaking in newish
cords . . . the same professors
springing the same jokes, year after
year ... all parking spaces full,
down there by the English corner
. . . binders left on window sills .. .
the band practicing by the tennis
courts ... a campus cop giving a l
parking ticket . . .
Strong, handsome ''Block S"
men clumping around the Quad,
with ok - without female attend
ants . . . somebody out of gas
on I'alm Drive. . . .
Another day devoid of thought—
and the Daily goes to press, whether
we like it or not. Mid-terms are
enough to trouble a saint's calm
spirit—hut when it comes lo three
mid-terms in one day, we call for
a reservation at the Rest Home.
(Purely a preventative measure.)
Why did Justinian make a
code, and atoms make mole
cules, and French verbs make
the very devil to pay, and sun
shine make you lazy, ami
roommates make trouble by for
getting about your phone calls,
and engineers make bridges,
and the A.T.O. breakfast-cow
bell maye you mad, anyhow.
A psychology professor was tell
ing his class, about condition re
flexes, yesterday, explaining how
and why children so often fear fuzzy
animals. He told of a laboratory ex
periment in which a child w«\s
brought to fear a dog that he had
formerly liked, and so to fear all
animals because of their fur. A
voice in the dark corner of the room
suggested that the child be given a
Mexican hairless dog, to get him
used to the idea, again. And nobody
laughed.
Familiar sights, that make the
campus seem like home (Collected
