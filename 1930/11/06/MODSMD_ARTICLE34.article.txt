! Women have been invading mas
culine fields for so long that finally
| men have decided to retaliate. At
Johns-Hopkins, they have organ
ized a men's fashion show with men
I acting as manikins.
That seems like fighting fire with
' fire. The best way to fight fire is to
let it burn itself out. The best way
to stop "masculine women" is to
treat them as men.
Soon feminity would spread
through the nation like a broken
hottie of ink in a suitcase.
The height of frankness seems to
us the football players at George
: Washington University who de-
I manded salary plus their free tui
tion and board.
The administration expelled
the athletes for their audacity;
hut one might presume that the
members of the Carnegie Insti
tute danced with righteous' joy.
A professor at the University of
Syracuse announces to the strident
body that any student might sleep
unmolested in his classes providing
the sleeper did not snore.

sleeping in classrooms. If a person
is sleepy there are more comfortable
places than a hard scat.
A famous adventurer speaking at
the University of Oregon states that
college students make very poor ex
plorers.
How can collegians he good
explorers when they get near
sighted from peering into micro
scopes; muscle hound from
turning musty pages; arthritus
from sitting in hard chairs.
