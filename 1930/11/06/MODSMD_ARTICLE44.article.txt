CRUCIAL
Not .since 1925 has a Washington
team scored a victory at the ex
pense of Stanford. Four lean years
it has been for the Northerners,
culminating in the unsuccessful sea
son of 1929, when the Huskies lost
;ill five of their Conference games
ind bounced Bagshaw from his
mentorship.
As the public press related during
the course of events, James Phelan
i»l Notre Dame, Purdue, and way
points, took up residence in Seattle
along with a group of lesser lights
who became freshman, baekficld,
and line coaches. Spring practice
ushered in a new regime. From
Hagshaw power, Washington cliang
d to the Notre Dame shift; a new
threat entered the ranks of West
•ni teams.
Bowing to the Oregon eleven un
ler Spears and having taken a bat
ered Bear, Washington will invade
he Farm tomorrow with three wins
nd a loss on her Conference rec
iid. Phelan also has victories to his
•ledit at the expense of Idaho and
VloTitana, but since Washington has

J.S.C., his season is just beginning.

cam in Seattle, a team which will

ince anything less would be trea

Stanford, slow in starting, has not
really shown what she could do yet
his season. The men are there, the
