# Frosh Gridmen Working Hard For Bear Tussle
## INJURED VETERANS RECOVERING; MAY START U.C. GAME Hillman, White Would Add Power To Babe Backfield 
### 
Leaving nothing undone in pre
paring for the tussle with the Cali
fornia freshmen in the Little Big
Game Saturday at Berkeley, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw is putting his-men
through hard scrimmages this week.
The Card babes are rounding into
shape, many of the injured men
running through the workouts in
better condition than they have been
since the U.C.L.A. struggle which
| cxippled them. Edelen, who has been
out altogether since the Bruin game,
is improved to the point that he may
start the U.C. game at his old posi
tion of left end.
White May Start
White, first string half, who has
' also been on the bench with a bad
leg since the U.C.L.A. tilt, may also
be in shape to start. Anderson sui
fered a badly bruised arm in the
Trojan contest, but will probably be
fit to play at full by Saturday.
Thus Bradshaw will have most of
â–  his old first string lineup to start
r.gainst the Bear yearlings, the same
squad which put up such a good
showing against the Bronco fresh -
i men and the Bruins the week fol
lowing.
In the backfield will be Maentz,
that hard-playing, passing halfback
who has refused to be hurt through
out the tough schedule which has
at one time or another put all of his
fellow backs under. He has started
in every game, and played more
time than any other man on the
outfit.
Maentz Star
It has been the all around work
of Maentz that has been largely re
sponsible for the good showing of
the Stanford freshmen thus far this
season. In the Trojan battle his
; passes kept the young Thundering
Herd worried, and his kicking abil
ity is an asset to the Redshirts.
, However, Anderson will probably
do the booting in the Little Big
Game.
Hillman, the line-plunging quar
terback who was also crippled by
the Bruins, will probably start Sat
urday's game, though it is a ques
tion how long he will last, as is the
case with Edelen at end.
First Siring Line
If the veteran first string gridmen
can hold up long enough to put over
a substantial lead on the Bears,
Bradshaw's chances to take Cali
fornia will be good. In reserve he
has Lipscomb, Massey, and Spencer
for the backfield, men who have
gained plenty of experience since
injuries wrecked the original "var
sity" lineup.
The line, with the exception of
Edelen at left end, will probably be
the same that started against St.
Mary's two weeks ago. However, the
right guard position is in some
doubt, with Alden, Freeman, and
Gould all possibilities.
