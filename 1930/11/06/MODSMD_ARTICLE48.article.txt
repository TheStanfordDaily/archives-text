# NO BLUSHING VIOLET

### Feg Murray, '16 
I
The captain of this year's New
! York University football team is
. Jerry Nemecek, an end, who weighs
; 167 pounds and came from Syracuse
! High School to become a prominent
member of the not-so-modest Vio
i lets. Chick Mechan, clever young
■ coach of N.Y.U., also hails' from
! Syracuse, and if any smart Aleck in
| the class thinks he can put two and
. two together and guess why a Syra
: cuse boy should come all the way
to New York to go to college, why
| he can just keep his mouth shut j
I and that's that! Why, didn't your
. Uncle Charley Moran, coach of
| Centre College's "Praying Colonels"
• who beat Harvard about eight years
ago, offer to bring a whole team
I along with him if given a Big Ten
coaching job? (P.S. He didn't get
ihe job.)
But to return to Jerry Nemecek
who may not be a Hinkey, a Shev
lin, a Muller or an Oosterbaan, but
just the same is a darn good end, i

as ends go lately. He is sort of a
cross between Donchess of the 1929
Pitt team and Fesler of Ohio {State.
Not so cagey, workmanlike, or
powerful as the former, nor £o
flashy and spectacular as the latter,
but smart, rough and ready, and a
fine tackier and pass receiver.
Personally, I think that, except in
the case of Ken Strong, New York
City is wont to overlook talent in
its own back yard, while singing the
praises of the Yale, Harvard, and
Army players. If Nemecek played
at Yale, for instance, he would be
much better known. (Heh heh, so
would I!) Among the good ends of
the country this year, the first two
of whom Nemecek will meet next
month, are Rosenzweig of Carnegie
Tech (Nov. 1), "Catfish" Smith of
Georgia (Nov. 8), Casey of Wiscon
sin, Yudicky, Dartmouth; Conley,
Notre Dame; Collins, Pitt; Moore,
Alabama; Neill, Stanford; Avery,
California; and Arbelbide, U.S.C.
