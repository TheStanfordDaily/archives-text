# SOCCER SQUAD MEETS LEGION HERE SATURDAY
## Game lo Be Played After Stanford-Washington Football Fracas 
### 
Veterans who ARE veterans will
I make up the Palo Alto American
Legion soccer team which will take
j on the Stanford varsity here Satur
day afternoon after the Stanford
| Washington football game.
Many of the members of the Le
gion squad have been playing on
j the team ever since the end of the
World War, and nearly all of them
have had several years of experience
since leaving college. The majority
of the players are former Stanford
men.
Captain Jack Quinby is a former
j Card leader and played with the
I Olympic Club team for a time after
leaving colfege. He holds down the
center halfback position. Hudson,
center forward, is another former
Winged "O" performer.
Experience then, is present in
abundance on the Palo Alto eleven
j and it will have an advantage over
I Coach Harry Maloney's varsity in
: that respect. The Cardinals, how-
I ever, will more than overbalance
: this advantage by their superior
j condition and consequent faster
play.
The Legionnaires only get about
one practice a week, which is not
l conducive to first class condition.
I On the other hand, the varsity men
i have had little work this week fol
! lowing their strenuous game with
California, and should be feeling
j fine by Saturday.
One factor that favors the Le-
I gionnaires is the fact the tilt
I will be shortened, probably to 25-
i minute halves in place of the full
j 45 minutes. Over this short distance
| the veterans may be able to spurt
i give their younger opponents
j a hard contest.
