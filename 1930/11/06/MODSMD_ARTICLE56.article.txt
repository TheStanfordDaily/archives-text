# INDIAN DRAWINGS NOW ON DISPLAY AT ART GALLERY
## Paintings Of Sacred Dances On Exhibit Under Ban Of Native Priests 
### 
Drawings by Indian artists of the
Southwest are exhibited in a dis
play which opened yesterday in the
Stanford Art Gallery. It will remain
until November 23.
These drawings, collected by
Pedro Lemos on his recent trip to
the Indian pueblos, depict the spec
tacular and colorful ceremonial
dances given during the different
seasons. Many are prayer cere
monies for rain and good harvests.
Several of the Indian artists whose
work is included in the showing at
Stanford are world noted for their
work. Among those exhibiting are
Fred Kabote, Agwi Pi, Tse-Ye-Mu,
Romando Vigil, Thomas Vigil, Rich
ard Martinez, Ma Pe Wi, and Tonita
Pena, a woman artist living at the
pueblo of Cochita on the banks of
the Rio Grande.
Because the caciques or governing
priests of the pubelos disapprove of
the Indian artists' work several of
the artists exhibiting have been
penalized for drawing pictures of
the sacred dances.
A group of drawings by Indian
school children shows over fifty In
dian designs done in the Govern
ment Indian schools.
