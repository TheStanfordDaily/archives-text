# EVOLUTION PROCESS SPEEDED BY X-RAY STATES PHYSICIST
## 
### 
The discovery and value of the
X-ray were explained over the Na
lional Broadcasting Company system '
yesterday by Karl T. Compton, |
president of Massachusetts Institute j
of Technology and world-famous
physicist.
"In the laboratory, X-ray has j
speeded up the process of evolu- j
lion," Compton said. "New species j
ol plants so developed may in time !
revolutionize agriculture."
The X-ray was declared by Comp
ton to be of enormous value in ana- j
tomical photography, in the treat- '
ment of disease, in locating flaws in j
metals, and in the study of the 1
atom.
Dr. Compton's lecture was the
first of 35 which will be broadcast
by famous scientists under the i
sponsorship of the National Research ;
Council.
A miniature golf match in Chicago j
with Johnny Farrell using a putter i
and Willie Hoppe a billiard cue, re
sulted in a victory to Farrell.
