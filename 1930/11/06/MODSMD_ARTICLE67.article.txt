### 
MADISON, Wis., Nov. 5. (/P)â€”The
University of Wisconsin athletic
council has refused to sanction the
proposed football game for charity
between the university and Mar
quette University, President Glenn
Frank said today.
"In view of the expressed policy
of the Western Intercollegiate Con
ference regarding post-season games
and in view of the fact that as a
state-supported institution, the Uni
versity of Wisconsin would not be
free to restrict the proceeds of a
benefit contest to any one city, the
athletic council does not consider
feasible the proposed post-season
game for the Milwaukee charity
fund," President Frank said.
