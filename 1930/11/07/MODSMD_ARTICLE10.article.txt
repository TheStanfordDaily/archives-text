# COAST LEAGUE TO SELECT PRESIDENT AT MEETING TODAY
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. G. (A J )â€”
Directors of the Pacific Coast League
will hold their annual baseball
meeting here tomorrow with elec
tion of a president, discussion of
the universal draft as demanded by
the major leagues, and proposals to
shorten the season and abandon the
split season, as the principal items
of business.
Selection of a president promises
to bring out the liveliest debate of
the session, which is expected to run
two clays. Harry Williams of Los
Angeles, who has handled the af
fairs of the league for the last seven
years, will be opposed by J. Cal
Ewing, former president of the Oak
land club, and Joe Bearwald, of San
Francisco, who resigned as presi
dent of the Mission club to become
a candidate.
