# Republicans Blamed For Present Depression Says Barclay

### James McGinnis 
"A party that claims credit for
sunshine must accept blame for the
rain," said Professor T. S. Barclay,
of the political science department.
'"The Republicans claimed and se
cured credit for the prosperity of
the years 1925-1929, and, fairly or
unfairly, are blamed for present
conditions. Only those whose eco
| nomie principles are derived from
! the campaign textbook of the Re
i publican party will be surprised."
Long-familiar reactions of the
electorate against the party in power
| easily explains the Republicans'
! losses, thinks Barclay.
"In its more general aspects,"
Barclay declared, "the election of
i 1930 has again demonstrated two
I traits of American party govern
| ment: First, the party in power
usually suffers substantial losses in
' the off-year elections, as conclu
sively shown by the results of 1874,
1882, 1890, 1910, and 1930. Second,
i the practice of the electorate to use
the ballots as a weapon to punish
the majority party and to vote
j against the administration, even
j though the minority is not able to
offer an alternative program."
Prohibition must be frankly faced
j by both parties in the near future,
j believes Barclay. "The mighty army
i of the thirsty is increasing daily.
After a decade of political coward
ice and hypocricy, the prohibition
: issue is emerging further to frighten
; the wet-dry and the equally ob
' noxious dry-wet politician.
"Progressives will rejoice in the
re-election of two courageous, and
liberal public men, Norris of Ne
i braska and Walsh of Montana, and
; in the victory of Edward P. Costigan
in Colorado. Public interests will be
i well served by certain governors,
notably Rooseveit, in New York,
; Pinchot, in Pennsylvania, LaFol
j lette, in Wisconsin, and Cross, in
' Connecticut.
