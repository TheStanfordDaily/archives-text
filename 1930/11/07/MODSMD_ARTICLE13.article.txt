# FRESHMAN ROUGHS STORM DOORS OF ROBLE IN ANNUAL PAJAMARINO
## 
### E. SPROTT BOYD 
Clad in the latest evening attire,
and bearing aloft the pictured face
of a freshman's dream, the Class of
'34 swept down the Row to Roble
last night in the first and last Stan
ford roughs' fashion parade of the
year.
Led by the Rally Committee, the
seething throng of frosh stopped at
the doors of Roble. There they
flourished aloft lhe pictured face of
a certain well-known young wo
man, and salaamed in deep rever
ence as if to put in their place the
co-eds who crammed every window
of the hall.
Cheers were led, but such was the
enthusiasm displ iyed that they were

( hardly distinguishable from the
1 continuous roar. The Roble maidens
J sang, and the frosh sang "Come
Join The Band" on several different
j tunes.
Spotlights flashed dizzily from one
window to another, and another
| spotlight from Roble gleamed on
i every pa jama stripe, and every red
or purple bathrobe. One sported a
coat of red and gold, but the ma
jority of tastes turned to a conven
-1 tional gray, with perhaps lavender
stripes for trimming.
There was a last cheer, and with
a roar the band swept off on its
way, still muttering the battle cry,
"To hell with the Gold and Blue."
