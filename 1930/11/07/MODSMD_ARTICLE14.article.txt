# MINING TOWN STUNNED BY DEATH OF 79
## Search Continues For Ohio Disaster Victims As Toll Mounts 
### 
MILLFIELD, Ohio, Nov. 6. (/P>—
i Tho inhabitants of this little mining
i village who were spared in the ex
, plosion at the Sunday Creek Coal
| Company's No. (5 mine resumed
i their normal ways tonight although
i still stupefied by yesterday's disas
| ter. The explosion killed 79 persons,
1 including seven i-fTicials of the Sun
i day Creek Company, and injured 20
j others, who are in hospitals. Some
| of the injured are expected to die.
There was a possibility, officials
I said, that other bodies were still in
the mine and might never be re
; covered. It was feared several
others may have been blown to
, pieces by the explosion in the shaft
| or buried by falling walls and ccil
i ings.
Bodies Recovered
State and federal investigations
| were under way but actual search
I of the ruined "West Eight" tunnel
! for the scene and cause of the ex
plosion will not be undertaken un
til tomorrow. J. J. Forbes, Director
jof the United States Bureau of
Mines at Pittsburgh, will be in
charge. He will be assisted by W. E.
| Smith, Chief of the Ohio Bureau
i of Mines.
Rescue work continued through
out last night and the last of the 79
1 bodies had been removed before
; noon today.
I The bodies of 70 dead miners lay
in the Company store here until
i prepared for burial and claimed by
their families. They were then
turned over to relatives for private
; burial and these solemn, pathetic
i rituals will be l-ecited many times
tomorrow.
Identification was complete this
afternoon except for one body, the
Red Cross announced.
Officials Killed
Members of an inspection party
which was approaching a recently
constructed air shaft a mile and a
: half from the main entrance were
killed instantly by the explosion.
They included W. E. Tytus, presi
j dent, and P. A. Coen, vice-president
of the company, both of Columbus,
and representatives of other mining
companies. Their bodies were sent
home for burial.
Smith, Ohio Chief of Mines, said
il would be possible to determine
both the site and cause of the ex
plosion. Speculation turned chiefly
! to the presence of gas in the mine
and the possibility that a spark
from open lamps may have ignited
• it.

There was a possibility, officials
I said, that other bodies were still in
the mine and might never be re
; covered. It was feared several
others may have been blown to
, pieces by the explosion in the shaft
| or buried by falling walls and ccil
i ings.
Bodies Recovered
State and federal investigations
| were under way but actual search
I of the ruined "West Eight" tunnel
! for the scene and cause of the ex
plosion will not be undertaken un
til tomorrow. J. J. Forbes, Director
jof the United States Bureau of
Mines at Pittsburgh, will be in
charge. He will be assisted by W. E.
| Smith, Chief of the Ohio Bureau
i of Mines.
Rescue work continued through
out last night and the last of the 79
1 bodies had been removed before
; noon today.
I The bodies of 70 dead miners lay
in the Company store here until
i prepared for burial and claimed by
their families. They were then
turned over to relatives for private
; burial and these solemn, pathetic
i rituals will be l-ecited many times
tomorrow.
Identification was complete this
afternoon except for one body, the
Red Cross announced.
Officials Killed
Members of an inspection party
which was approaching a recently
constructed air shaft a mile and a
: half from the main entrance were
killed instantly by the explosion.
They included W. E. Tytus, presi
j dent, and P. A. Coen, vice-president
of the company, both of Columbus,
and representatives of other mining
companies. Their bodies were sent
home for burial.
Smith, Ohio Chief of Mines, said
il would be possible to determine
both the site and cause of the ex
plosion. Speculation turned chiefly
! to the presence of gas in the mine
and the possibility that a spark
from open lamps may have ignited
• it.
