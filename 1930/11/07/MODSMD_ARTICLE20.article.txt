# POLICE DISPEL RIOTING FROSH
## Pajama-Clad Babes Fail In Theatre Crash Attempt 
### 
Armed heavily enough to stop a
civil war, Palo Alto police shattered
the hopes of freshman pajamarino
paraders who attempted to crash
the Varsity and Stanford theaters
last night.
On the campus, celebration of the
underclassmen made itself felt by a
raid on Roble Hall, a parade in the
library, and the collection of red
lanterns used on construction work
on the campus.
George Robinson, one of the
paraders, is in Ihe Palo Alto Hos
pital suffering from what hospital
officials declared to be a fractured
leg. Robinson, riding on the run
ning board of a car, was hurled to
the pavement when the vehicle was
sideswiped by another. Robinson is
under the care of Dr. Blake Wilbur.
Police Chief A. G. Zink person
ally directed the operations of his
men at the Varsity theater. Plain
clothesmen milled through the
crowd with tear bombs and guns
ready for any emergency. A patrol
wagon and detachment of traffic
policemen met the frosh at the
Stanford theater.
Total damage of the Palo Alto
downtown raid was the destruction
of a flower pot by a pajama-clad
freshman.
