# POLICY OF BRIAND FLAYED IN CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES TODAY
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 6 (/P).â€”Aristide Bri
and's foreign policy, particularly
with reference to rapprochement
with Gerjnany, came under heavy
fire in the chamber of deputies to
day.
Franklin - Bouillon, opposition
deputy, delivered the main attack
this afternoon. Briand probably will
reply tomorrow.
Despite the fact that Franklin-
Bouillon expressed sentiments which
apparently pleased supporters of the
Tardieu government, it was gener
ally thought that the dilemma in
which they would place the govern
ment if they should repudiate the
foreign minister will prevent de
fections that would endanger the
life of the cabinet.
