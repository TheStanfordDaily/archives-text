CHICAGO, Nov. 6. (/P)â€”'The per
fection of an iron frame which
makes it possible for a person to
suffer a broken leg one day and
walk on it the next, was announced
before a joint session of the Ameri
can Association of Railway Surgeons
and the Surgical Association of the
Chicago & Northwestern Railway.
After the bone has been set the
fractured leg is placed in a cast
around which the "walking iron" is
placed. On the following day the
patient can walk about and even
return to his or her work.
