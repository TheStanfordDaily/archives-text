# Stanford To Face Huskies In Crucial Conference Game
## Washington Encamped at Castlewood Country Club; To Take Short Workout in Stadium Today; Outcome of Game Seen as Toss-Up CONDITION OF LAPPENBUSCH HELD DOUBTFUL 
### LEN KULLMANN 
OAFELY encamped at Castlewood Country Club, a snarling band of
Huskies awaits the opening whistle at 2 o'clock tomorrow in the
Stanford Stadium, while last night Coach Glenn Warner put the Cardinal
crew through a short but intensive drill in preparation lor the clash
between the football teams of Stanford and Washington.
Pointing for Stanford, Phelan and his men today will take a light
workout in the Stadium to accustom themselves to the turf of the field.

I' Although the condition of Lappcn
busrh, lirst string Washington guard,
is questionable, (he remainder of
(lie quad will he fit for the fray 011
the morrow.
Crucial Clash
For Stanford, the tilt tomorrow
! means make or break. A win spells
much for the games to come, a loss

will indicate a
ruined season, a
season which
cannot be saved
by wins from
California an d
I) artmout h.
Whether the
varsity plays up
to its capabili
ties or falls
down on the job
remains to be
seen.

Giving the starting lineup a dum
my scrimmage against. Washington
plays last night, Warner prepared
the men lor the style of offense they
will meet. Another scrimmage is
slated for today, although no morn
than a light workout, can be ex
pected on the day before the game.
Although a trifle undecided wheth
er to start Rothert or Siinkins at
full back, in order to save one of
his punters, Warner will probably
start the former.
Huskies Tough
Shifting, versatile Washington will
tangle with the Cards on even terms.
Always possessing material for a
big line and powerful backfield, the
Purple and Gold clad hosts intend
to shoot the works against the
Warnermen. Passes and power plays
will be sprinkled with reverses and
laterals, and the staunch Husky
line boasting of experienced tackles
should make things interesting.

But Stanford,
yet to show what
she can do, will
carry the confi
fidence of the
Farm. Playing
the type of ball
Warner teams
are capable of,
the 1930 Big Red
Machine c a n
crush Washing
ton. Generally
slow in starting,

the Redshirts begin to pick up mo
mentum late in the season, and the
Washington game should show
whether this year will be an ex
ception.
Phil Moffatt will call plays for
the team, allaying any rumors re
