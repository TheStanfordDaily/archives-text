# SUNSHINE AND FOOTBALL
## 
### 
It's mid-quarter time on the Farm. Overhead the warm sun
shines, casting a drowsy glare on Stanford activities. Tomorrow
this same sun will cast more lazy rays on the Stanford stadium
where the football teams of Stanford and the University of Wash
ington will clash in what may prove a hotly contested game.
Tomorrow ])hysical apathy probably will reign as it has on
other warm, sunny days. Tomorrow, student rooters will have the
last chance before the annual l>ig (lame. November 22. to work in
unison on Stanford veils and souses.
Mid-quarters, drowsiness, and procrastinating tendencies might
well he forgotten tomorrow when the two thousand Stanford
rooters gather in the huge bowl to cheer the Cardinals to victors
over the panting Huskies from the Northwest institution.
