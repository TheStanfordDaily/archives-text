The I niversitv of Wisconsin has refused to permit its football
loam to engage in post-season games with the view of giving all
profits from such encounters to the poor and needy of the state of
Wisconsin.
This action on the part of the Wisconsin authorities definitely
settles for them the suggestion raised by idealists that proceeds of
football games might be distributed among the destitute of America
to care for their present needy condition.
Undoubtedly the proposal is an excellent one in theory; it loses
strength when the practical aspects of the problem are considered.
Questions are raised as to the equal distribution of these so-called
fabulous gridiron profits, the needs of the institution playing, and
manv other questions that do not arise when the idealists broach
their plans.
American colleges and universities should do all in their power
to co-operate with those handling the present unemployment situa
tion and the present condition of the needy people, but they all
should balk at the proposal to stage post-season games in many
cities of the country for relief purposes.
