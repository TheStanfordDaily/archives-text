Fvery Friday during the tool brill season I'.C.L.A. stages a pep
rallv with a Los Angeles dance orchestra maestro, his band, and
complete chorus (feminine) as the feature attraction. Thus far
1 lie southern students have been entertained bv George Olsen and
his revue, the Cotton Club Creoles, and the Ambassador and liilt
morc bands. Needless to say, pep rallies at I'.C.L.A. are a big
success.
Perhaps if the Stanford Rally Committee could promote similar
programs, the usual run of speeches could lie neatly interspersed
with "I I -ost My (ial From Memphis," or "Co 1 lome and Tell Your
Mother." Fop might learn to chant his light talk a la Phil Harris,
while a beautiful chorus of twenty keep time as the cheer leaders
direct the students in ;i "New Spell" or "Skyrocket."
11 \s a great idea !
