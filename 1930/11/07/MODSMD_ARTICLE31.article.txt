# BUILDING REPUTATION
## 
### 
The spoken word went out over the country Wednesday when
Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, broadcasted from Stanford the intimate details of the
life of N-ray. The talk was the First of a series of 35 broadcasts to
be sponsored by the National Research Council.
Stanford was fortunate in having this visiting world-famed
phvsicist broadcast the first of the series. Stanford has been and is
noted for its scientific excellence. Dr. Coinpton's address increased
the scope of this reputation.
