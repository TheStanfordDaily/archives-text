# SHE TALKED BACK TO THE SENATE
## 
### 
Swamped under an overwhelming majority of I )cmocratic votes,
Kuth Manila McCormick, first woman to aspire to a scat in the
Senate, went down to defeat in Tuesday's election. I Icr opponent,
lames I lamilton Lewi*, was returned to t ongress with thundering
emphasis by Illinois.
Mrs. McCormick, "personally dry"' and an opponent of the
World Court, may or may not have been qualified for the Senate
post. She didn't get it. but she certainly didn't fail for lack of
endeavor.
The Senate, possibly motivated by the woman-in-our-midst-idea,
decided that Mrs. McCormick was spending too much money in her
Illinois campaign. An investigation was instituted, with committee
hearings and detectives and all the trimmings.
The candidate was "shadowed": her private files were broken
into—all in a most un-Scnatorial manner. When she learned of
the committee's methods, she hired her own detectives. The investi
gators were investigated, and some readable, though distasteful, dis
closures were made. The Senate investigation appeared to ac
complish nothing at all.
When it was all over, and the last ballot had been counted, vic
torious Senator-elect Lewis declared. "Mrs. McCormick fought
valiant a fight as any man ever did." She put up a good fight.
She will be remembered not alone as the woman who wanted to be
a senator, but also as the woman who could fight back.
