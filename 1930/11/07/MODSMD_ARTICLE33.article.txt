THE REDLAKES. By Francis Brett
Young. Harper and Brothers,
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop).
Rich in life is Francis Brett
Young's latest novel, "The Red
| lakes," a really fine work in which
, the author follows the career of an
English novelist's son from his boy
hood days to his marriage.
In spite of its more than 600 pages,
"The Redlakes" is very rarely tedi
ous or dull. The pageantry of exis
tence in rural England, in London,
in Africa, and in the war, is de
t scribed in a cultured, understanding,
and sympathetic manner which
1 vaguely reminds one of Galsworthy's
in his > "Forsythe Saga."
Young, in this volume expresses
a continual and ever fresh exulta
tion in life, a conviction that
whether existence be cruel, painful,
or happy, it nevertheless contains
an abundant joy, an elixer that is
good. Galsworthy's works seem to
carry the same belief, although in ;i
different degree.

PARIS IN SPRING. At the Curran
Theater, San Francisco.
It is all too seldom that we have
an opportunity to see operettas such'
as "Paris in Spring," which made
its American premiere in San Fran
' cisco this week. It is a delightful
presentation, well-staged, gorgeous
ly produced and filled with catching
melodies.
The setting is Montmartre and the
story of three artists, a grisette and a
little street singer is unfolded in
three glamorous acts. Allan Priot
as Paul, a painter, is good, as usual.
The new star, Li Hi Segrena, plays

j the role of Violetta, the singer. She
1 has a remarkably fine voice besides
being pretty and a good actress.
Max Dill of Kolb and Dill fame
takes care of the comedy as the
i court bailiff. However, he is almost
! overshadowed by Richard Powell in
I the part of the absurd general.
The sets are beautiful, the
j choruses well-trained and the music
by Kalman outstanding. Such songs
jas "I Sing My Song In Rain and
; Snow," and"The Moon Shines
Down," will be difficult to forget.

[ THE TREASURER'S REPORT and
OTHER ASPECTS OF COM
MUNITY SINGING. By Robert
Benchley. New York: Harpcr
& Bros. 1930. (At the Stanford
Bookstore).
Benehley's latest book is similar to
j the others of his works with the
I long and amusing titles. Some of the
' essays are very comical while others
j which are not so well done cause
his style to become boring for a time.
Among the gems of this volume
j are: "Ask Me a Question," in
which the prying habits of modern
| psychologists are satirized; "New
i Plays for Old," yhich consists of
| plays, wit)? their explanations, which
'the author wrote for Mei Lan-fang;
I and "Football Rules, or Whatever
1 They Are."
Best of all is an article which ap
peared in the Bookman some time
| ago, entitled "The King's English;
Not Murder But Suicide." The
i musical and meaningless speech of
| English actors is described here in
the course of a note upon the ex
tremely gloomy outlook for the
i language in general.
