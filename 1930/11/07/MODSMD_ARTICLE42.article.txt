In his second lecture on the "Re
quiem" Warren D. Allen, University
organist, described it as "not pianis
tic or dramatifc, but placid, personal,
and intimate." "Although it is not
a war memorial," he said, "there is
no more appropriate work for
Armistice Day."
Descriptive selections of the "Re
quiem" were played on the organ.
It was written by Brahms ni 1805
after the death of his mother.
