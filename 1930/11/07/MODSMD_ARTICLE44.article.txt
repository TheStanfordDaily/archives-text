## [illigible]vinoff Declares Europe Faces Increasing War Menace 
### 
JENEVA, Switzerland, Nov. (5 (TP;,
iesuming its efforts to draft a
neral Disarmament Convention,
League of Nations preparatory
armament commission had its
1 sitting today enlivened by an
K-k from Maxim Litvinoff, Soviet
eii>n minister.
he Russian delegate, in a declar
m declared out of order by
airman Loudon, denounced the
omission for having rejected the
/iet disarmament proposals at
lier sessions, spoke with sarcasm
the "speed"' with which the
•gue's disarmament program is
'aneing and told the assembled
tesmen that Europe faces grave
r menaces.
iince the commission met last in
spring of 1929, he said, new an
onisms, both political and eco
nic have arrayed nation against
ion in a hostile posture and cre
'l a situation dangerous for world
ice. His attack was particularly
ected against that school of po
cal thought which demands se
'ity before disarmament,
'he American delegation, which
ludes Hugh S. Gibson, ambassa
• to Belgium, refrained from par
pat ing in today's discussion but
lbtless will take part in tomor
v's discussion of the methods of
/;il limitation. Gibson only re
it'.y visited Rome and Paris where
made efforts to bring about a
inco-Italian agreement on the
/al problem.
litvinoff s address today was the
iter oj a slight flurry. The chair
n ruled that it should not be
n.slated into French, as customary,
the ground that it was out of or
because it has been agreed that
lei al discussion of matters already
lied should not come up. Litvi
f, however, went ahead with his
•ech and finished it.
