WASHINGTON. No. 6 (/P).â€”
Facts concerning the Swedish me
thod of liquor control, known as the
Bratt system, were laid before
President Hoover's law enforcement
commission today by John H. Moce
head, American minister to Sweden
as part of the commission's investi
gation into various liquor control
systems.
The law enforcement group al
ready is deep in its (ask of preparing
a report on just what, if anything,
they believe should be done about
the dry law in this country.
Considerable speculation at first
surrounded the request to the
American minister that he appear,
but assurance was given later that
the commission will also have before
it facts and figures concerning the
Canadian system and other control
plans in virtually every part of the
world in which they exist.
