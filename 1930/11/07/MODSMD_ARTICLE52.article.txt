# FENCING ADVOCATED BY CUBAN SENORITA
## 
### 
HAVANA, Nov. G (/P). â€”Those
glamorous duellists of old Spain who
lived, loved and died by the skill
of a flashing rapier may rest un
easily in their ancient graves for the
modern senorita in Havana is giving
fencing a whirl as an antidote for
avoirdupois.
For the past week seven comely
Cuban girls have fenced with an
instructor on I.a Playa Beach near
here. They said they expected the
vigorous exercise would not only
help to keep "that girlish figure" but
would develop added grace and poise
as well.
