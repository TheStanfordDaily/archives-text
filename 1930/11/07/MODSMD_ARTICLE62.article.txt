## 
### 
Next Tuesday a representative of
the State Highway Patrol will meet,
members of the Board of Public-
Safety and other officials of the city
here for the purpose of discussing
the general problem of traffic pro
tection at the intersections with El
Camino Real, along the Palo Alto
frontage, according to word received
yesterday from Sacramento by
Mayor C. H. Christensen.
At a recent conference in Palo
Alto it was decided to request per
mission of the State Highway Com
mission to install automatic traffic
signals at the University avenue and
Embarcadero road crossings. It is
expected that the answer of the
commission to the request will be
made next Tuesday.
