STORM SIGNALS «
In 1027, a good Stanford varsity
journeyed to Seattle to eke out a
13-7 win from the "mediocre"
Huskies in the last minutes of play.
With "Biff Hoffman and "Spud"
Harder teaming together to block
a punt on a muddy Washington 7-
yard line in the final period, the ball
bounded over the goal line where
Louie Vincenti downed it to break
a 7-7 deadlock.

11 was fight that saved that game j
for Stanford. Playing against a liig,
bruising Washington team in their
own muddy, rain-soaked back yard,
it took the keen mind of the Old
Fox to devise a play to block Wash
ington's Licks plus the drive of
I tollman to turn the day into vic
tory.
* * *
Sweeping down from the North
with a "demoralized" ball club due j
to internal disstntion and fraternity
war, as the newspapers had it, the
Purple and Gold menace took a 12-0
defeat at the hands of the Cards.
AI least, that is what the records
I. 11.
♦* * !
I>ut those who saw the game are
stil! talking about how Chuck Car
roll gained the All-American team
and made Stanford look extremely
ill on one and the same sunny after
noon. Passing, punting, driving Car
roll was the whole Washington team
that afternoon, and bis defensive
work kept the Cardinals at bay dur
ing the game.
* * * i
Washington gained ground all over
the field, only to lose the ball on
downs or pass fruitlessly over the
goal whenever scoring opportunities
offered. Meanwhile Stanford, on two
tosses from Simkins to Muller, from
150 yards out, scored twice. Long
lanky Paul Jessup blocked both tries
for point merely because the Cards
could not fit one over his head, and
Jessup was partially responsible for
the Card's second score when he
batted a pass into Muller's arms.
Again invading the North in
the Redshirts met a "hopeless" |
Husky team. Warfare over Bag
sltaw's regime raised merry Hades
with the team which did not win a j
conference clash. But this same out
lit, after seeing Stanford shove over
six points within the first ten min
utes of play, came back and not
only out-gained, but almost out
fought the Cards. Mud-stained
moleskins hanging in the gym the
week after, gave mute testimony to
the weather conditions in Washing
ton.
*!« * *
For the past throe years, California
and Stanford have met similar op- '
position from the Huskies, and have 1
won by almost identical scores. This
year the Washington team holds a
13-0 victory over the Golden Bears.
What does tomorrow hold in store
for the Cardinals?
* * *
Whether they were condemned as
impossible or not, the Huskies al
ways managed to give Warner many
anxious moments in the past. A
big, tough line plus some driving,
power backs always spells trouble,
and Washington managed to dig up
a few of these when she played the
Farm boys.
* * *
In fact, no matter whether Stan
ford has gone to Seattle or Washing
ton came to Palo Alto, storm signals
fly on the week-end they clash.
Rain in the North and fireworks in
the South have been the accom
paniment of the pitched battles re
sulting when Redshirt meets Husky.
* * *
And now with a new coach and
a new style of play which lias added
speed to power and proved itself
by a victory over California, it is a
doubly dangerous group of gridiron
heroes which will do battle with the
Cardinal cohorts tomorrow. Tough
when they were said to be easy, we
await in no easy frame of mind the
debut of an admittedly gifted Husky
horde.
