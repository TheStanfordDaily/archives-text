Overshadowed by major grid tus
sles being settled by their respective
varsity outfits, the freshmen teams
of Stanford and California will
tangle in the Little Big Game to
morrow at 2 o'clock, in the Cali
fornia Memorial Stadium.
The Card yearlings will be at
tempting to make it three straight
over their Blue and Gold rivals,
while the Bears will be fighting hard
to attone for defeats suffered at the
hands of Stanford for the last tvVo
years.
The battle has more or less re
solved itself into a combat for sec
ond place in the mythical "Little
Big Three" championship standing,
U.S.C. having cinched the lead for
the third consecutive year by wins
over both elevens.
Chances Even
Fans who choose to forsake the
rooting ranks of the varsity con
tests to take in this traditional scrap
will probably witness a hard fought,
cven-steven ball game. That is the
opinion of Coach Jimmy "Rabbit"
Bradshaw in summing up the Card
chances.
"There are three teams which we
have both played," Bradshaw said,
"and comparative scoi'es in these
contests give us a slight edge. The
Card and Bear games with Sacra
mento Junior College resulted in tie
scores, while both teams downed the
Santa Clara freshmen. We put up
a better battle against U.S.C., how
ever, fighting them to a 25 to 14
count, while they trounced Cali
fornia, 27 to 0."
Weight Edge
This edge Bradshaw speaks of will
be offset by three factors which
tend to favor the Bear Cubs. The
U.C. yearlings will outweigh the
Card line about 12 pounds to the
man.
Injuries, which have bothered
Bradshaw's warriors all season, may
prove another handicap to the Red
shirt chances. Though the first
string men will all start the con
test, it is a question how they can
hold up Saturday.
Quarterback Hillman, who has
been out with a wrenched shoulder
since the St. Mary's game, might be
easily re-injured in Saturday's
struggle. White, half, may have to
come out of the fray if his weakened
leg goes bad on him.
Edelen will be starting at end in
rather poor shape, and Kantzer, first
string center, will not be in condi
tion to start, Buller taking his place
in the starting lineup.

Overshadowed by major grid tus
sles being settled by their respective
varsity outfits, the freshmen teams
of Stanford and California will
tangle in the Little Big Game to
morrow at 2 o'clock, in the Cali
fornia Memorial Stadium.
The Card yearlings will be at
tempting to make it three straight
over their Blue and Gold rivals,
while the Bears will be fighting hard
to attone for defeats suffered at the
hands of Stanford for the last tvVo
years.
The battle has more or less re
solved itself into a combat for sec
ond place in the mythical "Little
Big Three" championship standing,
U.S.C. having cinched the lead for
the third consecutive year by wins
over both elevens.
Chances Even
Fans who choose to forsake the
rooting ranks of the varsity con
tests to take in this traditional scrap
will probably witness a hard fought,
cven-steven ball game. That is the
opinion of Coach Jimmy "Rabbit"
Bradshaw in summing up the Card
chances.
"There are three teams which we
have both played," Bradshaw said,
"and comparative scoi'es in these
contests give us a slight edge. The
Card and Bear games with Sacra
mento Junior College resulted in tie
scores, while both teams downed the
Santa Clara freshmen. We put up
a better battle against U.S.C., how
ever, fighting them to a 25 to 14
count, while they trounced Cali
fornia, 27 to 0."
Weight Edge
This edge Bradshaw speaks of will
be offset by three factors which
tend to favor the Bear Cubs. The
U.C. yearlings will outweigh the
Card line about 12 pounds to the
man.
Injuries, which have bothered
Bradshaw's warriors all season, may
prove another handicap to the Red
shirt chances. Though the first
string men will all start the con
test, it is a question how they can
hold up Saturday.
Quarterback Hillman, who has
been out with a wrenched shoulder
since the St. Mary's game, might be
easily re-injured in Saturday's
struggle. White, half, may have to
come out of the fray if his weakened
leg goes bad on him.
Edelen will be starting at end in
rather poor shape, and Kantzer, first
string center, will not be in condi
tion to start, Buller taking his place
in the starting lineup.
Stalling lineups us named by the
rival coaches are as follows:
