# BREAKERS TROUNCE JAPANESE, 34-6 IN MURAL GRID GAME
## 
### 
Overwhelmed by superior weight,
height, and speed, the Japanese Club
lost to Breakers 34-G yesterday af
ternoon, but they had the distinc
tion of being the first team Lo cross
the Breakers' goal line this season.
On the first play of the second
half Takesaka, though on the dead
run and hemmed in by opponents,
got off a swift, accurate pass which
Imai took over his shoulder while
running at top speed, and made good
for a 75-yard run to the Breakers'
three-yard line. The Japanese then
started what looked like a left-end
run, but turned out to be a right
end pass, good for a touchdown.
Most of the Breakers' scoring was
due to the long passing of Zaches
and sweeping end runs behind good
interference.
After having lost a touchdown on
account of an off-side penalty, Se
quoia II took advantage of a poor
pass from center to touch an A.T.O.
back behind his goal for a 2-0 vic
tory.
In the other scheduled game
Sigma Chi won by default from the
Chi Psi's.
