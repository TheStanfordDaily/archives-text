# POLOISTS TO MEET MONTEREY FOUR IN INITIAL APPEARANCE
## 
### 
Stanford's polo squad will make
its first appearance of the season on
Friday, November 21, in a game to
be played here with the crack
Monterey Presidio four, according
to arrangements now being com
pleted.
Captain R. A. Gordan, polo coach,
is greatly pleased with the rapid
progress being made by both the
A and B squads this year.
"The B squad is better now than
the A squad was two years ago," he
said at the conclusion of yesterday's
practice. "If the new boys keep up
the good work, they can be scrim
maged during the winter quarter."
Revell, Lewis, Captain MacDou
gall, and Fleming will probably
compose the starting lineup in the
Monterey game. Captain Gordan,
however, plans to use at least two
complete teams in the contest, each
to play half the game.
During the winter quarter a game
will probably be played here with
either the University of Arizona or
Lniversity of New Mexico quartets,
according to Captain Gordan.
