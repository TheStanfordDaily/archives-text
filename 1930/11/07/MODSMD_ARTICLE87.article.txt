# FORWARD PASSING FAILS; MILK QUART SHATTERS WINDOW
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. G (/P).â€”The for
ward passing combination of Edward
Witt and his milkman, Aaron Swan
son, apparently has struck a snag.
"I don't know all the football
rules," Witt told the magistrate, "but
that milkman was offside or some
thing and I want him penalized two
yards of window pane."
For weeks the two had been prac
ticing. Each morning the milkman,
with unerring aim, passed a quart
of milk some twenty feet from the
street to Witt, who always caught
the toss without a miss. All of this
happened each morning just as Witt
was leaving for work. Yesterday,
however, Witt was late in leaving
for work. As he started from the
door, he charges, his daily quart
came crashing through the window.
