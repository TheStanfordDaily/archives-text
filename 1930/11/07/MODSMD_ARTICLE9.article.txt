# Business, Prohibition failures Hurt G.O.P.
## Wet Issue Responsible For Democratic Success Says Cottrell 
### Beatrice Bishop 
"I think that the increase in the
number of Democratic congressmen
is a good thing, because it keeps
the party in pow?r on its toes," de
clared Professor Edwin A. Cottrell,
head of the political science depart
ment, in commenting on the out
come of the recent election. "I
agree with many people who say
that if the party has strong opposi
tion, the officers will play belter
ball.
"The election results merely show
the natural off-year swing to the
opposition party. The Democratic
success is due more to the wet issue
than to the idea of depression dur
ing the Hoover administration. The
big changes which came in Illinois,
Ohio, New York, Connecticut, arid
Massachusetts were due primarily
to the fact that ihe Democrats were
backing the wet program.
Roosevelt Strong
'"The huge vote which elected the
governor of New York was due to
Roosevelt personally and to the fact
that he is wet. Roosevelt, by that
vote, becomes the logical Democratic
candidate for the next presidential
election.
''But in California, prohibition had
practically nothing to do with the.'
outcome. It might have had some
slight influence in the election of
Rolph, but his win is due more to
the fact that California is a strong
Republican state. A Democrat in this
state is iike a Republican in the
South—he is an unknown quantity.
The fact that we are sending nine
non-partisan men to Congress who
represented both parties on the bal
lot shows how party sentiment is
broken down in the West. Non
partisan officers are unknown in
the East.
