# R-101 RECEIVED NO TRIAL FLIGHT SAYS AVIATION MINISTER
## Vice Marshall Testifies That Instructions Were Not Obeyed 
### 
LONDON, Nov. U (/P),-Hugh
Down ng, a vice marshal of the Air
Ministry, created a sensation today
at the inquiry into the R-101 disas
ter, by testifying he had ordered a
full power trial as soon as possible
after the dirigible had left her moor
ing mast on the Indian voyage, but
that his instructions were not
obeyed.
The ship had never had a full
power trial, he said, and he issued
the order as a safeguard, figuring
that if anything went wrong the
R-101 could immediately turn back
to England.
The Vice-Marshall said ho had
given his instructions verbally to
the Wing-Commander, Colmore,
who perished in the crash.
It aiso was brought out that Lord
Thomson, the air minister, who also
was killed, had issued a certifi
cate of air worthiness without a
formal written report on the one
trial to which the dirigible had been
submitted.
Before the certificate was issued
there was a final inspection which
took two men about two hours. The
ship started for India before these
inspectors had time to make a
formal written report, he said.
