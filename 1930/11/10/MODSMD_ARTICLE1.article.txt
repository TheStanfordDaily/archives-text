# GAME TICKETS TO BE CHECKED SOON BY B.A.C.
## Approximately 100 Names Will Be Investigated For Committee ACTION NOT DECIDED 
### 
As a result of the action taken by
the Rally Committee to prevent
transfer of'rooters' tickets, approxi
mately one hundred names and tick
ets will be checked by the Board of
Athletic Control within the next
few days, according to Jake Irwin,
manager of the ticket department.
Hooters were watched by members
of the Rally Committee as they en
tered the section, said Ernest Hatch,
Rally Committee member, and peo
ple who were suspected of not being
students were asked to sign their
names to pieces of cardboard which
were attached to their rooters' tick
ets and handed in to the B.A.C.
Complete Check
Since the B.A.C. has a record of
the seat given each student, and the
signatures of all students who have
applied for rooters' tickets, a com
plete check can be made.
Names of students who arc guilty
of transferring their rooters' tickets
and breaking the pledge which ev
ery student is required to sign in
applying for tickets, will be turned
in to Men's and Women's Councils
for further action, Hatch said. The
names will probably be checked to
day.
Will Continue Action
The action taken at Saturday's
game will be continued at future
games, according to the Rally Com
mittee chairman. It has proved con
clusively that transfer of rooters'
section tickets is a common practice.
Of the approximately one hundred
names turned in, three were those
of women.
