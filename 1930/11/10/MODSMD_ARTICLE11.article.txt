# PARACHUTE JUMPS TO BE ATTEMPTED ON ARMISTICE DAY
## 
### 
FRESNO, Nov. 9. (/J 3 ) â€”George
Sallee, Fresno parachute jumper,
will attempt to break the world's
free-fall record as a part of the
American Legion Armistice Day
celebration here next Tuesday.
Sallee, wearing two parachutes,
will attempt to make a free fall of
8,000 feet before releasing one of
his "chutes."
The present official record is said
to be 1,500 while there is an unof
ficial record of 6,000 feet. Army fliers
at the San Francisco Presidio said
today there were various authenti
cated but unofficial records of fliers
falling as far as 4500 feet before
opening their parachutes.
Army tests show the maximum
speed obtained by a human body
falling is approximately 200 feet a
second or 135 miles an hour. Sallee
said he has reached this speed on
several occasions and never felt any
ill effects from such plunges.
