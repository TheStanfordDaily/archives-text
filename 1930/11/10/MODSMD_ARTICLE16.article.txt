### 
ROOSEVELT FIELD, N.Y., Nov.
9. (/P) —Captain Frank M." Hawks,
who casually flies his low-winged
monoplane hither and yon, setting
all sorts of speed records between
widely separated cities, arrived from
Havana at 4:18 o'clock today with a
new mark in his possessio.n.
The famous flier, who holds the
records for transcontinental flight
and for speedy traveling between
several cities of North America, had
hoped to make today's flight in
seven hours. Although his time was
considerably longer than that, it was
th£ fastest ever made between the
two cities.
Recently Hawks flew to Havana
from New York in 9 hours and 21
minutes.
