# AUSTRIAN ELECTION UPSETS SOCIALISTS
## 
### 
VIENNA, Nov. 9. (/P)—First re
! turns in the Austrian general elec
tion today indicated the Christian
Social Party had lost a considerable
number of legislative seats to the
National Economic Party, which re-
I cently was formed by Dr. Johann
Schober.
Dr. Schober, regarded as some
! what of a "strong man" in Austria,
| formerly was chief of police in
I Vienna and then became chancellor.
He was forced to resign the latter
position this summer.
In Austrian politics formerly the
chief fight was between Social
Democrats, commonly known as So
cialists, and the Christian Socials,
! but the entry of the Fascist Heim-
I wehr gave a picturesque note to th»
campaign. The Fascists, led by
Prince Ernest Rudigcr von Starhem
bcrg, favor a dictatorship. They
v/ear brown shirts, as do the Ger
man Fascists.
