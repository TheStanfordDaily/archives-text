# WORK ON PYRE TO BECIN SOON FOR FRESHMEN
## Material To Be Collected This Week; Four Days Set For Building 
### 
Preliminary work on the tradi
j tional Big Game bonfire will be be
gun this week by the men of the
Class of '34, according to Tom Pike,
chairman of the bonfire committee.
Collection of materials is the only
thing on the program for this week
as actual construction will not start
until four days before the rally.
The usual method of construction
will be used this year, with tele
phone poles set in a 40-foot square
as the framework, the committee an
nounces. Ties will be laid in cribs
up each corner to form Hues.
1 Smaller pieces of lumber, boxes, and
trash of all sorts will be used to fill
in this frame.
Old Lumber Wanted
John Logan, chairman of the com
mittee on materials, requests anyone
having old lumber which he will
donate to the pyre to send him word
at Encina Hall.
Benita Nobs, head of the com
missary committee, will direct the
freshman women in providing food
in the shape of coffee and dough
nuts for the workers during the
night shifts in the final period of
construction.
Work on the fire is being begun
earlier than usual, because the bon
fire committee, composed of Pike,
Dick Oddie, and Phil' Caldwell, be
lieves that the small size of the
freshman class will necessitate a
longer period to raise the pile.
Freshmen Responsible
According to the committee, the
success of this year's bonfire depends
entirely on the energy which the
freshmen show in getting out and
helping every spare minute of the
time. Last year, it is declared, the
class was so apathetic that the ad
visability of continuing the tradi
tion was seriously questioned.
Last year's bonfire reached a
height of 65 feet, and it is expected
# that the men of '34 will have diffi-
I culty in equalling that structure on
account of the smaller size of their
class.

Freshmen Responsible
According to the committee, the
success of this year's bonfire depends
entirely on the energy which the
freshmen show in getting out and
helping every spare minute of the
time. Last year, it is declared, the
class was so apathetic that the ad
visability of continuing the tradi
tion was seriously questioned.
Last year's bonfire reached a
height of 65 feet, and it is expected
# that the men of '34 will have diffi-
I culty in equalling that structure on
account of the smaller size of their
class.
