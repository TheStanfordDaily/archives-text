TOKYO, Nov. 9. (/P) â€”Rengo News
Agency dispatches from Taihoku,
capital of the Island of Formosa,
said the bodies of twenty-three sav
ages, including two chieftains, were
found hanging in trees north of the
native viilage of Mahebo.
Apparently the savages had killed
themselves following the taking of
their village by Japanese soldiers
and police recently in a drive
against a native uprising.
