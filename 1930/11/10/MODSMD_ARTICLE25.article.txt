# Warner Says S.C. Has Great Eleven, Cardinals Improved
## Old Fox Reviews Gridiron Events of Past Week-End; Considers Notre Dame, Northwestern Good; Fordham May lake St. Mary's 
### LEN KULLMANN 
"U.S.C. proved by her defeat of California last Saturday that she lias
one of the greatest teams in her history—one of the greatest teams ever
seen on the Coast. By the Trojans' showing against us and against
California, they more than made up for the defeat handed them by

Washington State," and Pop Warner ex
haled a cloud of cigarette smoke and
leaned back in an easy chair in his study.
Sunday evening found the Cardinal
football mentor in a genial frame of mind.
"I was pleased by the improvement our
team showed against Washington,"he
continued.
"While not as good an outfit as last
year's, if the boys continue to improve as
they have, they will be more than satis
factory.
"The work of the line was much better
against Washington than against the Tro
jans, and J think that some of the sub
stitutes showed to better advantage than
the men they replaced."
Warner was particularly pleased with
the work of Don Tyler at end. Playing his
first game, the basketball star showed

plenty of fire, and will he used again in the future. Washington, accord
ing to the Old Fox, did not seem to come up to the standard set by
Bagshaw-coached teams in the past. In fact, Pop pointed out that it was

the most decisive defeat handed the
Huskies since he had come to Stan
ford.
"Notre Dame has a great team—
those backs are better than the
Four Horsemen, and with a heavy
line cleaning up in advance, they
certainly pile up the yardage. And
Northwestern has a good outfit.
Dick Hanley's boys have been going
well this season." Pop reached for
another cigarette, and continued his
talk on Saturday's games.
"Dartmouth has a great team too
—looks like they are one of the best
in the East. Colgate certainly swept
through Columbia Saturday—and
Columbia had just beaten Cornell,
too." Warner sighed at the down
fall of Cornell, but continued:
"Fordham and Army are doing well
—wouldn't be surprised if Fordham
beat St. Mary's, since the Western
team has not shown much of an
offense.
"I received lots of letters after the
U.S.C. game." Pop grinned hugely
at the recollection this brought. "I
read one of them to the team; here's
another. This man is an old rancher
—never heard of the town he's writ
ing from—and he says he never saw
a football game. 'You'd better de
vote lots of study to the game now,'
lie says. Well, maybe I'd better
watch Knute Rockne."

stitutes showed to better advantage than
the men they replaced."
Warner was particularly pleased with
the work of Don Tyler at end. Playing his
first game, the basketball star showed

plenty of fire, and will he used again in the future. Washington, accord
ing to the Old Fox, did not seem to come up to the standard set by
Bagshaw-coached teams in the past. In fact, Pop pointed out that it was

the most decisive defeat handed the
Huskies since he had come to Stan
ford.
"Notre Dame has a great team—
those backs are better than the
Four Horsemen, and with a heavy
line cleaning up in advance, they
certainly pile up the yardage. And
Northwestern has a good outfit.
Dick Hanley's boys have been going
well this season." Pop reached for
another cigarette, and continued his
talk on Saturday's games.
"Dartmouth has a great team too
—looks like they are one of the best
in the East. Colgate certainly swept
through Columbia Saturday—and
Columbia had just beaten Cornell,
too." Warner sighed at the down
fall of Cornell, but continued:
"Fordham and Army are doing well
—wouldn't be surprised if Fordham
beat St. Mary's, since the Western
team has not shown much of an
offense.
"I received lots of letters after the
U.S.C. game." Pop grinned hugely
at the recollection this brought. "I
read one of them to the team; here's
another. This man is an old rancher
—never heard of the town he's writ
ing from—and he says he never saw
a football game. 'You'd better de
vote lots of study to the game now,'
lie says. Well, maybe I'd better
watch Knute Rockne."

"U.S.C. proved by her defeat of California last Saturday that she lias
one of the greatest teams in her history—one of the greatest teams ever
seen on the Coast. By the Trojans' showing against us and against
California, they more than made up for the defeat handed them by

Washington State," and Pop Warner ex
haled a cloud of cigarette smoke and
leaned back in an easy chair in his study.
Sunday evening found the Cardinal
football mentor in a genial frame of mind.
"I was pleased by the improvement our
team showed against Washington,"he
continued.
"While not as good an outfit as last
year's, if the boys continue to improve as
they have, they will be more than satis
factory.
"The work of the line was much better
against Washington than against the Tro
jans, and J think that some of the sub
