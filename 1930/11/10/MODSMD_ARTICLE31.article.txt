# CARD SQUAD WINS EASY 1-0 VICTORY OVER LEGIONNAIRES
## 
### 
With the object of keeping in
competitive shape for California, the
Stanford soccer team took on the
Falo Alto American Legion team
Saturday afternoon just before the
Card-Washington football tilt in a
practice game, and emerged on the
long end of a 1-0 score.
Stanford scored in the first 15
minutes of play, and that tally
proved to be all that was necessary
to win. A factor which kept the
score down was that Coach Ward
Smith used every man on the bench
during the game.
Only 10 Legionnaires showed up
on the field, so Meiggs, one of the
Redshirt reserves, went in for the
Palo Alto team at center forward.
The game started late, so one 40-
minute period was played.
