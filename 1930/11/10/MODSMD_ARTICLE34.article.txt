# HUSKY ELEVEN FADES BEFORE CARD MACHINE
## Line Charge, Aerial Game Big Factors In 25-7 Stanford Victory MOFFATT OUTSTANDING 
### 
While the self-styled Golden
Tornado from Washington died
down to a mere whisper, a charging,
passing Stanford varsity breezed
through to a 25-7 triumph at their
expense Saturday in the Stanford
Stadium while approximately 20.001)
fans sat through a short shower to
see the Cardinal's first power dis
play of the 1930 season.
A charging Stanford line plu; a
perfect aerial attack proved to l><-
the spark plugs which motored the
Big Red Machine down the field to
four touchdowns and one conversion,
and held the Washington Huskies to
a lone scorc achieved in the early
minutes of play.
Huskies Scorc First
Phelan's men drew first blood.
After Bogue's long kick-off put the
Huskies on their 20-yard line, Huf
ford reeled off two first downs be
fore the Huskies kicked. A bad
pass from center cost the Redshirts
8 yards, and after an exchange of
kicks a Washington punt was
downed on the Cards' 1-yard line.
Moffatt punted, and from the
Redshirts' 36-yard line, the Huskies
moved in. A first down on the 26-
yard line, and a 25-yard pass from
Hufford to Lcnfesty who fell over
the goal line, gave the Huskies their
score. Marshall added the extra point
to make it Washington 7, Stanford 0.
Card Passes Score
Coming back with a display of
Warner power, the Cards pushed
over three touchdowns before the
half. From their own 41-yard line,
the boys in red marched to the goal.
A 22-yard toss from Simkins to Mof
fatt put the ball on the Washington
36, and with Caglieri bearing th"
brunt of the attack, the Cards went
to the 11-yard marker. There a
penalty of 5 yards for heckling, ami
a reverse to Caglieri took the pig
skin into scoring territory.
Two beautifully executed for
ward-and-lateral passes produced
12 points in the second quarter. Fol
lowing Moffatt's dashing punt return
to the Washington 20, a forward
pass from Simkins to Neill was
lateraled to Moffatt near the side
lines and the stellar left halfback
ambled over for six points.
42 Yards to Touchdown
Shortly before the half ended,
Stanford struck from 42 yards out.
After Moffatt had signalled for a
fair catch of Marsh's punt on the
Huskies' 47, another forward and
lateral did the trick. Simkins tossed
to Kay Albertson for an eight-yard
advance, and just as the tall end
was tackled, he flipped the ball to
Caddel who sprinted down the side
lines to the end zone. Albertson's
cool work in handling the ball was
responsible for the success of the
play.
Colvin scored the Cards' final
touchdown in the third period. Fol
lowing Rintala's punt return which
put the oval on Washington's 41-
yard line, a pass from Rintala to
Rothert moved the Redshirts to
Washington's 26-yard stripe. A toss
from Rothert to Caddel gained 9,
and Hillman made it first down 16
yards from the end zone.
Rothert Converts
Rintala's heave to Colvin in (he
corner of scoring territory put the
pigskin over, and this time Rothert
added the extra point to make the
final count Stanford 25, Washington
7.
Except for their first burst in the
opening period of play, the Golden
Tornado never threatened. Hufford,
although the outstanding Washing
ton back, was in no way comparable'
lo Stanford's Moflatt. Buse, the re
maining Husky threat, never became
dangerous.
Card Forwards Powerful
Consistently getting the jump on
their opponents, the Cardinal for
ward wall out-powered Washington.
Bardin, Hulen, Hunt, an® Heiser all
showed well at guard, Ehrhorn, al
though overshadowed by Bogue's
work, turned in a respectable game
at tackle, and the success of the
passing attack speaks well for the
play of the ends. As is usual when
the line opens up holes, all of the
backs went well. Caglieri, Caddel,
and Rintala came through, as did
Hillman and Simkins, but the play
of Rothert and Moffatt was out
standing.
Rothert's high and fancy kicking
perpetually kept the Huskies in a
hole, while Moffatt's general all
round play needs no comment.
Never appearing to exert himself,
"Flashy Phil" is always lugging that
ball toward the other team's goal by
the most direct route. Rothert, who
does all the jobs lying around loose,
showed his worth no matter from
what position he took the ball.
The Redshirts came through the
battle comparatively unscathed.
Nothing but bumps and bruises to
day remind the squad of the game,
so the war cry is "Now bring on
Cal Tech."

Pink snow in the Olympic moun
tains of Washington is explained by
the presence of minute cell life.

fore the Huskies kicked. A bad
pass from center cost the Redshirts
8 yards, and after an exchange of
kicks a Washington punt was
downed on the Cards' 1-yard line.
Moffatt punted, and from the
Redshirts' 36-yard line, the Huskies
moved in. A first down on the 26-
yard line, and a 25-yard pass from
Hufford to Lcnfesty who fell over
the goal line, gave the Huskies their
score. Marshall added the extra point
to make it Washington 7, Stanford 0.
Card Passes Score
Coming back with a display of
Warner power, the Cards pushed
over three touchdowns before the
half. From their own 41-yard line,
the boys in red marched to the goal.
A 22-yard toss from Simkins to Mof
fatt put the ball on the Washington
36, and with Caglieri bearing th"
brunt of the attack, the Cards went
to the 11-yard marker. There a
penalty of 5 yards for heckling, ami
a reverse to Caglieri took the pig
skin into scoring territory.
Two beautifully executed for
ward-and-lateral passes produced
12 points in the second quarter. Fol
lowing Moffatt's dashing punt return
to the Washington 20, a forward
pass from Simkins to Neill was
lateraled to Moffatt near the side
lines and the stellar left halfback
ambled over for six points.
42 Yards to Touchdown
Shortly before the half ended,
Stanford struck from 42 yards out.
After Moffatt had signalled for a
fair catch of Marsh's punt on the
Huskies' 47, another forward and
lateral did the trick. Simkins tossed
to Kay Albertson for an eight-yard
advance, and just as the tall end
was tackled, he flipped the ball to
Caddel who sprinted down the side
lines to the end zone. Albertson's
cool work in handling the ball was
responsible for the success of the
play.
Colvin scored the Cards' final
touchdown in the third period. Fol
lowing Rintala's punt return which
put the oval on Washington's 41-
yard line, a pass from Rintala to
Rothert moved the Redshirts to
Washington's 26-yard stripe. A toss
from Rothert to Caddel gained 9,
and Hillman made it first down 16
yards from the end zone.
Rothert Converts
Rintala's heave to Colvin in (he
corner of scoring territory put the
pigskin over, and this time Rothert
added the extra point to make the
final count Stanford 25, Washington
7.
Except for their first burst in the
opening period of play, the Golden
Tornado never threatened. Hufford,
although the outstanding Washing
ton back, was in no way comparable'
lo Stanford's Moflatt. Buse, the re
maining Husky threat, never became
dangerous.
Card Forwards Powerful
Consistently getting the jump on
their opponents, the Cardinal for
ward wall out-powered Washington.
Bardin, Hulen, Hunt, an® Heiser all
showed well at guard, Ehrhorn, al
though overshadowed by Bogue's
work, turned in a respectable game
at tackle, and the success of the
passing attack speaks well for the
play of the ends. As is usual when
the line opens up holes, all of the
backs went well. Caglieri, Caddel,
and Rintala came through, as did
Hillman and Simkins, but the play
of Rothert and Moffatt was out
standing.
Rothert's high and fancy kicking
perpetually kept the Huskies in a
hole, while Moffatt's general all
round play needs no comment.
Never appearing to exert himself,
"Flashy Phil" is always lugging that
ball toward the other team's goal by
the most direct route. Rothert, who
does all the jobs lying around loose,
showed his worth no matter from
what position he took the ball.
The Redshirts came through the
battle comparatively unscathed.
Nothing but bumps and bruises to
day remind the squad of the game,
so the war cry is "Now bring on
Cal Tech."

Pink snow in the Olympic moun
tains of Washington is explained by
the presence of minute cell life.
While the self-styled Golden
Tornado from Washington died

brunt of the attack, the Cards went
to the 11-yard marker. There a
penalty of 5 yards for heckling, ami
a reverse to Caglieri took the pig
skin into scoring territory.
Two beautifully executed for
ward-and-lateral passes produced
12 points in the second quarter. Fol
lowing Moffatt's dashing punt return
to the Washington 20, a forward
pass from Simkins to Neill was
lateraled to Moffatt near the side
lines and the stellar left halfback
ambled over for six points.
42 Yards to Touchdown
Shortly before the half ended,
Stanford struck from 42 yards out.
After Moffatt had signalled for a
fair catch of Marsh's punt on the
Huskies' 47, another forward and
lateral did the trick. Simkins tossed
to Kay Albertson for an eight-yard
advance, and just as the tall end
was tackled, he flipped the ball to
Caddel who sprinted down the side
lines to the end zone. Albertson's
cool work in handling the ball was
responsible for the success of the
play.
Colvin scored the Cards' final
touchdown in the third period. Fol
lowing Rintala's punt return which
put the oval on Washington's 41-
yard line, a pass from Rintala to
Rothert moved the Redshirts to
Washington's 26-yard stripe. A toss
from Rothert to Caddel gained 9,
and Hillman made it first down 16
yards from the end zone.
Rothert Converts
Rintala's heave to Colvin in (he
corner of scoring territory put the
pigskin over, and this time Rothert
added the extra point to make the
final count Stanford 25, Washington
7.
Except for their first burst in the
opening period of play, the Golden
Tornado never threatened. Hufford,
although the outstanding Washing
ton back, was in no way comparable'
lo Stanford's Moflatt. Buse, the re
maining Husky threat, never became
dangerous.
Card Forwards Powerful
Consistently getting the jump on
their opponents, the Cardinal for
ward wall out-powered Washington.
Bardin, Hulen, Hunt, an® Heiser all
showed well at guard, Ehrhorn, al
though overshadowed by Bogue's
work, turned in a respectable game
at tackle, and the success of the
passing attack speaks well for the
play of the ends. As is usual when
the line opens up holes, all of the
backs went well. Caglieri, Caddel,
and Rintala came through, as did
Hillman and Simkins, but the play
of Rothert and Moffatt was out
standing.
Rothert's high and fancy kicking
perpetually kept the Huskies in a
hole, while Moffatt's general all
round play needs no comment.
Never appearing to exert himself,
"Flashy Phil" is always lugging that
ball toward the other team's goal by
the most direct route. Rothert, who
does all the jobs lying around loose,
showed his worth no matter from
what position he took the ball.
The Redshirts came through the
battle comparatively unscathed.
Nothing but bumps and bruises to
day remind the squad of the game,
so the war cry is "Now bring on
Cal Tech."

Pink snow in the Olympic moun
tains of Washington is explained by
the presence of minute cell life.
While the self-styled Golden
Tornado from Washington died
down to a mere whisper, a charging,
passing Stanford varsity breezed
through to a 25-7 triumph at their
expense Saturday in the Stanford
Stadium while approximately 20.001)
fans sat through a short shower to
see the Cardinal's first power dis
play of the 1930 season.
A charging Stanford line plu; a
perfect aerial attack proved to l><-
the spark plugs which motored the
Big Red Machine down the field to
four touchdowns and one conversion,
and held the Washington Huskies to
a lone scorc achieved in the early
minutes of play.
Huskies Scorc First
Phelan's men drew first blood.
After Bogue's long kick-off put the
Huskies on their 20-yard line, Huf
ford reeled off two first downs be
fore the Huskies kicked. A bad
pass from center cost the Redshirts
8 yards, and after an exchange of
kicks a Washington punt was
downed on the Cards' 1-yard line.
Moffatt punted, and from the
Redshirts' 36-yard line, the Huskies
moved in. A first down on the 26-
yard line, and a 25-yard pass from
Hufford to Lcnfesty who fell over
the goal line, gave the Huskies their
score. Marshall added the extra point
to make it Washington 7, Stanford 0.
Card Passes Score

Warner power, the Cards pushed
over three touchdowns before the
half. From their own 41-yard line,
the boys in red marched to the goal.
