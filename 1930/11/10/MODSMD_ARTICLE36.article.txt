\\ hen the Stanford varsity ran onto the Stadium gridiron Sat
unlay, ('ardinal rooters cheered; in fact, they yelled, and they con
tinued to cheer and yell until the end of the game. Seemingly, the
more they cheered, the more points the team scored, and the more
points the team scored the more the rooters cheered.
It was rather pleasant to witness, this combination of rooting
and point scoring. Stanford students were hacking a winning team
Saturday, undoubtedly; but they were backing it not onlv in the
latter periods when it was ahead but also during the early minutes
of plav when it was lx-hind.
Maybe it was the rain, maybe it was the golden helmets of
Washington's I luskies, maybe it was the red and white pants of the
< ardinal gridsters that stirred up some genuine enthusiasm in the
rooting section. Whatever it was, it worked.
t ntil Saturday this season's Stanford rooting sections could not
have been accused of over-enthusiasm. I'.ut at the Washington
game the Stanford section really cheered: it gave the team all the
bleacher support in .its power to give. The students sounded as if
tbev wanted the team to win. The rooters did their part : the team
did its.
K'esult—Stanford, 25: Washington, 7.
