# OUSTING THE UNDESIRABLES
## 
### 
P.oard of Athletic Control and Rally Committee officials will
start investigation today of more than one hundred students' names
in the first step toward elimination of non-students from the rooting
sect ion.
Persons who did not appear to be students were requested by
Rally (Committee members to sign their names on slips of cardboard ;
ihese slips and the seat stubs were given to the 15.A.C. representa
tives for checking purposes.
Should the authorities discover that the rooters' tickets were
'•Id by students to outsiders then the I!. \.( . plans to blacklist those
students found guilty of violating the ticket contracts.
I lie investigation on the part of the 11.A.C. and the Rally Com
mittee may mean long hours of hard work. It may seem absurd
and ridiculous to go to such lengths to purge the rooting section of
undesirable characters. It may seem unfair and snobbish on the
] art of the officials to oust non-students from the rooting section.
I>ut the fact remains—the rooting section has to be cleared of
I'.fT'.ons who have no loyalty toward Stanford, and who don't care
\\ hellm there are anv decencies to lie observed in the rooting section.
