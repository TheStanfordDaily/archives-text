STAYING WITH RELATIONS. By |
Hose Macaulay. 11. Liveright,
in. (At llic Palo Alio Book
Shop.)
Catherine Grey was a woman
novelist who "wrote about people." j
She firmly believed that every in
dividual could be classified in a |
rigid type. While visiting her rela- |
tives, she immediately characterized ,
' them as though they were in the I
museum.
Perhaps the weird setting of a j
Mayan jungle had something to do
with it. Anyway, before long all
, Catherine's relatives had precipi
' tated themselves out of their as-
I signed !ypes, and were engaging her
in a varied sort of adventure in- [
volving anything from kidnapping
to pursuing a criminal.
If Miss Macaulay means to be •
satiristic, and humorous, "Staying
With Relations" has its amusing
points, but one sadly fears that she
really was serious in handling her
plot. Dialogue is witty and amusing
enough to imply the former conclu
sion, but the characters themselves
\ are too naively trusting in the things i
! about them lo be the objects of
satire. J. N.
LAUGHTER—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
A Follies beauty, Nancy Carroll, i
marries a public utilities Croesus, j
never realizing that wealth does not j
bring happiness (although she does i
manage to have a pretty good time i
at that) and becomes her husband's j
trademark. However, there is a
1 young composer, Frederick March, '

I who returns from ParijL He knows
I ihat she is unhappy and waits his
chance to prove it to her.
Through her marriage she ac
quires a beautiful stepdaugnter, and
jit becomes her duty to keep the
J young lady away from the city's
| pitfalls. This she does so effectively
that the stepdaughter's lover kills
i himself just as they were about to
j elope. Of course the wife sees then
that love is something serious. She
| goes to Paris with the composer and
discovers that laughter is also a big
fcctor in love.
It sounds simple but some good
, scenes are introduced. Nancy Carroll
is as charming as ever and shows
; that she is capable of more than a
j mere display of beauty. —H. D. M.
I MAYBE IT'S LOVE. At the Varsity
Theatre.
A new college picture with Joan
Bennett as the beautiful president's
daughter—but this is an attempt at
something different. Instead of the
usual roommates, and last-minute
touchdowns, there are genuine foot
i ball men and an amusing story.
"Maybe It's Love" boasts of an
All-American football team and it
I isn't the U.S.C. team, either. War
-1 ner Brothers has imported eleven
; actual grid stars from all over the
i c ountry. The result is interesting,
i While the All-Americans furnish
i the background they are not forced
i to act as well. Joan Bennett, Joe
| Brown with the amazing mouth, and
! James Hall do it for them. Joe is
| always good for lots of laughs, and
Joan is \<ery beautiful. » —N. J.
