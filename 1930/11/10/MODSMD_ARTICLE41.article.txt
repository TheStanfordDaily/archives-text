Washington convinced us of the
value of being silk-shirt minded,
Saturday. Now we're looking for a
hole in everything worthwhile. Their
silk jerseys doubtlessly do cut down
on their weight—but it seems to us
it cuts down on their skin, too.
It's a chance for real, old
fashioned college spirit—(his be
ing able to say truthfully, "I lost
my shirt for my Alma Mater!"
There were almost as many sail
ors and chauffeurs as there were
ham sandwiches, in the Stadium.
Sailors, we suppose, because they're

gentlemen stood at attention when
the yell leader announced, "Stanford

The oratorio class, in a re
cent rehearsal, had been prac
ticing the "Amen" closing till
they were nearly exhausted.

Another weary one: "But these
are hymns, not hers . .»"
It may, and then again it may
not be the fault of Stanford wo
men, that our local Stickey's has
been enlarged to twice its original
size. But the fact remains that some

It was predicted over thirty years
ago that too many attractive women !

other normal college activities." Can
it be that they knew what they were j
talking about? We doubt it . . .
A national swimming supervisor
or Boy Scout or something was
tolking to one of the women's swim
ming classes the other day. "Women
are better swimmers than men," he
said. "Last year, five men
for every one woman who did, in
the United States." "Obvious!" says
we. In summer camps and tanks and
places we've never noticed anyone 1
getting awfully enthusiastic about •
