# Campus Opinion
## FROM NEW YORK, NOT FROM STANFORD 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I correct a statement in Fri
day's issue of The Daily? In the
i editorial on "Building Reputation"
it was stated that "Dr. Karl T.
! Compton . . . broadcasted from
i Stanford the intimate details of the
life of X-ray." The facts are as fol
lows:
Dr. Compton broadcasted from
New York, not from Stanford.
Learning that the broadcast was to
be given the officers of the Stanford
Chapter of Sigma Xi, the scientific
research honor society, decided that
; it would be in keeping with the aims
! of the organization to foster scien
' tific research in every way possible
' to make this lecture and the others
j to follow in this series available to
the Stanford public. The necessary
arrangements were therefore made,
a radio was kindly loaned by the

Varsity Radio Den, and the lecture
was listened to and, we believe, en
: joyed by all who attended.
I might take this opportunity to
mention that if the interest in them
; continues Sigma Xi will make simi
lar arrangements for the other lec
j tures in the series. The second will
be on next Wednesday at 4:15
(/clock (lasting for 15 minutes), j
1 again in Room .170, the main physics
j lecture room. The speaker will be
, Dr. A. F. Woods of the U.S. Depart- j
ment of Agriculture. The subject of
| his talk is not yet known to the
writer; it will, however, be an-
I nounced in The Daily later. Suc
j ceeding lectures will probably come
;;l the same time each week.
Very truly yours,
Maurice L. Huggins
Secretary, Stanford Chapter,
Society of the Sigma Xi
