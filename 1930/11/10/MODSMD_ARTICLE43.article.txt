At California a plan has been de
vised whereby iron may be given
to anaemic trees. Of more value at
the present time would be a dis
covery whereby starch might be in
jected into football players.
And talking about California and
football reminds one of the old prov
erb that "He who laughs last, laughs
best."
A mustache contest al Occi
dental College will be judged
by three co-eds. One wonders
what will be the criterions used
in the competition. Size? Beau
ty? Comfort? Or the tickling
possibilities of the mustache?
A plan has been adopted at Smith
College that permits better students
to cut classes. The plan is not feas
ible because it would surely result
in the professor lecturing to him
self, as poor students cut. under any
policy and under the new system the
"phi betes" would likewise be ab
sent.
A study just completed at Wash
ington State College reveals that
Cleopatra, Delilah, and the Helen,
whose face launched a thousand
ships, did not wear stockings. The
modern co-ed, however, need not
think that she can succeed by also
going bare-legged.
These ancient sirens did not
have to contend with modern

competition; and (lie keenness
of modern competition demands
the acceptance of, the psycho
logical principle that what we
don't see is more interesting
than what we do see.
What is more—the modern college
man is more aesthetic than Anthony j
of Rome, Samson of Jerusalem, or
Paris of Troy; and the least aesthetic ,
thing in all the modern world is a
pair of bare red legs.
The attack on the "credit system"
in college by the president of Notre
| Dame is hardly noticed; but an at
! tack on the "Rockne Shift" sets a
nation agog.
Nevertheless we have estab
lished a polytheism in modern
colleges and the gods are the '
number of units we must secure
before graduation. On their al
tar we have sacrificed a true
education.
Yet America turns out the most
' eollegc students and the greatest
number of automobiles of any coun
try in the entire world.
