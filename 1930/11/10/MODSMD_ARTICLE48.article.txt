## 
### 
PULLMAN, Wash., Nov. 9.â€”The
wildest dreams of little Joe Rash
kov, a football-minded youngster
from Spokane, have come true.
Chatting familiarly with the vic
torious Cougars, he returned home
yesterday from Moscow where he
had done his bit in Washington
State's victory over Idaho Univer
sity.
The young grid aspirant had long
nursed a secret ambition to be water
boy for the Cougars, and in a burst
of daring one day he wrote "Babe"
Holllngbery, Washington State
coach, requesting the honor:
My friend coach:
I have allways wanted to write
this letter and at last I have. I have
heard of the game coming Saturday,
j so I thought I would ask you if I
i could be water boy. 1 have lots of
I guts and can cheer up hurt players
! and J have allways wanted to see
your he-man players.
Beside that I play football too.
Are team is called the Jeruslam
Tigers. We beat to teams so far by
scores of 0-0 and 18-0 hows that he
i man Hollinbery. If you answer me
: and tell me if I can be water boy,
i ii you answer me it will be the best
thing that ever happened.
If you let me be water boy you
can depend on me to encourage the
players.
Please answer me Hollinbery old
man. Your friend,
Joe Rashkov.
He got the job.
