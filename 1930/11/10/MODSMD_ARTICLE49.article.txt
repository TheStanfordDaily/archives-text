When H. Dixon Bogue hit his first

a waiting world that he was
>out to play his first real game of
e season. Starting by lifting the
otball well into the end-zone for
e longest kick-off the Cards have
ade in many a moon, Bogue
uyed the type of football he is
pable of.

ashinglon. Completing 10 out of
attempts, the Cards chalked up

Ridden unmercifully all week at
actice by his teammates, the bulky
ckle came up in the middle of
cry play aimed at his side of the
it?. lii order to insure the repeti
•ii of his play against California
d Dartmouth, the student body
ould equip I'llil Moit'aU with a
! of nice, sharp spurs.
Stanford's aerial attack functioned
e nobody's business against
ashinglon. Completing 10 out of
attempts, the Cards chalked up
"j yards and 8 first downs with
'•ir pass plays. '
Harlow Rothcrt provetl conclu
,'ely that lie is the coast's best
liter Saturday. High and far did
nlow's boots travel; one going
or the goal line from a scrimmage
ie on tli«' Stanford 45-yard marker,
other titanic effort travelled from
c Stanford 15- to the Washington
and the run-back put the oval
the Huskies' 2!)-yard stripe.
Rill Marks, replacing Perry Tay
• in the last few minutes of the
si half, displayed a neat defensive
me in the remaining period. Knif
through the Husky line on more
an one occasion to throw gold
id backs for losses, Marks looked
eel to the anxious eyes of War
r, who showed his perturbation
ion Taylor left the game.
Harry Hilhnan. although not given
ah of an opportunity to carry the
11, turned in his dependable game
hacking up (lie line. While not as
ectacular as the dashing Flcish
ckcr was last year, Hilhnan hits
s men when they poke through
c Stanford forward wall.

Tom Lambert, just a rough, tough
lfback, although only in the game
r the final period of play, stamped
•; image on the memory of all who
w the game. Making a couple of
lg-around-the-rosie tackles, in
cepting a pass, and in general
splaying a world of fight and
ive, Lambert will make it hard
r both Cad del and Caglieri to keep ,
m on the bench.

More than any other one factor,
e passing of Billy Simkins motored
e Card offense down the field time
ler time. Those forwards and lat- !
;i!s which must have broken Jim
io Phelan's heart all started with
perfect toss from Simkins. On all
t one play, when signals evidently
•nt hay-wire, the Manhattan
•ach boy shone.
'Gob" Wcniworth and tackle
hwegler proved to be the main j
>s in the Stanford ointment. While
a unit the Washington line was
t played, the defensive work this i
0 showed makes them a pair of |
it ball players calculated to glad
n the heart of any football men-
Onee again the Redshirts lost
>rc ground than their opponents
rough penalties. Exactly 70 yards
•re they lined for transgression of !
• rules, while the Huskies were
bited a trifling 10 yards for two
ors. To date, the Cards have been
nali/.ed on an average of two
Ids to their opponents' one.
Over at Berkeley, the Daily Cali
nian derived considerable amuse- j
•nt from the Cardinal downfall at
_• hands of U.S.C. We are genu
•ly sorry that the Bears were
unced so badly last Saturday, but
• cannot wait to see what the j
.{an of the A.S.U.C. has to say
tut THAT slaughter. —L. K., Jr.
