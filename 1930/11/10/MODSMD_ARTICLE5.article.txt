# War Mothers Benefited By European Trip
## War Department Planning Trips For Remaining 13,000 Mothers 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. !). UV) — A
peace they have not known since
the World War will mark this
Armistice Day for 3600 American
mothers and widows who were
members of the Government's first
pilgrimage of Gold Star Mothers to
cemeteries of France.
With scarcely an exception the
women have written to the War De
partment expressing gratitude for
the peace that has come to them
since they knelt by the white crosses
overseas.
Mothers Encouragcd
Encouraged by the beneficial re
action of the women who made this
first journey, the War Department
is going ahead with plans for next
year's pilgrimage.
About 30,000 women are expected
to visit the European cemeteries
next summer, and the remainder of
the 13,000 entitled to go will be
taken in 1932 and 1933.
War Department officials say the
first pilgrimage has justified fully
the expenditure of money, due to
the beneficial reaction.
Contrary to the misgivings of
some officials that hysteria would
mar the journey, such manifesta
tions almost were entirely lacking.
Few Break Down
Quiet tears were shed at the neat
ly kept graves, but with them, the
women say, there came a peace and
resignation they had not felt before.
Army officers who made the trip
acclaim the women "real soldiers"
for the fortitude and self-control
they exhibited.
