pass was intercepted. It was at this
point that Nichols made his long
run to score.

Hillman.

mud-covered, tired Cardinals came
late in the fourth quarter when

was 13 to 0.
Outweighing the Cards by 12
pounds to the man in the line, the
more beefy Bear Cubs were favored
by the weather which had made
line plunging the only sure of
fensive weapon. The passing attack
of the Stanford yearlings which has
kept opposing teams worried
throughout the season could not lie
used safely in this all-important
tussle climaxing the year for both
teams.
Long Runs Score
Though the Redshirts were on the
defensive a good part of the time
due to the line plunging ability of
the Bears, it was not through this
medium that the U.C. freshmen
scored the winning tallies. Both of
the counters were made on runs
over half the length of the field, one
of them a 75-yard» gallop by Hill—
blom, who intercepted a Card pass
on his own 15-yard lino.
The other California score came
when Nichols, a substitute half, ran
through a wide hole at left tackle
opened by the heavy Bear linesmen
and ran unmolested 55 yards for a
touchdown.
Cards Threaten
The Stanford babes ihreatened
the Blue and Gold goal line several
times during the last half, but were
helpless when in scoring territory
without confidence in their aerial
game .
Late in the third quarter Brad
shaw's warriors seemed to be hit
ting their stride, starting from their
own 40-yard line and making two
first downs to go into U.C. territory.
Anderson tore off 15 yards around
left end, but on the. next play his
pass was intercepted. It was at this
point that Nichols made his long
run to score.
In the same period the Redshirt
babes threatened twice more, only to
lose out within scoring distance
when passes by Maentz and Ander
son were intercepted. One of these
was from the U.C. nine-yard mark,
which the Cards had reached
through the stellar line plunging of
Hillman.
Final Effort Fails
The last scoring chance of the
mud-covered, tired Cardinals came
late in the fourth quarter when
Spencer made a beautiful run
around left end to advance the ball
20 yards to his own 45-yard line.
Here a pass, Anderson to Monsalve,
put it on the U.C. 25-yard marker,
and it looked like the Card babes
would score.

derson passed and the slippery ball
fell into the arms of Hillblom, who
ran the entire 75 yards untouched
