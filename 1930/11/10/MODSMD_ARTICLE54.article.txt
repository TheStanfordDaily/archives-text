# MATCHES TO START IN ALL-UNIVERSITY GOLF TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
With first round matches starting
today, keen competition looms for
the all-University golf tournament
being sponsored by the junior class.
Among the 48 men who qualified
last week appear names of some of
the leading divot diggers on the
Farm. This does not necessarily
mean that these stellar players are
' going to have an easy time of it,
since the tourney is a handicap af
fair.
j An idea of what the par shooters
will be up against is plain in the
case of the first round match slated
| between Herman Hellman and
! David Cohn.
Hellman, number four man on the
I Card varsity squad, plays to a five
| handicap, while Cohn's handicap is
listed as 27. Thus the star player
will have to give his opponent, who
qualified with a 93, eleven strokes
on the 18 holes.
Later rounds in the tourney
should furnish some close matches
with near-par golf on the program.
MacNaughton, Eichelberger, and
Edmonds, first three men on the
â–  Card varsity team, who qualified
with gross scores of 74, 73, and 72,
respectively, may clash in some
stellar divot digging if they can get
past the high-handicap men to be
encountered in the early rounds.
Pairings for the first round, which
are posted in the golf shop, must be
completed by Tuesday night, ac
cording to Don Slocum, in charge of
the tourney.
