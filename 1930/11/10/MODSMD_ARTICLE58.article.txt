# BREAKERS DEFEAT K.A.'S TO PLACE IN GOLF TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
j It took six extra holes and two
! days of play to decide that Breakers
i and not Kappa Alpha would enter
I the semi-final round of the intra
i mural golf tournament in progress
i last week at the Stanford course.
! Staging a "Garrison finish," Kappa
! Alpha's twosome, Thompson and
! Davis, who were four down at the
I end of the first nine and dormie
j two at the seventeenth green,
i squared the match with Brown and
; Heinecke of Breakers on the home
green.
i Four extra holes failed to break
i the deadlock before darkness forced
! a postponement of play. Halving of
! the twenty-third hole signalized the
| resumption of hostilities in the
morning, but Brown of Breakers
| came through with a par four on
! the next green to end the marathon.
In the other quarter final matches
' Delta Chi won from the Phi Delts
i two up and one to play; Theta Chi
! beat the Chi Psi's four and three,
j and Delta Upsilon edged out the

Betas two and one.
Breakers met the D.U.'s in a 36-
hole semi-final match last Saturday,
losing a dingdong battle by one hole.
The winner of the Theta Chi-Delta
Chi match will meet the D.U.'s for
the championship sometime this
week.
