# FOG, WIND BRING BAD LUCK TO SIX SHIPS OFF COAST
## Eighteen Lives Lost When Lumber Schooner Is Broken In Two 
### 
Bad joss rode down the Pacific J
Coast on wind and fog, bringing
death to 18 men, disaster to three
ships and threatening three others
during the last seven days.
The lives were lost when the lit- j
tie lumber schooner Brooklyn was j
upset by mountainous waves and !
broken in two as she tried to cross
treacherous Humboldt Bar in north- ;
ern California in the face of a heavy |
gale late yesterday. Witnesses said ;
she went down quickly with all J
hands aboard.
The final chapter remained to be j
written for two others caught in j
gales or fog. The rusted old hulk of
the once-proud cruiser Missoula, J
former speedy fighting craft of the j
American navy, with eleven men
aboard was tossed by heavy swells j
off the Oregon coast after she ;
snapped a towline to the equally j
historic tug Roosevelt. The Coast I
Guard cutter Saranac guarded the j
helpless craft with a new line aboard j
her.
Pinioned to Pescadero Reef by a !
jagged rock which protruded eight j
feet into her hold, the oil tanker j
Tamiahua was a victim of dense |
fog and a treacherous coast. When !
attempts to refloat her failed the
Coas Guard rigged up a breeches â– 
buoy to take of? her crew of 39 '
which had Remained board since J
she grounded Thursday night, 50
miles south of San Francisco.
