## 
### 
NORMAN, Ok la., Nov. 9. (A>)â€”
Approving the stand taken by Dean
S. W. Reaves, Oklahoma faculty
representative at a Big Six meeting
a week ago, the University of Okla
homa athletic council today had
decided to cancel its 1931 home
coming football game here with
Kansas University, next November.
The council was not severing con
nections with the Kansas school, its
members pointed out, but is sup
porting Dean Reaves and seeking to
have Kansas comply strictly with
Big Six standards.
Reaves said Kansas had not been
suspended from the Conference, but
had been instructed to co-operate
with Big Six officials to prevent
subsidizing in the future.
