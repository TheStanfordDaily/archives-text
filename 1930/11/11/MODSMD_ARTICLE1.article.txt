### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 10.—(PIP) —University of California students, smart
ing from the 74-to-0 drubbing given the Golden Bears by the U.S.C.
Trojans last Saturday, awoke this morning to find themselves in the midst
of an embarrassing situation brought about by the publication of an
editorial in The Daily Californian criticizing the low status of the gridiron
sport at the local institution. The editorial, assumed to have been written
by Arthur Arlett ,editor, revived every rumor and report that has been
bruited about the campus for ~~~ "

past several years.
in il The Daily Californian asked
a series of questions which indicated
that it was dissatisfied with the re
sults achieved by Coach Clarence
M. "Nibs" Price.
Implies Price Ouster
While not coming out flatfooted
with a demand that Price produce
01 resign, the editorial did lay itself
open to such an interpretation. Spe
cifically, it sought the answer to
questions like these: "Does Califor
nia have a competent coaching staff?
I:; the material equal to that avail
able at other colleges? Must we have
subsidization if necessary?"
Price refused to comment on the
editorial, other than to say he would
not resign his post.
The editorial, with the heading,
"While we celebrate Armistice Day
of peace, we foresee an athletic
war,"' follows:
"Piled high about the ghostly
figures of 71 10 0 lies the wreck
age of California's football as
pirations. The hope of students,
the faith of alumni, and the
work of coach and players have
all been exploded at once, and
the task of reconstruction is im
mediate and immense.
"Buried as most of the details of
this catastrophe are, there is one
fact that stands out above all others.
Whenever the task is begun, and
whatever is accomplished, the job
must be started and finished here
at. home. There is a mighty legion
of disappointed alumni who would
like to assume command; there is a
shrewd body of newspaper sports
writers who will fill their columns
with a variety of solutions to all
our problems.
"Something the Matter"
"But on the campus are the peo
ple whose team it really is, and the
steps to be taken should be taken
by them.
"Just what they must do is
problematical. Bewildered by
such a crushing defeat, their
course for the next few days is
indefinite. But when they do
begin to act, they will have to
be thorough. There will be more
to look into than just the loss
of one name or a few games;
there will be the whole problem
of what is the matter with Cali
fornia athletic activities. Cer
tainly something is the matter,
and neither alumni nor sports
writers can fix it.
"Some of the many aspects of the
situation we take the liberty of sug
gesting:
"Competent StalT?"
"1 -Does California have a compe
tent coaching staff'.' Does the head
coach, though being a Californian,
;i good sport, and a formerly suc
cessful assistant coach, justify the
payment of a* large salary, or
should the Associated Students
hire a good sport who has been a
: uccessful head coach, regardless
of his alumnus affiliations? Is the
salary paid because of the school
attendance or the job to be filled?
