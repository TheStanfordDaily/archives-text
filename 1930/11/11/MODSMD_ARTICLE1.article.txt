## Questions Asked in Editorial Indicate Dissatisfaction With Low Status of Gridiron Sport Under Present Coaching Staff PRICE REFUSES TO RESIGN; IGNORES PAPER 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 10.—(PIP) —University of California students, smart
ing from the 74-to-0 drubbing given the Golden Bears by the U.S.C.
Trojans last Saturday, awoke this morning to find themselves in the midst
of an embarrassing situation brought about by the publication of an
editorial in The Daily Californian criticizing the low status of the gridiron
sport at the local institution. The editorial, assumed to have been written
by Arthur Arlett ,editor, revived every rumor and report that has been
bruited about the campus for ~~~ "

past several years.
in il The Daily Californian asked
a series of questions which indicated
that it was dissatisfied with the re
sults achieved by Coach Clarence
M. "Nibs" Price.
Implies Price Ouster
While not coming out flatfooted
with a demand that Price produce
01 resign, the editorial did lay itself
open to such an interpretation. Spe
cifically, it sought the answer to
questions like these: "Does Califor
nia have a competent coaching staff?
I:; the material equal to that avail
able at other colleges? Must we have
subsidization if necessary?"
Price refused to comment on the
editorial, other than to say he would
not resign his post.
The editorial, with the heading,
"While we celebrate Armistice Day
of peace, we foresee an athletic
war,"' follows:
"Piled high about the ghostly
figures of 71 10 0 lies the wreck
age of California's football as
pirations. The hope of students,
the faith of alumni, and the
work of coach and players have
all been exploded at once, and
the task of reconstruction is im
mediate and immense.
"Buried as most of the details of
this catastrophe are, there is one
fact that stands out above all others.
Whenever the task is begun, and
whatever is accomplished, the job
must be started and finished here
at. home. There is a mighty legion
of disappointed alumni who would
like to assume command; there is a
shrewd body of newspaper sports
writers who will fill their columns
with a variety of solutions to all
our problems.
"Something the Matter"
"But on the campus are the peo
ple whose team it really is, and the
steps to be taken should be taken
by them.
"Just what they must do is
problematical. Bewildered by
such a crushing defeat, their
course for the next few days is
indefinite. But when they do
begin to act, they will have to
be thorough. There will be more
to look into than just the loss
of one name or a few games;
there will be the whole problem
of what is the matter with Cali
fornia athletic activities. Cer
tainly something is the matter,
and neither alumni nor sports
writers can fix it.
"Some of the many aspects of the
situation we take the liberty of sug
gesting:
"Competent StalT?"
"1 -Does California have a compe
tent coaching staff'.' Does the head
coach, though being a Californian,
;i good sport, and a formerly suc
cessful assistant coach, justify the
payment of a* large salary, or
should the Associated Students
hire a good sport who has been a
: uccessful head coach, regardless
of his alumnus affiliations? Is the
salary paid because of the school
attendance or the job to be filled?
"2—lf California were to hire
someone else as coach, would
he be able to do any better
with the material at hand?
Would he be faced with ex
actly the same prospects of
lean years as the alumni
coach?
"3—ls a proportionate amount of
material coming to California? If
there is a lack of it in an institu
tion of this size, what is the rea
son? Should we begin to subsidize
in an effort to get back our pin
nacle position, or should we go
after those who now subsidize?
"Who- Subsidizes?"
'"4—As a matter of fact, who does
subsidize? Who can find out who
subsidizes? And, having found
out, who has the spirit and the
courage to say so in open meet
ing?
"s—ls California adequately repre
sented at the Pacific Coast Con
ference? Has California been such
a good sport and high principled
college that her representatives
have taken a defeatist attitude to
ward the possibility of cleaning
up other colleges? Is young blood
necessary, perhaps, to force the
hand of schools whose adminis
trations refuse to recognize the
conditions in their institutions be
cause of economic benefit to be
derived?
"Is California herself afraid to
call a spade a spade because
of tlie danger of forcing 'pro
fessional' teams off a possible
schedule?
"(>—ls some of the available material
al California wasted by poor meth
ods? Are California's athletes tired
out from too strenuous practice?
Do they have longer hours of prac
tice than other coast colleges? Are
they discouraged by inconsistent

; substitution practices? Do the
coaches show them where they are
wrong in their work, or are they
left to shift for themselves too
much in the face of caustic criti
cism?
"Undercover Politics?
"7—ls there some kind of under
cover politics or society intrigues
below the surface of the California
varsity?
"What happened before the Big
Game last year that hit the morale
of an otherwise successful team?
What happened to lower the spirit
of the men before the U.S.C. game
started last Saturday? Why isn't
it possible for a California team to
have the same enthusiasm and
steam roller attitude as her op
ponents?
"B—Would it be advisable to have
the graduate manager maintain
closer control over the coach
ing situation? Would it be
a good idea to leave the head
coach as he is, but to let some
one else than lie have a say in
the choosing of assistant
coaches? Are all, and which,
of the present assistants living
up to the real California stan
dards of athlctics themselves?
If not, can the players be ex
pected to get much inspira
tion?
"These are a lot of questions.
There are a lot of others. We don't
pretend to know the answer to them.
If California had lost to U.S.C. by a
slim margin, these questions would
have waited until later, but now
they are bound to come up, and we
have said previously, it is best that
they be asked and answered here
within our own circles. Until they are
answered, and until something defi
nite is done, California athletics are
not likely to perk up very notice
ably."
