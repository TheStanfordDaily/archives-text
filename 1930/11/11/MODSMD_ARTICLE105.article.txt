### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10. iA't— A
charge that Communists in Russia
lent aid to members of their party
in this country to increase unem
ployment was made today by the
Rev. Father Edmund Walsh before
the House Communist Investigation
Committee.
Father Walsh, who is vice-presi
dent of Georgetown University, told
the committee that he made a study
of Soviet activities in Europe last
summer and found considerable un
rest due to what he described as
Soviet dumping.
The educator read from a report
of the World Congress held at Mos
cow stating that unemployment was
a growing object of Communists in
America and that it had been spon
sored in a special campaign. The
campaign, the report said, was pro
moted in the anthracite and bitu
minous strikes in Pennsylvania and
attacks against the American Fed
eration of Labor.
He translated a report of the
Soviet Congresses, saying the revo
lutionary center in America was in
its 13,000,000 negroes but said the
Communists had not succeeded in
advancing their cause in this direc
tion or among the farmers.
In that connection, the report said
the Soviets had not been able "to
do anything with the Pullman car
porter."
