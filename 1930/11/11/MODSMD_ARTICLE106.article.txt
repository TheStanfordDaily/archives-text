# STUDENTS TO PAY DAMAGES IN REED DORMITORY RIOTS
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 10 (/P). â€”
Dormitory F at Reed College here
today had a bill for $5 from the col
lege for using the fire hose in a
dormitory fight, and it had the word
of the superintendent of buildings
that it must redecorate the walls, re
pair broken windows and replace
washed out shrubbery at consider
able expense.
Students of other houses had ac
cused House F of stealing Dormi
tory G's electric sign. Much was
said. During the night a picked
squad from four other houses be- j
sieged the dormitory, bound and 1
gagged nine of the ten occupants
and carried them to a deserted shack.
Police released the students and they
returned to their house. Other stu
dents gathered to boo them. House 1
F unlimbered a fire hose. Windows
were broken by the stream and the ,
inside of the house ruined when the
hose squirmed out of control.
At 5 a.m. today, students of other
houses climaxed the disturbance by
wiring and nailing up all doors of
the besieeed dormitory.
