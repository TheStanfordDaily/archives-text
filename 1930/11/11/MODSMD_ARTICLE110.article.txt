# AUTOS RULED OFF CAMPUS 25 YEARS AGO Special Gate Provided For "Infernal Contraptions" NOW PLANE TRAFFIC REQUIRES LEGISLATION
## 
### 
The elaboi'ate parking arrange
ments and the colorful legions of
cars at the Stanford-U.S.C. game and
the fact that 25 years ago yesterday
the first automobile was allowed on
the Stanford campus is an interesting
commentary on modern progress.
The first man to own a car on the
Stanford campus was Robert Loesier
who was doing graduate work at
Stanford 25 years ago. He lived on
the campus with his wife and was the
proud possessor of a Lozier automo
bile, the acme of speed and power
in those days. However, he was not
allowed to bring the "infernal con
traption'' onto the campus.
Cars Left Outside
Having to leave the machine out
side the "Highball Gates," which
were then the farthest outpost of the
University, and then having to walk
in to his classes eventually got on
his nerves and he got into the bad
habit of deliberately taking down
the chains in complete disregard of

law and driving in.
The University authorities even
tually capitulated under his constant
fire, and the final result was the an
nouncement in the Daily Palo Alto,
Thursday, November 9, 1905, that
automobiles would be allowed inside
the University grounds on the day
of the Big Game of that year.
Special Entrance
The conditions were: "A special
entrance will be provided on the
County road east of the main en
trance to the estate. The machine
will be restricted to the main
thoroughfare, and will not be al
lowed to go past the athletic
grounds."
Last year, the University refused
to allow planes flying to the Big
Game to land on the Palo Alto field.
By 1955, this ruling may be abolished,
but in the meantime a new ruling
prohibiting rocket cars, and indi
vidual wings may come up to. stay
"on the books" for a couple of dec
ades.
