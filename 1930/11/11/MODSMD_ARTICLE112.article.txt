### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. .10 (/P).â€”The
assertion that the Soviet's five year
industrialization plan was designed
to bring about such disastrous eco
nomic conditions as to accomplish a
world revolution was made today by
the Rev. Father Edmund Walsh, vice
president of Georgetown University,
in testimony.
Father Walsh, who was with the
American Relief Commission in Rus
sia several years ago said the Soviets
planned to create world-wide econo
mic depression by dumping into the
world markets products of enslaved
labor.
He read from a book by G. T.
Grinko, creator of the five year in
dustrial plan, which said that "the
five year plan is an important part
of the offensive of the proletariat of
the world against capitalism; it is
a plan tending to undermine capital
istic stabilization; it is a great plan
of world revolution."
