### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 l/P).â€”
James W. Gerard, former ambassa
dor to Germany and now treasurer
of the Democratic National Commit
tee, predicted today that Germany
probably would repudiate the Young
plan for reparations payments within
18 months.
Expressing doubt that the German
people would carry on the payments
much longer, Gerard said that peo
ple who bought German bonds
would never see their money again.
As soon as Germany stops paying
its war debt, the former ambassador
said, countries now owing the United
States immediately would seek re
lief from their debts.
Mr. Gerard was in Washington to
attend the convention of the Ameri
can Manganese Products Association
and called on President Hoover to
pay his respects. He said he did not
discuss German conditions with the
President.
