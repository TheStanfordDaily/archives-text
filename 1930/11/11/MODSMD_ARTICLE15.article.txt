# COURT QUASHES DOHENY CHARGE
## Judge Holds Leases Of Oil Land Free Of Fraud 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10 (/P).â€”'The
leases negotiated by' Edward L.
Doheny, oil magnate, for the Pan-
American Western Petroleum Com
pany to 660 acres of oil lands in the
Elk Hills naval reserve No. 1 were
held valid and free of fraud in a
decision today by Federal Judge
Frank H. Norcross of Nevada.
The judgment was the outcome of
the civil suit instituted by the Fed
eral Government against the com
pany on ground of alleged fraud last
winter in one of the last of the long
line of court actions begun by the
Government since the disclosure of
the oil scandals of the Harding ad
ministration.
Leases Valid
By the decision the leases, now
controlled by the Richfield Oil Com
pany of California through purchase
of the Doheny interests in Pan-
American, remain undisturbed and
give Richfield the right to explora
tion of one of the greatest potential
oil fields in California.
A second important phase of the
judgment is the release of a reserve
fund of $5,000,000 established by
Richfield to meet, possible govern
ment demands for reimbursement
for oil already taken from the re
serve in the event it won the case
Protect Supply
This, the Doheny interests denied
and countered with the statement
that the leases had been made to
protect the reserve from a possible
draining of its oil supplies by other
companies which were drilling ac
tively on adjoining land.
Judge Norcross ruled that no fraud
occurred in these transactions. The
decision had been under considera
tion by hi. i for nearly nine months.
