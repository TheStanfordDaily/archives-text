# PRACTICE SEES SHIFT USED BY COUCH WARNER
## Grays Score On Subs When Hancock Nabs Fumble To Make Run AFFLERBAUGH IS GOOD 
### 
What Coach Glenn "Pop" Warner
emphatically denies is a move to
adopt the shift, hut what is never
theless an innovation to the present
generation of Stanford football fans,
was put on display to newspaper
men and'students at gridiron prac
tice last night. Incidentally, it was
the last open practice of the year.
Warner declaring that everyone will
be barred in the future.
Using a team comprised of men
who saw less than a lull quarter of
action against Washington Saturday,
Warner sent them into scrimmage
against the Grays. The "shift," as it
can be called, since it embodies all
the principles of that style of play,
enables the offensive team to
change from a wide open "C" for
mation with balanced line, to a close
"A" formation with unbalanced
line, before the ball is snapped.
Such an attack entails the mov
ing, after taking a position on the
line of scrimmage, of one tackle,
both ends and two backs, and is
calculated to catch the defense be
fore it can set itself to meet the new
attack.
At his home last night, Warner
declared that the move was abso
lutely not to be construed to mean
that he was going over to the shift,
a system which he does not endorse.
He said that he was merely experi
menting and that lie had used the
identical thing at Pittsburgh Uni
versity, and had even equipped his
1924 Stanford varsity with such a
shift, although they did not use it
more than once against California.
