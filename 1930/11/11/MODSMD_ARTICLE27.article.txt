With all the men who played a
full quarter in the Husky game en
joying a rest away from the prac
tice field, the third string Redshirts
yesterday afternoon benefitted by a
lot of attention from the Old Fox.
After they had worked at the
dummy machine for a while to get
warmed up, Coach Cuddeback
brought his hard-fighting Gray out
fit onto the varsity lot to give the
Warner-coached men a tough tussle
in a scrimmage that could almost be
callcd a game.
Grays Fight Hard
Except that yardsticks, timekeep
ers, water boys, scoreboards, and
similar paraphernalia were not in
evidence, things looked almost like
a real contest, with both sides ex
hibiting fight that would iook good
in any Conference game.
Though the varsity outfit included
Dawson, Hand, Tyler, and Gray,
who have performed in many min
utes of Conference play for the
Cardinal, the Gray squad vas al
most its equal on the defence, and
did a little ball advancing of its own
wnen in possession of the pigskin.
In fact, the Grays might be credited
with the only touchdown, when
Hancock nabbed a fumble that,
didn't strike the ground and raced
fifty yards untouched.
Party Rough
The party got so rough about the
time the lights had to be turned on
that Hardy, third string varsity half,
and Bush at end were forced to
leave the game and lie panting on
the sidelines for awhile.
Wilson looked good tearing
through the Gray line with nicely
formed interference in front of him,
as did "Dusty" Allen at lull. Hand
and Dawson, who have seen plenty
of varsity competition, naturally
stood out: Tyler, whom fans remem
ber as showing so well against the
Huskies Saturday, kept the Grays
worried, though passing was not on
the program for the afternoon.
Cal Tech Meet
Warner's men found AfTlerbaugh,
who played for the freshmen last
year, quite hard to stop when he got
going with the pigskin tucked under
his arm. Clark at tackle for Cudde
back's men also annoyed the var
sity gridmen at times.
Tomorrow, Warner's "52" will all
be present to start this business of
preparing for the decrepit Golden
Bear, which may have in two weeks
recovered the old-time ferocity it
usually has in store for its Cardinal
rival.
However, the Redshirts have yet
to dispose of Cal Tech next Satur
day in the annual "breather" before
the Big Game.

ber as showing so well against the
Huskies Saturday, kept the Grays
worried, though passing was not on
the program for the afternoon.
Cal Tech Meet
Warner's men found AfTlerbaugh,
who played for the freshmen last
year, quite hard to stop when he got
going with the pigskin tucked under
his arm. Clark at tackle for Cudde
back's men also annoyed the var
sity gridmen at times.
Tomorrow, Warner's "52" will all
be present to start this business of
preparing for the decrepit Golden
Bear, which may have in two weeks
recovered the old-time ferocity it
usually has in store for its Cardinal
rival.
However, the Redshirts have yet
to dispose of Cal Tech next Satur
day in the annual "breather" before
the Big Game.
With all the men who played a
full quarter in the Husky game en
joying a rest away from the prac
tice field, the third string Redshirts
yesterday afternoon benefitted by a
lot of attention from the Old Fox.
After they had worked at the
dummy machine for a while to get
warmed up, Coach Cuddeback
brought his hard-fighting Gray out
fit onto the varsity lot to give the
Warner-coached men a tough tussle
in a scrimmage that could almost be
callcd a game.
Grays Fight Hard
Except that yardsticks, timekeep
ers, water boys, scoreboards, and
similar paraphernalia were not in
evidence, things looked almost like
a real contest, with both sides ex
hibiting fight that would iook good
in any Conference game.
Though the varsity outfit included
Dawson, Hand, Tyler, and Gray,
who have performed in many min
utes of Conference play for the
Cardinal, the Gray squad vas al
most its equal on the defence, and
did a little ball advancing of its own
wnen in possession of the pigskin.
In fact, the Grays might be credited
with the only touchdown, when
Hancock nabbed a fumble that,
didn't strike the ground and raced
fifty yards untouched.
Party Rough
The party got so rough about the
time the lights had to be turned on
that Hardy, third string varsity half,
and Bush at end were forced to
leave the game and lie panting on
the sidelines for awhile.
Wilson looked good tearing
through the Gray line with nicely
formed interference in front of him,
as did "Dusty" Allen at lull. Hand
and Dawson, who have seen plenty
of varsity competition, naturally
stood out: Tyler, whom fans remem
ber as showing so well against the
Huskies Saturday, kept the Grays
worried, though passing was not on
the program for the afternoon.
