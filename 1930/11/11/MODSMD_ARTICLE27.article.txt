Dawson, Hand, Tyler, and Gray,
who have performed in many min

Cardinal, the Gray squad vas al

did a little ball advancing of its own

Party Rough

and Bush at end were forced to

the sidelines for awhile.
Wilson looked good tearing
through the Gray line with nicely
formed interference in front of him,
as did "Dusty" Allen at lull. Hand
and Dawson, who have seen plenty
of varsity competition, naturally
