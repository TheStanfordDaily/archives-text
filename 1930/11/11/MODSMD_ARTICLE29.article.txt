# ARMISTICE; BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING
## 
### 
It was 12, years ago today thai the* strife and turmoil of the
World War were brought to an end with the signing of the Armi
stice. It was 12 years ago that the nations engaged in that costly
conflict pledged themselves to peace in signing the Armistice.
< )ver a decade has passed since that day, and it seems a long
period. The World War is now history, and the Armistice signing
is likewise history. Hut the significance of that signing is a thing
alive, brought to our attention every year on Armistice Day.
Today at Stanford we will remember those who sacrificed their
lives on the I European battlegrounds and those who served at home,
but chiefly we will remember the peace that was brought with the
Armistice signing and hope that it wll be permanent.
Stanford will observe \rmistice Day with the presentation of
Itrahms' "lvequiem" in the Memorial Church tonight. Never before
lias the I'niversitv attempted anything in a musical wav quite so
difficult as this. 'I he impressive music of I'.rahms will be presented
by the I'niversitv Choir, augmented by representatives from every
church choir in I'alo Alto, and by an orchestra including 30 mem
brrs of the San brancisco Symphony.
The I'niversitv tonight will honor its war dead, at the same time
that it commemorates the signing of the Armistice with its pledge
ol peace to the living. It should be a beautiful and inspiring event.
