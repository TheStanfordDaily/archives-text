# REQUIEM TO BE GIVEN TONIGHT
## Tribute Paid War Veterans In Church Services 
### 
Stanford University will pay trib
ute tonight at the Armistice Day
services in the Memorial Church to
those who died for their country
during the World War. In commem
oration of the signing of the Armis
tice 12 years ago a musical program
will be presented at 8 o'clock.
The order of the service will be
very simple, according to the direc
tor, W. D. Allen. Two organ pre
ludes, Cesar Franck's "Piece Hero
ique," and Schubert's "Litany" will
be played by Benjamin S. Moore,
organist of Trinity Church, San
Francisco. Dr. D. C. Gardner, chap
lain, will pronounce the invocation,
Masterpiece (liven
Brahms' "Requiem" for the
chorus, orchestra, and two soloists
v/ill be the feature of the program.
It is one of the shortest of the fam
ous choral masterpieces, as only a
little more than an hour is required
for its performance, according to
Allen. The text is selected with the
principal aim of comforting the sor
rowing and giving hope for the
hereafter.
"No music ever sung in the Mc
morial Church has aroused such
eager but reverent enthusiasm," de
clared Allen in discussing the piece.
"The whole gamut of human emo
tions is sounded from the first
chorus with its subdued but deep
feeling, to the ecstatic outburst in
the second number. The transitory
character of human existence i.; t m
phasized in the introductions to the
second and third parts. The final
number is a benediction. Here the
harp aids the orchestra in coloring
the voice parts with a celestial ef
fect."
Requiem Real Treat
The performance of the "Requiem"
has attracted widespread attention
and Allen expects that the chapel
will be filled to capacity with music
lovers from Stanford and all parts
of the peninsula. No more tickets
are available but the general public
will be admitted without tickets
after the presentation begins if
there are any empty seats.
The doors will open at 7:15 o'clock.
The organ prelude is to begin at
8:05 o'clock, and the "Requiem" at
8:15 o'clock. Those unable to re
serve scats for the evening may

era' rehearsal at 3 o'clock tomorrow
