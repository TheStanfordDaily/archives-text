# JUNKING THE JUNKETERS
## 
### 
Members of the freshman class went through .-ill the motions
oi choosing officers last week, hut no one was elected. As no can
didate received a majority, hrst-year men and women must repeal
the tiresome voting procedure todav.
At Stanford, where there is little student interest in campus
polities, a complicated election system requiring rcvotes is a joke.
( 'nlv hall the freshmen voted last week; and judging from the past,
about one-third of the class will east ballots today.
\nd after the selections are finally made, what will be the result ?
\ president and three satellites are chosen. There is nothing for
the three lesser officers to do. no one expects them to do anything,
Mid as a result, they don't. And still the campus goes through the
farcical routine twice a year of filling dead positions.
The class presidency was formerly and should be one of the
most important positions on the campus, contested for by the real
leaders of the class. The Kxecutive Committee could, by junking
ibe dead-wood offices and by instituting a single vote election, do
miii h to enhance the prestige of that position.
\t the same time responsibility would he centered on one man,
v\ 11ic11 should insure a more efficient administration.
