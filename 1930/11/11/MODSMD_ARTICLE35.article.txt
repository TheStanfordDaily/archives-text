A RICH MAN'S DAUGHTER. By
K. 11. Mottram. Harper and
Brothers, 1 DItO. New York. (At
tin* Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Mottram, deserts his favorite
i World War theme to follow the post
war reactions of Geoffrey Skene,
I the hero of "The Spanish Farm
Trilogy."
Skene, back from France, and
following a peaceful and uneventful
career as an architect, is vaguely
i dissatisfied ' with his unemotional
but comfortable mode of life. It has
almost but not quite anaesthetised
the mental sufferings which were
Ihe result l'o his war experiences,
when he fails in love with the
daughter of a war-time profiteer.
From beginning to end I lie author
handles his characters and his plot
deftly. The story moyes smoothly
| excepl that he is occasionally guilty
of a lapse into lengthy and crypti
cally complicated sentence forma
tion. —S. C. A.
DRACUIjA—At the President Thea
tre, San Francisco.
This blood-curdling horri hel
ioses much of its effectiveness in the
transfer from the printed page to
the stage. Bram Stoker, in writing
! his novel of the "Undead," gave it,
through his own literary ability, a
far greater reality than is possible
in the dramatization of it.

| As an eerie thriller, however, it
i is acceptable, the high point of ac
tion being reached in the clash be
tween the horrible Count Dracula,
the werewolf-vampire-human ghost,
and Professor Van Helsing, the groat
; scientist. Incidentally, J. Frank
! Glenden, who portrayed Van Hel
j sing, gave the sole convincing per
formance of the evening, the rest of
the cast overplaying their respective
■ parts to a marked degree. —R. J. F.
(HUM YOUTH. By John Held, Jr.
The Vanguard Press. 19110. (At
Uie Palo Alto Book Shop.)
With words instead of with lines
John Held, Jr., sketches in "Grim
' Youth" the boys and girls of the
collegiate scene whom he drew so
well in establishing his reputation
as one of America's most amusing
illustrators.
And very well ipdeed does he
manipulate the new medium. The
characters, of "Ordeal" and"The
Awakening" may be found on most
campuses, and those of "Man of the
World" on many.
Some of the remaining sketches
and stories are not so deserving of
praise. But on the whole the some
times very grim youths portrayed
in "Grim Youth" are both so true
and smile-provoking as to make the
volume popular even on a campus.

as one of America's most amusing
illustrators.
And very well ipdeed does he
manipulate the new medium. The
characters, of "Ordeal" and"The
Awakening" may be found on most
campuses, and those of "Man of the
World" on many.
Some of the remaining sketches
and stories are not so deserving of
praise. But on the whole the some
times very grim youths portrayed
in "Grim Youth" are both so true
and smile-provoking as to make the
volume popular even on a campus.

A RICH MAN'S DAUGHTER. By
K. 11. Mottram. Harper and
Brothers, 1 DItO. New York. (At
tin* Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Mottram, deserts his favorite
i World War theme to follow the post
war reactions of Geoffrey Skene,
I the hero of "The Spanish Farm
Trilogy."
Skene, back from France, and
following a peaceful and uneventful
career as an architect, is vaguely
i dissatisfied ' with his unemotional
but comfortable mode of life. It has
almost but not quite anaesthetised
the mental sufferings which were
Ihe result l'o his war experiences,
when he fails in love with the
daughter of a war-time profiteer.
From beginning to end I lie author
handles his characters and his plot
deftly. The story moyes smoothly
| excepl that he is occasionally guilty
of a lapse into lengthy and crypti
cally complicated sentence forma
tion. —S. C. A.
DRACUIjA—At the President Thea
tre, San Francisco.
This blood-curdling horri hel
ioses much of its effectiveness in the
transfer from the printed page to
the stage. Bram Stoker, in writing
! his novel of the "Undead," gave it,
through his own literary ability, a
far greater reality than is possible
in the dramatization of it.

| As an eerie thriller, however, it
i is acceptable, the high point of ac
tion being reached in the clash be
tween the horrible Count Dracula,
the werewolf-vampire-human ghost,
and Professor Van Helsing, the groat
; scientist. Incidentally, J. Frank
! Glenden, who portrayed Van Hel
j sing, gave the sole convincing per
formance of the evening, the rest of
the cast overplaying their respective
■ parts to a marked degree. —R. J. F.

John Held, Jr., sketches in "Grim

collegiate scene whom he drew so
well in establishing his reputation
