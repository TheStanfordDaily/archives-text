It may be a trifle late to keep
on gurgling about the manly
exhibition of football with dear
old U.W. last week-end, but the
fact remains that the best tackle
of the day was made by one of
the midgets who cavorted dur
ing half time.
There seems to be a grudge of
long standing between the band and
the handsome yell-leaders, but it
would be much better if the boys
chbsc some day other than Saturday
to work it off. Then, too, when our
own D. Liebendorfer booms out
through the public address system
with some final Eastern scores, the
band is a cinch to break loose with
"Lights Out.''
The epidemic of smoked
glasses that has struck the cam
pus has far-reaching effects.
One absent-minded soph wan
dered into I'alo Alto, put out
his hand to see if it was raining,

and got two dimes, a cigarette,
and four buttons before he could
withdraw the iunchhook.
And then there is the sad, sad
tale of the goose and the gold-plated
egg. It seems there was a certain j
required course in a certain depart
ment known to the majors in said
department as a "pipe." The dis- '
covery was bruited about the cam- j
pus, resulting in a mad scramble by j
students who were not majors in the :
aforesaid department, all seeking
five units of gravy.
Unfortunately, the professor |
teaching the course became in
formed of the light in which it
was regarded, and promptly put
on the screws. Result: Twenty
per cent of the class flunked,
every single one of them a ma
jor in that particular school, and
forced to take (he course as a
requirement. Moral: One man's
gravy may have flies in it.
