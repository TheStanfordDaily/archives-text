### Abe Mellinkoff 
A survey conducted at the Ue.iver-
I sity of Minnesota revealed that stu
dents say they study better listen -
! ing to jazz. This might be true if the
; proper popular selections were at
hand.
If might he easy to read "Xeno
phane's March" to the strains of "Red
Hot Rhythm"; or hear "If I Had a
Girl Like You" while studying
Shakespeare's "Anthony and Cleo
patra"; or write a report on Jane
I Austen's "Emma" to the melodies of
i "One Hour Alone With You To
night."
i One professor at the University of
1 West Virginia advises students not
1 to make the publishers rich by buy-
I ing so may text books. And if the
rest of the faculty would abstain
i from assigning readings in texts
maybe the advice would mean some
thing.
It is a favorite pastime among stu
dents to talk about the absent
minded professor. At the University
: of Washington, they enjoy relating
I about faculty members who forget
the combinations of their postoffice
boxes.
Yet one never meets a professor
who forgets to give a final; or who
put his cigar liutt in the mail box
and dropped a "smokeout" into the
waste basket; or who told his wife
to study for the mid-term and kissed
the co-ed goodnight.
The seniors at Franklin and Mar
shall Colleges have chosen Greta
Garbo as the class sweetheart.
Benjamin Franklin might take the
matter stoically hut one might be
sure that John Marshall would dc- i
dare the seniors' action unconstitu
tional.
Of all sweethearts, the Garbo is j
the worst; she always looks as if j
she needed a cold shower or more i
sleep.
