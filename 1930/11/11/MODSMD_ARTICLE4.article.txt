Donnybrook variety when the State
Legislature convens November 18.

: Commission, just out, provides for
Khe abolition of seventeen branches
of the State government, with the
elimination of salaries, emoluments,
1 free automobiles and other easy

Politicians Sharpen Axes
The whir of the grindstone may
be heard throughout the State as
the politicians sharpen their axes in
preparation for the opening legisla
tive session when the report will be
presented.
The Abell commission is in reality
the State Audit and Finance Com
mission, headed by Frank D. Abell,
an astute Morristown banker,
schooled in State politics for many
years. A budget czar is recom
mended in the report, with aug
mented power by the governor in
State finance.
