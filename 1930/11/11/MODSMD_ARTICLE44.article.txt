## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (/P). —
Seeing "more gloom and cynicism in
regard to the possibility of peace"
now than at any time since 1918, Dr.
Henry A. Atkinson of New York to
day told the World Alliance for In
ternational Friendship through the
churches that religious principles
should prove a partial panacea for
the world's unrest.
Dr. Atkinson, general secretary of
the alliance, at the opening session
of the organization's good will con- !
ference, attributed a portion of the
"fear of the spread of Communism"
to "deplorable economic conditions
which exist in almost every coun- |
try."
"The assembly of the League of !
Nations just closed," he said, "lacked
the atmosphere of hope and buoy- '
ancy that has marked the others, and i
instead everyone felt the deep fog I
which seemed to envelop every com
mittee and all the efforts of leaders :
to find a way out of the difficulties."
