# TEN STUDENTS CHARGED WITH TICKET CHANGE
## Case Of Scalping Reported; Fines, Blacklisting Probable Penalty 
### 
Ten students were accused of
transferring rooters' tickets for the
Washington game last Saturday, at
a meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control yesterday.
These students will be called be
fore men's and women's councils at
the next meeting of these bodies,
and will probably be fined $2.50,
according to Ernest Hatch of the
Rally Committee. Those found
guilty of repeated offenses may be
blacklisted.
A ticket bought by Bernard B.
Pollard was reported held by Frank
Ghilardi at the game, according to
the 8.A.C.; that of E. T. Harwood by
Micheall Hanavan, and Myer J.
Heppner's by Mrs. M. J. Heppner.
The ticket of Lewis F. Seap was
said to be held by Louis C. Speuy;
Frederick B. Hilmer's by E. E.
Sunydef; and Katherine Deahl's by
W. O. Wayman.
G. H. Bisceglia's ticket had been
transferred to K. L. Wentz; and
Logan Gray's to James L. Wilson.
The name of the person who held
Tom Campbell's ticket is not known.
Mack J. Hamilton had scalped his
ticket for $2, the B.A.C. reported.
These people will be brought be
fore council as the result of the
action taken by the Rally Commit
tee and the B.A.C. to stop transfer
of rooters' tickets which, according
to Hatch, leads to disorderly conduct
and booing in the rooting section.
The Men's Council will convene
at 2 o'clock this afternoon in the
Old Union and the Women's Council
will be called to meeting today by
Betty Alden, president of the wo
men's body. All offenders listed
above are to be present at the re
spective council meetings today, ac
cording to Hatch.
