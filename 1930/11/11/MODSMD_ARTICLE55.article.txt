Princeton likes its hot fudge sand- j
wich, Stanford its buttered snail.
Thirty dozen snails are consumed j
daily by Stanford students, according j
to Claude Strauss, manager of the i
Union Cellai\
The western snail has not yet J
spread eastward to supplant the I
waffle at Harvard, nor the coffee-sop j
at Yale. At Washington it goes dis- ,
guised as a butterhorn. At Kansas i
they twist it the other direction and I
call it a bun.
Sprung from the lowly cinnamon j
roll, the snail has been flattened and j
spiraled, spattered with nuts, and the ]
roofing of whipped butter now marks i
it for Stanford's own.
Of 1200 students who eat in the j
Cellar daily, 400 order the delectable i
snail. Also, the high standard of !
health at Stanford may be traceable
to the 45 gallons of orange juice sold i
daily at the Cellar as against 25 J
gallons of coffee.
