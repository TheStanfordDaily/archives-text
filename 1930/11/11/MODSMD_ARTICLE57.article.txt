# CHINESE ESTABLISH CONFUCIAN SCHOOL

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10. (/P)â€” !
In order that the memory of Confu
cius may not perish among the I
modern Chinese in America, a tem- j
pie for the perpetuation of the great, j
sage's teachings has been established
in San Francisco's Chinatown.
In keeping with the example set t
by the teacher the temple is a sim- i
pie little suite of rooms in an or
dinary brick and frame building.
There are none of the grotesque
curlicues so often seen in Chinese j
architecture, and there is nothing ;
of the joss or tong aspect to the i
headquarters.
From this temple, which was
dedicated October 18, will be dis
seminated instruction and literature j
to such Chinese as desire to know '
more about classical China.
