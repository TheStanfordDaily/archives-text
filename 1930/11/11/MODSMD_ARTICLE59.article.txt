Education has been so rapid, espe
cially within recent years, that the

according to Dean Ellwood P. Cub
berley. "Today we need more teach
ing staff, better library facilities,
laboratory space for special work,
more offices, and additional endow
ment to finance both the teaching
and research work of the school. An
education building, built and equip
ped for graduate work, is a special
need."
