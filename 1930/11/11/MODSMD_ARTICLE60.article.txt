# SPEED OF PLANES TO BE REGULATED BY SHIFT OF WING

### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10. </P) —As
the automobile driver shifts gears,
so (he airplane pilot of the future
may shift the wings of his craft, in
creasing or diminishing his speed.
Waldo D. Waterman, pilot, re
cently developed a flexible wing ship
here. By pressing a button he can
raise or lower the wings.
A later device was worked out
and demonstrated here by H. D.
Rocheville, an airplane designer,
whereby the wings are raised and
lowered in sections by means of a
crank. The extreme tip of the wings
and center or main sections can be
moved independently.
The inventors claim the plane's
speed can be increased from live to
30 miles an hour or throttled down
accordingly for a landing.
