BERKELEY, Nov. 10. OP)â€”Ed
ward O. Heinrich, criminalogist, has
returned from a trip through Eu
rope with information on new meth
ods of detecting crime.
He said European police are able
to identify persons disfigured by
burns by making a death mask and
removing the scars.
Blood stains in clothing can also
be detected, Heinrich said, through
use of ultra-violet and infra-rays
despite efforts of the murderer to
wash the stains out with chemicals.
Heinrich said the European police
have a new method for determining
whether pearls are real or culti
vated. He also declared the Ger
mans have the best-trained police
organization in the world.
