# DOLLARS SAVED IN CORPORATION YARD ON BROKEN DESKS
## 
### 
From junk to useful equipment
inside of a week.
That is the program carried out
in the local Corporation Yard. Nu
merous broken and worn chairs,
desks, and beds are now being over
hauled by this department.
Several hundred dollars is annu
ally saved through the reclamation
process taking place in the school
shops. All of the broken and worn
dormitory equipment is sent to the
Corporation Yard for repair.
Besides fixing old equipment, the
yard keeps the University buildings
in condition. A large staff of men is
kept busy on this end of the yard's
activities throughout the year.
