j Communication between officers of
I the California Highway Patrol and
I their district and central offices by
j means of radio telephone is under
| experiment, the headquarters of the
| patrol announced here today.
Commenting on the experiment,
Frank G. Snook, chief of the divi
sion of motor vehicles, declared
highway law enforcement work in
California would be revolutionized
if the method proves successful.
A special type of radio telephone,
light enough to be carried on a
motorcycle, but powerful enough to
have a range of several hundred
miles, is being considered. If suc
cessful this would enable the dis
trict inspector or squad captain to
get in immediate communication
! with his men in case of accident or
| other emergency requiring quick
} movement of officers from one place
1 to another.
