# ARMISTICE RECALLS "WAR INFORMATION BOARD"; NOW FOR VARIETY BULLETINS
## 
### 
Twelve years ago today, Stanford |
students read the details of the
Armistice on a certain bulletin board
on the campus which is still in serv
ice.
Scarred and mutilated from years
of faithful service the recloutable
board is the one to the left upon
entering the Inner Quad from the
Memorial Court.
Warfare News
At present it holds information
concerning $20 automobiles, board
and room, dances, debates, type
writers, concerts, and hotels. Thir
teen years ago it held forth on the
assignments of the University's
R.O.T.C. corps and the trend of the
warfare in Europe.
Then the R.O.T.C. was working to .
train men for the army. Many men j
from here served overseas, who had
their primary training on the campus.
All universities were war-minded
and centers for the training of men.
Everything was run on a war basis 1

in every branch of society and edu
cational institutions were not ex- j
cepted. The war bulletin board was |
one manifestation of this influence.
Board In Disuse
Beneath a coat of paint the old
lettering, "War Information Board,"
may be dimly seen at the top of the
board, which at that time carried
orders for the cadets and World
wide news.
Whereas then, the bulletin board
was the center of interest on the
campus, it is seldom noticed, now,
by students hurrying by to classes
with football paramount in their
minds.
