# SIDELINE SLANTS

Ho hum .... Cal Tech this week
end .... a tough week for slants
. . . . have to rehash Saturday's
games .... went over that with Pop
Sunday, though .... didn't say any
thing about • U.C.L.A they
held Oregon to one touchdown ....
improving right along .... did better
against U.S.C. than Cal. did . . . .
70-0 or 52-0 .... wonder who they'll
U«'t to coach football at California
next .... Captain Tandy: "The Stan
lord game is all that matters now"
.... hardly thought the Bears would
point for Nevada .... wish Oregon
played a good team this year ....
maybe Oregon State can knock them
over .... wish my cousin would
write and tell me what he thinks of
Spears .... get the undergraduates'
view of the new coach .... Wash
ington State meets Washington Sat
urday .... Hollingbery should win
this one too .... never will figure
out how the Trojans lost to that
team St. Mary's plays Fordham
. . . . Madigan lost to California
California has not won a major con
test yet .... wonder what a certain
S.F. sports editor thinks of St. Mary's
now .... what a flock of wishes and
"wonder il" in the column today . . . .
glad 1 ducked the front page story
. . . . Crawford and Jernegan can
handle it ... . saves me work too
. . . . probably have to write both
slants and varsity the week before
the Big Game .... it'll give me the
opportunity to watch secret practice
.... Pop has been good in granting
interviews, too .... a keen mind
there .... what a kick he gets out
of the fan mail .... forgot to say
the field generalship against Wash
ington was the best to date . . . .
that business of using Moffatt from
the back fullback post out 'on the
40-yard line and then running a
reverse from the same formation on
the 4-yard line gave us our first
touchdown Washington was
overrated .... hear that Spears is a
better man than Phelan .... went to
that fool movie last night .... it
opened with a cheer for Coach Nibs
Price .... that got a laugh from the
boys .... sitting in back of a couple
of members of the squad .... they
noticed the picture of Walt Heinecke
on the wall too .... believe there
was also a picture of "Dink" Temple
ton in tVie background .... typical
pose, knickers and all . . . . four
quarterbacks on that Jones team
Saunders and Harpster, Banger of
Tulane, and the hero .... alias
Tommy Dowler of Colgate . . . .
shots of the U.S.C.-Cal. games and
Stanford-Cal. games .... another
punk "collegiate" picture .... the
business staff will like that crack
.... I paid for my seat, so I can say
what I like .... maybe .... if they
could make up their minds how
many pages the Big Game edition
will run it would help .... no
pictorial section this year .... frosh
football over .... Bradshaw did well
with the men he had .... rain prob
ably did us more harm than Cal
Saturday .... two years in a row
for Cal Frosh .... more howl on the
lower division cut .... Walter Win
chell will be green with envy when
he sees this .... perhaps some day
I'll develop a style of my own ....
Charlie Wegner of the composing
loom said he wanted to see me fill
up a column with nothing at all ... .
here it is ... . "just like Melntyre
does" .... only he gets paid for it
. . . . wonder how many of the 500
read the sport page of the Daily
. ... no reason why they should ....
expect most of them got more of a
kick out of the between-halves game
than the Washington game .... all
of the women on the staff will in
dignantly uphold the athletic interest
of the fair sex and upbraid me now
. . . . hope this will fill the space ....
let 'em run a cut of Captain Howie
Fumbles of Jerkwater College below
if it doesn't.
