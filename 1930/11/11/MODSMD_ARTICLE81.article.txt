# DO-X PROCEEDS ON SECOND STAGE OF ATLANTIC JOURNEY
## 
### 
AMSTERDAM, Nov. 10 (TP).â€”
After a tardy start and a subsequent
return to Amsterdam, Germany's
Hying colossus, the Do-X, flew away
from here today for Calshot, Eng
land, on the second stage of its trans-
Atlantic flight to New York.
The first take-off was from the
waters of the Zuider Zee at 10:30
a.m. Presumably the ship was off
for England, but she rwas soon seen
landing in the haze in the Zuider
Zee. After remaining on the sur
face of the/vater for a few minutes,
the plane got up again and continued
on her way.
Precisely at noon the giant ship
passed over Amsterdam in the bril
liant sunshine, flying steadily and
beautifully and its twelve motors
making the noise of a dozen planes.
The plane had 17 crew members
aboard and 23 passengers, including
Claude Dornier, its inventor, and
Frau Dornier. From Calshot it will
proceed to Havre, France; Corunna,
Spain, and Lisbon, before undertak
ng the actual trans-Atlantic journey.
