### 
By Lowell Cox
Determined to wipe out the 2 to
1 defeat bunded them by San Mateo
Junior College last month, the Stan
ford soccer team will tangle with
the peninsula eleven tomorrow
afternoon. The game will be played
at 3:45 o'clock on the San Mateo
high school field.
The Cardinals will be favorites in
tomorrow's fray in spite of the pre
vious loss, as Coach Harry Maloney's
boys have shown great improvement
in the last month. Two weeks ago
they shut out the San Jose Staters,
3 to 0, which outfit has since downed
the San Mateans.
Offense Improves
Strong on defense since the first
of the season, the Cards have shown
particular improvement on offense.
Better scoring punch would have
won the first San Mateo fracas, and
it is believed will cop tomorrow's
game.
In scrimmage against the frosh
yesterday, the varsity scored a goal
within two minutes after the starting
whistle, Miller booting the ball into
the net for the count.
Light Practice
After a long and grueling workout
yesterday, the squad will take it
easy this afternoon in tapering off
for the game. A short scrimmage
and passing drill is expected to be
the order of the day.
Following the San Mateo contest,
the squad will go to work in prepara
tion for the second game of the Cali
, lornia series. The Cards eked out a
3 to I victory over the Bears on No
vember 1 that was closer than the
score would indicate.
U.C. Game Saturday
The second California game will
be played here Saturday, with the
freshmen teams tangling in a pre
liminary.
With the squad in good physical
condition, the Cards are in an ex
cellent position to win the annual
Bear series, with one game already
in the bag.
The final game will be played at
Berkeley the morning of the Big
Game.
