## 
### 
Counting on a largo turn out of
freshman football men interested in
basketball Coach John Bunn is pre
paring for a strenuous season with
his babe hoopslers. Since the be
ginning of the quarter an average
of twenty men has been turning out
for practice on Tuesdays, Thurs
days, and Saturdays.
With the closing of the babe grid
season Bunn is expecting a large
assortment of basketball talent in
cluding David Packard, flashy center
from Pueblo, James Massey of the
freshman football squad, *<nd Her
bert Sanderson, to come out for the
regular daily practice.
Bunn has asked for all basketball
men who have been out for football,
and any other freshmen interested
in basketball to see him as soon as
possible. Daily workouts are to be
gin as soon as possible and the Sat
urday practices are to be eliminated
from the program. The material so
far has made satisfactory progress,
but more men are needed, according
to Bunn.
