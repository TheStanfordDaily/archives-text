# Tony Siano, Fordham's Center and Captain, Will Be Hard Man for Gaels to Stop Saturday
## 
### 
Like Harvard, Fordham Univer
sity last year honored its star center
with the captaincy of the team for
1930. And like Big Ben Ticknor,
little Tony Siano was deserving of
the honor. A battering-ram in hu
man form is this popular Italian from
I the Bronx —a clever, rough and ready
I snapperback, who yields ground to
! no man and who has been in the
thick of every fray since he first
• made the team as a Sophomore.
Fordham did rot lose a game last
' year, you will remember, but had
! two ties to mar its record, and even
| with centers like Ticknor of Harvard
and Heineke of Stanford in the run
ning, Tony Siano received much fa
vorable mention for the All-Ameri
can pivot post.
Now, Siano rhymes with piano,

and like George Walsh, Fordham's
one-time football star who went on
into greater fame in the movies,
Siano can run the scale of human
emotions on the gridiron as well as
Paderewski (no, he doesn't play for
Fordham) can on the ivory keys.
What a little spitfire Signor Tony is!
A combative little giant, hard as
nails, built of whalebone and whip
cord, that's Terrible Tony, leader of
the Rams of Fordham, undefeated
thus far this year.
Major Cavanaugh has built up a
fine machine at the University in
the Bronx, and in Bartos, Murphy,
McMahon and Pieculewicz (there's
a combination for you!) he has a
versatile backfield. It should be an
afternoon of thrills when Fordham
and St. Mary's clash at the Polo
Grounds Saturday.
