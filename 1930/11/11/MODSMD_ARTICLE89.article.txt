### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 10 </P).—Young
lawyers-to-be were advised by Dr.
Edward Lyman Cornell of North
western University medical school
today to choose good secretaries and
then marry them.
A secretary, Dr. Cornell told
Northwestern law students, should
have all the qualities of a good wife,
and so the students would know
what the qualities of a good wife
were, he enumerated them:
"I—Health. Don't marry a girl
who can't run 100 yards close to 13
seconds. Any faster may not be
desirable on some occasions. Much
slower is not a sign of health.
"2—Jealousy. A professional man
cannot afford a jealous secretary or
wife.
"3—Education. College degree pre
ferred.
"4—Social training, tact, good
taste in dress and home manage
ment, and the ability to entertain
are very essential.
"s—Business training. This is most
essential as most professional men
are poor bookkeepers.
"6—Beauty. She should have a
good appearance and be smart
enough to maintain her good looks."
