# HOOVER LEADS NATION TOWARD GOAL OF PEACE
## Horrors Of War Recalled By Armistice Day Celebration TRIBUTE TO VETERANS 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. (/P). â€”
Twelve years after the "cease far
ing" order was passed through the
war-torn trenches of France and
echoed around the world, President
Hoover today led the nation in its
Armistice Day tribute to the living
and dead veterans of the World War
with an appeal for the perpetuation
of world peace.
After placing a wreath of yellow
chrysanthemums upon the plain,
marble tomb of the Unknown Sol
dier at Arlington, the Chief Execu
tive, in an address before the annual
conference and congress
of the World Alliance for Inter
national Friendship through the
Churches, said the war had taught
the blessing of peace, if nothing else.
Urges World Court
Again urging American adherence
to the World Court, he reiterated his
proposal for freedom of the seas for
food supplies in time of war and
forecast possible extension of the
Kellogg-Briand pact for outlawing
war to mobilize world opinion against
its violators.
He held that the time had not yet
come when "we can assume that
righteousness has so advanced in the
world that we may yet have com
plete confidence in the full growth
of pacific means or rest solely upon
the processes of peace for defense.
Good Will Needed
"The purpose of our government,"
he added, "is to co-operate with oth
ers, to use our friendly offices, and,
short of any implication of the use
of force, to use every friendly effort
and all good-will to maintain the
peace of the world."
With flags flying along the streets,
from the many government buildings
and embassies of foreign govern
ments, the national capital donned
its patriotic attire in observance of
the day.
The tomb of Woodrow Wilson in
the National Cathedral received its
annual mete of tribute, too, in addi
tion to the hundreds of persons who
visited the chapel where rests the
body of the war President, a special
service was conducted there.
In addition to the visit of the Presi
dent and Mrs. Hoover, two other
were held at Arlington. The
military chaplains who participated
in the interment of the Unknown
Soldier gathered at his shrine to re
peat portions of the original service.
