# PROFESSOR EMERSON DESCRIBES COMING ENGLISH DEBATE TEAM
## 
### BY J.F. ALLEN 
Concerning the 'International De
bate'' to be held November 17 at
8:15 p. m., in the Assembly Hall,
between Stanford and two English
universities, Professor J. G. Emerson,
Stanford debate coach, said yester
day: "This will be Stanford's firsl
opportunity to entertain a team rep
resentative, in a sense, of all the uni
versities of England."'
"In 1927," continued Emerson, "the
Stanford audience discovered there
was a difference between the Oxford
and Cambridge types of debates. In
this year's team, we may expect, I
think, something of the coustic,
something of the humorous, and a
great deal more of the revelent than
was characteristic of the style of the
Oxford team of last year.'

Robert McClintock, prominent
I Stanford debator, met both the Eng
| lish representatives, D. Hope Ellet
i son, Oxford and B. J. Crchan, Uni
j versity of Liverpool, at debate in
j England last April, according to Em
! erson. "We have McClintock's word
for it,"he concluded, "that both are
! very clever, exceedingly well in
formed, and altogether formidable
opponents."
j The Stanford team, which is to
| uphold the negative of the state
ment: "Resolved, that the principle
jof democracy has been tried and
; found wanting," is composed of Irv-
I ing Rosenblatt, Jr., and George E.
Shibley. Both men have had a good
deal of experience in Stanford de
bating, according to John Pascoe, de
! bate manager.
