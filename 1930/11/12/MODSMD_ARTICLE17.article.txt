# CONCERT HONORS COLLEGE HEROES
## Brahms' "Requiem" Heard By Large Audience 
### Virginia Elston 
In commemoration of Stanford
men and women who gave their
lives during the World War, I
Brahms' "Requiem" was presented
last night before a large and appre
ciative crowd gathered in the Me
morial Church.
The program opened with two or
gan preludes played by Benjamin
S. Moore, organist of Trinity
Church, San Francisco, the first be
ing symbolic of martial heroism and »
the second sounding a note of peace j
and tranquility. A short invocation
was then pronounced by Dr. David
C. Gardner, University chaplain, 1
and the audience was asked to unite i
in a silent prayer for the departed
war heroes.
Brahms' magnificent consolatory
choral for orchestra and choir fol
lowed. "The Requiem" was sung
with great feeling and vividness of 1
expression. Starting with subdued
but deep emotion, the chorus, i
"Blessed are they that mourn," rose I
in volume to an ecstatic outburst
in the second part. The absence of
violins in the first number made the
appearance of the full orchestra |
later more impressive.
The third chorus was notable for !
its skillful blending of bass and mel
ody. The passage, "But the righteous !
souls," was based on a sustained D
in the bass, a revolutionai'y device
which bewildered critics in 1868. i
This pedal-point probably suggested
unwavering faith, while weaving
figures in the voices and orchestra
floated harmoniously above.
Life, death, and immortality were
these themes of the remaining chor
uses. A repetition of the "Comfort"
theme was sounded in the last |
movement, and the final number
was a benediction.
Solo parts included in the Re- j
quiem were sung by Mrs. Violet ,
Cowger and Claude A. Shull. Mrs. j
Cowger's soprano solo depicting the
power of mother-love, reminded one
that the work was written in mem
ory of the composer's mother.
Shull's baritone solos in the third
and sixth parts added strength to
the piece.
No music sung in the Chapel has
aroused more reverent enthusiasm
and rapt attention than the rendi
tion of "The Requiem." It created
an effect that will linger in the
minds of all the listeners.

"Blessed are they that mourn," rose I
in volume to an ecstatic outburst
in the second part. The absence of
violins in the first number made the
appearance of the full orchestra |
later more impressive.
The third chorus was notable for !
its skillful blending of bass and mel
ody. The passage, "But the righteous !
souls," was based on a sustained D
in the bass, a revolutionai'y device
which bewildered critics in 1868. i
This pedal-point probably suggested
unwavering faith, while weaving
figures in the voices and orchestra
floated harmoniously above.
Life, death, and immortality were
these themes of the remaining chor
uses. A repetition of the "Comfort"
theme was sounded in the last |
movement, and the final number
was a benediction.
Solo parts included in the Re- j
quiem were sung by Mrs. Violet ,
Cowger and Claude A. Shull. Mrs. j
Cowger's soprano solo depicting the
power of mother-love, reminded one
that the work was written in mem
ory of the composer's mother.
Shull's baritone solos in the third
and sixth parts added strength to
the piece.
No music sung in the Chapel has
aroused more reverent enthusiasm
and rapt attention than the rendi
tion of "The Requiem." It created
an effect that will linger in the
minds of all the listeners.
In commemoration of Stanford
men and women who gave their
lives during the World War, I
Brahms' "Requiem" was presented
last night before a large and appre
ciative crowd gathered in the Me
morial Church.
The program opened with two or
gan preludes played by Benjamin
S. Moore, organist of Trinity
Church, San Francisco, the first be
ing symbolic of martial heroism and »
the second sounding a note of peace j
and tranquility. A short invocation
was then pronounced by Dr. David
C. Gardner, University chaplain, 1
and the audience was asked to unite i
in a silent prayer for the departed
war heroes.
Brahms' magnificent consolatory
choral for orchestra and choir fol
lowed. "The Requiem" was sung
with great feeling and vividness of 1
expression. Starting with subdued
but deep emotion, the chorus, i
