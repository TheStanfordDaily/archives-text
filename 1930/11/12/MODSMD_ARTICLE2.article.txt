# SIX-WEEK TERM IN SUMMER QUARTER TO BE ELIMINATED
## 
### 
The six-weeks term in the sum
mer quarter has been eliminated,
according to the Registrar's Office.
In 1931 the schools and departments
of the University, except the law
and education schools, will schedule
their courses for the full quarter of
approximately 11 weeks, which is
to begin June 18 and close August
29.
All education classes will be held
for eight weeks, instead of for six
and live weeks, to meet the special
needs of students connected with
other educational institutions. This
term is to begin June 18 and close
August 15. Its purpose is to enable
teachers who must return to their
school duties before the end of Au
gust to receive full credit for the
quarter's work without making spe
cial arrangements for an early de
parture or losing a unit in each sub
ject from which they withdraw.
Summer education classes will
hold extra meetings each week, thus
making it possible for a quarter's
work to be accomplished. No School
oi' Education classes arc planned for
Saturdays.
The School of Law is not affected
by the new plan; it will operate
under the old six- and five-weeks
arrangement.
