# GIBSON STATES AMERICA OPPOSES BUDGET LIMITS AT GENEVA CONFERENCE
## British, Italian Governments Declared to Favor Plan For Armament Limitations as Diplomats Meet in Preparatory Session 
### 
Nov. 11. (/P) —Unalterable opposition to any limita
tion of armaments through a method of budgetary restriction was
announced by Hugh S. Gibson, the Washington representative, at the
session of the preparatory commission on disarmament here today.
Ambassador Gibson's announcement was made in the course of dis
cussion of the budgetary method of limitation, which the British and ,

Italian representatives said their
governments favored, although not
to the exclusion of more direct
methods of limitation.
The American envoy told the
commission that the United States, ,
however, would not object to a
treaty which bound the other pow
ers to limitation by budgetary re
strictions while leaving the United
States free to employ her own sys
tem of limitation.
"The direct limitation of anna- (
ments with full publicity is the most
practicable and useful method of
limitation which exists, we believe,"
the ambassador declared.
Lord Cecil presented the British
viewpoint on the subject, emphasiz
ing the tremendous* importance in
British opinion, of a limit for war
materials. Any future war, he fore
cast, will be fought by small armies |
with high technical equipment.

Befire Gibson's speech today,
Italy's representative, General de
Marinis, and Lord Cecil of Great
Britain outlined their views of what j
they regarded as the vital need for
the limitation of land armaments.
General de Marinis declared that
if the commission desired to obtain
a positive reduction of armaments
it would be necessary to consider
the question of existing stocks of
materials.
'"This," he said, "is a matter which
is disturbing public opinion and it
ought also to disturb the members
of this commission. It would be
unacceptable for us to sign a con- I
vention which ignored existing
stocks of war material which we
consider should be regularized." j
Concludes Speech
In concluding his remarks, he (
said: "I think we should not despair
of reaching an agreement in regard i
to a system which would give the
various states sufficient assurance
and allow us to realize a reduction
of armaments which would be both
just and effective."
He added that while he felt full
publicity would be of much value,
he believed thorough limitation
could not be obtained unless the
governments agreed to budgetary
limitation. This budgetary limitation,
he said, should be employed to com
pare a country's expenditures from
! year to year rather than to compare
one country's expenditure with an- ]
1 other.

announced by Hugh S. Gibson, the Washington representative, at the
session of the preparatory commission on disarmament here today.
Ambassador Gibson's announcement was made in the course of dis
cussion of the budgetary method of limitation, which the British and ,

Italian representatives said their
governments favored, although not
to the exclusion of more direct
methods of limitation.
The American envoy told the
commission that the United States, ,
however, would not object to a
treaty which bound the other pow
ers to limitation by budgetary re
strictions while leaving the United
States free to employ her own sys
tem of limitation.
"The direct limitation of anna- (
ments with full publicity is the most
practicable and useful method of
limitation which exists, we believe,"
the ambassador declared.
Lord Cecil presented the British
viewpoint on the subject, emphasiz
ing the tremendous* importance in
British opinion, of a limit for war
materials. Any future war, he fore
cast, will be fought by small armies |
with high technical equipment.

Befire Gibson's speech today,
Italy's representative, General de
Marinis, and Lord Cecil of Great
Britain outlined their views of what j
they regarded as the vital need for
the limitation of land armaments.
General de Marinis declared that
if the commission desired to obtain
a positive reduction of armaments
it would be necessary to consider
the question of existing stocks of
materials.
'"This," he said, "is a matter which
is disturbing public opinion and it
ought also to disturb the members
of this commission. It would be
unacceptable for us to sign a con- I
vention which ignored existing
stocks of war material which we
consider should be regularized." j
Concludes Speech
In concluding his remarks, he (
said: "I think we should not despair
of reaching an agreement in regard i
to a system which would give the
various states sufficient assurance
and allow us to realize a reduction
of armaments which would be both
just and effective."
He added that while he felt full
publicity would be of much value,
he believed thorough limitation
could not be obtained unless the
governments agreed to budgetary
limitation. This budgetary limitation,
he said, should be employed to com
pare a country's expenditures from
! year to year rather than to compare
one country's expenditure with an- ]
1 other.

tion of armaments through a method of budgetary restriction was
