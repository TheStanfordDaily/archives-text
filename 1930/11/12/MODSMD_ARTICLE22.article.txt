# POLICE DENY THIEF GANG OPERATING ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS
## 
### 
Statements made by San Francisco
newspapers that a gang of auto
thieves are operating on the Stan
ford campus are "misleading and
false.'' according to George Burns,
member of the campus police force.
' There is no gang of thieves. Stu
dents are merely borrowing the
cars, but we will catch them soon,"
Burns said.
Only eight cars have been re
ported missing since the opening of
the quarter and all but one have
been recovered, Burns added. Two
cars were found by the owners. The
balance have been recovered
through the efforts of the campus
police department composed of Fred
Frehe, Gordon Davis, and Burns.
"In every case, the owner of the
missing car left the key in the ma
chine and* in this way practically
invited thievery," concluded Burns.
