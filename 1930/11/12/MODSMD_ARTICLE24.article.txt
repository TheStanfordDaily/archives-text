# WARNER OUSTS PRESS; POINTS FOR BIG GAME
## Revelation Of New Shift Results In Closing Of Field Gates BAN WILL CONTINUE 
### 
Enshrouded in impenetrable scc
recy which barred all representa
tives of the press, the Stanford var
sity gridiron aggregation went
through a short workout yesterday
afternoon behind the board walls of
the practice field as Coach Pop
Warner began the process of point
ing for California's battered Golden
Bears.
The unexpected revelation of
Warner's shift innovation yesterday
decided the Old Fox to take no more
chances on having his machinations
revealed to the eager eyes of enemy
coaches, so his decree that for the
remainder of the season no cor
respondents or other writers would
be admitted to practice was rigidly
enforced yesterday.
Reports Censored
Official, and presumably censored,
reports from the scene of action in
dicated that the workout was one of
the customary order. No scrimmage
was in evidence and the team was
dismissed at 5:45 o'clock, some 15
minutes before the usual time. Run
ning signals and work on the dummy
apparatus occupied the bulk of the
session, with some calesthenics to
top off the day's l exercise.
Warner will probably take his
time about swinging the squad into
full speed for the Big Game, since
the Cal-Tech tilt this Saturday is
hardly tough enough for the Card
mentor to give it any consideration
to speak of. He can move along
easily this week, give his men some
good exercise in the game with the
Engineers, and then open up the
throttle in the final period before
November 22.
No New Injuries
No new injuries were reported
' after yesterday's practice, so, al
though Bill Clark, third-string right
halfback, is in the Palo Alto Hos
pital with a bad cold, the Cards
i should be in good physical condi
tion for the coming games.
There is, however, one fact to con
sider about this "breather" Cal-
Tech contest which fills the gap
between November 8 and Novem
ber 22. Soft games have resulted at-'
times in the past in serious injuries
to important members of the Red
shirt machine. The injury to Bill
Simkins' leg in the West Coast
Army tilt last year is a striking
i example of this fact.
May Be Jinx
Possibly this is because the play
ers take things too easily against
weak opponents and are not suffi
ciently tensed to take the pounding
that goes with any football game, or
maybe it's just a jinx. At any rate
fans of a reflective turn of mind
will cross their fingers Saturday and
pray that some key man doesn't
sprain an ankle or throw his knee
out of joint and so be lost to the
team for the California and Dart
mouth battles,
