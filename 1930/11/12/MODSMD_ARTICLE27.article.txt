# RESPONSIBILITY MUST REST HEAVILY
## 
### 
Rough treatment of students entering the Stanford rooting sec
tion at the W ashington football game last Saturday by members of
the Rally Committee has been reported to The D.ur.v.
According to these complaints several members of the Rally
Committee, feeling the burden of responsibility was resting too
heavily on their shoulders, undertook to hasten the entrance of
rooters into the section.
In hastening the rooters, these particular memliers failed to ob
serve common courtesies, but thrust various students into the section
with such force as to make several almost fall down the stairs.
If these "important" members of the committee persist in taking
advantage of their positions in maltreating fellow students, they
should be compelled to resign.
