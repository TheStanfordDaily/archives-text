HESPERIAN. James I). Hart, Editor.
Winter issue. 193 d. (Ai the Stan
ford Bookstore.)
The second number of the maga
zine, Hesperian, "issued occasion
ally" by James Hart, a Stanford
student, fully lives up to the excel
lent standard set by (he original is
sue last spring.
Its typography and make-up are
distinctive and deserve praise.
Among the contributors are found
such well-known names us Theo
dore Dreiser, Yvor Winters, and
Clarkson Crane. There also appears
'works of two Stanford students,
Henry Ramsey, and Buniclii Ka
gawa. The latter has written per
haps the best poem in the magazine.
Mr. Winter's translations from the
French retain all I he art and beauty
of the original verse. "First and
'Firsts,'" an article by Nathan Van
Patten, will be of much interest to
book collectors. The cover design by
Ray Boynton, noted San Francisco
artist, has strength and beauty of
line.
All in all. Mr. Hart is to be con
gratulated in assembling such a
noteworthy magazine. Hesperian
cannot fail to gain a name for itself.

I AM JONATHAN SCRIVENER. By
Claude Houghton. Simon, Schus
ter. New York. 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Store.)
A strange mixture of philosophy
and mystery, and a fascinating book
from beginning lo end. The mystery
I lies not so much in facts as in the
i solving of the leading character's
personality, Jonathan Scrivener,
himself, who makes his personal ap
pearance only on the final page.
The story is one of the greatest
originality. Scrivener hires a secre-

■ I
tary solely because of a letter. He
places the secretary, whom he has
never seen, in his London apart
ments, and leaves for parts un
known. The secretary meets Scrive
ner's friends, and together they try
to solve the secret of that amazing
i person, who possesses everything
and wants none of it.
"I Am Johnson Scrivener" is
' beautifully written. The character
. sketches and dialogue are remark
ably fine, and while it has all the
attractions of a mystery story, it is
way above the usual run of such
stories in style and content. —N. J.
AROUND THEATRES. By Max
Beerhohin. Alfred A. Knopf
(two volumes). At the Stanford
Bookstore.
Shaw, Nathan, Woolcott have had
! their critical efforts collected at
1 various times and neatly packed be
tween covers. Now the renowned
Mr. Beerbohm comes to print for
the first time outside of the London
Saturday Review, on which journal
he replaced the aforementioned Mr.
Shaw.
Beerbohm slyly snickers at Gorki's
famed play, lauds Shaw quite de
lightfully, Edward Gordon Craig—
to whom the book is, suprisingly
enough, dedicated—finds favor in
his eyes, Bernhardt as "Hamlet"
brings forth gentle mocking and
suggestion that this role is a hoop
through which every eminent actor
| must jump, names "Peter Pan" Bar
| rie's highest rise into "mature im-
I maturity."
All in all a good addition to any
library as record of theatrically
glorious years when, if "Bertha The
Sewing Machine Girl" was a huge
success, so was "Arms and the Man."

I AM JONATHAN SCRIVENER. By
Claude Houghton. Simon, Schus
ter. New York. 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Store.)
A strange mixture of philosophy
and mystery, and a fascinating book
from beginning lo end. The mystery
I lies not so much in facts as in the
i solving of the leading character's
personality, Jonathan Scrivener,
himself, who makes his personal ap
pearance only on the final page.
The story is one of the greatest
originality. Scrivener hires a secre-

■ I
tary solely because of a letter. He
places the secretary, whom he has
never seen, in his London apart
ments, and leaves for parts un
known. The secretary meets Scrive
ner's friends, and together they try
to solve the secret of that amazing
i person, who possesses everything
and wants none of it.
"I Am Johnson Scrivener" is
' beautifully written. The character
. sketches and dialogue are remark
ably fine, and while it has all the
attractions of a mystery story, it is
way above the usual run of such
stories in style and content. —N. J.
AROUND THEATRES. By Max
Beerhohin. Alfred A. Knopf
(two volumes). At the Stanford
Bookstore.
Shaw, Nathan, Woolcott have had
! their critical efforts collected at
1 various times and neatly packed be
tween covers. Now the renowned
Mr. Beerbohm comes to print for
the first time outside of the London
Saturday Review, on which journal
he replaced the aforementioned Mr.
Shaw.
Beerbohm slyly snickers at Gorki's
famed play, lauds Shaw quite de
lightfully, Edward Gordon Craig—
to whom the book is, suprisingly
enough, dedicated—finds favor in
his eyes, Bernhardt as "Hamlet"
brings forth gentle mocking and
suggestion that this role is a hoop
through which every eminent actor
| must jump, names "Peter Pan" Bar
| rie's highest rise into "mature im-
I maturity."
All in all a good addition to any
library as record of theatrically
glorious years when, if "Bertha The
Sewing Machine Girl" was a huge
success, so was "Arms and the Man."
