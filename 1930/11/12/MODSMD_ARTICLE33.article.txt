More and more, every day, things
i seem to be done by remote control,
i Mars throws a platter at his wife,
we have thunder. Someone in
Washington presses a button, and
the inhabitants of the Arabian des
ert have electric power tu do their
i nomading by. Stanford wins a loot
ball game, and Eastern supporters
of Dartmouth get worried. Three
thousand penguins shiver with cold
around the South Pole, and we start
talking about building a bonfire.

And now that we're all so busy
learning things, another little edu
! cational article about the ways of
! the world seems to be appropriate.
The question for consideration
today, is: "Do Stanford Students
Stuff?" or "The Elegy of the
Fried Egg." (Theme Soni* for
this production: "Oh bring hack
my Vit-a-min 15 . . .").
Now that you know what.it is the
i little fried egg tries to say to you,
every morning, you can explain the
yellow spots on your tie as excess
energy—grace notes, maybe.
Seriously, we believe that Stan
ford students as a whole used to
'stuff (It's always wise to fill va
cant spaces, if they're obvious holes,
at least), but that not nearly as
many stuff now as used to. You

i with the lower division.
Time was when there were
more places on campus where
you could j;et food in a hurry,
than now. Lots of the un
accounted-for eaters go tearing
up the highway, or off campus

somewhere, and their eating
checks are not made payable to

Two years ago, the upper and
lower levels of what is now the

i names, the Cellar and the Roost.
You never (or seldom) slept in the
Roost, but the local patrons' maxim
was, "I'm going to eat with the
chickens." Once you'd had a date in
