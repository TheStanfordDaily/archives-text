There is a controversy at present
at the University of Pennsylvania j
as to who is the happiest student. ,
Many will say that the well-rounded
student is the happiest but it is im- 1
possible to be well-rounded at a
modern college. ■
To be well-rounded is to partake
in all the pursuits that college of
fers and that means a party on Fri
day night, with the football team on
Saturday, to chapel Sunday morning
and another party that evening, to
class every morning, practice with !
the team every afternoon.
In the spare time one is to study, I
work on campus publications, debat
ing, dramatics, membership in a few i
clubs, and so on far into the night.
The happy student is the one who
concentrates his activities and be
comes lopsided. He is active in one
and at home in two college pursuies.
"Necking and studying,'" or "foot
ball and studying," or "necking and
publications" are peculiar combina
tions. !
Whenever studying is not part of
Ihe combination, however, the pleas
ure is very sweet but also very short
lived.
At the University of Hawaii ,
classes are held six days a week
and at 7:.'10 o'clock in the
morning.
Yet it would be easier to get up i
at daybreak to the romantic tunes
of an Hawaiian guitar than to be
reudely awakened by the jarring
clang of a New Haven, Conn., alarm
clock at 9 o'clock in America.
What is more with those alluring I
wearers of grass skirts, one day !
away from the classroom would j
more than sulfice for persons of i
average will power.
"Irresponsible Yahooism" is the I
specific charges given by Dean !
Christian Gauss for expelling 42
Princeton men.
Needless to say the Dean is very
specific. Only one might think that
"Yahooism" is bad enough withoul j
tacking on "irresponsible."
