AN OPEN LETTER TO
DINK TEMPI.ETON
Dear Dink:
Last year when you were square
enough to confess that you had
overlooked Chuck Smalling and
Mush Muller and Walt Heinecke in
your All-American'rating, the gen
eral public took great delight io
hopping all over you for your over
sight. Naturally enough, few of them
stopped to realize that they had not
given this trio much consideration
themselves until the U.C. and Army
£?omes, and by that time it was too
late.
Now this is the week of doldrums.
i\s it has been rumored, we play
Lai Tech Saturday. Cal Tech has a
nice team. We have no doubts that
I he men are all gentlemen, that they
play football to the hest of their
thiiity, and that at times they might
•veil light harder than Stanford lias
>ti some occasions. Since there is
ittle to write about, and since we
'eel that this article is pretty safe
icre, we are devoting the space not
0 glowing accounts of the Cal Tech
earn but to a little gab.
Following your articles in the
(advt) and also your
Friday evening sessions with Brick
Vlorse, and seeing you out at pract
ice for the past few weeks, we have
nustered up courage enough to take
his step. We want to call your at
ention to Harlow Rothert, not par
icularly because you need it, but
h cause it helps fill up space.
Now Rothert is a hard-working
,'oung fellow, as you know from
hat "Foot-a-Wcek" moniker he
aught during his sophomore year
>112 shot-putting. Starting out as a
nediocre football player, he has im
>roved beyond recognition until to
lay he stands as one of the finest
>acks Stanford has had, at least in
tur opinion.
In the various write-ups it has
joen our fortune to contribute to
he Daily, the names of Moft'att,
Simkins, Hillman, Taylor, et
•etera, have come in for their share
if praise, as well as lhat of Rothert.
3lit Harlow is deserving of a boost,
le has kept Billy Simkins on the
jench, and that is enough in itself.
As Brick Morse is wont to say,
larlow can kick and he can pass
mil he can run with the ball. We
liink, and there are a few who will
igree, that he is the best punter on
he Coast this year. Ask the Wash
ngton safety man what he thought
bout it, too. Hut they say that Har
ow lacks drive—he does not hit the
ine like Smalling and Nevcrs did.
Much as we dislike it, we must
dmit the truth of the assertion. But
larlow picks his holes, he runs with
lis head up once through the line
112 scrimmage, and he picks up
ardage when it is needed. Stanford
as yet to lose the ball on downs
•'(.cause Rothert fell short on the
nal plunge.
And Rothert is the fastest man
tan ford has ever had in the back
niihack position. Those runs made
1 the Santa Clara and U.C.L.A.
amcs, and the rest of the tilts tes
fy to his elusiveness as well as to
is speed. lie sidesteps tacklers in
le open field, and goes on to pick
p another ten yards instead of
riving into the tackier to gain two
aids.
Versatility is the keynote of this
id's work. You see him at fullback,
ou see him at left halfback, you
»e him toss passes, you see him
itch passes. Aerial defense? How
lany throws have been completed
ver his head? How many has he
itercepted? He kicks ofl, he kicks
)als, he kicks out of bounds within
io 15-yard line.
. there anything Rothert docs not
:i? To date, he has been the vital
lark-plug in the majority of the
lines Stanford has played. Cali
•rnia and Dartmouth arc coming
p. and the outstanding men in

these contests will be hailed as
heroes. We are going on record now
as predicting that he will be one
of those inevitable creatures when
the season is over. And so wc have
sung the praises of one member of
the football team to. the exclusion
of the others, a bad practice; we
have filled up another galley of type;
and we hope that you will remember
Rothert when you write that fatal
recommendation to Grantland Rice.
Hopefully, 1,. K., Jr.

AN OPEN LETTER TO
DINK TEMPI.ETON
Dear Dink:
Last year when you were square
enough to confess that you had
overlooked Chuck Smalling and
Mush Muller and Walt Heinecke in
your All-American'rating, the gen
eral public took great delight io
hopping all over you for your over
sight. Naturally enough, few of them
stopped to realize that they had not
given this trio much consideration
themselves until the U.C. and Army
£?omes, and by that time it was too
late.
Now this is the week of doldrums.
i\s it has been rumored, we play
Lai Tech Saturday. Cal Tech has a
nice team. We have no doubts that
I he men are all gentlemen, that they
play football to the hest of their
thiiity, and that at times they might
•veil light harder than Stanford lias
>ti some occasions. Since there is
ittle to write about, and since we
'eel that this article is pretty safe
icre, we are devoting the space not
0 glowing accounts of the Cal Tech
earn but to a little gab.
Following your articles in the
(advt) and also your
Friday evening sessions with Brick
Vlorse, and seeing you out at pract
ice for the past few weeks, we have
nustered up courage enough to take
his step. We want to call your at
ention to Harlow Rothert, not par
icularly because you need it, but
h cause it helps fill up space.
Now Rothert is a hard-working
,'oung fellow, as you know from
hat "Foot-a-Wcek" moniker he
aught during his sophomore year
>112 shot-putting. Starting out as a
nediocre football player, he has im
>roved beyond recognition until to
lay he stands as one of the finest
>acks Stanford has had, at least in
tur opinion.
In the various write-ups it has
joen our fortune to contribute to
he Daily, the names of Moft'att,
Simkins, Hillman, Taylor, et
•etera, have come in for their share
if praise, as well as lhat of Rothert.
3lit Harlow is deserving of a boost,
le has kept Billy Simkins on the
jench, and that is enough in itself.
As Brick Morse is wont to say,
larlow can kick and he can pass
mil he can run with the ball. We
liink, and there are a few who will
igree, that he is the best punter on
he Coast this year. Ask the Wash
ngton safety man what he thought
bout it, too. Hut they say that Har
ow lacks drive—he does not hit the
ine like Smalling and Nevcrs did.
Much as we dislike it, we must
dmit the truth of the assertion. But
larlow picks his holes, he runs with
lis head up once through the line
112 scrimmage, and he picks up
ardage when it is needed. Stanford
as yet to lose the ball on downs
•'(.cause Rothert fell short on the
nal plunge.
And Rothert is the fastest man
tan ford has ever had in the back
niihack position. Those runs made
1 the Santa Clara and U.C.L.A.
amcs, and the rest of the tilts tes
fy to his elusiveness as well as to
is speed. lie sidesteps tacklers in
le open field, and goes on to pick
p another ten yards instead of
riving into the tackier to gain two
aids.
Versatility is the keynote of this
id's work. You see him at fullback,
ou see him at left halfback, you
»e him toss passes, you see him
itch passes. Aerial defense? How
lany throws have been completed
ver his head? How many has he
itercepted? He kicks ofl, he kicks
)als, he kicks out of bounds within
io 15-yard line.
. there anything Rothert docs not
:i? To date, he has been the vital
lark-plug in the majority of the
lines Stanford has played. Cali
•rnia and Dartmouth arc coming
p. and the outstanding men in

these contests will be hailed as
heroes. We are going on record now
as predicting that he will be one
of those inevitable creatures when
the season is over. And so wc have
sung the praises of one member of
the football team to. the exclusion
of the others, a bad practice; we

AN OPEN LETTER TO
DINK TEMPI.ETON
Dear Dink:
Last year when you were square
enough to confess that you had
overlooked Chuck Smalling and
Mush Muller and Walt Heinecke in
your All-American'rating, the gen
eral public took great delight io
hopping all over you for your over
sight. Naturally enough, few of them
stopped to realize that they had not
given this trio much consideration
themselves until the U.C. and Army
£?omes, and by that time it was too
late.
Now this is the week of doldrums.
i\s it has been rumored, we play
Lai Tech Saturday. Cal Tech has a
nice team. We have no doubts that
I he men are all gentlemen, that they
play football to the hest of their
thiiity, and that at times they might
•veil light harder than Stanford lias
>ti some occasions. Since there is
ittle to write about, and since we
'eel that this article is pretty safe
icre, we are devoting the space not
0 glowing accounts of the Cal Tech
earn but to a little gab.
Following your articles in the
(advt) and also your
Friday evening sessions with Brick
Vlorse, and seeing you out at pract
ice for the past few weeks, we have
nustered up courage enough to take
his step. We want to call your at
ention to Harlow Rothert, not par
icularly because you need it, but
h cause it helps fill up space.
Now Rothert is a hard-working
,'oung fellow, as you know from
hat "Foot-a-Wcek" moniker he
aught during his sophomore year
>112 shot-putting. Starting out as a
nediocre football player, he has im
>roved beyond recognition until to
lay he stands as one of the finest
>acks Stanford has had, at least in
tur opinion.
In the various write-ups it has
joen our fortune to contribute to
he Daily, the names of Moft'att,
Simkins, Hillman, Taylor, et
•etera, have come in for their share
if praise, as well as lhat of Rothert.
3lit Harlow is deserving of a boost,
le has kept Billy Simkins on the
jench, and that is enough in itself.
As Brick Morse is wont to say,
larlow can kick and he can pass
mil he can run with the ball. We
liink, and there are a few who will
igree, that he is the best punter on
he Coast this year. Ask the Wash
ngton safety man what he thought
bout it, too. Hut they say that Har
ow lacks drive—he does not hit the
ine like Smalling and Nevcrs did.
Much as we dislike it, we must
dmit the truth of the assertion. But
larlow picks his holes, he runs with
lis head up once through the line
112 scrimmage, and he picks up
ardage when it is needed. Stanford
as yet to lose the ball on downs
•'(.cause Rothert fell short on the
nal plunge.
And Rothert is the fastest man
tan ford has ever had in the back
niihack position. Those runs made
1 the Santa Clara and U.C.L.A.
amcs, and the rest of the tilts tes
fy to his elusiveness as well as to
is speed. lie sidesteps tacklers in
le open field, and goes on to pick
p another ten yards instead of
riving into the tackier to gain two
aids.
Versatility is the keynote of this
id's work. You see him at fullback,
ou see him at left halfback, you
»e him toss passes, you see him
itch passes. Aerial defense? How
lany throws have been completed
ver his head? How many has he
itercepted? He kicks ofl, he kicks
)als, he kicks out of bounds within
io 15-yard line.
