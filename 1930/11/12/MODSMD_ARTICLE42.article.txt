# Sigma Nu, El Toro Tied For Lead In League 3
## OVERHEAD ATTACK CARRIES EL TORO TO 21-0 TRIUMPH Japanese Club Defeated By Sequoia I! In League IV Supremacy Race 
### 
El Toro's powerful and deceptive
passing attack, featuring Vard
Loomis, carried them to a 21-0 vic
tory over El Tigre and into a tie
for leadership of League 111 with
Sigma Nu yesterday afternoon.
Winning their third consecutive
game, Sequoia II overwhelmed the
Japanese Club 14-0 to go into the
van of League IV. Two sneak passes
over center to Wrenn, who then
carried the ball into scoring position,
gave the hallmen their scores.
Every try for point after touch
downs in this game and in the El
Toro-El Tigre battle was successful.
Brown of Sequoia drop-kicked two
for his team while short, disguised
passes counted three extra points
for El Toro.
The other game scheduled for the
day was not played, the S.A.E.'s and
the Delta Chi's postponing their
contest till Friday. A.T.O. had drawn
a bye as the result of dropping the
Chi Psi's from the tournament.
Cames scheduled for tomorrow
are:
Sigma Chi vs. Breakers on field
one.
Phi Kappa Sigma vs. Los Arcos
on field two.
Theta Chi vs. Delta Upsilon on
fields three.
Theta Delta Chi vs. Beta Theta Pi
on field four.
