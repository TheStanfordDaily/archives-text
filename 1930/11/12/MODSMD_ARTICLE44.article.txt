# WHY PRINCETON MOURNS
## The 						Ferocious Tiger, Once Terror of the East, Scores But One Touchdown in Four Major Games 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Those who have read Big Bill Ed- '
wards'."Football Days" will wonder
what has happened to Princeton.
And those who have been to Prince
ton, played for Princeton, or seen
Princeton teams play in the heyday
of her glory are also wondering.
What has happened to the ferocious
Tiger that once defended the Orange
and Black of Old Nassau? Where are
the Slagles, Ameses, Moffatts, Co
wans, Hillebrands, Cochrans, De-
Witts, Poes, Bleuthenthals, Harts,
and Dillons of other years?
In the old days Princeton was
surfeited with stellar grid material,
now a real football player on the
Tiger campus is as scarce as a col
lege team rushing to the front to
offer to play a post-season game for
charity.
Look at Princeton's record for
1930! Yes indeed, just lock at it!
Only one touchdown scored in four |
games against Brown, Cornell, Navy, [
and Chicago! And Yale to come! i
And what nightmare 31 to 0 defeat i

i at the hands of the Navy, a team
that had been beaten by little Duke
University! "Oh well, Princeton
teams always are weak in October,
and fight their best against their
November opponents." But look at
the Tigers' November opponents!
Chicago, Lehigh, and Yale! One
more big game, while Notre Dame
has yet to meet Drake, Northwest
ern, Army, and U.S.C. (glimpse a
real schedule). Roper, an inspira
tional coach above all things, appar
ently has weak material and a team
weak in the fundamentals of foot
ball.
What a valedictory! Not a major
game won in his last two seasons!
The Tigers' record against Yale and
Harvard, since the war, is exception
ally good, however. In eight games
with the Crimson, 1919-1926, the
Orange and Black has lost only one
and tied two. And in the three years
j 1924-1926 Princeton ran up 82 points
[to Harvard's 0! Against Yale, the
! Tiger has won six and lost five
I since the war.

University! "Oh well, Princeton
teams always are weak in October,
and fight their best against their
November opponents." But look at
the Tigers' November opponents!
Chicago, Lehigh, and Yale! One
more big game, while Notre Dame
has yet to meet Drake, Northwest
ern, Army, and U.S.C. (glimpse a
real schedule). Roper, an inspira
tional coach above all things, appar
ently has weak material and a team
weak in the fundamentals of foot
ball.
What a valedictory! Not a major
game won in his last two seasons!
The Tigers' record against Yale and
Harvard, since the war, is exception
ally good, however. In eight games
with the Crimson, 1919-1926, the
Orange and Black has lost only one
and tied two. And in the three years
j 1924-1926 Princeton ran up 82 points
[to Harvard's 0! Against Yale, the
! Tiger has won six and lost five
I since the war.

Those who have read Big Bill Ed- '
wards'."Football Days" will wonder
what has happened to Princeton.
And those who have been to Prince
ton, played for Princeton, or seen
Princeton teams play in the heyday
of her glory are also wondering.
What has happened to the ferocious
Tiger that once defended the Orange
and Black of Old Nassau? Where are
the Slagles, Ameses, Moffatts, Co
wans, Hillebrands, Cochrans, De-
Witts, Poes, Bleuthenthals, Harts,
and Dillons of other years?
In the old days Princeton was
surfeited with stellar grid material,
now a real football player on the
Tiger campus is as scarce as a col
lege team rushing to the front to
offer to play a post-season game for
charity.
Look at Princeton's record for
1930! Yes indeed, just lock at it!
Only one touchdown scored in four |
games against Brown, Cornell, Navy, [
and Chicago! And Yale to come! i
And what nightmare 31 to 0 defeat i

i at the hands of the Navy, a team
that had been beaten by little Duke
