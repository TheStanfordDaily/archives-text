# RACQUET MEN TO BATTLE IN FIRST FALL TOURNAMENT
## Coach Ragan Schedules New Inter-Squad Competition 
### 
For the first time in the history of
varsity tennis here, a fall tourna
ment will be played, according to
Coach Frank Ragan. The matches
will begin the latter part of this
week, and if possible the tournament
will become an annual event.
Ragan plans to line up about
eighteen men for the tilts, which
will decide the singles and doubles
champions of the University. There
will be eight doubles teams striving
for the championship.
With such men as Keith Gledhill,
Captain Ted Easton, Harry Plymire,
Joe Coughlin, Chuck Weisner, and
Russel Robinson competing, Ragan
is confident of plenty of competition
and brilliant play.
Gledhill showed surprisingly fine
form, for this time of year, last
Thursday when he defeated Gerald
Stratford, former U.C. player, for
mer California state champion, for
former national intercollegiate
champion, 6-0, 7-5.
Captain Easton did not play in
last week's exhibition matches but
fans will have an opportunity to see
what sort of form he is in during
the tournament this week.
Ragan's purpose in staging the
tournament is to give the men
something to work for and to sus
tain the interest and incentive for
hard work on the courts this quar
ter.
However, another important rea
son for the matches, according to
Ragan, is to determine the ability of
the men as displayed against col
lege competition. Several exhibition
matches have been played this
quarter,but those were against men
who, for the most part, are unable
to train regularly. Also the back
ground of the courts here, and the
fastness of the courts compared with
courts elsewhere, handicaps players
not accustomed to them. A tourna
ment among the members of the
squad will be on an absolutely even
basis—the results depending upon
skill alone.
