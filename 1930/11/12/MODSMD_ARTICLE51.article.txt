# COACH EXPECTS GRAYS TO DEFEAT CALIFORNIA IN SEASON'S ONLY GAME
## 
### 
I Coach Murray Cuddeback is look
! ing forward to a win for his Grays
J when they tangle at Berkeley next
i Saturday with the 'Blue and Gold
; football squad in their only game of
1 the season. Although the Card
Goofs have been handicapped dur
ing the season. by lack of a definite
i objective and injuries to some of
, their best men, Cuddeback expects
them to play " their best football
, against the California squad, which
has shown poor form in their scrim- i
mage with the varsity.
Cuddeback and Robesky are de
i pending chiefly on their backfield, !
| which they consider as strong as i
1 last year's. Afflerbaugh, first-string j
: halfback, displayed considerable
carrying power in the scrimmage j
Monday against the varsity third j
string. [

The coaches are not so enthusias
tic about the line which they con
sider weaker than that of last year's
Gray team which downed the Cali
fornia Goofs in a walkaway. Corbus,
firstrstrjng guard, considered the
best linesman on the team, has been
put out of the game for the entire
season by a broken collar bone re
ceived in scrimmage earlier in the
season.
Saturday's game marks the,end of
the season for the Grays. Accord
ing to Cuddeback a more definite
schedule with an out-of-town game
would arouse more enthusiasm in
the team. This year it was first an
nounced that there would be two
games, one at Berkeley and one
which was undecided. Plans for the
second match were later dropped
with the result that the turnout was
not up to expectations.
