# COACH SMITH HOLDS LIGHT WORKOUT FOR VARSITY SOCCERITES
## 
### 
Assistant Coach Ward Smith pol
; ished off the varsity soccer squad
yesterday afternoon with a light
practice in preparation for their re
turn game with San Mateo Junior
College at San Mateo this afternoon.
The team worked smoothly
against the frosh, and seems to be
ready to atone for their 2 to 1 loss
to the junior collcgians last month.
At the time of the first encounter, ,

the Cardinals had had but little
practice, while the San Mateans
were in mid-season form. An addi
tional month's work and perfection
of scoring punch makes the Cards
favorites today.
One factor may prove a handicap
to Stanford. The fray will take place
on the San Mateo high school dirt
field, while the Cards ai*e used to
turf.
Smith has announced the follow
ing starting lineup: Webster, guard;
Dalton and Burns, fullbacks; Chris
tensen, Jackson, and Plumb, half
backs; Nichols, Fallc, Miller, Captain
Eberhardt, and Reynolds, forwards.
