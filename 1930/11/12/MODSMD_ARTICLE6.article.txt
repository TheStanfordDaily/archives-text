# VOLUMES, MONEY GIVEN TO LIBRARY BY ENGLISH CLUB
## 
### 
"Poems by a Gentleman of Vir
ginia," Donne's "Biathanatos," Poems
by Thomas Warton the elder, T.M.."
"A Discourse on Trade," and Henry
Moro's "Virtue"—the first five vol
umes from the Facsimile Text Asso
ciation—were presented recently to
the Library by the English Club.
The club also has given $125 to
the library fund of the English de
partment, as well as investing $<>0
in a savings deposit which it intends
to increase annually by a like
amount.
For several years past the English
Club has been contributing books to
the library. This year it was felt
that the library needed assistance in
actual money, and acting upon this
idea the club made every effort to
collect funds for the purchase of
books ordered by the English de
partment. An appeal to the alumni
members of the club brought grati
fying results, and the undergradu
ate members have exerted them
selves this quarter to augment the
sum.
According to Victor* L.PPicke ts,
chairman of the book committee for
the English Club, there can be no
positive assurance that these gifts
will be duplicated exactly each
year, but it is the club's hope that
this will be the case.
