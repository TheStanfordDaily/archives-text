Why your druggist
should be a pharmacist!
A REGISTERED LICENTIATE PHARMA
CIST is responsible for the acts of an assist
ant who works under him. An Assistant
may or may not be as careful, reliable and
conscientious in his work as a Licentiate.
The Assis+ant lacks the training, experience
and skill of the Licentiate to whom he is re
sponsible. The law permits an Assistant to
be left alone in a Store several hours during
the day, if a Licentiate is within call.
At Our Store, Three Registered Licentiates
are at your service. Each one calls into serv
ice each day of the year his conscientious
care, his sympathy and dependability, and
his pharmaceutical skill and training. Each
man is himself responsible to you and capa
ble of properly filling your Doctor's Prescrip
tions.
