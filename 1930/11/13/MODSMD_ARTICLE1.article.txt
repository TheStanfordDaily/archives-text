# BEAR STUDENT LEADERS VOTE FAITH IN PRICE
## Rumor Hanley And Zuppke Approached To Replace California Coach EDITOR WANTS ACTION 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 12. (PIP) —Full
confidence in Coach C. M. "Nibs"
Price and the football team was
voted by the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students of the
University of California last night.
This vote of confidence came in
contradiction to rumors on the
Berkeley campus that two coaches
of the Big Ten Conference —Dick
Hanley of Northwestern and Bob
Zuppke of Illinois—had been ap
proached or would be approached
to take over the berth of head foot
ball coach.
Objections Discussed
The action of the Executive Com
mittee was announced after a lew
minuts of private discussion, dur
ing which questions concerning the
athletic situation at California raised
by Arthur Arlett, editor of the
Daily Californian, in Monday's is
sue were discussed.
Arlett's article demanded a sweep
ing investigation of the athletic
situation at California, including the
football coaching department. It
followed California's 74-0 defeat
last Saturday by Southern Cali
fornia.
Coach-Hunting Rumored
While confirmation was not forth
coming, it was reported today that
prominent alumni of California had
been busy making overtures to
coaches, Hanley and Zuppke being
the most prominently mentioned.
Although Price's contract has a
year to run, much discussion has
been heard as to ways and means
of disposing of it. Editor Arlett
continued his demands today for an
investigation of the entire athletic
situation at California.
He urged immediate action, de
claring in an editorial: "If the task
is to be done, it should be done now.
There' are those who think quite
seriously that nothing should have
been, said until after the Big Game
was finished. Knowing the task that
faces "Nibs" Price in getting the
team ready for Stanford, they feel
we have overstepped the mark, and
that poor sportsmanship overruled
our better sense.
Urges Action Now
"That kind of reasoning never
would get the job done. Past ex
perience has proved that once a Big
Graine is over, there is an immedi
.le tendency to let the dead past
bury its dead.
"If California wins, everything is
fine. If she loses, people are disap
pointed for a short while, then for
give and forget, and 'Wait Till Next
Year' becomes the theme song. This
> - ear that cannot happen.

While confirmation was not forth
coming, it was reported today that
prominent alumni of California had
been busy making overtures to
coaches, Hanley and Zuppke being
the most prominently mentioned.
Although Price's contract has a
year to run, much discussion has
been heard as to ways and means
of disposing of it. Editor Arlett
continued his demands today for an
investigation of the entire athletic
situation at California.
He urged immediate action, de
claring in an editorial: "If the task
is to be done, it should be done now.
There' are those who think quite
seriously that nothing should have
been, said until after the Big Game
was finished. Knowing the task that
faces "Nibs" Price in getting the
team ready for Stanford, they feel
we have overstepped the mark, and
that poor sportsmanship overruled
our better sense.

fine. If she loses, people are disap
