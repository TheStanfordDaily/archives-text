# POP DEVOTES GRID PRACTICE TO EXPERIMENT
## Simkins, McLeod Work With First String In Scrimmage 
### Stewart Crawford 
While just what was going on be
hind the closed gates of the varsity
grid lot last night remained a mys
tery to the world in general and
newspaper men in particular, official
word indicated that Pop did a little
experimenting with his warriors.
Putting the Redshirts through
their first scrimmage of the week in
preparation for the much-ridden
Golden Bear, the Old Fox had Mc-
Leod working at center and Simkins
in the fullback berth. Through 40
minutes of scrimmage, Warner tried
a little of th\; tmd that, though the
workout against a mixed team of
second- and third-string men didn't
find any of the varsity gridders tak
ing too many chances on being in
jured. Bardin, having just under
gone a minor operation, was not in
a suit.
"Finds" Play
The Cal Tech game Saturday
promises a little more interest this
year than the usual annual set-up,
since the Engineers this season boast
one of the best outfits in their grid
history. However, judging from the
rush to grab all the possible high
score to 0 marks in the Eneina
barber shop score-guessing contest,
fans seem to be anticipating a repe
tition of last year's listless affair.
Since it is probable that Warner's
second- and third-string warriors
will do most of the cavorting Sat
urday, some of the recent "finds"
will be given a chance to show their
wares. Tyler, of basketball fame,
should see some action in the wing
berth, while Marks will undoubted
ly perform at the center position.
Engineers Light
Though the Tech outfit was
smeared by U.C.L.A. to the tune of
30 to 0, with second- and third
string Bruins doing most of the
smearing, the Engineers stand at the
top of their conference. Considering
the weight of their squad, they have
done well for the alma mater even
though they play a minor league
schedule.
With a line averaging around 160,
Shuler, tackle, is the heaviest man
on the team at 180 pounds. Inci
dentally, he is the son of "Fighting
Bob" Shuler, and if he can bother
Warner's reverses in the manner
that his father bothers Los Angeles
politicians, fans may be rewarded
for climbing the Stadium stairs.
