NEW YORK, Nov. 12. (/P). â€”
Charles Bransky was driving his
taxicab through Eighth Avenue
today when he heard a crash be
hind him. He looked.
A negro was on the floor, try
ing to pick himself up.
"Where did you come from?"
Bransky exclaimed.
The occupant of the taxi
pointed a finger upward. There
was a big hole in the roof of the
cab.
Bransky drove his unbidden
fare to a hospital. In a moment
of consciousness he identified
himself as Andrew Stonp, a win
dow cleaner. He had fallen three
stories into the machine.
Physicians said he would re
cover.
