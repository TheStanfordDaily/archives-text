Editor's note: This is the first of a series of dispatches from Ernest Whipple, field
secretary to Boom Drum. Stanford '95, who is exploring the majestic wastes to amuse
himself. Boom was the founder of the Rally Committee, which received the following
message yesterday:

fJOBI DESERT, Nov 12. (Special)— Well, sir, at last Stanford is Ihe proud
possessor of an Indian drum all its own, and appropriately enough it
was none other than that grand old alumnus, Mr. Room Drum, that
discovered it buried under a pile of dirty socks here in the mysterious
wastes of the magical Gobi Desert.
As you know, our gay little expedition to the Gobi Desert left from
Nantucket nearly a year ago to putter around with a lot of senseless
bones out in these wastes. The C.R.D.E.T.D.8.1.G.D. ("The Commodore
Room Drum Expedition to Discover Rones in the Gobi Desert") up until
today had met with litils success. In the meantime the Scotch is running
low and the rainy weather is setting in. So we were all discouraged until
this morning when Mr. Drum made his startling discovery.
Mr. Drum was at the time turning the first spadeful of dirt for the
Gobi Desert "Putt-Putt" Miniature Golf Course which is to be constructed
here, and without warning slipped headlong into the excavation. We
were ready to play a prank and cover him with sand when he un
expectedly appeared holding a huge drum and a pair of dirty socks. The
socks were immediately discarded and we proceeded to examine our "find."
The drum looks like any sort of a drum that you might dig up. Per
sonally I think it's too dirty to monkey with but Mr. Drum was quite
excited.
"It's the war drum of the Stanford Indian," he shouted. "I'm going to
send it to Palo Alto in time for the Big Game Rally. They will beat it a
hundred times and woe be unto California, for the Cardinal shall score
one hundred points. Scalp the Rear."

send it to Palo Alto in time for the Big Game Rally. They will beat it a
hundred times and woe be unto California, for the Cardinal shall score
one hundred points. Scalp the Rear."
