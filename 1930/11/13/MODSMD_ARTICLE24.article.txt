with the total liabilities as amounting to $804,487.62, an auditor's examina

additions to the present athletic
equipment.
From these reserves there is to
be spent $198,509.18 for the comple
tion of the new women's gymna

course clubhouse; $2,578.18 for the
completion of the new sunken base -

In addition the board has yet to
pay $330,970.73 on its note covering
the construction costs of Branner
Hall. There is also a balance of
$75,000 applicable to the board's ac
counts for the next five years.
The board's assets consist princi
pally of cash deposits in banks to
talling $214,752.61 with notes and
accounts receivable making up the
rest of the balance, it was revealed.
With the announcement of the
deficit, the board speaking through
Acting-Chairman Fuller, declared it
was endeavoring to reduce the
shortage by approximately $100,000
during the present fiscal year. This
reduction will take place in antici
pation of actual income during the
year.
The board plans a future reduc
tion of operating expenses also.
May Curtail Program
Fuller declared the board was
facing two problems in the present
financial situation. He said it wat
considering whether to reduce the
deficit more rapidly than has al
l'eady been planned or whether to
extend the present building program
and allow the present deficit to
continue.
Chances of the deficit being ma
terially reduced are dependent on
postponement of the building pro
gram during the next 12 months.
