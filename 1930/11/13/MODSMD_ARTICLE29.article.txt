# ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR THE WOMEN
## 
### 
Noble and row women are again discussing the question of
whether or not row sponsors should remain in the hall through the
winter quarter instead of returning«to their houses at the end of the
autumn quarter. The feeling of the sororities on the matter will
he brought to next meeting of I 'an-1 lellenie, since the
permission of that body is necessary to ]4iU over this experiment.
I he problem has come up before the sponsor group in the past,
but no definite action has ever been taken early enough in the year
to make it feasible. The report of last year's sponsors recommends
a second quarter in koble, and the present group will decide the
question for itself at the end of the quarter, providing I'an-1 lellenie
votes to leave the matter in their hands.
Since the purpose and function of sponsors is to help new
women students over the difficulties of adjustment, it would seem
that the need for them would be very real during rushing and the
post-rushing chaos. That row sponsors would influence freshmen
in their choices of houses is possible but improbable. The six
sorority women living in Koble now are there as A.W'.S. sponsors
primarily, and as such may be expected to act fairly and uprightly.
At any rate, there is no proof that their remaining in the hall
would be unwise, for the experiment has never been tried. This,
being a year of innovations for the hive Hundred, is the best time
to give the idea the trial that it deserves.
