# THE 						UTOPIAN CUTS
## 
### 
lor the edific.ition of those who do not know what cuts are, the
following definition may be advanced: Cuts are a concession made
by the I niversity to the student, whereby that student niav avoid
ihe necessity of attending class in the morning after a heavy night.
They are also a means of leaving the professor to cast his pearls
before others in the class, while one probes the infinite in the seclu
sion of some campus sweet shop, with sympathetic company.
Oftimes, the professor, finding himself unable to recognize and
sanction the student's humanitarian attitude in cutting a class, sees
In to send this really deserving student to the offices of the \dtnin
istration for reasons administrative. Hut this, to any cutter, is an
obstacle that is easily overcome. ()ne needs only a vcrv good doctor
friend, and then one can start all over again.
It is surprising to learn that in some classes, cutting is not al
lowed. ()ur sympathy ?;ocs out to those poor unfortunates who must
attend class every day, and have no opportunity for relief from the
babblings of their professor. If it might only be so arranged that
one might have all the cuts lie desired ; and what a relief it would
be to the Iwnighted instructors. ]fiunr.rnta Daily.
