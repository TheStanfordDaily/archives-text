MOBY DICK. At the New Stanford
Theatre.
I The thing to do with "Moby Dick"
is to compare it with its silent pre-
I decessor, "The Sea Beast," which
also stars the gallant John Barry
more. Both were taken from the
well-known Herman Melville classic,
both present the adventurous story
well, and both have fake whales.
The newer production does not
have the pretentiousness of the si
lent version, but it makes up for it
j in that it gives us Barrymore con
voce. Joan Bennett ably replaces
Dolores Costello in the leading
, feminine role; Barrymore is just as
fiery, and there are some thrilling
scenes, especially just after the
white whale has "gotten" Barry -
| more.
Warner Brothers had to have a
whale, and whales don't make good
actors, strangely enough, so they
have a big rubber thing that is
pretty funny. Don't let that stop
i you, however. —J. T.
THE DEEPENING STREAM. By
Dorothy C'anfield. Harcourt,
Brace. New York. lfJ.'M). ("At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"The Deepening Stream" is the
life of Matey Gilbert, struggling
through childhood against influences
| which she could not understand,
gaining a strength that simplified
life and its values to give her a
"second wind" after 'living in France
during the war.
The book opens with Matey as a
- child in France, the daughter of an
American college professor on sab
batical leave. It is a difficult intro
duction. Subtle implications, hidden
in short episodes which are neces

j sary to the greater part of the
book, are hard to understand a!
first. When Matey grows up and
turns to her families' old village ol
Rustdorf, her real life begins, and
| the herself grrdually understands
! those early episodes.
| Although it is in no sense a war
novel, Dorothy Canfield, in taking
; her characters to France in 1914,
i gives a more vivid, a more actual
! sonse of war than is gained in books
I devoted purely to that subject.
Those who have read '"The Bent
Twig" and "Home Fires in France"
I will find the best of those books
| united in the story of the life of
; Matey Gilbert. —J. N.
OLD ENGLISH. At the Varsity
Theatre.
The screen version of John Gals
; worthy's play, which was brought
:to American theatrical fame by
George Arliss, is in eyery way as
good, if not better, than the stage
production, according to individual
preferences of stage to screen, or
; vice versa. ~
As on the stage, George Arliss is
undoubtedly the only actor who
I could make a success of "Old Eng
lish" on the screen. He lives the
character until one believes that he
must be that character in private
life.
The dramatic glimpse at the close
i of the life of a brave, defiant old
' man who typifies the just-passed
generation of Englishmen is grip
ping. Wo want him to swindle the
stockholders, to provide for his
grandchildren. We look on him as
one who had the courage to finish
what he started and finish it well.

The screen version of John Gals
; worthy's play, which was brought

George Arliss, is in eyery way as
good, if not better, than the stage
production, according to individual
preferences of stage to screen, or
; vice versa. ~
As on the stage, George Arliss is
undoubtedly the only actor who
I could make a success of "Old Eng
lish" on the screen. He lives the
character until one believes that he
must be that character in private
life.
The dramatic glimpse at the close
i of the life of a brave, defiant old

MOBY DICK. At the New Stanford
Theatre.
I The thing to do with "Moby Dick"
is to compare it with its silent pre-
I decessor, "The Sea Beast," which
also stars the gallant John Barry
more. Both were taken from the
well-known Herman Melville classic,
both present the adventurous story
well, and both have fake whales.
The newer production does not
have the pretentiousness of the si
lent version, but it makes up for it
j in that it gives us Barrymore con
voce. Joan Bennett ably replaces
Dolores Costello in the leading
, feminine role; Barrymore is just as
fiery, and there are some thrilling
scenes, especially just after the
white whale has "gotten" Barry -
| more.
Warner Brothers had to have a
whale, and whales don't make good
actors, strangely enough, so they
have a big rubber thing that is
pretty funny. Don't let that stop
i you, however. —J. T.
THE DEEPENING STREAM. By
Dorothy C'anfield. Harcourt,
Brace. New York. lfJ.'M). ("At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"The Deepening Stream" is the
life of Matey Gilbert, struggling
through childhood against influences
| which she could not understand,
gaining a strength that simplified
life and its values to give her a
"second wind" after 'living in France
during the war.
The book opens with Matey as a
- child in France, the daughter of an
American college professor on sab
batical leave. It is a difficult intro
duction. Subtle implications, hidden
in short episodes which are neces

j sary to the greater part of the
book, are hard to understand a!
first. When Matey grows up and
turns to her families' old village ol
Rustdorf, her real life begins, and
| the herself grrdually understands
! those early episodes.
| Although it is in no sense a war
novel, Dorothy Canfield, in taking
; her characters to France in 1914,
i gives a more vivid, a more actual
! sonse of war than is gained in books
I devoted purely to that subject.
Those who have read '"The Bent
Twig" and "Home Fires in France"
I will find the best of those books
| united in the story of the life of
