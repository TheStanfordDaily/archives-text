ABOUT A PUBLIC SUMMONS
The Editor, Sir:
It is- not my desire to offer alibi.
I am guilty as convicted of a con
scious misuse of my Washington
rooter's tickct.
I have a friend, who has a friend.
I gave my ticket gratis.
For this I receive a PUBLIC sum
mons to appear before the Men's
Council. May I ask if this is strictly
according to regular procedure?
Without authority, I question
whether an accusation in the cam
pus Daily constitutes a legitimate
summons.
Monday's paper reported over a
hundred suspected violations of
ticket contracts. Tuesday's paper
asks but ten to appear before the
two councils. Wednesday's paper
tells of the conviction of three.
It sounds like sour-grapes to com
plain. But does this indicate a re
luctance to prosecute more influen
tial offenders; or undue exuberance
to alleviate what must now seem an
over-estimated evil?
We are, I think, too eager to shift
the responsibility of untoward be

! havior in the rooting section. Much,
if not most, of the boisterous dis
approval and drinking there is done
through Stanford lips. After all, the
looting section is hardly a salon.
(Be sure no pun is intended.)
This is sour-grapes, but I wish to
compliment a certain member of the
rally committee on his judicial emi
nence. 1 trusted he acted with more
authority than discretion in pub
licly delivering sentence upon the
miscreants before the specific of
fense had even been properly con
sidered by the council.
Last, I must complain of the
i council's lenience. I am convinced
of the enormity of my act. I realize
that my conviction was to be a
| v/arning to others. Most inappro
priately, I insist that the punish
ment didn't fit the crime.
