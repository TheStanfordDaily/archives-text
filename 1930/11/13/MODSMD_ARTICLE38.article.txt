A witty suggestion appears in the
U.C.L.A. paper that after Stanford's
defeat by U.S.C. and after U.C.L.A.'s
"moral victory" over the Cards,
George Bernard Shaw might Vie
hired to replace "Pop" Warner.
Every defeat is a "moral victory"
for U.C.L.A., according to the
Bruins. They talk about moral vic
tories so much that one might think
actually to win a game was posi
tively immoral.
Cardinals who complain of the
"500" should take cognizance of the
i survey just finished at the Univer
sity of Arizona, which revealed that
about 50 per cent of the women go
barelegged.
Stanford women may possess Wal
ter Winchillian sophistication, but
deserve a vote of congratulation for
their sense of beauty in wearing
stockings.

Temple University now offers
"memory courses."
If the freshman year were devoted
entirely to memory drills, perhaps a
student, would be able to get a high-'
er scholastic average.
Too many courses consist of
memorizing isolated facts that are
soon forgotten and often never
even memorized in the first place.
Especially is this true in elementary
scientific and pseudo-scientific
courses.
Women students at the University
of Idaho have taken up fencing.
Shades of O'Artagnan. Now one
might guess women on dates will
carry dueling swords instead of
roller skates or $5 bills.
