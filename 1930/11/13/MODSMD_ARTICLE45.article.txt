# Soccermen Drop Rough 2-1 Game To San Mateo
## J.C. OUTFIT GRABS TILT FROM CARDS IN FINAL QUARTER Hard Field Slows Redshirt Offense; Christensen, Burns Injured 
### Lowell Cox 
After scoring a goal in the first
10 minutes of play and hanging onto
their scant lead for three quarters
of the game, the Stanford soccer
team yesterday afternoon lost then
second contest to San Mateo Junior
College, 2 to 1.
The hard dirt field of San Mateo
high school, scene of the clash, was
a great' handicap to the Cardinals,
and robbed them of two of their
men.
Burns, Stanford fullback, broke
his arm when he took a had spill in
the middle of the first period. Chris
tensen was also hurt in the second
half, and the loss of these two first
string players was a big factor in
the San Mateo victory.
Card Attack Loose
The Cards confined play in the
first half largely to San Mateo ter
ritory, ..but loose attack prevented
more scoring. Miller counted the
lone Stanford score soon after the
Start of the game.
Many fouls were called on the
Redshirts in the first half, one rob
bing them of a goal near the end
of the period.
San Mateo started the second half
with a determined offensive, and
kept up a pace that placed the
Cards on the defensive for most of
the period. They threatened to score
almost at once, but a desperate Card
defense staved off several attacks.
One San Maleo kick just bounded
over the cross bar. Had it been a
few inches lower it would have
been a certain goal.
Stanford Rally Fails
Shortly after, another drive ended
with the ball in the net, tying the
score. Stanford rallied to pierce the
Junior College defense once in the
period, but the goal kick went wide.
San Mateo soon counted another
tally, and the game was on ice. In
the five minutes remaining, the
Cards made several desperate at
tempts to score, none of which
were successful.
The Redshirts outshone the jun
ior collegians throughout the first
period, in spite of loose play, but
in the second half San Mateo had
things all its own way.
Play was fast and furious, the
Cards fighting as hard as their
brothers on the gridiron ever have,
but the loss of Burns and Christen
sen, and the dirt field were handi
caps too great to overcome.
Second J.C. Victory
The first San Mateo game, played
on the Stanford field, was lost by
a similar score. The Cards had had
but a little practice at the time, and
expected to make up for the loss
yesterday.
Burns will undoubtedly be out
for the rest of the season,* which
will be a big loss to the Cards in the
remaining two games of the Cali
fornia series.
Assistant Coach Ward Smith will
start work this afternoon in pre
paration for the second Bear con
test, which will be played here on
Saturday. The final game will be
played at Berkeley on the morning
of the Big Game.
Stanford won the first California
fray, 3 to 1, two weeks ago.
