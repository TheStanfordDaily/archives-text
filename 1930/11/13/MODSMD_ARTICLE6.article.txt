# Co-eds More Idealistic Happy Home Life Ultimate Goal Dyment Sees Change

C°ILE< »E women of the present generation are more idealistic and
possess higher and liner standards than the common run of grown-ups
give them credit for," said I)r. Bertha S. Dyment, medical adviser to
women, speaking before freshman women students at Kohlc Hall last night.
"The college women of today are the product of an age in which pre
war conservative barriers were broken down. Life, after the war, was an
anti-climax. Dull, bored people, in their searchfor further excitement and
new thrills, turned to the artificial stimulation of the so-called 'jazz age.'
''But the pendulum is now swinging to the tlier extreme. Women arc
growing tired of the feeling that quiet times, intellectual, musical and

philosophical pursuits, have been
relegated to a place of secondary
importance. College women are now
beginning to <%alize moi'e and more
that these are the things upon which
life is based.
"In spite of their apparent desire
to appear blase, their ultimate goal
is that of all womankind—a happy
home life Although their
actions are often based upon an un
reasoning belief that sophistication
is necessary to popularity, to dates,
and to good times, they are, at heart,
as old-fashioned as were the women
of my generation.
"Whereas early marriages were
common in former years due to
three- and four-year college courses
for men, today more people marry
in the thirties than in the twenties.
Long professional training makes it
impossible in many cases for men to
support wives earlier," declared Dr.
Dyment. "This pitting of nature
against economic necessity is one of
the most difficult problems with
which you are faced today.
''Although this and other modern
problems are the hardest which
have ever confronted woman, you
of today, with your college back
ground, will be better qualified to
ccpe with whatever shall arise in
the future."
