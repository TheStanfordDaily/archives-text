# FINANCE CAMPAIGN FOR REST HOMES NOW UNDER WAY
## Local Mothers' Club Plans New Model Building For Student Use 
### 
An endowed and fully equipped
rest home in its own building with
a capacity to accommodate all Stan
ford men and women temporarily
needing home care, sympathy, and
health supervision, is the goal of the
Stanford Mothers' Club, which today
launched a campaign for funds.
The club, an organization of 600
mothers of present and former stu
dents, now operates rest homes for
men and women on the campus.
Twice already this year it has been
necessary to turn students away be
cause only six patients can be ac
commodated in each home.
Students Welcome
Convalescent or run-down stu
dents are welcome after examination
by the University Health Service,
to whom the cases are reported
daily. A charge of $3 a day is made.
In many instances the Students'
Hospital Fund is available for the
first week of an illness, so the pa
tient need only pay $1 a day.
Last year the homes took care of
117 students, almost double the
number in 1928-29 when they were
established.
Mrs. E. J. Thomas is chairman of
the rest home committee, Mrs. Paul
Shoup, vice-chairman, and Mrs. A.
B. Clark, treasurer. Mrs. J. Walter
Bingham and Mrs. J. P. Mitchell
are members of the board of direc
tors.
