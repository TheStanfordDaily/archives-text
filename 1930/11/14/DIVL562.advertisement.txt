WAXANYIPPIE!
(Pronounccd Waxanj ippic)
Shouted Boom Drumm as he fell ex
hausted to the ground after making the
famous Block S hole on the Cardinal Coif
Course in one. What Boom did —you too j
can do—if you try long enough . . . On the
Highway between University Ave. and the
Stadium is the largest, trickiest course be
tween San Mateo and San Jose —27 holes
—including a driving hazard and a pitch
shot, covering an acre of beautifully land
scaped grounds. While you re waiting for
the Cotillion to get going tonight, drop
down and see the Axe Hole, and others.
Only 25c for 27 holes.
