# NO ROOTERS MISHANDLED SAYS M'RAE
## Charges Of Bad Treatment Of Students Declared Hardly Justified 
### 
When questioned as to the alleged
rough treatment of rooters by mem
bers of the Rally Committee during
the Washington game last Saturday,
Kenneth Mcßae, chairman of the
Rally Committee, said that he per
sonally had seen no such action.
"When after the game, two stu
dents came to me and said that they
had been pushed with so much force
that they had been knocked down
the stairs, it was the first time any
thing of the sort came to my notice,"
he remarked.
To Discuss Affair
Mcßae also said that he would dis
cuss the affair at the next meeting
of the Rally Committee, in order to
assure its non-recurrence.
"I can easily see how people could
have been unintentionally pushed
going into the rooting section," he
explained. "The Trustees had com
plained that the aisle to their seats
was always blocked with student
rooters, so the B.A.C. had arranged
an artificial aisle to the rooting sec
tion which was very narrow."
Aisle Crowded
This aisle was jammed with stu
dents, who were moving very slowly
indeed, stopping as they went down
to say hello to their friends, accord
ing to Mcßae. The Rally Committee
had to hurry them up to get them
all seated in time, and in trying to
make the crowd move along faster,
very easily could have shoved some
one by mistake, he said. Since the
stairs were so crowded it was very
easy to trip.
