# WARNER SPEAKS AT '34 SMOKER
## T6alks Stress Importance Of Bonfire Work 
### 
Coach '"Pop" Warner was the
principal speaker last night at the
freshman class smoker held in En
cnia to interest the men of '34 in
the bonfire.
"If every man on the team keeps
strict training and gives everything
he has, there is no reason why Stan
ford cannot turn out a team which
is as good as any other," said War
ner. "I want to congratulate the
freshman class on the showing of
their team this year. With no out
standing high-school stars to start
the season," he concluded, "the team
has done remarkably well."
Introduce Speakers
The smoker was in charge of Bill
Hathaway, chairman of the smoker
committee. He introduced John Al
den, Encina Club president, and
Don Tatum, newly elected class
president. Each gave a short talk
in which they stressed the fact the
bonfire was a class enterprise, and
that every member of the class
should turn out to help.
"This year," declared Tom Pike,
student body president, "U.C. will
be esyecially anxious to light the
pyre. We beat them last year, we
are going to beat them this year,
and most important, we have re
covered the axe.
"Their only chance to retaliate
will be to ignite Stanford's bonfire."
He concluded by urging the fresh
men to guard the fire well.
