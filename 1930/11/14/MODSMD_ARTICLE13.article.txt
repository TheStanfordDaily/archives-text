# TANGLE ENDS ATTEMPT OF PEACE GROUP
## Delegates Demand Direct Vote In Conflict Of Parley 
### 
GENEVA, Nov. 13. (/P). â€”Caught in
a tangle of parliamentary procedure,
the League of Nation's disarmament
commission adjourned today's ses
sion without reaching an agreement
on how to limit land war material.
The confusion came from a pro
fusion of proposals by various dele
gations and at one time became so
marked that Lord Cecil, the British
delegate, threw his hands in the air
and exclaimed to Chairman Loudon:
"Let us have something clear and
definite to vote on."
Direct Vote Demanded
Count von Bcrnstorff, the German
delegate, said he expected to force a
direct vote tomorrow on whether the
majority of the commission wants di
rect or budgetary limitation.
He said Spain, like the United
States, prefers direct limitation, but
like the United States is willing to
let the various countries take their
choice.
Nicholas Politis, Greece's delegate,
said his country preferred the budg
etary plan, but was willing to follow
the majority in adopting an optional
draft.
Russia again came out for simulta
neous application of both direct and
budgetary limitation.
