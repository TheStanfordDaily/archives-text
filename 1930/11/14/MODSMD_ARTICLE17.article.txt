# Change Adopted For Pyre Construction; Committees Named
## Radical Departure Made In 1930 Model Bonfire; To Hire Help 
### 
A radical departure in the con
struction of Big Game bonfires will
be made this year when a tower 60
feet in height and 20 feet square at
the base will be built, it was re
vealed by the Bonfire Committee
yesterday.
The decision to change the type
of pyre from the large and box
shaped bonfire came when it was
found feasible to buy material from
local merchants and to hire unem
ployed Palo Alto carpenters to su
pervise the construction, Dick Oddie,
Bonfire Committee member, de
clared.
Address System
The plans call for the preliminary
work to start Monday when fences,
platforms, and equipment for a pub
lic address system are to be in
stalled.
Actual construction of the pyre
will begin Tuesday and will con
tinue through the night to some
time Wednesday afternoon. The
structure will be burned at the out
door rally to be held Wednesday
night.
Vigil Effective
The one day and night building
of the fire will do away with the
many days of labor required In the
construction heretofore, Oddie said.
The one night vigil of the freshman
workers will greatly increase the
effectiveness of the guarding, lie
declared.
The public address system is to
be furnished by the Associated Oil
Company of San Francisco.
The bonfire will be staged at the
usual site just east of the former
library and north of the Board of
Athletic Control building.
Rally In Open
The rally will be held in the open
for the first time in years. The pro
gram for the event will be staged
on a platform to be erected near
Ihc bonfire and a battery of high
powered searchlights will illuminate
the scene. The public address system
will carry the speeches and skits to
all parts of the campus adjacent to
the pyre.
