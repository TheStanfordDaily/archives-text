# POWER LINE TO BE BUILT ON BASIS OF RYAN EXPERIMENTS
## 
### 
On the basis of tests made on the
Ryan Laboratory's experimental
power line, which was erected last
tail quarter on 12 113-foot steel poles,
the Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany will expend $600,000 on its new
100 mile power line from Tiger River
to Newark. A conductor consisting
<>1 100 miles of copper and 00 miles
of aluminum was finally decided
upon.
Although an alternating current of
only .'lOO,OOO volts was used on these
experiments, the transformers of the
laboratory are capable of producing
as high as 1,000,000 volts. The short
power line was built for the purpose
of making tests on various types of
conductors and insulators.
The steel poles were the contribu
tion of the Pacific Coast Steel Com
pany and were erected with the
money donated by Pacific Coast
power companies.
