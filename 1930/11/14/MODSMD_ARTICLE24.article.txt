i ("Scarface") Capone, Chicago gang
• i land chief, had issued orders not to
j allow grape concentrates, made by
i the Fruit Industries, Ltd., of Cali-
J fornia, to be sold in Chicago, and
the edict has gone out that death

• part of the set-up suggested by the
Federal Farm Board to remove the

i ing thousands of tons of grapes into
by-products and thus keep them
i out of the fresh and dried markets."
