California Institute of Technology,
represented by its football team, has
received the doubtful honor of hav
ing Coach Pop Warner, also known
as the Old Fox of the Stanford Farm,
devise an entirely new lineup of his
Cardinal boys to play the institute
men tomorrow afternoon in the lo
cal bowl.
The eleven men listed above on
the Stanford side of the roster ..'or 111
a combination which has never be
fore taken the Held for a game to
gether and in all probability never
will again.
Packs Experienced
None of the starters can claim un
disputed rating as first string men,
but all of them have had a good deal
of experience in games this season
and know what the game is all about.
Burke, Winnek, and Albertson have
all had two seasons of varsity foot
ball here before this year.
The announced backfield contains
two halfbacks who have been show
ing lots of promise in recent con
tests, and Warner is probably run
ning them in tomorrow in order to
add to their experience and give
them, a chance to hit top stride for
the Big Game.
Lambert Fighter
Rintala has played in all the major
tilts so far this year and has dona
some sweet passing besides proving
his ability as an open field runner.
His running-mate, Lambert, is one
of those aggressive, peppy fellows
who never stop trying hard and suc
ceed in going places by virtue of
those tactics. He looked mighty good
in the tussle with Jimmy Phelan's
Huskies last Saturday.
The other two ball carriers are
both quarterbacks, but the flexibility
of the Warner system makes it easy
for Allen to step into the fullback's
job. Winnek will have his first chance
of the year to open a game tomor
row, having been kept back by such
stars as Hillman and Simkins. Phil
is a hard worker with a lot of abil
ity, and he may surprise a lot of
people when he gets going against
the Engineers.
Marks Good
Seven good football players will
make up the forward wall, even
though they aren't the first string
ensemble. The two guards have each
been-rated regulars at one time or
another during the season, and aren't
out of the fight yet. by any means.
Marks filled in nicely for Taylor
against U.C.L.A. and Washington,
while nobody has noticed any great
weakening of the team when Albert -
son and Colvin have been substitu
ted for Doub and Neill.
Many fans consider Grey a better
tackle than Bogue, whose substitute
he is, a belief to which Warner gave
weight after the U.S.C. debacle by
shifting him to the first team. Burke's
only weakness is that he isn't always
able to last a full game. He started
against Santa Clara, however, and
has gone in at various stages of sev
eral other tilts.

add to their experience and give
them, a chance to hit top stride for
the Big Game.
Lambert Fighter
Rintala has played in all the major
tilts so far this year and has dona
some sweet passing besides proving
his ability as an open field runner.
His running-mate, Lambert, is one
of those aggressive, peppy fellows
who never stop trying hard and suc
ceed in going places by virtue of
those tactics. He looked mighty good
in the tussle with Jimmy Phelan's
Huskies last Saturday.
The other two ball carriers are
both quarterbacks, but the flexibility
of the Warner system makes it easy
for Allen to step into the fullback's
job. Winnek will have his first chance
of the year to open a game tomor
row, having been kept back by such
stars as Hillman and Simkins. Phil
is a hard worker with a lot of abil
ity, and he may surprise a lot of
people when he gets going against
the Engineers.
Marks Good
Seven good football players will
make up the forward wall, even
though they aren't the first string
ensemble. The two guards have each
been-rated regulars at one time or
another during the season, and aren't
out of the fight yet. by any means.
Marks filled in nicely for Taylor
against U.C.L.A. and Washington,
while nobody has noticed any great
weakening of the team when Albert -
son and Colvin have been substitu
ted for Doub and Neill.
Many fans consider Grey a better
tackle than Bogue, whose substitute
he is, a belief to which Warner gave
weight after the U.S.C. debacle by
shifting him to the first team. Burke's
only weakness is that he isn't always
able to last a full game. He started
against Santa Clara, however, and
has gone in at various stages of sev
eral other tilts.

Cardinal boys to play the institute

Packs Experienced
None of the starters can claim un

Burke, Winnek, and Albertson have

The announced backfield contains
two halfbacks who have been show
