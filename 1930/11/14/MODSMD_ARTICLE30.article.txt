Stan lord women are more idealistic and possess higher and finer
standards than the common run of grown-ups give them credit for.
I his is the opinion of Dr. Pert ha Dyment, medical adviser to
women, who believes that college women are once more returning
io the realization that a happ\ home life is the ultimate goal of all
womankind.
This observation coming from an authority so close to the voting
women of today is extremely interesting. It shows that everything
is not wrong with the present generation.
The present period is supposed to have been affected by what
Dr. Dyment terms the artificial stimulation of the iav.v. age. I low
ever. Dr. Dyment believes college women are growing tired of the
feeling that "quiet times, intellectual, musical and philosophical pur
suits. have been relegated to a place ol secondary importance."
I ndoubtedly this comes as welcome news to the alarmists who
have been viewing what they term a serious problem; and on the
other hand, it comes as a bit ol proof to the optimists that all would
end well. ,
