SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA. At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.
Last Sunday's program was in the
main a program of sheer strength
and power. Wagner's "Meister
singer" overture opened the con
cert, followed by the Ballet Music
from the "Perfect Fool" by Gustav
Hoist, a modern English composer.
Sophie Eraslau sang two songs, and
the orchestra closed the program
with Tschaikowsky's Fifth Sym-
I phony. Basil Cameron, the conduc
tor, brought out the power latent
in these numbers very decidedly,
and his interpretation of the Fifth
Symphony was worthy of the ova
tion which it received.
i This Sunday the orchestra will
piay a popular program including
Beethoven's Leonore Overture, a
.suite by Handel, and a movement
from Tschaikowsky's Third Suite.

SUCCESS. By Lion Fcuchlwangcr.
Viking Press, I?>.*{<). (A( (lie Palo
Alio Rook Shop.)
Painting with the 780 pages of
"Success" a vast picture of Munich
life, Lion Feuchtwanger in this vol
ume contrasts Bavarian justice with
Bavarian injustice, and its pity with
its cruelty, in following the life and
death of his chief character, Martin
Krueger.
Krueger, a director of Munich's
National Galleries, is imprisoned,
and as the fight between those who
wish his freedom and those who de
-1 sire him kept in prison grows in
intensity, so does Feuchtwanger's
contrast between evil and good.
The volume, which tells of the
period of time between 1921 and
1923, is very nearly a masterpiece.

It even surpasses the author's "The
j Ugly Duchess" and his '"Power." Its
one fault, if it may so be called, is
that its characters lose the sharp
ness of their own identity in the
great flowing stream of persons
' which fills the novel's pages.

MEMOIRS OF AN INFANTRY OF
FICER. By Siegfried Sassoon.
Coward, McCann, Inc., New
York, 1930. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
This is an entirely new outlook
on the late War, the story of what
that war meant to a certain class
i of Englishmen, and the effect it had
on its social background.
War books are beginning to be a
drug on the market. Remarque has
| given the world the best from the
point of view of the private, and
Sassoon has completed the story
with this, Ills second novel.
His work has none of the sordid
| ness or insistence on horror which
j characterizes the great mass of
other war books. There is no preju
; dice, pettiness, or injured feelings
1 in his attitude. The war seemed as
i senseless and unnecessary to him
' as to others who have written about
jit and reviled it, but he indicates
I rather than forces his disgust and
i indignation in a way that is far
i more effective than any amount of
descriptive gruesomeness.
Sassoon and Rupert Brooke were
: the two finest young war poets, and
| Sassoon was the only one of the
pair to survive. The prose of his
! novels has borrowed much of that
j poetic quality. This book then has
Ihe distinction of being one of the
| few war novels written in a beauti
ful style by a practiced writer.
