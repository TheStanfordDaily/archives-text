## 
### 
B. J. Crehan and B. Hope Elletson ,
are the two men who will represent '
National' Union of Students of Eng
land in a debate with Stanford Mon
day night at 8:15 in the Assembly i
Hall, on the question: "Resolved, that
the principle of democracy has been
tried and found wanting."
Crehan, who represents the Uni- i
versity of Liverpool, is 23 years old.
He left school at fourteen and for
seven yeai's worked for various ;
commercial concerns. During this i
time he attended evening courses i
in economics and studied industrial j
administration at Manchester Col- ,
lege of Technology for two years.
Has Varied Career
At twenty Crehan became local ]
secretary of the Worker's Educa
tional Association. Through this
work he was awarded a scholarship
to the University of Liverpool where ;
he obtained a diploma in social sci
ence, and is now reading for a B.A.
degree in social science and eco- â– 
nomics. He has had a great deal of
debating experience and has been
active in political work for the So
cialist Party.
Elletson is from St. John's College,
Oxford. He attended preparatory
school at Scarborough, and then at ,

Wellington, where he was president
of the debating society. After a year
in business he obtained a scholar
ship to Oxford, where he has been
reading law. He has been very
prominent in Oxford debating cir
cles.
Elletson Ranks High
Robert M. McClintock, who met
Crehan at debates in England last
April, says of him, "This Liverpool
firebrand (he is rabidly Socialist)
takes rank with the best of English
university debaters. His reputation
as a speaker of shrewd ability, as a
skillful satirist, and as the possessor
of a refreshing humor is well found
ed in fact.
"Elletson," states McClintock, "is
known to me by reputation rather
than by actual encounter in debate.
It is enough to say that he comes as
the representative of the Oxford
Union, which, with the Cambridge
Union, is the guardian of a tradi
tion that embodies the finest ele
ments of British debating."
The Stanford team which is to
meet these men is composed of Irv
ing Rosenblatt, Jr., and George E.
Shibley. Both men have had wide
experience in debates.
Admission will be by student
body card or 50 cents.
