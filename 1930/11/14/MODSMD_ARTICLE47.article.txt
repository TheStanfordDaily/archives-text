# Gray Gridmen Set For U.C. Tussle Tomorrow
## CUDDEBACK'S MEN AT PEAK FOR TILT WITH BEAR GOOFS Redshirt Backfield Strong; Chances Hurt By Loss Of Bates, Corbus 
### 
j After putting his squad through
I a light practice session yesterday
i afternoon, Coach Murray Cuddeback
! announced himself contented that
! the 1930 Stanford Grays would be at
the peak of condition for their en-
I counter with California's Goofs at
Berkeley Saturday.
j "We've got a good backfield this
| year. Better, if anything, than we
I had last year," declared Cuddeback
yesterday.
Line Not Strong
"However, the line is not up to
standard. The men are iill in fine
1 physical condition at present, but
the loss of Bates and Corbus, two
I very good men, at the beginning of
the season through injuries, was a
severe blow to the team.''
Because the Gray's schedule this
year consists of only the one game
j with California, it is difficult to
' make any prediction on tomorrow's
game. It is not likely that it will be
a repetition of last year's clash, when
j Ihc Grays scattered their Blue and
j Gold opponents in a 39 to 2 stam
| pede.
Lineup Named
; Cuddeback announced a tentative
| starting lineup last night. It includes
Rogers and Tway, ends; Prelsnik
and Gribbin, tackles; White and
Toss or Toepke, guards; and Card,
center. Warren and Afflerbaugh,
i halves; Hancock, full; and Boushey,
at quarter, complete the backfield.
I This lineup may be subject to
1 change before the game, however.
The contest is scheduled to pre
cede the California-Nevada en
counter and will start at 12 o'clock
Saturday in California Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley.
