By Shannon Allen
Golf widows, anxious co-eds, and
friends can now sit and chat in
comfort while their rabid com
panions dig up the turf and be.at the
small white pellet around the. Stan
ford golf course, as the long-herald
ed $46,000 clubhouse is to be in
formally opened tomorrow morning.
As one goes up the winding road
from the "Farm" the large white
stucco, red-tile-roofed building
; stands out with striking effect at
the top of the rise, surrounded by
the olive green of the oak trees and
the lighter, more emerald shade of
ihe fairways.
Wide Veranda
For the warm days there is a wide
veranda stretching across the front
of the building on which many a
tale of "How I made a birdie on the
third" will be told.
Listeners' eyes and minds will

more probably be wandering over
Lagunita and the red Spanish tiled
roofs of the Quad in the foreground
' and the bay and distant foothills
which form the marvelous tree
framed panorama seen from the
porch.
, For winter days to come the spa
cious lounge with its huge fireplace
with a log fire blazing on the hearth
| and its deep-oushioned wicker fur
niture prove a popular gather
ing place.
Lunch Counter
A large fountain and light lunch
counter fitted out with the most
modern equipment fills one side of
the room, for the refreshment of the
weary golfers as they return from
+he links.
The women's locker room, well
equipped with showers, dressing
i space, and 60 lockers, is situated in
| back of the lounge.
