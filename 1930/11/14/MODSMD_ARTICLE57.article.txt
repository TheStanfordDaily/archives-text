# PHYSICISTS FINISH EXPERIMENTS WITH ELECTRIC CURRENT
## 180,000 Volts Production Of Direct Current Can Now Be Controlled

Giving a keener insight into the j
workings of the "inscrutable" atom J
—nearly two years after a small !
band of Stanford physicists started
experimenting—accurate control of !
dirept electrical current has been
doubled from 85,000 volts to more >
than 180,000 volts, Professor D. L. '
Webster revealed yesterday.
Dr. Webster, head of the physics j
department here, with three col- j
kagues from his staff, Dr. P. A.
Ross, professor of physics, Harry
Clark, a research assistant, and W. ,
W. Hansen, a physics instructor, j
„ finally managed to subjugate for use '
in the x-ray laboratory a direct |
current of electrons going at a speed
two-thirds as great as that of light. ;
Dr. Webster revealed his belief j
that for the first time in the world ;
such fast electrons were being con- I
trolled and use with less than one- '
tenth of one per cent error. This '
was contrasted with former uses of
as high a voltage but resulting oft- j
times in 50 times as much error. |
The remarkable fact of the work
of the Stanford physicists, Dr. Web
ster said, was not the production of l
180,000 volts of direct current where
only 85,000 volts had been used be
fore, but its very steady and ac- '
curately controllable working for
Ihe purpose of testing modern ideas j
about processes going on in the in
terior parts of atoms where rela- j
tively large amounts of energies are j
required for the moving of the elec- ,
trons.
The accurate control of a greater
voltage than heretofore is expected
to reveal tjie inside atoms that re
quire a huge voltage to budge.
