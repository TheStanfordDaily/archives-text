# INTEREST CENTERS IN HALF-MILE RUN, POLE VAULT TODAY
## 
### 
Interest in today's regular weekly
track meet will center in two events,
the half-mile race and the pole
vault, according to Assistant Track
Coach Bill Ellington.
Deacon, Menlo Junior College
transfer, and DeGroot, junior pole
vaulter, are expected to battle for
first honors in the vault, as each
man has been clearing the bar at 12
feet 6 inches during the past week.
In the 660-yard run, Jimmy Wil
son, frosh runner, Garbeson, junior
distance man, and Frank Fullen- ;
wider, sophomore, will probably '
finish in close order with Fullen
wider in the lead, Ellington asserted.
Absence of real competition for
Hec Dyer, sprint star, will rob the
short runs of much of their interest,
the coach said. Les Hables, who will
not run because of a strained leg
muscle, is expected to be back in !
competition before long.
