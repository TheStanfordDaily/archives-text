# DR. JORDAN SHOWS SLOW IMPROVEMENT
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan,, first
president of Stanford and now chan
cellor emeritus of the University, is
just a little more than holding his
own in health at present. He is hav
ing two "walking lessons" a week
with the assistance of two men, but
the possible results are not known.
There is no hope that he will ever
be able to walk without assistance,
but last year it was not expected
that he would be able to walk at all.
His chronic bad health makes it im
possible for Dr. Jordan to read or
attend to any of his correspondence.
