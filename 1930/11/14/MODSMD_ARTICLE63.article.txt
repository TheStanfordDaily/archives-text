CALSHOT, Eng., Nov. 13. </P) â€” j
The Gei'man seaplane, DO-X, which j
has known the guiding touch of i
royal British hands, will take off for j
Bordeaux at 9 o'clock tomorrow
morning on the third leg of its
projected flight to New York. After
that it is only Lisbon, then the At
lantic.
The Prince of Wales, who went
aloft, in the huge twelve-motored
ship yesterday and assumed the
| controls for ten minutes, was the
, last visitor to board her. Today the
I plane lay at anchor while refueling
! was completed.
Twelve passengers will make to
i morrow's flight, including Frau
i Dornier, wife of the inventor and
builder, and Lady Drummond-Hay,
who has crossed the Atlantic three
times in the Graf Zeppelin.
The weather prospects were good
and it appeared tonight that nolh
j ing would interfere with the sched- j
uled take-off. Captain Friederich
i Christiansen, the commander, ex
pressed confidence in the success of
the Atlantic flight.
