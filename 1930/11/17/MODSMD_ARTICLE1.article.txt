Rumors Published
According to Associated Press dis
patches one paper yesterday said,
"The answer to the present contro
versy raging in the 'Big Three' of
California football may be an order
from the presidents of the University
of California and Stanford Univer
sity to strike the University of
Southern California from the grid
iron schedules of the two northern
institutions."
From unnamed sources, but which
the paper says it considers authori
tative, it summarizes the situation to
give the following reasons for the
joint grievances believed to be
nursed by California and Stanford
against U.S.C.:
Grievances Listed
1. Subsidizing of athletes.
2. Academic laxity permits longer
and better practice hours for the
Trojans.
3. Use of a loophole in the "tri
angular agreement" to get poor
scholars on the U.S.C. varsity.
The paper says in effect it has
reason to believe matters will come
to a head at the Pacific Coast Con
ferencd meeting in Los Angeles De
cember 8. Next seasons football
schedule will be drawn up then.
The faculty athletic representatives
make the final approval of the
schedule and, the article states, the
dope is the faculty representatives
of Stanford and California, on the
orders of their presidents, may strike
U.S.C. from the list, without any ii's,
buts, or explanation's."
