Indian war drum, today arrived at the Keyhole Depot in Pekin.
Muddy and bedraggled, Boom told a talc of hardships unequalled in
the annals of drum-rolling. Five hundred miles from the edge of the
desert be ran into a raging snowstorm, and negotiated the last stages of
his trip borne on the crest of a swirling torrent.
Drum was taken to the hospital suffering from mal-de-mcr, and
will be unable to complete the (rip to Palo Alto, a Pacific Coast metropo
lis, and destination of the drum.
Drum gave instructions to Have the "symbol «»f Stanford victory"
outfitted with wings and a small motor. He plans lo have the drum flown
across the Pacific.
A pilot for the flight has not been chosen, but Norm Nifflesprocket,
former Bear hunter, and Ffinchley Fflafflewogg, one-time municipal
crossings sweeper, are leading candidates for the job. Though neither
man has had any experience in flying, Drum claims it will be no
handicap, as he says it will be new stuff for the drum, too.

should be in mid-ocean and a quandary by morning.
