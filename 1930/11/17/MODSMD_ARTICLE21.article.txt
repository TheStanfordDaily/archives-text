# GROUP ADVOCATES CAREFUL THINKING OF LIFE VOCATION
## 
### 
Take time to puzzle over your
i choice of a vocation but don't wait
, until your senior year to decide.
Early thinking on the subject is of
greater importance than an early
conclusion.
That is the advice of the voca
tional guidance committees, accord
ing to C. Gilbert Wrenn, secretary j
of the University committee, which j
co-operates with the student guid- '
ance body, headed by Jack Snyder, j
"Realizing that many fields are |
overcrowded and that it is unwise to j
wait too long to decide the often |
perplexing question of occupation, i
the students asking for conferences J
this year are younger than the group
last year," Wrenn said. "On the
other hand, more alumni are com
ing back for vocational re-adjust
ments, showing the need for this
! work."
This year the program of the com- j
mittees is being carried out along j
1 three general lines: self-analysis |
tests and blanks, contacts with sue- |
cessful men, and conferences with i
members of the committees.
The School of Education, in its!
course "Introduction to the Study of i
Education," required of all education |
majors, is endeavoring to outline the |
' field and test the members of the |
class in the hope that those unfitted |
i for the profession will not waste |
their time preparing for it. Juniors J
majoring in the school arc to be j
checked periodically as their sue- ;
cess and attitude in their courses, j
said Wrenn, who is also acting in-i
structor in education. r
