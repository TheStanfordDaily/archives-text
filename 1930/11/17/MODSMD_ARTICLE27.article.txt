# RESERVE BACKS TAKE WORKOUT
## ##N TECH GAME Cards Swamp Engineers By 57-7; Pointing For U.C. Bears LONG PASSES FEATURE 
### Stewart Crawford 
Having "breathed" through the
annual Cal Tech workout by a 57-7
score Saturday before a mere hand
ful of rabid Farm fans who through
out the alleged contest seemed to
sympathize with the Engineers, Pop
Warner's Redshirts can now buckle
down to preparing for the Big Game.
Saturday's "breather" ran true to
form, with most of the breathing be
ing done by second- and third-string
Card backfield men on long jaunts
to the Cal Tech goal line. Pop's
first-string warriors breathed easily
on the bench, while the spectators
were breathing in the rhythmic
fashion that indicates a semi-sleep
ing condition.
Tcchmcn Score
Only for a brief moment in the
first quarter did the listless affair
l'ouse the onlookers, who cheered
lustily when Eastman took a lateral
from Bennett and galloped through
a hole in tackle to continue un
touched 55 yards for the only Cal
Tech score. A conversion by Dickey
gave the Engineers a short-lived
lead of 7 to 6,
It was then that Warner put in a
few of his more experienced Red
shirts, notably Simkins and Colvin,
who from that moment figured in a
sustained aerial drive featuring
mighty heaves to the far corners of
the gridiron.
Mighty Heaves
Of the eight Stanford scores added
after the Engineers had held the
lead at the end of the first period,
only three were made by running
plays, with Simkins, Clark, and
Laird each accounting for touch
downs on line plays.
Warner, evidently not intending
I to give away any of his power and
deception plays to any U.C. or Dart
mouth scouts who might possibly
have had the optimism to imagine
that he would, had Simkins tossing
the pigskin high and handsome
throughout the remaining three
quarters.
An idea of the length of these
throws may be gained by rccount
; ing the method by which five of the
Cardinal touchdowns were scored.
Soon after entering the game, Sim
kins tossed one to Laird from the
20-yard mark into scoring territory.
Engineers Fight
j Near the start of the last half,
Simkins let go a mighty heave which
traveled a good 40 yards to light in
the arms of Colvin, who was all
alone across the Engineers' goal.
Through the remainder of the game
the Card fullback continued to throw
long tosses for touchdowns, with
! Clark receiving one from the 30-
yard mark, Laird taking one from
the 20-, and Colvin snatching a 30-
yard toss on the Cal Tech 30-yard
line and galloping the remaining
distance to the goal line.
Watson Good
Shuler at tackle for the visitor:,
displayed some of the fight that his
father, "Fighting Bob" Shuler, di
rects at Los Angeles politicians,
causing Pop's reserves a little worry
until he was taken out of the game
exhausted from his vain efforts.
Watson at full showed not a little
I class, being the only man on the
Tech roster heavy enough to cope
! with the superior weight of the Red -
shirts.
A couple of Grey's kick of Fy pro
' vided thrills for the bored spectator-;
by soaring long and straight to land
between the opponents' goal posts,
failing by a few feet of clearing the
| cross bar.

Only for a brief moment in the
first quarter did the listless affair
l'ouse the onlookers, who cheered
lustily when Eastman took a lateral
from Bennett and galloped through
a hole in tackle to continue un
touched 55 yards for the only Cal
Tech score. A conversion by Dickey
gave the Engineers a short-lived
lead of 7 to 6,
It was then that Warner put in a
few of his more experienced Red
shirts, notably Simkins and Colvin,
who from that moment figured in a
sustained aerial drive featuring
mighty heaves to the far corners of
the gridiron.

Of the eight Stanford scores added

only three were made by running
