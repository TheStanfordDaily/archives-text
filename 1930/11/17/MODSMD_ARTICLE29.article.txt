# A 						MATTER OF ELUCIDATION
## 
### 
The Daily this morning acknowledges the receipt of a
campus opinion letter from (iahriel Misceglia, senior student. The
Daily hereby informs Hisceglia that it will print his campus opin
ion, hut it believes his communication is irrelevant and immaterial,
besides being inaccurate as to the purpose of the recent assessments
charged students who were found guilty of transferring their root
er's tickets.
Bisceglia's letter to the Daily emphasized a number
of points alleged to deal with the matter of transferring
rooter's tickets. He was found guilty of violating his
ticket contract by the Men's Council at its meeting Fri
day after investigation by the Board of Athletic Con
trol showed he had given his ticket to another student,
who, according to his own admission, was working at
the game and was not supposed to leave his post. The
person that finally held Bisceglia's ticket was revealed
by the B.A.C. to be a non-student.
I lisceglia maintains:
1. Public summons before the Men's Council is not fair.
1. That the Rally Committee branded as "scalpers" those stu
dents it had apprehended as alleged transfers.
3. That the students deplore the action of the Rally
Committee in attempting to clear the rooting section
of undesirables.
•I. That campus representatives of newspapers secured the
names of.ticket misusers from the Hoard of Athletic Control in
violation of the "system used here at Stanford to keep the acts and
punishments secret."
5. Thai the action of the student authorities to rid the rooting
1 eetion of undesirables will lead to ill feeling on the part of those
students who are to graduate within the next four years.
Bisceglia added a note to the letter—which was a
copy of a communication sent to Virgil Dowell, chair
man of the Men's Council—addressed to the editor in
which he requested that he be allowed to make his criti
cism behind the nom-de-plume of "One of the Ten."
The Daily will attempt to elucidate for the benefit of I lisceglia
and those students who do not understand the recent actions of the
I 'ally Committee, the Hoard of \thletic Control, ihe Daily, and the
Men's Council.
The I )ajly declares:
I. A public summons before any judicial body has been resorted
1o from lime immemorial. It might be pointed out that the Kallv Com
mittee in charge of prosecution requested the Daily to print the
names and that the Men's Council acted at the behest of the Rally
< ommittee.
2. The Rally Committee did not regard those stu
dents who transferred their rooter's tickets as "scalp
ers," but as students who were not willing to co-operate
with the remainder of the student body in keeping the
rooting section clean and decent.
3. That students do not deplore the attempts of the Rally Com
mittee to clear the section of undesirables, but, on the other hand,
are endeavoring to co-operate whole hcartedly, having realized the
necessity and desirability of doing so.
4. The campus correspondents did not secure the names of the
students trom the li.A.C .. but copied the story that appeared in the
Daily, a procedure recognized by everv newspaper.
5. Those students who feel the action to clear the
section is an indication of ill will toward them, are not
the type of students desired to represent Stanford as
students or as alumni.
\'o doubt llisceglia feels he has been grossly mistreated at the
hands of the student authorities and the li.A.C. However, his guilt
on the charge of transferring a rooter's ticket and his admission to
the Men's ( ouncil he was guilty, only illustrates he had no intention
of co-operating to keep the rooting section free from obnoxious
and unwanted undesirables.
