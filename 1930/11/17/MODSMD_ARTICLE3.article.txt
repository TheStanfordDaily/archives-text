# Comics' Convention Severs Connections With College Humor
## Association of College Comics Votes Magazine Not True Representative of University Life; Stanford Relations Are Now Broken 
### 
/COMPLETE severance of relations with College Humor was the most
' important step taken at the annual convention of the Western Associa
tion of College Comics which closed Saturday in Los Angeles, according
to Burnell Gould, editor of the Stanford Chaparral, who was one of the
delegates to the convention.
This action, taken by unanimous vote and scheduled to go into effect
with the next issue of each member magazine, was decided upon because
it was felt that College Humor is not representative of college life, Gould
says. Hitherto the national magazine has had exclusive reprint rights to
all matter appearing in most of the Coast humorous publications, but it

has been found that it misrepresents
its advertising coverage in the col
lege field and that it hinders the
college comics associated with it, he
declares.
History Unfavorable
The action of the convention in
this matter was based partly on the
history of the past unsatisfactory
relations between the association
and College Humor, and is not al
together unprecedented. Chaparral
broke relations with College Humor
in 1928. Washington Columns and
the Harvard Lampoon are other
leading college magazines which
have broken with College Humor.
Gould believes that this severance
of relations is a long stride toward
the complete independence of col
lege comics from exploiters and is
part of a general feeling that col
lege life is being grossly misrepre
sented by emphasis on what might
be called "Hey, hey, hooey" and
semi-pro football.
Co-operation Asked
Representatives of College Humor
were not present at the meeting, but
Editor H. M. Swanson sent a tele
gram requesting whole-hearted co
operation for another year.
The convention recommended that
its action be taken under advise
ment by the Middle Western, East
ern, and Southern associations of
college comics for action at their
meetings to be held later this year.
College Delegates
Comic publications who sent dele
gates to this year's meeting, to
which the U.S.C. Wampus, edited
by Wilma Goodwin, was host, were:
Arizona Kitty-Kat, Washington Col
umns, California Pelican, Nevada

Chaparral. The U.C.L.A. Claw was
admitted to membership. The Utah
Humbug was the only member of
the association which was not repre
sented.
Harold David, business manager
of Chappie, accompanied Gould as
the second Stanford delegate.
