THE VIRTUOUS SIN with Walter
Huston a( the Varsity Theatre.
j Kay Francis, as Mary Sablin in
"The Virtuous Sin" which opened
yesterday at the Varsity, is a sinner
who would adorn any household.
She is also the most able player in
the cast, although Walter Huston
gives an excellent performance as
a ruthless Russian general.
The sin around which the film's
1 plot is centered was at first duty to
Marya, who had resolved to sacri-
I lice her virtue to save her hus
-1 hand's life, but at last she forgets
the duty and sins just for love,
i As Gregori Platolf, the army's
"iron man" whose metal has been
| considerably softened at the con
j elusion of the last reel, Huston is
well cast. His part is played with
' suavity and skill, but it does not
• quite reach the level attained by
Kay Francis.
Kenneth McKenna, who, as the
somewhat weak husband, gives the
impression that his life is hardly
'■ worth sinning for, deserves mention
a.s an actor performing well in a
! minor role. J. McG.
i V
THE BIG TRAIL—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
The photography of "The Big
; Trail" is the only thing that keeps
i one from being entirely disillusioned

with producers in general. It is ex
cellent from beginning to end.
The plot is the usual one in this
sort of picture, somewhat like "The
Covered Wagon" without a crisis
in which one can become really ex
cited. Good snow storms, cloud
bursts, and an Indian War, look
promising at times, but nothing
really happens.
Perhaps if they had called "The
Big Trail" a movietone travelogue
of the time of our ancestors, we
wouldn't have expected to see a
stirring and dramatic epic of the
making of a nation. —J. N.
CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK—
At the California Theatre, May
field.
Amos and Andy emerge from
their etherial realm to the celluloid
kingdom in a clever farce entirely
suited to their talents. The famous
pair manages to be as funny on the
screen as during their nightly radio
stint.
The film is an account of the
ups and downs of the Fresh Air
Taxicab Company, very similar to
the radio episodes, with a love story
woven in featuring Sue Carroll.
Amos says he "ain't gonna do it,"
Andy gets "regusted," and (he whole
thing is entertaining.

THE BIG TRAIL—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
The photography of "The Big
; Trail" is the only thing that keeps
i one from being entirely disillusioned

with producers in general. It is ex
cellent from beginning to end.
The plot is the usual one in this
sort of picture, somewhat like "The
Covered Wagon" without a crisis
in which one can become really ex
cited. Good snow storms, cloud
bursts, and an Indian War, look
promising at times, but nothing
really happens.
Perhaps if they had called "The
Big Trail" a movietone travelogue
of the time of our ancestors, we
wouldn't have expected to see a
stirring and dramatic epic of the
making of a nation. —J. N.
CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK—
At the California Theatre, May
field.
Amos and Andy emerge from
their etherial realm to the celluloid
kingdom in a clever farce entirely
suited to their talents. The famous
pair manages to be as funny on the
screen as during their nightly radio
stint.
The film is an account of the
ups and downs of the Fresh Air
Taxicab Company, very similar to
the radio episodes, with a love story
woven in featuring Sue Carroll.
Amos says he "ain't gonna do it,"
Andy gets "regusted," and (he whole
thing is entertaining.
Check and double check!

THE VIRTUOUS SIN with Walter
Huston a( the Varsity Theatre.
j Kay Francis, as Mary Sablin in
"The Virtuous Sin" which opened
yesterday at the Varsity, is a sinner
who would adorn any household.
She is also the most able player in
the cast, although Walter Huston
gives an excellent performance as
a ruthless Russian general.
The sin around which the film's
1 plot is centered was at first duty to
Marya, who had resolved to sacri-
I lice her virtue to save her hus
-1 hand's life, but at last she forgets
the duty and sins just for love,
i As Gregori Platolf, the army's
"iron man" whose metal has been
| considerably softened at the con
j elusion of the last reel, Huston is
well cast. His part is played with
' suavity and skill, but it does not
• quite reach the level attained by
Kay Francis.
Kenneth McKenna, who, as the
somewhat weak husband, gives the
impression that his life is hardly
'■ worth sinning for, deserves mention
a.s an actor performing well in a
