Bang! And a noise outside the
window—only this time it isn't an
other Redskin biting the dust. It's
just anything that happens to be
loose, falling in the mud, blown
down by the wind that is "so un
usual for California."
Of course, we should have known
that the Indian Summer days we've
been having were too good to last—
but it's a bit hard to change a fire
bird into a water-fowl, over night.
II" ihe rain continues much
longer, we'll announce to you,
sometime this week, the date for
the formal opening of (he Mud-
Scow season on Lake Lagunita
on-the-Farm. (That means it'll
he open season for shooting any
or all loons and mudhens found
within shooting distance, on the
campus. Each hunter, is limited
to five hundred birdies No,
there are no stymies in tins
game.)
Some two-hundred-fifty-odd high
school journalists collected here
Saturday for a convention—and, we
hope, to be impressed by the way
we do things. One awfully impres
sive thing, if they only had time to

' notice it, was the football score we
lan up against whomever it was we
were playing! Too bad we couldn't
have had a nice, slushy field when
the Confederate South invaded.
Study of the police court system
is getting to be almost as popular
as Law itself, among gentlemen stu
dents here. Sunday morning, about
eight o'clock, four bedraggled look
ing roughs dragged themselves
wearily to bed, after some hours
spent attempting to explain to the
San Francisco police their presence
at some place where they didn't be
long later than midnight, Saturday.
Not a Stanford co-ed had a lock-out,
that night.
Toyon Club members are issuing
a request, a warning, an ultimatum,
or anything else you wish to call it:
If the lady performers in the
Football Gaieties insist upon prac
ticing their acts in the Toyon lobby
before five in the afternoon, any
day, they may expect to see, and are
not under any condition to be
shocked, at the wide, wild collec
tion of Toyonite bathrobes on dis
play. We college students must have
I comfort in our own lounging rooms.
