# Campus Opinion
## WELL, SIR, MAYBE IT'S SO: MAYBE NOT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
After a few hours' deliberation
following today's meeting of the
Council, I feel that there are a few
matters that seem to be of sufficient
importance to the writer to warrant
a little more comment.
In the first place it would be safe
to say that the general opinion about
the school is that the men that were
summoned before the Council were
Working under unfair conditions.
They were summoned by an article
printed in the Daily, and their names
appeared on the front page like sore
spots. The attention of the campus
was centered on those ten victims,
and incessant rumors circulated
about their "malicious" acts.
Heretofore, I believe that the pol
icy of the Men's Council was to
summon the people to appear before
them by mail, and the names were
to be kept secret. The results of the
trials were to be kept secret also,
and whatever information that was
to find its way into print was to re
fer only to "A Certain Student."
The ten persons that were the vic
tims of the great researches of the
Rally Committee were immediately
branded as "Scalpers." The work
was so efficiently carried out that
they found ten out of one hundred
! suspects that were violators of the
| rules. Can it be that the Student
i Body of Stanford University is sy
i perfect that only ton in a school of
I thirty-five hundred are to be labeled
! as miscreants? What happened to
the other ninety suspects? Were
1 they so clever, or so able, or so
I smart, or so honest that they were
; permitted to go scott free without
j any further comment? Certainly
! there never was and there never will
! be a school with as little inoffensive
! offenders as were found at the
i Washington Game.
j The action of the Rally Committee
i this last quarter has become so de
! plorable that the members now con
l trol more scorn than respect from
| the students. Such publications
| were not in accordance to the spirit
i prevailing here at Stanford in for
i mer years. The blame for this must
I be shared by the Daily also in print
: ing such articles. At Tuesday's
I meeting of the Council the Editor
! of the Daily was present, and on
; Wednesday morning every single de-
{ tail of the meeting was reported. I
! feel that it is the duty of the Men's
Council to investigate this matter
and act accordingly
There is another point worth men
tioning here, and that is this. Where

did the Campus representatives of
| other newspapers obtain the infor
mation they did, and publish that
ten students were fined for misuse
jof tickets before they were even
tried? The writer investigated one
I of the reports, and found that the in
formation was released by the B.A.C.
■on the morning of the trial. The
I story was then overelaborated by
i the newspaper and it appeared in an
| extremely conspicuous spot in the
i columns of the newspaper referred
to. Again this is another breach of
i the system used here at Stanford
to keep the acts and punishments
| secret.
This letter is written because it is
felt that conditions under which the
i Students must fare arc getting so
; disgusting that many of the future
; alumni leave this school with more
I ill feeling for the school than love.
| It is not a mere sporadic outlet of
j excess energy—it is the result of the
| cumulation of four years' ill feeling
; aroused by some of the leaders in
j the writer's mind. As a consequence
j Stanford can hardly expect to have
a loyal supporter in him under the
existing conditions, and Stanford
, needs her Alumni more than lhey
| need Stanford.
j I trust that you will give a few of
i the points referred to above a little
, thought, and that something will be
| done to bring these tactics to an end.
Yours very truly,
—One of the Ten
