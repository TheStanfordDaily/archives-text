Experiments at Purdue show that
men study better when hypnotized.
In other words, men study better
when the outside influence of wo
men is absent.
Yet it seems true that whereas
women may distract men after they
get to the library, they probably
would never even get there if wo
men were not to be found in the
campus book conservatory.
At Columbia University they are
discussing the professor's debt to
the student. Most professors realize
that the stimulation of the younger
generation prevents' them from fos
silizing into a hybrid organismâ€”half
librarian and half statistician.
A faculty member at Ohio Wes
leyan states that students have
plenty of romance. One hesitates to
contradict a professor but it must
be recognized that not only do stu
dents Tack plenty of romance, but
most enjoy none at all.

The last remnants of romance
perished with the advent of modern
psychology. This so-called science
attempts to analyze not only motor
actions but emotions, ideals, and
sentiments.
When idealism and sentiment are
reduced to a series of mundane fac
tors, romance becomes as colorful
as a dish of mashed potatoes.
A vocational bureau to help co
ids decide what to do after college
has ben organized at Temple Uni
versity.
Colleges train women to become
lawyers, doctors, interior decorators,
and what not; and yet the over
whelming number of graduating
co-eds become wives.
Vocational bureaus convince co
eds that most of them will marry;
it is high time that universities
train co-eds in the "career" of mar
riage.
It is reported that at the Univer
sity of Paris the men students spend
about 25 cents on average co-ed
dates. It is evident that the Louvre
is not the only advantage to study
ing the fine arts in France.
