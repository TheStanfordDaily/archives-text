# Stanford Grays Wrest 6-0 Victory From U.C.
## SCORE IS GAINED BY AFFLERBAUGH IN LONG SIDE RUN Teams Flounder In Muddy Practice Turf; Field In Stadium Saved 
### Francis Hamilton 
Stanford Grays wrested a meagre
6 to 0 victory from the California
Goof team in a battle contested in
a veritable slough of mud at Berke
ley Saturday. "Kenny" Afflerbaugh,
scintillant Stantord quarter, decided
the game in the Grays' favor when
he gathered in a California punt and
ploughed his way (55 yards down a
sideline to the only touchdown of
the game.
Fearing that the preliminary
would raise havoc with the turf in
the California Memorial Stadium
where the Cal-Nevada clash was
scheduled for the same afternoon,
California officials sidetracked the
Gray-Goof game to the southwest
practice field where a handful of
; spectators sloshed up and down the
sidelines to watch an unrecognizable
mass of players flounder about in
the mud.
Short Gains Made
Under such conditions only
straight football was possible. The
Cardinal team made constant short
gains through the line but were un
! able to approach the California
goal. The Bears found it impos
sible to crack the Stanford forward
v/all and remained on the defensive
during most of the game.
Afflerbaugh's score came early in
ihe second quarter. Stanford had
ended one of their frequent short
drives on the Goofs' 20-yard line.
California punted to Afflerbaugh,
i who received the ball on his own
i 35-yard marked and broke for the
sidelines where a narrow strip of
1 turf extended the length of the field.
Good Interference
Some good interference opened a
lane for Afflerbaugh, and he evaded
a lone Bear tackier on the California
30-yard line and galloped the re
mainder of the way without opposi
tion. Stanford failed to convert.
The only U.C. scoring threat came
near half-time. California recovered
, one of their own partially blocked
punts near mid-field. They were
forced to kick and Afflerbaugh's re
turn kick was blocked and recov
ered by California on Stanford's 12-
yard line. There the Stanford line
held and the Goofs lost the ball on
downs.
Many U.C. Substitutes
In the last half California sub
stituted frequently and the Grays
displayed the best sustained drive
of the game against the fresh men.
Stanford took the ball on their own
30 and with Hancock and Affler
-1 baugh pounding at the line smashed
their way to Cal's 33-yard line.
1 From there a Gray version of the
' varsity forward lateral, Afflerbaugh
to Tway to Perose, put the ball on
the 11-yard line. Here the Bear's
line tightened and the Goofs took
the ball to punt out of danger.
The Stanford line looked the bet
ter of the two, Toepke at guard and
Gribben at tackle showing up well.
Afflerbaugh's punting was a big fac
tor in keeping the sodden pigskin
in Blue and Gold territory and the
ends covered his boots in a work
manlike manner
