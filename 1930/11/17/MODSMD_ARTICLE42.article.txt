# BRILL MAKES PENN ILL
## Marty Got Sore When Penn Said He Was No Good So He Got Revenge With Notre Dame 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Well, Marty had his day, and what
a day it was! Marty, of course, is
Marty Brill, flashy halfback of
Rockne's wonder team of 1930, who
came into his own on Franklin
Field, of Philadelphia, on the after
noon of November 8. You see, Brill
had been a student at Penn three
and four years ago and wanted to
make the football team. Tried out
for it, but got nowhere.
Line Coach Lud Wray, so the
story goes, took a dislike to him and
told Brill's dad, a millionaire street
car manufacturer, that the lad just
"didn't play the kind of football we
play at Penn." That remark rankled
Brill, Sr., and he said something
like '"Well, then, I'll send him to
school where they play a lot better
brand of football!"
So Marty Brill transferred to
Notre Dame, and after a year's in
eligibility made the football team.
Playing at right halfback last year,
lie proved himself a steady, firm
performer, whose strength and de
termination and abilitv to block and

| back up the line won him a place
I among one of the star backfields of
the land. He could carry the ball,
and receive passes too, but the spot
light that plays on touchdown kings
shone on others. *
Came the Big Day, when Notre
Dame played Penn in Philadelphia.
Brill not only scored Notre Dame's
first touchdown on a 66-yard run,
but he scored two others on long
gallops. It was sweet revenge for
Marty and his dad, and complete
vindication for the idea of transfer
ring to Notre Dame. Of course there
are those who will question the
practice of going to a certain school
merely for its football. Also at the
report that Marty's wealthy poppa
gave him $1,000 for each touchdown
1 that he scored. Molla Mallory's
wealthy husband is said to have
presented her with much more than
that when she won her biggest ten
nis victories, and they say that Herb
' Fleishhackeu's daddy used to buy
him a big bond whenever he did
anything in a football way at Sfan
| ford.

Came the Big Day, when Notre
Dame played Penn in Philadelphia.
Brill not only scored Notre Dame's
first touchdown on a 66-yard run,
but he scored two others on long
gallops. It was sweet revenge for
Marty and his dad, and complete
vindication for the idea of transfer

So Marty Brill transferred to
Notre Dame, and after a year's in
