## 
### MICHAEL CROFOOT 
Ten undefeated teams and two
prospective league winners emerged
; from third-round play of the intra
l mural touch football championship
last week.
Handing Delta Upsilon their first
; defeat, 19-0, Theta Chi assumed a
■ commanding position at the head of
j League I. They have to their credit
' victories over the second- and
I third-place teams and have rolled
lup a total of 72 points in three
games while holding their oppon
ents scoreless.
j By disposing of the strong Break
j ers team 26-0 Sigma Chi estab
lished themselves as favorites for
| the championship of League IV. Al
though Sequoia II has also won
| thrice and is in (he van with Sigma
: Chi, the hallmen have yet to play
! Breakers. If they should hurdle this
i obstacle, they meet Sigma Chi in the
; fifth round for premier honors.
Undefeated Teams
1 The other teams unbeaten at the end
of the second round are Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Nu,
i El Toro, Alpha Kappa Lambda, Phi
Delta Theta, and Phi Sigma Kappa.
Pacing League II are the Dells
;«nd the Fijis, but Alpha Delta Phi,
' with the only blot on its record a
1 forfeited game, is right at their
i heels. During the coming week the
i Fijis are matched with the tail-end
! Kappa Alpha aggregation, while the
Delts have to face the up-and-com
; ing Alpha Delts. If the two pace
| setters both win, they will face each
i other, unbeaten, in the fifth and
j final round.
League 111 Standing
; The situation in League 111 is an
| analogy of that in 11. In the van
J with three victories apiece are Sigma

Nu and El Toro. The former team
has a game with the last place El
Tigre club, while El Toro has to
face the third-place Delta Chi men.
Ii both leaders are victorious, they
will meet for the league champion
ship in their fifth-round game.
Leaders of League V are the
A.K.L.'s and the Phi Delts. They
battle in the fifth round.
