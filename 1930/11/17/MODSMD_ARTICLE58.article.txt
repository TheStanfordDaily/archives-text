# UNIQUE MACHINE FOR LIGHT-RAY STUDY INVENTED
## 
### 
What may prove to be a unique
contribution in study of light-rays
was effected Saturday by the De
partment of Chemistry in completing
the first "vacuum monochromator."
Hitherto scientists have been un
able to subject individual light-rays
of certain wave-lengths to chemical
analysis. The monochromator splits
all light rays between X-ray and
| ultra violet and registers their re
actions to various chemicals.
"The invention will not be pat
ented as that would be contrary to
the research policy at Stanford,"
Assistant Professor Phillip A. Leigh
ton and a co-inventor, stated.
A violent, purplish-appearing
spark carrying 25,000 watts is shot
, into a vacuum box where individual
' rays are isolated by a special type
of prism.
I These segregated rays are then
' conveyed through a tube to a con
tainer in which the particular chem
ical to be studied has been placed.
It is expected that this invention
! will prove to be of great value to
| researchers studying light-rays.
