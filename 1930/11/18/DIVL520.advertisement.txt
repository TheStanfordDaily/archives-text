The FAVORITEij
tobacco of the
Dartmouth man
I
is ...
IF you want to know the Dart
mouth man's favorite tobacco,-
watch him as he loads his pipe be
tween classes in front of Dart
mouth Row. Watch him as he
stroils along Wheelock Street and
pulls the familiar blue tin of Edge
worth out of his pocket.
A pipe and Edgeworth—this is
the smoking combination that has
won the college man. Harvard,
1 Cornell, Michigan, Stanford, Illi
nois ... all agree with Dartmouth.
Natural merit has made Edgeworth
the favorite smoking tobacco in
America's leading colleges and uni
versities.
College men everywhere respond
to the appeal of pipes packed with
cool, slow-burning Edgeworth. Be
guided by their choice; try Edge
worth yourself. Taste its rich nat
ural savor t hat is enhanced immeas
urably by Edgeworth's distinctive
"eleventh process." You will find
Edgeworth at your nearest tobacco
shop — the tin. Or, for gener
ous free sample, address: Larus &
