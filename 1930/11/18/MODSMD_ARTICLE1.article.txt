# WARNER HOLDS SECRET DRILLS FOR BIG DIE
## Final Choice Will Probably Be Team Sent Against Washington U. RAY TANDY STILL OUT 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
Devoting the major part of a long
ractice session to running signals,
'op Warner and his Redshirt grid
len yesterday settled down in a
loud of secrecy to begin the week
112 work which remains before the
Jig Game.
Since it is quite probable that in
his final week the Old Fox is
rjrough with the experimenting on
rst-string lineups which has kept
rid followers guessing throughout
he season, fans can almost be cer
ain that his selection for today's
ractice is the last word.
Lineup Settled
Up to the week before the Husky
It, everyone including the varsity
layers was in the dark as to just
/hich men could be called first
tringers. Though partly due to in
aries, as in the case of Captain Tan
y, most of the shifting done by the
)ld Man was in search of a coniz
ation that would make a smooth
unning machine out of the wealth
112 individual talent.
The outfit that started against the
luskies seems to be the final choice,
ince that lineup composed the
quad that Warner drilled last night:
Inds, Doub and Neill; tackles, Ehr
orn and Bogue; guards, Bardin and
lulen, and at center, Taylor. In the
ackfield was Hillman at quarter,
tothert in the fullback position, and
loffat and Caglieri in the half
erths.
Mar Albertson Out
At present there is only one man
/ho is considered definitely out of
ic Big Game with injuries, and that
; Mar Albertson, second-string cen
r. In the lineup named, a very
oticeable omission is Ray Tandy,
!ard captain, who has been on the
rippled list for the major part of
le season, however, he may get into
ie game.
With a scrimmage likely for to
ay's session, it looks as though Pop
'ill not take any chances on the
'.ears being as decrepit as the Tro
tns and the Huskies made it ap
ear. It is common knowledge that
le Blue and Gold will be striving
> save an otherwise hopeless season
y a glorious upset at the expense
112 the Big Red Machine.

ackfield was Hillman at quarter,
tothert in the fullback position, and
loffat and Caglieri in the half
erths.
Mar Albertson Out
At present there is only one man
/ho is considered definitely out of
ic Big Game with injuries, and that
; Mar Albertson, second-string cen
r. In the lineup named, a very
oticeable omission is Ray Tandy,
!ard captain, who has been on the
rippled list for the major part of
le season, however, he may get into
ie game.
With a scrimmage likely for to
ay's session, it looks as though Pop
'ill not take any chances on the
'.ears being as decrepit as the Tro
tns and the Huskies made it ap
ear. It is common knowledge that
le Blue and Gold will be striving
> save an otherwise hopeless season
y a glorious upset at the expense
112 the Big Red Machine.
Devoting the major part of a long
ractice session to running signals,
'op Warner and his Redshirt grid
len yesterday settled down in a
loud of secrecy to begin the week
112 work which remains before the
Jig Game.
Since it is quite probable that in
his final week the Old Fox is
rjrough with the experimenting on
rst-string lineups which has kept
rid followers guessing throughout
he season, fans can almost be cer
ain that his selection for today's
ractice is the last word.
Lineup Settled
Up to the week before the Husky
It, everyone including the varsity
layers was in the dark as to just
/hich men could be called first
tringers. Though partly due to in
aries, as in the case of Captain Tan
y, most of the shifting done by the
)ld Man was in search of a coniz
ation that would make a smooth
unning machine out of the wealth
112 individual talent.
The outfit that started against the
luskies seems to be the final choice,
ince that lineup composed the
quad that Warner drilled last night:
Inds, Doub and Neill; tackles, Ehr
orn and Bogue; guards, Bardin and
lulen, and at center, Taylor. In the
ackfield was Hillman at quarter,
tothert in the fullback position, and
loffat and Caglieri in the half
erths.
