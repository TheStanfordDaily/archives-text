BERKELEY, Nov. 17. (/P)â€”Mak
ing further charges of professional
ism against the University of South
i ern California, the Daily Californian,
University of California publication,
in an editorial today urged a break
' in gridiron relations with the Trojan
' institution.
W. W. Monohan, graduate mana
ger of the University of California,
said the editorial represented noth
ing but the editor's opinion and had
no official significance whatever.
Monohan said he did not care to
comment further.
Weakness Shown
"If California or Stanford back
clown before Trojan demands for
apologies, they are showing regret
table weakness," said the Daily
Californian editorial. "If any rela
. tions are to be broken it is for us
j to break them.
"Southern California can deny
from now until doomsday, but it
can't explain away its scholastic ir
regularities. And until these are cor
rected, Stanford and California will
;be justified in taking the South-
I erners off their schedule."
