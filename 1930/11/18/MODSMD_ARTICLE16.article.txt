# 'NO DEMOCRACY IN U.S.?' ARGUED
## Debaters Discuss American Politics, No Decision 
### 
"America is ceasing to be a de
mocracy."
This statement formed the major
contention of the English universi
ties team which last night upheld
the affirmative of the question "Re
solved, the principle of democracy
has been tried and found wanting"
in a no-decision debate with a Stan
lord team, before a nearly filled As
sembly Hall.
The Stanford team was composed
of Irving Rosenblatt, Jr., and George
E. Shibley. B. J. Crehan of the Uni
versity of Liverpool and D. Hope
Elletson of St. John's College, Ox
ford, were the members of the Eng
lish universities team. Professor
Payson J. Treat of the history de
partment presided.
The debate was conducted in the
traditional English manner. This
manner permits speeches from the
floor just before the rebuttal.
