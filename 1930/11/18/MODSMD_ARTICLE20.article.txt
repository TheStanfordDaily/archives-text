# BONFIRE WORK WELL STARTED BY MEN OF '34
## Final Work On Platforms And Pyre Foundation Set For Today 
### 
Progress on the bonfire yesterday
was highly satisfactory and a good
turnout of freshmen achieved all the
work planned by the committee for
the day, according to Dick Oddie,
Bonfire Committee member.
A small Austin ditcher was used
for the foundations of the four walls
of the pile, and the digging for the
foundations was completed. The
fences, wire cables, and flood lights
were assembled for night work to
day and Wednesday.
Flood Lights Used
All available material was cut and
assembled. Final work on the foun
dations and platforms for the speak
ers and rally leaders will be com
pleted and building of the main pile
will be well started today.
Work under flood lights will bo
continued throughout the night. Ar
rangements for provision of food for
the workers are being made, and
heavy guards will be set over the
structure during the night.
An appeal to the student body to
co-operate by staying away from
the scene of activity today and
Wednesday in order to allow the
workers to labor unhampered was
made yesterday by Oddie.
