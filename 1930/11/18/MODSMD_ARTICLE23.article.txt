WASHINGTON, D.C., Nov. 17. </p}
Ralph Arnold, California geologist
, and friend of President Hoover,
urged the President today to place
the question of locating a dirigible
I mast in California before the War
I College for decision.
Arnold pointed out that Northern
California had more Congressmen
r than Southern California and said
that as a result had been able to
bring more pressure to bear for lo
cating the mast in the northern sec
tion.
