# CONCERNING EDITORIAL POLICY
## 
### 
In order that students will no longer be mystified with the pro
cedure in the matter of publishing names and non-de-plumes on
communications to the Campus Opinion columns, The Daily an
nounces that the names of all writers of letters will he printed in
the future.
This comes about since readers of The Daily feel the editor
has unfairly used his power. Perhaps, it has never been realized
that every editor of The Daily is entitled to treat contributions to
the Campus Opinion columns as he pleases in view of extenuating
circumstances that might be present.
Communications to the editor will be printed with the name of
the writer appended to the end regardless of the type of letter. Xo
anonymous contributions will be printed.
The Daiia this morning prints two communications in the Cam
pus Opinion column which concern the publication of Gabriel I >is-
< eglia's name as the author of the communication which was pub
lished yesterday. The Dam.y prints these two letters to illustrate
both sides of the question.
