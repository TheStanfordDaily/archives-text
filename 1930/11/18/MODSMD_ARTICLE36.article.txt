# BUILD IT UP, FROSH
## 
### 
Work in earnest on the Big Came bonfire is scheduled to begin
bright and early this morning. With the Ib'g Came rally planned
for tomorrow night, freshmen have less than 3f> hours in which to
erect the giant pyre.
Heretofore, construction work on the bonfire was carried on in
a half-hearted manner for several weeks, and generally ended with
a furious spurt to round out the pile. This year the Kxecutive
i ommittee has lopped off the loafing period, but has left enough
time tit build a sizeable appearing fire if first-year men will co
operate.
liiiilding the bonfire is a real job entailing loss of time and sleep
on the part of workers. I.ut the beauty of the fire when the sparks
leap into the sky tomorrow night, and the traditional symbolism of
the rite should be ample reward for any personal inconvenience.
