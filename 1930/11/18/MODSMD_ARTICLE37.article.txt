# THE 						BIG GAME
## 
### 
Willi the last preliminary luirdle cleared, the Stanford varsity
now will clear decks in preparation for the [Jig (lame next Satur
day. \fter all there is only one I'.ig Game and outcome of Satur
day's same will make the I'M) season a glorious success or an abject
failure.
I'rum the showings against Washington and Caltech. the Cardi
nal team has proved that it has recovered from its early season
sloppiness. and can play the brand of ball for which Warner
coached teams have been noted.
Thus far California has been a sorry sight. W hipped by nearly
every conference opponent, and recently torn within by dissension
and strife, few persons grant the Hears a chance against Stanford.
I>lit the very criticism that has been directed against Coach
I'rice and the California team may awaken the lilue and Gold
eleven from its lethargy. Spectators should not be surprised if a
desperate, vicious, fighting Golden lÂ»ear appears on the field Satur
day.
\nything can happen in a llig Game.
