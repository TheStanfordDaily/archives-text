# THE 						WOMEN MAKE A WISE DECISION
## 
### 
Cnanimous vote of the ten sororities resulted in Pan-Hellenic's
giving official permission to the row sponsors to remain in Koble
through the rushing period if they desire to do so.
Aside from the fundamental wisdom of deciding to let some
one else decide, Pan-Hellenic's action shows a breadth of vision
which is highly desirable. That the "sponsorless" houses should
have joined with the rest of the row in agreeing to let the sponsors
stav is indicative of a general understanding of the purpose and
function of sponsors, and a trust in the sorority women now living
in the hall.
Whether or not the experiment is tried, the Creek women of
the campus have acted wisely in giving their permission to effect the
trial. Women are not so narrow-minded as they are reputed to be!
