# ROW VOTES ON SPONSOR FATE
## Sorority Women May Stay In Hall Two Quarters 
### 
That Row sponsors may remain in
Roble Hall through the winter quar
ter if they so decide was the unani
mous decision of Pan-Hellenic yes
terday afternoon.
The question remains now in the
hands of the sponsor group alone
and will probably be settled next
month. Either all or none of the
Row sponsors will remain, with the
possible exception of Betty Alden,
A.W.S. president, and Marion
Strong, head sponsor.
The problem of a second quarter
in the hall has come up several
times in the past but never has ac
tion been taken early enough to
make it practical. Once, the Row
sponsors remained through the win
ter, but that was in the time of
spring rushing.
"Pan-Hellenic's decision to leave
the matter up to the sponsors them
selves was a very commendable
move," declared Marion Strong,
head sponsor, last night. "It is that
group which will ultimately be able
to decide the question most, wisely.
The sponsors do not feel ready,
however, to form definite opinion
on the subject until later in the
quai'ter when conditions will be
more easily predicted."
