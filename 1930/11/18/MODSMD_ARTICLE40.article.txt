TIIK I'AKADOX OF 'lIIE LUDI
CROUS. ll.v Samuel S. Seward,
Jr. The Stanford University
I'ress. IJJIiO. (At the Stanford
Bookstore.)
The paradox discussed in this
i book is tin* fact that things which
j are imperfect ;md out of place cause
; pleasure in the observer. The author
j says that science is not, at the pres
i ent time, sufficiently advanced to
j discover the causes of such matters,
! and his conclusions are based on
introspection.
There are a number of kinds of
laughter: that of pure exuberance, '
that of victory, and that which re
sults from perception of the ludi
crous. Dr. Seward's thesis is that
the fundamental cause of all of >
these types of laughter is the play
j ful spirit at the different periods of
its development.
Laughter, he points out, .some
limes comes with antipathy and it
I sometimes accompanies sympathy.
But a spirit of happy irresponsi
| bilily and lawlessness is the basis
of laughter from its early manifesta-
I tion in physical well-being to the
i mature delight which comes with i

tile recognition of incongruity.

METEOR. By S. N. Behrmnn. Bren
tano's, N.Y, I MO. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
"Meteor" is written to be staged.
As a result it has the unusual at
traction to the mere reader of mak
ing him use his imagination, thus
"seeing" the play in the lines.
It is u peculiar play, about a pe
culiar young man who could fore
see what was going to happen be
fore it happened. Through the use
of this egotistic confidence he makes
millions, until the inevitable mo
ment when he loses everything, in
cluding his wife whom he loved
sincerely—as much as such a man
could.
The character of Ann, the "pe
culiar young man's wife," is appeal
ing. One .sympathizes with her at
tept to humanize her husband. One
even hopes, for her sake, that she
will succeed.
There is no doubt but that "Me
teor," presented by the Theater
Guild, must be a good play—much
better than the average ones seen
in the West. —J. N.

METEOR. By S. N. Behrmnn. Bren
tano's, N.Y, I MO. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
"Meteor" is written to be staged.
As a result it has the unusual at
traction to the mere reader of mak
ing him use his imagination, thus
"seeing" the play in the lines.
It is u peculiar play, about a pe
culiar young man who could fore
see what was going to happen be
fore it happened. Through the use
of this egotistic confidence he makes
millions, until the inevitable mo
ment when he loses everything, in
cluding his wife whom he loved
sincerely—as much as such a man
could.
The character of Ann, the "pe
culiar young man's wife," is appeal
ing. One .sympathizes with her at
tept to humanize her husband. One
even hopes, for her sake, that she
will succeed.
There is no doubt but that "Me
teor," presented by the Theater
Guild, must be a good play—much
better than the average ones seen
in the West. —J. N.
TIIK I'AKADOX OF 'lIIE LUDI
CROUS. ll.v Samuel S. Seward,
Jr. The Stanford University
I'ress. IJJIiO. (At the Stanford
Bookstore.)
The paradox discussed in this
i book is tin* fact that things which
j are imperfect ;md out of place cause
; pleasure in the observer. The author
j says that science is not, at the pres
i ent time, sufficiently advanced to
j discover the causes of such matters,
! and his conclusions are based on
introspection.
There are a number of kinds of
laughter: that of pure exuberance, '
that of victory, and that which re
sults from perception of the ludi
crous. Dr. Seward's thesis is that
the fundamental cause of all of >
these types of laughter is the play
j ful spirit at the different periods of
its development.
Laughter, he points out, .some
limes comes with antipathy and it
I sometimes accompanies sympathy.
But a spirit of happy irresponsi
| bilily and lawlessness is the basis
of laughter from its early manifesta-
I tion in physical well-being to the
i mature delight which comes with i

tile recognition of incongruity.
