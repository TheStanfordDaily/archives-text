## ANOTHER VIEW OF IT 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
In. view of the fact that the Daily
yesterday printed the name of
Gaberiel Bisceglia as one of the ten
students apprehended as transfer
ring their rooters' tickets and that
he requested his name withheld, it
i is my opinion that Bisceglia did not
represent the nine men and one wo
man who were assessed $2.50 for
violation of their ticket contracts ,
, and any interpretation that he was '
i speaking for them is entirely in
correct.
Furthermore, Bisceglia is not en
titled to any protection of a nom- '
de-plume, after another man had
signed his name to a published cam- |
■ pus opinion. Bisceglia was unwar
ranted in making the assertions he
did. The Daily has been instru
mental in co-operating with the

Rally Committee in its attempts to
clear the rooting section of unde
sirables and its publication of names
was within its rights.
There should be no question of
precedent or fairness involved in the
Daily's printing Bisceglia's name.
The situation was such that to give
Bisceglia any protection by means
of a nom-de-plume would be in
considerate of the other persons in
volved. Also, that to benefit the pub-,
lie welfare, it was best the names
of those students who transferred
their tickets, be printed to provide,
a deterrent in such future cases.
The editor of the Daily is entirely
justified in using his discretion in
printing Bisceglia's name instead of
his nom-de-plume.
