### 
In regard to your editorial of this
morning. Monday, may I remark
that, entirely apart from the merits
i of the case, your action, as editor of
I the Daily, in replying to the criti
cism of a Campus Opinion, written
anonymously, by revealing the name
of the correspondent and making
him the object of an unnecessarily
persona] editorial attack, is decided
ly lacking in fair play?
Although your remarks imply to
the contrary, it has been the cus
tom for students to write to the
J Daily under a nom-de-plume and,
until this morning, it has also been
i the custom, for editors, to respect

> the privilege. When anonymous
writers have complied with the
Daily's condition for publication by
enclosing their names, their com
munications have been either re
jected altogether, or published, as
the writers are entitled to expect
they will be—with the names with
. held.
Your action in revealing Mr. Bis
ceglia's name, and, in publishing, in
heavy type, his request that his
name be withheld, strikes be as
ungentlemanly, trust imposed in
i you as editor of our paper.
Sincerely,
F. B. Carroll, '28.
