# NO MASSACRE INTENDED
## 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
Good old Dink Templeton, %io
doubt with the best of intentions,
has expressed the opinion that an
investigation should be made by
; California and Stanford into the way
Southern California Grade
A football players. And by these
statements we have been dragged
into a somewhat unsavory affair.
1 Without defending the alleged
methods used by U.S.C., I believe
that Ihe majority of students, here,
t have no desire for an investigation.
The manner in which the press has
sensationalized Templeton's state
ment has given the public that im
pression.
Three weeks ago we took our
beating from Ihe Trojans without
crying, no excuses were offered,
none were necessary.
Then last week U.C. took an even
worse beating and immediately put
up a howl and brought forth a
shower of protests, charges, and ac
cusals, not only against U.S.C. but
against their own coach.
The newspapers coupled Temple
-1 ton's casual statement with the la
mentations of the Bears and we
, awoke one morning to find our
selves dubbed "poor sports'' by those
gullible ones who regard the dis
sertations of the sports writers' law.
I believe, such statements not
withstanding, that Stanford this
year, as before, knows how to lose
as well as how to win and that the

] majority, here, have no wish to be
coupled with California in any "after
the massacre" expressions of cha
: grin.
Very truly yours,
John Wells.
