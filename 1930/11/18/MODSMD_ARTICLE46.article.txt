And now another freshman class !
is well under way toward a blis
tered, be-splintered memory of its
first Big Game. And another little
i group of Robleans is having a
chance to tost its powers at making
sandwiches and binding cuts for the
bonfire builders.
Incidentally, here's a lip for
those women: Make yourself
obvious and evident in prepara
tions for the celebration, this
week. Thai's how most feminine
members of the Kally Committee
get their start.
Two Stanford men maintained, in
a debate with English University
students, last night, that, the world

it wanting. We have conclusive

campus.
The messiest, most moth-eaten
moleskins get to parade up the Quad
beside the queeningest Queen of ail
the Five Hundred.
And, obviously, a plebian, cut
down Ford has the only chance
of escape front the jam of cars J

parked by the Library, each
morning; while a most auto
cratic Cord must wait and wait
'for an avenue of exit.
Among numerous other attrac
tions, the Big Game Gaieties boasts,
in its advertising, "an intimate chur
ns." Now, we've always believed in
that old proverb, that "distance
lends enchantment." But intimacy?
. . . Wall,, one never knows, does
one? . . .
We learn, and continue to learn,
but according to the official scheme
of things, we may learn certain
kinds of facts only at the planned
and proper time —no sooner. In one
course which offers a chance for
"cultural improvement," recently,
the lecturer mentioned the name of
a famous Italian church.
One interested student beamed,
"Oh, St. Peter's? Why, thai was
built by "
"Just a minute," the profes
sor interrupted. "St. Peter's
wasn't built till the second quar
ter of this course . . .
