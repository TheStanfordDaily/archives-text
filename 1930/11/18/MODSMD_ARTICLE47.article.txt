According to the Vassar News,
Boston bookstores are complaining
of the censorship. Censorship of
books is the greatest evil that befell
Boston since they lost the title as
"Bean Capital of America."
Now "Banned in Boston" on a
book cover will turn a mediocre
book into the nation's best seller. At
present, pure citizens of this city
. slink across the city limits, purchase
a prohibited volume, and return
home to soak themselves in its for
bidden sensuality.
This procedure is almost as
much sport as swiping one of
Dad's cigars and smoking it in
secret behind the garage. And
Boston's system is just as ado
lescent!
George W. Russel, speaking at the i
University of Washington, claims
that the only advantage to co-educa
tion is that women lend a note of
romance to college. Poet Russel
might alter that statement when he
visits other universities on the Pa
cific Coast.
"A. E." (Russel) is the one who
advocates going back to the farm.
One might agree that going back to
nature is excellent—but for one
week only.
At the University of Copenhagen
students may indulge in as many
cuts as they please. In practice, this
same system exists in America.
Good students don't cut—which is
taking as many cuts as they desire;
poor students cut to their heart's
content and do their repenting when
grades come out.
It is really remarkable how
I many students come to classes

even where no roll is called.
The dean of Hunter College states
that co-eds overstudy and do not
go out enough. This may be true in
institutions where women outnum
ber men but where women students
are in a hopeless (but advantageous)
minority, this condition never takes
place.
Experiments at Columbia Uni
versity are being held to de
termine what emotions are
aroused by various perfumes. A
famous movie actress states that
perfumes should arouse curi
osity. About the only thing that
most perfumes cause is an odor.

same system exists in America.
Good students don't cut—which is
taking as many cuts as they desire;
poor students cut to their heart's
content and do their repenting when
grades come out.
It is really remarkable how
I many students come to classes

even where no roll is called.
The dean of Hunter College states
that co-eds overstudy and do not
go out enough. This may be true in
institutions where women outnum
ber men but where women students
are in a hopeless (but advantageous)
minority, this condition never takes
place.
Experiments at Columbia Uni
versity are being held to de
termine what emotions are
aroused by various perfumes. A
famous movie actress states that
perfumes should arouse curi
osity. About the only thing that
most perfumes cause is an odor.
According to the Vassar News,
Boston bookstores are complaining
of the censorship. Censorship of
books is the greatest evil that befell
Boston since they lost the title as
"Bean Capital of America."
Now "Banned in Boston" on a
book cover will turn a mediocre
book into the nation's best seller. At
present, pure citizens of this city
. slink across the city limits, purchase
a prohibited volume, and return
home to soak themselves in its for
bidden sensuality.
This procedure is almost as
much sport as swiping one of
Dad's cigars and smoking it in
secret behind the garage. And
Boston's system is just as ado
lescent!
George W. Russel, speaking at the i
University of Washington, claims
that the only advantage to co-educa

romance to college. Poet Russel
might alter that statement when he
visits other universities on the Pa
cific Coast.
"A. E." (Russel) is the one who
advocates going back to the farm.
One might agree that going back to
nature is excellent—but for one
week only.
At the University of Copenhagen
students may indulge in as many
cuts as they please. In practice, this
same system exists in America.
