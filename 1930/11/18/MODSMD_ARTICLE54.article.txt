ISLUK WITHOUT GOLD
After the Colifornia-U.S.C. game,
Vic Ludewig, Sports Editor of the
Daily Californian, said: "Next Sat
urday's game against Nevada should
tell the talc, if it hasn't already been
told. A smashing victory might re
store the lost confidence; a close
game and . . . well, just another
year without a Big Game serpentine.
Not since Warner took over the
helm of the Stanford varsity lias
California copped a Big Game clash
—not since 1923 have the Blue and
Gold cohorts scampered across the
turf in a serpentine to stop before
the silent rooting section of the
Cardinals.
In fact, not since 1922 has the
Berkeley Memorial Stadium seen
California serpentine, while the
Sons of the Stanford Red have
danced with glee across the "turf"
of the field in 1926. Two ties in '24
and '28 are the best that the Bears
have gained in six years ol' combat.
The Stanford howl lias been more
fortunate, for in 1!)25, 15)27. and 1929
red and white rooters' caps have
sailed over the cross-bars of the
goal-posts, while the men from the
shadow of the Campanile stood mute
in their scction. mustering up voice
enough to sing their hymn.
Crippled, cracked, crushed, and
cruelly mistreated, the California
Bear will stalk majestically from
his lair Saturday. Given not a ghost
of a show against the superior Stan
ford system, we predict lhat the
students at the state institution will
be proud of their football team be
fore that game is over.
In Ted Beckett, Captain Handy,
Ilank Shaldach, Rusty Gill, Russ
Avery, and Dolph Timmerman the
Bears have men who will light to
their hist breath. It is a ruined son
son which stares these men in the
face, and the Big Game offers them
their last chance to redeem what
they may from the wreckage.
Horatius at the bridge—the Spart
ans at Thermopalae—California vs.
Stanford in 1930. It requires plenty
of the well-known intestinal forti
tude to go out there before 78,000
pairs of eyes and take a beating like
a man—to go out and fight simply
to hold down the score.
Ami not only are the Bears crip
pled because their stars have in
curred injuries in the battles of the
past, hut the question of Price's
ability has arisen to split the team
into two camps. Injuries and inter
nal distention on the eve of the Big
Game! Twin obstacles sufficient to
blast the hopes of staunchest sup
porters.
At the end of the 1929 football
season, the avowed aim of the Cali
fornia varsity became '"Beat Stan
ford." It became the war-cry of
spring practice, the hymn of hate
during early season—but the bat
tering the Bears have received has
blighted the battle-cry.
But old man Psychology, that
much-abused bogie man, hides be
hind the scenes. He can dream of
an over-confident Cardinal crew, an
inspired Bear, and a Big Game up
set. Such is not beyond the realms
of possibility—the poor showing of
the Blue and Gold team may well
cause the Cardinals to grow care
less.
After all, the Big Game is still the
Bit* Game. There is nothing Stan
ford wants more than a decisive de
feat of the Bears. This year the op
timistic supporters may even dream
of a new high-score record—but a
clean-cut victory over California
will look well on the record books.
