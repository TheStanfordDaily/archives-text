SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY
STEEL under
the microscope
Burnished mirror-bright, etched in an
acid-bath, a shiny square of steel is placed
in the projector microscope in the metal
lography room at Crane laboratories.
To the layman, the texture disclosed is
surprising as the filigree design of magni
fied .snowflakes. Sometimes it is like a
relief map of mountain ranges, sometimes
like finely veined marble, sometimes like
cumulous clouds.
But to the scientist in metals who judges
it with a connoisseur's eye, the surface
tells a far wider story. It discloses coarse
uneven or beautiful fine grains, tells of
disproportions and proportions of con
stituents in the alloy, speaks volumes
concerning malleability, ductility, hard
ness . . . gives a key to action of the metal
in service, all based upon knowledge of
the product.
Careful metallographic records of all
medals used in Crane valves and fittings,
painstaking microscopic examination of
all new metals offered for possible use,
are a part of the check and double check
and triple check which is routine in Crane
research and manufacturing.
The full story of Crane application of
chemistry and science to metals is told in
afascinating book," Pioneering in Science."
It is a valuable reference book for students.
