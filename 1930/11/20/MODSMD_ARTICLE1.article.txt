# Cardinals Rest For Bear Game At Quiet Farm
## Warner s Redshirts In Better Than Usual Condition For Big Game; Mar Albertson Only Player Definitely Out; Captain Ray Tandy Ready OLD FOX ANNOUNCES NO STARTING LINE-UP 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
WITH the final oiling of the Big Red Machine completed in a light work
out which terminated a half hour before the usual time, Pop Warner
and his band of 52 Redshirted warriors last night immediately after the
rally departed for the Family Farm near Woodside, to remain hidden from
the outside world until they trot onto the Berkeley Stadium turf before
79,000 rabid grid fans Saturday.
Though the team will return to the campus for a little limbering up
this afternoon behind the high green fence of the varsity practice lot, it

wall amount to little more than a
warming up to keep the men in
shape.
Cards In Good Shape
The Warner-coached outfit will
enter the fracas in better physical
condition than has ever blessed the
Card chances in former years. The
only man definitely out of the Big
Game is Mar Albertson, second
string center.
Although if Perry Taylor were
injured in the early stages of the
fray Albertson's absence might be
noticed in the Stanford forward
wall, Pop has McLeod, who has re
cently been shifted from guard to
the center berth and looked plenty
good in last week's scrimmage
against the Grays.
Bill Marks will also be at the beck
and call of the Old Man, as will Bob
Milligan, who was shifted from the
Gray outfit in mid-season after
Taylor's injury caused a shortage
of center talent.
Tandy To Start
Though the condition of Captain
Ray Tandy has been causing con
siderable concern among Farm sup
porters, it is probable that he will
start. If he should weaken early in
the game, Chuck Ehrhorn will get
the call, and from the manner in
which he has held down the right
tackle berth since Tandy's injury
it would appear that his presence
will not worry Cardinal rooters.
Reports in the city papers to the
contrary, the Old Fox has not an
nounced his starting lineup for the
Coast gridiron classic. Though all
the combinations named in San
Francisco papers to start for the
Cards include Simkins at full in
stead of Rothert, it cannot be con
sidered final till Warner makes his
official announcement today. .
Tonight the California Bears will
attend their annual Blue and Gold
smoker rally in the Harmon gymna
sium and immediately afterward
proceed to the Castlewood Country
Club to rest in quiet seclusion un
til they are called upon Saturday at
2 o'clock to attempt the seemingly
upset victory over
the favored Cardinals.

WITH the final oiling of the Big Red Machine completed in a light work
out which terminated a half hour before the usual time, Pop Warner
and his band of 52 Redshirted warriors last night immediately after the
rally departed for the Family Farm near Woodside, to remain hidden from
the outside world until they trot onto the Berkeley Stadium turf before
79,000 rabid grid fans Saturday.
Though the team will return to the campus for a little limbering up
this afternoon behind the high green fence of the varsity practice lot, it

wall amount to little more than a
warming up to keep the men in
shape.
Cards In Good Shape
The Warner-coached outfit will
enter the fracas in better physical
condition than has ever blessed the
Card chances in former years. The
only man definitely out of the Big
Game is Mar Albertson, second
string center.
Although if Perry Taylor were
injured in the early stages of the
fray Albertson's absence might be
noticed in the Stanford forward
wall, Pop has McLeod, who has re
cently been shifted from guard to
the center berth and looked plenty
good in last week's scrimmage
against the Grays.
Bill Marks will also be at the beck
and call of the Old Man, as will Bob
Milligan, who was shifted from the
Gray outfit in mid-season after
Taylor's injury caused a shortage
of center talent.
Tandy To Start
Though the condition of Captain
Ray Tandy has been causing con
siderable concern among Farm sup
porters, it is probable that he will
start. If he should weaken early in
the game, Chuck Ehrhorn will get
the call, and from the manner in
which he has held down the right
tackle berth since Tandy's injury
it would appear that his presence
will not worry Cardinal rooters.
Reports in the city papers to the
contrary, the Old Fox has not an
nounced his starting lineup for the
Coast gridiron classic. Though all
the combinations named in San
Francisco papers to start for the
Cards include Simkins at full in
stead of Rothert, it cannot be con
sidered final till Warner makes his
official announcement today. .
Tonight the California Bears will
attend their annual Blue and Gold
smoker rally in the Harmon gymna
sium and immediately afterward
proceed to the Castlewood Country
Club to rest in quiet seclusion un
til they are called upon Saturday at
2 o'clock to attempt the seemingly
upset victory over
the favored Cardinals.
