# NO GOOD-WILL ASSEMBLY TO BE HELD-PIKE
## Custom To Be Discontinued This Year Because Of Student Attitude 
### 
Discard of good-will assemblies
from the program of interscholastic
relations between Stanford and the
University of California this year
i has resulted from negotiations be
| tween the executives of the two
I student body governments instigated
| by Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president,
i "The Stanford standpoint on the
proposal to hold the customary ex
i change of student presidential ad
! 'dresses before all-university assem
blies of the rival institutions, was
I based upon the apparent student at
< ;titude toward such activities here,"
Pike stated.
i | "The comparatively small amount
of interest shown in the recent
U.S.C. good-will gathering indicated
i that the Stanford student body, if
i not opposed to such gestui'es, is at
least indifferent on the matter," he
continued. "Whole-hearted student
support is vital to the success of
such assemblies, and when it is not
! forthcoming, it is far. better that
I the# should not be undertaken."
The A.S.S.U. head asserted that
j the conclusion of his negotiations
with Stern Altshuler, president of
j the California student body, was ar
rived at with complete understand
i ing and lack of ill-feeling on both
sides.
