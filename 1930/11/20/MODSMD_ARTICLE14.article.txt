# FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF POWER
## 
### 
(Editorial)
Action of the California Executive Committee in the ex
pulsion of Arthur Arlett as editor of The Daily Calif or nian is
a flagrant violation of the rights of the student press.
If Editor Arlett chose to say what he did say he had a
perfect right to do so. He accepted the responsibility and
should be charged with it. The Executive Committee of the
University of California did not and never was responsible.
Hiding behind the mask of silence the Executive Commit
tee members refused to explain their action. If they felt they
were justified in their act they would have made public some
explanation.
Students at the University of California should demand
special elections and recall their Executive Committee. The
students should not stand by and watch campus politicians
crucify their editor when there is a cause at stake.
