# Flaming Campanile Brightens Campus For Annual Rally
## Pop Warner, Tandy, Cutler, Fuller, And Harris Speak; Public Address System Used; Indian Drum Shown For First Time; Chant Song 
### 
AUTLINED against a spark-studded sky a replica of the Berkeley Cam
panile went up in crackling flames last night while four thousand
leather-lunged sons and daughters of Stanford vented the Cardinal spirit
in lusty yells. Despite difficulties with the amplifiers, Kenneth Mcßae,
chairman of the Rally Committee succeeded in introducing the first
speaker, Coach Pop Warner.
Pop spoke on the psychology of the under-dog and said that the team
was not going to have a snap on Saturday. He asked the team and the

s> student body to co-operate to vin
| dicate their coach in the eyes of his
j critics.
Tandy Speaks
Captain Ray Tandy was then in
| frodueed and complimented the stu
j dent body on their show of spirit,
i pleading for a hangover of the same
j on Saturday.
; The end of Tandy's speech was
j the signal for the first appearance
of the Stanford Indian Drum, which
i was borne in on the heads of Scalp
; ers, its legal guardians. The Drum
; Song was sung and given an enthu
j siastic encore. It was announced that
I the Drum would be "down in front"
i at the Big Game Saturday.
| Check Presented To Martin
Leland Cutter, 'O6, spoke next and
i confessed his complicity in the pres
-1 ent fine state of the Stanford band.
|He spoke feelingly of Professor
! "Pop" Martin, whom he acclaimed
jas "All-American E Flat Cornet
I Player!" Vociferous applause greet
ed the presentation of a book of
| appreciative letters and a substan-
I tail check to Professor Martin.
Mcßae then introduced W. P.
j Fuller, "The man who provided 100
| gallons of red paint to paint the
i Campanile red." After disparaging
remarks on the subject of L. W.
"Larry" Harris, the next speaker,
who was introduced as the "witticist
of the program," Fuller regained his
seat.
The crowd's enjoyment of the fol
lowing witticisms was rudely inter
rupted by the untimely lighting of
the bonfire, which was soon well
ablaze.
As the Campanile swayed
finally toppled over to glorious ruin
the crowd gave a "Skyrocket," sang
"Sons of the Stanford Red," and
broke up to serpentine joyously
around the burning embers of the
pyre, shouting vengeance and death
to. 'the Blue and Gold.
Stanford's "newly-found relic,"
the much-acclaimed Indian Drum,
made its bow to the strident body
last night at the Big Game rally.
Held aloft by members of Scalpers,
sophomore honorary society, the
drum was displayed in all its
gleaming red glory.
As a torn, torn, torn was beat from
its sides—which are five feet wide,
if proud members of Scalpers are
to be believed—the new Indian
chant was sung.
In search of a new job since the
axe will not be taken out of its
vault, Scalpers, which is the official
organization for safe-guarding the
axe, has taken it upon itself to be
responsible for the drum. It will be
displayed in front of the rooting
at the Big Garife as an ac
companiment for the chant.
