# Theta Violation Of Pan-Hellenic Rule Considered
## Committee To Recommend Penalty Today 
### 
For the illegal bidding of Veva
Jane Haehl by Kappa Alpha Theta,
a joint committee appointed yester
day by, Meta Jury, acting president
of Pan-Hellenic, will recommend a
penalty to a special meeting of that
body this afternoon at 5:15 o'clock.
The members of the committee for
investigation and recommendation
of penalty are: Dean Mary Yost;
Meta Jury, acting president and
Kappa Kappa Gamma representa
tive; Helen Halderman, senior mem
ber for Pi Beta Phi; Elizabeth Stu
art, senior member for Delta
Gamma; and the president of the
alumnae council, to be elected this
afternoon by alumnae representa
tives of the ten sororities.
The clause of the bidding contract
which was violated follows:
Contract Violated
"Bidding of old girls living at
Roble shall take place at the end
of autumn quarter, and after formal
bidding in winter quarter."
A special meeting of Pan-Hellenic
was held yesterday afternoon at the
request of Jean Utt, president and
Theta member of that body, al
though, according to the bidding
contract, no official action could be
taken beyond the appointment of
the joint committee. Meta Jury,
vice-president, assumed the chair
due to the fact that the president
is a member of the offending house.
The question of whether or not
the bidding was secret followed a
presentation of the Theta case by
Anne Frick, house president.
"The penalty for secret bidding,"
reads the Pan-Hellenic bidding con
tract, to which Jean Utt was a party,
"shall be the losS of the bidding
privilege by the sorority for the fol
lowing year." Should the joint com
mittee consider the offense a case
of secret bidding, such a suspen
sion of privilege would be auto
matic. If, however, it is determined
after investigation by the committee
that the bidding was not secret, the
penalty will be named by the com
mittee.
