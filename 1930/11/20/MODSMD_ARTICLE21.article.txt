## EX COMMITTEE SILENT ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS Final Editorial Directed Against Committee For Broken Precedent TERM ENDS IN 2 WEEKS 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 19. i/hâ€”Arthur
Arlett,- militant editor of the Daily
Californian, student publication, was
summarily removed tonight by the
University of California Executive
Committee.
The committee acted late tonight
after a prolonged session. Members
of the committee, all but two of
whom are students, refused to dis
cuss the editor's removal.
Arlett, in an editorial appealing
in the Daily Californian on Novem
ber 10, following California's 74-0
defeat by the University of Southern
California, raised questions concern
ing the athletic situation at Berke
ley, including the competency of
Coach C. M. ''Nibs" Price.
The editorial aroused a storm of
comment on the California campus
and throughout the Bay Region,
which was quieted when the student
Executive Committee in its meet
ing a week ago voted full confidence
in Price and the team.
Favored Break With S.C.
Since that time Arlett has directed
his editorial attention to criticizing
the athletic practices of the Uni
versity of Southern California,
recommending that athletic relations
be broken by California and Stan
ford with the southern institution.
His editorials in Che Daily Califor
nian attacked particularly the laxity
of scholastic requirements at U.S.C.
He wrote his last editorial tonight
in the final edition of the Californian
which he will edit, In this editorial
Arlett turned his criticism from col
legiate football to the Executive
Comittee, which he said broke all
precedent in trying to dictate the
policies of the Daily Californian.
His removal from office came
scarcely two weeks before his edi
torial career would have naturally
expired.
