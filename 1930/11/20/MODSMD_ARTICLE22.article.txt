# P. G. AND E. BASES CONSTRUCTION PLAN ON RYAN LAB WORK
## 
### 
On the basis of tests made at the
Ryan Laboratory on the experi
mental power line which was erect
ed last fall on 12 113-foot steel
towers, the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company will expend $600,000 on its
new 160-mile Tiger River to Newark
power line. According to this deci
sion 100 miles of copper and 60
miles of aluminum conducting cable
will be used.
The short power line at the Ryan
Laboratory was built for the pur
pose of making tests on various
types of insulators and conductors.
The transformers of the laboratory
are capable of producing as high as
1,000,000 volts although an alternat
ing current of only 300,000 volts was
used on this experiment.
The steel towers the line were
donated by the Pacific Coast Steel
Company and the expenses incurred
in the erection were covered by
money provided by the Pacific Coast
power companies.
