So-called student body "leaders" at the University of California,
quaking for fear that the recent editorial campaign of The Daily
Calif'orman concerning the athletic situation there might be con
strued as authorized by them have seen fit to place a censorship on
the Californian.
Although The DAILY has been content to watch the recent charges
and Counter-charges between California and University of Southern
California only as an interested spectator, this pitiful attempt to
muzzle the student press comes as an admittance that President
Stern Altshuler and his California Executive Committee members
are purely politicians endeavoring to further their own ends and not
those of the studeftts of University of California..
The DAILY, it must be remembered, does not take a stand one
way or the other on the repent controversy aroused by editorials
printed in The Californian.
The issue at stake is the censorship of the press. Editor Arthur
Arlett, who is to be commended for saying what he had to say in
spite of opposition, had a perfect right to print what he believed to
be legitimate editorial opinion.
Censorship of the student press would result in such feeble jour
nalistic efforts that it would be needless to call universities as expo
nents o'f liberal and free thought.
The DAILY condemns the action of the California Executive
Committee and hopes the censorship will be removed as hastily as it
was applied.
