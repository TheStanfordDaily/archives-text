# TWO CO-EDS
## 
### 
From the University of Washington comes the amazing story
O'f two co-eds and the extremes in the values of the clothes they wear
each day on the Seattle campus.
For one, $566 worth of clothing is the dtyly rule. For the other,
apparel costing $40.80 suffices.
Hat, coat, dress, shoes, stockingsâ€”ss66. It rather takes one's
-breath away. The same outfit at $40.80 sounds a bit better to us..
While nearly everyone strives for nice clothes, a Western uni
versity campus is, perhaps, the extreme in democracy and infor
malitv. Certainly a $566 display seems unnecessary.
