j TOP SPEED—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Joe E. Brown's mouth would make
any picture a howling success, even
j if the plot and scheme of the entire
show were all wrong. The Brown
j mouth with a fishing pole—the
! Brown mouth with a golf club—with
i a catch phrase, wrth Bernice Claire,
[ with anything—is sure to draw
j shrieks of laughter from its audi
j ence.
I This time, Joe goes fishing; he
i splurges and spends a week-end at
! a too-expensive hotel; he falls nois
ily in love; he saves the day at the
j important motor boat races. Or, at
i least, we're sure he would have
saved the day if he hadn't been
; doing some speed-boating of his
own. And counting sheep? Joe
shows you the real reason for the
: invention of that famous sport.
The good-looking fill-in hero has
a pleasing voice, and looks like
j somebody's high-school ideal". Ber
! nice Claire is the best proponent of
| the song-and-dance interlude we'.ve
! seen in months. The seriousness is
i not too overdone, and the comedy
j lines are tremendously successful. It
i is to laugh. —M. L. J.

QUIET STREET. By Michael Ossor

1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
| It is with a microscopic eye that
I Michael Ossorgin in "Quiet Street"
| examines the vast panorama of Rus

sian life.
In. a book that contains real
beauty the Russian writer tells of
the slow and tranquil passing of the
days in the house of one of his chief
characters, the learned Ivan Alex
androvitch, the sudden coming of
the War, the Revolution, of death
and poverty, and the still slow drift
ing away of time.
Nothing is too small to escape the
comprehension of Ossorgin. The
mouse undermining the house in
that quiet street where Alexandro
vitch lives, the nail rusting in its
roof, alike are observed as playing
their part in the ceaseless disinte
gration of the universe. —J. McG.
GIRL OF THE GOLDEN WEST—
At the Varsity Theatre.
With Ann Harding in the title
role, an ordinary western melodrama
becomes unusual entertainment.
Without that gorgeous blonde
creature with the slightly husky
voice, "Girl of the Golden West"
would be nothing more than the old
series of wild rides, barroom scenes,
and shooting, with a near-hanging
for the climax.
With her, the old hokum takes on
a new appearance, .and in places is
actually gripping. Louise Fazenda
inj the same role, without changing
the story a bit, would make it an
uproarious farce.
Certainly this is an excellent ex
ample of a star making a picture,
and should be a strong argument for
the star system. —L. M. C.

GIRL OF THE GOLDEN WEST—
At the Varsity Theatre.
With Ann Harding in the title
role, an ordinary western melodrama
becomes unusual entertainment.
Without that gorgeous blonde
creature with the slightly husky
voice, "Girl of the Golden West"
would be nothing more than the old
series of wild rides, barroom scenes,
and shooting, with a near-hanging
for the climax.
With her, the old hokum takes on
a new appearance, .and in places is
actually gripping. Louise Fazenda
inj the same role, without changing
the story a bit, would make it an
uproarious farce.
Certainly this is an excellent ex
ample of a star making a picture,
and should be a strong argument for
the star system. —L. M. C.
j TOP SPEED—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Joe E. Brown's mouth would make
any picture a howling success, even

j mouth with a fishing pole—the
! Brown mouth with a golf club—with
i a catch phrase, wrth Bernice Claire,
[ with anything—is sure to draw
j shrieks of laughter from its audi
j ence.
I This time, Joe goes fishing; he
i splurges and spends a week-end at

QUIET STREET. By Michael Ossor

1930. (At the Palo Alto Book

| It is with a microscopic eye that
I Michael Ossorgin in "Quiet Street"
| examines the vast panorama of Rus

sian life.
In. a book that contains real
beauty the Russian writer tells of
the slow and tranquil passing of the
days in the house of one of his chief
characters, the learned Ivan Alex
androvitch, the sudden coming of
the War, the Revolution, of death
and poverty, and the still slow drift
ing away of time.
Nothing is too small to escape the
