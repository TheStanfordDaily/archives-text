[ After yelling ourselves completely
i voietdess at the rally last night,
j we're feeling almost enthusiastic
j about this football game scheduled
: for Saturday, rain or no discomfort.
A little bit of yelling goes a great
deal farther in the Pavilion—but it
was a sort of selfish custom, when
so many people had to be excluded.
And it was darned hard on the ear
drums of the boys up in front, who
! were being yelled at.
In accordance with Stanford his
i tory—the destruction and restora
j tion of ISO 6, it might be more ap
propriate to represent the Campa
nile being thrown down by an
earthquake. Then the boxes could
be used all over again, our most
advertised-celebration-of-the-quar-
ter would be recounted as a "bene
fit," and we'd be philanthropists, at
last.
Incidentally, it would be lots
harder for marauding enemies to
import an effective earthquake
than the traditionally dreaded

! box of matches. No?
| And now we have it on good au
thority that "modern football is
more deadly than melieval warfare."
There's another boost for keeping
1 training rules—at least if that rule
| means death for the other side. Me
