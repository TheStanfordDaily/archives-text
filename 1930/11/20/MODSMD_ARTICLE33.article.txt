• The Editor, Sir:
In order that the entire blame for
; illegal transference of tickets shall
I not be shifted onto a small group
I again, it is clear that a suitable plan
| should be adopted for the accurate
• checking of each rooter's ticket
j holder at every reserved seat game.
! Therefore a set of rules has been
j devised which is absolutely fool
| proof and at the same time most
| simple in operation.
To begin with, all applications
j shall be turned in by the applicant
in person at the B.A.C. office where
the student, in the presence of a
bonded employee of the 8.A.C., shall
i sign the application, and, in a spe
• cial space provided on the blank,
1 place his fingerprint.
| In due time hp obtains his rooter's
ticket, differing, from the present
| design in that a space is left for
! signature and fingerprint, and an
! extra "stub" is attached.
Then on entering the stadium
j gate, after the first stub has been
1 removed, he shall step up to a desk
where another finger impression,
this time on the previously signed
| ticket, is made and this portion of
| the ticket is detached. The student
i shall then pass to a second man
, who wipes his thumb for him with
i a damp cloth and thanks him for
his co-operation. (This checking
j operation should in no case take
more than 10 seconds, thus no ma
terial delay should result.)
The fingerprints shall be checked
j the following Monday by a force of
j unemployed policemen at the ex
| pense of the A.S.S.U. and the stu
dent shall be notified of his trial
; date by registered special delivery
mail not later than Wednesday.
It is recommended that: a first
conviction shall carry a fine equal
: in amount to the mailing fee, plus 15
per cent, of the notification letter; a
second conviction shall carry a fine
based on a sliding scale which shall
j take into account the number of
! quarters attended by the student
and the indebtedness at that date of
j the 8.A.C.; a third conviction shall
i carry the penalty of life forfeiture
!of the ticket privilege. '
