# CAPTAIN REQUESTS RETURN OF WHEEL
## 
### 
I Captain E. C. Williams of the mili
tary department, requests that the
i party who borrowed a wheel from
a pushcart belonging to the military
! department will kindly return same
j immediately. The captain suggests
that as one wheel can be of little
| use to either party it would be ad
visable to reunite them. A wrench
! overlooked by the borrower will be
j gladly exchanged for the returned
| wheel.
