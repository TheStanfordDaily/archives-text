When the final gun pops in the
Berkeley Memorial Stadium Satur- j
day, it is the hope and prayer of ;
every Cardinal that a new high in !
Bed stock will be read from the |
scoreboard, and a score wiping that j
38-0 margin of victory for U.C. will
he established.
But this high-score record is a
hope, a wish—and the translation of i
it into reality can be no easy feat, j
For) the Bears will be fighting for a j
great many things—a great many j
issues will be thrown up to them in 1
that pre-game dressing room fight j
talk.

Primarily there is Price. "It's not |
your fault—this disastrous season— j
you've worked hard, fought, played |
to the best of your ability. I guess j
I'm a failure—l've made you look i
like a bunch of bums." What effect i
would that sort of talk have on the i
Golden Bears?
__<Sj <s..
There is aiways the desire to take j
Stanford, the only means by which j
a hopeless Season can be salvaged; ;

breaking.

With never a Big Game victory
to his credit, with the majority of i
the alumni and half of the student
body hoping for his resignation— .
how much confidence can Nibs Price
inspire in his men, how well can
they rally their shattered forces for
a comeback if they are scored upon
early in the game?
_<£-s>_
Inexperience, the handicap of the
Bear eleven, weighs heavily upon
the Blue and Gold backs in face of
the coming cannonade of Card
passes; while the offense of Cali
fornia will be bnilt around men who
have played together for three or
four weeks at the most.
_.<s><»>_
Reserves? Who will replace Eich
meyer at center if he is forced from
the game? How many able-bodied
quarterbacks can the Bears put on
the field? Who will run the team,
who will play safety? After Grif
fiths, Shaldach, Valianos, and East
all partially crippled—who are the
halfbacks?
All these are problems for Nibs
to solve, while Warner finds his
squad in the best shape it has been
for some time. With but Mar Al
bertson definitely out, with Tandy
alone whose condition may be
branded as at all questionable,
Stanford has a fit squad for the Big
Game.
If the Stanford line outplays the
California forward wall by as wide
a margin as it did a year ago—well,
it will be a memorable Big Game
for all concerned. If not,, it may be
more of a ball game than California
hopes. —L. K., Jr.
