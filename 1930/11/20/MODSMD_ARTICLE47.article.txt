# STANFORD FENCER WINS FIRST PLACE IN LEAGUE TOURNEY
## 
### 
Richard Criley, '34, member of
the Stanford fencing squad, won the
fencing championship at the handi
cap tournament held at the Olympic
Club in San Francisco last Friday,
sponsored by the Bay Division of
the Amateur Fencing League of
America.
This was Criley's first experience
in competition. Although he was
given a substantial handicap such a
win showed much fencing ability,
according to Elwyn Bugge, fencing
coach.
George Eastman, another member
of the fencing squad, reached the
semi-finals of the contests. These
two men were competing as indi
viduals and not as members of any
Stanford team.
