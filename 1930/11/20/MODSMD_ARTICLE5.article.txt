# U.S.C. OFFICIAL DISMISSES GRID TEAM MEMBER
## Soph Halfback Expelled For Falsification Of Entrance Record 
### 
! What may be the first step in a
1 general athletic "housecleaning" in
Pacific Coast Conference circles was
i taken last night when H. C. Willett,
j faculty athletic representative of the
] University of Southern California,
! revealed that George Kirkwood,
1 sophomore and substitute halfback
|on the Trojan football team, had
j been dismissed from school for fal-
I sification of entrance records and
! using an assumed name.
An Associated Press dispatch from
| Los Angeles disclosed that Trojan
j authorities had discovered that Kirk
! wood, whose real name is said to be
j George S. Purvis, played two years
(for College of Puget Sound, Wash
| ington, before entering Southern
! California as a freshman in 1929.
False Records
Purvis last night admitted that he
i obtained entrance into U.S.C. by
! having his Tacoma, Wash., high
I school principal forward his creden
j tials tb the southern institution un
| der the name of Kirkwood.
j Willett said that he was forward
i ing a statement of Purvis' ineligibili
| ty to all members of the Pacific Coast
; Conference, and sending a list of the
j athletic contests in which he had en
! gaged this year to Professor W. B.
S Owens, of Stanford, president of the
1 conference.
No Action Possible
j Owens, questioned last night, said
■ that no action could be taken in the
! event that Kirkwood had partici
pated in any conference games this
| season, as that body has no retroac
| tive ineligibility rule.
! Coming on the heels of the recent
' flurry of charge and counter-charge
j anent professionalism of athletes, the
action of the Trojan authorities may
be the forerunner of a general in
vestigation of athletic conditions at
Southern California, target for most
! of the attacks.
Although both the University of
! California and Stanford officials have
emphatically disclaimed any accusa
| tions of subsidization and tampering
with scholarship standards at U.S.C.,
! unofficial charges have been hurled,
! first by Arthur M. Arlett, editor of
j the DAILY CALIFORNIAN, and
• Robert L. "Dink" Templeton, Stan
| ford track coach.
Arlett has since been muzzled by
! action of the California Executive
: Committee, and Templeton has made
' no further comment.
