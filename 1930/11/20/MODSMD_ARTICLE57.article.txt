# PEEL ANTAGONIZES INDIAN DELEGATES AT LONDON PARLEY
## Promise Of Independence Denied By England In Peel's Speech 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 19. (/P).- —Declara-
tions of Earl Peel, former conserva
tive Secretary of State for India, be
fore the Indian Table Confer
ence yesterday, has greatly disap
pointed and even antagonized some
of the visiting Indian delegates to
proceedings.
Practically all of these, subjects of
British India and native Indian
princes alike, came here with the at
tainment of immediate dominion
status for India the absolute mini
mum of their demands, and to them
Lord Peel's declaration that England
had never promised India immediate
dominion status came as a great
shock.
At least one more blast of the same
nature is looked for from the Mar
quess of Reading, former Viceroy of
India, who is known to feel as Lord
Peel that the day is far distant when
India can safely be made an auton
omous part of the British Common
wealth.
A torrent of Indian extremist de
mands for "independence" or for im
mediate "dominion status" and the
broadsides of charges of British op
pression poured from two Indian
radical spokesmen at the Round Ta
ble Conference on Indian affairs to
day.
One of these was Dr. B. S. Moon
jee, a Hindu. The other was Mo
hammed Ali, a Moslem. Their clash
ing creeds appeared to have been
forgotten in a common indictment of
British policy.
Their impassioned appeals recalled
the oratory of the American revolu
tion and Mohammed Ali declared
that unless he could return to a free
India he would prefer to die in a
foreign land.
