# RECENT DISCOVERY GIVES BASIS FOR EVOLUTION THEORY
## Skulls Found In China Have Qualities Of Man And Ape, Says Smith 
### 
"Recent discovery of two skulls j
near Pekin, China, having both hu
man and ape-like characteristics I
now gives us solid fact on which to
base assertions concerning human j
evolution," was the statement made !
by Dr. Grafton Elliot Smith in a ■
lecture given yesterday in the Little
Theatre on the subject of "Recent
Discoveries in the Evolution of
Man." ;
Dr. Smith stated that study of the !
remains indicated that the newly 1
discovered man of the early Pleisto- !
cene period is probably a direct an- j
cestor of present-day man.
Pekin oi* Sinanthropus man's out- j
standing features are the large bony |
eyebrow ridges which give him an ;
•unusually brute-like appearance, j
and the great bulge of the skull in j
the temple region, indicating that
this ancient man probably had the
power of speech, Dr. Smith said. I
Dr. Smith illustrated the lecture j
with slides.
