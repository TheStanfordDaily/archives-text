## 
### 
J Stanford's lone source of drinking
! water springs from a 500-foot well
j adjacent the cactus gardens which
i has for 13 years been tended by 67-
year-old Michael Dornberger, native
of Alsace-Lorraine.
Dornberger migrated to Mayfield
in 1880 where he kept an engineer
ing trade until he accepted the posi
tion in 1917 of maintaining the elec
trical pumps used on the well. He
remembers the early days when
Stanford was a farm and Palo Alto
was but a railroad siding. At that
time Senator Stanford had two
racetracks, one near the polo field,
the other by the Roble gym.
! Water pumped from this well goes
| directly into the mains, and the
| overflow is directed to the reservoir
j on the Hoover Hill.
