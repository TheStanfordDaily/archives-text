# GRADUATION TO THIN RANKS OF FOOTBALL MEN
## Backfield Loses Rothert, Clark, Simkins; Four Men Leave Line NEW STARS AWAITED 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
While about this time of the year
the performance of the Cardinal
varsity grid team during the pi'es
ent season is paramount in interest
of the fans, a few stop to consider
what the future holds in store for
War ner - coached outfits.
Many have voiced opinions con-

cerning what will
be turned out by
the Old Fox in the
way of Big Red
Machines in years
to come since the
cut in the number
of freshmen en
tering Stanford.
Some have been
quite concerned

over the "handwriting on the wall'
as it appeared in defeats of the
freshman eleven at the hands oi the
Bear and Trojan babe teams.
While we are not prepared to dis
cuss what the situation might be in
three, four, or five years from now,
we do know just who Warner is
going to lose for the 1931 model of
his Card machine.
In the backfield, Pop will be with
out 'the services of Harlow Rothert,
who had carried so much of the bur
den for Stanford this year. Like
wise, Bill Clark and Bill Simpkins
will be lost from the Farm grid
roster. Laird, who jumped into the
limelight after the Bruin game this
year, is listed as having already had
two years of competition, but there
is some uncertainty in his case.
In the line, Tandy, Bardin, Bogue
and Taylor will be the chief losses,
while K. Albertson, Burke, and
Bush, who have alternated consid
erably in the Card first-string line
this year will also be missing.
Thus out of what we judge from
the starting lineups of ihe Southern
California and Washington contests
are considered first stringers by
Warner, the two tackles, Tandy and
Bogue, Bardin at guard, Taylor at
center, and Rothert at full will leave
vacant spaces for Pop to fill next
year.
For Captain Tandy's tackle posi
tion, the Old Fox will have Ehr
horn, who has kept Tandy working
plenty hard all season for the berth,
and who started in the Husky tilt.
For the guard position that Bardin
will vacate, Hand, Dawson, Hunt
and Heiser will be on hand. To take
Bogue's place we find that Laborde
and George and "Nellie" Grey will
be on deck next year.
Caglieri, Hillman and Moffat will
all be eligible to perform in the 1931
Card backfield. while Rintala, Allen,
Lambert, Wilson, Caddel, and Hardy
should also be on hand. Rothert is
the only one of the backs who
started against Southern Califoinia
to be missing, and with Caddel and
Rintala showing a lot of class this
year, Pop should not find himself
shy of ball carriers.
However, at this early stage it is
impossible to predict what eleven
men are likely to be running in the
first string lineup. There will be ex-
Grays fighting for positions, notably
AfTlerbaugh. a back, and Clark, a
tackle; there will be J.C. transfers,
and ex-freshmen gridders, and then
lots of things might happen between
now and next Autumn to this year's
varsity players who plan to return.

Grays fighting for positions, notably
AfTlerbaugh. a back, and Clark, a
tackle; there will be J.C. transfers,
and ex-freshmen gridders, and then
lots of things might happen between
now and next Autumn to this year's
varsity players who plan to return.

While about this time of the year
the performance of the Cardinal
varsity grid team during the pi'es
ent season is paramount in interest
of the fans, a few stop to consider
what the future holds in store for
War ner - coached outfits.
Many have voiced opinions con-

cerning what will
be turned out by
the Old Fox in the
way of Big Red
Machines in years
to come since the
cut in the number
of freshmen en
tering Stanford.
Some have been
quite concerned

over the "handwriting on the wall'
as it appeared in defeats of the
freshman eleven at the hands oi the
Bear and Trojan babe teams.
While we are not prepared to dis
cuss what the situation might be in
three, four, or five years from now,
we do know just who Warner is
going to lose for the 1931 model of
his Card machine.
In the backfield, Pop will be with
out 'the services of Harlow Rothert,
who had carried so much of the bur
den for Stanford this year. Like
wise, Bill Clark and Bill Simpkins
will be lost from the Farm grid
roster. Laird, who jumped into the
limelight after the Bruin game this
year, is listed as having already had
two years of competition, but there
is some uncertainty in his case.
In the line, Tandy, Bardin, Bogue
and Taylor will be the chief losses,
while K. Albertson, Burke, and
Bush, who have alternated consid
erably in the Card first-string line
this year will also be missing.
Thus out of what we judge from
the starting lineups of ihe Southern
California and Washington contests
are considered first stringers by
Warner, the two tackles, Tandy and
Bogue, Bardin at guard, Taylor at
center, and Rothert at full will leave
vacant spaces for Pop to fill next
year.
For Captain Tandy's tackle posi
tion, the Old Fox will have Ehr
horn, who has kept Tandy working
plenty hard all season for the berth,
and who started in the Husky tilt.
For the guard position that Bardin
will vacate, Hand, Dawson, Hunt
and Heiser will be on hand. To take
Bogue's place we find that Laborde
and George and "Nellie" Grey will
be on deck next year.
Caglieri, Hillman and Moffat will
all be eligible to perform in the 1931
Card backfield. while Rintala, Allen,
Lambert, Wilson, Caddel, and Hardy
should also be on hand. Rothert is
the only one of the backs who
started against Southern Califoinia
to be missing, and with Caddel and
Rintala showing a lot of class this
year, Pop should not find himself
shy of ball carriers.
However, at this early stage it is
impossible to predict what eleven
men are likely to be running in the
first string lineup. There will be ex-
Grays fighting for positions, notably
AfTlerbaugh. a back, and Clark, a
tackle; there will be J.C. transfers,
and ex-freshmen gridders, and then
lots of things might happen between
now and next Autumn to this year's
