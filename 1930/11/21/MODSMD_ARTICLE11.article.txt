# BANDS FURNISH COLOR IN GAME
## Musical Organization Has Had Steady Growth 
### 
Flashing across the green field of
! California Memorial Stadium tomor
| row, the vividly arrayed bands of
i Stanford and California will con-
I tinue a rivalry as ancient and as ea-
I gerly contested as the Big Game it-
I self.
Marching through the most in
; tricate formations, their crossing and
1 re-crossing a veritable maze to fol
low, ranks swinging smartly as if
; on invisible axles, cardinal and white
uniforms, always a striking contrast
to the green velvet turf, the Stan
. ford Band will set a high criterion
of performance for their Blue and
; Gold contemporaries to follow.
Professor Earnest Whitney Martin,
for twenty years a member of the
' band and since 1915 its director,
promises that this year's display by
! the Cardinals will rival that, of the
! last Big Game when complicated
i stunts novel and strange to the Pa
; cific Coast were presented by the
Stanfordites.
A history of the band includes an
almost continuous story of enlarge- j
; ment. At its inception in 1893 it :
numbered a mere 33, little less than j
j a third the size of the present or- j
| ganization.
For the Big Game of 1921, 64 men !
j appeared on the field against the
1 clan of Blue and Gold note and scale
| men. By 1924, the organization had |
I increased to 75 men. The next year
I the band was enlarged to 104 where
|it remained until this year when
| Stanford will take the field with 112
j musicians. '

| cleat scarred battle ground at tomor
j row's game, every Stanford alumni

. ford Band will set a high criterion
of performance for their Blue and
; Gold contemporaries to follow.
Professor Earnest Whitney Martin,
for twenty years a member of the
' band and since 1915 its director,
promises that this year's display by
! the Cardinals will rival that, of the
! last Big Game when complicated
i stunts novel and strange to the Pa
; cific Coast were presented by the
Stanfordites.
A history of the band includes an
almost continuous story of enlarge- j
; ment. At its inception in 1893 it :
numbered a mere 33, little less than j
j a third the size of the present or- j
| ganization.
For the Big Game of 1921, 64 men !
j appeared on the field against the
1 clan of Blue and Gold note and scale
| men. By 1924, the organization had |
I increased to 75 men. The next year
I the band was enlarged to 104 where
|it remained until this year when
| Stanford will take the field with 112
j musicians. '
When the towering veteran Drum
j Major William "Red" Okker and his
! capable assistant, Marsdon Sherman,
i lead Aanford's Band out on that old i
| cleat scarred battle ground at tomor
j row's game, every Stanford alumni
I and student may feel proud of these
cardinal and white clad men.
