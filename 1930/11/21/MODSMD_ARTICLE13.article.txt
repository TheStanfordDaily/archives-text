# Seven Will Play Final Game For Bears Tomorrow
## Price Must Build 1931 Line Around Fritz Cahn 
### 
Two ends, a pair of guards, a
i tackle, and a center, California's en
tire first string line with one excep
tion, will play their last game for the
| Golden Bear tomorrow, leaving Fritz
Cahn at right tackle as the sole reg
ular lineman around whom Coach
"Nibs" Price can build his 1931
1 varsity football squad.
Russ Avery, Ellis Thornton, Cap
tain Carl Handy, Ted Beckett, Dolph
Timmerman, and Herman Eickmeyer
—could any coach watch the grad
' uation of such a formidable group of
: men without a certain amount of
1 gloom? Add Clarence "Moose" Gar
rity veteran half-back, to this list
and you may well imagine the
Berkeley mentor's feelings.
Plenty of Ends
However, with such likely pros
pects as Stone, Bartlett, Vhyte, De-
Bennedetti, and Dißesta, Price
should be able to find a pair of
wingmen to take the place of Avery
and Taylor. Then, Frank Medanieh,
the plucky center who turned in
such good work during the few
minutes he played in the game with
U.S.C., should step into Eickmeyer's
i shoes without causii>g very much
i worry to California fans.
At tackle, DelGiorgio and Easter
brooks have shown up well this
! year, while Fritz Cahn and Mai
Coombs, who was injured early in
the season, each have another year
of competition before them.
The guard position appears to be
the weakest in California's outlook.
Beckett and Captain Handy have
had such a monopoly at flanking the
center this year, that no substitute
has been given the chance to show
his mettle as yet. Elerding, Donald
Handy, Sam Gill, Trotter, and Wat
l son have all played a little.
Lack Guard
In the backfield California sup
| porters have little to worry over.
The combination of speed, power,
, elusiveness, and passing and punting
| ability that are to be found in the
playing of such men as Shaldach,
| Valianos, East, Kirwan, Gill, Grif
fiths, McCutcheon, Potter, Scely,
j Castro, and Watkins, all of whom
! return next year, constitutes a val
uable asset to any football team.
Then, there will be the addition
of talent from the strong freshman
aggregation of this year to brighten
Blue and Gold hopes, so California
should have material for a football
team in 1931.

Lack Guard
In the backfield California sup
| porters have little to worry over.
The combination of speed, power,
, elusiveness, and passing and punting
| ability that are to be found in the
playing of such men as Shaldach,

fiths, McCutcheon, Potter, Scely,
j Castro, and Watkins, all of whom
! return next year, constitutes a val
uable asset to any football team.
Then, there will be the addition
of talent from the strong freshman
aggregation of this year to brighten
Blue and Gold hopes, so California
should have material for a football
team in 1931.
Two ends, a pair of guards, a
i tackle, and a center, California's en
tire first string line with one excep
tion, will play their last game for the
| Golden Bear tomorrow, leaving Fritz
Cahn at right tackle as the sole reg
ular lineman around whom Coach
"Nibs" Price can build his 1931
1 varsity football squad.
Russ Avery, Ellis Thornton, Cap
tain Carl Handy, Ted Beckett, Dolph
Timmerman, and Herman Eickmeyer
—could any coach watch the grad
' uation of such a formidable group of
: men without a certain amount of
1 gloom? Add Clarence "Moose" Gar
rity veteran half-back, to this list
and you may well imagine the
Berkeley mentor's feelings.
Plenty of Ends
However, with such likely pros
pects as Stone, Bartlett, Vhyte, De-
Bennedetti, and Dißesta, Price
should be able to find a pair of
wingmen to take the place of Avery
and Taylor. Then, Frank Medanieh,
the plucky center who turned in
such good work during the few
minutes he played in the game with
U.S.C., should step into Eickmeyer's
i shoes without causii>g very much
i worry to California fans.
At tackle, DelGiorgio and Easter
brooks have shown up well this
! year, while Fritz Cahn and Mai
Coombs, who was injured early in
the season, each have another year
of competition before them.
The guard position appears to be
the weakest in California's outlook.
