# CARD AXE, STOLEN IN '99. RECOVERED BY VALIANT GROUP
## Band From Sequoia Secured Traditional Trophy By Strategy 
### 
The Big Game of 1898, California's
first football victory over Stanford,
marks the inception of the Axe as
a concrete symbol of Stanford spirit.
Previous to this the Axe existed
alone in the yell, "Give 'e mthe axe,"
originated in 1896.
Following the first Big Game de
feat, it was decided that the Axe
should take definite form. In San
Francisco was procured an immense
broad axe with a ten-pound head
and a fifteen-inch blade. A block
"S" painted on the head which was
mounted on a five-foot handle made
a complete and formidable weapon.
Axe Dull
Defeats in athletic contests that
year had left the blade dull and
nicked by the time spring and the
baseball season had arrived. After
the Cardinal had gone down, 4 to 1,
in the first game of the two out of
three series with Berkeley, a giant
rally, the largest that had ever been
held on the campus, was arranged.
On April 13, 1899, Stanford sup
porters gathered before the biggest
bonfire which to that date had ever
blazed here, and heard Frank Eng
lish, '01, now a San Francisco at
torney, give a legal and literary re
cital on the causes of the dullness of
the Axe. It was unanimously de
cided that the weapon should be
sharpened for the second game of
the baseball series that coming Sat
urday. After application to a grind
stone, the blade was tested on the
neck of an effigy of a California sym
pathizer and found to be in perfect
condition.
California Wins
Either the sharpness of the edge
was overestimated or the weapon
could not be wielded fast enough,
for the red machine was again de
feated by California in the second
game. Not until nearly a week after
the game, did the Daily Palo Alto
calmly mention in its editorial col
umns something of "The Axe which
we gave them on last Saturday and
failed to take from them on Mon
day."
Not until the following day did
the paper finally carry the actual
story of the theft of the Axe, which
was of much more lasting signifi
cance than the loss of the baseball
championship of 1899. Three Stan
ford men had privately taken the
weapon to the game at the Sixteenth
and Folsom Street grounds and pa
raded it before the rooters.
Weapon Stolen
After the game, the three who
were escorting the Axe back to the
campus found themselves surround
ed by enemy rooters. In the ensu
ing fight the Stanford men were
overpowered and famous old blade
passed into the hands of the Berke
leyans, where it remained until
April of this year, 31 years follow
ing its original loss.
Attempts to regain it have been
clever and daring, but in each in
stance save one doomed to frustra
tion. More than once did Stanford
men have the historical symbol of
university spirit in their hands, but
in each case events failed to happen
as they had been expected to or
some part of the plot failed to
"click" properly and the Axe hacl to
be relinquished to the Californians.
Home Again!
On April 3, 1930, 21 residents of
Sequoia Hall, organized by Don
Kropp, '29, set out for the Berkeley
campus where the annual Axe Rally
preparatory to the Spring sports
season was to be held in the Greek
Theatre. The men had been drilled
in an elaborate and detailed plot—
each man had certain duties and re
sponsibilities essential to the success
of the entire plan which he had to
perform.
Following the rally, the cherished
trophy was carried to the door of
the American Trust Company at
Berkeley in an armored car, for Cal
ifornia, made weary by the nearly
successful attempts to recapture the
Axe in the past, had adopted the
policy of keeping it in a bank vault
and transporting it in a safety car.
An auto standing near the bank with
a fake movie camera mounted in the
back seat was the sole witness of
the arrival of the armoured car.

Home Again!
On April 3, 1930, 21 residents of
Sequoia Hall, organized by Don
Kropp, '29, set out for the Berkeley
campus where the annual Axe Rally
preparatory to the Spring sports
season was to be held in the Greek
Theatre. The men had been drilled
in an elaborate and detailed plot—
each man had certain duties and re
sponsibilities essential to the success
of the entire plan which he had to
perform.
Following the rally, the cherished
trophy was carried to the door of
the American Trust Company at
Berkeley in an armored car, for Cal
ifornia, made weary by the nearly
successful attempts to recapture the
Axe in the past, had adopted the
policy of keeping it in a bank vault
and transporting it in a safety car.
An auto standing near the bank with
a fake movie camera mounted in the
back seat was the sole witness of
the arrival of the armoured car.

The Big Game of 1898, California's
first football victory over Stanford,
marks the inception of the Axe as
a concrete symbol of Stanford spirit.
Previous to this the Axe existed
alone in the yell, "Give 'e mthe axe,"
originated in 1896.
Following the first Big Game de
feat, it was decided that the Axe
should take definite form. In San
Francisco was procured an immense
broad axe with a ten-pound head
and a fifteen-inch blade. A block
"S" painted on the head which was
mounted on a five-foot handle made
a complete and formidable weapon.
Axe Dull
Defeats in athletic contests that
year had left the blade dull and
nicked by the time spring and the
baseball season had arrived. After
the Cardinal had gone down, 4 to 1,
in the first game of the two out of
three series with Berkeley, a giant
rally, the largest that had ever been
held on the campus, was arranged.
On April 13, 1899, Stanford sup
porters gathered before the biggest
bonfire which to that date had ever
blazed here, and heard Frank Eng
lish, '01, now a San Francisco at
torney, give a legal and literary re
cital on the causes of the dullness of
the Axe. It was unanimously de
cided that the weapon should be
sharpened for the second game of
the baseball series that coming Sat
urday. After application to a grind
stone, the blade was tested on the
neck of an effigy of a California sym
pathizer and found to be in perfect
condition.
California Wins
Either the sharpness of the edge
was overestimated or the weapon
could not be wielded fast enough,
for the red machine was again de
feated by California in the second
game. Not until nearly a week after
the game, did the Daily Palo Alto
calmly mention in its editorial col
umns something of "The Axe which
we gave them on last Saturday and
failed to take from them on Mon
day."
Not until the following day did
the paper finally carry the actual
story of the theft of the Axe, which
was of much more lasting signifi
cance than the loss of the baseball
championship of 1899. Three Stan
ford men had privately taken the
weapon to the game at the Sixteenth
and Folsom Street grounds and pa
raded it before the rooters.
Weapon Stolen
After the game, the three who
were escorting the Axe back to the
campus found themselves surround
ed by enemy rooters. In the ensu
ing fight the Stanford men were
overpowered and famous old blade
passed into the hands of the Berke
leyans, where it remained until
April of this year, 31 years follow
ing its original loss.

California Wins
Either the sharpness of the edge
was overestimated or the weapon
could not be wielded fast enough,

game. Not until nearly a week after

calmly mention in its editorial col

we gave them on last Saturday and

day."
Not until the following day did
the paper finally carry the actual
story of the theft of the Axe, which
was of much more lasting signifi

championship of 1899. Three Stan

weapon to the game at the Sixteenth
and Folsom Street grounds and pa
raded it before the rooters.
Weapon Stolen
After the game, the three who

Home Again!
On April 3, 1930, 21 residents of
Sequoia Hall, organized by Don
Kropp, '29, set out for the Berkeley
campus where the annual Axe Rally
preparatory to the Spring sports
season was to be held in the Greek
Theatre. The men had been drilled
in an elaborate and detailed plot—
each man had certain duties and re
sponsibilities essential to the success
of the entire plan which he had to
perform.
Following the rally, the cherished
trophy was carried to the door of
the American Trust Company at
Berkeley in an armored car, for Cal
ifornia, made weary by the nearly
successful attempts to recapture the
Axe in the past, had adopted the
policy of keeping it in a bank vault
and transporting it in a safety car.
An auto standing near the bank with
a fake movie camera mounted in the
back seat was the sole witness of
the arrival of the armoured car.

The Big Game of 1898, California's
first football victory over Stanford,
marks the inception of the Axe as
a concrete symbol of Stanford spirit.
Previous to this the Axe existed
alone in the yell, "Give 'e mthe axe,"
originated in 1896.
Following the first Big Game de
feat, it was decided that the Axe
should take definite form. In San
Francisco was procured an immense
broad axe with a ten-pound head
and a fifteen-inch blade. A block
"S" painted on the head which was
mounted on a five-foot handle made
a complete and formidable weapon.
Axe Dull
Defeats in athletic contests that
year had left the blade dull and
nicked by the time spring and the
baseball season had arrived. After
the Cardinal had gone down, 4 to 1,
in the first game of the two out of
three series with Berkeley, a giant
rally, the largest that had ever been
held on the campus, was arranged.
On April 13, 1899, Stanford sup
porters gathered before the biggest
bonfire which to that date had ever
blazed here, and heard Frank Eng
lish, '01, now a San Francisco at
torney, give a legal and literary re
cital on the causes of the dullness of
the Axe. It was unanimously de
cided that the weapon should be
sharpened for the second game of
the baseball series that coming Sat
urday. After application to a grind
stone, the blade was tested on the
neck of an effigy of a California sym
pathizer and found to be in perfect
condition.
