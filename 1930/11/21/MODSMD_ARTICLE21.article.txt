University of California, announced
j the university had purchased the fa

a picture of the Axe. As he stepped
from the car, an overloaded shot of
flashlight powder was discharged
blinding flash, and from the top of
the car Stanford men, who had
mixed with the "freshman guard"
for the weapon, fell upon him.
The trophy was wrenched from
Horner's hands and passed from man
to man till it reached Bob Loofbou
row, '29, who tucked it calmly be
neath his weater and stepped into
the waiting car. In 50 minutes, the
Axe, for 31 years absent, was again
on the Stanford campus, and an im
promptu rally was under way. Those
men who remained in Berkeley min
gled with the U.C. students and
slowed them in organizing for the
persuit.
The ruse had been completely suc
cessful, though the Berkeley men
searched the Stanford campus all
night, removing only some harmless
trophies which were subsequently
returned. The Axe remained in its
Stanford hiding place.
I The famed trophy now rests in the
1 vaults of the American Trust Com
pany in Palo Alto, where it must re
main until officials of the University
deem it wise to remove it. If put on
display at present, it would un
doubtedly cause rioting which might
endanger lives or property, the Ad
ministration declares. To remove the
Axe from the musty recesses of the
bank vault would be merely to in
vite an attack from the school to the
North, which might menace the
friendly athletic relations between
the two institutions.

Horner's hands and passed from man
to man till it reached Bob Loofbou
row, '29, who tucked it calmly be
neath his weater and stepped into
the waiting car. In 50 minutes, the
Axe, for 31 years absent, was again
on the Stanford campus, and an im
promptu rally was under way. Those
men who remained in Berkeley min
gled with the U.C. students and
slowed them in organizing for the
persuit.
The ruse had been completely suc
cessful, though the Berkeley men
searched the Stanford campus all
night, removing only some harmless
trophies which were subsequently
returned. The Axe remained in its
Stanford hiding place.
I The famed trophy now rests in the
1 vaults of the American Trust Com
pany in Palo Alto, where it must re
main until officials of the University
deem it wise to remove it. If put on
display at present, it would un
doubtedly cause rioting which might
endanger lives or property, the Ad
ministration declares. To remove the
Axe from the musty recesses of the
bank vault would be merely to in
vite an attack from the school to the
North, which might menace the
friendly athletic relations between
the two institutions.
