# "DINK'S" IMPRESSIVE TRACK AND FIELD ARRAY HERALDS CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON
## 
### JACK JERNEGAN 
Stanford's gridiron warriors were
not able to make much of an im
pression last month on the Trojan
horde from U.S.C., but a glance at
Coach Dink Templeton's track and
field hopefuls now working out on
the Old Oval gives heart to a lot of
somewhat downcast Cardinal sup
porters.
So impressive is the array of ma
terial on hand for the 1931 track
team that many campus critics are
already looking for a championship
season, like those of 1927, 1928, and
1929, in the course of which Dean
Cromwell's boys from dear old
Southern Cal will receive the short
end of a sizeable score.
Past Records Good
To convince such doubting Thom
ases as may be encountered, the ar
dent track enthusiasts on the Farm
are already becoming adept at flash
ing a list of men and past perform
ances that carries plenty of convic
tion.
100 yard dash—Hector Dyer, (V),
did 9.6 last year to beat Frankie
Wykoff and is already shading 10
fiat this year; Les Hables, 9.8, a fine
competitor; Giberson (V), better
than 10 fiat; Howell (V), better than
10 flat; Lombardi, 9.6.
220 yard dash—All of the above.
Dyer has done 21.5 in this race.
440 yard dash—Eastman, 48.1.
(Done as a freshman last year.) This
boy has great possibilities of im
provement and is being looked to
for a new world's record in a year
or two; Ike Hables (V), 48.8, should
be improving with experience;
Shove, (V), 49 flat; Les Hables, 48.8;
Rogers, 51 flat.
880 yard run—Storms, 1:58, ineli
gible last year, but a very promis
ing runner; Cooper (V), 2:00 flat;
Neikirk (V), under that time, not
out last year, but ran well in 1929;
Fullenwider, 2:01, from last year's
freshman team; Nay lon, 2:01, also
from the frosh.
Mile run—Storms, 4:30, expected
to cut his time by 10 seconds before
the end of this season; Brown (V),
something of an unknown quantity
since he has only run the mile once
or twice.
Two mile—Parker (V), 9:53; Hun
ter, from the '33 team; Albersold, 10
minutes flat.
High hurdles—Smith (V) captain
of the team, 15 flat; Brugman V);
Nesbit (V), Gordon.

Low hurdles—Smith (V), 24.4;
Nesbit (V); Herbert, 25 Hat, from
the l'rosh team.
Shot put—George Grey (V), 47
feet, 11 inches; Laborde, 46 feet, 11
inches; Nellie Gray, 46 feet, 4 inches;
all of these boys should show a lot
of improvement.
Discus throw—Nellie Gray, 153
feet, not bad at all for a sophomore;
Laborde, 147 feet; George Grey (V),
152 feet; Tandy, (V), 146 feet; Jones
(V), 145; McLeod (V), 143 feet.
High jump—Blackman, 6 feet,
one-half inch; Woodyatt, 5 feet il
inches; Austin (V), 6 feet, West (V),
6 feet, 1 inch.
Broad jump—West (V), 24 feet
7 3-4 inches, made this mark plac
ing second in I.C. 4-A last year;
Butler (V), better than 23 feet; War
der, a new man who has been doing
23 feet with a bad leg.
Pole vault —Deacon, 13 feet; Johns,
13 feet; De Groot (V), 12 feet, 6
inches, expected to show a lot of
improvement.
Javelin throw—Zuger, 196 feet, a
new development who ought to fill
this weak spot pretty well; Gold
smith and Deacon are other possi
i bilities.
Relay—Les Hables, Ike Hables,
Shove, Eastman, and what a team
; that is! Those boys are due to crack
the college record made last year
plenty hard. Adding up their times
for the 440 distance gives a result
somewhere around 3:14 flat.
It looks like a fine spring, mates!

all of these boys should show a lot
of improvement.
Discus throw—Nellie Gray, 153
feet, not bad at all for a sophomore;
Laborde, 147 feet; George Grey (V),
152 feet; Tandy, (V), 146 feet; Jones
(V), 145; McLeod (V), 143 feet.
High jump—Blackman, 6 feet,
one-half inch; Woodyatt, 5 feet il
inches; Austin (V), 6 feet, West (V),
6 feet, 1 inch.
Broad jump—West (V), 24 feet
7 3-4 inches, made this mark plac
ing second in I.C. 4-A last year;
Butler (V), better than 23 feet; War
der, a new man who has been doing
23 feet with a bad leg.
Pole vault —Deacon, 13 feet; Johns,
13 feet; De Groot (V), 12 feet, 6
inches, expected to show a lot of
improvement.
Javelin throw—Zuger, 196 feet, a
new development who ought to fill
this weak spot pretty well; Gold
smith and Deacon are other possi
i bilities.
Relay—Les Hables, Ike Hables,
Shove, Eastman, and what a team
; that is! Those boys are due to crack
the college record made last year
plenty hard. Adding up their times
for the 440 distance gives a result
somewhere around 3:14 flat.
It looks like a fine spring, mates!
Stanford's gridiron warriors were
not able to make much of an im
pression last month on the Trojan
horde from U.S.C., but a glance at
Coach Dink Templeton's track and
field hopefuls now working out on
the Old Oval gives heart to a lot of
somewhat downcast Cardinal sup
porters.
So impressive is the array of ma
terial on hand for the 1931 track
team that many campus critics are
already looking for a championship
season, like those of 1927, 1928, and
1929, in the course of which Dean
Cromwell's boys from dear old
Southern Cal will receive the short
end of a sizeable score.
Past Records Good
To convince such doubting Thom

or two; Ike Hables (V), 48.8, should
be improving with experience;
Shove, (V), 49 flat; Les Hables, 48.8;
Rogers, 51 flat.
880 yard run—Storms, 1:58, ineli
gible last year, but a very promis
ing runner; Cooper (V), 2:00 flat;
Neikirk (V), under that time, not
out last year, but ran well in 1929;
Fullenwider, 2:01, from last year's
freshman team; Nay lon, 2:01, also
from the frosh.
Mile run—Storms, 4:30, expected
to cut his time by 10 seconds before
the end of this season; Brown (V),
something of an unknown quantity
since he has only run the mile once
or twice.
Two mile—Parker (V), 9:53; Hun
ter, from the '33 team; Albersold, 10
minutes flat.
High hurdles—Smith (V) captain
of the team, 15 flat; Brugman V);
Nesbit (V), Gordon.

Low hurdles—Smith (V), 24.4;
Nesbit (V); Herbert, 25 Hat, from
the l'rosh team.
Shot put—George Grey (V), 47
feet, 11 inches; Laborde, 46 feet, 11
inches; Nellie Gray, 46 feet, 4 inches;
all of these boys should show a lot
of improvement.
Discus throw—Nellie Gray, 153
feet, not bad at all for a sophomore;
Laborde, 147 feet; George Grey (V),
152 feet; Tandy, (V), 146 feet; Jones
(V), 145; McLeod (V), 143 feet.
High jump—Blackman, 6 feet,
one-half inch; Woodyatt, 5 feet il
inches; Austin (V), 6 feet, West (V),
6 feet, 1 inch.
Broad jump—West (V), 24 feet
7 3-4 inches, made this mark plac
ing second in I.C. 4-A last year;
Butler (V), better than 23 feet; War
der, a new man who has been doing
23 feet with a bad leg.
Pole vault —Deacon, 13 feet; Johns,
13 feet; De Groot (V), 12 feet, 6
inches, expected to show a lot of
improvement.
Javelin throw—Zuger, 196 feet, a
new development who ought to fill
this weak spot pretty well; Gold
smith and Deacon are other possi
i bilities.
Relay—Les Hables, Ike Hables,
Shove, Eastman, and what a team
; that is! Those boys are due to crack
the college record made last year
plenty hard. Adding up their times
for the 440 distance gives a result
somewhere around 3:14 flat.
It looks like a fine spring, mates!
Stanford's gridiron warriors were
not able to make much of an im
pression last month on the Trojan
horde from U.S.C., but a glance at
Coach Dink Templeton's track and
field hopefuls now working out on
the Old Oval gives heart to a lot of
somewhat downcast Cardinal sup
porters.
So impressive is the array of ma
terial on hand for the 1931 track
team that many campus critics are
already looking for a championship
season, like those of 1927, 1928, and
1929, in the course of which Dean
Cromwell's boys from dear old
Southern Cal will receive the short
end of a sizeable score.
Past Records Good
To convince such doubting Thom
ases as may be encountered, the ar
dent track enthusiasts on the Farm
are already becoming adept at flash
ing a list of men and past perform
ances that carries plenty of convic
tion.
100 yard dash—Hector Dyer, (V),
did 9.6 last year to beat Frankie
Wykoff and is already shading 10
fiat this year; Les Hables, 9.8, a fine
competitor; Giberson (V), better
than 10 fiat; Howell (V), better than
10 flat; Lombardi, 9.6.
220 yard dash—All of the above.
Dyer has done 21.5 in this race.
440 yard dash—Eastman, 48.1.
(Done as a freshman last year.) This
boy has great possibilities of im
provement and is being looked to
for a new world's record in a year

Shove, (V), 49 flat; Les Hables, 48.8;
