# BAY POLICE DIRECT PARKING AT STADIUM
## 
### 
Parking for the Big Game in
Berkeley tomorrow will be handled
almost entirely by poliee officers of
the Bay Region. Cars will be parked
I in the city in the vicinity of the sta
r dium, but due to a large area which
has been left around the stadium
for pedestrians, all cars will have to
be parked at some distance away.
For games at Stanford, student
crews of from 27 to 325 men handle
all the parking of automobiles. At
the last U.S.C. game it was estimated
that there were approximately 16,-
000 cars on the campus. For the pre
, liminary games, numbers ranged
i from 2,500 to 6,000 cars.
