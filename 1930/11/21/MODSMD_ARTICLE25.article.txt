# MALONEY BOASTS OF LONG RECORD WITH UNIVERSITY
## Director Of Minor Sports Familiar With Every Form Of Game 
### 
Twenty-two years a Stanford
coach with only a single break; thaf
is the record of Harry Maloney, di
rector of minor sports, and dean in
years of service of the University's
athletic staff.
Since he came here in 1908, Ma
loney has been active at one time
or another in almost every branch
of athletic activity which Stanford
has offered and has been instru
mental in the development of many
sports. Several members of the
Board of Athletic Control staff who
are at present holding forth on the
Farm owe their training to Maloney's
coaching during their undergrad
uate days.
Sport Training
Starting as an instructor in physi
cal education, Maloney quickly be
came connected with all sports in
the University. In 1911 the students
appointed him trainer for all ath
letic teams, which position he held
for several years until forced to give
it up because of his coaching work.
During this period, however, he es
tablished himself so firmly in popu
larity with the students that ever
since he has been the most gener
ally - liked man in the Stanford
coaching staff.
Soccer got.its initial impetus here
in 1910 from Maloney, who coached
it steadily until 1917, during which
time he never lost a game to Cali
fornia. After the World War, he re
sumed the coaching job and in 1920-
21-22 turned out elevens which
played a total of 42 straight games
without a defeat. Incidentally, Grad
uate Manager A 1 Masters of the
Board of Athletic Control was goal
keeper on the 1922 team.
War Veteran
With the outbreak of the Great
War, Maloney went to the officer's
training camp in San Francisco and
was commissioned a captain because
of his previous experienced gained
during the Boer War in South Af
rica. Later he was assigned to the
Stanford unit and then to Camp Fre
mont in the hills back of the cam
pus.
He went to France with the Bth
Division, and after the Armistice
was appointed head coach of the
American track team for the Inter-
Allied games. His team won the
meet by an overwhelming score. It
was at this time that Maloney came
in contact with Gene Tunney, for
mer heavyweight boxing champion,
who was in France with the A.E.F.
I.C. 4-A Team
On his return to Stanford in 1919
Maloney took over the track coach
ing job temporarily. He took a three
man team composed of Morris Kirk
sey. Dink Templeton, and Jess Wells,
back to the I.C. 4-A and won sixth
place with it. Kirksey, star sprinter,
pulled a muscle in the trials and
was forced to withdraw, so it was
really a two-man team which com
peted.
Stanford collected 15 points on a
first place, a second, and two thirds.
Wells beat Earl Thompson in the
low hurdles in 23 4-5, one fifth of
a second slower than world's record.
Thompson had just set the high

hurdles record at 14 2-5, which still
stands.
Rugby Team
Harry was appointed coach and
trainer of the American Olympic
Rugby team for the 1920 games at
Antwerp. The squad of 22 had 11
Stanford men on it and won the
Olympic championship under Ma
loney's leadership.
He was again appointed to that
position for the 1924 Olympic games,
but Stanford had been invited to
send a tennis team on a tour of Aus
tralia, and he decided to manage
and coach that team instead of going
to Paris, President Wilbur having
personally requested him to do so.
Australian Tour
That team, composed of Ted
Mertz, Dick Hinckley, Normal De
Back, and Harold Overvelt, travelled
21,000 miles in four months, the
longest trip ever made by a Stanford
team.
Offered a position as assistant
coach and trainer of the American
track team fo rthe 1928 Olympic
games at Amsterdam, Maloney was
unable to accept on account of a
teaching program in which he v/as
engaged during the summer quar
ter.

I.C. 4-A Team
On his return to Stanford in 1919
Maloney took over the track coach
ing job temporarily. He took a three
man team composed of Morris Kirk
sey. Dink Templeton, and Jess Wells,
back to the I.C. 4-A and won sixth
place with it. Kirksey, star sprinter,
pulled a muscle in the trials and
was forced to withdraw, so it was
really a two-man team which com
peted.
Stanford collected 15 points on a
first place, a second, and two thirds.
Wells beat Earl Thompson in the
low hurdles in 23 4-5, one fifth of
a second slower than world's record.
Thompson had just set the high

hurdles record at 14 2-5, which still
stands.
Rugby Team
Harry was appointed coach and
trainer of the American Olympic
Rugby team for the 1920 games at
Antwerp. The squad of 22 had 11
Stanford men on it and won the
Olympic championship under Ma
loney's leadership.
He was again appointed to that
position for the 1924 Olympic games,
but Stanford had been invited to
send a tennis team on a tour of Aus
tralia, and he decided to manage
and coach that team instead of going
to Paris, President Wilbur having
personally requested him to do so.
Australian Tour
That team, composed of Ted
Mertz, Dick Hinckley, Normal De
Back, and Harold Overvelt, travelled
21,000 miles in four months, the
longest trip ever made by a Stanford
team.
Offered a position as assistant
coach and trainer of the American
track team fo rthe 1928 Olympic
games at Amsterdam, Maloney was
unable to accept on account of a
teaching program in which he v/as
engaged during the summer quar
ter.
Twenty-two years a Stanford
coach with only a single break; thaf
is the record of Harry Maloney, di
rector of minor sports, and dean in
years of service of the University's
athletic staff.
Since he came here in 1908, Ma
loney has been active at one time
or another in almost every branch
of athletic activity which Stanford
has offered and has been instru
mental in the development of many
sports. Several members of the
Board of Athletic Control staff who
are at present holding forth on the
Farm owe their training to Maloney's
coaching during their undergrad
uate days.
Sport Training
Starting as an instructor in physi
cal education, Maloney quickly be
came connected with all sports in
the University. In 1911 the students
appointed him trainer for all ath
letic teams, which position he held
for several years until forced to give
it up because of his coaching work.
During this period, however, he es
tablished himself so firmly in popu
larity with the students that ever
since he has been the most gener
ally - liked man in the Stanford
coaching staff.
Soccer got.its initial impetus here
in 1910 from Maloney, who coached
it steadily until 1917, during which
time he never lost a game to Cali
fornia. After the World War, he re
sumed the coaching job and in 1920-
21-22 turned out elevens which
played a total of 42 straight games
without a defeat. Incidentally, Grad
uate Manager A 1 Masters of the
Board of Athletic Control was goal
keeper on the 1922 team.
War Veteran
With the outbreak of the Great
War, Maloney went to the officer's
training camp in San Francisco and
was commissioned a captain because
of his previous experienced gained
during the Boer War in South Af
rica. Later he was assigned to the
Stanford unit and then to Camp Fre
mont in the hills back of the cam
pus.
He went to France with the Bth
Division, and after the Armistice
was appointed head coach of the
American track team for the Inter-
Allied games. His team won the
meet by an overwhelming score. It
was at this time that Maloney came
in contact with Gene Tunney, for

Board of Athletic Control staff who
are at present holding forth on the
Farm owe their training to Maloney's
coaching during their undergrad
uate days.
Sport Training
Starting as an instructor in physi
cal education, Maloney quickly be
came connected with all sports in
the University. In 1911 the students
appointed him trainer for all ath
letic teams, which position he held
for several years until forced to give
it up because of his coaching work.
During this period, however, he es
tablished himself so firmly in popu
larity with the students that ever
since he has been the most gener
ally - liked man in the Stanford
coaching staff.
Soccer got.its initial impetus here
in 1910 from Maloney, who coached
it steadily until 1917, during which
time he never lost a game to Cali
fornia. After the World War, he re
sumed the coaching job and in 1920-
21-22 turned out elevens which
played a total of 42 straight games
without a defeat. Incidentally, Grad
uate Manager A 1 Masters of the
Board of Athletic Control was goal
keeper on the 1922 team.
War Veteran
With the outbreak of the Great
War, Maloney went to the officer's
training camp in San Francisco and
was commissioned a captain because
of his previous experienced gained
during the Boer War in South Af
rica. Later he was assigned to the
Stanford unit and then to Camp Fre
mont in the hills back of the cam
pus.
He went to France with the Bth
Division, and after the Armistice
was appointed head coach of the
American track team for the Inter-
Allied games. His team won the
meet by an overwhelming score. It
was at this time that Maloney came
in contact with Gene Tunney, for
mer heavyweight boxing champion,
who was in France with the A.E.F.
I.C. 4-A Team
On his return to Stanford in 1919
Maloney took over the track coach
ing job temporarily. He took a three
man team composed of Morris Kirk
sey. Dink Templeton, and Jess Wells,
back to the I.C. 4-A and won sixth
place with it. Kirksey, star sprinter,
pulled a muscle in the trials and
was forced to withdraw, so it was
really a two-man team which com
peted.
Stanford collected 15 points on a
first place, a second, and two thirds.
Wells beat Earl Thompson in the
low hurdles in 23 4-5, one fifth of
a second slower than world's record.
Thompson had just set the high

hurdles record at 14 2-5, which still
stands.
Rugby Team
Harry was appointed coach and
trainer of the American Olympic
Rugby team for the 1920 games at
Antwerp. The squad of 22 had 11
Stanford men on it and won the
Olympic championship under Ma
loney's leadership.
He was again appointed to that
position for the 1924 Olympic games,
but Stanford had been invited to
send a tennis team on a tour of Aus
tralia, and he decided to manage
and coach that team instead of going
to Paris, President Wilbur having
personally requested him to do so.
Australian Tour
That team, composed of Ted
Mertz, Dick Hinckley, Normal De
Back, and Harold Overvelt, travelled
21,000 miles in four months, the
longest trip ever made by a Stanford
team.
Offered a position as assistant
coach and trainer of the American
track team fo rthe 1928 Olympic
games at Amsterdam, Maloney was
unable to accept on account of a
teaching program in which he v/as
engaged during the summer quar
ter.
Twenty-two years a Stanford
coach with only a single break; thaf
is the record of Harry Maloney, di
rector of minor sports, and dean in
years of service of the University's
athletic staff.
Since he came here in 1908, Ma
loney has been active at one time
or another in almost every branch
of athletic activity which Stanford
has offered and has been instru
mental in the development of many
sports. Several members of the
Board of Athletic Control staff who
are at present holding forth on the
Farm owe their training to Maloney's
