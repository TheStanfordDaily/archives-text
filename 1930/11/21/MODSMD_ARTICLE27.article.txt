# "CUNNING" WAGONS PROVE VALUABLE TO STANFORD ATHLETES
## 
### 
Stanford's diminutive water wag
ons have, in spite of the many hu
morous remarks cast at them, a se
rious purpose which the majority
of people overlook entirely. They
are not only "cute" and "cunning,"
but sanitary and sensible, according
to Dr. Thomas A. Storey, men's med
ical adviser.
It was as part of a general sani
tation campaign that Dr. Storey con
ceived the water wagons three years
ago. His idea was executed by Ed
Loder, at that time B.A.C. engineer.
The purpose of their design was the
elimination of the community sucket
and sponge formerly used.
The towel rack on the water
wagon, which provides every player
with a fresh towel, was the idea of
Coach Tiny Thornhill. A towel
wagon for basketball games was also
installed.
However, the water wagons and
towel racks were only a part of Dr.
Storey's campaign. Coincident with
their construction was the installa
tion of drinking fountains and show
er heads on each of the football
practice fields. All these sanitary
measures were taken with the ob
ject of preventing distribution of the
respiratory diseases common to ath

letics, which so often handicap ;
team.
Contrary to many newspapei ac
counts, the wagons are not equip
