# Contrast Of Men Gives Warnermen Edge For Contest
## Lines Nearly On Par, But Backfield Margin Favors Cards 
### R.J. F 
If anybody cares, Stanford will
have, on paper, a decided edge over
the California Golden Bear in man
for-man play, when the two teams
clash tomorrow in what is laughing
ly called the Big Game.
The following comparison has been
made on the basis of the current
season, throwing out the perform
; ances of both teams against South
ern California, which may be con
sidered as immaterial, irrelevant and
downright unpleasant.
The Ends
Stanford has a decided advantage
at this post, with Phil Neill and Bill
Doub matched against Thornton,
Stone and Avery of the Bears. Neill,
if he plays his game, will be head
and shoulders above any of the other
wingmen. Doub, after that U.S.C.
manhandling, has improved 100 per
i cent, and is at least the equal of
Thornton, best of the Berkeley ilank
men. Stone is green and Avery
played his best football five years
ago with the Olympic Club.
The Tackles
If Dick Bogue turns in a dupli
cate of his game against Washing
ton, he will make the U.C. right
, side attack look very sour. Timmer
man of California was helpless
against the Cardinal reverses a year
ago, but he will probably play bet
ter ball than the injured Ray Tandy
or the inconsistent Chuck Ehrhorn.
Cahn, the other Bear tackle, is a fine
speaker, and that lets him out.
The Guards
Ted Beckett, the pugnacious Blue
and Gold guard, is about as good as
| any on the coast, and he will be
plenty conspicuous tomorrow. If Ray
Hulen starts for the Cards, he may
give Terrible Teddy some compe
tition, as Ray has come fast recently.
Bardin and Captain Tandy are about
a stand-off, except that Bill is much
better-looking.
The Centers
Look for Perry Taylor to outplay
Eichmeyer from here to thex - e, if he
can last the full game. The Bear
pivot man is an erratic passer,
among other things. Taylor is no
rose in that department, but he is
one whale of a defensive player. If
Beckett plays opposite him, which is
likely, Taylor may complete the job
St. Mary's started on Ted's bridge
work.
The Quarterbacks
For the sake of argument, Harry
Hillman will be designated as a
quarterback, although his duties do
not include signal calling. None of
the Bear field generals have been
outstanding this year. Kirwan will
get the call if he is in shape, which
is doubtful. Griffiths, really a half
back, may draw the job, with which
he is none too familiar. Potter, the
third choice, is the best safety man
of the lot, but he is small and inex
perienced. At all events, Hillman is
far above the rest of them as a ball
carrier, and as a defensive back,
whatever that proves.
The Halfbacks
Phil Moffatt against Hank Shal
daeh and Lee Valianos, and Guido
Caglieri versus Ray East. Moffatt
and Schaldach are the same type of
player—light, fast triple-theaters.
Schaldach is a better punter and a
better passer than Moffatt, but the
Cardinal can play safety, and the
Bear can't. Moffatt is a little harder
to catch in the open, too.
Caglieri and East are also similar
in style of play—big, speedy, hard
running backs. Caglieri has the edge
on experience.
The Fullbacks
Harlow Rothert cannot hit quite
as hard as Rusty Gill, nor is required
to back up a line, but he is a far
more valuable back, if only for his
i long high spirals that will put poor
, Cal in the hole. Gill, for all his line
smashing reputation, made less than
' nothing last year, and hasn't shone
particularly in that department this
year.

ton, he will make the U.C. right
, side attack look very sour. Timmer
man of California was helpless
against the Cardinal reverses a year
ago, but he will probably play bet
ter ball than the injured Ray Tandy
or the inconsistent Chuck Ehrhorn.
Cahn, the other Bear tackle, is a fine
speaker, and that lets him out.
The Guards
Ted Beckett, the pugnacious Blue
and Gold guard, is about as good as
| any on the coast, and he will be
plenty conspicuous tomorrow. If Ray
Hulen starts for the Cards, he may
give Terrible Teddy some compe
tition, as Ray has come fast recently.
Bardin and Captain Tandy are about
a stand-off, except that Bill is much
better-looking.
The Centers
Look for Perry Taylor to outplay
Eichmeyer from here to thex - e, if he
can last the full game. The Bear
pivot man is an erratic passer,
among other things. Taylor is no
rose in that department, but he is
one whale of a defensive player. If
Beckett plays opposite him, which is
likely, Taylor may complete the job
St. Mary's started on Ted's bridge
work.
The Quarterbacks
For the sake of argument, Harry
Hillman will be designated as a
quarterback, although his duties do
not include signal calling. None of
the Bear field generals have been
outstanding this year. Kirwan will
get the call if he is in shape, which
is doubtful. Griffiths, really a half
back, may draw the job, with which
he is none too familiar. Potter, the
third choice, is the best safety man
of the lot, but he is small and inex
perienced. At all events, Hillman is
far above the rest of them as a ball
carrier, and as a defensive back,
whatever that proves.
The Halfbacks
Phil Moffatt against Hank Shal
daeh and Lee Valianos, and Guido
Caglieri versus Ray East. Moffatt
and Schaldach are the same type of
player—light, fast triple-theaters.
Schaldach is a better punter and a
better passer than Moffatt, but the
Cardinal can play safety, and the
Bear can't. Moffatt is a little harder
to catch in the open, too.
Caglieri and East are also similar
in style of play—big, speedy, hard
running backs. Caglieri has the edge
on experience.
The Fullbacks
Harlow Rothert cannot hit quite
as hard as Rusty Gill, nor is required
to back up a line, but he is a far
more valuable back, if only for his
i long high spirals that will put poor
, Cal in the hole. Gill, for all his line
smashing reputation, made less than
' nothing last year, and hasn't shone
particularly in that department this
year.
If anybody cares, Stanford will
have, on paper, a decided edge over
the California Golden Bear in man
for-man play, when the two teams
clash tomorrow in what is laughing
ly called the Big Game.
The following comparison has been
made on the basis of the current
season, throwing out the perform
; ances of both teams against South
ern California, which may be con
sidered as immaterial, irrelevant and
downright unpleasant.
The Ends
Stanford has a decided advantage
at this post, with Phil Neill and Bill
Doub matched against Thornton,
Stone and Avery of the Bears. Neill,
if he plays his game, will be head
and shoulders above any of the other
wingmen. Doub, after that U.S.C.
manhandling, has improved 100 per
i cent, and is at least the equal of
Thornton, best of the Berkeley ilank
men. Stone is green and Avery
played his best football five years
ago with the Olympic Club.

For the sake of argument, Harry
Hillman will be designated as a
quarterback, although his duties do
not include signal calling. None of
the Bear field generals have been
outstanding this year. Kirwan will
get the call if he is in shape, which
is doubtful. Griffiths, really a half
back, may draw the job, with which
he is none too familiar. Potter, the
third choice, is the best safety man
of the lot, but he is small and inex
perienced. At all events, Hillman is
far above the rest of them as a ball
carrier, and as a defensive back,
whatever that proves.
The Halfbacks
Phil Moffatt against Hank Shal
daeh and Lee Valianos, and Guido
Caglieri versus Ray East. Moffatt
and Schaldach are the same type of
player—light, fast triple-theaters.
Schaldach is a better punter and a
better passer than Moffatt, but the
Cardinal can play safety, and the
Bear can't. Moffatt is a little harder
to catch in the open, too.
Caglieri and East are also similar
in style of play—big, speedy, hard
running backs. Caglieri has the edge
on experience.
The Fullbacks
Harlow Rothert cannot hit quite
as hard as Rusty Gill, nor is required
to back up a line, but he is a far
more valuable back, if only for his
i long high spirals that will put poor
, Cal in the hole. Gill, for all his line
smashing reputation, made less than
' nothing last year, and hasn't shone
particularly in that department this
year.
