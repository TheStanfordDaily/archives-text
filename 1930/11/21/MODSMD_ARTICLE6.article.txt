"Our men will be out there fighting for sixty minutes to
morrow," predicts Coach Nibs Price of the University of
California, "and win or lose, we can be proud of the showing
the men will make."

of the Redshirt horde. "However, if the men display the same
amount of improvement they showed in the Washington game,
we should come out on top. No game is ever won, though,
>until the final gun is fired."
