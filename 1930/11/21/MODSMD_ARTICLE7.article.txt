# Grays Provide Stanford Team With Material
## Many Unsung Heroes Go To Varsity Later 
### 
In the development oi' new stars,
the unsung outfit known as the
1 Stanford Grays is unsurpassed when
i it comes to furnishing Pop Warner
with material for his Varsity teams.
, Man after man spends a year in pre
liminary work on the so-called Goof
team under the direction of Murray
Cuddeback and Don Robesky, them
, selves stars on Cardinal varsities,
only to blossom out the next season
as stars of great magnitude.
A glance at the group of men who
' have spent time on the practice field
hidden behind Pop Warner's own
workground indicates the worth of
this year of practice work. On the
1930 squad are Don Colvin, Bill
Doub, Ned Clark, Ed Walker,
George Grey, Norm McLeod, Red
Hand, Rosy Dohrmann, Al Hunt,
! Akeley Quirk, "Fat" Oliver, Robert
Miliigan, Phil Baker, Spud Hardy,
Tom Lambert, Phil Wilson, Slip Gil
bert, Phil Neill, Bill Bardin, and
Phil Moffatt—all of whom having
i seen service with the Grays.
Twenty Promoted
Twenty of the 52 Cards with Gray
experience! Quite a handful of men
to migrate from unknowns to varsity
I in a year. Nor is this all., Many of
j the men now practically unknown
' will be heard from next season due
to the work of coaches Cuddeback
and Robesky. Ken Afflerbaugh,
Axel Nyland, John Hancock, Pete
Donlon, Irwin Tway, Thorny Rog
ers, Bill Corbus, Joe Ross, Bill
Bates, and John Twelvetrees have
served notice in their infrequent vis
its to the varsity field that they will
play in faster company in 1931.
What is this Gray team? It is
, composed of men who have not made
i the varsity or men who prefer not
j to take a year of competition, and
|it plays but a maximum of two
I games per season. For the past few
J years, the Cardinal Grays have come
j through with wins over the Califor
! nin Goofs in their "Big Game" of
the season.
Play for Fun
It is a group of men playing for
| fun—for experience—certainly not
; for glory. In the past, the team was
I not limited to the number of games
! permitted during a season, and in
i 1929 the Grays played five or six
games, taking them all by sizeable
; margins, and the authorities decided
| that this competition was almost as
!severe as regular intercollegiate
i play.
