# NEGRO SKETCH FEATURES 1930 GAME GAIETIES
## Program In General Not Equal To Standard Set Last Year REHEARSAL LACK SEEN 
### Staff Reviewer 
"Everybody's Going to Heaven,'
a negro spiritual sketch written and
staged by Harold Helvenston, was
the feature of the 1930 Big Game
Gaieties Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall. Frederick Slover as the
negro parson gave an excellent char
acterization which was enthusiasti
cally received. A dash of spirit and
spontaneity was added by Anne Mc-
Sweeney, whose personality con
tributed to the success of the act.
Lacking a polish which could have
been gained by rehearsal, the revue
as a whole was not up to the stand
ard set last year. Many of the
"blackout" numbers suffered from
a common fault: untrimmed dia
logue. In many cases the acts'
dragged to a weak climax or gag ■
lhat did not warrant the lengthy
dialogue leading up to it.
Thompson Sketches Good
Joe Thompson in his monologue
"Birds I Have Known" was genu
inely humorous. Nelson Carter's un
ceremonious entrances with "And
another aeroplane went foom over
the ol' channel," having no connec
tion with the sketch, were comical.
"Wear a Funny Hat," also by
Thompson, was one of the best of
ferings in the show. Harriet Geary's
dance deserves commendation.
"Old Fashioned Girl," with Harry
Logan and chorus, added to the pro
gram in typical revue style. The
pulchritudinous chorus ought to dis
prove once and for all the Stanford
Rough's complaint anent the Stan
ford women. This year's chorus did ,
not have to sing.
Gould, Speegle Stunt
"The Barnacle Broadcast," with
Burnell Gould and Paul Speegle,
was disappointing,- considering the
hit of the original radio act staged
in the 1928 Gaieties by the same
comedy team.
"Carl Candy," played by Jack
Dudfield, was very good in a skit
entitled "What Price Nibs?" This!
act, one of the few referring to the
Big Game, showed an extreme lack
of rehearsal, and a tendency by the
actors to chop into each other's lines.
Impersonations Given
Impersonations by Bob Perry and
Catherine Crary in "A Good-Will
Assembly" wei'e exceptionally good.
In "Low-Down on Shakespeare"
Ruth Beede and Burnell Gould did
well in a ludicrous situation. Terry
Brickley deserves praise for the ex
pert training of the chorus.
Many of the musical numbers
were excellent, especially Bob
Thornton's "That's the Way to Fall
in Love," and "You're My Happi
;iess" by Helen Sue Eyster, both
sung by Jean Jamison. Her voice,
although it does not carry well, has
a sweet tone quality but is best
suited to the "blues" type of song
in which she made a hit last year.
Speegle Amusing
Paul Speegle in the difficult po
sition of master of ceremonies kept
the audience amused between acts,
although here again the level of
humor showed room for improve- !
ment. Spectators in the left heel of
the horseshoe balcony, with possible
but not apparent humorous motive, !
showered coins (copper) on Speegle.
He took advantage of the situation
with extemporaneous wit that
proved his ability as a master of
ceremonies.
Morgan Charms
Lucille Morgan charmed her au- !
dience with songs in one of the most
entertaining acts. She sings well, has
a good speaking voice, and possesses
the faculty of sending her person
ality over the footlights.
All in all, the show was good but j
not in a class with previous Gaieties.

Speegle Amusing
Paul Speegle in the difficult po
sition of master of ceremonies kept
the audience amused between acts,
although here again the level of
humor showed room for improve- !
ment. Spectators in the left heel of
the horseshoe balcony, with possible
but not apparent humorous motive, !
showered coins (copper) on Speegle.
He took advantage of the situation
with extemporaneous wit that
proved his ability as a master of
ceremonies.
Morgan Charms
Lucille Morgan charmed her au- !
dience with songs in one of the most
entertaining acts. She sings well, has
a good speaking voice, and possesses
the faculty of sending her person
ality over the footlights.
All in all, the show was good but j
not in a class with previous Gaieties.
"Everybody's Going to Heaven,'
a negro spiritual sketch written and
staged by Harold Helvenston, was
the feature of the 1930 Big Game
Gaieties Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall. Frederick Slover as the
negro parson gave an excellent char
acterization which was enthusiasti
cally received. A dash of spirit and
spontaneity was added by Anne Mc-
Sweeney, whose personality con
tributed to the success of the act.
Lacking a polish which could have
been gained by rehearsal, the revue
as a whole was not up to the stand
ard set last year. Many of the
"blackout" numbers suffered from
a common fault: untrimmed dia
logue. In many cases the acts'
dragged to a weak climax or gag ■
lhat did not warrant the lengthy
dialogue leading up to it.
Thompson Sketches Good
Joe Thompson in his monologue
"Birds I Have Known" was genu
inely humorous. Nelson Carter's un
ceremonious entrances with "And
another aeroplane went foom over
the ol' channel," having no connec
tion with the sketch, were comical.
"Wear a Funny Hat," also by
Thompson, was one of the best of
ferings in the show. Harriet Geary's
dance deserves commendation.
"Old Fashioned Girl," with Harry
Logan and chorus, added to the pro
gram in typical revue style. The
pulchritudinous chorus ought to dis
prove once and for all the Stanford
Rough's complaint anent the Stan
ford women. This year's chorus did ,
not have to sing.
Gould, Speegle Stunt
"The Barnacle Broadcast," with
Burnell Gould and Paul Speegle,
was disappointing,- considering the
hit of the original radio act staged
in the 1928 Gaieties by the same
comedy team.
"Carl Candy," played by Jack
Dudfield, was very good in a skit
entitled "What Price Nibs?" This!
act, one of the few referring to the
Big Game, showed an extreme lack
of rehearsal, and a tendency by the
actors to chop into each other's lines.
Impersonations Given
Impersonations by Bob Perry and
Catherine Crary in "A Good-Will
Assembly" wei'e exceptionally good.
In "Low-Down on Shakespeare"
Ruth Beede and Burnell Gould did
well in a ludicrous situation. Terry
Brickley deserves praise for the ex
pert training of the chorus.
Many of the musical numbers
were excellent, especially Bob
Thornton's "That's the Way to Fall
in Love," and "You're My Happi
;iess" by Helen Sue Eyster, both
sung by Jean Jamison. Her voice,
although it does not carry well, has
a sweet tone quality but is best
suited to the "blues" type of song
in which she made a hit last year.
