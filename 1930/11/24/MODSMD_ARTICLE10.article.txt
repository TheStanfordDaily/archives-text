# QUIET FOLLOWS SOUTHERN GALE
## Wind Kills Six, Causes Huge Property Damage 
### 
i LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23. (TP) —A
i warm sun beamed down over south
! era California today, contrast to the
| dust-laden, destructive gale of yes
terday which sent six persons to
j morgues, ruined thousands of dol
l lars worth of citrus fruit, and
| wrought unestimated damage to
| property in four counties. The wind
spent itself by early evening, and
; the night was quiet.
State and county officials were
j making a survey of the damage to
| day, but said their reports would not
j be finished until tomorrow at least.
The outlying districts, particularly
the citrus lands, suffered probably
I the worst as far as monetary dam
; age was concerned.
Citrus Crop Suffers
Nearly mature oranges, lemons,
i and avocadoes, torn from the trees
I by a gale which at times reached
lan 85-milc velocity, covered the
j ground. Hundreds of trees, up
i rooted by the onslaught of the wind,
i lay dying in the sun. Ranchers be
| gan today to retrieve as much of
! the fruit as possible, although they
i admitted the vast majority of their
! oranges and lemons were ruined.
In the cities billboards, trees,
' signs, awnings, and structures built
1 of flimsy material, lay where they
: had fallen, while along the beaches
1 small craft were strewn, torn from
their moorings and hurled onto the
! dry sand, their backs broken.
The most spectacular damage in
i and immediately adjacent to Los
' Angeles was the complete demolition
of the old Mack Sennett motion pic
j ture studio, one of the first in south-
I cm California.
• The United States Weather Bu
reau forecast for the next 24 hours
called for a fairly stiff breeze, but
said there would be no damage cx
! cept possibly in exposed sections.
