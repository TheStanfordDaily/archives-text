# GREEN GRIDMEN HALT TRIP FOR BRIEF WORKOUT
## Dartmouth Eleven Drills On Passing At Stop On Way West 
### Phil Sherman 
NORTH PLATTE. Neb., Nov. 23.
—(Exclusive) —The Dartmouth spe
cial train, bearing the Big Green
football team, stopped at this city
for a short workout today which
consisted of playing a few games of
touch football on the station plat
form.
Yesterday the team had its only
uniformed practice session of the
trip in Oak Park, Illinois, where a
long passing drill was held which
was none too impressive. Dartmouth
will rely on two veteran backfield
men, Shep Wolff and "Wild Bill"
McCall for the aerial attack which
the coaches feel is Dartmouth's best
offense.
No Overconfidcnec
There is no feeling of cverconfi
dence among the team members,
and they feel that Dartmouth will
be decidedly the underdog in the
Stanford game. In past years Dart
mouth has been known as a pass
ing team, but this season has shown
the team employing this attack in
only one game, which was pulled
out of the fire by a last-minute
rally.
Dartmouth will be able to send
its full strength against Stanford,
for the only varsity men on the in
jured list have been out for so many
weeks that the team has managed
to get along without them.
Reserve Power Lacking
The Green this year is lacking in
reserve power, and several of the
linemen, notably Captain Harold
Andres, Paul Crehan, and Gay
Bromberg, have played through the
major part of the last three games
without substitutes, a feat which
they cannot hope to do against
Stanford.
This lack of reserve material at
Dartmouth is expected to take its
toll in the game.
