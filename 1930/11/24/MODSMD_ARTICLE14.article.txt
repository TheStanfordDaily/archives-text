# BILLINGS-MOONEY CASE INVESTIGATED BY SUPREME COURT
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 23. (A>)—
In an effort to ascertain the truth of
circumstances linked with the San
Francisco Preparedness Day parade
bombing on July 22, 1916, and con
viction of Warren K. Billings as one
responsible for the fatal blast, the
State Supreme Court dropped its
legal identity for nearly a month.
The seven justices became inves
tigators. They went into Folsom
prison—a move unprecedented in
the history of American jurispru
dence — questioned the prisoner
there; and they questioned and
cross-questioned men and women—
heard charges and counter-charges
—wrangled as attorneys with de
fenders and prosecutors, then finally
resumed their black robes of dignity,
again the supreme court, to render
the decision.
All this the supreme court did
after it. once ruled 6 to 1 that the
evidence at hand did not warrant
granting Billings a pardon recom
mendation. The court so informed
Governor Young in a report ren
dered last July 4.
