Students who have spent time at

living groups to explain the work
of the rest homes, according to Mrs.
Edwin J. Thomas of the Stanford
Mothers Club, which is sponsoring
the work of the rest homes.
"Students lack information about
the rest homes, and we are taking
steps to help them learn about the
homes which exist for their own
convenience as a stopping place be-

Thomas declared.
Arrangements as to time and
place of the talks, which have not
