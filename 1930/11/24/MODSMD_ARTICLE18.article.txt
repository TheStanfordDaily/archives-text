# DRIVE GOES ON FOR RED CROSS
## Only $350 Collected In Slow Campaign 
### 
In an effort to raise more money
for the general Red Cross fund, the
Red Cross drive conducted under
the auspices of the A.S.S.U. will
continue this week.
According to Bob Perry, chairman
of the campaign, the drive has not
suceeded as well this year as it did
at the same time last year. Much
effort will be necessary in the re
maining three days, he says, in order
to make the drive reach the stand
ard set by previous campaigns. Up
to the present time only about $350
has been collected from both men
and women.
Women Contribute
Women have made the contribu
tion of $1 which is asked, more
readily than men, reports Eliza
beth McCuNough, women's chairman
of the drive. They have already
turned in $176. Three houses, Pi
Beta Phi, Delta Gamma, and Alpha
Omicron Pi, have contributed 100
per cent.
Men's living groups are urged to
be more liberal with their contri
butions. At present, there arc sev
eral houses and clubs that have
donated nothing at all to the fund.
Five Leading Groups
The five men's living groups
whose contributions head the list are
as follows: Theta Delta Chi, $27;
Alpha Kappa Lambda, $24; Phi
Delta Theta, $21; Theta Xi, $20; El
Cuadro, $15.
Members of the men's general
committee may turn in any money
collected to Bob Perry at the
A.S.S.U. office between 1 and 2
o'clock every afternoon.
