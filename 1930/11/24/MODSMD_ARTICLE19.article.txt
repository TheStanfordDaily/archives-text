# Cardinal Varsity Lambastes Bear In Smashing Win
## Raging California Men Hold Redshirts To Six-Point Lead At Half time; Barrage of Passes Paves Way For Later Attack SCORE OF 41 TO 0 SETS BIG GAME RECORD 
### BY LEN KULLMANN 
Stanford 41, California 0.
Bloody, beaten, crushed, torn and bewildered, an exhausted California
Bear dragged himself wearily from the turf of the California Stadium
Saturday leaving a triumphant Redshirt varsity in the possession of the
most complete triumph ever achieved in the annals of Bis Games.
Held to a lone touchdown during the course of the first 30 minutes of
play by a raging Blue and Gold eleven, the Cardinals threw pass after
pass in preparation for the running attack which was to follow. It was a

barrage of footballs which rained
upon the Bears, a storm which de
moralized the defenses for the re
verses and bucks to come.
Break Scoring Record
Opening the second half with Ro
thert, Hillman, Caddel, arid M-' T att,
the Cards scored 22 points in 15
minutes of furipus football which
swept the Blue and Gold eleven be
fore it. In the final period, the Red
shirt warriors added 13 points to
amass a total of 41 digits and wipe
the .'5B-0 high score record set by
California in 1920 from the records.
Superior generalship, greater man
power, a smoother offense, and an
all-round superiority in all phases of
the game gave the Cardinals their
expected triumph. With the excep
tion of Beckett at guard, easily the
outstanding man on the field, the
Stanford forward wall outplayed the
Beaz-s. In the backfield, the Cardinal
superiority was more marked with
Moffatt, Rothert, Caddel, Hillman,
Simkins, Clark, and Caglieri all
working well.
Cards Get Early Lead
Scoring in four minutes, the War
nermen went into an early lead.
After Moffatt had returned a punt
to California's 36-yard line, Clark's
run had been recalled, and the
Cards penalized 15 yards for holding,
a pass from Moffatt to Ncill put the
oval 26 yards out. Hillman 4, Clark
5, Moffatt 15 yards to the 5-yard
stripe, and Hillman over in three
tries produced the first touchdown.
Held even for that half, the War
nermen ran riot for the remainder
of the game. From 54 yards dut,
they marched to a touchdown, Ro
thert going over for the precious
yard on the final try. Following an
exchange of punts, Rothert's 30-yard
pass to Moffatt followed by the lat
ter's 27-yard ramble ran the score
to 19-0.
Mnffatt Starts March
California kicked off. and Moffntt
started an advance culminating in
a touchdown with his 23-yard re
turn. With Rothert motoring the Big
Red machine for four successive first
downs, another score was added to
the total. Three plays more, and
the Cards had a safety' and two
points in additiop.
Grey kicked off, with East coming
back to the 17-yard line. Kirw.m
I lost 10 yards on an attempted pass.
' and half the Stanford forwards
broke through to smother Garrity's
kick which rolled out of bounds
from the end zone, making an auto
matic safety.
Many Substitutions
Final points were produced in the
fourth quarter after numerous sub
stitutions. Rintala's pass to Rothert
climaxed a 38-yard march*, whi! ■
Simkins' passes, first to Lambert for
30, and then to Laird for 35 yards,
brought another six points.
Buried beneath the avalanche of
scoring plays, California fought back
With everything the Bears had. But
fight alore did not succeed in keep
ing down the margin of victory, al
though it won the admiration of the
crowd for the California varsity.
