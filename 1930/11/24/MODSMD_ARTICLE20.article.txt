# Serpentine, Axe With 'Poor Cal' Make Card Day
## Stanfordites Sympathize With Beaten Bears 
### Eleanor Boyd 
| Saturday was Stanford's day.
Stanford had been sure it would be,
so sure that the roar of "Poor Cal"
from the rooting section sounded
sympathetic, and the serpentine af
ter the game was only half-hearted,
as if it were unnecessary to rub in
such a victory.
California was hopeful at the be
ginning of the game. Their team
was greeted with great enthusiasm,
but later on there was nothing for
them to be enthusiastic about. They
had to sit and listen to Stanford's
victorious cheers, and could only re
taliate by snatching red rooters' caps
as the mob filed gut of the stadium.
Stunts At Half
The half brought stunts. Cali
fornia welcomed Stanford and then
showed pictures which were far
from being carried out, in practice—
the Bear making a pleasant meal of
the Stanford Indian.
This was the first Big Game since
the homecoming of the axe, and
California was not allowed to forget
it. ' Who's got the Axe?" roared the
rooting section; Stanford co-eds
brandished wooden axes of Cardinal
red; the old axe yell resounded with
an added meaning, and the stunts
told again the old and welt-known
story of the man, the camera, and
the axe.
Drum Makes Debut
Perhaps to take the place of its
, glorious predecessor, the axe, the
j Stanford drum made its debut, un
der the protection of a guard of
Scalpers. Great precautions were
taken against its loss, for it was
brought up to Berkeley secretly the
night before, taken to the field in a
guarded truck, and rushed away
before the game was over.
Scalpers escorted it off the field,
their pace dignified as long as they
. were in the stadium. They were met
, at the exit by a crowd of police
men, but the U.C. rooters were
either too lazy or too depressed to
; be ihere.
Heroes Of Day
The day was not without its
heroes. The Stanford section rose
when Moffatt and Rothert came off
the field, but Beckett received an
even greater ovation. Every Blue
and Gold rooter rose and cheered
to honor this plucky player, and
Stanford cheered him too.
San Francisco was the rule after
the game. Every hotel was packed
with revellers seeking celebration or
forgotfulness, and many found both.

their pace dignified as long as they
. were in the stadium. They were met
, at the exit by a crowd of police
men, but the U.C. rooters were
either too lazy or too depressed to
; be ihere.
Heroes Of Day
The day was not without its
heroes. The Stanford section rose
when Moffatt and Rothert came off
the field, but Beckett received an
even greater ovation. Every Blue
and Gold rooter rose and cheered
to honor this plucky player, and
Stanford cheered him too.
San Francisco was the rule after
the game. Every hotel was packed
with revellers seeking celebration or
forgotfulness, and many found both.
| Saturday was Stanford's day.
Stanford had been sure it would be,
so sure that the roar of "Poor Cal"
from the rooting section sounded
sympathetic, and the serpentine af
ter the game was only half-hearted,
as if it were unnecessary to rub in
such a victory.
California was hopeful at the be
ginning of the game. Their team
was greeted with great enthusiasm,
but later on there was nothing for
them to be enthusiastic about. They
had to sit and listen to Stanford's
victorious cheers, and could only re
taliate by snatching red rooters' caps
as the mob filed gut of the stadium.
Stunts At Half
The half brought stunts. Cali
fornia welcomed Stanford and then
showed pictures which were far
from being carried out, in practice—
the Bear making a pleasant meal of
the Stanford Indian.
This was the first Big Game since
the homecoming of the axe, and
California was not allowed to forget
it. ' Who's got the Axe?" roared the
rooting section; Stanford co-eds
brandished wooden axes of Cardinal
red; the old axe yell resounded with
an added meaning, and the stunts
told again the old and welt-known
story of the man, the camera, and
the axe.
Drum Makes Debut
Perhaps to take the place of its
, glorious predecessor, the axe, the
j Stanford drum made its debut, un
der the protection of a guard of
Scalpers. Great precautions were
taken against its loss, for it was
brought up to Berkeley secretly the
night before, taken to the field in a
guarded truck, and rushed away
before the game was over.
Scalpers escorted it off the field,
their pace dignified as long as they
. were in the stadium. They were met
, at the exit by a crowd of police
men, but the U.C. rooters were

; be ihere.
