# 'POP' WARNER ALSO POET WARNER; IS REVEALED AS AUTHOR OF HYMN
## 
### SHERIDAN HEGLAND 
After the Stanford Indian's 41 to 0
scalping of the California Bear, and
after Wallace Denny, Cardinal train
er, had vigorously r.ubbed down his
players and carefully examined
thom for injuries, he laughingly re
vealed that "Pop" Warner in more
youthful years had entertained as
pirations as a poetâ€”at least to the
extent of writing "Old Carlisle"
while a coach at that school.
And Carlisle, having no school
hymn, adopted the young grid men
tor's poem as its official hymn. The
tune is from "Maryland, Our Mary
land," Denny said.
The hvmn follows:

Old Carlisle
Nestling 'neath the mountains blue
Old Carlisle, our fair Carlisle!
We'll ne'er forget our debt to you
Old Carlisle, our dear Carlisle!
While the "years roll Swiftly by,
In our hearts thou art ever nigh.
To honor thee we'll ever try,
Old Carlisle, our dear Carlisle!
All your precepts we hold dear,
Old Carlisle, our dear Carlisle!
The world we'll face without a fear,
Old Carlisle, our dear Carlisle!
Rememb'ring thee we'll never fail
We'll weather every stormy gale,
As o'er life's troubled sea we sail,
Old Carlisle, our dear Carlisle.
