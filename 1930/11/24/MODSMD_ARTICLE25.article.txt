# WILL STANFORD TRIUMPH?
## 
### 
The California debate, which is perhaps the outstanding event of
the forensic season, will take place tonight in the Asseniblv Mali
with Stanford upholding the affirmative of the proposition, "Re
solved, that this house approves of the extra-legal methods em
ployed by the city of Chicago to combat crime."
Tonight's encounter should prove particularly interesting in that
the Knglish practice of sparring with wit and satire will be mixed
with the traditional American clash of logic. The debaters hope to
get away from the stiff, formal style of this country: and yet not
embrace the ().\ford practice, which has been criticized as insincere.
from the topic it is likely that Citizen Caponc of Chicago, and
his playmates, will be prominently mentioned in the discussion. The
debate has special application to California since Caponc has at
tempted to coerce the grape growers of this state.
The question now is. can Stanford triumph in this intellectual
field as it did on the gridiron Saturday.
