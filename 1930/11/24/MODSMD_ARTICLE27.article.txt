# THE
						FEMININE FOIBLES

### 
The eternal feminine has risen to the fore once more to interest
a gaping campus. The latest news to emanate from the camps of
the hive Hundred are lock-out statistics showing Stanford women
"boonj" more during examination week than they do during the
preceding week.
It does seem interesting. It almost appears that Stanford women
become book worms in the week before quizzes. I'ossiblv there will
be more scholastic honors amoiig the women as the result of this
intensive endeavor.
Not content, however, to rest on their laurels, the women have
revealed tlit' true cause: Members of the I'ive Hundred receive
more invitations during examination week than they do the pre
ceding week.
