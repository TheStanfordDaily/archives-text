# A 						FAIR DEAL ALL AROUND

For their failure to muzzle the editor of the Daily Californian,
student newspaper, the vice-president of the I'niversity of Southern ;
California assailed heads of the I'niversity of California recently.
The student editor had made charges. Those charges are ig- !
nored. Instead, a university vice-president complains because an
undergraduate himself first complained —with charges that univer
sity football is rotten.
\\ hen the ( arnegie I'oundation report on proselvting of ath
letes was made public last year, the vice-president's resentment did
not make news. Probably he did not mind at all that report, but it
does not hurt if charges are brought home.
\t ()regon we cannot know the truth of those charges, but
neither can we sympathize with the reasoning which denies even a
hearing to the questions asked by the Californian's editor.
That those questions should be asked immediately after Cali
fornia was so overwhelmingly defeated in a football game we con
sider unfortunate because that defeat may preclude calm judgment.
Hut to the right of the Daily Calif ornian to question football
organization in other schools, in every coast conference school, in
()regon itself, we can see no objection. For Oregon, as jet object of
no serious challenges, the problem is that right of students to in
vestigate student problems,—Oregon I'.incraUl.
