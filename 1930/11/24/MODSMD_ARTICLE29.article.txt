THE LAST PARADISE. By Hick
man Powell. Jonathan Cape &.
Harrison Smith. 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
In Bali, an island south of Borneo
and west of Java, did Hickman
Powell, ex-newspaper writer, find
the land of eternal bliss which he
describes in his book, "The Last
Paradise."
Each day in Bali, according to
Powell, is flavored with a million
yesterday. I *. Its residents have spent
a thousand years is not getting any
place, and therefore are completely
happy, living a life which does not
know such modern refinements of
civilization as poison liquor and the
morning after the Big Game.
Powell describes his visit to the
' island in an undistinguished style.
Much more vivid are a dozen or
more photographs reproduced at the
i back of the book.
"The Last Paradise" belongs to
1 that great middle class of travel-
I books which are distinguishable
I neither by a great beauty nor a
! great dullness. —J. McG.
i
| BIG BOY—At the Varsity Theatre.
A 1 Jolson, horse-hokum, and a
J fixed race; tripe with tomato sauce,
! A 1 being the sauce.
| Here, praise Allah, is a Jolson
I cinema convenience that doesn't
j take itself seriously.

"Big Boy" pretends to nothing
more than re-exploitation of the
popular black-face.
This picture is by far the best of
the Jolson screen series. Maybe that
isn't saying much. But "Big Boy" is
above average (movie average) as
entertainment. —B. P.
RENEGADES—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
"Renegades" has for a background
the desert wastes of Morocco, and
particulary Fort Aamala, a strong
hold of the French Legion. Unfor
tunately, "Renegades" reminds one
almost too consciously of "Beau
Geste," but, of course, the plot and
characters afford variety.
Warner Baxter, as the ringleader
of the renegades, plays a colorful,
daredevil part, not without its ro
mantic moments. Myrna Loy is al
ways the sensuous, scheming wo
man, but in "Renegades" she reach
es a height of deception and false
ness which is scarcely capable of
belief. Wallace Beery can always be
counted on for a well-done comedy
element.
For those who enjoy a really dra
matic ending instead of the usual
embrace, "Renegades" is just the
picture. It has plenty of action, bits
of splendid photography, and a
three-cornered plot that has been
twisted into a new human tangle.

ways the sensuous, scheming wo
man, but in "Renegades" she reach
es a height of deception and false
ness which is scarcely capable of
belief. Wallace Beery can always be
counted on for a well-done comedy
element.
For those who enjoy a really dra
matic ending instead of the usual
embrace, "Renegades" is just the
picture. It has plenty of action, bits
of splendid photography, and a
three-cornered plot that has been
twisted into a new human tangle.

THE LAST PARADISE. By Hick
man Powell. Jonathan Cape &.
Harrison Smith. 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
In Bali, an island south of Borneo
and west of Java, did Hickman
Powell, ex-newspaper writer, find
the land of eternal bliss which he
describes in his book, "The Last
Paradise."
Each day in Bali, according to
Powell, is flavored with a million
yesterday. I *. Its residents have spent
a thousand years is not getting any
place, and therefore are completely
happy, living a life which does not
know such modern refinements of
civilization as poison liquor and the
morning after the Big Game.
Powell describes his visit to the
' island in an undistinguished style.
Much more vivid are a dozen or
more photographs reproduced at the
i back of the book.
"The Last Paradise" belongs to
1 that great middle class of travel-
I books which are distinguishable
I neither by a great beauty nor a
! great dullness. —J. McG.

| BIG BOY—At the Varsity Theatre.
A 1 Jolson, horse-hokum, and a
J fixed race; tripe with tomato sauce,
! A 1 being the sauce.
| Here, praise Allah, is a Jolson
I cinema convenience that doesn't
j take itself seriously.

"Big Boy" pretends to nothing
more than re-exploitation of the
popular black-face.
This picture is by far the best of
the Jolson screen series. Maybe that
isn't saying much. But "Big Boy" is
above average (movie average) as
entertainment. —B. P.
RENEGADES—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
"Renegades" has for a background
the desert wastes of Morocco, and
particulary Fort Aamala, a strong
hold of the French Legion. Unfor
tunately, "Renegades" reminds one
almost too consciously of "Beau
Geste," but, of course, the plot and
characters afford variety.
Warner Baxter, as the ringleader
of the renegades, plays a colorful,
daredevil part, not without its ro
mantic moments. Myrna Loy is al
ways the sensuous, scheming wo
man, but in "Renegades" she reach
es a height of deception and false
ness which is scarcely capable of
belief. Wallace Beery can always be
