# Cabbages and Things

### 
Back to a quiet three days, after
a quiet week-end. Somehow, vic
tory didn't seem to go to our heads,
as it usually does. Nine-tenths of the
noise and celebration Saturday night
was Californian. Guess it was a case
of drowning sorrows. Stanford's
night should come next Saturday.
With the varsity laid away in cotton
wool, waiting for next week, what
incentive was there to whoop it up,
particularly?
Except that it was one Hades
of a good game, and that they
broke the Big Game scoring
record, and that it seems to us
that everything Cardinal out
shone itself—even the hand
gleamed, along with its custom
ary twittering.
The war drum is impressive look
ing—and considerably harder to
steal than the axe ever was. Cali
fornia co-eds took it upon them
selves to capture something red and
white, and took to their heels after
Stanford rooters' caps, in droves.
We have it on good authority
that U.C. students believe our
band to consist entirely of left
handed clarinet players, after
the war chant had been at-

tempted twice. Maybe it's just
because we sit among the root
ers—but the chant is awfully
suggestive of "Pale Moon" at an
afternoon tea ....
By this time, we hope the long
suffering Gaieties chorus has had its
eight hours of sleep, and worn off
most of its stiff joints. One Palo Alto
\ High student, who got into the audi
torium Friday night, by mistake,
was fearfully disgusted to find that
the thing amounted only to an ama
teurish lesson in the Art of Pro
-1 faitity. And he'd already learned
that, last year.
With football season closing
soon, the Five Hundred are get
ting athletic-minded on their
own side of the campus. The
new gymnasium is growing
more impressive looking every
day.
Meanwhile, the gold-diggingest
minds among them are planning a
i Junior Carnival, early in December.
The announcement of this event in
: eludes throwing balls at electric
lights, darts at balloons, arrows at a
target, hoops over prizes, basketballs
over backstops — and doubtless,
i drawing wool over patrons' eyes.
