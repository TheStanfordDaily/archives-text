According to the U.C.L.A. Bruin,
dirty cords are no longer in fashion
at that institution. This might have
been expected where 4,000 co-eds
attempt to change a co-educational
college into' a university for co-eds.
If the men don't band to
gether in one last stand against
Sorority Row, they soon will be
wearing "Boudoir Pink" cords
with lace ruffles at the cuffs.
And although the women may
i have the whip-hand in some mat
ters, when it comes to dates, one
never saw a more independent group
of men those Uclanders.
Everybody is always giving ad
vice to* frosh—from barbers to col
lege presidents. Brigham Young
University advises frosh to leave
their conceit at home. Illinois told
freshmen to forget their high-school
necking habits.
One might add to this valuable
advice, the warning that first-year
men should not accept as the gospel
truth all that they read in text
books. Most freshmen have the
queer notion that once an idea is in
print, it automatically becomes one
of the world's eternal truths.
Sophomores have a tendency, it is
said, to go to the opposite extreme
and believe nothing. Juniors adopt
a middle ground while seniors don't
give a whoop one way or the other.
California co-eds have a new
sport. It consists of racing pet
turtles. On other campi, where
women are a minority, they de
rive more pleasure out of racing
contending men—which is a
FASTER pursuit to say the least.
Modern education surely is using
business psychology. At the Uni
versity of Michigan students must
show identification cards before be
ing admitted to -each class of the
day.
Perhaps if students had to make
reservations in advance to get into
classes; if they were threatened if
they scalped their tickets to these
classes; and had to stand in line for
twenty minutes to enter a lecture
hall— it would create such a desire
to attend recitation hours that men
in "red hats" would have to stand
guard to prevent riots in the mad
rush to daily classes.
A dispatch from flic Univer
sity of Washington states that
10 co-eds will test beards in con
test. What is the proper test for
a heard? Warmth to (Ik* chest?
Cushioning value for tired co-

Cds' curly heads? Color harmony
or what not?
At the University of Pennsylvania
women are not allowed to work on
the newspaper. At the University
of Oregon a campus-produced
movie, "The Ed's Co-Ed," will be
shown soon.
Now you can see why Pennsyl
vania has taken such drastic action.
It does not seem fair to deny the
co-ed the great values lhat are
derived from working on a cam
pus daily; yet on the other hand it
doesn't seem just to have a news
paper office where men must often
talk in whispers.
