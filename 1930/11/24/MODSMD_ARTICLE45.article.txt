## WHAT A GAME! WHAT A SPECTACLE! 
### 
On Saturday, November 29, the
anford rooting section will have
i last opportunity to get behind
Skyrocket for Captain Ray Tandy,
ever a gridiron warrior deserved
e biggest Skyrocket of the season,
indy is that warrior. Those who
w him play in 1929 know what a
an he was—this year he was
reed to take himself out of the
g Game after ten minutes of play.
the game or out, Captain Ray is
i inspiration for the Cardinals.
Shades of 1!)25 and Tricky Dick
viand! On the first Stanford of
nsivc play of the game Saturday—
shift to the rif*lit, a reverse to the
fl. and Bill Clark is oIT. He stiff
ins two lacklers, out-speeds East
id Kirwan to make the end zone,
yards away, only to be called
ick. And how the Californians
leered Herb Dana as he penalized
e Cards 15 long yards for holding!
The Bears had two football players
i the field in the persons of Ted
-*ckett and Russ Avery. Stanford
verses aimed at Avery's flank
jre singularly unproductive of
irdage. While Ted Beckett . . .
it you saw the game too. Griffiths,
ist, Kirwan, and Garrity did noble
>rk for the Blue and Gold in the
ickfield, but could not compare
ith their opponents.
Warner certainiy opened up with
i aerial game in the first half,
bile the only apparent effect of
e tosses in the opening periods
;ts to shade the California hacks
oni the sun, the success of the
nning plays in the final half was
large measure due to the spread
tense of the bears to protect
ainst forward passes.
After the firsi four minutes of the
•citing quarter when it appeared
at the Bears were being fed to
e wolves, the half was more com
rting to California than to Stan
td. Griffiths and Garrity tore the
•dshirt forward wall to shreds, and
irrity's quick kick which would
ive found Moffatt napping went
it of bounds before it traveled 15
ircLs. Had the play worked, Cali
rnia might have scored in the sec
id quarter.
Harry Hillman, hiding behind his
Mow mask, turned in as sweet a
me at quarter as one could hope
r. Faking, plunging, blocking, and
ckling, liillman's number 2 grew
lite familiar to the Spanile chil
lite familiar to the Campanile
ildrcn before he left the game. It
is lie who pulled Griffiths down
•in behind after a long gallop, and
was he who punched over the first
uchdown.
Proving that a prophet is not
ihout honor et cetera—we never
•preciated how good Don Lieben
irfer's public address announce
were until we heard the
ilifornia speakers. Perhaps the an
iuncer was too interested in the
me, but at any rate he fell far
hind the standard set in the
anford Stadium by our own sil
r-throated product.
Phil Neill, another chap who re
oved himself from the game,
owed as the best wingman on the
Id while he was in the melee. Don
»hin who replaced peerless Phil,
stifled all the compliments paid
in at the start of the season. LTn
stakahle \\Sth his black thatch in
e middle of every play, Colvin
iide the California boys wonder
lether they preferred blonds or
unettcs.
Impressions before the game: Ah
