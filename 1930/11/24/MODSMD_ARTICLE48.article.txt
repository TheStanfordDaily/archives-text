# Intramural Elevens In Last Round Of Series
## TEAMS COME TO FRONT AS SEASON APPROACHES END Sigma Nu Apparent Winner In League Three; Theta Chi Out In Lead 
### 
Championships in Leagues I and
IV were virtually clinched and that
of League 111 almost put on ice as
a result of fourth-round games in
the intramural touch football tour
nament last week. In the other two
leagues, II and V, the duel for pre
mier honors will not be completed
until fifth and final games this week
are won or lost.
Theta Chi has rolled up a decisive
lead in League I. They have played
and won four games, scoring vic
tories over the second- and third
place teams, Phi Kappa Sigma and
Delta Upsilon, and running up a
total of 78 points while holding
their opponents scoreless.
Sigma Chi Leads
Sigma Chi players have almost
sewed up first place in League IV,
having beaten every team in their
division except Sequoia 11, whom
they meet this week. Two of their
wins were by default, but in the
two games they have played they
have displayed the most potent
passing attack in the tournament to
roll up 59 points. No one has scored
on them.
Sigma Nu is the undisputed pos
sessor of first place in League 111 by
virtue of four victories in as many
games. El Toro, which shared the
lead after the third round, fell a
victim to Delta Chi 13-0 last week.
Delta Tau Delta and Phi Gamma
Delta are way out in front of League
ll's teams with their four victories.
One of them will lose unde
feated status today when they clash
on field 4 at 3 o'clock.
Race In League V
There is a wide open race for
premier honors in League V among
the A.K.L.'s, the Phi Delts, and the
Phi Sigs. Each of them has a per
centage of 1.000. One set of cham
pionship hopes is to be blasted to
morrow when the A.K.L.'s clash
with the Phi Delts.
