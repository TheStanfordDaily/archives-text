LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23. (P.1.P.)
—Gentlemen on the University of
California at Los Angeles campus
are in a decided minority, if Anita
Loos' definition is to be taken as a
criterion. In balloting for the most
popular co-ed, students gave a ma
jority of 600 votes to Miss Ruth
Irwin, a dark, winsome miss.
Miss Irwin is now "Colonel Irwin"
as a result. They don't make their
most popular girls queens of this
and that at U.C.L.A. —they make
them honorary colonels in the Re
serve Officers Training Corps
They even gave Miss Irw.n a
sword to show she has the authority
as well as the title.
