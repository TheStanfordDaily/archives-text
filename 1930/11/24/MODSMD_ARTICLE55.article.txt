i Football, because it is a rousing
, and vigorous game, a rough, bruising
' sport for real men, with plenty of
direct physical contact as well as
: strategy and tactics, is the real war
' game of today, stirring the blood of
both players and spectators and
i awaking the fundamental "battle
j spirit" in both old and young. li'
• only the nations would play it and
substitute an annual international
contest for their wars!
Like an army, a football team
must have a commander, a plan ol
attack and 'defense, and men to
play it who can concentrate on their
1 objective. The soldiers of old find

; their counterpart in the gridiron
; warriors of today and even in looks
1' the modern football player, with the
; sunlight glinting on his helmet and
• his body armor of padding and
: leather, is a real Knight, surrounded
t by an aura of glamor just as were
? his predecessors four or five cen
[' turies ago.
1 | Football was played in Sparta
1 2,300 years ago. The initial play
opening the game was a long for
i ! ward pass down the field. Harpas-
I turn, they called it. The Romans got
j the game from the Greeks, and Au
• gustus Caesar appointed a commis
1 | sion to revise the rules of the Gre

cian game and make it suitable to
military diversions for his legions.
The Romans took the game intc
Britain, where it thrived vigorously,
so much so, in fact, that in 1457
Henry VI decreed that "futeball and
golfe be utterly cryit doune and
nocht usit," as they interfered with
archery.
The English rules prohibited car
rying the ball, however, but in 1823
one William Webb Eliis, of Rugby,
got the inspiration to break up a
two-hour game by grabbing the ball
and dodging his way to the goal
line. This made such a hit that it
was permitted under new rules and

'the game of Rugby resulted.
The first intercollegiate football
game played in America occurred in J
1869, and was played by Princeton |
and Rutgers. In 1876 Yale, Harvard, 1
Columbia, and Princeton held a con- j
vention of the American Intercol- \
legiate Football Association and j
i adopted the Rugby rules with few
changes.
Then came more changes. Walter j
Camp—and American football; with
! its Knights of 1930 staging a peace-
I time war game in stadiums that
dwarf famous hippodromes, colos
| seums, and amphitheaters of antiq-
I uity.
