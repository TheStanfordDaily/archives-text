### 
"Physical education instructors
throughout the United States are,
for the most part, opposed to the
participation of women in the com
ing Olympics to be held in Los An
geles," stated Miss Gertrude Haw
ley, director of the Roble Gymna
sium, Saturday.
"Directors of physical education
for women have formed a national
society with western, middle-west
ern, and eastern branches," she said,
"and the concensus of opinion in all
three branches is that such meets
are harmful to the health of women.
In general, a girl is defending her
title in such an event, and competi
tion is of the keenest for her rivals
are alleged masters in their particu
lar sport.

for women have formed a national
society with western, middle-west
ern, and eastern branches," she said,
"and the concensus of opinion in all
three branches is that such meets
are harmful to the health of women.
In general, a girl is defending her
title in such an event, and competi
tion is of the keenest for her rivals

Athletes Overdo
"I was on the staff of the physical
education department at Northwest
em University for eleven years be
fore coming to Stanford. There Tom
Robinson was the swimming coach
both for men and for advanced wo
men swimmers. Because of this
many excellent swimmers came to
the University. When questioned on
the subject they admitted that com
petitive sportsmen take part in
meets in spite of ill health, many
times pushing themselves to a maxi
mum effort when they are below par
physically.
"Jn all my experience I have never
known a single case where spe
cializations in one sport has been
beneficial hygienically. The question
is, of course, still an open one, but
there can be no doubt that the ef
fect of strenuous competition upon
a woman's nervous system is harm
ful.
Aim Is Good Health
"In planning our physical educa
tion program here our primary aim
is general good health. Sports
should improve posture, develop
breathing and circulation, and aid
digestion. Probably swimming is the
sport which best accomplishes all
these ends.
"1 regret the lack of interest in
the West in gymnastics themselves.
At present the physical education
staff is considering making one
quarter of gymnastics one of the
department requirements while stu
dents are in Lower Division."
