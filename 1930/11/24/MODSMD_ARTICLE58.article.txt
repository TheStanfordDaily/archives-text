# SOCCER ELEVEN BEATEN BY U.C. IN FINAL GAME
## Offensive Weakness Main Factor In Defeat By 3-0 Score 
### 
Defensively weakened by ihjuries
and unable to make its offense click
sufficiently to cash in on scoring op
portunities, the Stanford soccer
team went down to a 3-0 defeat Sat
urday in the third and final game
of the annual Stanford-California
soccer series at Berkeley.
Having the wind at its back dur
ing the first half, the Cardinal eleven
took the offensive throughout that
period and had a number of chances
to score after working the ball down
within kicking distance of the goal,
but each time the over-anxiousness
and poor teamwork of the forwards
spoiled the attempt to tally. On
some occasions the forwards got in
each other's way while trying to get
a shot.
Just before the close of the first
period Christensen, Stanford center
half, kicked the ball into his own
goal while trying to kick it out of
danger, so the score was 1-0 for
California at the end of that half.
When the Redshirts left tlie field
at half-time without having made a
goal their chances were practically
gone, because during the second half
California had the advantage of the
wind, which was even stronger than
in the first part of the tiit.
In the final session all that the
Cards could do was to attempt to
keep the ball away from their goal,
since the wind made possible a con
tinuous Bear attack. Francis Smart,
captain and center forward of the
Berkeley aggregation, drove in two
more tallies to put the game on ice
for his team.
