# INDIAN ARTISTS EXHIBITING IN ART GALLERY ARE MOVEMENT LEADERS
## 
### FRANCIS JOHNSON 
Frcd Kabote, the most famous of
the Indian painters whose work is
now on exhibition in the Art Gal
lery, was once the star runner on
the Santa Fe High School track
team, according to Yvor Winters,
who taught there several years ago
and who is now an instructor in the
English department at Stanford.
Water color painting has been a
practice among the Pueblo Indians
of the Southwest for only about 15
years, according to Winters. Two
brothers, Awa-Tsireh and TaE,
started the movement in 1915 or
1916. They were only about IV years
old at the time.
Fred Kabote was the next to take
up the water-color painting. He
was the first to leave the traditional
Indian style of fiat painting of fig
ures, with no perspective at all, and
paint in the round.

Ma-We-Pi, who has several pic
tures hanging in the Art Gallery, i
started life as Velino Shije, but his j
name was taken away from him by !
his tribe because of his painting. He '
was the first to picture wild ani- !
mals, and he incurred the anger of
his tribe by copying these animals j
from the paintings on the insidej
wall of the kiva, which is the sacred
house <>t temple of the tribe. When
he returned to his home village on ;
a visit five, or six years ago the tribe j
beat him nearly to death, warned |
him to stay away, and took his tribal !
name from him.
Almost all the paintings are of fig- i
ures since the attempts of the In
dians to paint landscapes have so ]
far proved a failure. Fred Kabote,
however, seems to have perfected a
sort of landscape painting which is
just unrealistic enough to be good,
says Winters.
