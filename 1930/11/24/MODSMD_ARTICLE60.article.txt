# ENCINA GYMNASIUM HAS TROPHIES WON IN PAST CONTESTS
## Banner Donated For First California Game Is On Display 
### 
With the most decisive triumph
over obtained in Big Game competi
tion still a fresh and pleasant recol
lection in the minds of Stanford
f;ins, memories of post conflicts in
which the Cardinal has emerged
victorious may be expected to be
very much in evidence, as indeed
they were even before the battle.
There is one spot on the campus,
the Encina Gym trophy room, where
these memories find concrete ex
pression.
Cups, banners, plaques, pictures,
historic balls, and other relics of vic
tory are enclosed within the walls
of that room, and many an alumnus
back for the game dropped in there
to take another look at the trophy
his team won.
Of the greatest interest right now,
perhaps, is the ball used in the ia
jnous 20-20 tie game of 1924 in which
Stanford was saved from seemingly
certain defeat by a spectacular pass
ing attack in the last minutes of play.
That game was probably the most
spectacular of modern Big Games, if
mot of all-time, and is regarded as
the "game of a lifetime" by those
who saw it. The ball bears the le
gend: "S:2O—C:2O, Score—C:2o—S:6
with 5 min. of play. J. Lawson —Pop
Warner."
Another ball on display is the one
with which Stanford defeated West
Point in New York in 1928 by a 26-0
score. It is signed by the members
of the team and the coaching staff.
Associated with that game are a sil
ver tray, pitcher, and set of goblets
presented to the Card squad on its
return from New York by the City
of San Francisco.
One of the more ancient reminders
of Stanford-California contests is a
large leather banner ornamented
with an outline of the Memorial
Arch, which bears the team rosters
and scores during the regime of J. F,
Lanagan as head football coach. Ac
cording to the banner, Lanagan never
lost a Big Game, the scores being:
1903, 0-6; 1904, 18-0; 1905, 12-5; 1906,
6-3; 1907, 21-11.
What appears to be the oldest
souvenir in the collection is a very
much tattered and torn silk banner
bearing the inscription:
"Presented by Mrs. Leland Stan
ford, 1892."
It was given to the football team
after the first Big Game.

score. It is signed by the members
of the team and the coaching staff.
Associated with that game are a sil
ver tray, pitcher, and set of goblets
presented to the Card squad on its
return from New York by the City
of San Francisco.
One of the more ancient reminders
of Stanford-California contests is a
large leather banner ornamented
with an outline of the Memorial
Arch, which bears the team rosters
and scores during the regime of J. F,
Lanagan as head football coach. Ac
cording to the banner, Lanagan never
lost a Big Game, the scores being:
1903, 0-6; 1904, 18-0; 1905, 12-5; 1906,
6-3; 1907, 21-11.
What appears to be the oldest
souvenir in the collection is a very
much tattered and torn silk banner
bearing the inscription:
"Presented by Mrs. Leland Stan
ford, 1892."
It was given to the football team
after the first Big Game.
With the most decisive triumph
over obtained in Big Game competi
tion still a fresh and pleasant recol
lection in the minds of Stanford
f;ins, memories of post conflicts in
which the Cardinal has emerged
victorious may be expected to be
very much in evidence, as indeed
they were even before the battle.
There is one spot on the campus,
the Encina Gym trophy room, where
these memories find concrete ex
pression.
Cups, banners, plaques, pictures,
historic balls, and other relics of vic
tory are enclosed within the walls
of that room, and many an alumnus
back for the game dropped in there
to take another look at the trophy
his team won.
Of the greatest interest right now,
perhaps, is the ball used in the ia
jnous 20-20 tie game of 1924 in which
Stanford was saved from seemingly
certain defeat by a spectacular pass
ing attack in the last minutes of play.
That game was probably the most
spectacular of modern Big Games, if
mot of all-time, and is regarded as
the "game of a lifetime" by those
who saw it. The ball bears the le
gend: "S:2O—C:2O, Score—C:2o—S:6
with 5 min. of play. J. Lawson —Pop
Warner."
Another ball on display is the one
with which Stanford defeated West
Point in New York in 1928 by a 26-0
score. It is signed by the members
of the team and the coaching staff.
Associated with that game are a sil
ver tray, pitcher, and set of goblets
presented to the Card squad on its

of San Francisco.
