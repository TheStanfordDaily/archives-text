# THREE OVERSTAY LATE LEAVES ON BIG GAME NIGHT
## 
### 
A LTHOUGH 107 Stanford wo
men signed out for 3 o'clock
late leaves on Big Game night,
only three received lock-outs.
All of the 52 Roble women who
signed out for the additional
half-hour granted for the occa
sion, returned before the final
closing of the doors, according
to Mrs. Ina Mort, night matron.
At Roble 20 of the women
who took 3 o'clock leaves were
in before 12 o'clock.
The extra late leave was
given by Council to encourage
women to return to the cam
pus instead of taking over
night leaves. In spite of it many
stayed in the city in preference
to coming back to the campus.
