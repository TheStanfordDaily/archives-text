CARLIN, Nov., Nov. 24.—(Exclu
sive) —The Dartmouth football spe
cial, which has taken on the aspect
of an educational tour, rolled over
prairie and desert today toward its
objective and the Green will work
out on Stanford's field tomorrow
afternoon for the first time.
The most welcome greeter Palo
Alto will have for the team will be
Sid Hazelton, Varsity coach who
scouted the Stanford-California Big
Game. Jackson Cannel, Dartmouth
head coach, is eagerly awaiting Ha
zel ton's reports, for around them he
will fashion the Green attack. It is
felt that the aerial game will be the
only hope for Dartmouth, and this
will be practiced religiously for the
next four days in Palo Alto.
Only One Practice
So far only one practice has been
held, that in Chicago, and the only
form of exercises has come through
snowbnll fights in Nevada and rock
throwing contests at the great Salt
Lake. There has been no definite
routine on the trip and the men are
all in the highest of spirits with no
illness or injury reported.
Never Came West Before
The majority of the players on this
trip have never been west in their
lives, and descriptions of California
given to them by train officials en
route are still in the unbelievable
stage, for during the past two days
the team has gone through heavy
snows and biting winter weather.
The squad is due in Palo Alto
early tomorrow afternoon after stop
ping at headquarters in San Mateo
first.
