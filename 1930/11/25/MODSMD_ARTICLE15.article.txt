# GRIDMEN REST AS DARTMOUTH SQUAD ARRIVES
## Easterners To Detrain In Oakland This Morning At 7:55 O'clock 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
While the undefeated Big Green
Team from Dartmouth was speeding
westward near the end of its five
day coast-to-coast journey to the
I Farm, Coach Glenn Scobey "Pop"
Warner devoted yesterday afternoon
! to golf, and his grid warriors en
joyed a rest before swinging into
the final week of preparation for the
intersectional classic.
Today's workout behind the high
i green fence will begin the last lap
of practice for the Redshirts as they
i buckle down to the serious business
' of preparing to turn back the inva
â–  sion of one of the best teams the
I East has to offer.
No Injuries
Regardless of the 41 to 0 trouncing
that the Cards administered to the
Blue and Gold eleven Saturday, they
felt they had been through a battle,
and the lay-off yesterday should do
no harm. A check-up on the men
after the game revealed that they
came through without any serious
injuries. Some of the fans were wor
ried when Neill had to leave the
game, but it was revealed that he
j simply had the tape too tight around
his injured ribs and found it hard
to breathe.
Tandy's old knee injury received
a jar and might possibly keep him
out of the Dartmouth tussle. At
1 least he will be in far from perfect
1 condition. K. Albertson's shoulder
was badly bruised, and Mar Albert
! son is still on the crippled list.
Green Line Heavier
A weight check-up between the
two outfits, though it may mean
'little or nothing, shows that the in-
I vading line has an edge of about five
I pounds to the man. However, this
is offset by a heavier Card backfield,
: though the line difference might give
l the visitors a chance to give a fast
backfield a good running start.
The Dartmouth party of 70, in
deluding players, trainers, coaches
i and supporters, are scheduled to ar
-1 rive at the Oakland Mole at 7:55
! this morning, where they will be
met by line Coach "Tiny" Thornhill,
"Dink" Templcton, Alfred Masters,
Professor William Owens, and Don
Liebendorfer.
They will be ferried across the
bay, and then whisked down via bus
to the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in
San Mateo, where they will make
their headquarters. Here they will
be met by Pop Warner and other
Stanford representatives.
The green-clad warriors will work
out in the Stadium, while the Old
: Fox will drill his men in secret be
hind the closed gates of the practice
; field.
