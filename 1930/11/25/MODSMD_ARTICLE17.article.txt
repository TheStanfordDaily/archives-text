| "I'm afraid of Dartmouth—afraid j
j that they will out-power us here
j Saturday," remarked Pop Warner j

last night. Com- :
fortably seated in |
the Warner parlor
in Palo Alto, the ,
"O Id Fo x" was
thin k in g of the
final combat on
the Cardinal']
schedule, and such
thought was not as ,

i pleasant as he might desire,
i "Undefeated in the East, and on
j par with Colgate, Army and the best
i in that section, Dartmouth will be
1 tough," he continued. "In fact, Dart
mouth may be expected to win Sat
j urday."
Pointing out that the Green team
i had a five pound pull in the line,
and the reputation of Cannell's for
. ward wall vied with that of the
! Rock of Gibraltar, Warner justified
; his views.
"If we had the team which went
East in 1928 to defeat the Army, I'd
| feel more confident. But we haven I
j the outfit that Stanford possessed
I then. We are weak in the line—and
j here it is that Dartmouth shows best/

"California made us look, bad at
times—their line played as well as
ours did, as a matter of fact." War
ner reached for another cigarette,
and paused for a moment. Evidently
the coming game bothered him more
than the California game had.
In answer to the suggestion that
because California had beaten St.
Mary's and St. Mary's had" defeated
Fordham, Stanford should rate above
the Eastern teams, Warner hastened
to reply that California had gone
down hill since she won from the
Moragans.
"California has not the same team
she had when she downed Madi
gan's men," he declared. "If the two
teams played again, the score would
be vastly different. Injuries crippled
the Blue and Gold after that game,
and their team never showed the
same spirit.
"It should be a great battle Sat
urday," he went on, "for the East
is about due to win an intcrsectional
contest. Those teams are getting
tired of hearing about Western su
premacy. Dartmouth has a great
team; we have not the outfit which
played for Stanford in 1928 or 1929.
I expect Dartmouth to win."
