# WOMEN TO SELL SEASON TICKETS
## Commission Given To Aid New Gym Fund 
### 
I Stanford women will receive a
, commission for selling A.S.S.U. con- ;
; cert series season tickets which will j
go to the new gym fund, according '
!to an agreement between Carl Mc-
Dowell, concert manager, and Louise
I Artz, W.A.A. president.
Ten percent of the first 150 tickets
Isold, together with a $25 bonus will
i be given to the fund and a further
' 15 per cent commission will be al
| lowed for any sold over this quota.
"This agreement will give the stu
dents an opportunity to aid their
own student concert series, which
I cannot exist without their support,
j as well as to assist in raising money
to equip the new gymnasium," said
Gertrude Laidlaw, in charge of the
campaign.
Expensive Artists
The A.S.S.U. office this year en
gaged more expensive artists than
usual, anticipating a greater sale of
season tickets due, to obtaining the
I United States Marine Band for the
j first concert and the general finan
cial situation has caused the possi
bility of a large deficit unless 300
I more season tickets are sold, accord
ing to McDowell.
The next attraction on the series
is the concert to be given December
4, by Elizabeth Rcthborg, interna
tionally known soprano. Other con
certs scheduled for the year include
Harold Bauer, pianist, San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, and Paul Ro
i' boson, Negro baritone.
Men to Assist
The campaign will be carried on
in the women's living groups, and
the men and the residents of Palo
Alto are also being asked to co
| operate.
The following are the represenia
! tives of the work of the gym com
