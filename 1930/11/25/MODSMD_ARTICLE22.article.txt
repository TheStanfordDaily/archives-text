night, "The co-ordination between
the roting section and the yell lead
ers was perfect."
The three yell leaders, McKee,
Harris, and Woyl, also expressed
thanks and congratulations for the
co-operation given them at the
game.
A letter of thanks will be sent ta
the University of California Rally

on how to keep outsiders from the
rooting section.

voted to continue plans for stunts
