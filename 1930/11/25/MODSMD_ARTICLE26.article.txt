## EDITOR ARLETT REINSTATED BY EX COMMITTEE Coach Includes Basketball Duties In Resignation Given Last Night GIVEN YEAR'S SALARY 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 24. (/P)—Clar
! cncc M. "Nibs" Price, head football
j and basketball coach at the Univer
! sity of California, tonight tendered
1 his resignation from both posts to
i the student executive committee.
I The resignation was accepted.
Price's resignation was the eve
ning's second development in the
Berkeley institution's campus and
gridiron war that has been raging
! for the past two weeks. Earlier at
' the same committee meeting, Ar-
I thur M. Arlett, editor of The Daily
Californian, who had been ousted
last week by the executive commit
tee for editorials directed against
the California football season and
professionalism of athletes, was
reinstated under compromise con
ditions.
Three Motions
j In acting on Price's resignation,
j the executive committee passed
j three motions:
1. That the resignation be ac
cepted.
2. That as Price's contract does
not expire until June .1932, the gen
| eral manager be instructed to pay
I Price his next year's salary now.
3. That the matter of hiring new
I coaches be turned over to the Ath
| letic Council with the recommenda-
I tion that Price be rehired as head
I basketball coach. *
1 When he learned that the cxccu
! tive committee had accepted his
I resignation, Price last night issued
j the following statement: "My resig
; nation was due to my belief that, it
was the only way to prevent the
dissension that was bound to follow
the present unsuccessful football
season. The way is now open for
discussion free from embarrassment
clue to personalities. No coach can
j hope for success without the sup
| port of public opinion as repre
j sented by the alumni. Since it has
been apparent that the support is
I lacking in my case, no other course
consistent with the good of the uni
! versity was open to me than to re
. sign.
