# NIBS PRICE RESIGNS COACHING POSITIONS AT BERKELEY
## EDITOR ARLETT REINSTATED BY EX COMMITTEE Coach Includes Basketball Duties In Resignation Given Last Night GIVEN YEAR'S SALARY 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 24. (/P)—Clar
! cncc M. "Nibs" Price, head football
j and basketball coach at the Univer
! sity of California, tonight tendered
1 his resignation from both posts to
i the student executive committee.
I The resignation was accepted.
Price's resignation was the eve
ning's second development in the
Berkeley institution's campus and
gridiron war that has been raging
! for the past two weeks. Earlier at
' the same committee meeting, Ar-
I thur M. Arlett, editor of The Daily
Californian, who had been ousted
last week by the executive commit
tee for editorials directed against
the California football season and
professionalism of athletes, was
reinstated under compromise con
ditions.
Three Motions
j In acting on Price's resignation,
j the executive committee passed
j three motions:
1. That the resignation be ac
cepted.
2. That as Price's contract does
not expire until June .1932, the gen
| eral manager be instructed to pay
I Price his next year's salary now.
3. That the matter of hiring new
I coaches be turned over to the Ath
| letic Council with the recommenda-
I tion that Price be rehired as head
I basketball coach. *
1 When he learned that the cxccu
! tive committee had accepted his
I resignation, Price last night issued
j the following statement: "My resig
; nation was due to my belief that, it
was the only way to prevent the
dissension that was bound to follow
the present unsuccessful football
season. The way is now open for
discussion free from embarrassment
clue to personalities. No coach can
j hope for success without the sup
| port of public opinion as repre
j sented by the alumni. Since it has
been apparent that the support is
I lacking in my case, no other course
consistent with the good of the uni
! versity was open to me than to re
. sign.
Thanks Staff
"I desire to express my sincere
appreciation for the loyalty of my
staff and of the boys v/hom I have
had the privilege of coaching. To
my successor I wish the utmost suc
; cess."
Stern Altshuler, president of the
; associated students, issued a state-
I ment, saying that the resignation of
Price was received with regret by
I the committee. "Price acted his part
i like a real man," said the California
i student head.
Immediately after learning the
| decision of the executive committee,
I Price, with W. W. Monahan, Cali
fornia graduate manager, left the
! meeting place, and his whereabouts
{were unascertainable. Mrs. Price,
i called at her home, said her husband
j would not return until tomorrow.
In an effort to quiet all discussion
£ind dissension on the Berkeley cam
pus, the executive committee at the
same meeting reinstated Arthur M.
Arlett as editor of The Daily Cali
fornian. In the future Arlett will be
required to print his editorials under
the slogan, "These editorials ex
press the opinions of the editor, and
not of the student executive com
mittee."
Informed of Price's resignation,
Coach Pop - Warner last night said
that he had always thought the
diminutive Bear mentor a good
coach and a good sport.
"Price was unfortunate," said
Warner, "in taking over the reins
when California was on the down
grade. I do not think that the late
Andy Smith could have done any
better than 'Nibs' under the cir
cumstances."
