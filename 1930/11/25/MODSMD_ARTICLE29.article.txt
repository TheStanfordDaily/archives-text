# A 						TASTY INTELLECTUAL FARE
## 
### 
I onight at 7: M) o'clock in the Assemble I lull the Committee on.
Public Kxercises will present another program of the regular Tues-'
day evening lecture series. Week-.in and week out. for a score of
years, men and women have been coming to Stanford with a mes
sage for students of this I'niversitv.
\\ eek in and week out the audience has been composed of faculty
members. I'alo \lto residents, and a sprinkling of students. And
that combination must be something of a disappointment to a lec
turer w ho has come prepared to speak to college people.
The saddest thing is not that the lecturer is disappointed, but
that Stanford students are passing up an intellectual gold-mine. ;
Some of the lectures are undeniably boresome. but many more con
tain enough educational and inspirational value to be worth five
units of classroom study.
The average Stanford student is not crammed so full of knowl
edge that he can afford to pass up the intellectual fare offered here
every week in the form of these lectures.
