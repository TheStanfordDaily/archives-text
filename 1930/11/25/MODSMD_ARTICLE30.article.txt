Among the .bigger and better things being planned for bigger I
and better Stanford women by the Department of Physical Educa
tion for Women is the requirement of a quarter's work with the 1
dumbbells and other gymnastic paraphernalia.
(iranted that mere man knows nothing of proper exercises for i
women, it does seem foolish for Stanford to inaugurate a required 1
â€¢ nurse in gymnastics because gymnastics are the cutest things and
are all the rage in the Hast.
A member of the Koble gymnasium staff said she was disap
pointed that Stanford women were not interested in gymnastics.
Yet. because this muscular exercise is so popular in eastern institu-j
lions, it is planned to apply the Swedish roll and other forms of
gymnastic culture on Stanford women.
