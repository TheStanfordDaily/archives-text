# PHENOMENAL EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE
## 
### 
\. J. I'rumbaugh, associate dean at the I'niversity of Chicago,!
lias endeared himself to the hearts of many students with his state
ment that college men and women are now forced to sacrifice their
studies to the need of working to support themselves. As a result,
Dean lirumbaugh declares, grades are hound to suffer.
The ( hicago dean's comment arouses two questions in the reader's
mind :
1. W hat is all this talk about young ])eople, unable to securel
work, enrolling in college and waiting for the present economic
slump to remedy itself? and,
2. 11" students have to work so hard that their grades suffer, whv ;
don't the\ drop from school and go to work?
This year's registration in \merican colleges was the largest in
several years. It was contrary to forecasts put out b\ registrars and
bursars that the attendance would decrease. It was contrary to ex
pectations of educators that the economic condition of the country
Would affect the educational program. i
The situation is a phenomenal one. In ordinary years a needy
student would temporarily cease his efforts to acquire an education
and would devote himself to raising funds to continue later.
There is no doubt but that the college student is affected by the
so-called economic stringency prevailing at present. It is quite com
mendable of the I'niversity of Chicago dean to encourage needv
students to devote more time to work and less to study provided his
educational standards are not lowered.
