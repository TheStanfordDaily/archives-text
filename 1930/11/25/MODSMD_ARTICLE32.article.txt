# WOMAN'S PRIVILEGE IS TO CHANGE HER MIND
## 
### 
That the sorority women of the campus will not tolerate viola
tions of the Pan-Hellenic bidding contract was a conclusion too
hastily reached by this column last week when Kappa .Alpha Theta
was penalized for illegal bidding. After the decision of the joint
committee had been handed down to and ratified by Pan-Hellenic, a
further meeting of the committee was called for "discussion and
interpretation" of the resolution. The result was the virtual revo
cation of the punishment "in the interest of the morale of Roble."
While there is little doubt that the purpose of the committee was
a lofty one — that of alleviating unfavorable and continued unrest
among the new women — it is doubtful whether the reinterpretation
will help matters. The Theta blunder has resulted in considerable
turmoil and premature "sorority-consciousness" which will probably
persist until the end of spring rushing, despite reinterpretations, re-
considerations, rediscussion, and what-not.
The recent action of the committee has furthermore made Pan-
Hellenic and its bidding contract look extremely silly. The recent
action is proof of the weakness of a body which ought to be one of
the strong factors of the campus. It is not improbable that further
violations of the contract will ensue.
Staff meeting at 1 o'clock this afternoon. Important.
