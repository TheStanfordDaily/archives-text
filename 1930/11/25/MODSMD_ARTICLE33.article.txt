ANGEL PAVEMENT. By J. B. J
Priestly. Harper & Bros., New j
York, 19:10. (At the Palo Alto J
Book hop.)
The title of Priestley's latest book
is misleading. Angels smack of the
upper regions, but "Artgel Pave
ment" is the story of some very !
ordinary office slaves in the heart 112
of London. Golspie, hailing from
somewhere along the Baltic, brings '
a touch of romance and glamour I
into their lives, this sudden depart
ure leaving them with a memory
and little else.
Priestley carefully, almost minute- j
ly, describes the five or six main j
characters' lives. At the end of the •
book one practically knows their
subconscious reactions. Priestley
writes much in the same manner as
the Germans such as Wasserman,
only the Englishman possesses more
humor and less weight.
"Angel Pavement" will not be
forgotten quickly. It is a lasting
1 book, one that can stand constant
rereading. It is a tale of typically
English people, yet readers all over 1

| the world will understand and ap
| preeiate it. This alone proves it to j
ibe good literature. —N. J. \
LAVA. By Arniinc von Tempski. j
Frederick A. Stokes Co., New j
York. (At the Falo Alto |
Book Shop.)
A novel of adventure very similar I
: to former volumes by the same au- j
thor is Armine von Tempski's i
! "Lava," repeating as it does the !
I Hawaiian formula which so pleased ,
those who like that sort of thing in i
"Ilula," "Dust," and "Fire."
I Very obviously, "Lava" is not in j
j the least a "saga of Hawaii" as it is !
j somewhat ambitiously described in \
a sub-title. It is merely a light and |
simple story whose chief claim to i
recognition is an evidently authentic i
background and some well-done dei
scriptions of the torpical scene.
Readers who expect to find any i
real character-study or any but the :
most superficial consideration of |
Hawaiian life will be disappointed in j
'Lava." Others to whom the writer's !
previous tales were entertaining ro

ANGEL PAVEMENT. By J. B. J
Priestly. Harper & Bros., New j
York, 19:10. (At the Palo Alto J
Book hop.)
The title of Priestley's latest book
is misleading. Angels smack of the
upper regions, but "Artgel Pave
ment" is the story of some very !
ordinary office slaves in the heart 112
of London. Golspie, hailing from
somewhere along the Baltic, brings '
a touch of romance and glamour I
into their lives, this sudden depart
ure leaving them with a memory
and little else.
Priestley carefully, almost minute- j
ly, describes the five or six main j
characters' lives. At the end of the •
book one practically knows their
subconscious reactions. Priestley
writes much in the same manner as
the Germans such as Wasserman,
only the Englishman possesses more
humor and less weight.
"Angel Pavement" will not be
forgotten quickly. It is a lasting
1 book, one that can stand constant
rereading. It is a tale of typically
English people, yet readers all over 1

| the world will understand and ap
| preeiate it. This alone proves it to j
ibe good literature. —N. J. \
LAVA. By Arniinc von Tempski. j

I Hawaiian formula which so pleased ,
