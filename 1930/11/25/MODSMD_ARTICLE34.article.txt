Read in The Daily, yesterday, that |
only three women had three o'clock
lockouts, Saturday night. Twenty
who had signed out for the extra
late-leave were home before mid
night. Maybe they'd lost their live
dollars?
If their student escorts were as
. dumb and spiritless that night as i
they were during the game in the
afternoon, and as they had been at
the Bonfire Rally, two days before, !
, the girls can't be blamed for want
ing to be rid of them earl}\
Maybe too many victories are
cloying sweets, and we need a few
defeats to wake us up. It's the last
thing a loyal Stanfordite would agi
tate in favor of—but too many of
us are loyal transfers from other ,
people's colleges, and choose to sit
by and watch our friends get ex
cited while we take it easy.
Or. we might ask. "When is a
i rough not a rough?" "When he
won't get excited about rough-

ing it up for an opponent."'
Are Stanford women self-confi- i
dent? or don't they worry about .
social errors like broken shoe
strings? or do they enjoy being dif
ferent even in such minor mattei's?
or what? In a mixed class, the other
day, a professor remarked that some
common human fault is "almost as
bad as a woman appearing in public j
with a shiny nose." He stopped, and j
exactly nothing happened. The same i
statement, made at a women's col- !
lege, a short time ago, promptly
brought forth seven hundred pow
der puffs and mirrors, for the im
provement of just that many noses.
Maybe our Five Hundred learn
make-up secrets from magazine ads
of Hollywood stars, and have noses
that are patently dull (that couldn't
be a pun, could it?). Now if some
one will invent some sort of guar
antee that we won't have to see
crooked seams on their stockings,
everything will be o-koed.

or what? In a mixed class, the other
day, a professor remarked that some
common human fault is "almost as
bad as a woman appearing in public j
with a shiny nose." He stopped, and j
exactly nothing happened. The same i
statement, made at a women's col- !
lege, a short time ago, promptly
brought forth seven hundred pow
der puffs and mirrors, for the im
provement of just that many noses.
Maybe our Five Hundred learn
make-up secrets from magazine ads
of Hollywood stars, and have noses
that are patently dull (that couldn't
be a pun, could it?). Now if some
one will invent some sort of guar
antee that we won't have to see
crooked seams on their stockings,
everything will be o-koed.
Read in The Daily, yesterday, that |
only three women had three o'clock
lockouts, Saturday night. Twenty
who had signed out for the extra
late-leave were home before mid
night. Maybe they'd lost their live
dollars?
If their student escorts were as
. dumb and spiritless that night as i
they were during the game in the
afternoon, and as they had been at
the Bonfire Rally, two days before, !
, the girls can't be blamed for want
ing to be rid of them earl}\
Maybe too many victories are
cloying sweets, and we need a few
defeats to wake us up. It's the last
thing a loyal Stanfordite would agi
tate in favor of—but too many of
us are loyal transfers from other ,
people's colleges, and choose to sit
by and watch our friends get ex
cited while we take it easy.
Or. we might ask. "When is a
i rough not a rough?" "When he
won't get excited about rough-

ing it up for an opponent."'
Are Stanford women self-confi- i
dent? or don't they worry about .
social errors like broken shoe
strings? or do they enjoy being dif
ferent even in such minor mattei's?
