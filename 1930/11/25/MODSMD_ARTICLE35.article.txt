## HE CHASED THEM: THEY DIDN'T 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last Monday The Daily published
! an article concerning the capturing
of a drunk-crazed negro by certain
' Stanford students. The story, which
stated that Calvin Flint fled was
; wrong. The three students men
tioned in the article went to the
rescue of a white family which was
being attacked by an inebriated
negro armed with a knife.
The pajama-clad students at 4
o'clock in the morning were suc
cessful in getting the negro to turn
, upon them, and then they retreated
to their home where they held off
his attack with a .22 caliber rifle
until the police were summoned.
| lam writing this to clear up the
misunderstanding which was created
I by your article on the conduct of
Calvin Flint.
