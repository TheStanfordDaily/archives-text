# A BIT TARDY, BUT GOOD

The Editor, Sir:
If a rowdy, boisterous element of
outsiders is contaminating our roof
ing section and giving it a bad name,
why not warn, evict, or refuse to
admit these undesirables according
to the degree of their obnoxious
ness?
A drunk or hoodlum is a disgrace
to the A.S.S.U.; why tl len permit
him to sit through the game?
If the Rally Committee must in
vestigate, let them take the name
and ticket numbers; but it would
be of little or no good to do this
alone.
Rowdies are easily located, and
can be ousted. Why not use the
good old Wilbur-Culver combina
tion: kick them out first, investigate
them afterwards?
