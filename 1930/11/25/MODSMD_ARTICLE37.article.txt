Is it. necessary for col lege men on
the Stanford campus lo inflict on us
at rallies such cheap and vulgar wit
as we heard the night of the Big

1 Game rally, from the last speaker
on the program? That type of humor
can hardly be forgiven small-town
1 Rotarians who make no claims to a
knowledge of what is fitting afid
proper—let alone college men.
In college men such so-called hu
mor is either pretense or pathetic
lack of breeding.
Oft with the "he-man" stuff! It has
no place when men are really men.
