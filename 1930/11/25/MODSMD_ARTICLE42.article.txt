Down from the north the sad
news came,
To check the activities of fair
young swains.
From the' University of Utah one
learns that holding hands and kiss
i ing should not be indulged in as it
' causes the spread of trenchmouth.
It is really remarkable how many
j things can be caused by these two
little procedures of holding hands
and kissing.
| The psychologist says it brings
, about sex complexes; the educator
claims that it results in poor schol
i arship; the confectioner states that
|it boosts business; and now the ,
j biologist says that it causes a ter
; rible disease.
Temple University is offering a |
: course in social poise. One has dif—
j liculty in defining this term, but a
! good test to see whether one pos
] sesses this subtle grace can be had
I by a co-ed at no cost.
If an attractive woman can

walk down the study room of a
campus library at 8:30 o'clock
in the evening, drop a notebook
and pick it up naturally—that
is. without forced nonchalance
or high school embarrassment—
then that co-ed is endowed with
poise plus.
A note of cheer for those that
have been eating away from home
for some years is to be found in the
dispatch from the University of
Oregon which states that soup is
clean even if a dirty hand has been
dipped in it during its preparation.
One can only hope that local chef's
will not take advantage of this
latest finding of science to use soup
cauldrons for wash basins.
The barber at Swarthmore Col
lege gives free haircuts to the foot
ball players whenever they win.
Chirotonsors probably do not lose
much at this college, but it would
keep a whole barber's college busy
performing similar functions at
U.S.C.
