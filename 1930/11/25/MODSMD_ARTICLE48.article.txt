TIIAT GREEN WAVE
Sweeping westward from frozen
Ni'w England, a band of 39 foot
ball plnycrs representing Dartmouth
College will arrive here today. Un
defeated in their own back yard,
Jackson Cannell's crew will attempt
to do what the Army could not—
beat Stanford.
With the proceeds of the game
going to the aid of unemploy
ment, the tilt is worthy of the
hacking of al! the citizens of the
bay region. But not only because
of the worthy support which the
clash will lend to charity, but
also on its merit as a loothall
spectacle will it be worth watch
ing.
It will be a battle of Warner sys
tern Saturday, a clash of pass of
fense with pass offense, reverses
v/ill meet reverses any way you look
;it it—for Cannell has installed a
one wing-back Warner olfense at
Dartmouth, plus a few ideas of his
own.
Can the pupil beat the mas
ter? That is one question which
will lie ansvVered Saturday—a
question which will crop up
again when Stanford play s in the
East next year, and when
Northwestern meets the Cards
in 1 and 1 For Dick Ilan
ley at the Big Ten institution
teaches Warner tricks too, and
very effectively.
But Ihe 19.10 Big Bed Machine,
showing steady improvement
through the long month of Novem
ber, will be right for its final test
of the season. While the Warnermen
may be slow in starting, the devas
tating finishes they produce leave
deep scars on opponents' hides.
California's once Golden Bears
"will testify with their seven lean
years what Warner can do in
November. Saturday's session,
while not a perfect one, never
theless showed a steady increase
in smoothness with which the
attack functioned, a scoring
threat which Dartmouth can
well fear.
All of which brings us back to the
Large Slaughter. While the city
papers praise Little Bill Laird, we
should like to say a word for Little
William Clark, Stanford's own hard
luck half. All he did was go 3G
yards on the first shot of the game,
only to be called back because a
Cardinal held.
That gallop of Clark's went
past every California back, for
he made the clear without a
trace of interference. Garrity
and Griffiths fell before his
straight-arm. East and Kirwan
were out-stepped, and Clark
made the scoring /one without
a hand molesting him for the
most spectacular play of the
game, bar none.
And Harlow Rothert, alias Harold
Rothbert to the metropolitan masses,
proved as an all-round back there
is no one on the Coast to compare
with him. Half or ful L passer or
pass-receiver, blocker or ball-car
rier, Rothert fits all roles. Three
touchdowns he contributed to Cali
fornia's downfall.
Caddell's speed. Moffatt's
smoothness, llillman's power,
Caglieri's drive, Simians' tosses,
Bardin and Hulcn's heavy duty
at guard, Grey's great showing
at tackle, Doub's finest game to
date at end—the list is endless
of the men who worked for the
crushing Cardinal triumph.
That new "delayed reverse," which
saw Rothert make 23 yards and
which baffled everybody who
watched it, was just one of those
things, according to reports from
the huddle. It seems that half the
team thought Caddel was to carry
the ball on a severse, while the other
half thought that Rothert was
elected to pack the ball. When Ili 11—
man, faking the ball to Caddel,
found that he was there alone,
Rothert came along and took the
ball to solve the problem. The rest
is history.
Don Colvin made two letters
in the Big Game. By his playing
time, he cinched a Block "S"'
for himself, and by Stanford's
win, he took Joe Hickingboth
an's "C" through a bet placed
earlier in the season.
