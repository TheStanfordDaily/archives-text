# Bunn Prepares Cage Squad For Tough Season
## COACH STRESSES FUNDAMENTALS IN PRACTICE DRILLS Bunn To Make Card Guards Scoring Threats With Long Shooting 
### 
Individual fundamentals and fun
-1 damental plays are occupying the
attention of Coach John Bunn and
his varsity basketball aspirants
these fine fall days in preparation
i for the seventeen-game schedule
which will face the cage team be
i ginning December 23.
Scrimmages and chalk-talks form
' part of the practice programs, but a
j great deal of time is still being de
j voted to details of individual work.
Bunn teaches a style of play
j which sounds somewhat reminiscent
of football, including "triple-threat"
guards and "getting low under your
man." He intends to make the
Stanford guards scoring threats by
using long shots to a great extent,
and expects these tactics to make
his general attack more effective by
crossing up the defensive men.
Playing low when in possession
of the ball makes it possible to
break through a close guarding de
fensive player and prevents him
from forcing the man with the ball
off balance, Bunn says.
Owing to the fact that about one
half of the players on the squad
are seniors who will graduate after
this season, the cage coach will be
forced to carry a large squad
j through the year in order to have
an experienced nucleus for next
year's team. He intends to keep ap
proximately thirty men.
Since the first game comes before
Christmas, there will be no let-up
in practice sessions during the va
] cation, but most of the squad will
lay off during the Thanksgiving
I holiday.
