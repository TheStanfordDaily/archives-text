# WOLVERINE'S LEADER
## Simrall, Halfback And Captain Of Michigan Grid Team, Stars As Defensive Linesman And Pass Receiver 
### Feg Murray, '16 
J. Harrison Simrall, halfback and
] captain of the University of Michi
j gan football team, is one of the two
1 Wolverine ball-carriers whom Coach
! Yost mentioned to me-last year as
being "real players." Dahlem, if you
are interested, was the other one.
j That was the day after the Harvard
| Michigan game at Ann Arbor, and
j Simrall had played a bang-up game
I for Kipke's team, intercepting a
I Harvard pass at one crucial stage of
| the game to turn the tide in favor
of the home team.
I Simrall has, no doubt, enjoyed
| leading the Wolverines to successes
' over Purdue, Ohio State, Illinois.
I and Harvard. As Harvard and Min
nesota were the only major teams
| beaten last season, the year 1930
| can be looked on with much satis
i faction by those who take Wolverine
football very much to heart. Michi-

gan should beat Chicago, too, when
they meet on November 22 at Ann
Arbor.
Captain Simrall has distinguished
himself by his play in many of the
team's victories to date. He is a
fine defensive player, and his splen
did backing up of the line has done
a lot to keep Michigan's powerful
rivals in check. As a pass l'eceiver
he has starred, too, and he carries
the ball occasionally with good ef
fect. In the Illinois game he was
i knocked as cold as a kippered her
ring, carried off the field and into
the hospital, where he revived in
time to 'hear the end of the game
over the radio.
Simrall is from the Blue Grass
state, is twenty years old—quite
young for a Senior—weighs around
i 160 pounds, and is five feet ten
| inches tall.
