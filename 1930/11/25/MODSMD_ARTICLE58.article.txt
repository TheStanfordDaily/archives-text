# ADAMS SETS NEW RIFLE SHOT RECORD
## 
### 
Breaking a world's record, tying
another, and taking three other first
places in the State Open Rifle Shoot
at Colton, California, "Hank" Adams
successfully represented Stanford in
competition with Army, Navy, and
unattached rifle shooters.
Perfect scoring in the 100-yard
straight shooting match won "Hank"
his world record. His score of 10
hits out of 10 shots in a cne-inch
bullseye has never been equalled.
In the 300-meter kneeling match he
tied the existing world's record.
