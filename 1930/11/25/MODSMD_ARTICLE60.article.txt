# DELTA TAU DELTA GRIDDERS WIN LEAGUE II CHAMPIONSHIP CONTEST
## 
### 
Crushing the hitherto undefeated
Fijis, 31-0, Delta Tau Delta's power
ful touch football team v/on the
championship of League II yester
. day afternoon. Theta Chi received
one of the six forfeits of the day to
gain the premier honors of League I.
Slight favorites before the Fiji
burial, the Delts upset the dope
bucket by their overwhelming vic
tory. An irresistable running attack
and a dash of psychology were the
two outstanding reasons for this
scoring spree.
Before the start of the game, the
Delts proposed that it be played on
j the grassy, level Grays' field in
stead of the rough, dirt gridiron
where it was scheduled. The Fijis
would not agree to the transfer, pos
i sibly because they thought the Delta
speedsters might find the Grays field
; too much like a track oval.
j Eddy received the kick-off for the
Delts and started up the right side
of the field. Just as he was entering
a mass of Fiji tacklers he stopped
j aKd threw a long lateral pass across
j the field to Werder, who carried the
ball down to the 20-yard line before
i being run out of bounds. Behind
I

ttood interference Werder swept
around end for ten yeards. Henry
I duplicated this performance around j
j the other end for a touchdown.
After receiving the kickoff the
j Fijis tried a flat pass to the right
i which Ross Nichols, greatest of all
Cardinal high jumpers, pulled down
| and carried over for a touchdown,
j Following the next kick-off, six
I more end runs by Werder and
| Nichol gave the Delts their third
touchdown before the end of the
j first five minutes of play.
Stubborn resistance by the Fijis,
numerous substitutions, and use of
! passes slowed up point manufacture
! somewhat after this, but the Delts
had rammed across two more touch-
I downs before the final whistle.
I Phi Kappa Sigma came back with
n rush after the Theta Delts had
drawn first blood to score a 13-6 win
and to clinch second place in League
I in the other game of the afternoon.
El Campo forfeited to Kappa
' Alpha, Sequoia I forfeited to the
Alpha Delts, El Tigre to Sigma ;
Alpha Epsilon, and the Medics to ■
Delta Chi in the other scheduled i
i games.
