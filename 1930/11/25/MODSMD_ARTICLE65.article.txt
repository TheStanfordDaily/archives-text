# FALL QUARTER CINDER MEETS START TODAY
## Distance Events Will Be Run At Full Length For First Time 
### 
What is expected to be the first
real test this quarter of both frosh
and varsity trackmen's ability in
running distance events is slated for
this afternoon when Assistant Coach
Bill Ellinpton has scheduled the
autumn's first full-distance track
meet.
Competition in the various events
will begin promptly at 4:15 o'clock,
the coach said.
Due to the fact that several mem
bers oi both squads were expected
to leave for Thanksgiving vacation
trips, no complete line-up was avail
able yesterday afternoon.
Races lengthened for the first time
this quarter include the two-mile,
one-mile, 880-yard, and 220-yard
hurdle events. In addition, there will
be the usual sprint and field compe
tition.
