# PAN-HELLENIC REVISES DECISION AGAINST THETAS TO BENEFIT NEW WOMEN
## New Interpretation Allows Thetas To Guarantee Spring Quarter Bids At Regular Bidding Time; New Women May Express Preference 
### 
IN justice to the new women and in the interest of the morale of Itohle,"
revised interpretation of the Pan-Hellenic decision against Kappa Alpha
Theta for the illegal bidding of Veva Jane Haehl, was adopted by a
special meeting of the ioint committee, held Sunday morning at the re
quest of Dean Mary Yost. The new interpretation, which was ratified
unanimously by Pan-Hellenic yesterday, allows the Theta house to guar
antee spring quarter bids, and gives new women the right to express

their preference to that house.
On the night of winter quarter
bidding the regular lawyer will re
ceive from Kappa Alpha Theta the
names of those women whom they
guarantee to bid on the spring
quarter bidding date, and from the
new women, statement of their
preference for Theta. The names of
those women who appear on the
Theta list and who have expressed
their perference for that sorority
will be published the following
morning.
Request for the committee meet
ing was made by Dean Yost on
grounds that conditions in Roble
Hall necessitated some revised in
terpretation of the penalty. Com
plete and unprecedented unrest and
indecision among the new women
was the reason for this action, ac
cording to Mcta Jury, who present
ed the committee report.
