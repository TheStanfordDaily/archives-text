## Rockne, Jones, Hawley, Wade, Wilce, Hanley, Loom As New Coach HANDY DRAFTS REGRET 
### 
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 25. (/P).â€”
Clarence "Nibs" Price, who resigned
last night as head football coach at
the University of California, will ac
cept the post of basketball coach for
the Blue and Gold if a "satisfactory"
offer is made him, he said today.
Campus athletic organizations to
day set themselves to the task of
finding a successor for Price as head
football mentor. Captain Carl Handy
called the senior football players to
gether at the Theta Delta Chi fra
ternity at noon "to make construc
tive suggestions" to the Athletic
Council, which has been instructed
to recommend the prospective new
coaches.
The resolution, signed by Ted
Beckett, Russ Avery, Captain Carl
Handy, Frank Medanich and Herman
Eickmeyer, all Varsity men, follows:
"We always have had the fullest
faith and confidence in the ability of
"Nibs" Price as head football coach
at the University. We regret his res
ignation because of the fact that we
believe that this season's results were
not due to his lack of ability as a
coach, but to factors over which he
had no control. His fine spirit of
sportsmanship and loyalty to the
team will always be cherished and
remembered by the men who have
played and fought for him."
The Athletic Council was also sum
moned to meet at noon by Chairman
Joseph Hickingbotham, varsity full
back. Campus reports were circu
lated that three nationally known
coaches, Tad Jones, former Yale
mentor, Jess Hawley, who retired
from the Dartmouth coaching job
last year for business reasons, and
Dr. J. W. Wilce, formerly Ohio State
coach, had been approached by Cali
fornia alumni.
Other names repeatedly connected
with the job included Knute Rockne
of Notre Dame, Bob Zuppke of Illi
nois, Wallace Wade of Alabama, Dick
Hanley of Northwestern and W. A.
Alexander of Georgia Tech.
