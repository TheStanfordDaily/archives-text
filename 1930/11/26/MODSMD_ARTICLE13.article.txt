# BOARD CHOSEN TO AID A.S.S.U. CONCERT PLANS
## Indian Symbol To Replace 'Cardinal;' Considered More Appropriate 
### 
In order to give the A.S.S.U. Con
cert Series additional prestige off
the campus, and the benefit of ex
perienced advice in its management,
an A.S.S.U. Concert Series Advisory
Committee was authorized at the reg
ular weekly meeting of the Execu
tive Committee of the associated stu
dents last night.
Warren D. Allen, Alfred Masters,
Professor George J. Pierce, Mrs. J.
W. Mitchell, as representative of the
Peninsula Musical Association, John
E. McDowell, the student manager,
the concert series manager, and the
two assistant concert series managers
have been asked to serve on the com
mittee. An invitation will also be
extended a member of the Palo Alto
Parent-Teachers Association.
This body will fill a similar place
in concert series activities to that of
the Dramatic Council in campus dra
matic undertakings, Carl McDowell,
concert series manager, explained. It
is to be simply an advisory board
with no further authority.
To give official sanction to a long
popularly accepted idea, a resolution
adopting the Indian as the symbol
of Stanford was passed by the Ex
ecutive Committee. It was felt that
the use of "Cards" and '"Cardinals"
was not symbolical of Stanford spirit
as that of "Indians."
The text of the resolution follows:
Indian Symbol
"Whereas the Indian has long been
unofficially recognized as the symbol
of Stanford and its spirit; and where
as there has never been any official
designation of a Stanford symbol;
be it hereby resolved that the Execu
tive Committee of the associated
students adopt the Indian as the sym
bol of Stanford."
The acceptance of the Indian as
the Stanford emblem is subsequent
to the recent adoption of the Indian
War Drum and Chant by the A.S.S.U.
"Scalpel's," the name of the sopho
more honorary society to which the
guardianship of the drum has been
given, also relates to the Indian sym
bol.
