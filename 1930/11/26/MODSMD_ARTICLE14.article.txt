# JOURNALISTIC GROUP PLACES CHAPTER IN POSITION OF HONOR
## 
### 
With a ranking of ninth among 43
chapters, Stanford's chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, professional jour
nalistic fraternity, was for the first
time placed among the 10 honor
groups of the organization at its
sixteenth convention at Columbus,
Ohio, last week.
This ranking was based on the
journalistic activities of the chap
ter, the professional standing of its
alumni, and the chapter efficiency,
according to Frank Whiteley, Stan
ford delegate to the convention. The
University of Illinois chapter was
ranked first and awarded the F. W.
Beckman efficiency cup.
Among the national officers elect
ed for the coming year was Fred W.
Specrs, editor of The Daily in 1927-
28, who was named by the conven
tion for a place on the Sigma Delta
Chi executive council. Bristow
Adams, Stanford graduate and head
of the journalism department at
Cornell, was elected to the execu
tive council along with Speers.
