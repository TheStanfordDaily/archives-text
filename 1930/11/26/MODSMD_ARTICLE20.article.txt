# YOST EXPLAINS RECENT ACTION IN THETA CASE
## Revised Interpretation To Protect New Women And Offenders 
### 
"It was in order to protect Kappa
| Alpha Theta and the new women
i who will pledge Theta in the spring
1 from the suspicion of secret bidding,
that the Pan-Hellenic joint commit
tee revised its interpretation of the
decision it rendered last week," de
clared Dean Mary Yost to the new
i women of Roblc Hall at a meeting
called last night for the explanation.
"Had the decision held as it was
first passed, it would have been in
evitable that those girls who, at the
winter quarter bidding time, went
'undecided' and who received Theta
bids spring quarter would be open
to suspicion of having had secret un
derstandings with the sorority be
: forehand. This suspicion, ihc: newly
pledged women would be powerless
to combat; and the house would like
wise be absolutely unable to prove
its innocence in the matter.
To Help New Women
"That new women should remain
'undecided' in the hall until spring
quarter without any assurance of a
Theta bid was considered highly un
desirable by the committee. The in
decision and unrest it would cause
was one of the chief reasons back of
the recent reconsideration. Thus, it
was largely for the benefit of the new
v ornen who would suffer from the
original penalty, and who are in no
way to blame, that the reinterpreta
tion was made."
While Kappa Alpha Theta will be
bound to bid those girls on their list
who express a Theta preference, the
women whose names are published
on that list will not be legally bound
to accept the bid when it is given on
, the spring bidding date. There will
be, however, a moral, if not legal,
obligation to accept the bid, accord
ing to Dean Yost.
Eligibility Interpreted
Women who are guaranteed Theta
bids and who express a preference
for that sorority will not be eligible
to be rushed by other houses until
1 after the spring quarter bidding.date,
according to the new interpretation.
Those, however, who go "undecided"
will be eligible to be rushed by any
house except Kappa Alpha Theta
I twenty-four hours after winter quar
i ter bidding.
