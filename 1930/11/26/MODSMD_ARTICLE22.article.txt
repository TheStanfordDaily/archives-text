# IOWA CO-EDS BUILD TOM THUMB COURSE
## 
### 
lOWA CITY, lowa, Nov. 25. (/!>)â€”
Co-eds at lowa University here
wanted a Tom Thumb golf course,
so they built one themselves.
They did the designing! mixed the
concrete, wheeled it in wheel-bar
rows, and laid it down on th course
to be fashioned into "hazards."
Students in the department of
physical education did the work.
Each student submitted a design for
the 18 holes, and the best features
of all designs went into the final
plan.
Even the carpentry was done
without the aid of masculinity.
The course is now a part of the
women's athletic field at the uni
versity and classes meet regularly
on it for instruction in putting.
