BERKELEY, Nov. 24.—(PIP)—So
ber in tone was the editorial appear
ing this morning in The Daily Cali
fornian, the first written by Arthur
M. Arlctt since his reinstatement last
night as editor of the Berkeley stu
dent newspaper.
"I am in sympathy with 'Nibs'
Price," Arlett declared, "but perhaps
it was the best thing for all con
cerned. The investigation into the
situation on the campus is by no
means finished.
"There is a great deal to be accom
plished. If it is due to be done right,
it must be done in unison. And, to
that end, the executive committee
and The Californian have seen fit to
make whatever concessions were
necessary in the interests of student
government and the university at
large."
Arlett was discharged by the stu
dent executive committee on last
Wednesday for conducting a vigor
ous editorial campaign against the
California football season and pro
fessionalism of athletes. The bel
licose editor was reinstated by a spe
cial meeting of the committee last
night Hollowing a compromise in
which Arlett agreed to run his edi
torials under the slogan that the
column expressed the opinions of the
writer, and not of the student gov
ernment.
