# CURDS SET TO THWART HOPES OF DARTMOUTH
## Victory Over Green Team Would Put Redshirts In Limelight BATTLE FOR PRESTIGE 
### Jack Jernegan 
Standing on the threshold of its
last game of the 1930 season, the
Stanford football team is faced with
the problem of defeating a hitherto
unbeaten Dartmouth aggregation
next Saturday afternoon in the
Stanford Stadium.
Victory in this tilt will go a long
way to restore the prestige lost in
the U.S.C. misfortune, part of which
prestige has already been regained
by victories over California and
Washington. If the Cards can turn
back the Green invasion decisively
they will gain a considerable meas
ure of national consideration, since
the Hanover Indians are the only
undefeated eleven Ml in the East,
although they have been tied once.
First Practice
With the invaders ensconced in
the Stadium this afternoon, only a
couple of hundred yards away, the
Redshirts went through their first
practice since the Big Game behind
the practice field fence.
Coach Pop Warner directed a
light session lasting an hour and a
half, which consisted mainly of sig
nal drill, some setting-up exercises
and running around being added to
round out the afternoon.
Rate Even
On past performances the Big
Green team and the Big Red ma
chine probably rate about even in
view of the fact that Stanford has
shown considerable improvement
since its lie with Minnesota and de
feat by U.S.C.
The Dartmouth eleven boasts a
strong, heavy line on which Coach
Canncll relies to bring home the
bacon, and this forward wall de
serves a slight edge over the Card
inal linemen, despite the showing of
these latter against, California.
Backfield Edge
In the backfield Warner's men
have an advantage in weight and
in ability, particularly now that
they have at last gotten the intri
cate Warner plays down to a point,
where they are almost automatic.
However, a strong line is more im
portant than a strong backfield, and
if Dartmouth can gain a real superi
ority in the line things will look
bad for the boys from the Farm.
One big factor favoring the Red
shirts is the warm California cli
mate. If Saturday is a really warm
day such as has been common this
fall, the New Hampshire boys may
wilt rather badly, and in that case
a large score for Stanford would not.

VOLCANIC ERUPTION
lIILO, Hawaii, Nov. 25. </\'i
Halcmaumau, the crater of Kilauea
volcano, showed no sign of dimin
ishing today. The volcano started
erupting last Wednesday.
Standing on the threshold of its
last game of the 1930 season, the
Stanford football team is faced with
the problem of defeating a hitherto
unbeaten Dartmouth aggregation
next Saturday afternoon in the
Stanford Stadium.
Victory in this tilt will go a long
way to restore the prestige lost in
the U.S.C. misfortune, part of which
prestige has already been regained
by victories over California and
Washington. If the Cards can turn
back the Green invasion decisively
they will gain a considerable meas
ure of national consideration, since
the Hanover Indians are the only
undefeated eleven Ml in the East,
although they have been tied once.
First Practice
With the invaders ensconced in
the Stadium this afternoon, only a
couple of hundred yards away, the
Redshirts went through their first
practice since the Big Game behind
the practice field fence.
Coach Pop Warner directed a
light session lasting an hour and a
half, which consisted mainly of sig
nal drill, some setting-up exercises
and running around being added to
round out the afternoon.
Rate Even
On past performances the Big
Green team and the Big Red ma
chine probably rate about even in
view of the fact that Stanford has
shown considerable improvement
since its lie with Minnesota and de
feat by U.S.C.
The Dartmouth eleven boasts a
strong, heavy line on which Coach
Canncll relies to bring home the
bacon, and this forward wall de
serves a slight edge over the Card
inal linemen, despite the showing of
these latter against, California.
Backfield Edge
In the backfield Warner's men
have an advantage in weight and
in ability, particularly now that
they have at last gotten the intri
cate Warner plays down to a point,
where they are almost automatic.
However, a strong line is more im
portant than a strong backfield, and
if Dartmouth can gain a real superi
ority in the line things will look
bad for the boys from the Farm.
