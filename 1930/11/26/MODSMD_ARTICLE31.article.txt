# SNUBBING AND REPERCUSSION
## 
### 
I lie California Executive Committee mot excited the other night
;md did two things: 1. Accepted the resignation of Clarence "Xihs"
I'rice as coach ot the football and basketball teams: 2. Reinstated
\rthur .M. Arlett as editor of The Daily Californuin.
(, oncerning "Xihs" I'rice's resignation. The I ).\n.v can onlv offer
condolences to the California coach.
< )n the action of the committee in rescinding its earlier decision
ousting Arlett as the editor ol the student newspaper, The Daily
believes it was the only solution to a problem which would have
greatl\ embarrassed student gov ernment at the I'niversity of Cali
fornia.
I he dismissal of Arlett came as an example of a governing
council feeling it had been snubbed because the editor refused to
abide by its dictatorship. 'I he California Executive Committee failed
to recognize the fact that Vrlett. as editor of the CalifonTmn, had a
perlcct right to express the opinion he thought was paramount in
students' thoughts, where the committee failed was in endeavoring
to assume too much authority and it came out second best: to assuage
its feelings it dismissed Arlett.
The situation at the I'niversity of California is clearing and
soon there may he perfect harmony and accord on the Herkelev
campus. However, any more spectacles of revengeful student gov
ernment as that at California will mean ultimately the downfall of
student control and the. resumption of faculty administration.
