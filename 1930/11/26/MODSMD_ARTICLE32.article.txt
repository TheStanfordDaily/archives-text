# A 						SCRAP OF PAPER
## 
### 
I lie lolly purposes ot the I'an-1 lellenic committee which revised
its interpretation of the Theta penalty so as to make it little more
than a punishment in name, were explained last night to the new
women by Dean Alary Yost. That said purposes were loftv. is con
ceded. I hat they will he accomplished, is doubtful. That I'an I lel
lenic is strong enough to express a sentiment contrary to that of the
administration is as yet unproven.
The just piinishment-of an inexcusable blunder on the part of
Kappa Alpha I'heta was virtually revoked after the decisionâ€”de
scribed as "final" by members of the committee had been handed
down to I 'an-1 lellenic and to the offending house. At the request
of Dean Yost, "university representative." a further meeting of the
committee was called for "reinterpretation" of the penalty. The
result was a revised decision which was railroaded through I'an-
I lellenic. The motion amounted to litile more than an administration
recommendation.
The power of I'an-1 lellenic exists onlv on the paper where is
printed the mythical bidding contract.
