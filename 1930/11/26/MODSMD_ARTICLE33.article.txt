# ONE DOLLAR

### 
In this year of economic depression and unemployment the
\merican Ked Cross is making its annual appeal for funds. Poverty
and suliering requiring aid arc making far greater demands on lin
ked Cross now than is generally the case.
It is in a year like the present one that the Ked Cross needs every
ccni of money obtainable to care for the unfortunate victims of the
business and industrial crash.
Stanford stindents gave more than one thousand dollars in the
autumn quarter drive last year. Hut to date only a little more than
half ot this amount has been contributed to the I'MO Ked Cross fund.
I he I Diversity's Ked Cross drive comes to an end tonight. Stan
lord gave liberally in 192''. Ihe money is more vitally needed now
than then. One dollar from every student will give Stanford a Red
( ross contribution far more representative of campus generositv
than the S3OO total so far raised.
I low about it ? Just a dollar apiece.
