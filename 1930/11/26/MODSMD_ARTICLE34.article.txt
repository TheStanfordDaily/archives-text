# THE 						NEW "PHI BETE" CLASS
## 
### 
In another column of this morning's D.mi.v will be found a list
of 2S students who will he awarded the golden key of I'hi I let a
Kappa in recognition of their scholastic attainments.
Just whether a "I'hi Kete" key does mark its owner as mentally
superior to the student who has received no such recognition is an
age old question, and probably will remain a subject for debate as
long as the present grading system exists.
Although I 'hi Beta Kappa is often the target of jests, member
ship in that body is a real achievement. The key can only l>e earned
through a combination of hard work, mental aptness, and determina
tion; though, perhaps in varying proportions for different indi
viduals. After all. it's the result's that count.
