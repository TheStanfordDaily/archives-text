SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA—A( the Curran
Theatre.
The program of last Sunday's con
cert was extremely varied in style,
ranging from the classical First
Symphony of Beethoven to the mod
ern "Sinfonietta" of Goosens. Be
tween these two extremes were
Schumann's piano Concerto and the
Prelude and "Liebestod" from Wag
ner's "Tristran and Isolde." Martha
Baird played the extremely difficult
concerto in fine style. The Goosens
number with its dissonance was a
most interesting contrast to the rest
(if the program.
Next Sunday's popular program
will include a Haydn Symphony and
a Bach Brandenburg Concerto, as
well as shorter numbers by Beetho
ven, Saint Saens, and Arne. it is
at) unusually serious program for a
popular concert. —N. B.
Till: APPLE CART—At the (icaiy
Theatre, San Francisco.
Amidst a remarkable futuristic
setting, the latest George Bernard
Shaw play demonstrates the British
playwright has not lost his ability
to present clever situations, subtle
satire, and scintillating lines.
The play, a political extravaganza
showing how big business will con
trol government of the future
through dupes in the cabinet, was
well cast; Alan Mowbray, as the
shrewd King Magnus, easily carried
off honors. Doris Lloyd, who shared
the lead with Mowbray, was disan
pointing, but Nellie Strong as Ar
manda, the postmistress, more than
made up fQr it.
The presentation of Shaw's piece
was excellently accomplished. The
general tone of the play sat well
with the audience and everyone was
kept in a pleasurable mood from the
time the curtain rose to the final
overture." H.

112 MIDSUMMER NIGHT. By Carl Wil
hclmson. Farrar & Rinehart,
N.Y. I«) 30. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
The Finnish midsummernight
conies once a year, and few can
escape the magic of its spell. Even
j Otto, who had left the Maki farm
, when a child, and become hardened
with twenty years of a sailor's life,
realizes that it is his home and that
! he loves Aino—who loves Esko.
The dreamy quality of the title
influences the book itself. There arc
poignant bits in it, when Otto loses
Aino, when Grandfather Pers dies
1 believing in something he could not
j prove. A beautiful book excellently
written by a Stanford graduate, it
gives a glimpse at a life other than
ours, in which time advances slowly,
and custom keeps Finland simple
and calmly sufficient unto itself.
