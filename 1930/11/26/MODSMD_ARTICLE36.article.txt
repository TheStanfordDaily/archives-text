# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
By ten o'clock, this morning,
classes will have dwindled away
to practically nothing at all.
You can then classify the' friends
you see on Quad as cither "A"
students or probable flunkees.
The ones in between don't
worry, and have gone home to
turkey.
The New Hampshire hills are well
represented, at Dartmouth, if size j
has anything to do with power. The
football squad descended upon the
campus yeslerda yafternoon, weigh
ing us down with wondering what
they'll do to the scoreboard—out
weighing the team with pounds to
be worried about. Too bad they had
to leave their train at Oakland—if
they* only could have managed to
ride to the Paly station, so we could
have rallied round to cheer! We're
supposed to have a campus flower
committee, aren't we? Cabbages has
a standing order with a local vege
table vendor ....
It may be noticed that the Dart- |

I mouth team left their much-adver
tised snowshoes at home. We'll have
to see Jupiter Pluvius about the
rain. Sunny weather like this can't
last—the coldest season in years is
apt to start at any time. And yet, a
Stanford publication can't be wrong.
We're coming to realize what fun
; a vacation spent on the campus
i might develop into, with the right
j people around. Of course, there'll
be two football teams, but they'll be
pretty busy till Saturday, girls. And
after that they'll betired ....
Seriously, though, no less
than three campus marriages
have taken plasc as a result of
during llie holidays last fall,
six people's staying at school
There's always a chance! Not
everyone stays here to study.
Cabbages waxes enthusiastic with
the thought of three days of sleep
less celebration. Suit yourselves on
' the vegetable question for Thanks
giving dinner. We'll take cauliflower,
I for ours.
