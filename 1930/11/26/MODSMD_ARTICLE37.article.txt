# SEMI-FINAL PLACES IN MOOT TOURNEYS REMAIN UNDECIDED
## 
### 
The Law School's Moot Court i
tournament has been concluded for j
this quarter, with but two of the '
four semi-final positions decided. !
Louis Mercado and Alfred Frazier j
have yet to meet Hugh Lindsey and
Leonard A villa for one of these va- j
cancies, and W. L. Skanchy and ,
Charles Henderson must argue I
against Harry Dudley and J. R. i
Arkush for the other. The two teams !
already in the semi-final position are
Cranston and Hume, and Beene and !
Jennings.
All of the remaining sessions ex- I
cept the finals will be held during ,
(he winter quarter, and the final '
contest will be argued in the spring j
quarter, probably before a judge of
the California Supreme Court.
