Chester Rowell, regent of the Uni
versity of California and columnist,
states that ignorance is no discredit
to a pupil but is a disgrace to a
teacher.
Now if Rowell could only convince
college professors that he is right,
perhaps several thousand students
would not leave American universi
ties yearly "by request."
i A study just completed at Wil
lamette College reveals that every
day in college is worth $125. One
realizes of course that wisdom is
more valuable than anything in the
j world: and yet one often feels that
at $125 a day students could afford
to cut several days in a quarter.
At Ohio Wesleyan College the
English department is the largest,
while economics is second. At most
universities, however, economics is
1 by far the largest department.
This is because economics
brings to (he mind of the aver
i age freshman visions of splendid
I offices, high-powered execu
tives, 75-cent cigars, and good
looking secretaries.
i Then, on the other hand, English
implies grammar and spelling to the
1 l'rosh; political science recalls civics;
I history means dates, but economics
, brings visions o fthat sordid root of
all evil, money.
Energetic students at the Uni
versity of Colorado have organ
ized an insurance company
which insures one against being
called upon in class. If one is
asked to recite after being in
sured. the company must pay a
siAi depending on the amount
of the policy.
The University of Columbia daily
! advocates having lectures presented
in written form instead of the pres
l ent system.
If this proposal were ever put into
effect, colleges would be supplanted
I by correspondence schools. If the
I personality of Ihe professor is re-j
moved, one migh as well change the

I name of institutions of higher learn
' ing from colleges to libraries.
What is more, without profes
sors, co-eds would have nothing
j to apple-polish, and with noth
ing to do in college, co-eds
would fail to register. And after
all California and U.C.L.A.
! would be drab sort of places
without their co-eds. .
