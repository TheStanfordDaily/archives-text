# SIDELINE SLANTS
## A 						SAD SATURDAY? 
### 
In yesterday morning's Daily, Pop
iVarner predicted a tough afternoon
or the well-known 1930 edition of
he Big Red Machine when it meets
he Green Wave of Dartmouth. And
.vc are apt to agree with him, not
hat it makes any particular dif
'erence.
During the first half of the pre
. ioi>s Saturday's spectacle, Califor
nia made yards in two line plays.
Sever in all past history can the
nesent generation recall a time
vhen a Cardinal forward wall
ooked weaker than it did for the
inal 2(i minutes of those first
icrioris.
Gannell's strongest point is the
Dartmouth lino. Averaging around
pounds, that unil is responsible
or the ungodly scores credited to
he Green in its Eastern activities.
\nd the Cardinal's weakest link is
hat forward wall.
While every sports writer or self
tyled sports writer on a college
>aper suffers from a violent form
if astigmatism where his Alma
ilater's outfit is concerned, we think
hat the Cards can out charge this
vcw Hampshire aggregation if they
( t their minds lo it.
Take the ends, for instance. All
eason long we have harped on Phil
\eill and what a sweet end he is.
\nd Bill Doub—now there is a real
ighter, if there ever was one. The
übstitutes -Colvin, Albertson, Bush,
Vittenau, et at—they are capable,
00. If mad enough, that crew will
poil anything thrown at, around,
■r near them.
Tackles? Captain Tandy we will
kip over because it is not fair to
iay to consider him capable of
daying a full game. Bogue — he
lutuld he capable of turning in one
cal exhibition, the kind of raving,
earing game he is capable of, he
ore he leaves. Dartmouth is his last
banco. 'Ehrhorn. call him what you
vill. is a tough boy who is just
bout sure of himself at last. George
ircy, too, picked up plenty of ex
>erience last Saturday.
At guard, we have six nice boys
i Bardin, Hulen, Hand, Hunt, Hei
er, and Dawson. Bardin and Hulen
avevbeen starting the tough games,
nd are playing their last clash for
he Cards this week-end. Heiser has
een a disappointment to date, and
11 the more so because we feel that
e might, make us forget Post or
iobesky. Perhaps that is too much
!: a handicap for Pete, but what
ripened to him when he should
Tve taken care of Avery?
Hunt has coine along nicely for
is first season as varsity guard,
hil<' 3* n<l and Dawson have not
een in many of the larger contests,
ix men—Bardin and Ileiser have
een out at times due to injuries,
lulcn has come along with a rush,
Unit and Hand too have improved,
hiic Dawson is as steady as a rock
n defense—what sort of a game
ill they play against Dartmouth?
We hate to pick on the center
osition. Good old Perry has taken
i much punishment in there that
e aches all over from Saturday
ntil Thursday, and then it is al
lost fame time again. Ingagi will
lay opposite the Dartmouth cap
lin, Andres, to make his chores a
ttie more interesting. Were Albert
n 0.k., things would be brighter,
ut Bill Marks has done better than
lyone had hoped he would, and
ext year he will be right up there
ith the best of them.
To summarize: The ends arc
rong, with plenty of capable re
•rves. Potentially powerful, the
>ckles will make or break Stanford
aturday, for here it is that Canncll
ill concentrate his fire. As we see
. the best feature of the guards is
nit there are plenty of them, all
>ou( on the same level. If it were
»t for Hillman's work in hacking
l> the line, the center trio would
ok sadly inefficient. Do we hear a
isscnting vote? We thought so.
Out here on the Western Slooe
e are apt to dismiss Eastern teams
ith a wave of the hand and a
toh-pooh. Too many wins have
slocated our sense of values, and

it would be tough if the Stanford
chin should take the jolt which
would restore a fairer view. Stick
ing the old beezer out only offers a
better target, don't you know!
