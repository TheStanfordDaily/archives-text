# Will the Green Indians Follow in the Footsteps of The Kay-dets and "Go West" in Military Style?
## 
### 
Dartmouth is following in Army's
1929 footsteps and in line with Hor
ace Greeley's one-time advice is ,
"Going West." The same suggestion
was taken at its war value by the
Kay-dets, for they "Went West" in
' a slightly more figurative manner.
Perhaps, in the case of Dartmouth, it
will be different, but I don't think J
so after seeing Coach Jackson Can
nell's men in action against Vale
last month.
But when the Green Indians from
the Hanover Hills of New Hamp
' shire meet the Red Indians of Palo
! Alto, California, almost anything can
happen (including "Pop, goes the
Warner!")
Dartmouth couldn't beat Yale, that
was beaten by Georgia, that was
beaten by Tulane, that was beaten
by Northwestern! that beat Minne

' sota, that tied Stanford—if that
means anything to you in trying to
decide which team is the better, the
Cardinals or the Greens. Dartmouth
was, unless I am badly mistaken,
the last Eastern team to defeat a
far-Western outfit, and this hap
pened in 1920 when Fat Spears took
his boys out to Seattle to trim
Washington about 28 to 7.
Cannell has no Sonnenbergs,
Youngstroms, or Cunninghams in
his line this year, but he has a sweet
end in Yudicky, and a fine pair of
running backs in Morton and Mc-
Call. Also, one of his quarterbacks,
Robert E. Lee, Jr., is a direct de
scendant of the Confederate Gen
eral of that name, and in Shep Wolf,
the forward passing halfback from
Brooklyn, he has a young man who
carves grotesque heads in wood
when there is nothing else to do.
