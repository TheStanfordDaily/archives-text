# SLONAKER SUBMITS DATA ON EFFECTS OF PROTEIN DIETS
## Results Of Experiments On Animals Revealed By Professor 
### 
Dr. J. R. Slonaker, professor of
physiology, has submitted for pub
lication the first of a group of papers
pertaining to a series of experiments
he has been conducting since March
1127.
The experiments have been on the
subject of the effect of different per
cents of protein in the diet on
growth, spontaneous activity, food
consumption, reproduction length of
the reproductive period, offspring,
life span, and cause of death in the
albino rat throughout several gen
erations.
The results of the investigations
pre to be described in several arti
cles on the various phases of the
effect of protein.
As the#remainder of the articles
deal with the succeeding genera
tions, which are still alive, they will
not, be completed for some time.
These experiments are the most
thorough that have been made by
physiologists, and should be instru
mental in settling the controversy
regarding the proper amount of pro
tein that should be included in the
diet.
Dr. Slonaker is experimenting
with five groups of rats, each of
which originally consisted of 18
pairs. Each group is being fed food
containing a different percentage of
protein: 10 per cent, 14 per cent. 22
per cent, and 26 per cent, respective
ly. He expects 1o continue the work
for two or three years, in order to
establish more definite facts than
have been decided so far.
