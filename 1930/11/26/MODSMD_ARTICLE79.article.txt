# G.E. FELLOWSHIPS FOR RESEARCH WORK OPEN TO STUDENTS
## 
### 
Annual fellowships in physical
research, electricity, and physical
chemistry are announced by the
General Electric Company in a re
cent bulletin received by the Physics
department.
These fellowships are presented
annually to students in various col
leges in order to encourage research
work. A sum of $500 is the amount
given. This sum can be enlarged if
the work of any individual war
rants it.
In the past few years several
Stanford students have been for
tunate enough to receive the fellow
ships. Last year Edward Evans, of
Stanford, was one of the winners.
The fellowships provide for re
search work in any college that the
individual selects. No restrictions
are made as to location as far as
selection goes and any number can
be taken from one locality. Further
information can be had from the
Physics department.
