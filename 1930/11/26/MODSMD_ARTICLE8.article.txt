# Greenclad Warriors Here; Temperature Furnishes Surprise
## Coach Jack Cannell Figures Warm Weather No Threat To Dartmouth Chances; Team Works Out in Stadium Behind Closed Gates INVADERS TO HAVE FULL STRENGTH ON FIELD 
### 
Very much surprised at the warm sunshine, green trees, and flowers,
a husky hand of football players from the snow-covered White Mountains
of New Hampshire arrived on the campus yesterday afternoon to give the
place the once over injircparation for the gridiron struggle with Stanford's
Cardinal gridmcn here Saturday.
Coach Jack Cannell's Dartmouth boys stretched their legs on the stadium
turf for a half hour while the newspaper photographers took some shots,

'v and then took a .short workout bc
-1 hind closed doors, an unexpected ma
neuver, since Cannell has previously
, had no secret prace at all this year.
Weather Threat
1 ; Although Cannell declared that
1 the warm weather would not bother
, his men, the general opinion of play
-1 ers and correspondents who accom
i panied the squad was that the heat
would have a bad effect upon the
' | team. After running around for a
few minutes in the stadium yesterday
some of the players looked pretty
' hot and tired and most of them were
; rather stiff after their long train
. , trip.
, ! While some of the Hanover boys
â€¢ I declared that they lost a lot of pep
on their journey west, others said
that they felt O.K. and got a lot of
i fun out of the trip.
Full Strength
The squad is staying at the Benja
i min Franklin Hotel in San Mateo,
but will come down to the campus
j every day for a workout in the sta
! dium.
Dartmouth will have its full
l j strength on the field Saturday, since
, the men who have been injured are
. | either back in shape or have been
l|out for so long that they are no
: longer considered part of the team.
Fine Back
Len Clark, said to be the finest
interfering back on the squad, is
, | back in shape after a lengthy ab
, j sence and may start against the
Cards. He ran interference for the
great "Special Delivery" Marsters
| last year, Having a lot to do with the
wonderful record that high scoring
back ran up.
If Clark plays he will displace right
halfback '"Wild Bill" McCal! who is
regarded as the most dangerous ball
| carrier on the team. McCall is hev
i aided as a shifty runner, packing
| most of the Dartmouth offensive
power.
J . Few Substitutes
j The Big Green Indian team may
| be called an "iron man" aggregation,
| since it uses very few substitutes.
Paul Crehan, tackle, Gay Bromberg,
;guard, Bill Moilon, quarter, and Shop
Wolff, Halfback, have played every
minute of every major game this
season, while Captain Hal Andres,
I center, has played all of every tilt
I except the Cornell clash.
Stan Yudicky, rated the best end
! in the East, who has been out of the
i game with an injured knee for five
| weeks, is definitely out of the game
'Saturday, Cannell said yesterday. He
| has broken training and is not con
| sidered a possibility. Forrest Branch
j is the man who will replace him.
