I Because of danger to the crowds
! and cars in the parking areas about
the stadium, planes have been pro
! hibited from using the Palo Alto
aviation field on the day of the Dart
-1 mouth game. This statement was
made by A. P. Mantz, field manager
i of the airport.
' The regulation was introduced at
j the request of University officials
j shortly before the U.S.C. game and
will remain, in effect during all the
larger games played in the stadium
hereafter.
According to Mantz, letters have
been sent to all nearby operators of
i commercial planes informing them
of the new ruling. It was impossible
to notify the owners of private
planes, Mantz said, and those planes
' landing on the field during the re
stricted days will be forced to re
