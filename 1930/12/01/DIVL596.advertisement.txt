(Z~Tyy MEANS of a new vacuum tube called a low-grid-current
cJ-J Pliotron tube, astronomers can gather the facts of stellar news
with greater speed and accuracy. In conjunction with a photoelectric
tube, it will help render information on the amount of light radia
tion and position of stars centuries of light years away. It is further
applicable to such laboratory us(*s as demand the most delicate
measurement of electric current.
So sensitive is this tube, that it can measure 0.000,000,000,000,000,01
of an ampere, or, one-hundredth of a millionth of a billionth of an
ampere. This amount of current, compared with that of a 50-watt
incandescent lamp, is as two drops of water compared with the entire
volume of water spilled over Niagara Falls in a year.
| General Electric leadership in the development of vacuum tubes has
largely been maintained by college-trained men, just as collwe-trained
men are largely irsponsible for the impressive progress made by General
Electric in other Jields of research and engineering.
