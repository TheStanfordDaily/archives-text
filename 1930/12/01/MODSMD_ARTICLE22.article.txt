# Big Green Teams In Draw Daily Triumphs Over Chaparral, 6 To 6 Gould Fools Self On Play
## 
### 
In a soul-stirring battle that had
the crowd on its collective foot
throughout the entire seven minutes
of play, the football teams of the
Chaparral and the Daily fought to
a 6-6 deadlock in the main event of
Saturday's sports program.
After the preliminary contest be
tween the Dartmouth and Stanford
varsities had been half finished, the
Chappies and the Dailyites took the
field by surprise and the crowd by
storm.
An attempt by Captain Gould of
the Chappies to abscond with the
referee's coin was thwarted by the
Rally Committee, and Gould almost
kicked off.
Center Rush Whiteley of the
journalists recovered the alleged
kick-off and after Bauer had been
halted on a reverse, the Daily scored
on a "fan" pass from Friendlich to
Kullmann, the latter's interference
pausing long enough to "fan" the
safety man with clubs and enable
Lithe Lennie to romp goalward.

| "Goteh-Ear" Lorton returned the
Daily's following kick-off thirty
I yards, but stopped momentarily
■ when Ik- thought hn saw somebody
1 be knew in the stands. He and his
disappointment were buried under
| a horde of Daily tacklers.
After a sextuple reverse had been
stopped for no gain, the Chappies
I pulled the hidden ball play with
i such success that Captain Gould
thought, the Daily had it, and did
i not discover that it was nestling in
hi* own arms until he was thrown
for a loss.
j The Chaparral then scored on the
| famous Dannemora line shift with
| "Machine Gun Butch" Anthony
packing the prolate spheriod across.
The Chappies later crossed the
I goal line again on a variation of the
Dead Soldiers' March, but the score
was annulled under Section 27 of
the State Penal Code.
Joe Thompson, announcing over
the public address system, won an
earned decision over the Olympic
