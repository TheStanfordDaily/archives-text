# MINERS BEGIN COAL STRIKE IN SCOTLAND
## Officials Fear Strike May Spread To Workers In English Fields 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 30 (/P). A strike
of 92,000 men in the coal fields of
Scotland began today. Great Britain
as a whole, however, breathed a sigh
of relief as it appeared certain there
would be no general stoppage of
work in the coal fields tomorrow
when the new coal mines law goes
into effect.
Friday the situation appeared as
dark as it could be. The miners'
leaders in a great majority of the
districts as well as the delegate con
ference meeting" in London deci
sively had turned down the plan of
90-hours work per fortnight—the
"spread-over" system—the only al
ternative the owners could propose
to wage-cut when the seven-hour
day becomes compulsory under the
nevV mines act.
Then Friday night the government
intervened sand in telegrams to own
ers and miners- irr aT 1 districts urged
a temporary working agreement un
til further negotiations could be
completed.
The Scottish situation admittedly
is grave but just how grave no one
at present can say. E. Shinwell,
minister of mines, had been work
ing since Friday to bring Scottish
owners and miners into line with the
rest of the country to come to some
arrangement whereby the pits may
be kept open if only on a day-to-day
basis.
Optimists believe the men will be
back at work by tomorrow night.
On the other hand, strikes of these
dimensions obviously contain poten
tialities both for a local upheaval
and for extensions of trouble to
other districts.
