# DRESSED DOLLS WILL BE GIVEN BY Y.W.C.A.
## 
### 
Purchased with a sum from the
Convalescent Home Fun Fund,
turned over to the Y.W.C.A., dolls
with costumes prepared by Stanford
women will be given this Christmas
to little girls confined to the Con
valescent Home.
Five sororities and many Roble
women have volunteered to make
clothes for the dolls, which will total
two dozen in all. Anyone willing to
dress one should communicate with
Mrs. Ben Allen or Lillian Shuck at
the Y.W.C.A. When the dolls arc
ready they will be displayed in the
Y.W.C.A. rooms at the Women's
Clubhouse until December 12.
