### LEN KULLMANN 
With Ihc wizardry which is Warner's, Stanford's newly christened
Indians took a hard-fought struggle from the Green Wave of Dartmouth
College in the Stadium Saturday by a score of 14 to 7. Replete with thrills,
the battle took a red tinge by virtue of the two Cardinal touchdowns
produced in the second and fourth quarters.
Closing the 1930 season with a clean-cut win, eight veterans scintil
lated for the last time as members of a Stanford squad. Harlow Rothert,
Bill Simkins, Bill Clark, Bill Bardin, Ray Hulen, Perry Taylor, Dick Bogue,

and Joe Bush sang their swan song
Saturday, while Bill Laird, Kay Al
bertson, Bill Burke, Phil Winnek,
and Captain Ray Tandy will also bp
among the missing when the next
football season rolls around.
Both teams scored in the second
period. After a close opening ses
sion featured by a punting duel be
tween Rothert and Morton, the In
dians marched 55 yards to a score.
Moffatt returned Morton's punt, to the
Stanford 45-yard line when the sec
ond quarter was two minutes old.
Moffatt 5 yards on a reverse, a pen
alty of 5 yards for offside, and a first
down on the Dartmouth 45 opened
the march.
Hillman and Moffatt moved the

through for a fn*st down on the 20-
yard stripe, Moffatt picked up seven
yards in two tries, and Rothert.
smashed through left tackle for 11
yards and a touchdown after Hill
man had missed a first down by
inches on a third-down plunge.
Dartmouth came back fighting
when Johnson intercepted a pass to
trot to the Cardinal 22-yard marker.
Morton made 11, then six yards, and
the break of the day came for Dart
mouth. Albertson, sent into the
game to replace Taylor, did not
catch Referee Herb Dana's eye until
the Green had come out of their
huddle. Having twelve men on the
field cost the Redshirts half the dis
tance to the goal line, and gave the
invaders a first down with but two
yards to go for a score.

and Shcp Wolff put. the placement,
kick squarely between the bars to
tie the score at 7-7. Shortly after

the half. The third quarter went
scoreless, and the fourth was five
minutes gone before Grey inter
cepted a pass to put the pigskin on
the Redshirt 41.

and Moffatt broke loose for 25 yards
and a first down on Dartmouth's 21-
yard line. Rothert 4 on a spin play,
and Caglieri 17 to a touchdown put
the score up to 13-7. Grey added
the extra point.

drive.
Marked by a fairly even line bat -
tle, the game was won by Stanford's
superiority in the backfield and (he
Redshirts might well have scored
-mother touchdown. By far (he best
battle of the season on Ihe Stanford
schedule, the attendance at the game
was disappointing.
