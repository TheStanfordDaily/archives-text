# ONE WORD MOKE ON PAN-HELLENIC

The wav in w I lid i the recent Kappa Alpha I liela affair was
11::n<111*<I was prool positive <if ilie weakness of I'an 1 lellenic. Ii is
in lie hope<l thai the lesson will not he lost <>n the sorority women o!
the campus. gain from the episode might take form in
a new attitude toward I'an I lellenic, and a reorganization ol that
hodv.
I lie first st<•)> inward a strong inter sorority group is the selection
of strong representatives, and an understanding that the ollice is an
important and permanent one. The frequent substitution of alter
nate delegates makes for instability naturally. I ntil the sororities
t'ome to regard the office of I'an I lellenic representative as a vital
one upon which both the mutual and the individual benefit of the
sorority depends, that body will lack power.
\n elected presidency, rather than a rotative one, is a possible
means of increasing the prestige of I 'an-1 lellenic. In spite of the
fact that it has been turned down once or twice already, the plan has
undeniable advantages which deserve consideration.
