# ONE WORD MOKE ON PAN-HELLENIC
## 
### 
The way in which the recent Kappa Alpha Theta affair was
handled was proof positive of the weakness of Pan-Hellenic. It is
to be hoped that the lesson will not be lost on the sorority women of
the campus. Constructive gain from the episode might take form in
a new attitude toward Pan-Hellenic, and a reorganization of that
body.
The first step toward a strong inter-sorority group is the selection
of strong representatives, and an understanding that the office is an
important and permanent one. The frequent substitution of alter-
nate delegates makes for instability naturally. Until the sororities
come to regard the office of Pan-Hellenic representative as a vital
one upon which both the mutual and the individual benefit of the
sorority depends, that body will lack power.
An elected presidency, rather than a rotative one, is a possible
means of increasing the prestige of Pan-Hellenic. In spite of the
fact that it has been turned down once or twice already, the plan has
undeniable advantages which deserve consideration.
