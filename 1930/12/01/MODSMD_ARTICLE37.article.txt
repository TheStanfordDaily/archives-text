# A 						SATISFACTORY SEASON

\<Â»v\ 1 hat the moleskins are -packed away in mothballs for the
winter, the football minded public can relax from the strain (if a
lough ten weeks' schedule and prepare themselves for nine months
of pleasant post mortems on the grid season just completed.
I 'op Warner's men have turned in the best record since 1 1 >27.
The (iolden Hears, traditional foes for 3fi years, were humbled by
a record breaking score. Likewise Dartmouth, undefeated until Sat
urday, was beaten by the Stanford team. The record is a brilliant
one, except for the single blemish left by Troy.
Since Stanford teams seldom develop top form until late in the
reason, and since Southern ( alifornia is perhaps the strongest op
ponent, would it not be more sensible to schedule the Trojan game
near the end of the season, and not in < )ctober as has been tile
custom.
Any team must be at the peak of perfection to defeat the power
ful eleven coached hv Howard Jones. Stanford never readies that
peak until the middle of November. Iliis should be remembered
when the l'Ml schedule is arranged.
