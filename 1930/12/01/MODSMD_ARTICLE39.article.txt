The generous welcome and kiin 11 v treatment accorded the Dart
mouth squad by San b'rancisco newspapers during the past week
was in decided contrast to the courtesy recently extended the I'ni
versit\ of Minnesota football team by a Detroit newspaper follow
ing the annual Gopher Michigan game. Minnesota's football pla\*
< rs. although defeated by only a seven point margin, were ridiculed
as a I<>l of "dumb Swedes" and "herring chewers."
It was not so long ago that an ( )hio paper also subjected Minne
sota athletes to satirical comment and criticism, remarking, "Min
nesota. the mere name of which conjures in the sport fan's mind two
common words—power and dumbness—as attested by the annual
strong football teams at the Minneapolis school and the usual scat
ter-brain ball . . .
Minneapolis newspapers are not to blame for these strange trib
utes. Stanford football men who made the trip to Minnesota in
( )ctober can attest to the courtesy and good sportsmanship of the
Minneapolis press.
San b'rancisco newspapers have always been fair and friendly
in their treatment of visiting elevens. I'.astern teams who have
journeyed to California have met with hearty welcomes, and, when
they have been beaten, they have not been subjected to derisive com
ment. In Sunday morning's papers Dartmouth's eleven was given
all due credit for the great game it played against Stanford's In
dians Saturday.
Scornful and jeering comment is never justified, especially in a
newspaper sports review. The Detroit and ()hio papers which were
so unkind in their remarks regarding Minnesota fithletes might
profit from a few lessons in common courtesy.
