IIIIC (II I'ICE WIFE—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Alter seeing "The Office Wife"
moie than one comfortably married
matron will doubtless spend sleep
lc.s night:-; wondering if private
secretaries have knees us alluring
as those of Dorothy Mackaill.
Fortunately in this picture, the
legal wife, aptly portrayed by Na
talie Moorhead, conveniently falls in
love with another man, clearing the
wu/ for the romance of business
man and secretary.
Lewis Stone again demonstrates
that younger men have no chance
competing in love-making with the
efficiency that only long experience
gives.
"The Office Wife" is not "an epic
of llie century" nor "HMO's most
Stirling drama," but a charming in
terlude in th<> screen's usual menu
of song-and-dance monstrosities.
It is unfortunate that the picture
was occasionally permitted to slump
into farce. After all, no drama could
be a complete failure with Dorothy
Mackaill and Lewis Stone. S. H.
THE GORILLA—At the Varsity
Theatre.
This review would bo easier to
write if Palo Alto children would
stay home and read their Sunday
School papers on Sunday afternoon
instead of going to the Varsity sab
bath matinee.
Either hard timos have meant
fewer shows for the Paly kids and
a consequent breaking down of their

former admirable discretion in mat
ters of taste in entertainment, or
"The Gorilla" is a knockout for
laughs and thrills.
For the first time in talkie his
tory, we believe, the audience made
more noise than the sound machine.
It is only as we come lo think of
il that "The Gorilla" is no good. The
story is all hokum. Only because
others were laughing and screaming
with excitement did we laugh and
sit forward on our chair. Hysteria
is contagious.
P.S.: There is a Micky Mouse
comedy; Charlie Chase too.

MITSOIJ. liy Colette. New York:
Albert Hi Charles Boni. 1!) M.
(At the Stanford Bookstore.)
There can be no doubt that Colette
is a clever woman. And "Mitspu" is
a novel of the type which seems to
be typical of (he average person's
idea of the French novel.
The book is written in an unusual
and interesting style which consists
of the alternation of letters, ordin
ary narration, arid dramatic dia
logue.
Mitsou is tho star of a music hall
burlesque company in war-time
Paris. Strangely wise and innocent
at the same time, she is the mistress
of a wealthy business man, but she
has never known love until she
gives herself to a soldier.
The book is amusing, but its ef
forts at seriousness ai'e shallow.
There is nothing in it which merits
much of praise or blame. —E. E. W.
