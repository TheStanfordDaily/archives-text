One of Princeton's 14,000 living
' alumni sincerely advocates open
subsidization of college athletes. If
athletes must be paid, one cannot
object; but why they must attend
classes to receive their pay for work
on the gridiron is beyond compre
hension.
If amateur athletics fails, why
not adopt Heywood Broun's pro
posal to form three sets ofi col
leges—one for real students—
another for embryo gentlemen—
l and another for athletes?
Or another solution would be to
play no favorites in matters of sub
sidization. If football stars are to be
plastered with greenbacks, then let
| us pay debaters, dramatic stars, and
even "phi betes."
C#-cds sunning (heir backs
from a University of McGill
dormitory window caused quite
a crowd to gather in wonder.
Now if this university were lo
cated near the southern Califor
nia beaches, such exposure
would he unnoticed.
Yet one must be broadminded and
not judge our Canadian cousins too
harshly for if two co-eds were to
appear on Hollywood Boulevard
with snowshoes, they would be just
as apt to draw a crowd as the wo
men who attempted to absorb violet
rays at McGill.
Harvard is soon to produce mov
i irig pictures—-both silent and talk
ing. Their first production should be
J a true college picture.
The portrayal would show that
i universities are not song and dance
training schools—that all football
, players do not score in the last min
! ute to defeat the traditional rival
and be carried off the field to the
waiting arms of the dean's daughter.
Until the general public real
izes that "college bred" is not
a four-year loaf, they will never
make government anything but
a synonym for cheap politics.
And until government becomes
a science rather than a feed bag,
things will remain as they are.
A dispatch from Notre Dame
1 states that 75 men turned out for
the varsity debate squad. One reads
this statement and wonders. Was
the notice misunderstood by 70 of
the 75, or are football eustoms
spreading to her realms?
The true millenium will have
been readied when Professor
James G. Emerson, Cardinal de
bate coach, will make such an
nouncements in the Daily's
headlines as "First string to
start against Oxford": "Reserves
meet California in annual fra
cas"; Tricky point gainers
swamp Trojans."

One of Princeton's 14,000 living
' alumni sincerely advocates open
subsidization of college athletes. If
athletes must be paid, one cannot
object; but why they must attend
classes to receive their pay for work
on the gridiron is beyond compre
hension.
If amateur athletics fails, why
not adopt Heywood Broun's pro
posal to form three sets ofi col
leges—one for real students—
another for embryo gentlemen—
l and another for athletes?
Or another solution would be to
play no favorites in matters of sub
sidization. If football stars are to be
plastered with greenbacks, then let

even "phi betes."
C#-cds sunning (heir backs

dormitory window caused quite
a crowd to gather in wonder.
Now if this university were lo

Yet one must be broadminded and
not judge our Canadian cousins too
harshly for if two co-eds were to
appear on Hollywood Boulevard
with snowshoes, they would be just
as apt to draw a crowd as the wo

Harvard is soon to produce mov

J a true college picture.
The portrayal would show that
i universities are not song and dance
training schools—that all football

and be carried off the field to the
waiting arms of the dean's daughter.
Until the general public real
izes that "college bred" is not
a four-year loaf, they will never
make government anything but
a synonym for cheap politics.
And until government becomes
a science rather than a feed bag,
things will remain as they are.
A dispatch from Notre Dame

the varsity debate squad. One reads
this statement and wonders. Was
the notice misunderstood by 70 of
the 75, or are football eustoms
spreading to her realms?
The true millenium will have
been readied when Professor
James G. Emerson, Cardinal de
