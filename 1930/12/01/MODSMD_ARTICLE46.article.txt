Mornings after are always the
hardest time for anyone to be happy,
or even civil, what with trying to
1 remember the difference between
Isaac Walton's law of diminishing
returns, for the fish course you're
1 taking, and Cousin Jim's new recipe
for making'fourteen-day beer in a
ten-gallon gasoline can.

i
Maybe it was because the sun
i came out just in time, or maybe the
West just naturally is superior to its
old Eastern relatives. Anyhow,
Stanford certainly put up a fight to
ruin Dartmouth's hopes completely,
! Saturday afternoon. Betting was
r three to one in Dartmouth's favor,
so maybe the sting of being called
the underdog brought forth our var
sity's unprecedented show of foot
; ball-mindedness. The fact remains
j we won! •
I Wonder if the change in Stan-
I ford's slang title, from Cards to In
dians, had anything to do with it?
' It's a good change if it makes the
I boys feel more as if they are fight—
| ing on their own hook, instead of
being played with by one master
hand and mind. Otherwise, we don't
j like the new name so well. Sounds
1 too much like too many bum base
! ball teams.
Somehow, we expected more of a
crowd to be sitting around the sta
dium to watch our rooting stunts,
than actually appeared at ihe game.
Guess the charitable half of the
j proposition can't have been very
j successful. A real philanthropist
I among us should have reminded a
1 responsible Power that Charity
ought to begin at home ....
I
I Which gives us just the right
opening for the burning question:
j Did you all see and fully appreciate
' the Daily-Chappie game, between

halves? Chappie's editor proved
himself a better football captain
than anything else we've seen him
do—which is saying a good deal.
(Will you please consider that a
rising vote of approval, Mr. Editor?)
One ambitious fraternity house,
near the upper end of the Row, took
advantage of the holidays to culti
vate, aggravate, irritate, and other
wise make a public menace of their
lawn. Somebody will probably start
a tannery on the campus during
Christmas vacation. Nothing like
preparing the pigskins for next grid
iron season.
