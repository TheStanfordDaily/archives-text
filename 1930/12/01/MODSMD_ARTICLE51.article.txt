AND THAT'S THAT
Saturday's clash saw the virtual
transformation of the Stanford
quad into a shifting team. Due no
louht to Dartmouth's peculiar de
cisive tactics of not shifting to
neet it, and to the over-anxious
iess o! the Green line to greet the
-lav, the Cards—pardon, the Indians
used the shift regularly.
One Chuck Hhrhorn at tackle prac
ically stole the show as far as in
lividual performances go Saturday,
reverses around the other
ide ot the line before they were
veil under way, knocking down
•asses be to re they were fairly
notched, this lanky lad |hi( oil the
tuesl exhibition of tackle play it lias
ver heen yours Iruly's privilege to
vatrli.
Speaking of tackles, George Grey
ooked more like a senior than a
ophomore linesman with the ease
ie snared forward passes. In Grey
nd Ehrhorn, Pop will have as sweet
pair cj" tackles as can bo found on
liis coast. For Dartmouth, Good
villi** performed more brilliantly
han the alleged All-American, Cre
tan.
Fiery Bill Dotib was here, there,
nd everywhere on the field, spread
ng consternation anions the backs,
overing punts like a wolf, smear
ug reverses, and in general playing
•is finest game of the year, Kill
amc through nobly. A trifle green
t the opening of the season, Dmih
ias justified the faith Warner iias
tad in him, and he will be a wcl
oine sight out there at right end
text September.
Hard-working Harry Hillman,\yel
iw mask and all, moved his 200
iounds about the field with con
idorable celerity to nail numerous
Dartmouth backs. With the center
rio f)f Stanford being taken for a
ide, Harry was worth his weight in
old backing up the line. And Hill
nan runs interference, something
ew Stanford backs take the trouble
(j (in well. Better than Fleishhackcr,
ay we.
Dartmouth used a punt formation
i) good advantage. When eligible re
eivers were covered, the Green
lacks did not hesitate to run with
lie ball, and the dashes from punt
urination gained entirely too much
round to suit the rooting section,
lie spin play, however, seemed to
if entirely neglected by Cannell.
«ot only did Dartmouth fail to use
, but it proved to be a big ground
ainer for the Rcdsliirts.
Slippery Phil Moffatt slipped l
bout the gridiron in heart-break
ig manner Saturday. Handicapped i
y the wet field, Stanford's usually j
ure-footed halfback did most of his
utting in on his side. Had the turf
ried off, Moffatt would have had a
ettcr day. As it was, he averaged
x yards per carry, which needs no 1
inunent. His work knocking down >
asses was outstanding all afternoon, ,
>v the majority of the Green tosses
'ere far-flung.
Hill Morton, the Green's outstand
iK ball carrier. Hashed with con- I
slen brilliance. Kicking well, Mor
>n on power shots through the line
elied his 175 pounds with a dy
amic drive. Had Cannell possessed
iiothcr back of Morton's calibre, the
de of battle might well have gone
ie other way. —L. K., Jr.
