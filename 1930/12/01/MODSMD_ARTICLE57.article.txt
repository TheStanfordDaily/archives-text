# HOORAY FOR THE NORTHWEST!
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
All hail to the Pacific Northwest!
This seems to be their big year in
many sports, and though they can
not claim the golf, polo, tennis, or
crew championships, they can still
do plenty of crowing about the rec
ords their sons and daughters have
made in sports during the year i930.
The following list is far from com
plete, but look at a few of those
who have brought honor and glory
to one section of North America.
Jimmy McLarnin, of Vancouver,
is probably the best fighter for his
age in the business today.

The Washington State University's
football team, which defeated Cali
fornia, Southern California, Oregon
State, and Washington, among
others, will represent the Far West
in the annual Tournament of Roses
game at Pasadena on New Year's
Day. Coach Babe Hollingbery de
serves much credit for winning the
Coast Conference Championship
and his team, individually and col
lectively, deserves even more. Also
Washington, beaten only 3 to 0 by
the Cougars, defeated California in
its first year under its new coach,

Jimmy Phelan. And Oregon also
with a new coach, Fat Spears, which
beat Washington.
Helene Madison, remarkable 17-
year-old girl swimmer, who broke
twenty-seven American and world's
records, had 26 of them accepted
recently by the A.A.U.
In track and field sports, athletes
from the Pacific Northwest reigned
| supreme. Jessup, Brix, Anderson,
Hill, and Genung broke or equaled
world's, American, or A.A.U. cham
pionship records during the year.
Coach "Hec" Edmundson, who

coached the Washington A.C. team
that did so well in the A.A.U. cham
pionships at Pittsburgh last Au
gust, deserves a big hand.
In golf, Don Moe and Dr. Willing
won their Walker Cup matches, al- j
though they did not exactly shine
â€¢ in the national amateur champion
| ships at Merion later on.
Johnny Frederick and Sylvester.
Johnson are from Portland, Oregon,
| and Earl Averill and Ira Flagstead
| are from Washington, to mention
| some ball players whose homes are
i in the Pacific Northwest.
