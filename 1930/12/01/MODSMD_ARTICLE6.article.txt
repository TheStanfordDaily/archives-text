## Committee Will Investigate Expenses Of Campaign 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30
Chairman Nye of the Senate cam
paign funds investigating committee
announced today he intended to ask
Senator - elect Davis, Republican,
Pennsylvania, to stand aside tomor
row when he presents his credentials
for entry in the Senate until the
committee can inquire into reports
of new expenditures in his campaign.
This decision was reached today
by Senator Nye upon receipt of
word from Pennsylvania that a
supplemental report of expenditures
in the Republican primary had
brought the total to about $520,000
spent on behalf of the Davis-Brown
ticket. Francis Shunk Brown was
candidate for governor on the ticket
with Davis in the primary.
Nye's request is expected to defer
at least temporarily the seating of
Davis, who retires tomorrow from
the labor post in President Hoover's
cabinet. Senator Nye said he would
give assurance in making his request
that the committee would complete
its inquiry within "one or two days."
