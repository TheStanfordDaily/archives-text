# CONGRESS IN HARNESS FOR SHORT TERM
## Police Dispel Communistic Rioters With Placards at Capitol Door 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. (/!').—
Hardly had Congress come together
today before Senators and Repre
sentatives alike began sending num
erous and varied legislative proposals
down that long and difiicul journey
which but a few survive.
There was one that seemed assured
of success, a bill by Senator Robin
son —Democratic leader—for $60,-
000,000 to be advanced as loans for
seed and feed to drought suffering
farmers. A Democrat also will spon
sor it in the House, and Republican
co-operation for enactment is prac
tically a certainty.
Urge Jobless Aid
A permanent commission "dealing
exclusively with the problem of
maintaining the best conditions in
industry and keep working men per
manently employed," was called for
in a bill by Representative Ludlow,
Democrat, Indiana.
An international celebration in
Los Angeles upon completion of the
Boulder Canyon, project in 1937 was
proposed in a resolution by Repre
sentative Swing, Republican, Cali
fornia.
A bill to authorized qonstruction
of a $35,000 highway along the south
shore of Lake "Superior was intro
duced by Representative Peavey, Re
publican, Wisconsin.
Riot Dispelled
Representative Summers, Repub
lican of Washington, introduced a
bill to authorize a $1,000,000 loan
fund for farmers in crop failure areas
of his state. A crowd of several hun
dred persons, some calling themselves
Communists, gathered in front of
the Capitol today carrying placards
which were quickly torn down by
the police.
