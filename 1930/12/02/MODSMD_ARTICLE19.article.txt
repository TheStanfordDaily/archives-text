BERKELEY, Calif., Dec. 1 (112t I ).â€”
Thomas Putnam, dean of men at
the University of California, an
! nounced today the faculty would
undertake an independent investi
gation of the athletic situation on
the university campus.
Dean Putnam said the probe was
a direct result of the recent foot
ball war climaxed by the resigna
tion of the head football coach, Clar
ence ("Nibs") Price, but added all
phases of athletics would be investi
i gated by the faculty committee.
The Dean said he hoped all col
leges in the conference would fol
low suit with similar inquiries. In
formation gathered t>n the Berke
ley campus will be set before dele
gates to the Pacific Coast Confer
ence in Los Angeles, Dec. 8, when
the entire subject of asserted pro
| fessionalism and subsidy of football
players in Pacific Coast colleges will
be reviewed.
The faculty investigation will be
carried on independently of the exe
cutive committee study authorized
by the Associated Students last
Tuesday.
