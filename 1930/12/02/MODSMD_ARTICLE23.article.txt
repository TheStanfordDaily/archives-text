# STANFORD'S "IRON HORSE" FIRST PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE ON COAST
## 
### 
Additional knowledge has recently |
been acquired concerning Stanford's j
"iron horse," which has been retired
from active service these many years.
Frank Lemos, assistant curator at
the Museum and the recipient of a
letter written by George T. Clark,
former Stanford librarian, now liv
-1 ing in Palo Alto, has revealed some
illuminating hitherto unknown de
tails of the old relic which fills up
I one of the rooms of the Museum.
Tooting and ramping no more over
California hills and down the valleys
opened up by the early railroads of
i the state, what is now the prize ex
' i hibit for the Stanford Museum was
• the first passenger locomotive put in
service on the Pacific coast.
While engaged in research in early
Californian history, Clark chanced
, to see an item in the files of the Sac
ramento Union of the early Califor
. nian days, which threw light on the
1 origin and first reception of the pride
> and joy of the Stanford Museum.
: According to Clark's letter, the
t Central Pacific shipped this ancestor
of the leviathans that pound over the
■ countryside, now, to California by
way of Cape Horn.

] The engine's arrival in the state
j was quite a gala event, Clark goes
|on to say. After being transported
lo Sacramcnto where it was assem
i bled, its boiler first felt the life
-5 giving heat of steam on November
j!), 38G3, when the first run was made.
! This event was of sufficient impor
i tance to be observed by a salute of
j 35 guns.
In those days of bowie knives and
j two-gun men, Leland Stanford was
| Governor of California as well as
! President of the Central Pacific rail
| road. Needless to say he was pres
-1 ent at the proud inauguration of the
I new locomotive.
Great crowds of Californians from
I the surrounding countryside thrilled
to the inspiring toot and clang of the
bell of old "ironsides" as it proudly
drew a string of sparkling new
coaches along, like a hen leading a
new family of chicks before an ad
miring farmyard audience.
A new sign bearing the added in
formation concerning one of the Mu
seum's most romantic sources of in
terest will be posted for the benefit
of visitors.
