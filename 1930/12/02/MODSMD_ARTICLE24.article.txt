# TRAMPS WAKE UP IN HOBO PARADISE
## 
### 
ASHLAND, Wis., Dec. 1 (ft*).
Tramps, encamped near here
awoke yesterday morning to
find pork sausage and picnic
hams "growing" on tree
branches.
Investigation x'evealed that a
meat truck had been wrecked
during the night with such
force that the sausages and
hams were hurled into the air,
many of the bundles sticking
on the branches of nearby
trees.
