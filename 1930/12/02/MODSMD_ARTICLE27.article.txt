# Basketball Claims Spotlight On Farm; New Interest Seen
## Court Game Under John Bunn, new Card Coach, Shows Awakening from Lethargic Interest of Past; Six Gridmen Report for Practice 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
Willi the red-striped moleskins cleaned of gridiron dirt and lucked
away'in the mothballs for another year, the next three months will find
basketball in the sport spotlight on the Farm.
Under the leadership of Coach John W. Bunn, the court game seems
to have awakened new interest at Stanford; the indifferent attitude of

•fans for the past few years during
the futile attempts of Cardinal quin
tets to turn in winning records seems
to have been forgotten.
Gridmen Report
While football has been receiving
all the attention of the followers of
sports, all quarter Coach Bunn has
been drilling a hard-working group
of basketball men in fundamentals
and a style of play which are en
tirely new to Cardinal courtmen.
With several athletes who have
been busy on the gridiron for the
past three months turning out for
basketball for the first time yester
j day, not a little talent has been
! added to Bunn's squad, which can
j now settle down to develop a learn
; from the best material available on
J the Farm.
Added Talent
Rintala, Doub and Baker were on
j hand yesterday, while tomorrow
should find MolTatt, Tyler and Col
vin on the job. Of these recruits
from the gridiron, Tyler and Doub
played on last year's quintet, while
the other four did not turn out for
the court game.
MolTatt played varsity basketball
!in his sophomore year. Rintala and
Baker played together on the fresh
man team of 1929. Colvin was on the
squad during his freshman year, and
this season will be a candidate for
| the center position, for which Bunn
has found a shortage of men tall
enough to qualify.
Because so many of this year's
squad are seniors, and because his
system is new to Stanford basket
ball, Bunn is going to keep the un
usually large roster of 30 through
| out the season.
Enthusiasm Shown
j Bunn sees the advantage of expe
' rience in a senior squad, hut also
! recognizes its disadvantages. Not
| only will this talent be lost next
j year, but the men are quite set in
' their style of play and naturally find
1 it hard to change even the funda
mentals on such short notice. How
ever, they are tackling their job with
an enthusiasm which the new coach
says he has never seen equaled.
Yesterday's practice was devoted
mostly to passing, shooting, and floor
work, with the squad divided into
groups of five. The first quintet to
take the floor included Mead and
Hawkins at forward, Mears at cen
ter, and Fawcett and Captain Rey
nolds at guard. All are lettermen
from last year but Mead, who starred
in the forward berth for the fresh
man team.
Nothing Definite
Though Fawcett was the main
threat of last year's varsity at for
ward, Bunn believes that the guard
position is the proper place for this
shifty player. With the perfection of
his long shots, Fawcett should be
come one of the best guards on the
coast, since he is deceptive enough
to throw opposing men off balance
and draw their guards out of posi
tion to give Bunn's offense a chance
to function.
The second five to take the floor
included Ray and Hepp at forward,
McElwain at center, and Tway and
Edelen at guard.
Bunn stated that nothing is defin
ite as yet, but with the new men

turning out and gradually fitting into
the new style of play, things will be
gin to round into shape rapidly.

Gridmen Report
While football has been receiving
all the attention of the followers of
sports, all quarter Coach Bunn has
been drilling a hard-working group
of basketball men in fundamentals
and a style of play which are en
tirely new to Cardinal courtmen.
With several athletes who have
been busy on the gridiron for the
past three months turning out for
basketball for the first time yester
j day, not a little talent has been
! added to Bunn's squad, which can
j now settle down to develop a learn
; from the best material available on
J the Farm.
Added Talent
Rintala, Doub and Baker were on
j hand yesterday, while tomorrow
should find MolTatt, Tyler and Col
vin on the job. Of these recruits
from the gridiron, Tyler and Doub
played on last year's quintet, while
the other four did not turn out for
the court game.
MolTatt played varsity basketball
!in his sophomore year. Rintala and
Baker played together on the fresh
man team of 1929. Colvin was on the
squad during his freshman year, and
this season will be a candidate for
| the center position, for which Bunn
has found a shortage of men tall
enough to qualify.
Because so many of this year's
squad are seniors, and because his
system is new to Stanford basket
ball, Bunn is going to keep the un
usually large roster of 30 through
| out the season.
Enthusiasm Shown
j Bunn sees the advantage of expe
' rience in a senior squad, hut also
! recognizes its disadvantages. Not
| only will this talent be lost next
j year, but the men are quite set in
' their style of play and naturally find
1 it hard to change even the funda
mentals on such short notice. How
ever, they are tackling their job with
an enthusiasm which the new coach
says he has never seen equaled.
Yesterday's practice was devoted
mostly to passing, shooting, and floor
work, with the squad divided into
groups of five. The first quintet to
take the floor included Mead and
Hawkins at forward, Mears at cen
ter, and Fawcett and Captain Rey
nolds at guard. All are lettermen
from last year but Mead, who starred
in the forward berth for the fresh
man team.
Nothing Definite
Though Fawcett was the main
threat of last year's varsity at for
ward, Bunn believes that the guard
position is the proper place for this
shifty player. With the perfection of
his long shots, Fawcett should be
come one of the best guards on the
coast, since he is deceptive enough
to throw opposing men off balance
and draw their guards out of posi
tion to give Bunn's offense a chance
to function.
The second five to take the floor
included Ray and Hepp at forward,
McElwain at center, and Tway and
Edelen at guard.
Bunn stated that nothing is defin
ite as yet, but with the new men

turning out and gradually fitting into
the new style of play, things will be
