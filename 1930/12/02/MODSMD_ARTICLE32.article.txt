# COURT DENIES PARDON PLEA FOR BILLINGS
## Verdict Also Holds Mooney Behind Quentin Bars On Life Sentence CASE JUST REVAMPED 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1 (/}').
For the second time this year the
California Supreme Court refused
today to recommend a pardon for
Warren K. Billings, serving a life
sentence for allegedly bombing y
preparedness parade here in 191(Â»
killing ten persons and injuring 40
more.
The decision likewise affects the
fate of Thomas J. Mooney, also
serving a life term in the same con
nection. Mooney, at San Quentin
and Billings at Folsom, said they
wore not surprised at the decisions.
Although the formal* decision was
being revamped for issuance later
in the day H was understood the
refusal was based on substantially
the same grounds as the decision
issued last July 4 which held that
nothing had occurred since the or
iginal trials of the two men to alter
the opinion of the court that both
were guilty.
In the decision today Justice Wil
liam H. Langdon dissented as he
did last July on the ground Billings
is entitled to clemency. He pre
pared a separate opinion. Two other
justices, although concurring, issued
separate opinions explaining their
attitudes.
The decision goes to Governor C.
C. Young in the form of a recom
mendation. Under California law
a man twice convicted of a felony,
as Billings has been, cannot appeal
direct to the governor for a pardon.
