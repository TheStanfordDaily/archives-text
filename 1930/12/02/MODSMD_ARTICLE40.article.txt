# AYE, A NOBLE EXPERIMENT

for llie first time in history, sororiu women will live ;il Ruble
11 a! I during rushing this year. The experiment presents numerous
po ■ ibilities in the way of advantages and disadvantages, and at ibis
stage of development the only certainty is that the sponsor group

I hat the presence of kow women may lead to difficult problems
in the hall can hardly be denied; but that unified and upright action
on the part of the sponsor group will be to the benefit of the new
women is evident.
If nothing more, the absence of the old, artificial break at the end
ill fall quarter will lend stability to I lie atmosphere of a rather cha< it ic
dormitory. The continuance of residence at,the hall by sorority
Women during the tumult of rushing will be one proof that (I reek
letters are not the onk thing in college. The mantenance of calmness
and a normal attitude by these women will perhaps show the fresh
men that life holds more for them than an Hellenic motto, a pass
word, and a handshake.
Whatever the developments, the sponsors arc acting unselfishly
p t i rhaps laying themselves open to serious criticism--that the new
women will survive the better, the annual chaos of rushing.
