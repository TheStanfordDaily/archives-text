CANARIES SOMETIMES SIN<; By
Frederick Lonsdale. I). Apple -

I Mi 1 . Lonsdale has taken that su
perannuated situation of the best
j friend and the wile; he has made
the maddest hodge-podge imagin
'< able. The result is not extremely
happy.
Of a miniature cast Geoffrey
Lymes is the most intriguing at the
I e nd of the first act. One sees in him
I the witty writer with that unique
ability given to writers in drawing
dramas to see both sides of a situa
tion and choose the most ironic
j upon which to comment cynically,
delightfully.
But behold, by the end of the
third, Geoffrey has become a shallow
gentleman, afraid of comment,
which leaves Mr. Lonsdale free to
end the play just as he began it and
quite without indulgence in illicit
amour or even a prolonged kiss by
the mixed pairs.
This effort lasted, deservedly, just

three weeks on Broadway. —J. S. S.
ARISTOPHANES LYSISTRATA: A
new version by Gilbert Seldes.
Farrar and Rinehart. (At the
Palo Alto Rook Shop.)
Soul-saving churchmen have late
ly protested performance of this
drama together with that of Mr.
Carroll's Vanities because of their
bawdiness.
We see nothing harmful in it; in
fact we find a noble and tremendous
purpose in its lines. Mr. Seldes, hav
ing been through the horrors of
war, would naturally be overjoyed
at the possibility of pointing out to
the theatre-going public, methods
of suppressing war as practiced by
the glorious ancients.
Seldes has re-written Aristo
phanes' ancient but extremely virile
comedy with admirable audacity. In
present, form, one is not at wit's end
to understand the affection of the
public for it. After a ponderous first
act the play resolves itself into a
i merry farce. —J. S. S.
