According to the History book,
there was a time when co-eds madt
cinnamon toast and Welsh rabbits
and vilely de-caffinized coffee, lo
inveigle gentlemen of their choice
to spend an hour in their company.
Now they hurry over to the Psych
lab, in spare moments, and use white
I delete for their experiments.
Have just compiled a list of can
i didates for our private hell (after
the Minnesota Gopher, after von
Baden):
Goofs with iron heel plates
who clatter up and down library
aisles; people who wisper in his
tory lectures; co-eds who paint
their fingernails; girls who for
get dates, faces, and the "hello"
system;
Owners of grayish shoulder
straps and spotted shirt-fronts.
And the man who invented
lower division requirements, and
prerequisites to graduate
I courses.

I We have it upon good authority |
! that (he B.A.C. entertained a lot
[ more than the football team with
' their dinner-dance in San Francisco,
Saturday night. More strange faces,
too little battered to have been
hard-smashed into the gridiron, ap
peared there as would-be-wor
shipped heroes.
Sometime on toward down, Sun
day morning, a member of the Stan- j
ford squad locked fenders with a
car driven by another member of
said football team, at a particularly
foggy street corner., Each climbed
sleepily out of his machine.
The first yawned, "Awfully sorry I
, —'s a clumsy trick I pulled. T.'s my J
name—from Stanford University." !
The second, a little sleepier: "Why, j
that's all right. I go to Stanford my- I
self. Had a bad night of it.—H. is my
name. Look me up sometime . . .
When Deke meets Deke some
one ought to lie around to call
