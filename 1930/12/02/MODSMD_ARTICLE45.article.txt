A professor at the University of
Washington claims that modern
, help women to think.
That may be true, but one might
venture that the principal thought
that women's clothes cultivate is

Then one must also remem

The Colonel of the R.O.T.C. at
\ Michigan State College states that
college men will lead the next war.
Perhaps some of the present
cadets will see service at (he front;
1 but those that major in economics

Vassar stresses the need of intel
! lectual integrity. This means being
honest with one's own inner convic

At college, there is apt <o he a
great temptation to give profes-
I sors the answers that correspond

The editor of the University of
Aberdeen paper finds that the most
common female delusion is that to

study is to know;" but it takes more
than knowledge to make wisdom.
Then again some collegians
feel that study and wisdom are
incompatible, and consequently
forsake (he former for seeing
movies and drinking milk
shakes.
