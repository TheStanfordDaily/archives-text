# SIDELINE SLANTS
## THE 						KING IS DEAD 
### 
We have an apology to make to
Kay Hulcn, first string guard on the
lUSJO Big lied Machine. In yesterday
morning's Daily in a story under our
hy-line, we made the mistake of
saying that Hulcn would he lost to
the team next year. He will he hack
ivilli hells on for the IIKSI campaigns.
While the footballs are being
packed in mothballs, while the tu
mult of all-Coast, all-American, all
this, and ail-that football eleven
selections occupies space in publica
tions, King Football has practically
passed from the land. But the Notre
Dame-Southern California, the Ala
bama-Washington State, and the
All-Star East vs. All-Star West lilts
remain.
And the Stanford squad for one
is g lad (1 ic Autumn festivities are
finished. Phil MolVatt has left 2(t
precious pounds on assorted grid
irons this season, Perry Taylor has
accumulated numerous sears, Cap
lain IJav Tandy has a knee to re
mind him of 19,' M), and so on down
the line. But nc\t season the men
will he hack full of fire for another
campaign against Minnesota. Dart
mouth. Southern California. Califor
nia, and the rest of the pack.
The Indians lose quite a football
Icam tljis year—there are Albertson
and Bush at end, Captain Tandy and
Bogue and Burke at tackle, Bardin
at guard, Taylor at center, Winnek
at quarter, Simkins and Rothert at
fullback, and Bill Clark and Bill
Laird as halfbacks—not the worst
eleven men in the world, by any
means.
But I!).'!! vvi'l probably see a fair
team with Neill and Doub paired at
(lie flanks. Grey and Ehrhorn caring
for the tackle posts. Heiser and
Dawson at guard. Mar Albertson
tossing the hall bacK. Harry Hilhr.an
at quarter, MolVatt and Caddeli or
( aglieri at half, and Dusty Allen at
fullback. Finding a fullback should
he (he toughest problem, along with
capable reserves for the line.
Putting ourselves on the spot vol
untarily, we predict that Notre
Dame will probably take the Tro
jans, although the margin of victory
will be as close as it was last year—
which was one point, if we remem
bei correctly. Southern California
may make us out to be a liar again,
though.
We point with pride, however, to
the feu things we did predict right
ly. Even the editorial column lias
seen (it to corroborate our sug'ges- !
lion made immediately after the
IJ.S.C. game—namely, to play the
Trojans later in the season. How i
:ihont it'.' We feel that U.S.C. would
still have beaten us, but not by the |
terrific margin, if the game had been
played later in the year.
Then there is the matter of Har- ,
low Rothert—and we owe Harlow
an apology for saying he lacked
drive—whom we picked as quite a ,
football player before the season <
was finished. What a record lhat ,
hoy has! We will have more to say 1
about this later—but wc take off 1
uur hats to Harlow, who closed his j
career at Stanford by contributing j
/lie touchdown against Dartmouth.
Remember that Slants on "Ex
firays?" What do you think of Bill
Douh. Don Colviu. George Grey, A 1
Hunt. Red Hand, Spud Hardy, Ted
Kite, Tom Lambert, lis 11 Marks, and
Phil Baker now? Hell! Heh!—we
'<>ld you so. And remember this—a
hunk\ lad dubbed Paul Pierre
Pablo Pansy Targhelta, who is as
• road as thai, will play a neat game
>112 center before he graduates.
Stanford set a new record this j
season. Never a game passed but the ■
,'edshirts achieved a higher yard- j
ige total in penalties than (hat. cred- j
ted to their opponents. And as n J
•uess, we think that if the records !
were examined, the bulk of the >
penalties would be due to incom- j
jleted forward passes, which speaks j

j well for clean playing of the cr, ah—
Indians.
In inilman, Rothert, and Moffat 1,
Warner lias possessed as fine a trio
(.! backs as can be found anywhere,
say wc. In there working for every
game. Iliilman lias received perhaps
(lie least praise of (lie (hree. and we
would hate to choose the best man
of this group. Starting slowly, and
receiving a severe setback a( (lie
hands of the Trojans, the line im
proved markedly in its play until
it rose to a peak and held (lie
mighty, muchly-heralded Green for
ward wall to very few openings.
Not such a bad season after all,
iconic to think of it! —L. K.. Jr.

were examined, the bulk of the >
penalties would be due to incom- j

We have an apology to make to
Kay Hulcn, first string guard on the
lUSJO Big lied Machine. In yesterday
morning's Daily in a story under our
hy-line, we made the mistake of
saying that Hulcn would he lost to
the team next year. He will he hack
ivilli hells on for the IIKSI campaigns.
While the footballs are being
packed in mothballs, while the tu
mult of all-Coast, all-American, all
this, and ail-that football eleven
selections occupies space in publica
tions, King Football has practically
passed from the land. But the Notre
Dame-Southern California, the Ala
bama-Washington State, and the
All-Star East vs. All-Star West lilts
remain.
And the Stanford squad for one
is g lad (1 ic Autumn festivities are
finished. Phil MolVatt has left 2(t
precious pounds on assorted grid
irons this season, Perry Taylor has
accumulated numerous sears, Cap
lain IJav Tandy has a knee to re
mind him of 19,' M), and so on down
the line. But nc\t season the men
will he hack full of fire for another
campaign against Minnesota. Dart
mouth. Southern California. Califor
nia, and the rest of the pack.
The Indians lose quite a football
Icam tljis year—there are Albertson
and Bush at end, Captain Tandy and
Bogue and Burke at tackle, Bardin
at guard, Taylor at center, Winnek
at quarter, Simkins and Rothert at
fullback, and Bill Clark and Bill
Laird as halfbacks—not the worst
eleven men in the world, by any
means.
But I!).'!! vvi'l probably see a fair
team with Neill and Doub paired at
(lie flanks. Grey and Ehrhorn caring
for the tackle posts. Heiser and
Dawson at guard. Mar Albertson
tossing the hall bacK. Harry Hilhr.an
at quarter, MolVatt and Caddeli or
( aglieri at half, and Dusty Allen at
fullback. Finding a fullback should
he (he toughest problem, along with
capable reserves for the line.
Putting ourselves on the spot vol
untarily, we predict that Notre
Dame will probably take the Tro
jans, although the margin of victory
will be as close as it was last year—
which was one point, if we remem
bei correctly. Southern California
may make us out to be a liar again,
though.
We point with pride, however, to
the feu things we did predict right
ly. Even the editorial column lias
seen (it to corroborate our sug'ges- !
lion made immediately after the
IJ.S.C. game—namely, to play the
Trojans later in the season. How i
:ihont it'.' We feel that U.S.C. would
still have beaten us, but not by the |
terrific margin, if the game had been
played later in the year.
Then there is the matter of Har- ,
low Rothert—and we owe Harlow
an apology for saying he lacked
drive—whom we picked as quite a ,
football player before the season <
was finished. What a record lhat ,
hoy has! We will have more to say 1
about this later—but wc take off 1
uur hats to Harlow, who closed his j
career at Stanford by contributing j
/lie touchdown against Dartmouth.
Remember that Slants on "Ex
firays?" What do you think of Bill
Douh. Don Colviu. George Grey, A 1
Hunt. Red Hand, Spud Hardy, Ted
Kite, Tom Lambert, lis 11 Marks, and
Phil Baker now? Hell! Heh!—we
'<>ld you so. And remember this—a
