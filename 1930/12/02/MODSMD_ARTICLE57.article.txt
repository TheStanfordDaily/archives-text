# Six Mural Grid Teams Clash This Afternoon
## LEAGUE WINNERS TO ELIMINATE ALL BUT THREE TEAMS Finals Match to be Played Next Week by Two Surviving Teams 
### 
Only three touch football teams
will remain in the race for the intra
mural title after Joday's clashes be
tween Theta Chi and Deita Tau
; Delta, champions of leagues I and II,
between Sigma Nil and Sigma Chi,
: winners of leagues 1JI and IV, and
between the A.K.L.'s and the Phi
Sigs, joint leaders of V.
Both Theta Chi and Delta Tau
; Delta, who are to meet at 3:30 o'clock
on the freshmen field, came through
their preliminary games without de
feat. A tight defense and an oppor
! tune offense have been the reasons
for the Theta Chi victories over the
D.U.'s, l!i-0, the Phi Kaps, G-0, the
Theta Delts, 47-0, and the Betas,
None of these victims succeeded
1 in bottling up the potent passing
! combination of the Theta Chi's, Zu
ger to Howe.
Ddt Running Attack
Showing constant improvement,
i (lie Delts rang up their wins at the
expense of El Campo, 14-0, Sequoia
|I 7-(>, Kappa Alpha, 33-0, the Alpha
Delts, 18-6, and the Fijis 33-0. The
Delts' running attack, which fea
' tures past and present Stanford track
| stars, reached its height in this last
game with the second place Fijis.
It scored three touchdowns in the
first five minutes of play. Ross Nich
ols, greatest of all Stanford high
jumpers, is an outstanding member
of the Delts' fast backtield.
Sigmu Nu, which is to meet Sigma
i Chi on the Grays' field at 3:30 o'clock,
' won the championship of League III
| by three close wins and two defaults,
I but they beat the second place club,
i El Toro, handily. After winning four
! straight games in IV, Sigma Chi's
march to the league championship
was checked by a 6-6 tie with Se
! quoia II, but the latter team was
1 found to have played an ineligible
| man; so the former was awarded the
1 championship.
Two Unbeaten Teams
Alpha Kappa Lambda and Phi
Sigma Kappa will seek to shatter
j each other's undefeated record and
i joint leadership of league V when
they meet at 2:30 on the Gray's field.
I The former team has the more im
pressive record, which includes live
! straight wins, the last from the strong
Phi Delts. Marple, the cleverest run
| ner in the tournament, is the spear
head of their offense. Utilizing the
good interference of his teammates,
j he has scored at least one touchdown
! in every game.
One of the three survivors of to
1 day's play will receive a bye, while
the other two will be matched to de
| termine the second finalist. The
1 championship game between the two
teams which emerge as finalists from
i field of 31 starters will take place
! next week.
