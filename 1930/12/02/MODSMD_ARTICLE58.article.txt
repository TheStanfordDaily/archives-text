## Howard Jones Preparing Trojans to Prevent Carideo's Giving Them Another Ride Saturday 
### Feg Murray, '16 
"Beware the Ides of March," some
soothsayer warned Julius Caesar,
the Noblest Roman of them all. But
now the warning reads: "Beware
the CnvlDEo's of November," and
Howard Jones, the Noblest Trojan
of them all, is paying much heed to
the warning. So much so, in fact,
that he had the U.S.C.-Notre Dame
game scheduled for December, with
a prayer that Mr. Carideo would be
a bit weary after November games
with Indiana, Penn, Drake, North
western, and Army. Southern Cali
fornia has met Mr. Carideo before,
in fact was "taken for a ride" in
Chicago last year by Rockne's AU-
Ameriean quarterback, whose last
name, if you look closely, has a
R-I-D-E in the middle of it.
'But the Trojans aren't expecting
any such thing to happen again,
especially when they entertain the
"Irish" in the Los Angeles Coliseum
on December 6 in one of the biggest
games in this or any other year.
Howard Jones has two quarterbacks j

in Marshall Dufficld and Irv Mohler,
who are better ball carriers than
Carideo, but I doubt if their com
bined football brains equal the grid
iron gray matter of the Notre Dame
field general.
Carideo is an ideal quarterback,
a typical "Notre Dame quarterback,"
and in carrying out the two most
important jobs in the Rockne sys
tem—i.e., directing the team and
blocking—he has no superior. But
besides those two all-important fea
tures, the chunky Italian can punt,
pass, run, and kick extra points
after touchdowns along with the best
in the country. Carideo has seldom
carried the ball this year, but his
punting has been truly remarkable.
His cleverly placed kicks to "coffin
corner" were important factors in
Notre Dame's victory over North
western. On successive punts Rock
ne's field general curved the ball
over the sidelines on Northwestern's
1-yard mark, 10-yard line, and 11-
yard line. That's kicking, boys—and
the Trojans better beware!

a typical "Notre Dame quarterback,"
and in carrying out the two most
important jobs in the Rockne sys
tem—i.e., directing the team and
blocking—he has no superior. But
besides those two all-important fea
tures, the chunky Italian can punt,
pass, run, and kick extra points
after touchdowns along with the best
in the country. Carideo has seldom
carried the ball this year, but his
punting has been truly remarkable.
His cleverly placed kicks to "coffin
corner" were important factors in
Notre Dame's victory over North
western. On successive punts Rock
ne's field general curved the ball
over the sidelines on Northwestern's
1-yard mark, 10-yard line, and 11-
yard line. That's kicking, boys—and
the Trojans better beware!

"Beware the Ides of March," some
soothsayer warned Julius Caesar,
the Noblest Roman of them all. But
now the warning reads: "Beware
the CnvlDEo's of November," and
Howard Jones, the Noblest Trojan
of them all, is paying much heed to
the warning. So much so, in fact,
that he had the U.S.C.-Notre Dame
game scheduled for December, with
a prayer that Mr. Carideo would be
a bit weary after November games
with Indiana, Penn, Drake, North
western, and Army. Southern Cali
fornia has met Mr. Carideo before,
in fact was "taken for a ride" in
Chicago last year by Rockne's AU-
Ameriean quarterback, whose last
name, if you look closely, has a
R-I-D-E in the middle of it.
'But the Trojans aren't expecting
any such thing to happen again,
especially when they entertain the
"Irish" in the Los Angeles Coliseum
on December 6 in one of the biggest
games in this or any other year.
Howard Jones has two quarterbacks j

in Marshall Dufficld and Irv Mohler,
who are better ball carriers than
Carideo, but I doubt if their com
bined football brains equal the grid
iron gray matter of the Notre Dame
field general.
Carideo is an ideal quarterback,

and in carrying out the two most
important jobs in the Rockne sys
tem—i.e., directing the team and
blocking—he has no superior. But
