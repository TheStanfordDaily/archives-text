# WARNER POSTPONES ELECTION OF GRID CAPTAIN TILL NEXT AUTUMN
## 
### 
Stanford will be without a captain
for her 1931 football season until next
September at least, according io an
announcement made yesterday by
Coach Glenn Scobey Warner of the
Indian squad. For the first time in
his seven-year regime at Stanford,
Warner has seen fit to postpone the
election of a football leader until
after the opening of the next grid
iron season.
Although Warner gave no reason
for his action in delaying the election
of captain, several factors are be
lieved to have influenced his position.
In the first place, the Old Fox is in
clined to the opinion that the men
who play under the new chieftain,
not the graduating lettermen, are
best suited to the job of choosing
their head.
Then too, with the case of Tandy,
who was unable to play the ma
jority of the season, fresh in his
mind, Warner feels much may hap
pen to a captain-elect before the im
portant games of coming schedule

! are at hand. While the Stanford
mentor had no precedent for his ac
tion, the success of the change will
no doubt be taken into consideration
when the dates for election of future
captains is considered.
During the past year or so, many
universities have adopted the scheme
of having no fixed football captain
elected at all, the coach merely ap
j pointing a captain for each game,
j Such is the method employed at the
University of Southern California,
! used here in the majority of this
season's clashes due to the enforced
absence of Captain Tandy from the
lineup.
Whether Warner plans to do away
| with the election of the captaincy or
not, is unknown, but such an idea
| is thought unlikely. While no defin
, ite date for the election of the new
: leader of the Redshirt gridiron group
lias been set, it is expected that a
I captain will be named within a fort
night after the opening of the 1931
1 football season.
