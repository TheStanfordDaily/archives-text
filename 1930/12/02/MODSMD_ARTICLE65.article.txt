# NOTED GOLF STARS PLAY ON STANFORD LINKS; LAUD COURSE
## 
### 
Stanford saw some good golf and
some famous golfers last Satur
day morning when a foursome made
up by Horton Smith, F. Dudley.
Craig Wood, and Frank Walsh
played the University course.
In the opinion of the four golf
ers the course is five or six strokes

harder than the Interlaken course
where the International Open Cham
pionship was played this year, and
they considered it the best test of
golf on the Pacific coast that they
have played this year.
