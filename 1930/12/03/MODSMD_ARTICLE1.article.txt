# HOOVER URGES CONGRESS TO HELP JOBLESS
## Farm Aid Held Vital Issue As President Seeks Appropriations TAX BOOST IN OFFING 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. (A 3 ).—
President Hoover set unemployment
and drought relief at the top ol the
program for the short session recom
mended today in his message to
Congress.
To accelerate all Federal construc
tion in the next six months, he re
quested an emergency appropriation
up to $150,000,000. The amount for
seed and feed loans to farmers was
left for congressional determination.
Estimating this year's deficit would
reach $180,000,000, he said, "I can
not emphasize too strongly the abso
lute necessity to defer any other
plans for increase of government ex
penditures.
Urges "Itigid Economy"
A surplus of only $30,000,000 is in
sight for 1932, the President warned,
even with discontinuance of the - one
per cent tax reduction on 1929 in
comes. "Rigid economy" was de
clared necessary avoid increase
in taxes."
In addition to the relief enact
ments, he advocated early comple
tion of the following legislation:
Muscle Shoals, motor bus regula
tion, relief of court congestion, bor
der patrol reorganization to prevent
smuggling, and law enforcement in
the national capital.
Evades Prohibition
Neither prohibition nor the work
of the law enforcement commission
was discussed.
Hoover concluded with a reitera
tion of intention to transmit later to
the Senate in a special message, the
revised protocol for American adher
ence to the World Court.
In connection with providing em
ployment, he stated a need for au
thority to tjiake some enlarged tem
porary advances of Federal highway
aid to the states. Another proposal
was that the $150,000,000 appropria
tion be made distributable to the
different departments upon recom
mendation of a Cabinet Committee
and presidential approval.

"Its application to works already
authorized by the Congress assures
its use in directions of economic im
portance and to public welfare," he
wrote. "Such action will imply an
expenditure upon construction of all
kinds of over $050,000,000 during the
next twelve months."
Looking beyond the short session,
the Chief Executive recommended
several questions for congressional
consideration, "perhaps through com
mittees co-operating in some in
stances with the Federal depart
ments, with a view to preparation
for subsequent action."
These included effective regulation
of interstate electrical power; fur
ther legislation necessary to facili
tate railroad consolidation; revision
of immigration laws to place them on
a more limited, selective and flexible
basis; and adjustment of inequalities
in services and allowances to vet-

Looking beyond the short session,
the Chief Executive recommended
several questions for congressional
consideration, "perhaps through com

for subsequent action."
These included effective regulation

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. (A 3 ).—
President Hoover set unemployment
and drought relief at the top ol the
program for the short session recom
mended today in his message to
Congress.
To accelerate all Federal construc
tion in the next six months, he re
quested an emergency appropriation
up to $150,000,000. The amount for
seed and feed loans to farmers was
left for congressional determination.
Estimating this year's deficit would
reach $180,000,000, he said, "I can
not emphasize too strongly the abso
lute necessity to defer any other
plans for increase of government ex
penditures.
Urges "Itigid Economy"
A surplus of only $30,000,000 is in
sight for 1932, the President warned,
even with discontinuance of the - one
per cent tax reduction on 1929 in
comes. "Rigid economy" was de
clared necessary avoid increase
in taxes."
In addition to the relief enact
ments, he advocated early comple
tion of the following legislation:
Muscle Shoals, motor bus regula
tion, relief of court congestion, bor
der patrol reorganization to prevent
smuggling, and law enforcement in
the national capital.
Evades Prohibition
Neither prohibition nor the work
of the law enforcement commission
was discussed.
Hoover concluded with a reitera
tion of intention to transmit later to
the Senate in a special message, the
revised protocol for American adher
ence to the World Court.
In connection with providing em
ployment, he stated a need for au
thority to tjiake some enlarged tem
porary advances of Federal highway
aid to the states. Another proposal
was that the $150,000,000 appropria
tion be made distributable to the
different departments upon recom
mendation of a Cabinet Committee
and presidential approval.
