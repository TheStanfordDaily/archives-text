WASHINGTON, Dcc. 2. (fP)â€”A
new proposal for posthumous re
compense for the victims of the S-4
and S-51 submarine disasters was
before Congress today.
Representative Halsey, Republi
can, Missouri, proposed in a bill to
give $2,500 each to the dependents
of the men who lost their lives. The
S-4 went down off Cape Cod, De
cember 17, J027, with all hands lost.
Two men escaped alive from the
S-51 which was rammed by the
steamer City of Rome.
