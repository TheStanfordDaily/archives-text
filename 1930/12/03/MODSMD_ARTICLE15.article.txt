# DISARMAMENT COMMISSION FINISHES JOB
## Germany's Effort To Set Date For Conference Defeated 14-4 
### 
GENEVA, Doc. 2. (TP)- Completing
j tonight its task of drafting a general
I disarmament scheme for considera
-1 tion by a world conference, the pre
paratory commission invited the
council of the League of Nations to
set a date for this momentous as-
J sembly of statesmen.
By a vote of fourteen to four, with
j numerous abstentions including the
United States, the commission re
jected an effort by Germany to have
the commission recommend the spe
j cifie date of Nov. 5, 1931.
Count von Bernstorff contended
j Nov. 5 would provide ample time to
i prepare.
"Ten months," he cried, "is enough
J time in which to prepare for this
I conference. If ten months is not
| enough, then ten years will not be
j enough."
The German demand for a fixed
] date was backed up by China, Italy,
; Russia, and Bulgaria. But Great
' Britain, France, Czechoslovakia,
I Greece, and Japan vigorously in
j sisted the commission would do well
; not to shoulder the heavy responsi
j bility which they contended bc
i longed only to the League Council.
The amendment leaving it to the
: council to fix the date was offered
â–  by Lord Cecil of Great Britain. The
j general belief in Geneva was that
j the council would select some date
j early in 1932.
j A spirited discussion took place
j at today's session on the use of poi
! son gas in warfare, but it finally
' was decided to leave the matter
j over for the general conference to
| decide.
Two provisions regarding publicity
! for civil aircraft were adopted.
The convention text called for an
j annual report on the number of
. commercial aircraft in each country.
J To this was added tonight a British
j proposal to include in this report
' expenditures on civil craft by gov
| ernments and local authorities and
j a Polish proposal to includc the total
i horsepower of civil craft.
' Ambassador Gibson asked that the
| opposition of the United States be
jannounced in a note appended to
i the article.
Canada lost a fight to delete from
I the article military planes and per
| sonnel used in civil work, such as
! patrolling forests and carrying aid
jto distressed citizens in remote
j places. The Canadian plan was sup
j ported by the United States.
