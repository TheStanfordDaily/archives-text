"The purpose of the International
Relations Clubs is to give interested
persons a chance to get together and
discuss seriously and impartially in
ternational problems," said Miss Amy
Heminway Jones, national secretary
of the International Relations Clubs,
under the Carnegie Endowment,
while speaking before a group of
about 40 persons yesterday noon.
"We have nobody going around
urging people to join, no coaxing.
Only these who arc vitally interested
attend the meetings. Personally, I
think it is a great mistake for the
clubs to become too large and get
'dead wood.' I would consider three
members a club. The only require
ments we make arc that a group get
together regularly and discuss in
telligently, and, that the books sent
out by the Carnegie Endowment be
kept by themselves as a permanent
library.
"The members of these clubs are
able to take an attitude which leads
to friendly relations when they take
their places in the various parts of

I ! the world. This is the only basis on
j which we can hope for permanent
I international peace.
"The clubs arc forums, not social
• gatherings. They may make out
, their own programs of study. On
, j this coast you are particularly in
terested in Pacific problems. On the
Atlantic coast we have other inter
-1 ests."
Miss Jones is now establishing re
l gional conferences in the various
' sections of the United States. Soon
she expects to organize a national
conference, and eventually an inter
national one. The regional confer
ences are really beginnings of an in
ternational one, however, because
delegates from Canada, Hawaii,
Porto Rico, Havana, Mexico and
South America are invited to the
nearest conference meeting. Inter
national Relations Clubs are also be
• ing established in Europe, where the
; universities are very often almost
• international relations clubs in them
; , selves.
