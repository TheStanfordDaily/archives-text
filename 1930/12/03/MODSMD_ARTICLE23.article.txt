# Martin Presents Sketch Of Great South American
## Simon Bolivar Eulogized On Anniversary 
### 
"Simon Bolivar was the greatest
man South America has ever pro
duced, considering the obstacles he
had to face and the difficulties with
which he had to contend," declared
Professor Percy A. Martin in his lec
ture on Bolivar, the famous libera
tor, general, and statesman of South
America, presented last night in the
Little Theatre.
"Neither George Washington nor
Napoleon would have been capable
of such great achievements had they
been compelled to deal with such
unpromising material as the unedu
cated, conglomerate mixture of peo
ple such as were under the command
of Bolivar."
History Keloid
In interpreting the great import
of Bolivar's accomplishments, the
lecturer discussed European history
of the times as a background for the
events that occur in South America.
The situation in the eighteenth cen
tury was ripe for the movements of
discontent and revolt which pre
ceded Bolivar's advent in history.
Bolivar, who was born in Caracas
in 1783, came from a wealthy Vene
zuelan family. After traveling and
studying in Europe for some time,
he returned to his native country,
lircd with the resolution to release
South America from the yoke of
Spanish dominance, and he soon
launched upon his carcer, writing
bombastic literature proposing to
overthrow Spain.
Republics Formed
He succeeded Francisco Miranda
as general of the revolting troops,
and after a few discouraging de
feats, he was able to establish an in
dependent group of republics, con
sisting of Colombia, Venezuela, New
Granada, and the Presidency of
Quito.
After a few years, revolts in Bo
livia, Peru, and Columbia began to
trouble him, and he finally lost con
trol of the major part of his organi
zation, and in 1830, Bolivar died in
almost complete poverty, a broken
and disillusioned man.
Bolivar's final place in the history
of America, stated the lecturer, is
not yet determined. Although at
first he was heralded as a leader of
great moment, later he was consid
ered a disappointment. In recent
years a realization of his difficulties
has come about and he is looked
upon as a vgry admirable hero.
