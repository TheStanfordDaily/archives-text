Approval Withheld
The Executive Committee refused
I to give their official sanction to a
I new Stanford song presented by the
; Rally Committee. The words to the
| song, which is played to the music
| of a recent popular piece, The Vaga
| bond King, were written by Gregory
Dexter. It was turned rV.vn h2cau.se
j of the lack of originality of the tune,
I which, it was argued, is used by
; both Harvard and West Point.
The student legislative body also
I declined to accept the minutes of
| the Rally Committee meeting of De
-1 cembcr 1, returning them to that
j committee for revisal. A motion in—
I eluded in these minutes authorized
| a reimbursement of $3 to each of
, the members of the committee for
the private purchase of their Rally
Committee sweaters earlier in the
year, when it was felt that the
A.S.S.U. budget; allowed the body
was not sufficient to cover this ex
pense.
Since a considerable surplus re
mained after the conclusion of the
Rally Committee's operations this
j quarter, that body rescinded its pre
| vious decision and asked for a re
imbursement to its members. Ex
Committee turned down Ihc peti
tion on the assertion that previous
Rally Committee members have paid
for their own sweaters for the last
I several years.
