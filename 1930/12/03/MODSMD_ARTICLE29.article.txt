Amateur boxing makes its tall delmt on the I "arm tonight with
15 1 xmts scheduled on the program of the annual novice tourna
ment.

The amateur sport i< a manly game, and is far removed from the
-ordidness of professional pugilism.
The novice tournament is held each year with the idea of giving
newcomers an opportunity in the ring, and to develop new material
for the varsity squad. Many of the finest campus hoxcrs first tasted
leather in a novice tourney.
Stanford's intercollegiate record is an enviable one; both as to
victories, and to the gentlemanly manner in which Stanford partici
pants and spectators have conducted themselves. •
Much of the popularity and prestige of boxing- on this campus is
due to Marry Malonev, and his able assistant. Mvron Schall. These
two sportsmen have proved that boxing is a clean sport.
