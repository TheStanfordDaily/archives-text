The Daily's editorial yesterday morning urging students to sup
port the second offering of the A.S.S.I*. Concert Series was a hit
previous, in fact, it was _ , 4 hours too soon.
I he editorial declared the concert would he offered tonight in
the Pavilion—instead it's tomorrow night in the Pavilion.
Remember, Klisaheth Rethherg, noted soprano of the Metropoli
tan Opera Company, will give the second concert of the series tn
morrow night. This is correct !
