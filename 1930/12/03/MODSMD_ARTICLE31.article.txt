# MAYBE WILL WAS RIGHT

Will Rogers i> a first class humorist, the Stin I rancisco Chroniclc
admits, hut us an economist? Well, that's different. Will said sonic
thing no! so long ago ahout saving money. The Chronicle doesn't
like Will's idea.
Sd he is honored with an editorial, acknowledging his ability as (
a humorist but not a-* an economist, declaring that in the latter role
Ile is "X.(i." .
"The principal trouble with the country todav." the Chrnnicfc '
remarks, "is that people are not spending enough. They are buying
just what the\ absolutely must have and no more. Tliev are doing i
just what Will says they ought to do hanging on to every cent they
Mill . . . The great majority of money put in circulation conies from
the middle and lower classes, because of their vast Iv greater number." :
< Iranted that stimulated buying would mean the end of the present â€¢
depression, why urge the middle and lower classes to spend when
they know that their present jobs are uncertain? Why urge them to
risk having "to hold the sack" as did the many who did their spend
ing before the depression and had no reserve funds to live on when
they lost their jobs?
Maybe Will Rogers wasn't speaking out of turn too much when
he recommended a little economy and caution in this matter of spend
iug money to speed up business.
