What should he the function of a college paper? To lead or to
follow? To represent adequately both sides and then to espouse the;
majority view? To he completely neutral? To he independent and
try to stimulate its readers rather than to he an organ of the status
quo ?
I here is a great deal to he said for all these functions. The ques
tion i- by no means settled. Hut it seems often to work best if the!
editorial column tries only to make its readers think.
If the editorial policy tries to represent the majority, how can'
it tell what the majority is? ()n any controversial question, for ex- j
ample. iu>t how do the students stand? Very generally they don't i
stand. They fall. Instead of their having any organized, intelligent
opinion, they have bundles of prejudices or absences of thought. A
college paper should trv to get them to consider certain questions: j
and if it does that, having faith in democracy, it may trust its readers
to work things out for themselves in a comparatively intelligent
fashion.
If the editorial policy is to follow, the paper is colorless, and no |
one reads it. If it represents one side only, it must neglect others. If
it espouses the majority, it is liable to forget minority rights. The
only practicable policy left is to consider itself a stimulus and that
only.—Daily Kmisnti. j
