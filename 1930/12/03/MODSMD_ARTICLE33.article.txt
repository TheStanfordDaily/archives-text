THE I2M> PARALLEL. By John
Don Pasos. New York: Harper
& Brothers. 1930.
Dos Pasos is widely known as the
author of "Manhattan Transfer," Sin
clair Lewis' ideal of the American
novel. In his most recent book Dos
Pasos has gone even farther in his
quest of photographic realism.
He has, apparently, done every
thing he could imagine in this effort
al reality. The characters bear a
very slight relation to each other,
and the author turns from one to
another without any particular rea
son.
Moreover, Dos Pasos intersperses
sections consisting of newspaper
headlines of the time and bits from
popular songs.
That does not imply that "42nd
Parallel" is not interesting. It does
I imply that it may be of some
value to the man of the future who
tries to understand the early decades
of this century; though the book
does, of necessity, lack the accuracy
of modern science. But "The 42nd

| Parallel" is no more literature than
1 a railway time table. —E. E. W.
i J
| lIULLABALOt). By Peter Arno.
Horace Liveright, Inc. New
York. 1930. (At Stanford Book
store. $3.00).
Readers of (he "New Yorker"
know what to expect of Peter Arno's
drawings. They will not b9 disap
pointed by the collection in "Hulla
baloo."
The sketches are delightfully hu
morous and they require, at most,
a half dozen words as a caption to
explain the point of the jest. It may
bell be said that Arno is presenting
a novel and significant addition to
American comedy; at any rate, the
book is very amusing.
The book also contains a scholarly
introduction entitled, "A Note on
Pictorial Humor," by Robert Bench
ley, in which the decline of the old
"he and she" joke is described and
Arno is hailed as the savior of
American comic magazines.

Horace Liveright, Inc. New
York. 1930. (At Stanford Book
store. $3.00).
Readers of (he "New Yorker"
know what to expect of Peter Arno's
drawings. They will not b9 disap
pointed by the collection in "Hulla
baloo."
The sketches are delightfully hu
morous and they require, at most,
a half dozen words as a caption to
explain the point of the jest. It may
bell be said that Arno is presenting
a novel and significant addition to
American comedy; at any rate, the
book is very amusing.
The book also contains a scholarly
introduction entitled, "A Note on
Pictorial Humor," by Robert Bench
ley, in which the decline of the old
"he and she" joke is described and
Arno is hailed as the savior of
American comic magazines.
