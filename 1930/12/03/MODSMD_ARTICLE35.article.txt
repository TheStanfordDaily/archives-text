# LOOKING AROUND
## By Abe Mellinkoff

It is getting harder and harder to
lead the good life. First came the j
movies, and then came rumble seats, j
and now road-houses near the Uni
versity of Colorado are paying the
taxi fares for students to their es- |
tablishments.
The major difficulty in speaking
about the good life is that nobody j
agrees what virtue is. In literature,
for example, ancient Athens be- j
lieved that trueness to life was mor
ality in books while modern Boston
seems to think that trueness to Mid- j
Victorian idealism is the desirable
in printed material.
Vassal* prints an article entitled, :
"When Is a Lady Not a Lady?" ;
Chewing gum is listed as one of
fense against social good taste.
And another custom that falls
in the same class is "making up"
in public. Before entering the
theatre, before each intermis
sion, and before entering and
leaving the safe are all usual
! moments for makeup.
No one will deny that Fuller's !
paints and Louis Phillipe lip stick
make the country beautiful. No one j
will deny that spinach and rouge |
give the nation rosy cheeks.
But what one-half of the j
i population wants to know is ;
why the other half persists in j
continually reminding them that ;
amorous eyes, seductive lashes,
inviting lips, cheerful checks,
and (he skin you love to touch
arc all as artificial as a 25-cent
print of the "Blue Boy."
Besides football, cheating in ex- I
animations is the most serious and
persistent problem on the under- !
graduate's mind from Dartmouth to ;
Stanford, from University of Brit- ;
ish Columbia to Florida. Many col- |
i leges have the honor system; many j
use the proctor method.
The University of Chicago has just j
initiated a "lie-detector" machine io 1
show whether or not students cheat.
