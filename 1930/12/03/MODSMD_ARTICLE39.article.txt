# ELECTRIC EXTENSION MADE UNDERGROUND TO NEW GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Streets, and ground surrounding
the Press building, are now in a
state of upheaval due to the instal
i lation of new underground electric i
systems in that vicinity.
These new lines are to connect !
i with the new Roble gymnasium that i
| is rapidly nearing completion. It
j was necessary to dig a ditch some j
! 300 feet long in order to connect |
: (he new gym with the regular elec- j
â–  trie system just south of the Press
'' building.
All of this work is being done by j
| the regular employees of the Uni
! versity corporation yard. An air
' compressor, and equipment from the j
' yard, has done much to speed up
' the work.
Two or three days more will see i
I the end of the necessary street work, ;
i and the partially blocked roads will I
i again be clear.
