# ENGLAND FEARS STRIKE SPREAD
## Glasgow Miners Decide To Continue Strike 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 2. (/Pj.â€”Fear ran
high tonight that the strike in the
Scottish coal fields will spread
throughout the coal fields of Great
1 Britain.
"Scotland cannot be left alone in
the struggle," said A. J. Cook, pow
erful secretary of the Miners' Feder
ation.
1 His statement was made after re
ceipt of word from Glasgow that at
a conference of miners' leaders it
was decided the strike should con
tinue. Another disquieting fact was
that delegates from Ayrshire, where
the men have continued at work,
promised to endeavor to bring the
miners in their area in line with the
strikers.
The next important step in the sit
uation as a whole is expected Thurs
day when a conference of national
1 union delegates meets in London. At
the Glasgow meeting it was voted to
place the position of the Scottish
miners before the conference.
Cook expressed the opinion that
before a national general strike could
be called a vote would have to be
taken of all mine workers in the
British coal fields.
The principal point of issue is the
hours of work, the miners objecting
to the proposition of the owners that
a 90-hour fortnight go into effect.
They demand a fiat seven and one
half hour day. The owners contend
, the only alternative to the 90-hour,
spreadover system, is a reduction in
wages.
