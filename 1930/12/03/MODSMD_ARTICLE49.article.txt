# INVENTION RENDERS GREAT ECONOMY IN NATION'S FUEL BILL
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Dec. 2. (/P>—Out of
the death of an airplane pilot in I
1928 has come a device which its
inventor claims will eliminate car
bon monoxide fumes from gasoline
engines and save more than $1,000,- i
000,000 annually in the nation's fuel
, bills.
Dr. Miller Reese Hutchison, chief
engineer for Thomas A. Edison from
1909 to 1918 and originator of the
klaxon and the acousticon, demon
strated the invention yesterday be
fore Captain Frank M. Hawks, fly -
, ing speed king, and others.
The instrument, known as the
"moto-vita," was developed primar-
I ily to increase the efficiency and
flight range of airplanes as there
; suit of the accidental death of Dr.
j Hutchison's son, Harold, an airplane ,
i pilot. It employs the principle of
catalysis to prevent the waste of
fuel through improper carburet ion
| and imperfect combustion.
The "moto-vita," as exhibited by
| the inventor, weighs about a pound
and a half and can be produced at a
■ nominal cost. It consists of a thermo
; couplet "bridge" of platinum and
nickel wires so attached to the motor
' that the gases constantly pass over
| it, recording automatically the per
| centage of unburned gases escaping
and enabling the driver to increase
| the quantity of air in the fuel mix- !
! ture.
