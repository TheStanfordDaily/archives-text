## ALL-AMERICANITIS 
### 
Since the last shovelfull of earth
ies waiting beside football's grave,
ports writers throughout the length
ind breadth of this fair land are
illing their columns with all-Coast,
ill-American, and all-This-and
rhat football teams. Every Decern
jer finds u similar epidemic sweep
ing the country.
Walter Camp started the whole
ness. Back in the '90's, Walter be
!;iii to pick his choice of football
nen from the nation's teams—which
laturally meant Yale, Harvard, and
i'rinceton. As time passed, the game
■xpanded and Waiter's selections
.pread with it until finally once in a
jreat while he had a man from Cor
ii-11 or Dartmouth on the team.
Finally even Eastern distinctions
*•11 before the growth of the pas
ime, and grid stars from California
uegan to see their names on the
:oveted mythical eleven. But Camp
jassed to his reward, and the field
)i official All-American picker lan
guished, although hundreds strove
to replace the lather of American
foot ball.
Now the chief drawback to picking
til-star aggregations is two-fold. In
the first place, no one man or group
if men between them can see every
rm Islanding man play every game
ill season. And in the second place,
;i man's play may vary considerably
one week-end and the next. So there
has been, and justly, much criticism
of attempts to pick outstanding
football men.
We will not attempt to pick an
All-American team, contrary to the
privilege of all sports scribes. In
fact, we will not even attempt to
select an All-Coast team, for we
have not seen Oregon, Washington
State, U.C.L.A., and others ploy
football, so it would be a grave in
justice to attempt to rate football
players on the basis of press clip
pings. There are entirely too many
Brick Morse's about to do that.
But—we will pick an All-Oppon
ent team on the basis of the teams
we have seen play Stanford here in
our own backyard, or nearby in the
Berkeley Memorial Stadium. Army,
Olympic Club, Santa Clara, Oregon
State, U.S.C., Washington, Califor
nia, and Dartmouth have paraded
before our incompetent orbs, and
we'll pick 'em as we saw 'em.
Here they are:
Ends: Arbelbide of Southern Cali
fornia and McKalip of Oregon State;
tackles: Hall of Southern California
\nd Schwegler of Washington;
guards: Baker of Southern Califor
ii:\ and Bcckett of California; cen
!er: Kimball of Dartmouth: quarter
jack: Mohler of Southern California;
lull'backs: Morton of Dartmouth and
'inckert of Southern California;
"ullback: Musick of Southern Cali
ornia.
That team includes six Trojans,
uul since the Trojans won by a
score—well, anyway -we were quite
mprcssed with the playing of
Southern California, which accounts
or their numerical strength 011 Our
Feam. On the whole, it is a fairly
•epresentative group, with Mohler
getting the call over DulTield be
•ause we think he showed more in
he Stanford game.
To make matters more personal,
lowever, we will pick an All-Seen
earn. Since we have seen Stanford i
novo or less all season, we can in
lude some local products on that ;
>utfit. We were also fortunate '
nough to see the California-Saint
Gary's College game this year,
vhich makes St. Mary's men eli- !
;ible, too.
Our All-Seen team is the same as
he All-Opponents team with two
•xccptions—Moffatt replaces Morton
it halfback and Kothert replaces
ilu.dck at full. 111 case anyone wants
o know where the St. Mary's men 112
ire, another glance should suffice,
alifornia beat the Gaels and Gauls,
nd on the basis of that game, no
it. Mary's man can play on my
cam. N'est-ce pas? —L. K., Jr.
