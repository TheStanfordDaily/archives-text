Delts Held
Until the speedy, swerving, (!0-
yard run of Twelvetrees piercet
their defense, the Theta Chi's hole
1 iin edge over the Delta Tau Delt<
seven. Not only had they held ir
1 check the fast Delt backfield, made
up of past and present Stanforc
track stars, but three times the}
made sustained drives into scoring
territory through their varied, baf
filing passing attack, in which Zugei
and Howe played major roles. Onct
inside the 10-yard line, goal lint
hysteria and a tight defense nulli
fied the drives.
Receiving the first kick-off, Sigmr
Chi started a touchdown drive dowi
j the field, engineered by Kelly anc
Joujon-Roche, the former running
the ends and passing, the latter re
ceiving. After scoring the touch
down but not the conversion, the>
forced Sigma Nu to kick and started
another drive. The entire half was
the same story. Sigma Chi attacked
constantly and gave the Sigma Nu's
no chance to exhibit an offense.
Deuel Stars
In the second period Deuel of
Sigma Nu swung into action as his
team got the ball in safe territory
for the first time. Showing â€¢ great
\ speed and a fine cut-back ability,
he rounded the ends eight times
and scored two touchdowns, almost
making a third. A place kick failed
to convert the first extra point try,
and Deuel was smothered by the
i Sigma Chi line on his try for the
second conversion. This left the
| score 13-12 with four minutes to
play. At the end of the four minutes
the score was unchanged, as the
; Sigma Chi's received the kick-off
and kept the ball.
Deuel's ball carrying was the fin
est piece of individual work of the
1 tournament. Almost unaided by in
terference, he scored two touch
downs and kept his team in the
running. Only fine work by Jojon-
Roche, Sigma Chi safety man, kept
him from winning the game.
A.K.L. Wins
Phi Sigma Kappa played a fine
defensive game to hold the A.K.L.'s
scoreless during the regular playing
time. A 15-yard penalty against the
A.K.L.'s, when they had the ball
on the five-yard line was a great
help. To settle the contest the ball
was placed in the middle of the
field, and each team ran five alter
nate plays.
At the end of that time the pig
skin was deep in Phi Sig territory,
which gave the A.K.L.'s their sev
enth straight victory, 2-0. Marple
of the victors was outstanding as
usual, his clever running being the
A.K.L.'s chief attacking weapon.
