# COMPETITORS NEED MEDICAL APPROVAL FOR CLASS GAMES
## 
### 
Men who have not received per
mission from the medical depart- â– 
ment to participate in the coming
interclass basketball competition had ,
best do so at once, according to
, Parker Reed, student director of in- i
tramural athletics. The regular time
, set aside for the examinations has i
| passed but individual appointments j
j may be made for today and tomor
j row. No one will be allowed to com
pete without the medical depart
ment's approval.
The chances of the freshman team
appear good because members of
the frosh cage squad will be able to j
I play for their class. However, the !
seniors have assembled a strong ag
gregation from among men not out
for the varsity and they are ex- i
pected to give the babes plenty of <
competition.
1 Encina Gym will be the scene of
j the first encounters which will take j
place Thursday night. The junior
senior clash is scheduled for 7
o'clock and the freshmen and sopho
mores for 8 o'clock.
