# BABE CAGE OUTFIT DEVELOPING TOUCH OFFENSIVE ATTACK
## 
### 
If present developments are fruit
ful, the Cardinal Babe cage outfit
will present an offense worthy to be
feared by the 14 teams on its sched
ule this year. According to Coach
John Bunn, the first-year squad
boasts of four men all well above
six feet in height, and he is endeav
oring to build up an attack based
on their control of the tip-off.
In Kuechler, Topping, Packard,
and Jenkins, Coach Bunn has a
group that averages considerably
taller than men on any freshman
squad in recent years and he is con
fident that from them and other
members of the team a strong of
fensive combination can be de
veloped.
At present the team is going
through stiff workouts every after
noon between 2 and 4 o'clock in
anticipation of their first game to
be played with the St. Mary's year
lings on January 2.
