# LABOR MOTION FAILS IN HOUSE OF LORDS
## 
### 
I LONDON, Dec. 2. (/Phâ€”The Mac-
I Donald government was defeated in
the House of Lords tonight when a
i conservative criticism of the conduct
of the Imperial Conference was car
ried by a vote of 74 to 10. The de
feat has no political significance,
however, since the small number of
Labor peers in the upper house
makes such incidents of fairly fre
quent occurrence.
