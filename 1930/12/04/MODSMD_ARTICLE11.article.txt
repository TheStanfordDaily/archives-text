# RULE CHANGES ARE TAKEN UP BY CONFERENCE
## Women's New Late Leave Regulations Surveyed By A.W.S. Group 
### 
Three main points in the present
i late-leave regulations which were
; considered for change by A.W.S.
i Conference last night and which
I were left to be drawn up in the
1 student regulations committee and
1 presented at a Conference meeting
next Wednesday are:
1. Advisability of limiting the
1 number of 2:30 o'clock leaves which |
can be taken by freshmen and new
women. .)
2. Statement to be made as to ,
whether the 2:30 o'clock leaves can
be taken only for San Francisco or
whether they are equally applicable
to places which are approximately
an hour's distance from the living
group.
3. Advisability of having a mid
week leave for cultural events in |
l San Francisco, either 1:30 or 2:30
o'clock.
Several Violations
The probable necessity of limiting
: the new women in 2:30 o'clock leaves
was brought out in the reports of
the groups studying the situation,
I and several violations or excess
i number of late-leaves were reported.
Criticism in regard to the exces
) sive number of checks and red tape
was given in the report from Council
i and it was pointed out that not only
is there a check by this body but
( also checks by the house-presidents,
Dean Yost, Dr. Dyment, Miss Doyle
, and all the lockout books.
Approval In Houses
In the report from the joint com
mittee of students, administration,
! and housemothers, definite approval
of the new rules was indicated by
the house mothers with the possible
exception of the key system. Miss
Doyle, Koble house director, was
i not so satisfied with the regulations
among the new women at the hall.
The report from the health and
i scholarship committee stated that
i the new rules have not noticeably
affected the health of the living
groups and only in individual cases
where an excess of late-leaves have
been taken, has there been any un
! satisfactory result.
The work of this committee is re
i stricted to mid-week privileges, and
; it can act only in an advisory ca
pacity for week-end late leaves.
Most of the work is done with ex
ceptional cases only, according to
the report.
Consensus of opinion in all the
I reports was that there had not been
enough time to obtain many work
ing statistics and that suggestions
could be made only in a few cases.
1 If changes are made next week,
there will be no further change in
the rules throughout the trial year,
it was agreed.
