# NEGLIGENCE CHARGED BY CITY CHIEF
## Christianson Accident Due To Railroad s Lack Of Protection 
### 
A mother and her daughter lie
dead this morning. A grieved hus
band and father alone remains of a
happy family of three —all because
of "heartless delay and devious red
tape."
Such was the charge made against
the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany by Pali) Alto's Mayor C. H.
Christensen as a result of the
Churchill avenue crossing accident
yesterday morning when Mrs. Rose
M. Christianson, 25, and her daugh
ter, Betty Jane, 7, met their deaths
under the mangling wheels of a
train.
The Christiansons lived at 112
Mariposa avenue, Palo Alto.
Mayor Christensen declared the
railroad company had no excuse for
its delay to provide an adequate
crossing in Palo Alto.
Mrs. Christianson and her daugh
ter were killed instantly when they
were struck by the northbound
Lark at 8:40 o'clock. The bodies of
the mother and child were hurled
from the car and carried nearly 200
feet by the locomotive. Mrs. Chris
tianson's body was horribly decapi
tated.
Nearly Clears Train
According to witnesses of the ac
cident, Mrs. Christianson brought
the car to a stop at the crossing to
allow a southbound train to pass.
She then proceeded across the
tracks, apparently failing to see the
northbound train. Her car, nearly
clearing the track, was hit on the
right rear end.
The news of these two latest fa
talities aroused widespread indigna
tion and condemnation of the South
' ern Pacific Company in Palo Alto.
Crossing Campaign Reviewed
j In a statement issued following
i the collision Mayor Christensen re
| viewed the long campaign which the
I city has carried on to secure pro-
I tection at the crossing, since the
i death there of T. D. Dollings about
j five years ago.
I According to Christensen the city's
| efforts have met "opposition., by de
i vious and red tape tactu® set up
only to delay and block action for
j the protection of human life."
