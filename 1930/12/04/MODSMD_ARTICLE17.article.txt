# TICKET SELLER IS BLACKLISTED BY B.A.C. ORDER
## Arthur R. Adams Penalized For Scalping Big Game Rooter's Ticket 
### 
For scalping a Big Game rooter's
ticket, Arthur R. Adams, Stanford
student registered from Los Angeles,
yesterday was placed on the ticket
blacklist by the Board of Athletic
Control for an indefinite period.
The action followed a decision of
Men's Council at a special meeting
yesterday afternoon, the BA.C. re
ported, in which the council gave
Adams the option of being assessed
$5 or of being blacklisted. Adams
chose to be blacklisted, and the
council turned the matter over to
the B.A.C.
U.S.C. Transfer
Adams, who is a transfer from the
University of Southern California,
and who declared he would gradu
ate from Stanford in June, was said
by the board to have told the coun
cil that he owed his allegiance to
U.S.C. and not to Stanford, and that
it made no difference to him whether
he was placed on the blacklist or
not.
While the ticket which Adams
sold was declared to have been his
roommate's, Adams explained that
the other man was not responsible
for the ticket sale. It had been sold
to a clerk in a Palo Alto cigar store.
Other Cases Discussed
Two other cases were reported by
the B.A.C. as having been discussed
by the council. One was dismissed
because of lack of evidence, and the
other was continued because a sum
mons had not been served on the
student.
Women's Council, at a meeting
this afternoon, will pass judgment
on two woman students accused of
transfering their Dartmouth rooters'
tickets.
Yesterday's action is in line with
the determination of the Rally Com
mittee to clear the Stanford rooting
section of undesirable non-students
who were alleged to have created
offensive disturbances, giving an
unjust impression of Stanford stand
ards of conduct.
