# $1000 SET AS GOAL TO BE REACHED AT FRIDAY'S CARNIVAL
## 
### 
A profit of $1000 is the aim of
Stanford women who are now com
pleting preparations for the All-
University carnival to be held in
the Pavilion at 8 o'clock tomorrow
night.
Donations from the campus living
groups and Palo Alto merchants
have reduced the cost of running
concessions and providing refresh
ments. The Carnival orchestra, un
der the direction of Herbert Shapiro,
is playing free of charge for the
dancing; women's living groups are
donating candy; and Wilson's is giv
ing a five pound box of sweets for
the prize in the lucky drawing con
test.
Ice cream will be provided by the
Roble dining room, cake by Eneina,
and punch by the Union. The Cor
poration Yard has loaned lumber for
the booths and given nails, wood,
and hammers for the nail-pounding
concession.
Other booths will h;*e apparatus
to test the skill of entrants in basket
ball throwing, ping pong, bowling,
and archery. Girls will also be pre
pared to tell fortunes by palmistry,
handwriting, cards, numbers, and
crystal gazing.
Perhaps the most profitable con
cession will be the lea garden in
which senior girls, dressed in loung
ing pajamas, will serve cake, sand
wiches, tea, coffee, punch, and ice
cream.
An entrance price of 10 cents is to
be charged, and separate admission
fees to each booth.
