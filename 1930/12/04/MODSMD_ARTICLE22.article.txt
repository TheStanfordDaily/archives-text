"Revolutions usually come not
when conditions arc worst, but when
people become educated enough to
see that conditions can be im
proved," said Professor Raymond
Garfield Gettell, head of the political
science department at the University
of California, in speaking on the
revolution in India before a gather
ing in the Palo Alto Women's Club
House last night.
'The revolutions in China and
India have been given a great im
petus by a group of young men edu
cated in the West. Ghandi himself
is a graduate of the University of
London.
"And it is noticeable that the peo
ple who start them almost never
finish them. The revolutions get out
of their control, and a group of fan
atics is very likely to take things
over."

To illustrate, he continued: "The
revolution in Russia was not started
by the Bolsheviks, but by moder

"Revolutions arise very easily in
India because of the tremendous
diversity of races, religions, and lan
guages. There is no unity. Life is
largely local and isolated. In addi
tion, the people are divided into
ironbound castes.

"Ghandi is for peaceful revolution.
He teaches his people that they
should not obey England, or co
operate with England, but should
not resist her. Ghandi's chief ob
jections to English rule are the high
cost of the government and high
taxes, the fact that England has dis
armed India, has not been as en
thusiastic as she might be in putting
down the opium trade, has kept
India agricultural in order to have
a market for her manufactures, and
assumes superiority."
