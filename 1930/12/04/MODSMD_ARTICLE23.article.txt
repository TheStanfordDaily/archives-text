# STANFORD DEBATERS TELL DISADVANTAGE OF JUNIOR COLLEGE
## 
### 
Stanford women debaters upheld
the affirmative of the question, "Re
solved, that an individual should not
go to junior college in preparation
for further work in a university"
in a non-decision debate with the
University of California varsity
women's debating team last night in
the Little Theatre.
The Stanford speakers, Mary
Catherine Morris and Esther Kelley,
contended that, a four-year univer
sity affords a better all-around edu
cation.
The California team, Mary Shum
ard and Margaret Ward, maintained
that a junior college makes the
transition from high school to col
lege .methods easier, that a junior
college is less expensive, and that
the statistics show that transfers
from junior colleges do better at
Stanford during the third and fourth
years than do Ihe students who
spend the first two years here.
The Stanford team refuted the last
claim by pointing out that the 2
per cent better scholarship was not
enough to compensate for the dis
advantages of a junior college.
The same subject will be debated
tonight at Berkeley by other teams
representing the same universities.
In Ihis debate Stanford will take
the negative, Margaret Strong and
Marlon PJced being the traveling
team.
