# THE 						LATE LEAVES HAVE WE WITH US ALWAYS

I url 1 icr revisions in tlu- women's lockout regulations are again
before Women's Conference. Whether or not llie administration
will ;;rant a permanent installation of the new system will depend
largelv on the wisdom with which the women deal with yesterday's
proposals.
That mid-week two thirty leaves for freshmen women should
he limited seems obvious. Mature judgment is essential in the mat
te:" of the two-thirt\ privilege: and the hysteria of a first away
from home almost precludes that the average first-year woman
would have such judgment.
Interpretation of the applicability of two-thirty leaves to places
other than San Krancisco is extremely necessary. The difficulties
likelv to develop nut of the vague understanding of this rule demand
a definite stand from C onference â€”preferably a thirty mile radius
within which only a stated list of places would receive the two
thirty privilege.
