THE RECTOR'S DAUGHTER. By
F. M. Mayor. Coward-McCor
niack, New York. 1930. (.At tlie
Palo Alio Book Shop.)
As the first of Miss Mayor'u novels
to be published in America,"The
Rector's Daughter" is an admirable
introduction. There is a fineness of
quality, of full sympathetic under
standing of the pathetically valiant,
middle-aged character in the small
parish of Dedmayne.
Mary is not understood by her
friends, in fact she has few friends
until after she passes through a
tragedy that she conceals from
everyone, but she does not miss
that noM-comprehension. Only after
her death, when a letter, the one
love letter of her life, is discovered,
do one or two fully realize that her
spinsterhood had hidden a great
love.
There are weak points in the
book, probably because its subject
is compressed to lit one volume. Mr.
Herbert, who loved Mary, does not
receive enough space to allow com
plete appreciation of his character.
Implications which attract interest
and bother the reader are not ex
plained.
Despite these slight drawbacks,
the delicate treatment and essential
sincerity keep the book in the
reader's mind long after its last
page is finished, and that reader will
undoubtedly wail with interest for
a second of Miss Mayor's novels.

THE IJFE OF THE VAR'IJY. A< the
Varsity Theatre.
Gold-diggers in Havana, with

gorgeous, stolen clothes, and not a
cent in the world, are Winnie Light -
ner and her friend. And they "get
their men," at the last moment,
when the police are about to" require
their presence elsewhere.
One of the victims is really too
good, especially for such unscrupul
ous idiots. But he seems happy, and
Flo is good-looking. Winnie's future
husband finally remembers thai he
loved her when he Jirst saw her,
and since he is seldom home, wants
to marry her. He owns racehorses,
one of which Winnie rides in a
race, to save her bet after the indis
creet jockey is temporarily indis
posed, a short time before the race.
Winnie Lightner sings only one
song, and at ihe end of the picture
you are even reduced to wishing
she had spent more time singing.

FEET FIRST—At the New tSanfon!
Tli eat re.
A screaming comedy—truly that
can be said of "Feel First" without
exaggeration. Harold Lloyd is back
again in a new picture, but with
the same old ability to put over the
laughs.
If you like to see people hang by
the skin of their teeth over the sides
of skyscrapers, and go through one
crazy escapade after another, then
see "Feet First"—it satisfies.
Although one is bound to remem
ber that other picture of Harold
Lloyd's, "Safety Last," still "Feet
First" has gained enough through
the addition of sound and a lot of
hilarious thrills to be a thoroughly
entertaining picture. —C. H.
