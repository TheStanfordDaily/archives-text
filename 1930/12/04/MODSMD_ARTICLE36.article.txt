The University of Wisconsin has
initiated a time-card system to re
cord the number of hours students
spend in study—a plan similar to
that used in department stores to
j check clerks.
This as well as other business
measures adopted by universities no
doubt adds to the efficiency but
i surely detracts from the pleasure
i and value of education.
Perhaps, if production was not
so severely watched, the gradu
ating student's mind would he
an original organism rather than
a mechanized compartment for
the absorption and repetition of
stereotyped facts.
The editor at the University of
; Glasgow remarks than co-eds are an
' inconvenience to real students.
Yes, but the editor will no doubt
be forced to (joncede that they are
: surely a pleasurable bother. Their
happy, smiling faces, and gay
i colored frocks lend a holiday note
to the drab reality of higher educa
tion.
And is it not true that their
naive curiosity about life, life
with a capital "I-."' is a welcome
diversion from the morbidness
and scientific analysis of mod
ern philosophy?
From McGill, one learns that edu
: cation should train personality. How
can train this quality, when
1 no one seems to know what it is?
Most people agree that Elinor
Glynn's concept of this elusive thing
as exemplified in Clara Bow went
out of style in 1924.
i Surely modern sophistication,
which includes wearing smart out
fits, reading Vanity Fair and all sex
novels, and swearing at the slightest
provocation, is not true personality.
It may he hy not trying to
develop this unknown some
thing: hy just being outwardly
what we are inwardly, that we
shall conic closer to exhibiting
personality than by copying
what the majority thinks it
thinks is personality.
