WHY A CAPTAIN?
Throughout the majority of the
ootball clashes this season, the
Stanford team has played without
he services of its captain—Ray
Tandy. Individually, the loss of
f'andy was considerable, for had Ihe
,'ardinal leader's knee not been in
ured, all-coast lists would have in
luded his name at the right tackle
JOSt.
As an inspiration, the loss of the
{cdshirl leader was likewise a han
.i*up. With the fiery personality of
tluller fresh in the memories of the
Indents, the lack of a true spark
dug for the team was noticeable
vlien Tandy remained en the bench.
Ihat hiss was in part compensated
or by the appointment of acting
aptains.
Why not continue the system of
ippointing a captain for each game?
Tjie idea has been tried by many
jther colleges and universities with
ucces^ —and now that the ice has
jcen broken here at Stanford, why
iot keep up the innovation?
The idea behind the post of cap
ain is to choose a leader for the
earn. Hut many problems arise
here—suppose the captain is in
ured, and cannot play in the im
lortant games? Suppose there is no
mtstauding map for the job?
As a solution to these and other
iioblems which may surround the
•hoice of captains, the system of
laving acting leaders seems ideal,
n the first place, if an outstanding
nan is available, his reappointment
0 the leadership for the important
allies would be most natural.
If, 011 the other hand, there is no
ingle outstanding leader available,
good solution is offered. B> giving
ach of the outstanding players on
he team an opportunity to act as
aplain, all would be placed on a
noting of equality, thus stimulating
1 co-operative feeling among the
layers.
Perhaps the only objection to this
iot hod of choosing leaders is that
I places too much power in the
tands of the coach. A second glance
t the position of the coach and his
elation to his teams will be sufTi
ient to quash this argument.
In the first place, the coach likes
<#. win, just as do the men who play
oothall. And on that account, the
oach of a team will not risk the
ppearance of partiality in the se
lection of a captain, for such in
ustice would lose the support of the
ion under him.
One of the greatest assets the svs
om of having acting captains can
iresent is the fact that no longer
v'ould one man, the captain, be
ingled out for the cheers of the
uiltitude. Stars would naturally re
cive their share of praise, but the
lory a man receives simply because
e has been honored by his fellow
layers would be eliminated.
To go on with arguments in favor
I the scheme—it would eliminate
lie process now in vogue of having
icn who will not return for the
ext season's games name the cap
iin for the other players. After all.
lie men who will play under the
ew leader should have the entire
ay as to who shall be captain.
Publicizing an already too-oub
cized topic—one which has been
rought up often without any basis
the fact that elections of captains
nnetimes lead to the formation of
liques, one supporting the winning
andidate, the other the losing man
such possibilities would be elimi
ated with appointed captains.
And with the elimination of one
112 the campus gods—the football
:iptain famous in moving pictures
nd novels—team-play would be en
mi raged. What do you think of the
heme? We vote for it.
