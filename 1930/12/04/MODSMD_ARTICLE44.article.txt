# Cagemen In Last Lap Of Pre-Season Practice
## BUNN HAS THREE WEEKS TO MAKE FINAL SELECTION Coach Experimenting With Varied Combinations; Time Limited 
### Stewart Crawford 
With the varsity basketball squad
cut to the thirty men who will re
main on it throughout the season,
Coach Bunn today settled down to
the business of selecting fnom this
group a quintet to start in the first
game, scarcely three weeks hence.
Though the Cardinal cage men
have yet to perfect the fundament
als of the unfamiliar style of play
taught by the new coach, Bunn will
be forced to hurry the first-string
selection, and proceed with the of
fensive work with a combination
practiced in working together.
Takes Time
The ex-Kansas coach realizes ihat
il takes more than a month, or even
a season to introduce effectively to
a group of basketball men a style
different from one they have played
for years. Though Bunn would wel
come more time to devote to funda
mentals, team play will have to pro
ceed rapidly enough to allow Stan
ford to put a team on the floor in
less than a month.
Yesterday's practice was devoted
to .scrimmages giving the offensive
five the ball in mid-floor, and let
ting them work against the defens
ive squad until the attacking men
scored or lost possession of the ball.
Shifts Men
Throughout, Bunn shifted his men
around, trying one combination and
then another. Besides drilling team
work, the coach stopped the play
often to point out certain weak
nesses in individual execution of
fundamentals.
Two offensive teams included Bud
Hawkins and Reggie Meade at for
wards, Jimmy Mears at center, and
Vard Loom is and Captain Mike
Reynolds at guard; Payne Palmer
and Frank Clough at forward, Les
McElwain at center, and Hal Edelen
and Rudy Rintala at guard.
Guard Combinations
Later Bunn had Clough and Mead
working together at forward, and
Palmer and Hawkins running in the
other forward combination.
While he shifted the guard com
binations from one team to another,
they remained the same, with
Loomis and Reynolds forming one,
and Edelen and Rintala the other.
Clough may need some introduc
tion to the less rabid of Farm bas
ketball fans, though he played on
the freshman squad of 1929. His
high school basketball was played
in Kansas City, and he seems to be
quite familiar with the mid-western
style of play.
Sudden Change
Rintala seems to be changing from
football to basketball form in a sur
prisingly rapid manner. Considering
that Monday was his first day of
practice, he is handling himself with
considerable ease on the court.
He was sinking a large percentage
of his long shots, a practice which
Bunn welcomes especially, since his
system calls for a guard which is
always a threat on long throws, so
that the opposing defense will be
drawn out to allow his offense to
function effectivelv.
