### Feg Murray, '16 
Ten years ago Joe Lynch knocked j
out Jack Sharkey in the fifteenth
round of their fight in New York, i
thus winning the right to face ban
tam weight champion Pete Herman
later (December 22, 1920). Lynch
was one of the few champions to

him in 1921. He in turn was beaten
by Buff, who was knocked out by

Accounts and record books differ as i
to just when he was recognized as

England, following Paddock, Savers,
Heenan, and King, and preceding
Allen, Goss, and Ryan. But "Ring
Battles of Centuries" states that he
beat Sam Hurst in eight rounds in i
1861, whereas "All Sports Record
Book" says: "1865, Jem Mace and |

j Sam Hurst, claimants for the va
i cated throne (after the Sayers
-1 Hcenan mill), fought. Mace won and
i became the acknowledged cham
i pion."
At any rate, Mace and Tom King
fought two battles in 1862, Jem win
ning the first in forty-three rounds
; and losing the second in twenty-one
rounds. In 1864 King retired and
Mace claimed the title. Ho toured
the U.S.A. in 1868. He beat Tom

, aged .348 or better from 1807 to
1910.
Forty years ago the first Army-
Navy football game was played, the

Book" says: "1865, Jem Mace and |

j Sam Hurst, claimants for the va
