# INTERCLASS CASABA COMPETITION OPENS WITH FAST TUSSLES
## 
### 
Interclass basketball opens tonight
■ i'i Encina Gym when the juniors
take the floor in an attempt to stop
the attack of a highly rated senior
quintet. This clash is scheduled for
7 o'clock and will be followed at 8
o'clock by the freshman-sophomore
tussle.
From early appearances the play
will probably develop into a battle
between the first- and fourth-year
men for first-place honors, with the
odds favoring the babes because
they will be able to use the com
• plete freshman cage squad and have
the advantage of regular practice.
Director of Basketball John Bunn
yesterday stated that no one will be

permitted to play without the ap
proval of the medical department.
