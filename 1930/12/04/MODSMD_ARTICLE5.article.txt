# NOTED SOPRANO SINGS TONIGHT
## Rethberg To Make First Campus Appearance 
### 
Elisabeth Rethberg, star soprano
of the Metropolitan Opera Company,
who will sing in the Pavilion here
at 8:20 o'clock tonight, bears the
triple crown of musician, poet, and
actress. She was the prima donna
last season of five opera companies,
in the United States and abroad, and
was heard by San Francisco audi
ences in the 1928 and 1929 seasons.
This is her first appearance on the
Stanford campus.
Her concert in Dreamland Audi
i torium on Monday night was en
thusiastically praised by San Fran
cisco critics. Alexander Fried, music
critic for the Chronicle, declares her
"peerless of any living soprano as
well as of the illustrious who are
dead."
Expressive Voice
He adds: "For her, vocal difficul
ties seem hardly to exist. In every
part of its scale the tone of her
naturally lovely voice is expressive
and immaculately clear. Flexible,
true, and easy, her singing ranged
from tenderest quiet to vivid drama
without strain."
Madame Rethberg was born in a
German village bordering on Sax
ony, and was sent to Dresden at the
age of sixteen to study voice and
the piano. She was engaged first by
the Dresden Royal Opera Company
after a private musicale in which
Fritz Reiner, famous conductor,
heard her sing. After her successes
in Germany, Austria, Norway, and
Sweden, she came to America where
she has since been prima donna of
the Metropolitan.
