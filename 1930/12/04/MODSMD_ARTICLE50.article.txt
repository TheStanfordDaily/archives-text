One more.set of hopes for the in
j tramural touch football champion
ship is due to be blasted when
Alpha Kappa Lambda's team clashes
with that of Delta Tau Delta at 3
o'clock on the Grays' gridiron.
Sigma Chi, the other team remain
ing in the race for the intramural
! title, drew a bye and is to meet the
' winner of today's contest in the
I finals next week.
Impressive Records
Both the Delts and the A.K.L.'s
i have displayed fine football in com
! piling their impressive records. Dur
; ing Alpha Kappa Lambda's march
t to the championship of League V,
they won six straight games from
I El Cuadro, Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta
! Kappa Epsilon, El Capitan, Phi Delta
I Theta, and Phi Sigma Kappa,
j Only the last-mentioned team ex
j tended the A.K.L.'s to their limit,
i The game had to be settled by the
j five extra plays route,
i Marplc a Star
t A tight defense and a powerful
j running attack, featuring Charles
I Marple, have been the factors in
! this continued success. The reasons
I why their attack has been so ef-
I fective are good teamwork and fine
i ball carrying.
i Marple does this latter task in
\ sensational fashion by utilizing to
j the utmost the fine interference of
. his teammates and his own shifti
i ness and speed. He has scored and
starred in every game his team has
I played. With the. possible exception
1 cf Deuel of the Sigma Nil's he is
i the cleverest running back in the
tournament.
I)clt Running Attack
Delta Tau Delta's powerful run
ning attack has brought her through
' the five games necessary to win
League ll's championship and last
Tuesday's contest with Theta Chi,
undefeated. Speed and deception are
provided by the backfielcl of track
! stars and a variety of plays.
Sweeps around end, sometimes
i started by lateral passes, have been
their most effective scoring plays.
! Werder, Twelve trees, and Nichols
do the ball carrying, Benninger and
Pierose do some excellent interfer
ing.
When these teams meet today two
powerful running attacks and two
j tight defenses will be clashing. The
result should be an interesting, close
1 game.

I)clt Running Attack
Delta Tau Delta's powerful run
ning attack has brought her through
' the five games necessary to win
League ll's championship and last
Tuesday's contest with Theta Chi,
undefeated. Speed and deception are
provided by the backfielcl of track
! stars and a variety of plays.
Sweeps around end, sometimes
i started by lateral passes, have been
their most effective scoring plays.
! Werder, Twelve trees, and Nichols
do the ball carrying, Benninger and
Pierose do some excellent interfer
ing.
When these teams meet today two
powerful running attacks and two
j tight defenses will be clashing. The
result should be an interesting, close
1 game.
One more.set of hopes for the in
j tramural touch football champion
ship is due to be blasted when
Alpha Kappa Lambda's team clashes
with that of Delta Tau Delta at 3
o'clock on the Grays' gridiron.
Sigma Chi, the other team remain
