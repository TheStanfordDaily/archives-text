### 
Though showing u marked im
provement over earlier perform
ances, the W.A.A. freshman basket
ball sextette went down to defeat
at the hands of the senior hoopsters
yesterday afternoon 18-12 in a hard
fought tussle. Half-time score was
10-5.
Freda Buckingham, starring for
the seniors, piled up 16 points for
them, sinking a sizable proportion of
her attempts at baskets. High-point
place for the freshmen was held by
Gwen Hitt.
Excellent team play characterized
both teams, particularly at center,
where the rival captains contended.
Sue Betty Dunlap did some nice
work at jump as well as at guard
in which position she later sub
stituted.
In a second-string game also
played yesterday the freshmen tied
the sophomores 15-15. Today the
first-string juniors meet the first
team sophomores in what is expect
ed to be one of the best battles of
the year.
