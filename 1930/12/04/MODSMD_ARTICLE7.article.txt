# NATION TO FACE BUDGET DEFICIT
## President States Economy Must Be Observed 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. (/P) â€”A
dcficit lies ahead and tax rates must
be increased, but still, President
Hoover today told Congress, the
government's finances are in a thor
oughly sound condition.
The dcficit he estimated at $180,-
000,000 and he said, in his annual
message transmitting the budget,
that the one per cent income tax
reduction granted a year ago could
not be continued.
But he submitted a balanced bud
get for the fiscal year 1932 and a
statement that rigid economy in
legislation would give the nation a
sound condition.
Although asserting appropriations
to relieve unemployment and help
farmers of the drought area would
tend to increase the deficit as es
timated, he expressed the opinion
these needs could be met without
undue danger.
The President was emphatic in
warning Congress against extrava
gant appropriations. Strict economy
must be observed, he said, if the
narrow surplus estimated for next
year is to be realized and a deficit
for that period avoided.
Total receipts for 1932, exclusive
of postal revenues, were estimated
at $4,083,119,000 and total expendi
tures at $4,054,519,000. Receipts for
the current year were set at $3,834,-
865,000 and expenditures at $4,014,-
941,000.
