"The responsibility for this acci

'When the question of additional
protection at this crossing was first
broached nparly two years ago we
'ifl'ered to make an installation con

[•quipped with two train indicators,
an installation which is particularly

laying the blame directly on the
railroad company.
Mrs. Christianson was led to at
tempt the crossing by a car driven
by an unidentified person which
crossed the tracks in front of her
and cleared them before the second
train which struck her reached the
intersection, according to a state
ment made to the police yesterday
by Professor Harris J. Ryan, who
witnessed the Uagedy.
