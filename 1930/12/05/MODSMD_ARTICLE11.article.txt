# Rethberg Scores Triumph Before Local Audience
## Metropolitan Opera Star Wins Favor In Varied Concert Group 
### Helen Thomas 
Elisabeth Rethberg is undoubtedly
the "world's perfect singer." Her
concert, given before an enthusiastic
audience in the Pavilion last night,
would alone be proof of her right to
that title. Her voice seems almost
supernatural, for it transcends the
limits of range and harmony. Her
highest tones are as pure and round
as those of the middle register and
her lower notes are full and rich.
Her program last night was di
vided amung operatic selections,
English ballads, and German Lieder.
Few sopranos would have the cour
age to begin a concert program with
opera, yet she sang Weber's "Leise,
Leise" from "Der Freischultz" with
ease and power.
English Songs
'"Love's Philosophy," was the most
generously applauded of the charm
ing English songs, but the audience
felt the soprano more at home in the
field of the German Lied. Schu
mann. Brahms, and Strauss are mas
ters deatÂ« to every German heart,
and Madame Rethberg sang them so
beautifully their meaning was clear
in spite of the foreign words.' Her
personality, while singing this
group, was particularly attractive.
Among her operatic selections, the
famous. "Jewel Song" was most en
thusiastically received. It is an old
favorite of concert artists, yet few
have sung it with the womanliness
of Rethberg. Goethe's heroine is
after all, not an arch coquette.
Madame Rethberg was particularly
generous with her encores. Among
them were Schubert's lovely "Die
Forelle" and Schumann's "Der Nus
sbaum,' which closed an evening
memorable in the musical history of
the University.
