## 
### BEATRICE BISHOP 
The Stanford Symphony Orches
tra, which was first made known to
the campus last spring quarter by
its beautiful presentation of Schu
bert's "Unfinished Symphony," will
again entertain music-lovers, next
Wednesday night with a program of
classical music featuring Beetho
ven's "First Symphony," as well as
Bach's "Double Concerto," for two
violins.
It was more than a year ago that
a group of students, interested in
music, banded together and organ
ized the orchestra from students, lo
cal talent, and musicians from vari
ous cities on the peninsula.
First Group Small
Starting with a small number, un
der the organization of Elwyn
Bugge, Bourne Eaton, and Daniel
Bryant, the orchestra has grown to
more than 50 members.
Daniel Bryant, a senior, registered
from Eagle Rock, and a former vio

i linist in the Oregon State Symphony
Orchestra, was selected as director
i by the group. Bryant has had much
previous experience in the musical
field. He is also a member of the
two-man debate team which will
meet Hawaii late in December at
the Islands.
Activity Voluntary
The orchestra is a purely volun
tary organization. Through the ef
forts of the group it has been recog
i nized by the administration as a
regular student, activity. Any per
| son interested in music is eligible to
membership. With the aid of a gift
of $1500, presented by different ad
mirers, an almost complete set of
symphony instruments has been
purchased.
The concert, which will be held in
the Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock, is
, presented under the auspices of the
Committee on Public Exercises. The
public is invited.
