tion pictures of molecules in action
| are being taken, Professor George
i L. Clark, of the University of 111 i
| nois, disclosed here today.
This amazing stride in science, of
-1 fcring untold possibilities for dis
! coveries, was revealed at the Radio
logical Society of North America.
Students working with Professor
Clark, world famous for his ad
vancement in X-ray tube design,
are now doing this work in the
! university laboratory at Urbana,
j Illinois.
The motion pictures are made
possible by the new tube, operated
j at 50,000 volts and 20 to 100 millim
percs and which has cut the time r»f
J X-ray pictures from two hours to
: one-fiftieth of a second. It is used as
{a super-microscope presenting dif-
I fraction ray revealing mo 1 ular
; structure rather than the direct
I plane photography.
