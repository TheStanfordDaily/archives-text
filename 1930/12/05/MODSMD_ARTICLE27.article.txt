stitute the main work at present.

To Includc Lounge
Plans for the gymnasium include
a lounge going off the porch around
the patio which is picturesquely
surrounded by heavy pillars in ac
cordance with the rest of the Quad
architecture.
The front of the building is com
posed almost entirely of offices and
medical rooms which run off a long
corridor. A classroom is included in
the arrangement of the offices.
One of the few changes in the
plans was the decision to have a
ceiling on the dancing studio in
stead of the exposed beams which
have been left in the main gym.
Outside the building, the hockey
fields have come up and will be
ready for play winter quarter. Now
tennis courts are not included in the
plans.
