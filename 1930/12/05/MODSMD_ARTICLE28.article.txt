# FIRE CAUSES GREAT STANDARD OIL LOSS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. <t. (/P)â€”Streams
of flaming oil pouring from the
Pratt works of the Standard Oil
Company illuminated the Brooklyn
waterfront today.
The fire, which threatened for a
time to wipe out the entire plant,
was stemmed by forces working by
land and by water after a fight of
three hours.
More than 200,000 gallons of gaso
line, crude oil, arid turpentine and
IS tanks in which it was stored,
were destroyed. Piers, barges, a fire
boat, and a tanker were damaged
as the fiery mass poured into the
East River between the Williams
burg and Twenty-ninth Street
bridges.
