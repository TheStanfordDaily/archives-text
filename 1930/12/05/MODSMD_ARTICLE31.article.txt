# WOMEN SPEED $17,000 PLANS
## Co-eds lo "Beg, Borrow, Or Steal" For Quota 
### 
j Spurred by the knowledge that
I contractors are keeping up to a
! schedule which will finish the new
: gym early in January, the women
| are making extensive plans to "beg,
: borrow, or steal" the $17,000 neces-
I sary for equipment, according to
Gertrude Laidlaw, in charge bf the
I finance campaign.
Tonight the Carnival, which is so
| far the most extensive of the plans
j to raise money, is expected to raise
j approximately $1,000. The money
j which has been realized lo date is
j largely from donations, selling food,
, and tinfoil, saving bookstore receipts,
I and social affairs.
"We are hoping that other friends
! who have known of or aided in the
! 30-year struggle to obtain a new
j gymnasium, will help the women
' furnish the building and add to the
j contributions which have already
i been received," said Louise Artz,
â–  president of W.A.A.
I Next week an extensive campaign
! to sell A.S.S.U. concert series season
! tickets will be carried on. The
I women are to receive a 10 per cent
; commission on the first 150 tickets
| sold with a $25 bonus, and a further
! 15 per cent commission for any sold
| over this quota.
