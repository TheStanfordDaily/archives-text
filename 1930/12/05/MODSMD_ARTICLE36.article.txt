# SOME HELPFUL HINTS

### 
To prevent free speech at the I'niversity' of California the
Kxecutive Committee there has appointed a sub-committee to devise
ways whereby campus publications can be told to shut up.
Why doesn't the California committee simply place a censorship
on all publications and stop worrying about the possibility of waking
up some morning and finding itself oil the front pages of the citv
newspapers
Since the start of the American nation there has been the right
of free >pcech and free press. It has become a tradition in American
lite.
The only obstacle in the path of free expression is that of good
taste or judgment or expediency. It's the'duty of those expressing
free speech to observe good taste, judgment, expediency, or what
ever tits the situation.
California's Kxecntive Committee may well recognize judgment,
expediency, and good taste —to make sure these are observed by
student editors at the Berkeley institution hereafter, the zealous
student government only has to set itself up as a judge of what
shall appear in student publications.
It's all very convenient—there's no trouble connected with cen
sorship; the committee can daily read every line of copy, squelch
mention of its friends' names when they are referred to unfavor
ably. It's a very simple process.
I ndoubtedly the morale and sense of independence and honesty
and dependability will improve a hundred fold at California.
Certainly, a censorship is the very thing to clamp on student
publications if the I'niversity of California wants to prosper.
If the censorship is too lenient—as it is certain to be—why
doesn't the California committee simply suspend all campus publi
cations and let it go at that. ,
