# TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

### 
Stanford's l ive Hundred have often cavorted on Ihe greens
ward, playing hockey. They have sometimes tripped the light fan
last ir at eampns dances. \iul even have thev been known once a
year to garb themselves in a most peculiar fashion and frolic at (he
Women's Conference I'artv.
hut never before have they essayed the roles of barkers, side
show oddities, and concession operators at an AIM niversity carni
val. Last summer there was a private one at Koble, but the carnival
ttiis evening w ill be public that everybody may attend.
Tonight's the night, and the Pavilion's the place. There'll be
dancing and bowling and mystery maze threading and such novel
entertainment as nail pounding and crockery breaking. As a special
attraction, there's to be a sideshow, telling the things that need to be
told about the I'ive Hundred.
It's all for that new women's gymnasium so soon to be com
puted. ()f the $20,000 needed to buy lockers and equipment for
ihe new gym, $H>.s()o has yet to be raised. The. women want money,
and they should get it as Stanford goes carnival-minded tonight.
In any case, the frolic under the Pavilion "big top" should be a
good one. Live hundred women guarantee it.
