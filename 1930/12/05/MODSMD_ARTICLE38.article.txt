# PETTY SQUABBLING TAKES ITS TOLL
## 
### 
!i the Southern Pacific Company and Mayor ( hristensen of
Palo Alto will cease shouting "liar" at each other, and co-operate
t<> install safety gates at I'alo Alto grade crossings, repetitions of
Wednesday's horrible accident will not reoccur.
As is customary after each of these tragedies, city and railroad
officials have descended to the aimless pastime of laving the blame
on the other tellows shoulders. Alanv letters are written, galleys
ot newspaper type are idled, hut no safety gates arc constructed.
Apparently both the I'alo Alto and Southern Pacific authorities
value technicalities over human lives. The job of installing safety
gates a simple one. and could have been completed in a fewdav's
time if either man had seriously undertaken the work.
\ow that the need once again has been so tragically demon
strated, it is hoped that one of these parties can forget the pettv
squabble long enough to see that gates are installed immediatelv.
Prompt action is the finest wa\ that we can now honor the grade
crossing victims.
Stanford will have the privilege of hearing an outstanding mem
ber of the Mritish foreign service, when Consul-( ieneral < lerald
i ampbell speaks to an all-l'niversity assembly at 11 o'clock this
morning. A discussion of the problems of dominion status can be
expected.
