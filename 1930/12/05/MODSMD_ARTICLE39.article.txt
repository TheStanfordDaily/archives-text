NO BED OF ROSES. By <). W. The
Macaulay Company, New York.
1930. Price $2,00.
This "revelation of a soul" com
piled by Marjorie E. Smith, a writer
of growing consequence, from the
diaries.of O. W., allegedly a notori
ous prostitute and dope fiend, is
worth reading.
The diaries themselves are uncon
! vincing. Daily entrees anticipate
(and not at all subtly) events which
eventually happen and are recorded.
1 Surely O. W. .was not clairvoyant.
It is only when Miss Smith, the
compiler, deserts direct quotation
from her alleged data that "No Bed
of Roses" achieves distinction.
I The diminishing returns of a pros
titute are recorded. But of greater
social consequence are O. W.'s ex
periences as a doper, and the almost
| impossibility of escaping the drug
; habit. Even the doctors are "junkies."

EARLY SORROW. By Thomas
Mann. Alfred A. Knopf &. Co.
New York. 1930. (At the Stan
ford Bookstore. 51.50.)
"Early Sorrow" is a very short
novel, it describes a single incident
in the life of a little girl; but it
presents a complete and very well
drawn picture of a German bour
geois family.
Mann creates complete characters
and he treats them sympathetically.
There is an economy of detail in
this work which does not sacrifice
anything of realistic effect, and
which should be studied by those
writers who attempt to produce
photography by a piling up of
meaningless small facts.
The book is, in fact, an example
of the best type of work which can
be accomplished by those authors
who draw psychological character
studies according to the rules of
Freud and his followers. —E. E. W.
