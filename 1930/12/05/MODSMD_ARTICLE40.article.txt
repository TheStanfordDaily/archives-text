Life continues to be just one
I darned thing after another. We've
' no more than started recuoerating
from the effects of the bright lights
of football season, and the bright
lights of Christmas are shining at
us already.
Palo Alto streets are acquiring
long festoons of red and green
■ lights, in honor of the holidays that
will mean the end of another quar
ter, another year, and of another
string of finishing finals.
Here's an idea: something to
j occupy the minds and time of
our campus artistic genii. Why
1 not appoint a committee to deco
) rate all the trees on Palm Drive
like Christmas trees, with lights
and hells and all the rest of it?
Maybe a little mistletoe, even.
Dates grow on palm trees, you
know ....
The Five Hundred, though, being
wise and super-educated, would
doubtless tell us that it wouldn't be

I in good taste, and that it wouldn't
pay. See what they did to our propo
sition of a Kissing Booth at the
Carnival. Only that wasn't intended
to be artistic —purely a money
making scheme. Stanford men are
nothing if not philanthropic.
The Carnival, at any rate, is
scheduled to come off with a bang,
tonight, if nothing else sounds par
ticularly attractive, the Daily as
sures us that '"tea, coffee, and choco
late cake will be served by Senior
| women in lounging pajamas."
"PEER BILL PREPARED BY
HOUSE WETS," says a headline
in the San Francisco Chronicle.
Expense account, we presume.
Associated Press dispatches dis
close that a disgruntled reporter
shot at and missed the Spanish pre
mier. That calls for drastit action—
Either complete muzzling of the
press, or compulsory target practice
for journalists.
