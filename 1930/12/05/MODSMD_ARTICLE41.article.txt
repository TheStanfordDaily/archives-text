The Editor, Sir:
With the display of posters an
nouncing the second appearance of
the Stanford Symphony Orchestra
December 10, I am reminded of the
thrill of thoroughgoing delight with
which members of the Stanford
! community listened to the first of
' fering of this splendid organization
last winter. I can think of nothing
| that has occurred in recent years
! which has occasioned so much fa
i vorable comment along all classes
j as this refreshingly spontaneous and
altogether able exhibition of organ-
I izing genius and sincere musician
j ship. In delighted amazement people
looked at each other and said. "Can
this be really true?"
I am informed that we may con
fidently expect even more of this
| year's more-experienced and con
| siderably augmented orchestra. Rich
treats for music lovers have been in
, preparation these many weeks since
the opening of the quarter and those
j who would enjoy them would do

well 1o come early to the Assembly
Hall next Wednesday evening. Few
communities are privileged to ex
perience, free of charge, symphony
music rendered by able performers
; who at the same time have the
I spontanietv, fire, and enthusiasm of
youth, and who are playing for the
sheer love of what they are doing.
Sincerely, J. G. Emerson.
