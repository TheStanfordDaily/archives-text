## ROCKNE VS. JONES 
### 
In Los Angeles tomorrow, the 1930
football season will come to a climax
with the meeting of Knute Rockne's
Ramblers of Notre Dame and the
Terrible Trojans of Southern Cali
fornia. And we pick Knute and his
second edition of the Ibanc? quar
tet to stampede the Thundering
Herd.
Having thus gone on record re
garding the epic, we will now ex
plain. In the first place, we expect
the South Bend tackles to seriously
impede the progress of the far
famed Jones power plays. In the
second, we expect Carideo's punting
will keep the Cardinal and Gold in
a hole. Lastly, the Kocknemcn will
pass over the heads of the Head
man's hackflcld.
And so having sung a dirge for
Ihe Southland, we admit that the
score will be very close—so close,
in fact, that the spectators will get
their money's worth at the contest.
Which will be considerable money's
worth, according to some of the
prices for tickets we have heard
<\uoted.
With Mullins lost to the invaders,
Knute is seriously handicapped,
112 irst Savoldj, now Mullins, have
been withdrawn from the fullback
position, leaving that precious job
in inexperienced hands. But some
how we feel that Mullins will play
at least part of the game tomorrow.
One of the most potent factors
which the Sage of South Bend pos
sesses is the ability to play upon
the emotions of his men, to arouse
them to a peak of fighting spirit
which sweeps all before it. That is
something which Jones cannot
match, a point where the Trojans
will be tried and found wanting.
Added to a psychological edge, is
(he advantage in field generalship
which also goes to Notre Dame. In
Carideo the Trojans face the best
field marshal in football this season.
Trained in the Kocknc school, which
demands the best of leaders, Carideo
is an outstanding example of his
coach's ability to pick generals.
Psychologically, mentally—an edge
to Notre Dame. Physically—an edge
to the Trojans. Mind vs. Matter?
Perhaps, but the mental edge far
exceeds the physical, and on that
1 asis v/e see Notre Dame the win

Carideo the Trojans face the best
field marshal in football this season.
Trained in the Kocknc school, which
demands the best of leaders, Carideo
is an outstanding example of his
coach's ability to pick generals.
Psychologically, mentally—an edge
to Notre Dame. Physically—an edge
to the Trojans. Mind vs. Matter?
Perhaps, but the mental edge far
exceeds the physical, and on that
1 asis v/e see Notre Dame the win

In Los Angeles tomorrow, the 1930
football season will come to a climax
with the meeting of Knute Rockne's
Ramblers of Notre Dame and the
Terrible Trojans of Southern Cali
fornia. And we pick Knute and his
second edition of the Ibanc? quar
tet to stampede the Thundering
Herd.
Having thus gone on record re
garding the epic, we will now ex
plain. In the first place, we expect
the South Bend tackles to seriously
impede the progress of the far
famed Jones power plays. In the
second, we expect Carideo's punting
will keep the Cardinal and Gold in
a hole. Lastly, the Kocknemcn will
pass over the heads of the Head
man's hackflcld.
And so having sung a dirge for
Ihe Southland, we admit that the
score will be very close—so close,
in fact, that the spectators will get
their money's worth at the contest.
Which will be considerable money's
worth, according to some of the
prices for tickets we have heard
<\uoted.
With Mullins lost to the invaders,
Knute is seriously handicapped,
112 irst Savoldj, now Mullins, have
been withdrawn from the fullback
position, leaving that precious job
in inexperienced hands. But some
how we feel that Mullins will play
at least part of the game tomorrow.
One of the most potent factors
which the Sage of South Bend pos
sesses is the ability to play upon
the emotions of his men, to arouse
them to a peak of fighting spirit
which sweeps all before it. That is
something which Jones cannot
match, a point where the Trojans
will be tried and found wanting.
Added to a psychological edge, is
(he advantage in field generalship
which also goes to Notre Dame. In
Carideo the Trojans face the best
field marshal in football this season.
