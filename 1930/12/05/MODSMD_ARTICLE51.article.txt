### Michael Crofoot 
Crushing Alpha Kappa Lambda's
! touch football team, 18-0, with su
i perior power and speed, Delta Tau
j Delta won their way to the finals
! of the intramural tournament on the
! Grays' field yesterday afternoon.
Marple, the spearhead of the
; A.K.L. attack, was effectually stop
: ped for the first time this season,
| by the speed of the Delts' backfield,
[ which is studded with Stanford
I track stars. This same speed made
! their sweeps around end behind
j soul-jarring interference a constant
I scoring threat.
A.K.L.'s Tire
Tired out by their long hard
! schedule and handicapped by the
i injury of their passer, McCoy, early
in the game, the A.K.L.'s staged a
I courageous battle, but were out
' classed.
Receiving the kick-off, they drove
t the ball down to the Delt 20-yard
line, where their attempted drop
kick was short. Putting the ball in
| play on the 20-yard stripe, the Delts
sent Twelvetrees around right end
| for 80 yards and a touchdown. Stub
born resistance cheeked the Delts
! for the rest of the period, but in the
I second half they scored two more
j touchdowns.
Twelvetrees Scores
Successive long runs by Werder,
Twelvetrees, and Nichols, brought
the pigskin into scoring position for
the second touchdown, Twelvetrees
carrying it over. The last score was
the result of a pass, from Eddy tp
Werder, which traveled 40 yards in
the air.
The victors are to meet Sigma Chi
for the intramural championship
next week.
