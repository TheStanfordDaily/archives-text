# Owens And Masters Leave Farm Tonight For P.C.C. Conclave
## Arrangement of Grid Schedule Is Main Object of Meet; Discussion of Professionalism in Athletics At Confab Is Thought Unlikely 
### 
I>ROFESSOR WILLIAM OWENS of the Law School and Alfred Masters,
General Manager of the Board of Athletic Control, will leave the
campus tonight for Los Angeles to represent Stanford in the annual
meeting of the Pacific Coast Conference, of which Professor Owens is
president. Arrangement of the Coast Conference football schedule is the
main object of the meeting, while the advance program includes also

> discussion of minor rule changes
and consideration of the proposed
control of gridiron scouting.
Final Approval
Masters will represent Stanford in
drawing up the schedule, while
Owens will attend in the capacity
of president, as well as of Cardinal
representative on the faculty com
mittee which puts the final approval
on the schedule submitted by the
managers.
A successor for Professor Owens
as president of the conferencc will
be elected, and a new treasurer will
be chosen.
Both Owens and Masters have ex
pressed doubt that the recent flurry
involving California and U.S.C. in
charges and counter charges of pro
fessionalism in athletics will be con
sidered.
Poor Schedule
Masters declared that the schedule
will be poor from the standpoint of
home games for Stanford. The
Washington, U.S.C., and Dartmouth
tussles will be on distant gridirons,
while Minnesota and California will
meet the Cardinal eleven here.
Regardless of whether such an
arrangement would be advantageous
or not, Owens explained that the
U.S.C. game cannot be permanently
fixed later than it is at present in
the Stanford schedule. However, in
1931 it will be two weeks later than
this year due to an alternating
agreement with University of Cali
fornia giving each school the No
| vember date every other season.
