position of the season, junior women
hoopsters yesterday afternoon over
came the sophomore sextette 26-19
[ in the crack game of the year. Both
teams played the best brand of bas
ketball seen on the W.A.A. courts
in the past three years.
The juniors pulled up from their
previous rating beyond all expecta
tion through the excellent work of
Marian Terwilliger and Jane Snyder i
at guard. This duo played a beauti- t
ful passing game to forward terri- j
. tory where Hal lien Hickman, cap- \
tain, made good 18 points. Margery
Thomas at center with her superior J
height consistently outjumped her
| opponent.

• point scorer for the sophomores and !
gave her guards something to worry j
about. Clare Nichols, sophomore j
captain, fought hard at center in 1
: spite of her recent illness. Lineups '
