## Ramblers Without Mullins Not So Formidable To Trojans 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oec. 4. MP)—With
Dutch Wilcox, first-string end, cer
j tain to see service against the South
| Bend squad directed by Knute
Rockne, Southern California's hopes
for a victory over Notre Dame took
| a rise today.
| Coincident with the Trojan end's
: return to the lineup came the an
| r.ouncement from the rolling camp
i of the invaders that "Moon" Mullins,
i regular fullback, would be lost to
I Notre Dame for the tilt.
Trek To South
Throngs have already begun their
trek to the metropolis of the South
in preparation for the clash of the
giants in the Coliseum here, and a
colorful crowd will await the kick
off, for seats in the stadium have
; been resold at premiums for several
I weeks.
| What: the tilt will unfold before
the mob of thousands who will jam
■ the seats Saturday remains to be
1 seen. Certain it is that the master
! from Indiana and his chosen field
general, Frank Caridco. will lose no
time in striking at the avowed
! weakness of the Cardinal and Gold
cohorts—forward pass defense.
Fa jit Attack
Countering with a brilliant run
ning attack featuring the Jones
power plays, lateral passes, and spin
-1 ners, the Trojans will seek to bring
the five-year record of the two
' teams to a three-to-two basis in
favor of the Notre Dame group, for
another loss would put Jones far
behind Rockne in coaching con-
J quests.
