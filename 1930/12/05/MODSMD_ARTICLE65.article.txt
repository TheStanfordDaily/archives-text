# STANFORD LIBRARY ATTRACTS BIGGER CROWDS THAN U.C.
## 
### 
Stanford students are just twice
ns studious as those attending Cali-.
iornia if statistics showing the num
ber of books taken from the loan
desks of the respective libraries are
to be believed. The number of books
used daily during final week de
crases just half as much here as at
U.C. as compared with the number
used on an average day. According
to an article in the Daily Califor
nian, the daily use of books falls
from 500 to 150 while figures in the
files of the Stanford loan desk show
a decrease of from over 1000 per day
to less than 500.
Tuesday, December 2, proved a
record day for the business at Phi
Bete Lodge. A total of 1792 books
were taken from the desk. Wednes
day promised to beat even this rec
ord but for the slight mishap in the
evening when industrious spirits
were more or less dampened by the
lack of litfht. Figures show an in
crease of 25 or more books in both
the morning and afternoon, but a
decided fall of more than 175 in the
evening.
