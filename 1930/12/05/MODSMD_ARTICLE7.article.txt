# BRITAIN'S MINERS HALT COAL STRIKE THROUGH BALLOTS
## 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 4. (/Pjâ€”There will
be no great national coal strike in
Great 1 Britain for the time being at
any rate.
Delegates to the miners' confer
ence here today turned down a
strike proposal by the narrow mar
gin of 230,000 to 209,000. Their deci
sion also implied there would be no
strike ballot in the mining districts
in question.
Interest now has turned to the in
dividual districts, above all to Scot
land, where 85,000 miners arc still
out and to South Wales where the
outcome of the negotiations going on
between the owners and miners may
wfcll give a lead to the whole coun
try.
The "spread-over" working ar
rangement, which entails a 90-hour
working fortnight against a 7Vfe
hour day guarantee now holds the
center of the stage as a focal point
in almost all the negotiations, and
it is in the industrial districts the
spread-over now will be discussed.
