Take away the 87% of energy now ex
tracted from coal, oil, and gas . . . and we
would be back in the year 1855 ... the year
Crane Co. was founded. Take valves and
fittings away, and we would be deprived
not of 87 but of 9 1 Co. For from water
power as well as from coal, gas, and oil,
energy is almost never extracted in the
modern world but valves and fittings enter
into the process.
It is significant that the history of Crane
Co. and the history of modern utilisation
of natural energy, cover almost exactly
the same period. Many years ago, Crane
metallurgists and engineers began the de
velopment of piping materials for each

Take away the 87% of energy now ex
tracted from coal, oil, and gas . . . and we
would be back in the year 1855 ... the year
Crane Co. was founded. Take valves and
fittings away, and we would be deprived
not of 87 but of 9 1 Co. For from water
power as well as from coal, gas, and oil,
energy is almost never extracted in the
modern world but valves and fittings enter
into the process.
It is significant that the history of Crane
Co. and the history of modern utilisation
of natural energy, cover almost exactly
the same period. Many years ago, Crane
metallurgists and engineers began the de
velopment of piping materials for each
new need as it appeared. The years since
have seen every Crane resource . . . re
search, engineering, production . ... de
voted to supplying materials that would
keep the road to progress open.
What Crane has learned and the materials
that it has developed will be of vital in
terest to you after you leave school.
Let us send you the story of research
in piping metals, " Pioneering in Science."
