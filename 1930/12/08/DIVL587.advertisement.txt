Science Aids in
Photographing
Correct Facial
Expressions
Photography's hard e s (
problem is to secure a
really pleasing, vivid and
natural likeness. A great
percentage of portraits in
variably register a more or
less unnatural expression
brought about by self-con
sciousness, forced posing,
and an unavoidable eve
strain caused by excessive
ly bright light. To practi
cally eliminate this prob*
t lem in nearly every in
stance. the Allen Studio
has pioneered the entire
field by originating and in
stalling a number of ultra
nTodern and scientific fea
tures intended to entertain,
attract, and interest the
sitter in such a manner that
all the above faults are re
duced to a minimum.
No Bright Lights Used
By using the latest scien
tific lighting invention, the
semi-invisible Photo Elec
tric Beam, an electric ray
so highly actinic that ex
posures are made in a split
fraction of a second with
no more glare than strik
ing a match, negatives are
made without the extreme
harshness so prevalent in
arc lamp and flash lighting.
The negative is made at the
precise instant the photo
grapher notes the pleasing
ly proper facial expression
so much desired in a por
trait.
A Motion Picture
Theatre
We entertain the sitter
throughout the period of
posing with attractive mov
ing pictures, showing comic
and other topical reels.
An Individual
Radio Station
A personal broadcast is
given over our inter-studio
Kadio Station, FOTO, an
nouncing stories to the kid
dies and jokes and talks
to the grown-ups.
A Cordial Invitation
We invited all Stanford
students and members of
the faculty to visit our
studio (without any OJ»-
IKIA TIO X Wll ATE VER).
and see this wonderfully
marvelous innovation in
portrait photography. You
will quickly understand
how it is possible to make
portraits look pleasing, life
like, and snappy.
