### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. (/-P)—A little
man from Denver, the former Judge
Ben B. Lindsey, turned Golden Rule
Sunday into a pandemonium of epi
thets, recrimination, and violence
today at Bishop William T. Man
ning's church—the fashionable
cathedral of St. John the Divine.
Lindsey, with one friend at his
side, sat tense among the 3500 well
groomed worshippers and heard
himself scored as the author of a
book "the most filthy, insidious, and
cleverly written pieces of propa
ganda ever published in behalf of
lewdness, promiscuity, adultery, and
jnrestrained sexular gratification."
Bishop Denounces
The Bishop, coldly calm, brought
his sermon to an end with a denun
ciation of "a man who stands openly
for legalized free love under cover
>112 the term 'companionate mar
riage.' "
He turned his back to the con
gregation and bowed his head in
prayer.
The Denver champion of compan
onatc marriage strode forward and
leaped upon a table just below the
oulpit in which the Bishop still en
oned the ascription.

justice I ask for five minutes to
inswer your unfair attack."
The prayer of the Bishop of the
Diocese of New York was drowned

Hourt Judge of Denver. The Bishop

NEW YORK, Dec. 7. (/-P)—A little
man from Denver, the former Judge
Ben B. Lindsey, turned Golden Rule
Sunday into a pandemonium of epi
thets, recrimination, and violence
today at Bishop William T. Man
ning's church—the fashionable
cathedral of St. John the Divine.
Lindsey, with one friend at his
side, sat tense among the 3500 well
groomed worshippers and heard
himself scored as the author of a
book "the most filthy, insidious, and
cleverly written pieces of propa
ganda ever published in behalf of
lewdness, promiscuity, adultery, and
jnrestrained sexular gratification."
Bishop Denounces
The Bishop, coldly calm, brought
his sermon to an end with a denun
ciation of "a man who stands openly
for legalized free love under cover
>112 the term 'companionate mar
riage.' "
He turned his back to the con
gregation and bowed his head in
prayer.
The Denver champion of compan
onatc marriage strode forward and
leaped upon a table just below the
oulpit in which the Bishop still en
oned the ascription.

"Bishop Manning," he cried, his
/oice electrifying the thousands who
had been listening to the Bishop's
excoriation, "you have falsely repre
sented me! If this is not a house of
justice it is not a house of God! In
justice I ask for five minutes to
inswer your unfair attack."
The prayer of the Bishop of the
Diocese of New York was drowned
>y the voice of the former Children's
Hourt Judge of Denver. The Bishop
■emained with his back to the pews.

Two ushers sprang forward, puli

athedral. one of the most famous

A hundred or more men and wo

nto the aisles, and rushed forward.
A man's voice cried: "Punch him."

Profanity was heard. The aisle
