# Subsidization Fight May Be Probed By P.C.C. At Meeting
## Football, Baseball Schedules Will Be Considered In Three-Day Conclave of Member Delegates; Faculty Men May Be Storm Center 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7 (P.1.P.). â€”With settlement of football and base
ball schedules for 1931 as the main order of business, managers and coaches
; of the ten Pacific Coast Conference universities will meet here in a three
day conclave beginning tomorrow.
At the same time, faculty delegates will consider proposed changes in
rules and may tackle the eligibility and subsidization controversy that has
been raging unofficially since November 10. Stanford will be represented

by Professor W. B. Owens and Grad
| uate Manager Alfred R. Masters.
Faculty Meeting
It is expected that the faculty
' meeting will develop into the storm
center of the convention, although it
has been officially intimated that the
differences between California and
Southern California through the stu
dent press will not come up for dis
cussion. The row so far has been
fanned largely by undergraduate
editors and no recognition of it may
take place in the meeting.
However, Dean Thomas M. Put
nam of California has launched an
inquiry into ihe eligibility of ath
letes at Berkeley and may suggest
that the same process be extended
to other Conference institutions by
a vote of the convention.
U.C.L.A.-U.S.C. Game
While the faculty is conferring,
managers and coaches may hit a
stumbling block in the differences
between Southern California and
U.C.L.A. over the matter of a foot
ball date for 1931. The Bruins have
insisted on a game in mid-season,
while the Trojans, up to the present
lime, have not seen their way clear
to offer anything but the opening
date.
If rteither institution will change
its position it is probable that the
two schools will not meet during the
1931 season.
