# EDITOR PREDICTS HARD STRUGGLE FOR HOOVER IN RE-ELECTION FIGHT
## 
### John S. Tolman 
"Hoover will have a tremendous
! battle on his hands for re-election
in 1932, with Franklin D. Roosevelt
â–  probably opposing him as the Demo
! cratic candidate," predicted Henry F.
Pringle, a former editor of the Out
look, in an interview yesterday.
"I do not believe that Hoover will |
I have much trouble getting the Re- j
publican nomination, although when
1 I left Washington three weeks ago j
there were party forces at work :
against him," continued Pringle. "To I
predict Ihe final results of the next j
presidential campaign so far in ad- j
vance is risky as there are sure to |
be new developments. The country, j
however, is predominantly Republi- j
can and Hoover should win, if he |
runs. On the other hand the mem- ,
bers of the Democratic National !
Committee arc now extremely opti- j
mistic; they already see themselves ,
in office.
Has Had Bad Luck
"Hoover has had more bad luck
than any other President. He has i
been especially unfortunate in two
particulars: first, the business dc- |
pression over which he had no con- j
trol, and the rising tide of i
wet sentiment which is undoubtedly J
sweeping the country and which .
finds Hoover a political dry. The |
eighteenth amendment will be one j
of the most important issues in the [

I next campaign.
"That Hoover has been tremen
dously conscientious and wholly in
ept, is my personal opinion," Pringle
| said. "He is now as partisan as
I Coolidge was. He has not kept faith
; with the country in many instances,
| and he has shown all the woak
j nesses of a business executive in a
! political'office.
Hoover Partisan
"Hoover proved himself to be a
: partisan Republican when heal-
I lowed Republican leaders in Con
| gress to kill a bill proposed by Dem
j ocrats which was destined to reveal
I the true number of unemployed in
j the United States. It was feared that
j accurate unemployed figures might
seriously injure the chances of Re-i
i publican candidates in November's
olection. i
Pringle, an experienced political
observer and author, has just fin
ished a study of the President, the
results of which will appear in a
series of articles in the New Yorker.
Pringle is the author of "Alfred E.
Smith; A Critical Study" and "Big
Frogs," a>id is a frequent contributor
to Harper's, American Mercury,
Worlds Work, and other periodicals,
fie recently resigned the editorship
of Outlook and is now residing in j
Atherton, where he is engaged in ,
writing a biography of Theodore j
Roosevelt.
