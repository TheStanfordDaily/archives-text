# DE LANUX, FRENCH OBSERVER, TO TELL OF LEAGUE AFFAIRS
## 
### 
Pierre de Lanux, who will deliver
a lecture Wednesday evening at 7
o'clock in the Little Theater on "The
Outlook for Disarmament," is the di
rector of the Paris information office
of the League of Nations. In con
nection with his work under the
League of Nations, De Lanux must
necessarily keep himself well in
formed on international affairs, and
is especially well qualified to speak
on the subject of disarmament.
De Lanux is known as an editor
and writer, and organizer and exec
utive, a speaker, a linguist, and an
internationalist. His present position
calls for co-ordination between
French associations dealing with the
League and international affaix-s, and
supplying information to the public,
the press and scholars. He keeps in
constant touch with the Assembly,
the Council, and the Secretariat of
the League and with all of the com
missions.
This is his second tour of the Uni
ted States. In 1929, under the aus
pices of the League of Nations Asso
ciation, he completed a tour of 100
lectures in 100 days.
This lecture will not conflict with
the concert which the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra is presenting the
same evening, but will precede the
concert.
