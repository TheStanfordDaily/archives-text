"Unemployment is costing Great
Britain $1,000 a minute and depres

over the world," was the statement
used by the Honorable Gerald
Campbell, former British Consul
General in San Francisco, to char
acterize the British problem of un
employment before an all-Univer
sity assembly held Friday.
Campbell pointed out that an in
crease in the standard of living of
a.siatic peoples is necessary to ab
sorb the tremendous overproduction
existing in Great Britain and other
countries. A world-wide organiza
tion having the best of co-operation
and leadership is needed to accom
plish this end, he said.
Economic unity between the
mother country and the dominions
is necessary, he said, to achieve de
sirable conditions. "We want to
speed up production and consump
tion and stimulate immigration to
the Dominions to relieve the popu
lation pressure."
In conclusion Campbell stated that
it is up to the United States and
Great Britain to have the courage
and vision to keep peace in the
world.
