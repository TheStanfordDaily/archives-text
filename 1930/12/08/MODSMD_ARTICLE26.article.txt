# COTTRELL PREDICTS NO REAL UPHEAVAL IN FRENCH POLITICS
## 
### 
In regard to the present situation
1 in France, Professor Edwin Angell
Cottrell, head of the Political Sci
i ence Department, sees "no serious
J political upheaval in sight." As to
who will replace the fallen Tardieu
ministry, Professor Cottrell thinks
that "the president probably will
appoint a premier who will select a
cabinet of much the same complex
ion as the former."
The cause of Tardieu's resignation
i is clear, said Cottrell. "The financial
I difficulties which involve several
members of the cabinet were suffi
cient to convince the senate, a very
conservative body, and one which
seldom overturns a ministry, that
the cabinet had not played fair with
the finances, and should be subjected
to a votÂ« of confidence." While the
vote was close, it favored the resig
nation of the Tardieu ministry.
