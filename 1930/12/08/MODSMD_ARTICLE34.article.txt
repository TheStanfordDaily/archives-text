# GRATUITOUSLY INSULTING

It's "high linu' for suppression" ;it our collets, especially of
"hoy writers and editors who unduly speak their minds in publi
cations thai more or less represent the university." believes I larrv 15.
Smith, sports editor of the San I rancisco Chronicle.
()f course, he's referring to the Pay Region's most interesting
collegiate encounters, those between the (. Diversity of California
r.xeeutive t ommittee and The Daily California)} and The Occident.
Latest reports from the Berkeley institution tell of the a])pointment
of a sub-committee to devise ways and means whereby student edi
tors having the audacity to think can he made to keep their thoughts
to themselves whenever deemed advisable by the California Lxecu
tive Committee.
The "Leading Paper of the Pacific (oast" likes that proposal. At
least, the Chronicle's Marry does, lie gives it his official sanction,
-agely remarking: "That is certainly as it should be."
"Lor an editor of a college paper who speaks his mind honestly
and fairly." he continues, "one can have only respect, even though
it is felt that his judgment is bad. Put when a 'cub' gratuitously
insults a fellow university in matters over which that university has
absolutely no control it is high time that the budding young literary
genius be told where he can 'head in at'."
The Daily is glad that I tarry is able to distinguish between, as
he would say, speaking one's mind honestly and fairly, and gratui
tously insulting another university. The Daily has to confess its
inability to tell which of California's editorials are motivated bv
honest intentions and which by the desire to insult.
It is not strange that with such power »>f discernment I larrv l'».
Smith immediate]} saw the wisdom of California's efforts to make
iis editors shut up.
Despite the fact that the California P.xecutivc Committee seems
to be contemplating absolute censorship, despite the fact that such a
plan would mean the end of the expression of California student
opinion, despite the fact that Mr. Smith has ever championed the
cause of freedom of the press when it was his own paper that was
concerned, he did not hesitate to advocate the suppression of uni
versitv opinion.
Put then one can't be gratuitously insulting and get away with it.
So let's give a big six for the new California sub-commit tee and a
skvroekct or two for discerning I larrv.
