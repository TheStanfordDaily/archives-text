# STORM CLOUDS THREATEN

### 
Storm clouds may gather over Los Anodes today when officials '
of the I'antic ( Hast ( 'on fen nee gather there to arrange 1931 sched
ules, revise rules, and perhaps hlast open the alleged professionalism
< barges that have lieen hovering over the league during the past
month.
Although the Stanford delegates. Professor William Owens,
president ol the conference, and Alfred Masters, general manager
of the Hoard of \thletic Control, solemnly averred on the eve of 1
their departure for the southern city, that an investigation of Coast
football was unlikely, rumor has it that a discussion of such an
investigation may dominate the meeting.
Who can guess what such an investigation might reveal? Of
course, it would deal particularly with Southern California, which
has heen the suh-rosa target of most of the charges thus far. It C
po>sible that a ( oast-wise probe might uncover juicy bits of scandal
about am Conference institution, even including Stanford.
Perhaps it would be best to order such an investigation and at- (
tempt to settle at once spoken and unspoken enmity between con
ference members. I lowcver, it is quite possible that an investigation
would prove little, and accomplish nothing save to stir up further 1
antagonism.
< )ne item of business that is of particular interest to Stanford is
the proposal that California alternate each year with Stanford in
scheduling the Southern California game in late season. Many feel
that the slow-developing W arner team would have a better chance
against Howard (ones' men if the contest were plaved in November I
instead of < )ctober.
This year's conference meeting promises to be a most interesting
event. The results will be eagerly awaited by Pacific Coast intercol
legiate sports fans.
