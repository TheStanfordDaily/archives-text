Till: EDWAKDIANS. By V. Sack
villc-West. Douhleday, tlorai
N. V. 1930. At the Palo Alto
Book .Shop.)
Surrounded by the gay dash of the
: tradition and aristocracy which sang
its swan song in the reign of Edward
' VII, Sebastian, Duke of Chevron,
resented the artificiality of his so
ciety, of his mother's friends, of his
own life, while enyiying its glamor.
At the age of twenty-six, ready to
surrender to his posiijon, which had
struck him with its full force at the
coronation ceremony, he meets again
one of the few realists of that period,
who offers escape through a scien
tific expedition to South America.
Using a gay, bantering, ironic al
most to the point of satiric tone,
the author gives a vivid pictur.' of
England just before the war crum
pled its traditions. A few of. her
characters, Sebastian included, real
ize that such a blow at traditions is
approaching. Viola, Sebastian's sis
t ter, is one of the first of English
ladies to aid it. She is as interesting
as Sebastian, but because it is Se
bastian's book, she seldom appears.
It is a period little exploited in
literature that is presented, a period
j utterly fascinating for snobbishly in
clined individuals, utterly delightful
to the reader. Only an artistic writer
can satisfy so completely. —J. N.
PO' BRUCKA. By Gertrude Math-'
ews and Samuel Gaiilard Stoncy.
Macmillan, New York. (At the
Stanford Bookstore.)
Po' Brucka. a Southern term for
"white trash," is an unusually in
teresting story of the South. How
ever, the tale loses some of its ex
cellence due to the inartistic style
of narration. It impresses one as a j
hodge-podge of material that lacks
any continuity.
I Three characters are well drawn.
There is Burty Grunson, a youth of
an uncertain white, Indian, and
negro origin; and Judith Beaufain,
daughter of an old Carolina family,
who marries Barty without discov
ering his mongrel origin. Lastly,

! there is Useful, negro woman-ser
! vant of Judith, whose hatred of
Barty aroused by an unerring negro
instinct which senses that Barty is
;no more than "po* brucka" finally
| leads to the climax of the story.
The book ends with Barty, in a
dunken stupor, killing Judith's
brother; Judith's burning of the
family mansion to destroy the body
and her fleeing from the place to
escape Barty; the latter's realization
that he can never amount to more
I than po' white trash or nigger.

JUST IMAGINE. At (lie New Stan
ford Theatre.
Having practically exhausted
present-day topics, the talkies now
| show us the world in 1980! Of course
I there is the trip to Mar.-!, whole
meals in one little pill, gigantic sky
; scrapers and streams of airplanes.
All that would seem enough for
most pictures, but "Just Imagine"
actually has a plot, good songs, ex
. ccllent actors, and E! Brendel. Bren
del's song is undoubtedly the best
bit in the whole show.
"Just Imagine" is very well pro
duced. The sets of New York are re
: markable even if they must be
miniatures. The dancing and singing
i are beautifully done and the smallest
details are not overlooked. All in
i all, a highly entertaining picture.

j ONLY SAPS WORK—At the Varsity
Theatre.
For a side-splitting comedy that.
I borders on slapstick but still is
j clever enough not to be silly, see
| "Only Saps Work," now unreeling
! at the Varsity.
j It is a Leon Errol film from start
to finish, the limber-kneed come
dian furnishing the bulk of the far
cical action, at the same time pre
venting it from lapsing into asininity.
Whenever Errol shows tip, the
nit-wit Erwin fills in the breach,
while for background the lovely
Mary Brian and Richard Arlen fur
nish a delightful romance. —L. C.
