## PRAISE BE HE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
During the general course of the
publicity received by the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, the name of
1 Leland R. Long lias been left out of
the group of organizers.
Although not in school now, he is
responsible for about one-fourth of
the success the orchestra has en
joyed in the past, and is enjoying
1 this year. As a sincere and able 1
musician, Mr. Long was in a position
last year to give the orchestra strong
support as principal cellist of the
1 cello section; and, us a genuine lover i

of music, he did his part in the real ;
hard work of organization necessary i
for the success of such an orchestra. !
Few people realize how much
work is done on a thing of this kind j
that never shows upon the surface,
and here is a typical case of a fine J
recognition.
The members of the orchestra miss
both the large, dependable tone of j
his cello and his generous person
ality, and are hoping that it will be
possible for him to be back in his j
old place next year.
Sincerely,
Bourne G. Eaton.
