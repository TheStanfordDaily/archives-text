# LOOKING AROUND

A marriage questionnaire answered
by U.C.L.A. co-eds reveals that
Stanford men rate in popularity
above S.C. or even Bruin males. The
Southern Pacific will probably run
special trains to the South this vaca
tion.
What can our popularity with
the Uclan women be due to?
Our own "500" claim that we are
just "roughs" in manner and
dress. An explanation that
should please half a thousand
persons of this campus is that
the U.C.L.A. co-eds rate Stan
lord men high because they only
see them a few weeks each year.
Senator Ham Lewis, noted for
pink v/hiskers and spats, claims in
an interview with the Princeton
daily that American colleges are
nursing houses for athletes and so
ciety blooms.
Evidently the Senator has been
seeing some of those "College Come
dies" again. No doubt there are nu
merous athletes and social butter
flies flitting about any campus; but
there are also some students that
are coming for an education.
And. if collegians do play football
and do have a good time on week
ends, it is no indication that they
are not studying.
The Dean of Lehigh Univer
sity claims that a college edu
cation gives one a sense of self
confidence.
That is no doubt a great asset:
but what a great many business
men are claiming is that college
graduates feel that they are the
most intelligent people in the
world and are trying to beat
that record.
A professor at Columbia Univer
sity states that reading books for
pleasure and talking after midnight
are two highly desirable extra-cur
ricular activities. The professor is
correct.
But what many people forget is
that after reading such highly ex
citing things as "Elements of Human
Psychology," "Foundations of Amer
ican Nationality," etc., the average
college student needs rest to re
cover his nervous equilibrium.
Derbies, spats, and canes are the
order of the day for campus dress
at the University of Ohio. One might
wonder what they wear when they
are "stepping out."
Dirty cords and sweatshirts
may not go well with the fur
coats and sport ensembles of
western co-eds. but the western
college man's dress is more ap
propriate, more comfortable, and
shows more independence than
that of his eastern cousins.
