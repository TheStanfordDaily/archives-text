# Cabbages and Things

### 
Wonder of wonders has happened
i right "under our pedagogic noses.
' The women gave a carnival, and
people attended it. They spent dimes,
and threw things, to their hearts'
content. Roughs came with bulging
pockets, and left with anything from
manicure sets to doll dishes tied
• around their stiff necks.
Our only hope is that someone
j is suffering a severe case of in
digestion, this morning—who
ever it was who made away
with the ten-pound box of candy j
intended as a raffle prize. Or
maybe that was part of the
committee's plan, to have the
box mysteriously disappear, and
then take it back where it came
from, for a refund? Probably
wasn't good, anyway.
Even the orchestra was charitable,
I and gave the whole evening of
music for sweet Athletic's sake.
' Funny, too, when the new gym isn't
going to do the men a bit of good.
Of course, the new building is
• more secluded than ever; but wood- I

! pecker- and knot-holes in the wall
jaround the women's swimming pool
! will gel a rest from over-use, at
least.
We have it on good authority that
j a group of responsible souls met
j after the carnival was over, and
> decided upon the central motif for
i decoration of the dancing room in
j the gym:
A man with a block "S" on
his sweater stands with a ping
pong racket in one hand, and a
I bowling ball in the other. (One
knows instinctively that his
score will go to help KAT.)
Bacchus hovers in the hack
ground, to lend the proper
mythological, etherical atmos
phere. Absolute propriety is as
sured by a group of cbaperones,
who sip coffee back in one cor
ner.
A perfect fresco (not to be con
fused with fiasco), we calls it. Try
one on your memorial belfry tower,
along with the other batty ideas . . .
