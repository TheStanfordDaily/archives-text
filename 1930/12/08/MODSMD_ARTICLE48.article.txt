## WE TOLD YOU SO 
### 
Hail to Knute Kenneth Itockin
and liis Ramblers Trom South Bene
and Notre Dame, champions of thest
United States in all matters of ant
pertaining to football! Coming
through with flying colors after ar
ranging what had been termed j
suicide schedule, Itockne took team;
as they came, until now there an
no more to come.
If you will pardon us while wc
pat ourselves on the back, we wil
quote from Friday morning's Daily
"Wf pick Knute and his second edi
tion of the Ibanez quartet to stam
pede the Thundering Herd. We ex
pect the; South Bend tackles to Odi
ously impede (split infinitive, par
don us) the progress of the far
famed Jones power plays. The
Roeknemen will pass over the head*
of the Headman's backfiel !."
All of which makes us, along with
AI Santoro, a member of the minor
ity of sports scribes who picked the
winner of last Saturdays debacle
So complete was Notre Dame's tri
umph, so consistent was the success
of Itockne. that there is absolutely
no question in the minds of the foot
ball public as to who wins the na
tional championship for the season
of 1930.
Most surprising o.C all the numer
ous features of the game is the
superior man-power which the
South Bend squad showed. Hit b>
the loss of Joe Savoleli and ''Mejon'
Mullins, two of the outstanding full
backs in the country, canny Knute
reached deep within his sejuad tc
pull out O'Connor, an unknown whe:
rambled 80 yards to a touchdown
What an outfit!
We are prone to suspect, however,
that the U.S.C. team which facet!
Stanford and the Trojans who facet!
Notre Dame were two different out
fits. Reaching their peak against the
Kedshirts and the Bears, the Car
dinal and Gold team shot their watl
before the Epic Encounter. And an
other thing—we are also prone tii
suspect that Washington Slate will
not fare so well on New Year's Day
in Pasadena.
While the Dartmouth-Stanford
fooiball game is still fresh in every
body's minds, the question of Dana's
penalty, given when Albertson en
tered the game, brings up a sug
gestion to avoiel similar occurrences.
It seems that the penalty arose be
cause play had already started be
fore Albertson caught Dana's eye.
Being just brimming over with
bright ideas these cool mornings,
and also being aided by none other
than Don Liebendorfer, we rise to
suggest that a noise-machine be in
stalled on each team's bench to be
operated as soon as a substitute en
ters the playing field.
To elucidate: Place a siren on the
bench with an assistant to the as
sistant referee as operator. Now let
a player set foot upon playing ter
ritory, and the official sounds a
siren, thereby telling the referee
that there are twelve men on the
field. Result: No question whether a
penalty is merited or not.
In all seriousness, such a device
is well worth while. In the first
place, it would clearly indicate to
officials on the iieltl that a substitute
was entering the game. Since offi
cials oftentimes are not watching
the bench for substitutes, it would
call their attention to the entering
player.
In the second place, with sound
r'fleets accompanying newcomers to
the fray, the officers could concen
trate more efficiently upon the play
and not be watching out of the cor
ners of their eyes for substitutions.
And another thing. The football
rules are meticulous in protecting
kickers after they have booted the
bail, but modified murder may be
committed on the passers. Doth men,
the kicker and the passer, are in
comparable positions—alone and un
protected in a world filled with fast
charging linesmen.
As matters now stand, a passer
must shift for himself and duck the
impending disasters as they come;
the kicker is sacred, and whosoever
touches a hair of his head brings a
15-yard penalty upon his team. Is
this Justice? Or Mercy?
Watching the beating passers take
in game after game, in the interests
of humanity we are moved to rise
and protest. If the kicker is pro
tected. for heaven's sake protect the
passer. Add a statute to the rule
book, the bible of football, making
it a misdemeanor to muss the passer,
and all will be well.
Morton, Dartmouth's star halfback,
is generally given credit for scoring
the Green's touchdown against Stan
lord. It seems that Morton hit the
line and fumbled on the touehdc>wn
play, the ball rolling over the goal
line where a guard fell upon it to
count six points for the men of Can
nell. And that is how close Dnrt
mouth came to not making their
touchelown. Hot copy, by cracky!

All of which makes us, along with

ity of sports scribes who picked the
winner of last Saturdays debacle
So complete was Notre Dame's tri
umph, so consistent was the success
of Itockne. that there is absolutely
no question in the minds of the foot
ball public as to who wins the na
tional championship for the season
of 1930.
Most surprising o.C all the numer
ous features of the game is the
superior man-power which the
South Bend squad showed. Hit b>
the loss of Joe Savoleli and ''Mejon'
Mullins, two of the outstanding full
backs in the country, canny Knute
reached deep within his sejuad tc
pull out O'Connor, an unknown whe:
rambled 80 yards to a touchdown
What an outfit!
We are prone to suspect, however,
that the U.S.C. team which facet!
Stanford and the Trojans who facet!
Notre Dame were two different out
fits. Reaching their peak against the
Kedshirts and the Bears, the Car
dinal and Gold team shot their watl
before the Epic Encounter. And an
other thing—we are also prone tii
suspect that Washington Slate will
not fare so well on New Year's Day
in Pasadena.
While the Dartmouth-Stanford
fooiball game is still fresh in every
body's minds, the question of Dana's
penalty, given when Albertson en
tered the game, brings up a sug
gestion to avoiel similar occurrences.
It seems that the penalty arose be
cause play had already started be
fore Albertson caught Dana's eye.
Being just brimming over with
bright ideas these cool mornings,
and also being aided by none other
than Don Liebendorfer, we rise to
suggest that a noise-machine be in
stalled on each team's bench to be
operated as soon as a substitute en
ters the playing field.
To elucidate: Place a siren on the
bench with an assistant to the as
sistant referee as operator. Now let
a player set foot upon playing ter
ritory, and the official sounds a
siren, thereby telling the referee
that there are twelve men on the
field. Result: No question whether a
penalty is merited or not.
In all seriousness, such a device
is well worth while. In the first
place, it would clearly indicate to
officials on the iieltl that a substitute
was entering the game. Since offi
cials oftentimes are not watching
the bench for substitutes, it would
call their attention to the entering
player.
In the second place, with sound
r'fleets accompanying newcomers to
the fray, the officers could concen
trate more efficiently upon the play
and not be watching out of the cor
ners of their eyes for substitutions.
And another thing. The football
rules are meticulous in protecting
kickers after they have booted the
bail, but modified murder may be
committed on the passers. Doth men,
the kicker and the passer, are in
comparable positions—alone and un
protected in a world filled with fast
charging linesmen.
As matters now stand, a passer
must shift for himself and duck the
impending disasters as they come;
the kicker is sacred, and whosoever
touches a hair of his head brings a
15-yard penalty upon his team. Is
this Justice? Or Mercy?
Watching the beating passers take
in game after game, in the interests
of humanity we are moved to rise
and protest. If the kicker is pro
tected. for heaven's sake protect the
passer. Add a statute to the rule
book, the bible of football, making
it a misdemeanor to muss the passer,
and all will be well.
Morton, Dartmouth's star halfback,
is generally given credit for scoring
the Green's touchdown against Stan
lord. It seems that Morton hit the
line and fumbled on the touehdc>wn
play, the ball rolling over the goal
line where a guard fell upon it to
count six points for the men of Can
nell. And that is how close Dnrt
mouth came to not making their
touchelown. Hot copy, by cracky!

backs in the country, canny Knute
reached deep within his sejuad tc
pull out O'Connor, an unknown whe:
rambled 80 yards to a touchdown
What an outfit!
We are prone to suspect, however,
that the U.S.C. team which facet!
Stanford and the Trojans who facet!
Notre Dame were two different out
fits. Reaching their peak against the
Kedshirts and the Bears, the Car
dinal and Gold team shot their watl
before the Epic Encounter. And an
other thing—we are also prone tii
suspect that Washington Slate will
not fare so well on New Year's Day
in Pasadena.
While the Dartmouth-Stanford
fooiball game is still fresh in every
body's minds, the question of Dana's
penalty, given when Albertson en
tered the game, brings up a sug
gestion to avoiel similar occurrences.
It seems that the penalty arose be
cause play had already started be
fore Albertson caught Dana's eye.
Being just brimming over with
bright ideas these cool mornings,
and also being aided by none other
than Don Liebendorfer, we rise to
suggest that a noise-machine be in
stalled on each team's bench to be
operated as soon as a substitute en
ters the playing field.
To elucidate: Place a siren on the
bench with an assistant to the as
sistant referee as operator. Now let
a player set foot upon playing ter
ritory, and the official sounds a
siren, thereby telling the referee
that there are twelve men on the
field. Result: No question whether a
penalty is merited or not.
In all seriousness, such a device
is well worth while. In the first
place, it would clearly indicate to
officials on the iieltl that a substitute
was entering the game. Since offi
cials oftentimes are not watching
the bench for substitutes, it would
call their attention to the entering
player.
In the second place, with sound
r'fleets accompanying newcomers to
the fray, the officers could concen
trate more efficiently upon the play
and not be watching out of the cor
ners of their eyes for substitutions.
And another thing. The football
rules are meticulous in protecting
kickers after they have booted the
bail, but modified murder may be
committed on the passers. Doth men,
the kicker and the passer, are in
comparable positions—alone and un
protected in a world filled with fast
charging linesmen.
As matters now stand, a passer
must shift for himself and duck the
impending disasters as they come;
the kicker is sacred, and whosoever
touches a hair of his head brings a
15-yard penalty upon his team. Is
this Justice? Or Mercy?
Watching the beating passers take
in game after game, in the interests
of humanity we are moved to rise
and protest. If the kicker is pro
tected. for heaven's sake protect the
passer. Add a statute to the rule
book, the bible of football, making
it a misdemeanor to muss the passer,
and all will be well.
Morton, Dartmouth's star halfback,
is generally given credit for scoring
the Green's touchdown against Stan
lord. It seems that Morton hit the
line and fumbled on the touehdc>wn
play, the ball rolling over the goal
line where a guard fell upon it to
count six points for the men of Can
nell. And that is how close Dnrt
mouth came to not making their
touchelown. Hot copy, by cracky!

Hail to Knute Kenneth Itockin
and liis Ramblers Trom South Bene
and Notre Dame, champions of thest
United States in all matters of ant
pertaining to football! Coming
through with flying colors after ar
ranging what had been termed j
suicide schedule, Itockne took team;
as they came, until now there an
no more to come.
If you will pardon us while wc
pat ourselves on the back, we wil
quote from Friday morning's Daily
"Wf pick Knute and his second edi
tion of the Ibanez quartet to stam
pede the Thundering Herd. We ex
pect the; South Bend tackles to Odi
ously impede (split infinitive, par
don us) the progress of the far
famed Jones power plays. The
Roeknemen will pass over the head*
of the Headman's backfiel !."
All of which makes us, along with
AI Santoro, a member of the minor
ity of sports scribes who picked the
winner of last Saturdays debacle
So complete was Notre Dame's tri
umph, so consistent was the success
of Itockne. that there is absolutely
no question in the minds of the foot
ball public as to who wins the na
tional championship for the season
of 1930.
Most surprising o.C all the numer
ous features of the game is the
superior man-power which the
South Bend squad showed. Hit b>
