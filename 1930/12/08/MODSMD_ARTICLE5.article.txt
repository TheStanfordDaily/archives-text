# PROHIBITION AGENTS TO BE INSTRUCTED IN ENFORCING LAW
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dcc. 7. (/P> â€”
Schools for federal prohibition
agents will open tomorrow in 12
cities to give instruction in the best
means of enforcing the dry laws.
Classes will be held under the di
rection of 24 instructors trained in
Washington, and at their close, De
cember 20, will have constituted the
fourth series of such schools held
by Prohibition Director Woodcock
in an effort to secure a complete
corps of agents expertly equipped to
enforce prohibition.
Harry M. Dengler, chief of the
prohibition bureau's division of
schools, explained it was planned
to continue such classes at three
week intervals until next July.
At that time, he estimated, all the
federal agents will have received in
struction in their own rights under
the law, how to secure evidence
properly, and how not to trespass
on rights of citizens.
