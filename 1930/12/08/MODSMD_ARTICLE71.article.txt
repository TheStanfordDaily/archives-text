# FIRST SYMPHONY OF BEETHOVEN WILL BE PLAYED AT CONCERT
## 
### 
Beethoven's "First Symphony" is j
| to be the main presentation of the ;
J Stanford Symphony Orchestra at its j
first concert of the school year i
! Wednesday evening at 8:15 o'clock. I
! Although Beethoven is greatly in- i
; fluenced by classic masters and j
! clings chiefly to the accepted musical |
form in his "First Symphony," there ■
I are parts where he breaks away !
from tradition and attempts to ex- j
press himself in absolutely new !
j ways.
The introductory adagio with full I
orchestra, of the first movement, j
moves into allegro, where there is !
| an extraordinary use of dynamics, I
! the changes from forte to piano j
! being sudden and abrupt.
The second and third movements j
are the most important. The second j
j starts with the utmost grace and j
delicacy, the theme being played by j
i the second violins. Then one by one j
i the various voices enter, playing the !
i same theme. In this movement I
| Beethoven introduces an innovation ]
; by using the kettle drum as a kind !
I of metronome. The part closes with
| dynamic contrasts. The third move
ment is bright and sprightly. In it
Beethoven develops the Scherzo and
Trio, impressing it with his own in
dividuality.
The last movement, opening with
! a few bars of adagio, changes to a
j rapid and dainty vivace for violins,
i It is particularly difficult to play.
