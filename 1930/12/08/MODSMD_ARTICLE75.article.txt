# PHYSICAL EDUCATION MINOR FOR WOMEN WILL BE INSTITUTED
## 
### 
j A new course, a minor in physi- j
] cal education, will be offered next ,
| quarter by the Department of Physi- i
i cal Education for Women for stu- |
I dents interested in becoming teach- I
I ers in that field, according to an an
j nouncement received from that de- j
j partment recently.
"Since so many teachers of aca- '
: demic subjects have been pressed I
j into service by the physical educa- |
'tion departments of various smaller j
j schools throughout the state without j
; any specialized training along these
j lines, it was thought advisable to j
I provide Stanford women interested I
iin teaching with this knowledge," ;
j said Dr. Bertha S. Dyment, Medical
j Adviser of Women.
"This year we are attempting to
I organize a department minor only, j
| but if sufficient interest is shown by j
! the students, we hope in time to be i
! able to offer a major in Physical
I Education Instruction with the added
J facilities of the new gymnasium." |
All women interested in the for
j mation of this branch of activity are j
requested to meet Miss Gertrude!
i Hawley, acting director of Roble i
I Gymnasium, Thursday at 4 o'clock
! at the gymnasium.
