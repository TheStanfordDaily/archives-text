# BELGIAN QUEEN VISITS POISON FOG VICTIMS
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Dec. 7. </P>â€”Queen
Elizabeth of the Belgians, accom
panied by her staff, visited the
| death-stricken villages of the Meuse
, Valley today, entering the homes of
several of the sick and sympathizing
j with the bereaved.
| Her Majesty and Red Cross dele- j
j gates listened to the stories of the i
; slowly recovering victims who told
of an intense prickling sensation in
. the throat immediately after they
| entered what they called the poison
ous fog.
Three more deaths, bringing the
total to 67, and the fact that many
i still are suffering despite the lifting
of the fog, were advanced as an
argument that the deaths were
i caused by noxious fumes released j
! from an industrial plant.
