### 
When the undefeated touch foot
ball teams of Delta Tau Delta and
Sigma Chi clash tomorrow for the j
intramural championship, they will
Ibe playing not only for glory but
for charity as a result of their reso- '
t lution to charge admission to the
game and give the proceeds to the '
Women's Gymnasium fund.
Permission has been obtained to
play the game on the varsity prac
tice gridh'on at 3 o'clock, and a
charge of 25 cents per person will
be made for admission.
Two Strong Teams
Those whom partisanship, charity,
or curiosity move to attend the con
i test will see in action two fine touch j
football teams. Survivors of a field 1
of 24 starters, both are unbeaten by
i any opponent and victorious in seven j
games.
In winning the champiqjiship of
league II and disposing of Theta
Chi and Alpha Kappa Lambda, the j
respective leaders of leagues I and '
V, the Delts have rolled up a total
[ of 132 points while holding their op
ponents to 6. Their forte has been !
a running attack; their stars Twelve
i trees, Werder, Nichols. Fine inter
ference has enabledi this trio to
utilize their speed to great advantage
: in sweeps around end.
Sigma Chi's Use Passes
I After winning the championship
i of their own league, Sigma Chi dis
posed of Sigma Nu, league Ill's lead
er. Their forte has been overhead
attack with Joujon-Roche as re- !
ceiver and Kelly as the passer. The
latter's ability to run the ball also
has made this combination a thorn
I in the side of the opposition.
In their meeting with the Delts to
-1 morrow the Sigma Chi's will be
matching passing and deception [
against power and speed.
