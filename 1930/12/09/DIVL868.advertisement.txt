The GIFT CHARMING
Is sure to bear the Livingston cachet of elegance and
good taste. Exquisite bits of costume jewelry—French
pearls, crystals and semi-precious stones. Sheer linen
'kerchiefs imported from France, Ireland and Maderia to
give a charming personal touch to your Christmas card.
Exotic French perfumes in their fascinating bottles. In
effable handsome silk lingerie that any girl would find
irresistible. Cobwebby silk chiffon hosiery with gayly
colored picot tops. And countless other gifts—you'll find
their expense in no way comes up to the delight they're
bound to give the recipients.
