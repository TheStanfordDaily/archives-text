## Mural Finalists Clash On Varsity Field Today At 3 O'Clock DELTS PICKED TO WIN 
### 
"Intramural touch football cham
pions" will be the title at stake in
this afternoon's clash between the
teams of Delta Tau Delta and Sigma
Chi at 3 o'clock on the varsity grid
iron.
Following the University's lead,
both teams have decided to play the
game for charity. Whatever money
is collected from the 25 cent admis
sion charge will be turned over to
the Women's Gymnasium fund. Co
eds, roughs, professors and students
are urged to attend.
Impressive Records
Both the Delts and the Sigma Chi's
have compiled impressive records in
winning their way to the finals. They
are the survivors of a starting field
of 24 teams and the winners of six
straight games. Because of a steam
roller running attack displayed in
their recent victories Delta Tau Delta
rules as a favorite in today's clash.
Starting the season with a 7-6 de
cision over Sequoia I, they waxed
steadily stronger, defeating El
Campo, 14-0, Kappa Alpha, 33-0,
Alpha Delta Phi, 20-0, and Phi Gam
ma Delta, 33-0 to win their league
championship. The strong Delta Chi
team, winners of league I, the next
victim, 6-0, and in their latest tri
umph, the Delts swamped the
A.K.L.'s, also league champions, 19-0.
To sum up, in seven games they have
scored 132 points, their opponents 6.
Sigma Chi Fading
Sigma Chi displayed such a scoring
punch in the early game as to install
themselves as favorites for the uni
versity title, but their last two starts
were not as impressive. They barely
succeeded in holding Sequoia II to a
6-6 tie, but were awarded the game
on account of an eligibility question;
they beat Sigma Nu, 13-12, by keep
ing possession of the ball in the
closing minutes of the second half.
Stars for the Delts have been
Twelvetrees, Werder, and Nichols;
luminaries for the Sigma Chi's Kelly
and Joujon-Roche. The Delts forte
has been their running attack, while
the Sigma Chi's depend largely upon
passes. The keynote of the Delt suc
cess is speed; deception has played a
major part in the Sigma Chi wins.
Their encounter consequently will
be a clash of opposites.

straight games. Because of a steam
roller running attack displayed in
their recent victories Delta Tau Delta
rules as a favorite in today's clash.
Starting the season with a 7-6 de
cision over Sequoia I, they waxed
steadily stronger, defeating El
Campo, 14-0, Kappa Alpha, 33-0,
Alpha Delta Phi, 20-0, and Phi Gam
ma Delta, 33-0 to win their league
championship. The strong Delta Chi
team, winners of league I, the next
victim, 6-0, and in their latest tri
umph, the Delts swamped the
A.K.L.'s, also league champions, 19-0.
To sum up, in seven games they have
scored 132 points, their opponents 6.
Sigma Chi Fading
Sigma Chi displayed such a scoring
punch in the early game as to install
themselves as favorites for the uni
versity title, but their last two starts
were not as impressive. They barely
succeeded in holding Sequoia II to a
6-6 tie, but were awarded the game
on account of an eligibility question;
they beat Sigma Nu, 13-12, by keep
ing possession of the ball in the
closing minutes of the second half.
Stars for the Delts have been
Twelvetrees, Werder, and Nichols;
luminaries for the Sigma Chi's Kelly
and Joujon-Roche. The Delts forte
has been their running attack, while
the Sigma Chi's depend largely upon
passes. The keynote of the Delt suc
cess is speed; deception has played a
major part in the Sigma Chi wins.
Their encounter consequently will
be a clash of opposites.
"Intramural touch football cham
pions" will be the title at stake in
this afternoon's clash between the
teams of Delta Tau Delta and Sigma
Chi at 3 o'clock on the varsity grid
iron.
Following the University's lead,
both teams have decided to play the
game for charity. Whatever money
is collected from the 25 cent admis
sion charge will be turned over to
the Women's Gymnasium fund. Co
eds, roughs, professors and students
are urged to attend.
Impressive Records
Both the Delts and the Sigma Chi's
have compiled impressive records in
winning their way to the finals. They
are the survivors of a starting field
of 24 teams and the winners of six
straight games. Because of a steam
