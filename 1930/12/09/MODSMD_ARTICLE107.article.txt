# W.A.A SOPHS WIN BASKETBALL TILT FROM YEARLINGS
## Juniors And Seniors Clash Today In Final Game Of Season 
### 
Scoring 24 points in the first half
alone, and outplaying the yearlings
all over the court, second year
women yesterday afternoon sent
their opponents to a sorry defeat,
3G-8, in their last game on the W.A.A.
basketball series.
Though the team work of the
sophomore sextette was vastly su
perior to that of the freshmen, it
was evident that the height of the
forwards was of great assistance to
them in eluding their shorter guards.
Ruth Fisher played an outstanding
game at jump center, and Helen
' 112 Ullmann and Louise Hudson at
guard. Mary Katherine Morris with
her usual accuracy was high point
scorer of the tilt.
