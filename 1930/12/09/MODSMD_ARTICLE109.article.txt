# DR. SCHENCK SEES VAST OIL RESERVE IN RECENT STRIKE
## Stanford Graduates First To Survey Lost Hills Petroleum Area 
### 
Recent discovery of tremendous
supplies of gas and high-grade grav
ity oil in the Lost Hills, Kern
county, east of Bakersfield, indicates
that the national demand can be met
for an unlimited period, according
to Dr. Hubert Schenck of the geol
ogy department. The newest "strike"
is at the Universal Consolidatcd's
deep-test well.
"Two Stanford geologists predicted
in 1910 the occurrence of light grav
ity oil and of oil at greater depths
than it v/as then possible to drill for.
Ralph Arnold, Los Angeles geol
ogist, and Robert Andexson, now in
Algeria, in that year made the first
and most complete report on the
Kettleman Hills-Lost Hills region in
a U.S. Geological Survey bulletin,"
Professor Schenck said. "Not until
1928 was extensive development of
deep sand wells in the north dome of
Kettleman Hills begun by the Mil
ham Exploration Company."
Professor Schenck is familiar with
the region, having investigated its
possibilities for the Standard Oil
Company of California, for which
he is consulting geologist. He spent
six months of 1929 in detailed field
work on the west side of the valley.
