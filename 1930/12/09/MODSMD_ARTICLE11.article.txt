# ALL QUAD PHOTOS DUE BY SATURDAY
## 
### 
With 300 Quad photographs still
to be taken, appointments with the
photographer may be made all this
week, at the Quad desk in the Old
Union in the mornings, and by
phoning P.A. 3308 in the afternoons,
according to Cameron Wolfe, Quad
editor.
Seniors and members of living and
eating groups, who have not already
done so, are advised by Wolfe to
make appointments as soon as pos
sible in order to avoid waiting.
