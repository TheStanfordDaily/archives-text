# LAVAL TO ATTEMPT FORMATION OF NEW CABINET IN FRANCE
## 
### 
PARIS, Doc. 8 (/P.). â€”A newcomer
in leading French political roles, '
Senator Pierre Laval, noted lawyer, j
worked feverishly here tonight to i
construct a government where an 1
older hand had failed.
Invited today by President Dou- |
merque to form a cabinet, after the
efforts of Senator Louis Barthou had
failed, Laval was meeting with dif- j
ficulties similar to those encountered j
by his veteran colleague.
The veto of the Dadical Socialist '
Party against inclusion of any mem- ,
her of the Right in the new com- j
bination was renewed and as in the !
Barthou case apparently was the
stiffest obstacle for Laval to negoti
ate on his way to the premiership.
His advantage, it was pointed by
his close friends, lay in his decision
not to insist upon the entrance to ,
the government of a member "of the j
Right" parties as Barthou had done. !
The Right group advocates religious '
training in public schools.
