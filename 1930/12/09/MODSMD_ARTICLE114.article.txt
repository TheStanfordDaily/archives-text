# PALO ALTO COUNCIL PASSES RESOLUTION FOR SAFETY GATES
## 
### 
By a unanimous resolution Palo
Alto city council last night ratified
the State Railroad Commission's
plan for the installation of auto
matic gates at the Churchill avenue
crossing. They also agreed to share
with the Southern Pacific Railroad
the expense of a watchman until
the gate is installed.
The plan agreed on calls for the
payment by the city of $1,000 as its
share of the gate, the remainder and
the cost of upkeep to be supplied
by the railroad. The Southern Pacific
also agreed to pay the full salary of
the watchman if he had to be re
tained longer than six weeks, which
is the specified time for the in
stalling of the gates.
The city council's resolution grew
out of a meeting yesterday morning
of the State Railroad Commission at

which the plan was proposed. The
meeting followed counter-charges
exchanged between the railroad and
Mayor C. H. Christensen regarding
responsibility of delays in putting in
gates. The exchange came as the
result of the collision between an
automobile and the "Lark'' at the
Churchill crossing last Wednesday
which resulted in the death of Mrs.
A. V. Christianson and her daugh
ter, Betty Jane.
