# ALL INDIA WAITS FOR CONFERENCE DECISION
## 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 8 (IP).â€” Hope and
anxiety alternate in India regarding
the outcome of the round table con
ference, an official statement by the
Indian Government indicated today.
In the towns of the United Provinces
there has been agitation since the
conference here began, the state
ment says.
At St. James' Palace the confcrcncc
committees started another week's
work today, continuing their study of
the structure of a proposed federal
government for India. Among the
subjects under discussion are the
questions of defense and foreign af
fairs. It is believed likely that even
during the transition period of gov
ernmental change in India these mat
ters will not be wholly withdrawn
from federal jurisdiction.
