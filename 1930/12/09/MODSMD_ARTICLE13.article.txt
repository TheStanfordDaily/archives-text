# ROBLE SPONSOR GROUP TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY
## Pan-Hellenic Gives Decision As Rushing Problems Are Considered 
### 
Policies concerning the relation of i
; women sponsors to rushing will be
j decided upon by the sponsor group j
itself, independent of Pan-Hellenic,
i according to report from Jean Utt,
' president of Pan-Hellenic. The reso
lution to this effect was drawn up
last week by a committee appointed |
! by the president, and was read to a
general meeting of that body yester
day.
Decision was reached by Pan-Hel
lenic several weeks ago that row
; sponsors might remain in Roble Hall
during rushing and through the win
ter quarter if the group desired such
an arrangement. That the sponsor
group had decided to stay the sec
-1 ond quarter in the dormitory was an
nounced last week by Marion Strong,
head sponsor.
Plan On Trial
This is the first year that row
; sponsors will have remained in the
I hall during rushing; and the plan is
being tried largely as an experiment, j
Policies in regard to rushing will be
I decided by the sponsors themselves,
according to the decision of Pan-
Hellenic.
Dates for rushing were not set by
the meeting, but will be determined
yfter a consultation with Dean Yost,
according to Jean Utt.
That a regular alumni committee
would function in connection with
Pan-Hellenic, the latter body to have
> one member on the committee, was
also decided at yesterday's meeting.
