## 
### 
Changes in the scholarship grade
point system will be noticeable in the
next copy of the bawl-out, according
to the announcement by Mrs. M. P.
Huston, secretary of the scholarship
committee.
The purpose of the bawl-out will
be, as in the past, to indicate the ex
cess of grades above a C average, or
below.
The revised system will not affect
the student, but will facilitate office
records. As before, a C average is
required for graduation. On the
quarterly reports the grades will be
ttiven as follows: A, 4; B, 3; C, 2; D, 1;
and 0 for condition, failure, and with
drawal. Thus it is now necessary
to have twice as many grade points
as units in order to graduate.
Old grade points will not be trans
fered to the new system, but will be
indicated on the office records. The
chief advantage to the student under
the new system is that the difference
between a D and a minus is shown.
