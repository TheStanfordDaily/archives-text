# CAGE STRENGTH IS UNKNOWN AS SEASON OPENS
## Inexperienced Material Is Handicap To Bunn's New System 
### Jack Jernegan 
Since the Stanford varsity bas
ketball team will be well under way
in its 1930-31 season by the time
the Daily resumes publication and
the bulk of the students return from
the Christmas vacation, it is per
haps a good idea at this time to
make a general survey of the pos
sibilities, both favorable and un
favorable, for a successful cage sea
son.
Having a new coach with a new
system which has not been seen in
action before in this section, exccpt
in the case of a few barnstorming
middlewestern teams, Stanford is in
a very indefinite position at the
present time. No one, not even
Coach John Bunn himself probably,
knows just what to expect from the
Cardinal-clad court athletes when
they swing into action.
Unfavorable Points
On the red ink side of the list of
facts which must be considered in
relation to the Stanford prospects
there are some fairly obvious facts.
In the first place, only six letter
men are included in the squad with
which Bunn has to work, and of
those six only two were regulars
last year. Vance Fawcett and Cap
tain Mike Reynolds are the return
ing regulars, both of them now
guards, while Bud Hawkins, Don
Tyler, John Tampcke, and Jim
Mears make up the rest of the list.
Tampcke made his letter two years
ago and was not on the team last
year.
New System Used
In the second place, an entirely
new type of play must be, drilled
into the veterans who are available
and into the men from last year's
freshman squad. Bunn teaches the
"Phog" Allen system, which re
quires that certain very definite
fundamentals be learned by its ex
ponents, and the Card mentor has
had to spend most of his fall prac
tice session in work on the ABC's
of his system.
Then there is the fact that a very
large proportion of the present squad
of thirty-odd men are seniors who
are entering their last year of col
lege competition. This means that
Coach Bunn must use substitutes
freely during tilts this winter in
order to build up a nucleus of ex
perienmed men around whom to
build his 1931-32 quintet. In fact, it
must not be expected that he will
really reach full speed until next
year.
Large Squad Out
The favorable iide of the ledger
docs not present as long a list of
facts as the debit side.
In fact, at the present time about
the only things that can be said to
favor Cardinal chances arc that
Bunn may be able to pick a few
unexpected stars out of the large
squad he is using, that the fresh
man team last year was quite strong
and should furnish good material,
and that the new system may prove
baffling to Stanford's opponents,
since the University of California is
the only coast team which has pre
viously faced it.
It appears that Stanford will prob
ably have to wait another year for
a basketball team which will begin
to equal the records of Cardinal
track and football aggregations, but
the campus fans ought to see some
interesting games this season with a
five that will be no set-up.
