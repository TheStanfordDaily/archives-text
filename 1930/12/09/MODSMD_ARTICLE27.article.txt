# PADRE DIES OF HEART TROUBLE
## Father Ricard Succumbs After Long Illness 
### 
SAN JOSE, Dec. 8. (/P)â€”Father
i Jerome S. Ricard, venerable "padre
of the rains" of the University of
Santa Clara, passed away at 9:20
o'clock last night. Enfeebled by a
i year's critical illness, he suffered a
relapse last night, and sinking into
i a coma which it was feared he
i would not survive, the last rites of
! the Church were administered.
Nearing his 81st birthday, Father
Ricard had been confined to his bed
i almost continuously since last Janu
j ary of a failing heart. From January
! to September he was in O'Connor
1 Sanitarium here, when his condition
i improved sufficiently so his wish to
return to the University was grant
! ed. He was cared for at the Uni
j versity infirmary.
Ten days ago he began to fail
again, the attack culminating with
the sinking spell last night. The rites
of the Church were administered by
the Rev. Cornelius J. McCoy, presi
| dent of the University, who re
mained at his bedside throughout
the night.
