Not even the simple mechanical ritual of elevating 10 hands was
indulged in yesterday when the important problem of the relation of
women sponsors to rushing came before Pan-Hellenic.
As usual, the "committee report" was "handed clown" to a life
less, humble collection of sorority delegates who sat silent'and mo
tionless while the president proceeded to new business, assuming
the customary unanimous acceptance of the "committee report."
And not a murmur, not a stir, out of the delegates at this flagrant
violation of parliamentary order.
Regardless of whether the committee decision was a wise one,
vesterday's procedure exposed a vital flaw in the methods of Pan
llellenic. Until sororities and their delegates to Pan-Hellenic real
ize that it is their most serious duty to assert their rights and wield
the legendarv votes which they possess, Pan-1 lellenic will continue
to he pure farce.
The events of this quarter have made it obvious that something
is rotten in Pan-J lellenic.
