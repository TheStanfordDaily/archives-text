# GRID SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED BY P.C.C. FDR 1931
## Stanford Draws Difficult Program Listing 12 Games In Season U.C.L.A., U.S.C. BREAK 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 9. (/P)—The
Pacific Coast Conference today an
nounced football schedules for the
coming year. Three intersectional
games, University of Southern Cali
fornia and Notre Dame at South
Bend, Stanford and Dartmouth at
Boston, and Stanford and Minnesota
at Palo Alto are scheduled.
Stanford lined up the most diffi
cult schedule of any team at the
meeting, Warner's team agreeing to
play six conference games in addi
tion to Minnesota, Dartmouth, Santa
Clara, Olympic Club, and West Coast
Army.
At the same time, St. Mary's and
the University of Southern Cali
fornia agreed to a game on the 26th
of next September.
Other highligths, as yet unofficial,
were:
Southern California and the Uni
versity of California at Los Angeles
came to a parting of the ways and
an official gridiron break for 1931
when graduate managers of the two
universities were unable to get to
gether on a date mutually satisfac
tory.
Southern California came out of
the meeting with a stronger sched
ule lined up than Trojans faced this
year and were known still to be
seeking an intersectional game with
Southern Methodist or another
Texas university.
The Univei'sity of California at
Los Angeles took a bad mauling in
the scrambling for games and at last
reports were able to line up only
three Pacific Coast Conference
games. These were with Washing
ton, Stanford, and Ox - egon and a de
lay in announcing the official sched
ule was caused by the fact that
members of the conference were
trying to give the Bruins a more
satisfactory schedule for 1931.
