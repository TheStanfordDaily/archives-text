# HOME GROWN AND ENTERPRISING
## 
### 
< ienerous was the support given the second of the Concert Series ,
programs here last week, the appearance of Madame Kethherg, I
gifted soprano of the Metropolitan Opera Company. Now comes j
the announcement of another musical event, the last one on the l
campus this quarter, which is equally deserving of this support.
It is the second concert of the Stanford Symphony Orchestral
to be given tomorrow night in the Assembly Hall, and for which i
there will be no admission charge.
Surprising has been the development of this organization, stu-;
dent formed and largely composed of students, which gave its First >
concert last spring. That appearance of the orchestra would have
done credit to an experienced professional group, the quality of the j
concert being far above what had been most optimistically hoped fori
of the Stanford Symphony. I
Included in tomorrow night's program will be such masterpieces!
as lleethoveu's First Symphony, I'ach's Double Concerto, Mendel-j
ssohn's Ruy I Has. and Schubert's March Militaire. Stanford is,
fortunate in having the opportunity to hear such a memorable
program, played by an organization of the caliber of the Symphony.
