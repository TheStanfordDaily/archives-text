# EACH NEEDED WISER JUDGMENT
## 
### 
Former Judge I Sen 15. l.indsey, exponent of companionate mar
riage. was called names from the pulpit of America's largest cathc.-
dral Sunday; his latest book was termed "one of the most filthy,
insidious, and cleverly written pieces of propaganda ever published."
The former Colorado barrister wanted to talk back, to defend'
himself. Me chose, rather unwisely, the cathedral as the place fori
it and attempted his defense immediately after the conclusion of '
the sermon denouncing him. The bishop, who had just spoken,
preferred hymn singing and shouted for music.
I he bishop's congregation, however, desired a little action. So j
these "worshippers." as the Associated I'ress called them, rushed
upon the champion of companionate marriage, struck him with ,
( hristian ardor, and were giving him the "bum's rush" from the 1
cathedral when he was rescued bv police.
I.indsev now faces court charges of disorderly conduct, and the
bishop may have to defend himself against counter accusations of !
slander.
The ex-judge's theories may be right, and they may be wrong. !
I ! is selection of the cathedral as a suitable place for a rebuttal was
probably not too wise.
Hut regardless of the rightness or wrongncss of Lindscv's opin
ions and the propriety of his attempting to defend himself in the
church, the whole affair only points out once more the propaganda
purposes which pulpits are sometime* made to serve and the fact
that too often they are used in launching attacks against personalities
opposing the view* of the clerics concerned.
