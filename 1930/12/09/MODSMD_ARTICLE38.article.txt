MYSTERIOUS WAYE. By Percival
Christopher Wren. New York.
181 (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
P. C. Wren of "Beau Geste," etc.,
fame, has attempted a new type of
a book. Unfortunately, Mr. Wren ap
pears to be happier when writing of
the 'Foreign Legion and Africa's
deserts.
i "Mysterious Waye" is obviously a
mystery story, almost too obviously.
; The first part of the book is so un
original as to be almost a take-off
on the usual run of mystery-thrill
ers. The second half, being the life
story of this Waye, is slightly better
—it practically ends in tragedy.
| Mr. Wren, while never a great
i writer, always managed to create an
; atmosphere of color and romance.
"Mysterious Waye" has no such at
mosphere, so what is there left? Not
much! —N. J.
FIVE MASTERS. By Joseph Wood
Krulch; Jonathan Cape and
flarison Smith. $:{.51). (At the
Stanford Book Shop.)
Mr. Krutch, whose Modern Tem
per was much praised, has here
j discussed the part of five great
! mutants in making the novel what it
is today: Bocaccio, the pagan, ex
pressing frankly his pagan desires;
Cervantes, whose intended bur
lesque became serious, whose hero
became a great figure though in
tended for a clown; Richardson,
whose sentimental Pamela started
! the domestic strain in literature;

Stendahl, convinced that in the ego
lay all happiness; finally the pathetic
yet grand figure, Proust, whose Re
membrance of Things Past is so
strangely disconnected from con
temporary existence thought it deals
with the modern.
The volume is fascinating reading
—a good deal to say for ;.ny such
study—and the criticism clear, sane.
Mr. Krutch has proved himself not ,
merely a critic but also something
of a stylist, —J. S. S.
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA. At the Curran
Theatre.
Next Sunday's concert will be a j
popular program, and will include
Brahms' "Academic Festival" over- >
ture, Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll," a
Mozart symphony, Debussy's "Pe
tite" suite, and Richard Strauss's
"Don Juan." It is a more or less !
conventional program but offers a |
great deal of variety .
Last Sunday's program was as am
bitious a program as has been ,
played this season. It opened with ,
Beethoven's tone picture of the tur
bulent Coriolanus. Mishel Piastro
played the Tschoikowsky violin con
certo with , the orchestra, and was
loudly acclaimed by the audience
for his fine technique and the dy
namic way in which he played this
typically Russian work.
As a contrast to this highly emo
tional first part, the orchestra played
Brahms' thoughtful second sym
phony, and closed the program in a
calmer mood. —E. C. B.
