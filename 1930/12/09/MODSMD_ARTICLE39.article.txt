# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
The last cabbage of the crop—just
an average vegetable, without worms
or be-cocooned butterflies in the
leaves. The Things aren't doing so
j well, thank you.
If we are to believe the statistics
[ which say that more students attend
movies the week of finals than any
other time, then the Palo Alto thea
i tres had better prepare for outside
entertainment to keep the waiting
lines happy. From all reports, some
! finals are due to, descend upon us,
I and from a summary of our own
feelings, these may be the last finals
i we'll ever take at Stanford. Once
! you flunk, you're OUT, now. How
! about the good ol ddays of starched
shirt fronts, when a fellow could
make genuine use of his white cuffs,
I and a woman carried reams of notes
; about the good old days of starched
| mutton sleeve?
•.' I •
According to southern authorities,
; U.S.C. should have won the Notre
Dame game without half trying. Los

I Angeles boasts ihc two greatest foot
ball players in the world—Bob Shu
ler to kick aid Aimee Semple Mc-
Phe rson to convert.
Our contemporary life observer,
The Prowler, suggests among his list
o!' Popular Lies, the statement: "The
play will begin promptly at 8:15 |
o'clock in the Stanford Assembly
Hall."
We, being truthful if nothing else,
suggest some additions to the list*
"The examination will not take any
of you more than an hour and a
half, although it is scheduled to oc
cupy four hours." Also, that "All
things come to him who waits." It's
been a long, hard season, and we're
still waiting for sense.
So saying, may we wish you all a
very pleasant plum pudding. May
the best man find the chimney first
—And hope this isn't the end of a
beautiful friendship. Ave, vale, au
revoir, alhambra, phoenix, kansas
i city, and all points East ....

Our contemporary life observer,
The Prowler, suggests among his list
o!' Popular Lies, the statement: "The
play will begin promptly at 8:15 |
o'clock in the Stanford Assembly
Hall."
We, being truthful if nothing else,
suggest some additions to the list*
"The examination will not take any
of you more than an hour and a
half, although it is scheduled to oc
cupy four hours." Also, that "All
things come to him who waits." It's
been a long, hard season, and we're
still waiting for sense.
So saying, may we wish you all a
very pleasant plum pudding. May
the best man find the chimney first
—And hope this isn't the end of a
beautiful friendship. Ave, vale, au
revoir, alhambra, phoenix, kansas
i city, and all points East ....
