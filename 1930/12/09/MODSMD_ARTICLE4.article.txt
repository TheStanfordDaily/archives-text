# LINDSEY DEFIES BISHOP; MAY SUE
## Norris Raps Companionate Marriage Crusader 
### 
NEW WORK, Dec. 8. (/P)â€”Former
Judge Ben B. Lindsey of Denver
will tell a court next Friday that he
felt he had just provocation for in
terrupting Bishop William T. Man
ning during the ascription prayer at
the Cathedral of St. John the Di
vine, yesterday.
j Concurrent with this decision,
Lindsey today hinted strongly that
he intended filing a slander suit
against Bishop Manning, and that
in the event that this course was
decided upon he would retain At
' torncy Samuel Untermyer.
Pleads Not Guilty
Arraigned today on a summons
charging disorderly conduct, the
companionate marriage crusader
pleaded not guilty.
Arthur Garfield Hays, attorney
for the former judge, said he would
raise the question that a man with
sufficient provocation has the right
to speak out in church and would
subpoena Bishop Manning to show
there was sufficient provocation in
Ihe Bishops attack on Eindsey's
character, contained in his sermon.
