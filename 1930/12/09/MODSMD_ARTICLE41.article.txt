A study just completed at the 1
University of Washington reveals j
that intelligent men tend to marry
intellectual women and dumb men
usually marry dumb women.
Hut Bernard Shaw claims that
smart men mate with dumb wo
men. The conclusion being
drawn one might suppose that
clever women become "bachelor
girls."
The majority of Stanford women j
marry Stanford men. Now any num- I
ber of deductions can be made from ;
that fact. |
When finals roll along, the stu- ,
dent's mind turns to vague abstrac
tions. The edftor at Occidental Col- \
lege asks: "What is life?"
One abstraction deserves another.
Life is a continuous process where ,
one half of the population repeats
"Three Little Words" to the other '
half—to the intense satisfaction of
both groups.
The University of Manitoba
publishes an article entitled
"Clara Bow, Lux Soap, and
Poets." One cannot see the con- j
nection between these three
subjects unless a!! three are of
ten "all wet."
Yale debaters bowed to Vassar at
tacking the idea that the government i
of the U.S. would be better if women
were in control of it.
Until women can learn to be
trailed by Senate Investigating
Committees without becoming
peeved, they will never control
any more of this government of
women, by women, and for wo- j
men than they now do.
The University of Kansas Daily
Kansan claims that modern youth is j
taking for its aims the high white ;
star of truth. It is no doubt that
many collegians begin "life" with a
passion for the truth but it is like
wise true that before they have gone
far, they tend to become very much
like the "older generation."
The campus C'asanovas be-'
come calm family men; and the
athicsts become loyal church
men. The readers of the Ameri
can Mercury switch to the New I
York Times and thus the world
goes on.
