## SHE WAS A SYMPATHETIC FRIEND 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
So quietly did Nellie Morrison of
Stanford University pass out of mor
tal ken two weeks ago that many ,
who knew her are still unaware of
her death, after a brief illness.
The Stanford Mothers Club, of i
which Mrs. Morrison was a devoted
member for several years, has ex
pressed its appreciation of the fine
work done by her in conducting the
first Rest Home for boys on the |
campus and for her sympathetic
service to Stanford boys during '
their convalescent periods.
To many of the boys who passed
through Mrs. Morrison's home her i
loss is irreparable; enduring friend
ships were formed between her and
them. Her house to these boys was
always a cheerful dropping-in place
where they knew they were sure •

to find a warm welcome and an
ever-sympathetic friend.
Her passing is deeply mourned by
a wide circle of friends of all ages.
Of her it truly can be said that she
had a genius for friendship, par
ticularly with boys. Her friendship
once given, her loyalty was un
swerving. No one will ever know
the extent of her private charities.
To her helping a boy or girl over
a tight place was all in the day's
work.
She was like her favorite flower,
the violet, whose presence is known
to the world by the fragrance steal
ing through the leaves under which
it hides. The fragrance of Mrs. Mor
rison's multiudinous good deeds
will never die.
It is a privilege to inscribe this
little tribute to her.
