# ENRICHING INFLUENCES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Those who heard the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra last spring
were impressed by the high stand
ards that the orchestra had set for
itself. Not only was the playing as
tonishingly good, but also the num
bers selected were both important
and delightful.
It was not a surprise, therefore, to
hear that so memorable a thing as
Beethoven's First Symphony was in
rehearsal for the next concert. Now

we learn that we are to hear, in
addition, Bach's Double Concerto, 1
with Miss Peirce and Mr. Bugge as
soloists, Ruy Bias, by Mendelssohn,
and Schubert's Marche Militaire.
It is a happy thing for Stanford
that Dan Bryant and his augmented
orchestra are bringing to us music
I of this character. Such concerts en-
I rich notably our community life,
and we shall go on Wednesday < ve-*
ning in high anticipation of many
sided pleasures.
