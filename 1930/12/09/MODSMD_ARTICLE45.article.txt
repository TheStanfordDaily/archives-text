# FLYING, NOT GLIDING
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Some confusion has arisen because !
of a notice recently appearing in the j
Daily regarding the proposed pur
chase of a glider by the Palo Alto
Gliding Club, the heading of the
notice reading "Flying Club Buys
Glider," or something of the kind.
In order to erase the impression (
that the Stanford Flying Club is en
gaged in gliding, we would appre
ciate very much your publishing a j
paragraph in your next issue, along > !
the following lines:
The Stanford Flying Club, an or- j
ganization recently formed on the
campus by a group of Stanford men
and women for the purpose of com
bining flight training with economy, 1
wishes to make it clearly understood |
that the Stanford Flying Club has
no connection whatever with the j
Palo Alto Gliding Club, or any
other club engaged in that type of !
aeronautical activity known as glid- j
ing.
Mrs. Phyllis M. Goddard. j
