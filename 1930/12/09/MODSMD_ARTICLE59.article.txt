## 
### 
| MOSCOW, Dec. 8. Five
prominent engineers who at mid
! night heard a fateful verdict of four
| supreme court judges decree they
i must die for plotting intervention in
Soviet Russia, were made joyous to
day by a commutation of their sen
tences to ten years' imprisonment.
Three others, condemned to ten
I years' imprisonment by the verdict
i after a great public trial that had
| lasted since November 25, were
given commutation to eight years'
imprisonment. All are deprived of
. citizenship rights for five years and
; their property will be confiscated.
The" men whose lives were saved
were Leonid Ramsin, leader of the
! conspirators; Alexander Fedotov,
i oldest of the group, who had begged
j piteously for mercy throughout the

hearing; Victor Larichev, first as- |
sislant to Ramsin; Nicolai Charnov- j
sky, and Ivan Kalinikov.
Those whose imprisonment was
reduced from 10 years to eight, were !
Vladimir Ochkin, 30 years old, and
youngest of the band; Sergei Kupri
anov, and Zenophon Sitnin.
The commutation was decided by j
the central executive committee of i
the Union of Socialist Soviet Repub- '
lies, which declared that since the
defendants had confessed and re- |
pentud the Soviet power could not j
be guided by a mere desire for re- i
vengo.
All the defendants confessed and j
confessed fully. They took the view j
that they deserved no mercy be- |
cause of their crimes but would like
a chance to undo their evil deeds !
nevertheless.
