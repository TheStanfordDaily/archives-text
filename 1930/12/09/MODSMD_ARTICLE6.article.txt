## 
### 
. Bernard Pollard, superbly char
acterizing a drunken clerk in "Au
gustus Does His Bit," featured the
program of four one-act plays pre
sented last night in the Little Thea
tre by the dramatic production
classes. In his slapstick wartime sa
tire by Bernard Shaw, directed by
Henry Sloss,* Pollard was ably sup
ported by Norris Rcbholtz and Bar
bara Collins.
Louise Jahant made a creditable
debut in the role of the tearful Ma
Fishyr in Ehrlet's tragedy, "The
Undercurrent." Karl Karnopp di
rected the play.
Ruth Bcede and Henry Cross were
charming in "The Constant Lover"
by Hankin, directed by Gladys Cro
foot. The set was extremely colorful.
Portraying great intensity of fecl
ing, Harold David took the part of
Stephan, the choleric father, in "The
Mistress, 'a tragedy by Gnesin. Val
lejo Gantner showed dramatic pos
sibilities in the direction of this play.
