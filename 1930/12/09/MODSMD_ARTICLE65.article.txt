## Coast Committee To Codify International Piracy Statutes

The Stanford representatives are
Professors Joseph W. Bingham and
Stanley Morrison of the School of
Law, Professors Graham Stuart and
Harold H. Sprout of the Department
of Political Science, and Judge

litical science.
The body is one of a number of
committees in different parts of the
country which are meeting to draft
model conventions on the various
phases of International L-aw. The
Pacific Coast committee is working
on codifying the laws of piracy. Uni
versity professors, practicing law
yers, and a few statesmen make up
the personnel of the committees.

money to the Harvard Law School.

and will attend the meeting here.
