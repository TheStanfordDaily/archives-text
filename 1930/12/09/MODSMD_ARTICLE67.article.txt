# SIDELINE SLANTS
## A 						LAST SPLURGE 
### 
Since this is the last Slants for
1930—shed a tear for the old year,
folks, it wasn't so bad—we have a
few chores to perform. We shall
pick a coach for California's football
team, (ho winner of the Pasadena
liows Bowl Classic, our All-Un
americnn eleven, and other things.
To open the old column, we shall
pick Dick lianlcy of Northwestern
to pilot the Bears through Santa
Clara, Saint Mary's, Washington
State, and U.S.C. on five successive
week-ends. Nice job. Spears is out
because his contract is too binding
(no pun intended); Ilollingbery has
uo A.15. and that lets him out; so
we pick lianlcy.
As for the Flower clash in Pasa
dena we would like to see Wash
ington State win, but we fear that
it will be Alabama's day. Wallace's
boys to Wade through Hollingbery's
crew, even though there's a Bailey
in the offing. Which proves that it
isn't the heat, it's the humidity
which gets the Northern teams in
Pasadena.
Since the AP, the UP, the Con
solidated Press, and practically
everyone else is picking an /VII-
American football team, the Daily
will just fall in line and pick a na
tional group, too. On'v the Daily,
leaving no stone unturned in its
search for truth, presents its All-
Unamerican eleven.
Tickle your tonsils on these:
Ends: Eleewicz of Fordham and
Gantenbein of Wisconsin; tackles,
Lubratovich of Wisconsin and Ahls
kog of Washington State; guards:
Mctzger of Notre Dame and Wis
newski of Fordham; center: Yar,
Notre Dame; quarterback: Carideo
of Notre Dame: halfbacks: Gutow
ski of Oklahoma and Piculiwiecz of
Fordham; fullback: Maculuso of
Colgate.
Think of the d vsperalion such an
out/it would strike into the hearts
of the opposition! [low could anyone
pronounce those names, let alone
stop their owners? What a pleasure
it would be for radio announcers,
sports writers, and public address
systems to follow these men in their
games!
And that lit leaves off numerous
fine young men Hokuf of Nebraska,
Olsen of Pennsylvania, McGrory of
Color, do College, O'Connell of Holy
Cross, Christiansen of Utah, Zim
merman of Tulane, Saumer of St.
Olaf's, Risk of Purdue, Scalzi of
Georgetown, and Viviano of Cor
nell.
To go on with this, we could pick
a team composed of Conley and
Terry, ends: MacKesey and Foley at
tackles; Beckett and Linchan,
guards: Morrison, center; Graney,
quarterback; .'<:u phy and Donovan,
halves: and Crowley, fullback. Think
el the liarmom that ball club could
get singing "Ireland Must Be
Heaven, for Me Mither Came From
There!''
/
Yes, sir, it's a great American
game. No wonder they call it the
Melting Pot! With the Fighting Irish,
Ihe Gaels and the Gauls, and the
Terrible Swedes all mixing things
up on the gridiron, affairs get into
a stew. (Not counting the fans who
are also pretty pickled as well.)
We'!, as we started out to say
about ten paragraphs hack, Merry
Christmas to all, and a Ilappy New
Year as well. Since we are getting
around to that time of year, it also
might not he a bad idea for the
sons and daughters of the Stanford
Red to be good children over vaca
tion. and perhaps Santa Claus or
John Bunn will present all the little
undergraduates with a winning bas
ketball team for a change.
Readers of this column may re
call the author mentioning that after
the U.S.C. game, Sid Ziff of the Los
Angeles Express took the liberty of
reprinting Sideline Slants in totum
wherein we had picked Stanford to
defeat the Trojans. Since sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander,
we reprint the following from Mr.
Ziff's blurb prior to the Notre Dame-
Southern California agony:
Sez ZilY: "The loss of Mullins is a
a knockout blow for the Irish . . .
Notre Dame will have to face U.S.C.
with a third-string fullback . . .
hov. can he hope to fathom an at
tack that has fooled some of the best
defensive backs in the country? . . .
There are other reasons why S.C.
should be an immense favorite . . .
Musick will have il all over Ilanley
as a fullback, and probably over
Mullins, too, if be should play . . .
Mctzger will be in for a hot after
noon . . . remember what the Tro
jans did to Pittsburgh?"
We will mail a copy of this col
limn, along with the one printed in
Friday's Daily, down to the afore
mentioned sports editor. We only
hope that the slogan: "Ziff—and it's
wrong'' will not be adopted in the
sunny South. —L. K., Jr.
