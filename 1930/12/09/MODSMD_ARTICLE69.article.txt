# Delta Upsilon Leads In Intramural Sports Pac[illigible]
## THETA CHI TRAILS LEADERS IN RACE FOR CHAMPIONSHIP Delts, Breakers, May Take Lead From D.U.'s With Strong Teams 
### Michael Crofoot 
Delta Upsilon is leading the race
for this year's intramural sports
, championship with 62.5 points and
Theta Chi is second with 59, ac
cording to an unofficial check-up
made last night by Parker Reed, di
rector of intramural athletics.
Since championships in golf,
handball, and cross country have
been completed, since touch football
is virtually over, and only the track
and gymnastic meets remain to be
I settled, this check-up is a rough in
dication of what the team standing
will be at the end of the quarter.
Delta Tau Delta, with teams com
peting in the three undecided cham
pionships, has a chance of taking
the lead from the D.U.'s, however,
and Breakers, the favorite for the
track meet, should improve its posi
tion.
In third place in the present
standings is the old reliable, El Toro,
with 50 points. Next in lin-? are four
teams, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma
Nu, Delta Tau Delta, and Sigma Chi,
each with 45 points.
Victories in handball and golf
have placed the D.U.'s in their ex
alted position. A league-winning
touch football team and a golfing
duo that reached the semi-finals are
the factors in Theta Chi's place. El
'Toro is up among the leaders by
virtue of a posthumous win in cross
country and a second-place football
team.
It is a significant fact that by
merely entering a team in each of
the championships, a group could
have scored 25 points; yet not a
single organization- did this.
Unofficial standings of the leading
teams follow:
Delta Upsilon 62 l / 2
Theta Chi 59
El Toro 50
Sigma Alpha Epsilon 45
1 Sigma Nu 45
Sigma Chi 45
Delta Tau Delta 45
Breakers 41 Vz
Alpha Kappa Lambda 40
Delta Chi 40
