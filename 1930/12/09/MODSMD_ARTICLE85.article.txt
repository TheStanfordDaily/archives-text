# Mural Tracksters Run Qualifying Heats Tomorrow
## FINALS OF ANNUAL MEET TO BE RUN FRIDAY AFTERNOON Breakers Slightly Favored To Defeat El Toro For Title 
### 
Competition of the annual intra
mural track and field meet com
mences tomorrow at 4 o'clock, when
trials in 12 events get under way at
the varsity cinder oval. Finals are
to be held Friday afternoon at 4
o'clock.
Fourteen organizations, including
El Toro, defending champion, will he
contending for the team champion
ship with its corallaries of a silver
plaque and points toward Ihe intra
mural title. Striving for the indi
vidual championships with their
awai'ds of gold, silver, and bronze
medals will be the members of these
teams as well as 158 independent
entrants.
Breakers Favored
Breakers, runner-up in last year's
meet, is perhaps the strongest of
the group entries and appears likely
to dethrone El Toro. Chief luminary
of their team is Les Hables, one of
the two best sprinters in school, who
will be defending his three indi
vidual titles, won in the 100,- 220,-
and 440-yard races last year. He
holds the records in these three
races with times of 10 seconds, 22 1-5
seconds, and 49 4-5 seconds, respec
tively. Eligibility troubles have pre
vented him from capitalizing his
great abilities to win a track letter;
so he is still a bona fide competitor
for the intramural meet.
Azevedo, freshman distance star,
and winner of the recent intramural
cross-country race, is another mem
ber of their team who is sure to
break into the scoring column.
Wright Is Toro Slar
Most of El Toro's championship
team graduated last spring, but they
have Dick Wright, the holder of (he
intramural mile record of 4:38,
among the other potential point
scorers.
Frank Young, former Washington
State College track star, who has
run the half-mile in 1:55, will be
representing Theta Chi.
Independent runners should carry
home a goodly number of the indi
vidual medals, for Paul Aebersold
and Jimmy Willson are unaffiliated.
The former is a transfer from Pasa
dena Junior College, where he ne
gotiated the two miles in 10 min
utes upon one occasion. Competing
unofficially in this year's cross
country race because of a techni
cality, he crossed the finish line
second.
Willson, best of the freshman
sprinters and possessor of a brilliant
high-school record, should share in
the 100-yard prize distribution.
