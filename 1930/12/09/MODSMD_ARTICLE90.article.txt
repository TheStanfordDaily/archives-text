# Pugilist Equalled Tunney's Social Rise 80 Years Ago, Was Congressman and Race Track Promoter

Gene Tunney wasn't the first prize '
i fighter in this country to bust into
society. Far from it. Mr. John Mor
j rissey, who held the American
I heavyweight title almost eighty
| years ago, was elected to the Legis
i lature from the silk-stocking district
of New York City. He "shook his
' mop of black hair in warm debate
j for two terms in Congress" and
j crashed society with the greatest of
; ease.
j One of the most famous bare
knuckle prize fights in history was
| between Tom Sayers, that gallant
| Englishman, and John Camel Heen
an, "the Benicia Boy." They met for
200 pounds a side and the champion
ship of the world, and fought thirty
i five rounds in two hours and six
i minutes on April 17, 1860.
Two Champions
It was a draw never fought off,
! and the English patrons of the sport
, recognized Heenan and Sayers as
1 joint holders of the world's title,
j and presented each with the cham
' pion's bell. Sayers, however, went i

1 into retirement immediately after
the fight, and Heenan reigned as
thirty-ninth champion oft the world
and the first American-born fighter
to hold the title until he was beaten
by Tom King in 1863.
Our hero, Morrissey, who looks
very much like Trade or Mark—the
famous Smith brothers—beat Heen
an in 1852 (maybe softened him up
for Sayers?) and claimed the Ameri
can heavyweight championship.
John Morrissey was known for other
things besides his ability with his
knuckles and his two terms in the
Legislature.
Built Ilaec Track
He was the first big gambler at
Saratoga and built the present race
track there, which another fighter,
Billy Myers, made the fastest in the
world. Morrissey built the club
house at Saratoga in 1869, for gam
bling purposes, and never allowed
a woman in it. His successor, Can
field, also kept women out, even re
fusing an offer of $100,000 once in
i order to maintain Morrissey's rule!
