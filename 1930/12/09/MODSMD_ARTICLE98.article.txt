# ROSE BOWL GAME TO DECIDE TEAM SECOND TO IRISH
## Washington State-Alabama Contest Concludes Pigskin Season 
### 
Washington State's undefeated
Cougars vs. Alabama's Crimson-clad
warriors in the Rose Bowl at Pasa
dena on January 1, 1931. Marking
at the same time the conclusion of
one year's gridiron activities and the
opening of another season's football
frays, the New Year's Day game will
decide the runner-up to Notre Dame
and her team of national champions.
Such is the dessert in store for pig
skin fans after the heavy fare of
the 1930 menu.
For a variety of reasons, the men
from the South rate an edge. Ac
customed to a warm climate, meet
ing their tough teams late in the
season instead of during the open
ing weeks of the campaign, Wallace
Wade's warriors will be right for the
final battle. Not so the men of Hol
lingbery.
Out of their element beneath the
broiling sun of the Southland, sof
tened by the final weeks of warfare
against Idaho, Washington, and Vil
lanova —none of these being truly
dangerous opponents—it will be a
bitter battle for the Cougars to re
gain the stride which took them past
the Trojans.
With Notre Dame already elected
king of football during the season
of 1930, it will remain for the win
ner of the Rose Bowl classic to de
cide second place in the national
standings. Unbeaten in the regions
south of the Mason and Dixon line,
Alabama matches the spotless shield
of the men of Hollingbery. The field
of combat will prove how the men
match up, and the outcome of the
battle should show less of a shock
than that following the Troy-South
Bend episode.
