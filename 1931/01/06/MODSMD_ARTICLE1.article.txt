# CIRCUIT COURT HOLDS LEGALITY OF PROHIBITION
## Thibault Conviction Based On Ruling Passed By Supreme Court METHOD IS APPRAISED 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 5. (/P) â€” The
Eighteenth Amendment was held to
have been legally adopted in a de
cision today by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals. The de
fense in the case was the same as in
the Sprague case in New Jersey in
which Federal Judge Clark held that
the amendment had not been legally
ratified.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the
conviction of Louis E. Thibault of
Windsor, Vermont, who was accused
of possessing and selling two pints
of whiskey.
As in the Sprague case, counsel
for the losing side anounced today
that the appeal would be taken to
the United States Supreme Court.
>. Violation of Rights
In each case counsel defending
the accused person contended Ihat
after adoption, of the 10th Amend
ment, no amendment giving the na
tional government additional powers
over the people or over their rights
could be adopted except by the peo
ple in combination or. by their dele
gated representatives.
The 18th Amendement, they con
tended, was not legally ratified by
the states because it was approved
by the legislatures instead of state
conventions gathered for the express
purpose of considering it.
Judge Clark supported and elab
orated upon this contention in the
New Jersey Federal Court and freed
William Sprague, the defendant, on
the ground that the prohibition
amendment had not been legally
adopted.
Former Decision
The Court of Appeals declared to
day that the Supreme Court already
had held the 18th Amendment to
have been proposed and ratified
lawfully. The amendment, it ruled,
"had become a part of the Constitu
tion and must be respected and
must be given effect the same as
other provisions of that instrument."
"There has been a long acqui
escence and approval of the method
of proposing and ratifying amend
ments as followed in the case of the
J St h Amendment," the decision said.
"The Constitution was adopted in
1789. The first ten amendments were
aciopted in 1791. All, even the first
ten amendments, were-proposed and
ratified in line manner to the 18th.
"If it is the will of the people to
change by amendment the Constitu
tion, the method in article five was
effective even after passage on the
10th Amendment. The Supreme
Court cases referred to are authori
tative and binding upon us. It fol
lows that the defense interposed of
unlawful ratification of (he 18lh
Amendment is without merit."
