# SWART REPORTS SOCIAL SCIENCE FIELDS GOOD IN U. OF HAWAII
## 
### BEATRICE BISHOP 
"I really found the University of
Hawaii a far superior organization
to what I had anticipated," said Pro
fessor Graham Stuart of the Depart
ment of Political Science, who has
just returned from the Hawaiian Is
lands where he conducted courses
in international relations in the uni
versity and also delivered lectures
on the same subject. "It is particu
larly good in the fields of sociology,
political science, and race relations,
and has very excellent library fa
cilities." .
Although the students in the uni
versity are predominantly orientals,
Professor Stuart was surprised to
find lhat the audiences for his lec
tures were composed mostly of
whites. "Everywhere I found audi
ences that were intelligent. They
were very anxious to discuss." Ac

cording to Professor Stuart, one of I
the greatest handicaps in the islands I
is lack of good news service, so his j
lectures were well attended by peo- |
pie eager to learn all they could.
Professor Stuart found the radio j
used quite extensively by the uni
versity, which would put on a short
program three or four times a week,
sometimes giving a course covering
several evenings, at other times giv
ing special lectures or music, and
information about the university.
"A thing that I think ought to be
mentioned." Professor Stuart con- j
tinued, "is that owing to very re
markable co-operation they have
abolished bill - boards completely
throughout the islands. This has
been done entirely through co-op
eration."
Professor Stuart made his trips
from island to island by airplane.
