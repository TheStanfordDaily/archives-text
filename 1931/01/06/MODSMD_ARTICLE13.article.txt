situation. For the first time in the
history of Stanford sororities, one of

regular rushing period, due to the
ruling of Pan-Hellenic as penalty
for the alleged illegal bidding on the
part of Kappa Alpha Theta.
The first, or preliminary, period
of rushing is to consist of four days,
from January 10 to 13. Two days

called silence period, and the final
period will be from the 16th to the
21st.
Instead of the five days of last
year's final rushing period there will
be six days, since it was considered
more advantageous to have the
longer time which had been cus
tomary in previous years. The other
Pan-Hellenic regulations concern
ing rushing remain unchanged.
