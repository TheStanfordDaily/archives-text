# MASSES AT BIER OF JOFFRE PAY HOMAGE TO 'PARIS DEFENDER'
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 5. (/P)â€”Marshal Jo
seph Jacques Joffre, the "Defender
of Paris" as he will go down in his
tory, lay in state today to receive an
homage from the people of France
th.at has rarely, perhaps never, been
surpassed in his country's annals.
All knew beforehand that magnifi
cent manifestations of respect would
be paid beside the bier of the man
who was almost an idol of the
French masses, but the number of
Frenchmen and French women who
poured from their homes today to
honor him exceeded all forecasts.
The crowd began to take form at
dawn and slowly as the day ad
vanced it grew until just before
nightfall it became a vast multitude
which at one moment got out of
bounds and women were knocked
down and trampled upon before
order was restored.
The stream of those who filed
through the portals of France's fam
ous military school to pause for a
moment beside the body of the old
warrior grew 20 deep and stretched
from the entrance of the school
nearly a quarter of a mile away
across the Champ de Mars.
There were many thousands of
ihem and one of the most touching
tributes was that of the hundreds of
children who joined in the solemn
march. It was a dreary \vait but the
Marshal's countrymen stood patient
ly with little to say.
