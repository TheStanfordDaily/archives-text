# FRESHMAN CAGERS DOWNED BY UKIAH OUTFIT 20 TO 18
## 
### 
i? auurc to locate the hoop on
cripple shots cost the Cardinal
freshman cage team its first defeat
of the season, 20 to 18, last night to
an aggressive sharp shooting squad
from Ukiah High School. In mak
ing their debut to campus fans,
Coach Bunn's yearlings failed to
show the stout defense exhibited in
their two games during the vacation,
allowing the high school men to
break through for numerous set-ups,
a large majority of which were made
good.
The farm youngsters, on the other
hand, gathered in most of their 18
points on long shots. While their
floorwork was superior to that of the
visiting team, they repeatedly failed
after working the ball down the
floor in brilliant fashion.
The game was a see-saw affair
throughout, with never more than
three points separating the two
teams. Half time found the visitors
leading 5 to 4, and the battle waged
on even terms till late in the fourth
period when Cancio of the visitors
sunk one to put his team in the lead,
15 to 14. Ukiah drew away from
the Cardinal outfit steadily till the
hist minute of play, when the score
stood at 20 to 16.
Massey's brilliant single-handed
score just before the gong left Ukiah
with their two-point victory.
Panero and Massey of the Stan
ford babes with eight points each
tied for high point honors with Can
cio of Ukiah. Balzarini of the visi
tors trailed the leaders with seven
counters.
