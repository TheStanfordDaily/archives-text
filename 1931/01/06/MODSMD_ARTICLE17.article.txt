## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 5. (/P)â€”ln an
early morning haze that hung over
the entrance to New York harbor,
the United States Army dredge
Raritan was sunk today by the
Savannah line/ City of Montgomery.
The army boat went down in eleven
minutes, but Ihe fifty-seven officers
and men aboard were saved.
The loss of the Raritan was esti
mated at $191,000 but army officials
said she would cost $1,000,000 to re
place. The liner's bow was deeply
dented at the water line, but she
was able to make her pier unas
sisted.
Captain John Peterson, com
mander of the dredge, was slightly
injured.
The fact that no lives were lost
probably was due to the timely
warning given by Samuel F. Watts,
of Southport, N.C., third mate of
the Raritan. He was on the bridge
and when he saw a collision was in
evitable, he ordered the boats
manned.
