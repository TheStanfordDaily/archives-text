# SENATE FAVORS DROUGHT RELIEF
## House Frowns On Extra $15,000,000 Measure 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5. (/P> —
Holiday silence in the capitol today
gave way to the familiar turmoil of
a busy session with drought relief
discussion reverberating loudest and
longest.
The senate added $15,000,000 to the
$45,000,000 agreed upon for relief
with the express provision that the
extra money be used to buy food
for hungry people. The action might
have been an echo of the shouts of
farmers in the little town of Eng
land, Arkansas, who shouted Satur
day for "food for starving families."
Administration supporters in the
house frowned when the $45,000,000
came back to the senate leading the
additional $15,000,000 by the hand.
They plan to send the addition to
the legislative morgue if possible.
In comparison with the other side
of the capitol, however, the house
had an uneventful day. It began
work in a businesslike manner on
the $440,024,000 War Department
supply bill and a $92,383,000 defi
ciency bill with the idea of passing
them before the week is over.
