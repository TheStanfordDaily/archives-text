# DR. BENJAMIN EXPLAINS CHICAGO'S NEW COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN
## 
### RONALD ROGERS 
"The University of Chicago's plan
of granting degrees to students when
they know enough to pass a com
prehensive examination is a credit
able experiment which is long over
due in higher education, in the
opinion of many educators and stu
dents."
That is the way Dr. Harold Ben
jamin of the Stanford )'iSucation
school sums up the scheme proposed
by Chicago's 31-year-old president.
Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, and
approved by the trustees and fac
ulty of that institution.
"Instead of being advanced by
hours, credits, and grades, as under
the traditional system, and being
held down to the pace of his flower
fellows, the capable student will be

[ encouraged to explore for himself
| and add to his learning when and
what he will, His knowledge will
j then be of subjects rather than
I courses," Dr. Benjamin stated.
"A difficulty with the system is
| that it is almost impossible to gauge
j a student's fitness to take a compre
| hensive examination except by
I grades and credits, which would be
; a partial return to the established
I order.
j "Certification of students who
i merely pass four years of courses is
'■ advisable because of the growing
, realization that many come to col
i lege merely for social prestige or a
good time. Degree holders, on the
other hand, may propvess to ad
vnnced and profi ssional work."
