# INDIANS CHECK GRIZZLY RALLY TO WIN, 34-33
## Reynolds Stars For Cards As Montana Captain Leads Field VISITORS LEAD AT HALF 
### Len Kullmann 
Staving off a desperate closing
rally staged by the Montana live,
Stanford's basketball quintet took a
close contest from the invaders last
night by a score of 34 Led by
Captain Rohlffs, who fought like a
wild man in the closing moments,
Montana was extremely dangerous
at all times.
The result of the game remained
in doubt for several minutes after
Ihe final gong, for in a mad scram
ble for the ball as the game ended,
"Bud" Hawkins fouled Captain
Rohlffs. The officials ruled that the
offense had been committed after the
contest ended, however, and victory
went to the Cardinals.
Cardinals Trail at Half
Trailing at half time with the
score 17-15. Bunn's boys came back
to take the lead on a basket by Rin
tala and a tip shot by Captain Rey
nolds. Rohlffs kept his men in the
ball game by repeated field goals
and walked off with high-point
honors with 14 digits, but Stanford
gradually forged into the lead.
Baskets by Doub, Baker, and Rin
tala gave the Cardinal cohorts a
34-29 lead as finish time approached,
and the Indians attempted to stall.
The injection of Carey into the
lineup at this juncture nearly proved
disastrous to the Stanford cause, for
this young man shot two field goals
to make the contest a hectic one as
the clock crept toward the final
marker.
Lead Alternating
Unsually speedy, the game saw a
seemingly endless procession of
shoes carving the center of the bas
ket. The lead alternated during the
first half, Stanford drawing first
blood on a field goal by Fawcett, but
the early lead withered before the
Grizzlies' rush.
Captain Rohlffs of Montana was
easily the outstanding man on the
floor, and was the spark plug of the
Grizzlies' offense. Captain Mike Rey
nolds of Stanford was second to the
rival skipper for high-point honors,
the Cardinal leader scoring eight
points on four field goals.
Fawcett, MolTatt Star
Vance Fawcett, who was forced
from the game after four personal
fouls, and Phil Moffatt also starred
for the Redshirts. Rudy Rintala,
playing the full game for the third
consecutive clash, experienced a lit
tle difficulty in caging his shots
during the first half, but bagged a
brace of "field goals for himself be
fore the game ended.
Bill Doub, Phil Baker, and Payne
Palmer, while not in for the 'eater
part of the session, demoi. ialed
that Bunn possesses reserve strength
on the squad, "Bud " Hawkins, con -
tributing a foul try, bolstered the
Cardinal defense during the second
half.

Staving off a desperate closing
rally staged by the Montana live,
Stanford's basketball quintet took a
close contest from the invaders last
night by a score of 34 Led by
Captain Rohlffs, who fought like a
wild man in the closing moments,
Montana was extremely dangerous
at all times.
The result of the game remained
in doubt for several minutes after
Ihe final gong, for in a mad scram
ble for the ball as the game ended,
"Bud" Hawkins fouled Captain
Rohlffs. The officials ruled that the
offense had been committed after the
contest ended, however, and victory
went to the Cardinals.
Cardinals Trail at Half
Trailing at half time with the
score 17-15. Bunn's boys came back
to take the lead on a basket by Rin
tala and a tip shot by Captain Rey
nolds. Rohlffs kept his men in the
ball game by repeated field goals
and walked off with high-point
honors with 14 digits, but Stanford
gradually forged into the lead.
Baskets by Doub, Baker, and Rin
tala gave the Cardinal cohorts a
34-29 lead as finish time approached,
and the Indians attempted to stall.
The injection of Carey into the
lineup at this juncture nearly proved
disastrous to the Stanford cause, for
this young man shot two field goals
to make the contest a hectic one as
the clock crept toward the final
marker.
Lead Alternating
Unsually speedy, the game saw a
seemingly endless procession of
shoes carving the center of the bas
ket. The lead alternated during the
first half, Stanford drawing first
blood on a field goal by Fawcett, but
the early lead withered before the
Grizzlies' rush.
Captain Rohlffs of Montana was
easily the outstanding man on the
floor, and was the spark plug of the
Grizzlies' offense. Captain Mike Rey
nolds of Stanford was second to the
rival skipper for high-point honors,
the Cardinal leader scoring eight
points on four field goals.
Fawcett, MolTatt Star
Vance Fawcett, who was forced
from the game after four personal
fouls, and Phil Moffatt also starred
for the Redshirts. Rudy Rintala,
playing the full game for the third
consecutive clash, experienced a lit
tle difficulty in caging his shots
during the first half, but bagged a
brace of "field goals for himself be
fore the game ended.
Bill Doub, Phil Baker, and Payne
Palmer, while not in for the 'eater
part of the session, demoi. ialed
that Bunn possesses reserve strength
on the squad, "Bud " Hawkins, con -
tributing a foul try, bolstered the
Cardinal defense during the second
half.
