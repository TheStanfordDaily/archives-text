nil. i;i:st plays or ii)2»-ia:io,
edited by Darns Mantle. Dodd,
Mead at tin; Palo Alto Book Shop).
Mr. Mantle's annual best seller
appears quilc on time. Invaluable as
a record of the year on Broadway,
it is discouragingly devoid of any
: criticism save, perhaps, record of
number of performances, a type of
I capsule criticism sometimes quite
effective.
Faniasy plays an unusually large
' part in this year's assortment: "Ber
! keley Square," "Death Takes a Holi
day," "The Green Pastures." "The
Criminal Code" and"The Last Mile"
demonstrate something or other;
comedy is amply represented by
"The First Mrs. Fraser" and "Strict
ly Dishonorable."
We should like to have seen "Chil
| dren of Darkness" and "Rope's End,"
even "Topaze" in place of the more
j successful dramas which Mr. Mantle
; seems to demand.

AC "TORS'—AND PKOPL!-:, by Peggy
Wood. I). Appleion (at the Palo
Alto Book Shop).
Miss Peggy Wood, actress, demon
strates that though an actor's first
j ambition is to play Hamlet his next
i is to write a book. This rather clev
erly penned collection of magazine
articles is anything but valuable,
though mildly amusing to one inter
ested in the stage and its person
i alities.
An interview with the scowling
Mr. Shaw, an account of the vaga
ries ol Madame Calve, the familiar
| record of an actor's.day, and the
I struggles of an actress' with Ihe talk
ie:; comprise the unimposing whole.
The book demonstrates that Miss
Wood can write as well as act (she
has been stai red in Noel Coward's
"Bitter Sweet" for over a year). We
wish that she would expend her wit
ticisms on something more—er, shall
we say, vital? Her appreciation ol

| John Drew, "the splendid gypsy," i
>is an example of whal she can do. !

THE WIDOW I ROM CHICAGO—
At the Varsity Theatre.
While still another story of the
' underworld which of course in
cludes gun-fights, big crooks and
' their molls, and bootleg liquor, "The
Widow From Chicago" is by no
means stale. It is. fast-moving, ex
citing, iiiid holds one's interest from 1
I beginning to end.
Alice White, the widow, lands in I
j New York, out to get the man who j
killed her brother. Having' accom
! plished this feat, she reforms the
handsome young gunman arid mar- I
! ries him. It's been done before, but ;
! such a plot will always entertain as
long as there are new angles and
i pretty widows.
Neil Hamilton does well as the
I handsome gunman, bul the honors
of the show go to the villain, Dom
inick, who handles ;i difficult role
| excellently. —N. J.
SIN TAKES A HOLIDAY at the!
Stanford Theater.
As usual, the title is misleading,
j but in spite of i< "Sin Takes a Holi
| day'' is an excellent picture. Con- i
j stance Bennett stars, and gives a
finished performance. Supporting
Miss Bennett are two able actors,
| Kenneth MacKenna and Basil Rath
bone.
; Miss Bennett is very lovely as the
secretary who marries her employer
iri order to save him from another
woman. She spends her honeymoon '
in Paris, alone. From that time on.
things start to happen.
The plot is original enough to I
; stand alone. Consequently with the :
aid of a highly entertaining dia
logue and magnificent clothes and
sets "Sin Takes a Holiday' 'i:; cer
tain of success.
