Mr. Mantle's annual best seller
appears quilc on time. Invaluable as
a record of the year on Broadway,
it is discouragingly devoid of any
: criticism save, perhaps, record of
number of performances, a type of
I capsule criticism sometimes quite
effective.
Faniasy plays an unusually large
' part in this year's assortment: "Ber
! keley Square," "Death Takes a Holi
day," "The Green Pastures." "The
Criminal Code" and"The Last Mile"
demonstrate something or other;
comedy is amply represented by
"The First Mrs. Fraser" and "Strict
ly Dishonorable."
We should like to have seen "Chil
| dren of Darkness" and "Rope's End,"
even "Topaze" in place of the more
j successful dramas which Mr. Mantle

The book demonstrates that Miss
Wood can write as well as act (she
