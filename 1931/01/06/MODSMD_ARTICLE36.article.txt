# Cabbages and Things

### 
Happy Now Year, and may (ho
best alibi win! So far, Cabbages lias
discovered three familiar faces on
campus—three who by some acci
dent escaped the red pencil of the
official University Flunker.
Stanford should adopt the old
"Shall We Meet?" hymn, to be used
as a pass-word when excommuni
cated students meet in the corridor
of some un-particular business
school.

Anyhow, Happy New Year! And
we've the best list of resolutions
for 1930:
We will not take the girl friend
riding on moonlight nights. Sky
line is slippery between Janu
ary and April.
* »!: #
We will not go wading on Lagu
nita (if the rain keeps on). It's
hard on the youngest tadpoles.
# * *
We will not make bad puns,
no matter how strong (lie temp
tation. So, we will not make
puns.
>K «t
We will not swear, unless suffi
ciently provoked. If a room-mate
talks a lot, that's provocation. If he
murmurs to himself, that's sufficient.

i * We will not speak to strange
clogs parked in strange automo
biles, near Quad. Look lor the
man with the fractured fingers.
Strange dogs snap.
Last and least, the public is always
right, until its back is turned. If
you don't like what we do for you,
tell the man who sits next to you in
Psych lecture about it.
Roble Hall is all a-twitter, not to
I say all a-tremble, a-grttmble, a
giggle, and a-gaga.
During vacation, a perfectly seri
ous letter was delivered there, ad
dressed to Mr. Leland Stanford, Jr.,
Roble Hall, Palo Alto.
We've heard about "the perfect
co-ed," but that's carrying things a
little too far.
Between faculty and students and
coaching staff, we've managed to
run up rather a nice lot of cases for
damage suits in the last three weeks.
Which brings us to the college
man who was questioned about
an automobile accident he'd seen
on New Year's 'night. "Were
the other woman's injuries se
rious?" his friend asked. "Well
—two of 'em were fatal, but the
I other one wasn't so bad.'
