College editors from all parts of i
the country return to their desks i
after llu.' Christmas holidays with '
rc newed vigor and fiery dispositions. J
Prominent among those institu- j
lions that have already winced un- j
tier the stinging verbal lash of uni- i
versity journalists are football, |
grades, professors, Santa Claus, tui- j
(ion rates, and co-eds.
As is customary under the condi- j
tions, Ihe editors plead for co-opera- i
lion—the magic catch-word to cure !
all evils.
And sandwiched in between cdi- ■
tonal tirades are Ihe usual calls for (
school spirit and an undying loyalty i
to this or that dear old alma mater.
The President of Stanford's un- j
official auxiliary across the bay, !
T.iills College, claims that college is J
just a training for future duties in j
'•life." !
Even a hurried study of courses
and ext ra-cui ieular activities will
show that college is not a miniature
copy of "life"—all valedictory i
speeches to the contrary.
College is the first and last place j
where the majority even begin to j
dabble in that vague something j
termed culture. Here, as opposed to j
"life," with the financial drive re- j
moved, the student can think and |
talk as he pleases.
H< re for one brief moment, the j
"winds of freedom"' blow for rich
Mid poor radical and conservative
—babbit and sophisticate. When col- ;
leges imitate liie, they will be busi- i
ness college: and not universities of •
higher education.
