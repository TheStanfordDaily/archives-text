# IMPROVEMENTS ON BUILDING WILL AID IN ADMINISTRATION
## 
### 
Commenting on the remodeling of
the offices in the Administration
Building completed during the ;
Christmas holidays, John P. Mitch
ell. registrar, said yesterday that the
new arrangement was made with,
the aim of quick service and conser- I
vation of time.
"Under the present system we
hope to manage the affairs of ad
ministration and take care of stu
dent problems more efficiently,' he
declared.
"Dean Mary Yost now has her of- !
fices in those formerly belonging to
Dean Culver," the registrar stated, j
"while Culver's office has been
moved upstairs to the former ap
pointment service quarters. In the
registrar's department we have com- (
bined our old work with that of the
appointment office because we feel
that the two belong rightfully to
gether. Dean Yost's old office has
been included in ours.
"The registrar's department has
been divided into nine smaller of
fices by means of wooden partitions,"
Mitchell concluded. "Eight of the
offices and their accompanying wait
ing-rooms are new. while one is a
replacement of an old office."
