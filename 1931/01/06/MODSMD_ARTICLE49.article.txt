# "MILKING" OF SNAKES SHOWN TO SCIENTISTS
## 
### 
The process of "milking" snakes
for their venom, which is used in
the production of anti-toxic serum,
was featured in the picture "The
Rattlesnakes of America" which was
shown in the Stanford Assembly
Hall at the opening of the conven
tion of the Pacific division of the
American Association of the Ad
vancement of Science held during
the vacation period.
The picture, prepared by the Cali
fornia Acadcmy of Sciences, pre
sents the red diamond as having the
largest amount of venom, and de
scribes the process by which the
venom is procured by being artifi
cially induced through pressure,
when it is drained and added to the
blood of inoculated horses to pre
pare the scrum.
