My, what an awful, scurvy thing
The world would be if I were king.
To waste my time upon a throne
When I'd much rather be alone
Is hardly whal I'd care to do
(And neither, if you're wise, would
you).
The king (although he lives in state,
With wealth too boundless to relate,
And countless serfs to heed his call),
Since he already owns it all,
Derives no profit from his rule;
And yet, he has to pay the fool.
No doubt you readily can see
How much more happy 1 shall be
If I can stay just as I am,
And have no care, nor give a damn.
Nor do a thing, except at times
