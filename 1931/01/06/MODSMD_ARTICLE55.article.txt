RESUME
While numerous sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red hit the
homeward trail to play havoc with
the turkey crop during the late holi
day seasfon, the Stanford varsity
basketball squad remained on the
Farm to practice for the present
hoop season. Two wins and two
losses summarize the results of the
games- excepting the Montana epic
which we will attend after this has
been written.
In their debut, Bitnn's boys looked
ragged while winning from Hail Jose
State Teachers College, '11-11. Out
in front for the entire game, the
Cardinals seemed unable to master
the intricacies of the "Phog" Allen
system, and the door work was slip
shod.
Stanford stock hit a rise in ihe
second clash. Although losing to the
Y.M.I, five by a score of 2G-20, the
locals showed a world of improve
ment. Frequent Cardinal substitu
tions weakened the outfit, but with
the score 22-11 against them, a clos
ing rally brought the game to a
24-20 crisis with two minutes to
play. A long bucket by the Y.M.f.
gave the invaders a hard-fought en
counter.
"I'm going to Palo AUo and watch
St. M'i. ,y"s play Stanford," said Pat
I'raytjo over the radio last Friday
night, but tli" Call-Bulletin chief
tain saw Stanford play St. Mary's.
B,> the sweet margin of 1.1-24 the
Gaels and Gauls were trounced, and
the half-time score stood 20-7 in
favor of the red-clad hoopsters.
Last Saturday, the University of
San Francisco turned in the second
win of the season at Stanford's ex
pense. Tied 22-22 at the end oi' ihe
regular playing period, an overtime
session found the Fog victorious,
27-24. That, fellow students, was a
real ball :;anv'. Ducket for bucket
they battled, with Needles' five
ahead at the final gong. Win or lose,
that brawl proved Stanford had a
basketlxili team at last.
So passed the holidays. Showing
steady improvement in each game,
the Cardinal cagers have been com
ing along. This yen 's outfit is not a
world heater, hut it is by far the
best hall club we have seen at Stan
ford. Coach Dunn <iid not stop with
the new uniforms—his men are
showing new fire and ability.
Most conspicuous in the makeup
of the quintet is its air-tight defense,
fast-breaking offense, and rear
rangement of men. Vance Fawcett
lias been shifted to guard and Cap
tain Mike Reynolds to center in the
course of th > season, with notice
able effect. Few sucker shots are
allowed by the regulars, and the
men lose no time in .sweeping down
the court, once they secure the oval.
Stanford students owe it to them
selves to follow the Iff.' 1 .! hoopsters—
foi they have an outfit to he proud
of. No one will smear that hunch
badly, we suspect, while the Cardi
nals are going to win quite a few
games themselves, 'thank John Bunn
for the pickup in basketball en
deavor. and watch the hoys improve.
