### Michael Crofoot 
Although Sigma Chi has tenta
tively won the intramural football
championship, a dispute over the
! ligibiiity of a Sigma Chi player has
left the matter unsettled according
to Harry Wolter, director of intra
rnunl athletics.
Wolter plans to hold a conference
between the disputants today to de
termine the eligibility of the player
in question. If the player is de
clared ineligible it is possible that
the game wi!! bo either forfeited or
played over again, Wolter said.
Sigma Chi's touch football team
was thought to be the 1930 intra
mural champion. Meeting Delta Tau
Delta for the title December 9, they
won a 2-0 victory by smothering the
Delt attack throughout the game and
outgaining it in the ten extra plays
which decide a tie.
Delt Attack Held
Pro-game favorites because of
their impressive attack which had
won seven straight game u and scored
121 points, the Delis were not once
able to threaten their opponents'
goal. Clever, aggressive play by
Walker and Reeder, Sigma Chi ends,
halted almost all of the flanking runs
of Twelvetrees and Werder, Delt
backs, while an ;:lert pass defense
knocked down or intercepted most
of their aerial attempts despite the
absence of Joujon-Roche, stellar
Sigma Chi safety man, who was kept
from playing by an injured knee.
The Sigma Chi's were unable to
seriously threaten Delta Tau Delta's
goal line; at the close of the regular
pk.ying time neither team had
scored. Alter the ball had been
placed in the middle of the field,
eacn team alternately tried five
plays.
Costly Penalty
Pushed far back in their territory
by a 15-yard penalty and Kelly's
14-yard run, the Dclts were forced
to resort to long passes, all of which
were knocked down.
