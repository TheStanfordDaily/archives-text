# POOSH 'EM DOWN, TONY
## Former Featherweight Champ Won Lightweight Title In Second Fastest K.O. in History of Division 
### Feg Murray, '16 
So Tony Canzoneri, who formerly
held the world's featherweight title,
i.; the new lightweight champion of
the world, by virtue of the second
fastest K.O. in the history of a divi
sion made famous by such l ing im
portals as McAuliffe, Gans, Nelson,
Wolgast, Ritchie, Welsh, and Leon
ard.
And Al Singer, the built-up boy
from the Bronx, went out like a light
("The Israelite that failed," â€”eh,
i boys?) in even quicker time than
he came into possession of the
crown.
Singer Was Soft
Perhaps Jimmy McLarnin's K.O.
, of Singer a couple of months ago
1 had much to do with softening up
Alibi Al lor Canzoneri's not so po
-1 tent socks to the jaw, but anyhow
it is now definitely established that
the Belting Beauty from the Bronx
is no second Benny Leonard, where
as the Walloping Wop, Tony Can
zoneri, is a crowd pleaser of the first
water.
Canzoneri and Al fought once be

fore, Singer receiving a draw when
most of those present thought he
didn't deserve it.
To the list of those who have won
more than one ttile, add the name
of "Terrible Terry" McGovern, who
outgrew the bantam class and de
feated George Dixon for the feather
weight title in 1900. Some of the
fighters listed were American cham
pions only; they did not necessarily
win two world's crowns.
Return Bout Rumored
Canzoneri won his featherweight
title from Benny Bass in fifteen
rounds on February 10, 1928, and
was dethroned on September 28 of
the same year in a close 15-rounder
by Andre Routis of France. It is
rumored that he has agreed to give
Singer a return bout within four
months.
Tony was born at a small lumber
camp at Syldell, near New Orleans,
on November 6, 1908, and is reputed
to have earned more than a quarter
cf a million dollars since 1925, when
he turned professional.
