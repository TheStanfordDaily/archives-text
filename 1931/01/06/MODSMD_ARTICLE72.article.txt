### Michael Crofoot 
Shattering of eight records and
the tying of a ninth featured the

December 12 on the varsity cinder

the team championship with 58

score of the second-place Delta Tau
Delta group.
Storms Takes Mile
Allan Storms of the Chi Psi's
started the record-setting on the
track by winning the mile run in
4:35 4-5, a time three seconds better
than the old mark. Brugman of the
Delts then ran the 120-yard highs in
15 4-5 seconds to tie the record;
Ilables of Breakers stepped the 220-
yard dash in 21 3-10 seconds to
break his own mark; Gordon of
Breakers set up a new record of
25 3-5 seconds in the 220-yard low
hurdles.
During the trial heats on Decem
ber 10, Frank Lombardi, an inde
pendent, sprinted the century in
9 9-10 seconds to better the record
ol 10 seconds, but whether this mark
will stand, since it was not made in
a final, has not been decided.
Field Records Broken
Stellar performances in the field
events also were the rule. Frank
Lyman of Encina 3W, who is the
holder of the state record for the
12-pound shot, got the 16-pounder
out 4'J feet, 5 inches, thus replacing
Nellie Gray's last year's record by
a foot. Hurling the javelin 191 feet,
Zuger of Theta Chi bettered the old
record of three yards, and Jones of
the Delts established a new discus
record of 142 feet, 9 inches.
Ilables Siars
Les Hables of Breakers turned in
the finest individual performance of
the day, winning the 100-, 200-, and
440-yard dashes, and almost winning
the relay for his team as anchor
man.
Even in those events which were
not won by record-setters the per
formances were good. The results of
the meet should cause Dink Temple
ton to smile and Dean Cromwell to
fiown.

formances were good. The results of
the meet should cause Dink Temple
ton to smile and Dean Cromwell to
fiown.
Shattering of eight records and
the tying of a ninth featured the
intramural track and field meet held
December 12 on the varsity cinder
oval.
Breakers Club was the winner of
the team championship with 58
points, a total more than double the
score of the second-place Delta Tau
Delta group.
Storms Takes Mile
Allan Storms of the Chi Psi's
started the record-setting on the
track by winning the mile run in
4:35 4-5, a time three seconds better
than the old mark. Brugman of the
Delts then ran the 120-yard highs in
15 4-5 seconds to tie the record;
Ilables of Breakers stepped the 220-
yard dash in 21 3-10 seconds to
break his own mark; Gordon of
Breakers set up a new record of
25 3-5 seconds in the 220-yard low
hurdles.
During the trial heats on Decem
ber 10, Frank Lombardi, an inde
pendent, sprinted the century in
9 9-10 seconds to better the record
ol 10 seconds, but whether this mark
will stand, since it was not made in
a final, has not been decided.
Field Records Broken
Stellar performances in the field
events also were the rule. Frank
Lyman of Encina 3W, who is the
holder of the state record for the
12-pound shot, got the 16-pounder
out 4'J feet, 5 inches, thus replacing
Nellie Gray's last year's record by
a foot. Hurling the javelin 191 feet,
Zuger of Theta Chi bettered the old
record of three yards, and Jones of
the Delts established a new discus
record of 142 feet, 9 inches.
Ilables Siars
Les Hables of Breakers turned in
the finest individual performance of
the day, winning the 100-, 200-, and
440-yard dashes, and almost winning
the relay for his team as anchor
man.
Even in those events which were
not won by record-setters the per
formances were good. The results of
the meet should cause Dink Temple
ton to smile and Dean Cromwell to
fiown.
