## Yearling Cagemen Defeat St. Mary's, 28-17; Monterey, 22-14 
### 
By Jack Jernegan
Continuation of the line of strong
freshman basketball teams which
Stanford has produced in the past
few years appears to be indicated by
the auspicious start of the Class of
'34 quintet this season.
Playing speedy, aggressive ball,
the babe cagers downed St. Mary's
freshmen and Monterey High School
by scores of 28-17 and 22-14 respec
tively in their first two games. In
neither contest were the yearlings
hard pressed, although half-time
score in the Monterey tilt Saturday
was G-6.
Centers Rangy
One of the features of the squad
is a pair of towering centers, Pack
ard, a G-foot, 4-inch lad who holds
down the regular berth, and Kuech
ler, ti feet, (> inches, who acts as re
placement. Packard is a very strong
offensive player, being responsible
for many of the freshman field goals,
and makes up for Kuechler's height
advantage by superior ability in
handling himself.
Massey, at left forward, is the
fastest man on ihe team and a con
stant threat when in possession of
the ball.
The rest of the lineup consists of
Saxe. right forward, and Smith and
Wright, guards.
Grasping System
The babe hoopsters appear to have
taken to Coach John Bunn's new
fast-breaking offensive system even
more readily than the varsity men,
the result being that they have pre
sented two very fast games of bas
ketball with a striking absence of
the pauses that often make cage
contests dull.
Poor shooting, however, has
marred the frosh attack somewhat.
They have been unable to sink any
thing near a reasonable percentage
of their chances at the basket.
