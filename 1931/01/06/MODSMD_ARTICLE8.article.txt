# James Perrin Smith, One Of First Faculty Men, Passes At Home
## 
### 
Friends, faculty, and alumni are
mourning the recent passing of Pro
fessor James Perrin Smith, pioneer
member of the Stanford faculty who
passed away New Year's Day after
a brief illness of pneumonia.
"J. P.," as he was affectionately
called by his friends, came to Stan
ford in 1892, a year after the found
ing of the University, and was ac
tive in academic work until he re
tired last June.
Dr. Smith was regarded by scien
tists as being one of the world's
greatest authorities on paleontology.
Outstanding among the honors con
ferred upon him was his election as
a life member of the National Aca
demy of Sciences in 1925 and the
award of the Mary Clark Thompson
gold medal by the academy in 1927
in recognition of his original re
search work in paleontology.
Dr. Smith's principal Held was the
late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic
cephalopoda. Many of his studies
were published by the United States
Geological Survey and professional
societies. His latest monograph on
ammonites for the United States
Geological Survey, completed just
before his death, is now on the
press at Washington.
Dr. Smith is survived by his
widow, Mrs. Florence Hand Smith;
a daughter, Mrs. George F. Calvin of
Oakland, and three sons, Forster
Rand Smith, Howard Carlisle Smith,
and Charles Kirtland Smith.
