# STANFORD'S LAST HORSE NOW DEAD; STEEL DOMINATES
## Trucks Speed Where Once Fine Trotting Horses Were Pastured 
### 
Sweeping remorselessly over the
universe, the mechanical age has at
last buried Stanford University un
der an avalanche of pistons, cylinder
heads, and balloon tires. For at
Stanford, once the site of the famous
Palo Alto Stock Farm where Gov
ernor Leland Stanford bred frimous
trotting horses, there is no longer a
solitary plug.
For years the horse, the eyes of
the army, man's best friend and hi:
severest critic, had waged a losing
war against science on this campus.
Little by little cold, unfeeling trucks,
things of iron and steel, replaced the
noble animal as motive power for
vehicles used in operating the Uni
versity. One by one, the glue fac
tory claimed its victims, and in their
places appeared soulless Fords with
"Stanford University. No. 8' let
tered on the side.
And then, on December 15, the last,
horse on the campus went to the
equine Valhalla, and here, where the
souls of immortal racing horses
hover, the neigh of the nag will echo
nevermore.
