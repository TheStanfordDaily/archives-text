# FEDERAL GROUP RAPS COLLEGES
## Survey Shows Schools Fail As Business Aid 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5. (/P)â€”The
familiar cry of the industrial world
that colleges fail to meet fully busi
ness requirements was repeated to
day by the Federal Office of Edu
cation.
The 69 land grant colleges, en
rolling 16 per cent of the college
population, were criticized by the
federal agency for "failing to study
the demands of the business world."
Outlining the need for higher
business education, covered as part
of its three-year survey of general
problems, the education office as
serted "no institution can justify a
policy of ignorance."
"The discovery of the needs of
business," it said, "is a task the land
grant institutions have almost com
pletely ignored. They have failed to
study the demands of business world
for specific types of training to meet
s] .ecific req u i rements.
"They have put forth little or no
effort in analyzing changing eco
nomic and business conditions and
in making adequate foundation
plans for their educational struc
tures. Except in a few isolated in
stance's, they have exhibited no in
terest in making use of the painful
process of fact gathering as prere
quisite to formulating their policies.
"From the results as reported by
the institutions, it appears they
have not turned the searchlight of
science upon themselves in deter
mining needs for various offerings."
