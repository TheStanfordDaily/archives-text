# HARD TIMES QUOTED AS PROOF OF STATE PAROLE SOUNDNESS

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 5 (A>). —
The test of serious unemployment
has proved the soundness of Califor
nia's parole system, Ed H. Whyte,„
state parole officer, said today.
In periods of widespread unem
ployment police find an increase in
crime, particularly of the bad check
and hold-up variety. But so far as
could be determined unemployment
has not tended to force paroled con
victs to return to crime, Whyte'js rec
ords show. It has made work a little
more difficult for ex-convicts to pro
cure as it has for others, but other
wise there has been no material dif
ference in the situation.
Whyte said it is much better for
the state and for the convict, in
many eases, if he is paroled before
his sentence has expired, as the man
who leaves prison with his time
fully served goes out into the world
without restrictions and often re
turns to crime, whereas the paroled
man is guided and counseled until 1
his term expires, and i.s enabled to
make a gradual readjustment to
society.
