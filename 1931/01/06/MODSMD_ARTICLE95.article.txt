# LACK OF FINANCES MAY OCCASION END OF STANFORD BAND
## 
### 
Unless more adequate finances are
made available, the Stanford band
may become a thing of the past.
This is the opinion of prominent
members and officials of the or
ganization, expressed as a result of
the somewhat tentative resignation
recently of Dr. E. Whitney Martin,
for many years director of the band.
There is said to be much reluc
tance on the part of band members
to accept Dr. Martin's resignation as
final, especially in view of the fact
that funds being furnished the band
at present would be inadequate to
provide another leader of the neces
sary capability.
Among the proposals that have
been made to adjust the situation is
one which would establish another
musical organization, a concert
band, in addition to the present
military type band. However, it is
declared that this proposition is not
likely to be carried out, due to in
adequate facilities and material.
If Dr. Martin's resignation be
comes definite, he will act as band
librarian and in an advisory capa
city.
