THE men who go to the univer
sities of Virginia and Kentucky
j know tobacco .. . they see how it
grows and what makes it good.
So when Virginia students, and
the men who stroll down old South
Limestone Street in Lexington,
pack their pipes with Edgeworth,
their choice tells volumes about the
! cool, slow-burning quality of this
favorite smoking tQbacco.
It's the same story everywhere-
North, South, East and West. In
42 out of 54 leading colleges and
universities, college men prefer the
Bmooth, fragrant hurley blend of
Edgeworth. Try Edgeworth your
, self. You'll find more pleasure in
a pipe than you ever knew before.
Every tobacco store has Edge
worth, 15ff the tin. Or, for generous
free sample, write to Larus & Bro.
