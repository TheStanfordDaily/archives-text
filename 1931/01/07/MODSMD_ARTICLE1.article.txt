### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (A*)— Se
cretary Wilbur today declared himself
against a tariff on oil.
Such a tariff, as proposed from
time to time by some of the leading
producers and recently by E. B. Ree
ser, president of the American Pe
troleum Institute, would be of little
value to the small producer, the Sec
retary asserted.
Big Companies Profit
"The chief result," he said, "would
be that the big companies, which
now have many wells shut in and
not in operation, would open them
up, adding to the production. Over
production is the basic ill of the in
dustry.
"Besides this," he added, "our im
ports of petroleum are negligible,
forming only about 10 per cent of
the production. Our exports account
for 15 per cent of the total produc
tion."
The secretary, who is Chairman of
the Federal Oil Conservation Board,
said in his opinion America should
import most of its oil, and save its
own supply for some future day.
Must Conserve
"In the future," he asserted, "the
country with the oil will dominate
civilization. In it will be centered
the wealth. America must conserve
her supply!"
Utilization of oil fields, if adopted
several years ago, he said, would
have solved many of the problems of
the industry.
