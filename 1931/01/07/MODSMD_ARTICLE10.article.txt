# DAVIS RECEIVES ROYAL SEND-OFF
## Firemen Take Newlyweds On Campus lour 
### 
Heralded around the campus by
Fire Chief Dugan's throaty siren,
and riding in the Fresh Air Taxi,
"Campus Cop" Gordon Davis started
married life yesterday morning in
a manner unexpectedâ€”by him.
The fire house "boys" were re
sponsible. Davis and his bride, Miss
J. Beatrice Keller, of San Jose,
parked their car behind the Me
morial Church at 11 o'clock, and
entered for Dr. Charles Gardner's
matrimonial blessing.
While the ceremony was going
on, the fire house gang towed Davis'
car away and substituted a cut
down, pre-war, well-branded fliv
ver. A uniformed driver was at the
pedals, and draped over the "Just
Married" sign were two long
branches from a nearby palm tree.
Grinning and protesting without
effect, the newly married couple
were rushed into the "taxi" ;ind
driven around the Quad and up the
Row before being released.
Until next week, when Davis re
turns to his duties here, a decreas
ing number of arrests can be ex
pected.
