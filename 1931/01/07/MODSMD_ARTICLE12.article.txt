# FRENCH REPUBLIC PAYS LAST HOMAGE TO LATE MARSHAL
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. G. (/P) â€”France today
paid its last sad homage to the still
form of Marshal Joffrc as it lay
banked by flowers on a catafalque
in the chapel of the Ecole Militaire.
Tonight., in a plain oak coffin
which will never be opened again,
the Marshal's body lay in the
Cathedral of Notre Dame. On the
coffin was the simple inscription
"Joseph Joffrc, Marshal of France,
1852-1931."
Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock,
cfter funeral services in the cathe
dral, an impressive cortege will es
cort the body to the Invalides, where
it will repose in a vault for several
months before being buried in its
final resting place at Louveciennes.
Thousands still flood outside the
Ecole Militaire, waiting vainly for
a last look at the dead hero, when
the doors were closed at 8 o'clock
tonight and the Marshal's body
placed in its coffin.
