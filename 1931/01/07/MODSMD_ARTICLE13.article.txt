# WOMEN PILOTS BREAK 42-HOUR FLIGHT RECORD
## Monoplane Circles Toward Men's Endurance Mark In Face of Rain, Wind 
### 
| LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6 (A*)â€” Bo
b, bie Trout, with a new girl flying
I partner, Edna May Cooper, actress
i and aviatrix, set a new women's en
i durance flight record today. At 9:47
i o'clock this morning she piloted the
"Lady Rolph" an hour past the pre
vious record of 42 hours, 16 minutes,
set by herself and Elinor Smith, New
York aviatrix, some months ago.
Soaring on beyond the new fem
inine mark, the two swung around
another milestone in their flight this
afternoon. At 8 o'clock tonight the
i trim monoplane had been in the air
52 hours. The girl fliers declare they
aim to crack, if possible, the present
men's mark of 645 hours, held by
Dale Jackson and Forest O'Brine of
St. Louis.
The monotonous round above the
Municipal Airport was abandoned
for three hours between today's re
fueling times. The girls hied them
selves in search of new scenes, feast-
J ing their eyes and hearts on aerial
views of Hollywood, Beverly Hills,
Santa Monica and the beaches.
Rough air, from a choppy wind
which followed last night's inconven
ient rainstorm, upset the noon re
; fueling. Miss Cooper got a shower
bath of gasoline, and the Lady Rolph
obtained but 38 gallons of fuel. An
emergency refueling was made at
mid-afternoon, when the air was
comparatively quiet.
