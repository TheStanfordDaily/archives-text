### 
NATAL, Brazil, Jan. G (/P) —Ten
great Italian seaplanes roared down
( into the harbor here today between
4:15 and 4:40 o'clock to complete one
Jof the most ambitious aviation
projects ever attempted. Another of
j the 12 scheduled to leave Bolama,
! Portuguese Guinea, early this
! morning was forced down near St.
! Paul Rock, off the Brazilian coast
j and it was reported that the twelfth
i was unable to rise from the West
African coast as the others took off.
(Official sources in Rome announced
! that all 12 planes began the flight,
with two forced down at sea and
; taken in charge by Italian warcraft
which lined the route over the South
j Atlantic.)
The flight of 1,875 miles was com

passed the Dariceo, first of the Ital
ian vessels along the route. At 4:37
| G.M.T., they passed the Tarigo and
j7:06, same time, flew over the Vi
valdo.

Thereafter they sped over the toss
j ing ocean and crossed the lonely
island of Fernando Do Noronha at
2:55 o,'clock, swung straight for St.
j Paul Rock, and finally zipped to a
stop on the waters of Natal Harbor,
at 4:15 o'clock. A great croyd was
' out to welcome the visitors, the
'people coming from miles around de-
I spite heavy rains last night and it
I was a thrilling moment not only for
! the natives, but for the aviators who
had completed such a long and haz
ardous trip.
