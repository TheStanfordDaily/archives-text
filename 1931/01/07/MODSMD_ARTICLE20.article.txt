## 
### 
High hopes that Einstein would
1 include Stanford in his list of places
I to be visited in this country and
perhaps confer with some of the
; local savants, were dashed to earth
yesterday by Professor D. L. Web
ster's revelation of a talk with Dr.
Robert A. Millikan, who is perhaps
closest to the world-famed author of
the relativity theory.
Asked if there was any truth to
the report that Einstein would be
seen soon on the Stanford campus,
Dr. Millikan, the retiring president
ef the Association for the Advance
ment of Science, a meeting of which
Dr. Webster attended in Cleveland
last week as head of the Stanford I
Physics department, stated that as
far as he knew, and in his opinion, ,

i Einstein would not come to Stan
! ford. Though be hadn't yet met Ein-
J stein, Dr. Millikan was of the belief
1 that important scientific meetings
1 would keep Einstein at California
I Tech. Dr. Webster yesterday de
| clared that, since his last talk no
| word about Einstein had come from
; Millikan, but that possibly definite
word would be along soon.
While in Cleveland Dr. Webster
t also attended the meetings of the
I American Physical Society, acting as
! a member of the central council
which announced a program of con
solidation of all societies interested
| in physics. About a dozen members
,of the Stanford faculty, he said,
I were in Cleveland during the holi
! days, attending various society
i meet inns.
