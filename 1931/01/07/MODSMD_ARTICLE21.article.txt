## Says No Probability Of Continental War 
### 
Dr. Jesse B. Sears, professor of
! education, summarized his impres
i sions of his recent trip through Eu
i rope last evening in the Little
Theatre. Accompanied by his wife
and two sons, Professor Sears spent
five months visiting various locali
i ties in England, Holland, Belgium,
i Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
Italy, and France.
"People in Europe look like our
people in America, dress the same,
have similar manners, and their
business dealings resemble ours, as
far as can be judged from the su
perficial contact of the traveller,"
said the lecturer in answer to a re
quest for a comparison between the
; two continents.
Strong Nationalism
"From the standpoint of business
efficiency, the Americans are much
S superior, while the manners of the
| Europeans are better than ours, as
they are the fruit of a much older
i culture. They seem to be more seri
ous and scholarly inclined.
"There is obviously a great deal of
politics in Europe. The feeling of
j nationality is exceedingly strong,
j and the citizens of the various
I countries seem to fear and hate each
other to such an extent that it is
I difficult to realize a peaceful and
I harmonious relation between the
I countries. Labor conditions are poor,
j and there are thousands out of
j work; women are seen doing many
! of the menial tasks, and great econ
! omy is practiced. The use of mod
ern machinery and conveniences is
i very limited.
Europe Poor
i "A move of some sort will un
! doubtedly occur within the next
I few years, but the people are kept
' from going to war for several eco
nomic reasons. Conditions seem too
! poor, and they are lacking in lead
ers and any great genius. The coun
j tries haven't the money nor the
credit necessary. Thirdly, those who
were there at the time of the last
i war are completely stupified and
licked, and have insufficient energy
1 tc go to war.
"I was surprised to find the peo
ple as a whole do not trust one
another, and there is no trust or
credit between the business houses
as in America. A remnant of the
I royalty 'stuff' is still existing in Eu
rope, maintained by the present
poverty and the Church."

i sions of his recent trip through Eu
i rope last evening in the Little
Theatre. Accompanied by his wife
and two sons, Professor Sears spent
five months visiting various locali
i ties in England, Holland, Belgium,
i Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
Italy, and France.
"People in Europe look like our
people in America, dress the same,
have similar manners, and their
business dealings resemble ours, as
far as can be judged from the su
perficial contact of the traveller,"
said the lecturer in answer to a re
quest for a comparison between the
; two continents.
Strong Nationalism
"From the standpoint of business
efficiency, the Americans are much
S superior, while the manners of the
| Europeans are better than ours, as
they are the fruit of a much older
i culture. They seem to be more seri
ous and scholarly inclined.
"There is obviously a great deal of
politics in Europe. The feeling of
j nationality is exceedingly strong,
j and the citizens of the various
I countries seem to fear and hate each
other to such an extent that it is
I difficult to realize a peaceful and
I harmonious relation between the
I countries. Labor conditions are poor,
j and there are thousands out of
j work; women are seen doing many
! of the menial tasks, and great econ
! omy is practiced. The use of mod
ern machinery and conveniences is
i very limited.
Europe Poor
i "A move of some sort will un
! doubtedly occur within the next
I few years, but the people are kept
' from going to war for several eco
nomic reasons. Conditions seem too
! poor, and they are lacking in lead
ers and any great genius. The coun
j tries haven't the money nor the
credit necessary. Thirdly, those who
were there at the time of the last
i war are completely stupified and
licked, and have insufficient energy
1 tc go to war.
"I was surprised to find the peo
ple as a whole do not trust one
another, and there is no trust or
credit between the business houses
as in America. A remnant of the
I royalty 'stuff' is still existing in Eu
rope, maintained by the present
poverty and the Church."
