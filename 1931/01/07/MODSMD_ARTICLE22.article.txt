### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 6. (A 3 ) â€”
Max Katz, clothicr, knows how a
fly feels wading around on a paper
of "Tanglefoot."
A bandit visited Max today and
tangled him all up with a roll of
2-inch adhesive tape at. gun-point.
With fingers, cars, mouth, arms,
legs, and face stuck up by the Jape,
Max saw the bandit take $17 from a
register, pack a suitcase with cloth
ing, and pick up a wrist-watch on
his way out.
