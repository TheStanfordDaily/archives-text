# HARVARD PROFESSOR PLANS TO MEASURE EARTHQUAKE SHOCKS

### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 6 (/P) —
Dr. L. Don Lcet, in chargc of the
Harvard seismograph station, plans
to produce artificial earthquake
shocks next summer. The shocks will
be produced by dynamite. They will
be measured by portable seismo
graphs.
The experiments will take two
forms. One will be the measurement
of the speed with which vibrations
travel through granite. The other
will be the measuring of the thick
ness of drifts left by glaciers 10,000
years ago, revealing the original for
mation of the land.
Geologists have long believed that
the continents were underlain by
granite. They have been trying for
many years to determine how thick
this layer is. The only means of
study has been, and still is, the ve
locities with which earthquake
waves travel through it.
