# COACH GROOMS HOOPSTERS FOR COMING SEASON
## Varsity Men Prepare For First Conference Tilt With U.C.L.A. TEAM GOES THURSDAY 
### Jack Jernegan 
Having the experience of live
practice games with teams of vary
ing strength behind them, the Stan
ford varsity basketball men yester
day swung into the final stage of
preparation for the conference sea
son.
Being pretty well satisfied with
his defense, Coach John Bunn put
in his time during the workout on
smoothing out the kinks in his of
fensive maneuvers. A fast scrim
mage betwe'en two quintets made up
of reserves, men who did not play
against Montana, was the chief fea
ture of the practice. Bunn laid spe
cial emphasis on speed in getting
the ball down the court to the bas
ket, and frequently halted the
scrimmage to point out mistakes
which slowed up the attack.
Reserve Team
On the "white" team Don Tyler
|at forward stood out through his
speedy dribbling and fast break
down the court. At the other for
ward post Reggie Meade, who has
been out for some time through ill
ness, looked good. Bonner held down
the center position with Tway and
Hancock at guards. The "grays"
were Hepp and Kelley, forwards;
Colvin, center; McElwain and War
ren, guards, with Hepp being the
most noticeable.
I A session of free-throw practice
and a prolonged chalk-talk made up
the afternoon's program before the
scrimmage.
Unison Needed
Coach Bunn remarked that while
; the Montana game was tho fastest,
the Cardinals have yet played, the
team as a whole was somewhat in
consistent. At times they appeared
to let down and "take time out
' without notifying the referee." The
i chief need of the squad now, ac
coring to Bunn, is to smooth out
its play and work consistently in
! unison.
Thursday night the team will
leave for Los Angeles where it will
open the conference schedule in two
contests with U.C.L.A. No squad for
the trip south will be chosen until
Thursday, owing to the uncertainty
about whether Jimmy Mears will
have recovered sufficiently from the
injury to his ankle received Sunday
in practice to play.
