# SUICIDE AS CURE FOR INSOMNIA IS FAILURE

### 
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Jan. 6 (/P) â€”
Some time last night, Dan McCon
ville, 70, fired a bullet into his head.
No one was more surprised than
lie when death did not result.
This morning, he was still alive so
he went to a doctor and had his head
dressed. He said he hadn't been able
to .sleep for six months.
His recovery is expected and with
help for his insomnia in prospect,
life looks brighter to him today.
