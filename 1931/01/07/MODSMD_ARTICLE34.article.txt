< )iiee agaill football was the only Stanford sport to pay its own
way, according to official figures recently released in report of the
Hoard of Athletic Control for the fiscal year ending August 31,
1030. } J ,ni King football enriched the 15.A.C. coffers by some $460,-
000. which is quite a tidy sum.
The other major sports all lost from $2,500 to $5,500 each.
I'.oxing came closer to breaking even than any other loser with a
deficit of onlv $330. However, football profits were large enough
so that $370,000 was left after all sports accounts had been bal
anced.
Anv doubts as to the ability of the golf course to pay its own
way were dispelled when it was announced that the Stanford links
made a net gain of $0,000 in its first seven months of operation.
However, payments on the new women's gym and I'ranner I fall
are financed bv football profits as well as the new sunken diamond
and swimming pools. Also intramural and Interclass athletics, the
band, stadium maintenance, and a portion ot the department ol
Musical Kducatiou and medical service expenses are some of the
other items borne by the board.
