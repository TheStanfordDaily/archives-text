# HELL WEEK RECEIVES A BLOW
## 
### 
The resolutions and platforms of the National Intcrfraternitv
C onference in opposing "such nefarious practices" as Hell Week
have taken effect, al least in one fraternity. I'hi Kappa, in its con
vention, has decided t<> abolish the period of concentrated hazing
for the pledges known as "11 ell Week."
The Xational Intcrfraternitv Conference started its drive against.
11 iis idea last year in its annual convention. It voted to go on record
as strongly against such practices, and offered substitutes for llell
Week'. However, the Conference is such a body that can'only rec
ommend and offer resolutions, and ot course, has no actual power
behind. We arc glad to see, however, that its platform has been
c onsidered and followed by Phi Kappa.
fraternities. according to statement made on the campus last fall
by a representative of the Xational Interfraternitv Conference, have
failed to gain the esteem and regard of the public by following such
practices as Hell Week. Deaths, serious accidents, and numberless
minor, but provoking injuries, have been the result of many llell
Weeks in colleges and universities over the country. It is because of
11 lis, the Conference believes, our parents, the legislatures, and the
general public, lack confidence in the fraternity as a social organiza
t ion.
Hut, with the action of I'hi Kappa in abolishing all forms of 11 ell
Week, it seems that a step forward has been taken and fraternities
ina\ now adopt policies of a more sensible nature. More may billow
Phi Kappa's example,- The Daily llliui.
