PHILIPPA. By Anne Douglas Sedg
wick. Houghton iVIIITIiii Co., Bos
ton, 1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
; Shop.)
Aldous loved his daughter Philip
-1 pa, loved her so greatly that he
allowed her to destroy unconsciously
his only chance of happiness. He is
not supposed to be so importan! as
Philippu in character, but as her
story progresses, he becomes path
| etic, .until his life assumes aspects
of tragic emptiness.
"Philippu" is by no means a great
or even an excellent book. It is in
teresting, and usually realistic, al
| though, perhaps because of com
! pression of material, lack of ex
-1 planation leads to artificiality.
Philippa herself is impulsive,
amazingly outspoken, and practical
minded. She sees herself through
I her father, and by mentioning his
interest in Cosima, precipitates a
1 misunderstanding that separates him
from her mother. From then on ii is
1 a battle between Cosima and the
"invincible" Philippa. The unfortu
nate part of Miss Sedgwick's book is
that the duel of personalities forces
Philippa's mother, who had gained
instant sympathy with her readers,
1 into a dull retirement. . ■ —J. N.

UP THIS LADHRK OF COLD. By
I IS. Phillips Oppenheim. Little,
Brown. (Al the Palo Alto Book
i Shop.)
Mr. Oppenheim tossed up a pair
' of carved jade dice and they floated
' wearily down through the smoke of
a Corona Corona to rest gently on
the massive table before him. He
glanced carelessly at them, decided
j that his next Master Mind should
be a heroic struggle rather than a
smiling, quite dangerous villain. But
such an historic act has not at all
perturbed Mr. Oppenheim's vener

! iible plot and there is still the cor
rect proportion of murders, stolen j
papers, etc.
You may snicker at the bland j
older of Mr. Oppenheim's editorial i
protagonist to send the market |
down to a new low when he flicks '
il carelessly to his secretary; you ,
may gasp at the indomitable pig- ■
headedness of the villainous element j
(The only explanation for their i
stupidity in struggling against an i
Oppenheim hero is that they are I
Oppenheim villains); you may be \
dazzled at the nonchalant attitude of ;
blase minor characters as they j
bandy about international fates; the j
romance of settings in London clubs, j
on the Riviera, at Monte Carlo's I
wicked Casino, in yachts and air- ;
planes, may excite the imagination; j
you may emote thus when all of j
these elements come into your view. I
But there is only one possible effect ,
j imaginable which may appear upon ;
! perusal of the conclusion —hysteria, j
Oh yes, this week's output is '
! vivid. —J- S. S.
TIIK RIGHT TO LOVE—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Added to her superlative ability as j
an actress, good vehicles are se- ;
lected for Ruth Chatterton, "first i
I lady of the screen." This time it's j
! "The Right to Love," taken from j
! Susan Glaspell's "Brook Evans," a j
' story well suited to the screen and !
to the star.
Although she portrays a very ;
young girl, which undoubtedly will
draw a little criticism from "those i
presuming her age, Miss Chatterton •
! turns out another excellent por- !
trayal to add to an already fat list 1
of successes. Sound and photo- j
graphy are better than usual in this |
i Paramount picture, and competent i
support is given by David Manners, I
[Irving Pichel, and others. —J. T.
