PHILIPPA. By Anne Douglas Sedg
wick. Houghton iVIIITIiii Co., Bos
ton, 1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
; Shop.)
Aldous loved his daughter Philip
-1 pa, loved her so greatly that he
allowed her to destroy unconsciously
his only chance of happiness. He is
not supposed to be so importan! as
Philippu in character, but as her
story progresses, he becomes path
| etic, .until his life assumes aspects
of tragic emptiness.
"Philippu" is by no means a great
or even an excellent book. It is in
teresting, and usually realistic, al
| though, perhaps because of com
! pression of material, lack of ex
-1 planation leads to artificiality.
Philippa herself is impulsive,
amazingly outspoken, and practical
minded. She sees herself through
I her father, and by mentioning his
interest in Cosima, precipitates a
1 misunderstanding that separates him
from her mother. From then on ii is
1 a battle between Cosima and the
"invincible" Philippa. The unfortu
nate part of Miss Sedgwick's book is
that the duel of personalities forces
Philippa's mother, who had gained
instant sympathy with her readers,
1 into a dull retirement. . ■ —J. N.

PHILIPPA. By Anne Douglas Sedg
wick. Houghton iVIIITIiii Co., Bos
ton, 1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
; Shop.)
Aldous loved his daughter Philip
-1 pa, loved her so greatly that he
allowed her to destroy unconsciously
his only chance of happiness. He is
not supposed to be so importan! as
Philippu in character, but as her
story progresses, he becomes path
| etic, .until his life assumes aspects
of tragic emptiness.
"Philippu" is by no means a great
or even an excellent book. It is in
teresting, and usually realistic, al
| though, perhaps because of com
! pression of material, lack of ex
-1 planation leads to artificiality.
Philippa herself is impulsive,
amazingly outspoken, and practical
minded. She sees herself through
I her father, and by mentioning his
interest in Cosima, precipitates a
1 misunderstanding that separates him
from her mother. From then on ii is
1 a battle between Cosima and the
"invincible" Philippa. The unfortu
