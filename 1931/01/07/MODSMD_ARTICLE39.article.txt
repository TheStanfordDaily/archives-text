Alter a brief intermission for finals
j and New Year celebration, we're an
1 athletic-minded mob, again. While
we're eating peanuts at basketball
j games, the baseball coach is t think
ing about his spring practice season
coming up. He has only eight Kappa
Sigs listed on the first nine, though,
and the final first string be
i announced till another is found.
Vacationers in and around Los
| Angeles were impressed by the
strenuous public reform movement
' going on there. Another example of
cause and effect. The L.A. Record
1 says: "Buron Fitts Opens Drive on
Crime." The Stanford Daily: "Sin
: Takes a Holiday" at the Stanford
Theatre."
Which reminds us of the
Brightest Freshman, who says
that loud talkies are hellow
j drama.

I The now system of grade poinls i
has caused more envy and ensuing j
disgust than anything we've heard i
of in a long time. If someone tells j
you lie's gone "plus 40," look him !
straight in the eye and demand a !
confession. It means only about
two-and-a-half B's or so. Heart
failure among students is greatly in
creased by the transcripts sent out
i with grades, with a large "subject
i to honorable dismissal" at the hot*-
torn of the page.
Not to be sacrilegious, but an
authority vouches for the origin
; (and really refined humour) of this '
statement taken from the Book of :
j Isaiah, in the Bible: "Then the an
gel of the Lord went forth, and .
I smote in ihe camp of the Assyrians
' n hundred and four score and five
thousand; and when they arose in J
the morning, behold, they were all
i dead corpses." Well ....
