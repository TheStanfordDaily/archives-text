The dean of the University of
Boston claims that a college
education is worth $72,000 in the
life of a student after gradua
tion. While the statement may
he true, the number of college
men selling Andrew Mel lon's
aluminum, stocks, bonds, and
vacuum cleaners would seem to
contradict his contention.
But attempting to analyze college
[ education in terms of financial re-
I turn is not only difficult but dan-
I gerous as well. Even if a cultural
: education were a positive financial
liability (and there is plenty of evi
' dcnce to support such an idea), it
I would still be worthwhile.
; The president of Rollins Univer
sity feels that students should qui/.
, professors rather than the present
system.
But whoever gives quizzes will
find that the person taking them
is ignorant of some questions;
and many professors still believe
that Ihe professor and God know
all and never err.
The University of Georgh, feeling
that students deserve the same con
sideration as laborers, is advocating
five-day weeks.
Ever since childhood, Satur
day has always been devoted to
marbles and other enjoyable
pursuits. Why students must he
forced to attend Saturday classes
is beyond the comprehension of
ordinary mortals there.
The University of Wisconsin
claims that at many colleges foot
ball is not only God but all the
angels too.
At the end of every football
season, after the college treas
uries have been enriched by
millions due to football, there is
launched a perennial attack on
the "demon of modern educa
tion" — intercollegiate football,
much to the amusement of the
Badgers.
