CA(iE CHATTER
Having played U.C.L.A., U.S.C.,
Stanford, and the University of Cali
fornia, the Univergjty of Montana
barnstorming basketeers have done
the sports public of the state a great
service. With the conference curtain
rising Friday night in the South,
where Stanford meets the Bruins of
Westwood, a line on the compara
tive merits of the four teams may
be secured. •

However, comparative scorcs
are a tricky foundation for any
analysis of the merits of quin
tets. The Grizzlies, although los
ing two contests to the Bruins
and splitting even in their two
game set-to with the Trojans,
were more impressed by the
Southern California live than by
the U.C.L.A. team. Figure that
one out.
With the results of the University
ol California-University of Montana
game an unknown quality as we
write this, we regard the Golden
Bears as the dark horse of the race.
Nibs Price's cage crews always im
prove as the season progresses, and
the Berkeley team should prove to
be a factor in the cage struggle.
As we see it.the Trojans are
the team to beat, with their
next-door neighbors at West
wood a close competitor. And
the Cardinals open with U.C.L.A.
Friday and Saturday night, so
it would appear that the Indians
are rapidly approaching their
first crucial contests. In this
league, al! of the games are cru
cial.
As for Stanford —we should rate
higher in the linal Conference stand
ings that we did last season, but
bow closely the Cardinals will press
the leaders remains to be seen. It is
not asking too much for the team
to win more than two of their nine
games, at any rate, and that will
be an improvement.
Such is the story of the dope
sheet. On Friday, festivities be
gin in earnest, and from then
until the final game almost any
thing may happen. All four
teams appear to be fairly evenly
matched, with no one ball club
deserving an edge. The Trojans
have dropped several contests
to exceptional club teams,
U.C.L.A. has been a trifle for
tunate to date, California has
been a doubtful quality, while
the locals are better than they
were a year ago.
Strangely enough, Stanford looked
belter in losing to San Francisco
(linn in winning from Montana.
Starting rapidly, the Cardinals
slowed down during the latter part
ol the first half against the Grizzlies
and nevre regained the speed of
their opening play. With a faster
break, the Bunn bunch at least pro
vides a more rapid game for the
spectators, and Monday's crowd was
the largest to witness a cage clash
Ibis season.
Rudy Rintala, while not as ef
fective against Montana as be
had been in previous sessions,
lias turned in three full-time
games now. But Vance Fawcett,
working as he has not worked
before, showed his best game to
date Monday. Smooth-working
Vance ripples about the court in
outstanding fashion. -r-L. K., Jr.
