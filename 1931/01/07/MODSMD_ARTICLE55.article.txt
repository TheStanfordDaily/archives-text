# Forty-One Teams Enter Mural Basket Tourney
## INITIAL CONTESTS OPEN MONDAY TOR '31 CHAMPIONSHIP Hastings Basket Trophy Is Additional Incentive To Contenders 
### 
Entered in the 1931 intramural
basketball championship, which
gets under way next Monday, are
forty-one quintets, representing vir
tually every fraternity, club, and
dormitory on the campus.
As usual the great number of en
trants has made this particular
championship the biggest plum of
all the intramural titles. To the final
survivor of the forty-one will be
awarded 50 points toward the year's
intramural championship, a leg on
the Hastings basketball trophy, and
much glory.
May Win Trophy
Five organizations, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Chi Psi,
Kappa Alpha, and Sigma Chi, each
of which has won the title once, will
be competing with an added incen
tive, since the Hastings trophy is
given permanently to the group first
winning it twice.
Sigma Chi, winners of the 1930
title, and all but one of last year's
league leaders, will be on hand to
defend their honors.
The forty-one entrants have been
divided by lot into seven leagues of
six teams each. The leading team in
each league will reeeive 40 intra
mural points, only 10 less than the
school champion. After these league
titles have been decided by the
playing of round robin schedules,
the winners play for the school title.
One More Opening
There is room in the tournament
for one more quintet if there are no
withdrawals, according to Parker
Reed, student director of intramural
athletics. Encina Hall has only or
ganized three teams of the eight it

zoning system.
