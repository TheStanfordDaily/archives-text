# THOSE WERE THE DAYS
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Ten years ago Strangler Lewis
won the world's heavyweight wres
tling championship from Joe Stecher
[ in one hour and forty-one minutes
' at the 71st Regiment Armory, New
j York, N.Y. Five minutes before the
I finish 8,000 "raslin'" fans went wild
â–  as Stecher apparently had Lewis on
| the verge of defeat, but the head
! lock expert rallied and, applying his
favorite hold, won the title. Also ten
years ago: Wrestlers in Mitchell,
South Dakota, fell through a win
dow and into an auto ten feet be
low . . . Frank Moran K.O.'d Joe
Beckett in London . . . and Brocco
i and Coburn won the 6-day bike race
I at Madison Square Garden.
Twenty years ago Willie Hoppe,
j the "boy wonder," retained his
'world's billiard championship by de
| feating George Slosson 1,000 to 471
j in the Concert Hall of old Madison
Square Garden. Also twenty years
ago: Christy Mathewson beat Ben
' Scully, the blind champion of Amer
ica. at Lyric Hall in a checker con
test . . . Stan Zbyszko threw two op
ponents at Grand Central Palace . . .
and George Foster Sanford, Yale
1 football coach, announced that he
was opposed to allowing forward
) passes over the line of scrimmage.
Thirty years ago Walter Camp

chose seven Yale men on his All-
America team. You don't find one
seventh of that number on this
year's selections, made by the fifty
seven varieties of successors to the
late "Father of American Football."
The seven stalwart Elis chosen were
Bloomer and Stillman, tackles;
Brown, guard; Olcott, center;
Fincke, quarterback; Chadwick,
halfback, and Hale, fullback. It
seems that Bill Morley, Columbia
captain, did manage to sneak into
the backfield. Also thirty years ago:
Malcolm D. Whitman was ranged
No. 1 in men's tennis . . . Daly de
feated Tod Sloan, the jockey, in a
live bird shooting contest . . . and
Thomas W. Lawson offered to build
a yacht to defend the America's Cup
against Lipton's Shamrock 11.
Forty years ago Walter Camp
honored "Ma" Newell for the first
time at the tackle position. Newell
was also on Mr. Camp's teams for
the next three years. He not only
was a master of position play and
could use his hands like a Jim Dris
coll, but he was a high-principled
man who was beloved by all who
knew him, and who was a fine in
fluence on all wilh whom he came
in contact. Ham Fish was Harvard's
other "greatest" tackle.
