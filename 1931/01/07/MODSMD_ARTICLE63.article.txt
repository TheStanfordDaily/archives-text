# FROSH HOOPSTERS TO TANGLE WITH GREY FOG BABES
## Coach Bunn Drills Frosh In Basic Play To Build Next Year's Team 
### 
With the varsity squad journeying
south for two games this week-end
with U.C.L.A., basketball interest on
the campus this week will center on
the freshmen, who will tangle with
the San Francisco University year
lings at the Pavilion Saturday night.
Jimmy Mears, substitute for Cap
tain Mike Reynolds at center on the
varsity, will probably have charge
of the frosh while Coach Bunn is in
Los Angeles.
Mears' injured ankle is not ex
pected to be in condition to allow
him to play against the Bruins.
Bunn concentrated on fundament
als in yesterday's frosh practice, the
babes having put up a ragged game
in losing to Ukiah High School, 20
to 18, Monday night.
Characterizing the play of the
freshmen as the poorest they have
shown this season, the Indian coach
said yesterday that with better in
dividual work they could have eas
ily won the contest.
Bunn, however, is not greatly in
terested in the winning or losing of
individual games, being particularly
desirous of grounding the first-year
men in fundamentals so that they
will make good varsity material
later.
"Their Record in games won and
lost this season will not make a
great deal of difference in their fu
ture work on the varsity," Bunn
said. "What I am interested in is
giving them a thorough grounding
in fundamentals, and they showed a
lack of this against Ukiah."
The yearlings showed much
promise in early games this season,
winning easily over the St. Mary's
babes and over Monterey High
School. Another week's work may
bring them out of the skimp they
exhibited in the Ukiah contest.
