# BRANDSTEN PREDICTS SUCCESSFUL SEASON FOR AQUATIC MEN
## 
### 
Simultaneously with the resump
tion of both varsity and freshman
swimming practice yesterday after- i
noon, Coach Ernst Brandsten pre
dicted one of the most successful
seasons for the Cardinal aquatic
' men since he began coaching here
I in 1914.
In only two events will the 1931
varsity show any considerable weak
ness, Brandsten declared. Absence j
oi Pete Desjardins because of an
I eligibility ruling leaves Bill Camp
bell as probably the best diver,
' while transfer of Herman Fletcher
to a northern university is a serious (
loss lo the breaststroke event.
Holding of the national junior
water polo championships on the
west coast sometime during next j
March or April should prove lo be
an added incentive to Stanford's
; water polo team, which also faces a
very promising season, the coach
said.
| Besides Brandsten, Assistant |
| Coaches Ted Smith and Sprague
will continue in supervision of
swimming practice throughout the ,
winter quarter.
Austin Clapp, Tuppy Gardner, ;
Jack McKelvey, Jack Trotter, and |
Frank Booth, Brandsten named as !
this season's stars in the free-style
sprint events. Burns, Simons, and
Harris in th*e breaststroke; Clapp,
Booth, and de Silva in the back
stroke; and Campbell, Clark, Weyl,
and Fraser in the diving, should be
the other outstanding members of ;
the squad, according to the coach.
