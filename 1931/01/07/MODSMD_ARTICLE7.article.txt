# B.A.C. WILL NOT AID BAND FUND
## Masters Says Further Aid Up To University 
### 
Any increase in financial support j
of the Stanford Band by the Board ]
cf Athletic Control is unlikely is j
the opinion of General Manager Al- j
fred Masters of the BA.C.
Leaders of the band have declared I
1 that the organization is threatened
with extinction if additional support
is not obtained, but according to
Masters the rigid economy program
■ now being instituted by the athletic
i body will make it difficult if not
: impossible for the board to give aid.
At present the B.A.C. contributes
$1,000 yearly, and this sum consti- j
tutes the greater part of the band's j
resources. The attitude of the board, i
1 Masters says, is that this money is ;
payment for the services of the j
musical organization at games, not |
a recognition of any obligation to ;
support the band. Pie believes that j
the question of helping the musi- j
cians is up to the University ad
ministration.
