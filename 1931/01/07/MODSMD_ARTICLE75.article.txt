# ERECTION OF NEW TRAFFIC CONTROLS FURTHER DELAYED
## Equipment on Hand Doesn't Comply With State Specifications 
### 
Although the equipment for the
erection of a traffic control system
at the intersection of El Camino
Real and University Avenue is al
ready on hand its installment will
be further delayed. As the result of
a decision of the board of public
works the City of Palo Alto will ask
the state highway commission for a
modification of their specifications.
The equipment the city has ob
tained does not conform to the
specifications as laid down by the
state. It is considered that the re
quirements of the state involve an
unnecessary expense.
According to the state's plans a
system of eight signal devices was
to be erected; Stanford and Palo
Alto have made arrangements for
four posts which are not the size
specified by the state.
The highway commission provided
that the signals be manually con
trolled, while the city desires to
operate them electrically. The city
concedes that manual control is jus
tified on certain special occasions.
