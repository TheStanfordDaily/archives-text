# REGISTRATION TOTALS INDICATE INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR'S
## 
### 
Closing time at the Registrar's of- i
fice yesterday showed a total issue
of 3,411 registration books as com- j
pared with the 3,075 books which
had been taken out at the end of
the second day of registration last
year. Of the students who have
taken out books so far, 3,342 have j
completed registration.
The discrepancy of more than 350 j
registrations shown between this j
year's figures is believed to be clue to j
the late registration last year. When
the winter quarter began on Thurs- |
day, many students continued their {
vacations until the following Mon
day, and paid fines for late entrance, j
True comparison with last year's j
figures may not be made until j
Thursday, when all students will j
have been enrolled.
