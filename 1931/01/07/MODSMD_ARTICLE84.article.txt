# RUSSIAN REFUGEES FAIL TO FIND JOBS BY TREK TO CHINA
## 
### 
HARBIN, Manchuria, Jan. 6 (/P)— j
| Refugees from Soviet Russia still j
j stream into Chinese territory despite >
I efforts of Siberian authorities to j
1 keep their nationals inside their!
i own boundaries.
| And more than ever are seeking j
j aid in Manchuria.
With few exceptions, these people j
1 are destitute, possessing barely j
| enough clothing to keep them from I
freezing to death.
Food, they say, doesn't exist in Si- I
beria in large enough quantities to i
keep body and soul together and I
! they are forced to depend on Rus- i
| sian relief societies in Manchurian j
j cities for maintenance.
Once across the border, the ma- I
i jority of the refugees make their j
way to Harbin where they are sure 1
j of at least temporary aid.
Those who have the price or are j
able to borrow it buy passage to j
' Shanghai, Peiping or other cities of j
; China proper, where there is a '
greater likelihood of their obtaining |
I work.
; Work in Harbin is almost impos- j
, sible to find. The city is passing
i through a serious financial depres
sion and thousands of Russians and
• Chinese are faced by a jobless win-
I ter.
The Chinese Eastern railway, the
principal support of .the city, has j
been forced to reduce its personnel j
more than 50 per cent and is lower- j
: ing freight and passenger rates in a j
desperate effort to stimulate busi- ;
: ness.
