## 
### 
DAYTON, Ohio, Jan. (j (/P).â€” *The
army air corps' "flying radio labora- i
tory" bows to progress and is to be !
| dismantled.
A sister ship of the plane in which j
I Lieutenants Albert Hegenberger and i
Lester Maitland flew to Hawaii, it is
to be retired after three years as an
air testing laboratory for airplane ,
j radio equipment.
A new and higher-powered cargo ;
I plane will succeed it. In all its wan- I
derings over most of the country the '
plane has never been in a crash and
but once made a forced landing.
Originally it was a passenger plane :
but the seats were ripped out for ,
long shelves and equipment installed I
to make the first flying radio labor- I
atory.
In this laboratory important radio j
j air developments of the last three
j years have taken place, including j
j two-way communication between !
! plane and ground, initial testing of
! all new radio sets received by the ;
signal corps, and experiments with i
loud speaker communication be
tween plane and ground as well as
a dial system for transmission and !
| reception of code messages.
