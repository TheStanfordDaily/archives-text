### 
Outstanding danger spots in Euro
pean international relations ai'e ill
feeling between Germany and Po
land and strained relations between
Italy and France, according to Pro
fessor Raymond Gettell, head of the
political science department of the
University of California, in a lecture
delivered last evening at the Palo
Alto Woman's Club House.
"The people in Europe do not want
war," Professor Gettell said, "but
there are prophecies that by 1935
one or the other of these situations
may develop. The facts that war
costs money and that there is seri
ous danger of internal revolutions if
any country declares war may be
strong influences toward peace.
"The chief difficulty between
Germany and Poland is over a
Polish seaport. The only way to give
Poland a seaport was to cut through
Germany to the Baltic Sea. How
ever the Germans may disagree
among themselves, they are agreed
that the Polish corridor must go,
and I would be willing to prophesy
that it will go, though not neces
sarily violently.
"The relations between France
and Italy are broader and more fun
damental," Professor Gettell con
tinued. "The naval rivalry between
the two countries for supremacy on
the Mediterx-anean was what broke
down the last naval conference. An
other cause of disagreement is that
Italy has more people and less area
than France. Besides, Italy got noth
ing when the colonies of Germany
were divided up, and she blames
this on France.
"The English situation is a very
discouraging one," Professor Gettell
said. "Her two chief exports have
been coal and cotton. The coal
mines are becoming exhausted, and
the world is now burning oil rather
than coal. As to the cotton, India
and China, her best customers, are
torn by revolutions and anti-foreign
ideas now."
