Recent elcctrical experiments car- I
ried out in connection with the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company's new
Tiger River power line project show
' the important position which Stan
ford's Ryan High Voltage Labora-
I tory holds amongst similar institu- '
! tions in the United States.
California's greatest power prob
lem has always been that of the
transmission, without undue loss, of j
electricity from the mountain re
gions to the coast. The transmis- !
sion of electricity is still in its in
fancy and a great deal of scientific
research is needed in this field. Re
alizing this, the power and electrical |
manufacturing companies of the Pa
cific Coast co-operated in» 1926 to
assist in the building of a laboratory
j for this purpose.
i Stanlord was chosen for the site

because of the presence here of Har
ris J. Ryan, professor of electrical
engineering, and his able staff of
assistants who have attained a
unique position in this field of the
scientific world.
The equipment, which is perhaps
the most complete of any electrical
laboratory, includes six 350 kilowatt,
350,000 volt transformers which are
able to produce a maximum of 2,-
oon.ooo volts.
Since the original structure was
completed, 12 113-foot steel towers
have been erected on the 200 acrcs
of land back of the campus proper
set aside by the University for the
accommodation of the laboratory,
and these have already been suc
cessfully used to conduct experi
ments on conductors, test specimens
and their insulating supports.
