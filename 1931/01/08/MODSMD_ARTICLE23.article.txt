# FRENCH NATION PAYS MARSHAL FINAL TRIBUTE
## Notre Rame Filled As Paris Crowds Line Route Of Joffre Funeral 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 7 (/P) —France, in a
final tribute of love and respect to
the "savior" of Paris, gave Marshal
Joffre today a national funeral,
which in its grandeur reminded of
that "Day of Ashes" when the body
of Napoleon Bonaparte was brought
back from St. Helena.
Tonight the body of the valiant
victor of the Marne lay, like that of
Napoleon, under the great dome of
the Invalides, in a disused sacristy
of the chapel of St. Louis, dedicated
to the old crusader king. It was
placed there so that Madame Joffre
might pray beside her soldier hus
band in silence.
Body to Be Moved
Some months from now the body
will be transferred to "Chestnut
Grove," the marshal's country home,
where it will be entombed in a
mauseleum like that of Washington
at Mt. Vernon.
There was not a foot of standing
room at Notre Dame when the ar
rival of President Doumergue sig
nalled the beginning of the Requiem
Mass, shortened at Joffre's own re
quest. The highest officials of the
government were there in sombre
garb and representatives of many
nations, many of them attending as
the personal representatives of rulers
and sovereigns.
Officials Attend
Outside in the square in front of
the cathedral the cortege formed,
Republican guardsmen in the lead.
On either side of the coffin marched
a company of infantry and behind,
after the marshal's immediate fam
ily, marched the president, members
of the government, and the diplo
matic corps, among the latter Walter
E. Edge, American ambassador.
