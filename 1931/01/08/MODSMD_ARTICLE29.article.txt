# ITALIAN FLYERS LAND IN BRAZIL
## Balbo To Deliver Planes To Government 
### 
NATAL, Brazil, Jun. (A>) —Thou-
sands of natives of this far north
eastern tip of the South American
continent gathered here today to
gaze in amazed admiration at ten
great Italian seaplanes which yester
day flew across the Atlantic to com
plete one of the greatest achieve
ments of aviation history.
Natal, which has seen both dirigi
ble and airplanes arrive from long
over-ocean flights, gave the Italian
air caravan a welcome such as none
of the others ever had. Multitudes
stood out in equatorial rains for
hours to cheer the arrival, which was
heralded by passage of the planes
over Fernando De Noronha. Each
of the planes carried four men.
Party Feted
General Balbo and his companions,
exultant over the so nearly perfect
completion of their hazardous un
dertaking, were taken in a triumphal
automobile procession.
The planes are to be sold to the
Brazilian government, either upon
reaching Bio De Janeiro or upon
their return from Buenos Aires,
should that trip be decided upon.
Their flight is by far the most re
markable mass transoceanic flight,
but is not the first. In 1919 three
American naval flying boats at
tempted to span the Atlantic and one
of the planes, the NC-4 succeeded
in reaching Lisbon after stops in
the Azores. Two army planes equip
ped with pontoons in 1924 flew
around the world in easy stages.
The Italian squadron, numbering
14 planes, left Orbetello, Italy, De
cember 17, a storm dividing them on
their trip to Cartagena. Eiqht planes
reached the Spanish city, while six
were forced down in the Balearic
Isles. They were reunited at Geni
tra, Morocco.
