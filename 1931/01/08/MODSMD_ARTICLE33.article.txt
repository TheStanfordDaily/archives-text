# BUNN TO LEAD INDIAN CAGERS SOUTH TONIGHT
## Stanford Will Clash With U.C.L.A. In Brace Of League Tilts SOUTHERN TEAM GOOD 
### Stewart Crawford 
Coach John W. Bunn and his band
of Cardinals basketeers, carrying
with them the long unfulfilled hopes
of Farm basketball enthusiasts for a
winning cage team, will board the
Lark tonight headed for the south
land to tangle with the strong U.C.-
L.A. Bruin quintet in the coast con
ference opeyer for both outfits. The
teams will meet in two games, Fri
day and Saturday nights.
Since the advent of the new coach
and his "Phog" Allen system, the
court game at Stanford has taken on
new lile, and wonders have already
been worked. However, fans should
not expect too much in this series"
with the powerful Bruin live for sev
eral reasons.
U.C.L.A. (iood
First, the southern institution tlii:;
season seems justified in claiming
that it has the best basketball team
in its conference history. Th(> U.C -
L.A. record to date is marred by only
one defeat, and that at the hands of
the L.A.A.C. team, which is prob
ably the best on the coast.
Besides triumphs over a number
of good southern teams, the Bruins
claim two victories over the Montana
outfit, which Bunn's men downed by
one point Monday night. One of
these wins was by the overwhelming
margin of 30 points.
Tall Men on Team
With the exception of Von Hagen
at forward, the southerners are all
over six feet in height, their tallest
man being Lubin, who jumps center
and then retires to the guard posi
tion. Linthicum, who two years ago
proved his ability in any company,
but was out last year, is back in his
old berth at forward.
Depending entirely on offense, the
Bruins are deadly in shooting, and
pin their hopes on an exceptionally
fast attack to win. For this reason,
Bunn stressed defense in yesterday's
practice, and hopes to present an
airtight combination Friday.
Bunn Plans Offense
This lack of stout defense on the
part of the Bruin live may prove a
decided help to the Indians if their
attack can break swiftly. Bunn is
working on this quick getaway,
which looked greatly improved in
yesterday's workout.
However, since his forwards are
handicapped from a lack of height,
the Cardinal coach may have troublr
in his plan of offense, especially if
the giant Lubin keeps his six fort
five inches between Bunn's forwards
and the bucket.

the giant Lubin keeps his six fort
five inches between Bunn's forwards
and the bucket.
Coach John W. Bunn and his band
of Cardinals basketeers, carrying
with them the long unfulfilled hopes
of Farm basketball enthusiasts for a
winning cage team, will board the
Lark tonight headed for the south
land to tangle with the strong U.C.-
L.A. Bruin quintet in the coast con
ference opeyer for both outfits. The
teams will meet in two games, Fri
day and Saturday nights.
Since the advent of the new coach
and his "Phog" Allen system, the
court game at Stanford has taken on
new lile, and wonders have already
been worked. However, fans should
not expect too much in this series"
with the powerful Bruin live for sev
eral reasons.
U.C.L.A. (iood
First, the southern institution tlii:;
season seems justified in claiming
that it has the best basketball team
in its conference history. Th(> U.C -
L.A. record to date is marred by only
one defeat, and that at the hands of
the L.A.A.C. team, which is prob
ably the best on the coast.
Besides triumphs over a number
of good southern teams, the Bruins
claim two victories over the Montana
outfit, which Bunn's men downed by
one point Monday night. One of
these wins was by the overwhelming
margin of 30 points.
Tall Men on Team
With the exception of Von Hagen
at forward, the southerners are all
over six feet in height, their tallest
man being Lubin, who jumps center
and then retires to the guard posi
tion. Linthicum, who two years ago
proved his ability in any company,
but was out last year, is back in his
old berth at forward.
Depending entirely on offense, the
Bruins are deadly in shooting, and
pin their hopes on an exceptionally
fast attack to win. For this reason,
Bunn stressed defense in yesterday's
practice, and hopes to present an
airtight combination Friday.
Bunn Plans Offense
This lack of stout defense on the
part of the Bruin live may prove a
decided help to the Indians if their
attack can break swiftly. Bunn is
working on this quick getaway,
which looked greatly improved in
yesterday's workout.
However, since his forwards are
handicapped from a lack of height,
the Cardinal coach may have troublr
in his plan of offense, especially if
the giant Lubin keeps his six fort
five inches between Bunn's forwards
and the bucket.
