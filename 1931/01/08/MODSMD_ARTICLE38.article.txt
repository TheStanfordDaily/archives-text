ward li. Rhodes f'ost, \H, 2. (if the American Lotion, Yesterday j
flic post gained a place in 1 Ik* headlines with the proposal that the!
tatc tax football receipts of Washington State ' 'ollege and the I'ni
versity of Washington 25 per cent.
The proposal, which takes the form of a resolution to me ;
morialize the Washington Legislature to pass a hill taxing football |
receipts, declares that football is a commercial proposition and I
should be taxed for the benefit of education.
11 is needless to justify the right of colleges to use all their
ports receipts for their own purposes. I hat right is self-evident, j
I lie practice of charging admission for intercollegiate athletic con- J
tests, football games among them, developed as a means of financing 1
lliese sports activities.
I here was a long period when receipts from this source were j
inadequate to meet bare ever running expenses. Hut. as public in
terest in football has increased, gate receipts have increased, with
the result that expenses of all college sports arc now provided for by
football revenues. Where there have been surpluses, they have
almost always been used to improve the college properties.
Self defeating is the proposal of the Tacoma Legion post, sug
gesting that collegiate football be taxed for the benefit of education, j
The I Diversity of Washington and Washington State College,
being state institutions, are already supported by the state. Why tax !
them for their own benefit?
Tacoma Post Xo. 2 of the \mcrican Legion seems successfully
to have nominated itself as a contributor to the Most I'.rilliant Ideas
of the Month C olumn for 1031.
