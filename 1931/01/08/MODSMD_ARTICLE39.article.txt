# FINES FOR FLUNKS
## 
### 
< irapevine telegraph brings news of the proposal on the part of
a large Mastern university to re(|iiire students to pay a fee of $25 :
for every course they flunk. Whether t proposal embodies a
good idea or not, certainly it is unusual.
The motive is obvious. Too many students fail to take their :
education seriously, but come to college merely to idle and plav and !
flunk. It is believed that $25 a flunk would prove too great a luxury J
for the average undergraduate, and therefore would spur him on
1o passing grades.
Perhaps there might be another by-product of this proposal, if !
adopted. Students worried about the necessity of paying a large j
line for flunking might feel obliged to perfect bigger and better
methods of cribbing. That ancient art would soon attain heights
unprecedented in the history of education.
There is too much compulsion attached to the average university
curriculum as it is. Il is hoped that students may long continue to
enjov the dotitbful freedom of lluuking courses whenever they so
please. j
