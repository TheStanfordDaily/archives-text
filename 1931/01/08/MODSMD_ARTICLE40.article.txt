WHISPERING FRIENDS.—At the |
President Theatre, San Francisco.
Mr. Cohan's play Is not entirely
bad, parts are just dull. There is
supposed to be very little plot (and
quite eorrectly there isn't even a .
vestige of one), but there IS sup- j
posed to be brilliant dialogue ,
bristling with , wit and adroitly
pointed remarks which turns out to
be the dullest dialogue to which any
unsuspecting audience has ever been
subjected. The highly artificial situ
ations were supposed to exist upon
a repartee which in turn was de- j
pendent for its humor upon a gener
ous portion of slang.
Mr. Cohan's recipe for a sure
laugh is to have the leading man j
upon seeing his best friend for the
first time in six months ejaculate:
"How are you, Bill, you old son of a |
gun, you old son of a sea cook, you
old baboon; you look pretty good i
ycu old codger," the which is punc- j
tuated by vigorous back-slapping on j
the part of both leading man and
friend.
Whether the conversation was ba- i
sically romantic or humorous did not j
bother Mr. Cohan, who worked in j
every bit of American slang con- j
sidered as a humdinger between
1911-1918. To Mr. Fillmore, who por- !
trayed the bachelor friend, go the j
laurels of working into his conver- j
sation more "hully gees" to the
square minute than any of the other j
mummers, not even excepting Miss '
Stafford, who, however, made up
for this negligence by artfully flut- |
tering a lace handkerchief from a !
carefully poised digit. —J. D. H. ;
TORCH SONG—At the Alcazar
Theatre, San Francisco.
Mr. Duffy's latest presentation, the ;
"Torch Song," is a strange mixture |

of religion and none-too-proper
wise-cracks. In view of the plot
such a mixture is apparently un
avoidable, but undoubtedly better
stories have been written. The story
deals with several traveling sales
men, a cabaret girl, and the Salva- :
lion Army, so judge for yourself. I
The actors do well with such a
poor start, although there are points
when the audience is inclined to
squirm. Mayo Methot as the cabaret
girl gives an excellent perform
ance; she possesses both talent and
good looks. The rest of the 'cast is
adequate.
"Torch Song" is well staged and
acted, the fault lies in the play
itself. The plot is none too original
and its effect is spoiled by a weak
climax. —N. J.
THE PRINCESS AND THE
PLUMHER—At the Varsity Thea
tre.
'"Ihe Princess" and the Plumber"
is one of those amusing farces that
flow so easily from the pen of Alice
Duer Miller, from whose story it
was adapted. Charles Farrell plays
the lead, a part totally different
from that which he had in "Liliom,"
one which carries a welcome touch
of freshness, a new departure.
Maureen O'Sullivan, whom every
one wili remember from her suc
cess in "Just Imagine," provides an
adequate touch of vivaciousness and ,
princessly coyness.
With a fictitious principality some
where in Europe for the background, r
"The Princess and the Plumber" has
been developed to the fullest possi
bility in beauty and originality of
photography. It is on the whole one
of the best pictures one could find
for a surprising, laughable comedy
among those produced today.
