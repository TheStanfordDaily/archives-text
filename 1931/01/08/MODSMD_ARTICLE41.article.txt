# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Our pedagogical feet are wet, like
the sky and overhead expenses.
Nothing in the world is left dry,
except the paper we print news on,
and the ink spoils even that. It's a
cold, cold world.
The ATO's are planning to start
a service station and repair shop, to
lighten our grief. "Chivalry plus"
will be their motto. They've taken,
to changing tires for poor unfor
tunates in the rain—"Unfortunate"
meaning "not over five-feet-two,
moviesque style (spelled with a
feminine 'e'), smiling eyes, and 4*ny
thing else she has to offer."
And now a history professor
breaks down and announces that
"History does not have to be
true." We never believed what
they told us, anyway; and there
is no Santa Clans.
Tonight the basketball team will
leave for Los Angeles in a blaze of
hope and squeaking air brakes. Of

! course, as a university, we have our
own private ideas about U.C.L.A.
i But if their team is as violent as it
was in the game last year, an ambu
lance may be useful in bringing our
Indians back home. Luck's changed,
though, this year. We wish 'em lots
' of it.
Cabbages finally has to con
fess to you what an awful strain
bis New Year's resolutions are
putting on him. We resolved not
to pun, even well, and there
have been so many things to
pun about, this week. Only the
roommate can tell you bow
we've suffered. Just ask him.
His real name is Schnitzberger,
but we call him "Sinus" be
cause he nose all.
The Maryland Stale Penitentiary
has a class in journalism made up
of eleven ordinary convicts and one
murderer. When they get out,
America will have a dozen more
1 competent column writers.
