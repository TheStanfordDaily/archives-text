APROPOS OF THE BAND

The Editor, Sir:
Lately there has arisen public dis
cussion concerning the band situa
tion in general at this institution.
To many of the students who have
no active interest in music the topic
means nothing; hut to those of us
who like music and enjoy our par
ticipation in it, the subject is of
vital importance.
This school needs a music depart
ment badly. All of the musical or
ganizations here operate individu
ally, having no definite bond. There
lore whatever enterprises are car
ried on by any of the musical bodies
depend for their entire support on
the initiative and ability of the
managers and members of the or
ganization attempting to do some
thing worthwhile. If the musical or
ganizations here were under one
head, many of the difficulties would
be eliminated arid music might be
gin to make some headway.
Contrary to the general opinion,
the factor that has contributed most
to the abominable state of musical
affairs on the campus is not the dis
interest on the part of the faculty
or B.A.C. but is the associated stu
dent body government.
Four years ago this fall Mr. Kul
mann, who has been director of the
Stanford Glee Club for four years,
approached the faculty with the
proposition of uniting the four musi
cal organizations on this campus (the
band, the orchestra, the male glee
club, and the women's glee club)
into a sort of musical department
under the leadership of Mr. Kul
mann. The subject was well con
sidered. Mr. Kulmann was to be
paid a salary of $2500 a year and
the four organizations were going
to pool all of their resources into
a general fund to facilitate the run
ning of the department.
After things had reached this
stage, the matter went to the Asso
ciated Students for consideration,
and after a little discussion, was
turned down. The reason for doing
so was given out to be the fact that
the Associated Students considered
that it would be unfair to those as
sistant managers of the concert
series who were 4ooking forward to
getting the job of managing the fol
lowing to form such an organiza
tion, thus taking the management
out of their hands. I, personally,
can't see the justice of such a stand

|In the first place, as everyone
j knows, (he Concert Series is yearly
i proving to be more and more ol a
I financial failure. Wherein is the jus
i tice of maintaining an ancient in
' stitution that has outlived its use-
I fulness for the benefit of one or two
! students and to the detriment of
about 200 students?
So let's see if we can't drop our
blase and negligent attitude toward
anything that is not to our < wn per
sonal benefit and give some support
to music, thus lending a helpful
hand to the band and this well
known and supposedly enlightened
campus. â€”Everett Baker.
