Julian Huxley, at the University
of McGill, claims that apes are very
human. Could not the self-respect
of the human race be retained and
the same idea expressed by stating
that some humans act like apes?
Scientists of most all brands
delight in classifying mail as a
mere advanced animal. Such a
classification is probably true,
but if man were classified as
man and not as a chimpanzee
(hat came out of the trees, stood
lip on his hind legs, put on
pants, and invented saxaphones
â€”sub-debs would not be so
prone to gurgle, "Oh, I must
express my animal nature."
A student at Baylor University
while lunching at a local "beanery"
found a pearl in his dish of oysters.
If one can find a pearl in oysters,
just think of the infinite possibility
of discovery in hash, meat loaf, stew,
and stuffed bell peppers.
The University of Toronto distin
guishes between flappers and co-eds
in general.
If there is a difference, it con
sists merely in that the flapper
carries around "Liberty" and
the co-ed uses "Vanity Fair";
the former says,"And how!" and
the latted chirps, "I'd f>e de
lighted"; one acts like a dapper
and the other attempts to act
like a ''lady."
The Harvard Crimson publishes
an anonymous confidential guide to
courses and professors at the begin
ning of new semesters.
The Harvard system also acts as a
pointed stimulant to some profes
sors.
