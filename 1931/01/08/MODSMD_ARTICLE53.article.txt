Ten men—five forwards, two cen
ters, and three guards—have been
most active in the Pavilion to date
during the course of various bas
ketball skirmishes with outside
teams. Evidently, it is to these men
that Stanford must look for vic
tories on the court, although a ris
ing star may displace any of them.
At forward. Coach John
Rutin's heart is gladdened by a
ding-dong race between five
promising candidates. Tom
Cordry, Payne Palmer, Phil
Moffatt, "Bud" Hawkins, and
Don Tyler comprise the out
standing luminaries. Hovering
on the outskirts are Reggie
Meade and Virgil Hepp, either
or both of whom are liable to
crash the starting lineup any
day.
Of the first five forwards named,
Cordry and Palmer are mere sopho
mores. Cordry, making up for his
small stature by a world of fire,
started the early games and ex
hibited a keen eye for the basket.
Piilmer, a trifle taller, handles him
self like a finished performer. These
men speak well for the future.
Transferring his attention
from football to basketball. Phil
Moll'att has lost nothing in pro
ficiency. Scoring on shots from
all angles, Phil has been the
most consistent marksman on
the squad. Don Tyler, although
missing from the floor during
the greater part of the practice
games, should prove to be as
flashy as ever later in the sea
son. "Bud" Hawkins, using his
height to good advantage, has
helped the Cardinal cause.
Captain Mike Reynolds, although
not the tallest center in the world,
has been the most dependable man
under the basket. Few men com
pare to the Indian chieftain in re
trieving the ball from the backboard
on defense, while his offensive work
has been good. Bill Doub rounds
out the center duo. Doub has been
more successful to date in hoisting
his avoirdupois from the floor, and
his shooting has been timely.
Moving back into the court,
we find two excellent reasons
for optimism. Vance Fawcett
and Rudy Rintala share the
honors of defense. Fawcett, a
true competitive athlete, will be
the best man on the floor in
many games, but Rintala will
have ,his spectacular moments
as well.
Of these two, Fawcett is probably
the neater workman, while Rintala's
shooting is more dependable. Phil
Baker, the third guard to be con
sidered, has yet to find his shooting
eye. When he does, he will be
doubly dangerous, for his defensive
work leaves little to be desired.
Ten men—two are sophomores,
three are juniors, and five are
seniors. Good material is pres
ent for next year, while this sea
son's outfit is fairly well sprin
kled with veterans. And so.
while California's drubbing of
Montana is none too encourag
ing, Stanford's stock is bound
to rise. —L. K., Jr.

the best man on the floor in
many games, but Rintala will
have ,his spectacular moments
as well.
Of these two, Fawcett is probably
the neater workman, while Rintala's
shooting is more dependable. Phil
Baker, the third guard to be con
sidered, has yet to find his shooting
eye. When he does, he will be
doubly dangerous, for his defensive
work leaves little to be desired.
Ten men—two are sophomores,
three are juniors, and five are
seniors. Good material is pres
ent for next year, while this sea
son's outfit is fairly well sprin
kled with veterans. And so.
while California's drubbing of
Montana is none too encourag
ing, Stanford's stock is bound
to rise. —L. K., Jr.
Ten men—five forwards, two cen
ters, and three guards—have been
most active in the Pavilion to date
during the course of various bas
ketball skirmishes with outside
teams. Evidently, it is to these men
that Stanford must look for vic
tories on the court, although a ris
ing star may displace any of them.
At forward. Coach John
Rutin's heart is gladdened by a
ding-dong race between five
promising candidates. Tom
Cordry, Payne Palmer, Phil
Moffatt, "Bud" Hawkins, and
Don Tyler comprise the out
standing luminaries. Hovering
on the outskirts are Reggie
Meade and Virgil Hepp, either
or both of whom are liable to
crash the starting lineup any
day.
Of the first five forwards named,
Cordry and Palmer are mere sopho
mores. Cordry, making up for his
small stature by a world of fire,
started the early games and ex
hibited a keen eye for the basket.
Piilmer, a trifle taller, handles him
self like a finished performer. These
men speak well for the future.
Transferring his attention
from football to basketball. Phil
Moll'att has lost nothing in pro
ficiency. Scoring on shots from
all angles, Phil has been the
most consistent marksman on
the squad. Don Tyler, although
missing from the floor during
the greater part of the practice
games, should prove to be as
flashy as ever later in the sea
son. "Bud" Hawkins, using his
height to good advantage, has
helped the Cardinal cause.
Captain Mike Reynolds, although
not the tallest center in the world,
has been the most dependable man
under the basket. Few men com
pare to the Indian chieftain in re
trieving the ball from the backboard
on defense, while his offensive work
has been good. Bill Doub rounds
out the center duo. Doub has been
more successful to date in hoisting
his avoirdupois from the floor, and
his shooting has been timely.
Moving back into the court,
we find two excellent reasons
for optimism. Vance Fawcett
and Rudy Rintala share the
honors of defense. Fawcett, a
true competitive athlete, will be
the best man on the floor in
many games, but Rintala will
have ,his spectacular moments
as well.
Of these two, Fawcett is probably
the neater workman, while Rintala's
shooting is more dependable. Phil
