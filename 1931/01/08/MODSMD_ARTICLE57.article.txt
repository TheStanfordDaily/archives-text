# Frosh Cagers Work Out With Varsity Men
## POOR GOAL SHOTS FEATURE PLAY IN PRACTICE TUSSLE Bunn Changes Lineup For Scrimmage; Bradshaw May Handle Team 
### Jack Jernegan 
Still competition in the form of a
quintet of the varsity reserve play
ers was called in by Coach John
Bunn yesterday to give his fresh- !
man basketball men some hard
work and help him straighten out
the kinks in the babe machine.
Tlie yearling first string put in a
good half hour of strenuous activity
in a rough scrimmage with the var
sity men, and then gave way to the
reserve quintet.
Shooting Poor
Despite the experience of their
opponents, the babes played on
practically even terms throughout
the session, at least in so far as lloor
work is concerned. When it came to
shooting, however, the frosn seemed
utterly unable to locate the basket. '
No one of the five l~md any success
whatever in sinking his goal shots, i
and if this weakness is not reme
died it is likely to cause plenty of
grief Saturday when they run up
against the San Francisco Univer
sity freshmen here. >,
" Lineup Shifted
Coach Bunn made some shifts in
the first team lineup for the scrim
mage yesterday, putting Panero in
at forward in place of Saxe and ,
Herb Holm in Smith's post at left
guard. Panero tied for high-point
honors in the Ukiah game Monday
and probably earned a promotion by
his work in that contest. Holm is one
of the larger men on the squad,
which should benefit by the added
height.
Uncertainty as to the condition of
Jim Mears' injured ankle makes the
question of who will handle the
freshmen Saturday in the absence
of Bunn still undecided. If 'Mears
is able to make the trip south with j
the varsity squad Jimmy Bradshaw
will probably be the man in charge
on the frosh bench.
