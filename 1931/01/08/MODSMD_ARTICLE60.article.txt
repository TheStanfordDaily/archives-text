# A 						KNIGHT OF THE PINE SAUCER
## New Jersey Cyclist Has Fine Record in Six-Day Bike Races; Twice Winner of Championship 
### Feg Murray 
There are so many Belonis, Georg- [
ettis, Brocardos, Buschenhagens, j
Linaris, Richelis, and Debaetses in !
every six-day bike race that it is a
i pleasure to find a plain American
name on the program. Such a one |
is Fred Spencer, former bicycle 1
| champion of America, and a 27-
year-old lad from Plainfield, New
Jersey.
The mad, dizzy whirl known as !
the six-day bike race is staged in :
Madison Square Garden, New York, i
and a dozen or more teams of two j
intrepid riders each are whirling
around the pine saucer in the late I
Tex Rickard's Temple of Sports in j
a seemingly never-ending grind j
j that leads nowhere except to cash i

! and glory, or arnica and defeat.
Fred Spencer won the New York
| six-day race in March, 1925, paired
with Walthour; was third in the
December grind paired with Wal
i thour; seventh in March, 1926, with
I Benezatto; second a year later with
Walthour; won in December 1927
with Winter; was last in March 1923
with Walthour; first in December of
! that year with Georgetti; and sev
enth in March 1929 with Horder. He
| also won the October 1925 grind in
' Chicago, paired with Walthour, and
j finished second in several other
Windy City whirls. He is a product
| of New Jersey, the state which has
j produced so many great bike riders,
land has won at least two U.S.
i cycling championships.
