### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7 (/P)â€”
Ira B. Cross, professor of economics
at the University of California, told
500 members of the Pacific Coast
Electrical Bureau at a dinner here
last night that increasing the pay of
wage earners would speed a return
to normal conditions.
"With the wage earners lies the
great buying power of the country,"
Cross said. "We have had depres
sions before and have always come
out on top. By July you will see we
arc on the road to recovery. People
are tired of being depressed and arc
beginning to spend money again.
This will bring prosperity."
