# LINES OF EASTERN RAILROAD SYSTEMS IN PROPOSED MERGER
## 
### 




A proposal to consolidate eastern railways into four major systems has been agreed upon by railway executives. Announcement of the
agreement was made by President Hoover. The four major groups in the plin are the New York Central, the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore
and Ohio and the Chesapeake and Ohio, which, with the Nickel Plate, is the Van Sweringen system. In the consolidation the New York
Central gets the Lackawanna; the Pennsylvania retains control of the Wabash and the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton; the Baltimore and Ohio
gets the Reading and the Central of New Jersey, and the Van Sweringen system will add the Lehigh Valley and possibly the Pittsburgh and
West Virginia and the Western Maryland. The Van Sweringens already control the Wheeling and Lake Erie. Maps above show makeup of
the four systems under the proposed consolidation.
