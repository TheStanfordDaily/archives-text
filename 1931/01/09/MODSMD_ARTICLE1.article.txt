# STANFORD GIRL OFFERS BLOOD, SAVES WOMAN
## Patty Baker, Polio Patient, Sacrifices Life Fluid For Injection OPERATION A SUCCESS 
### 
Patty Baker, '32, in the Palo Alto
hospital recovering from an attack
of poliomyelitis which brought her
perilously near death three months
ago, on Tuesday night gave a pint
of her own blood to save the life
of Mrs. A. A. Tucker of Redwood
City, an expectant mother who was
brought into the hospital Sunday
stricken with the same malady, it
was revealed yesterday by the
physician who performed the injec
tion.
Miss Baker, upon learning that
Mrs. Tucker's only chance for life
was an immediate blood injection,
courageously and without hesitation
offered to give her blood, which, in
her convalescent condition, had the
effect of an antitoxin serum.
Disregarding the warning of her
doctor that the loss of blood would
imperil her own condition and delay
her recovery, Miss Baker now faces
the prospect of further prolonged
confinement in the hospital. Dr.
Harold J. Beaver performed the in
jection.
Mrs. Tucker is expected to re
cover as a result of the blood in
jection, and Miss Baker, a member
of Chi Omega, registered from Win
ters, California, is progressing satis
factorily.
