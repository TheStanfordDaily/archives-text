NEW YORK. Jan. 8. (A*)â€” Paul M.
Warburg, international banker, pre
dicted today that "a few years
hence the level at which some of
our securities sell today will look
as incomprehensibly low as the
prices paid for the same securities
seemed unreasonably high long be
fore the crash occurred in October
1929."
