# Universities Of Europe Desire Dormitory Plan
## 
### 
That the European universities are |
now attempting to house all of their
students in dormitories was the ob- '
servation made by John A. Sellards, |
dean of the Summer Session, who
has recently returned from a quar- j
ter's leave spent in Europe visiting
universities and professors.
Formerly, he said, those who were :
studying in large cities would live
in boarding houses near the location 1
of the university, but under this new I
system living groups will be pro
vided for a majority of the students. |
In the Cite Universite in France liv
ing groups arc being provided for
students from each country, and in
Spain one of the finest doemitories !
in the world is about to be con- j
structed.

Although he was on vacation, Dean
Sellards spent a good deal of his
tiipe interviewing professors who
will come here for the Summer
Quarter this year and next year. It
has been the custom to engage a cer
tain number of European professors
to come each summer as a part of the
exchange system of instruction. The
names of those who will be here next
year will be passed on by the Stan
ford Board next week and will be
announced then.
While he was in Europe, Dean Sel
lards spent a large part of his time
studying the universities in France,
Germany, and Spain. He also trav
eled in England, Belgium, and Hol
land.
