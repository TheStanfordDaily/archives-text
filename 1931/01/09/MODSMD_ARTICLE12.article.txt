# HOOVER VISIONS NEW AMERICAN IN FEW YEARS
## Says Hope Lies In Youth Trained To Cope With Complex Life 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (/P) —Presi-
dent Hoover believes that ten years
i hence a new generation of Ameri
; cans will begin to arise, endowed
with the mental, moral and physical
i health necessary to cope with the
! complexities of life among the mar
j vels of science.
In an interview, the President told
a writer for Cosmopolitan magazine:
Depend on Children
"Only children of a new genera-
I tion—a new American —can stand
; against this future world.
j "One of the biggest of all problems
| is to drive in this idea of the neces
| sity of properly born, trained, edu
i cated and healthy moraf children to
| the voters and officials of America,
i This child health conference was a
; start —but only that. We must keep
jit alive and burning.
j "We must follow this national con
| ference with a series of state con
| ferences, then group and finally in
! dividual town and city conferences,
j and the 'charter for children' must
j be drawn into the activities of gov
j ernment and social institutions.
"Think what this new generation,
i built upon that constitution, will
| mean to the single problem of the
i young criminal. The present rate of
I criminal increase is disheartening
1 beyond measure.
Health Comes First
"This new generation of children,
healthy, trained and mentally in
spired would go a long way toward
solving all this. Most of our native
criminal class are products of city
slums. If the character and quality
and health of these children were
watched and nurtured, a criminal
type of child would not develop. It
would be difficult to overestimate
what the single item of adequate
playground facilities would mean in
the bringing-up of normal city chil
dren."
Regarding standardization, the ar
ticle quoted the President:
"I don't mind how much we stand
ardize or what we standardize so
long as everybody gets it and uses
it. The purpose of standardizing is
to make things cost less and make
them accessible to everybody. It's
all right to standardize so long as we
standardize up and not down."
