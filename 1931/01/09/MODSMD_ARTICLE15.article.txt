yATICAN CITY, Jan. 8. (TP) —Birth control, trial marriage, and divorce
I were scathingly condemned today in an encyclical of Pope Pius XI
j reaffirming the Catholic doctrine of the sanctity of matrimony. It was
the first such expression of the Holy See on the theme in 50 years. The
i encyclical, containing 16,000 words, drew upon the full sources of ecclc
' siastical authority for its precepts, which, mandatory on the faithful, the

said he hoped to see accepted
by all men. He expressed himself
as follows:
Birth Control—Those practicing
birth control the Pontiff described
as "branded with the guilt of a grave
crime." Abortion is termed "mur
der."
1 Marriage Permanent
Divorce—The age-old Catholic
docti ine of the indissolubility of
marriage for any reason whatsoever
I is reaffirmed.
Companionate Marriage—Experi
mental marriage of any sort the
Pontiff utterly condemns.
Marriage—lts sacred, permanent
character is reaffirmed by the Holy
i Father, who lists its blessings as
children, conjugal fidelity, and hon
i orable obedience to matrimonial ob-
I ligations.
Women Should Obey
Modern Woman —She owes obedi
ence to her husband but not at the
' sacrifice of dignity or to the "point
' of obeying unreasonable requests.
' Sex Education—The Vatican con
' , demns "exaggerated physiological
' I education" although maintaining
, that the basis of happy or unhappy
married life is laid in preparation
1 ! during youth for matrimony.
Sterilization—No human agency
' has the right, the Pontiff declares,
: to impair or destroy the generative
function of the body.. He advised,
1 • however, that persons to whom
; | sterilization would be applicable not
i be married.
