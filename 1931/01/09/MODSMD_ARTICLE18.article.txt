# New Dry Rule Reduces Fines On Violations
## Oregon Congressman Will Ask Night Sessions 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 UP)—Con
gress passed the Stobbs bill to mod
ify the Jones "5 and 10" dry law to
day and that was about the sum
total of agreement on Capitol Hill.
The Jones law modification, upon
which the House acted today, would
define casual violators under the
stringent five-and-ten statute. If ap
proved by the President it would set
up a category of offenses involving
less than one gallon of liquor and
provide a maximum penalty of $500
fine and six months in prison for a
first offense, rather than the five
year and $10,000 penalty.
Senate Argues Loan
The $15,000,000 loan for human
food was virtually in the same po
sition in the house that it occupied
yesterday. The Senate spent most of
its time arguing over the proposed
reconsideration of Commissioners
Smith, Garsaud and Draper, of the
power commission.
Concerned with the snail-like
progress of legislation in the Senate,
the assistant Republican leader, Mc-
Nary of Oregon, informed his col
leagues he was prepared to ask for
night sessions three days a week,
beginning Monday.
Shoals Faces Veto
Muscle Shoals is out of conference
but its troubles are not yet over. It
may pass the House but even then
it faces the possibility of a Presi
dential veto.
Congress, feeling it has enough
trouble on its hands, has made an
effort to delay submission of the
much discussed prohibition report of
the law enforcement commission.
The attempt failed. The commission
is understood to be ready to tell the
President the result of its dry law
studies and he is expected to trans
mit the report to Congress.
