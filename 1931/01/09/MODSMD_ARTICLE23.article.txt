## 
### 
! WASHINGTON, Jan. 8. (/P)â€”Sen
j ate World Court foes have told
j Frank B. Kellogg, a justice on the
I Court, enough votes were in pros
; pect to defeat ratification of Ameri
j can adherence.
This much became known of the
conversations indulged in by Kel
logg during his call today in the
j Senate, where he served formerly
| as a member from Minnesota. The
I white-haired jurist and former Sec-
I retary of State asserted, however,
1 that his call was purely a personal
i one. He denied that he had any
I purpose of discussing the World
j Court issue.
