# Electrical Laboratory Installs New Equipment
## 
### 
Installation in the Stanford elec
trical engineering machinery labora
tory of an increased power supply
and new modern equipment which
will rival any in the United States
has been recently completed, an
nounced Theodore H. Morgan, as
sistant professor of electrical engi
neering.
The now equipment consists of a
set of four General Electric ma
chines, two of direct current and two
of alternating current design. They
may be operated either as genera
tors, supplying power to the labora
tory, or as motors, driving laboratory
apparatus.
The four machines are placed in
line, and n ay be used singly or.
with the aid of flexible couplings,

i may be run in groups.
The two direct current machines
operate at a potential of 125 volts
and can be connected either in se
ries or in parallel. The alternating
current machines are used at 220
I volts when connected for the normal
! three-phase operation. They may
j also, however, be connected for
j single, two, four, six or 12 phases.
Together with the machines a new
! set of transformers which reduce the
| incoming voltage from 4,000 to 220
I have been installed in an adjoining
| room. A modern switchboard which
j is equipped with automatic voltage
! regulators, designed to hold the volt
! age constant, has also been included
to accommodate the new and old
machines of the laboratory,
Power* from the central genera
tors is transmitted to a new ex
change circuit board from which
power is directed by an elaborate
underground wiring system to all
parts of the laboratory. One line,
carrying a direct current of 250 volts,
is sent to the mechanical engineering
department, supplying it with power
for the operation of a dynamometer.
The laboratory facilities were in
creased to enable the department of
electrical engineering to offer in
struction under actual working con
ditions to engineering students who
may be either within or outside of
the electrical department. Thus the
department's courses 102 and 103,
electricity in engineering, required
of all engineering students, for which
only laboratory demonstration was
formerly available, will now be given
on an experimental basis.
University electricians, under the
direction of James W. McDonnell,
assistant superintendent of buildings
and grounds, have been working
since last June on the project.

formerly available, will now be given
on an experimental basis.

Installation in the Stanford elec
trical engineering machinery labora
tory of an increased power supply
and new modern equipment which
will rival any in the United States
has been recently completed, an
nounced Theodore H. Morgan, as
sistant professor of electrical engi
neering.
The now equipment consists of a
set of four General Electric ma
chines, two of direct current and two
of alternating current design. They
may be operated either as genera
tors, supplying power to the labora
tory, or as motors, driving laboratory
apparatus.
The four machines are placed in
line, and n ay be used singly or.
with the aid of flexible couplings,

i may be run in groups.
The two direct current machines
operate at a potential of 125 volts
and can be connected either in se
ries or in parallel. The alternating
current machines are used at 220
I volts when connected for the normal
! three-phase operation. They may
j also, however, be connected for
j single, two, four, six or 12 phases.
Together with the machines a new
! set of transformers which reduce the
| incoming voltage from 4,000 to 220
I have been installed in an adjoining
| room. A modern switchboard which
j is equipped with automatic voltage
! regulators, designed to hold the volt
