# STATES CONFER ON HOOVER DAM
## Defense Declares Dam Is Federal Building 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (/P) â€”'The
stales made defendants in Arizona's
Supreme Court suit to prevent con
struction of Hoover Dam have ten
tatively decided upon the course of
action they will follow in contesting
the action.
They each will lilc answers under
the tentative plan contending they
are not parties to construction of the
dam, believing that if they are up
held the case will be thrown out of
court. They will assert the dam is
being constructed by the Federal
Government.
If this fails, the states then will
combine in an assertion that Ari
zona has shown no cause of action
that calls for relief.
This course has been mapped out
at conferences by representatives of
the defendant states with the So
licitor General of the United States.
Senator Pitlman, Democrat, Nevada,
who represented the Attorney Gen
eral of his state, made the plan pub
lic.
