# EPIDEMICS SHOWN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BIRTH REPORTS
## 
### 
New light was cast on world birth
rates in two papers read by Harold
Hotelling, associate professor of
mathematics, before meetings of the
American Statistical Society and
sections of the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Science
at the recent convention in Cleve
land.
In a paper entitled "Causes of
Birth Rate Fluctuations," written in
collaboration with Mrs. Hotelling,
epidemics were shown to be more
effective than either economic con
ditions or postponement of marriage
age in causing variations in the
birth rate. England's birth rate has
a seven- to nine-month lag follow
ing a sudden epidemic.
In a second paper, called "Recent
Improvements in Statistical Infer
ences," Professor Hotelling offered
a mathematical figure to the statisti
cians, which if solved, would make
evident the cycle of birth, marriages,
and business variations in a given
country.
