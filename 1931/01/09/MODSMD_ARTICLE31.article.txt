# INDIANS OUT TO SCALP FAVORED BRUIN QUINTET
## Coach Bunn Pins Hopes On Airtight Defense To Stop Ucla Five THIRTEEN TAKEN SOUTH 
### Jack Jernegan 
Thirteen determined young Stan
ford men and one not too pessimistic
| basketball coach arc moving into Los
Angeles this morning with the
avowed intention of putting some
i thing over on one of that city's most
highly considered hoop aggregations,
1 namely, the University of California
at Los Angeles.
Underdogs in the advance dope,
the long-suffering Cardinals and
their coach are looking for blood in
their first Coast Conference contests
tonight and tomorrow night and have
the advantage of the underdog psy
chology, together with an offense and
defense of sufficient strength to make
! many observers give the Redskins
an even chance to come through.
Final Workout
Following a final workout here
yesterday afternoon Coach John
Bunn announced the squad which he
I took south with him, gave out a ten
tative starting lineup, and made a
few statements which do not sound
like the remarks of a coach who
thinks he is leading his team out to
defeat.
'"We arc going down there to win
i two ball games, and I am taking
only the men whom I am likely to
need. This is not a sight-seeing
j trip," thus Coach Bunn.
"I have not seen U.C.L.A., although
I have had them scouted, so I can't
venture a prediction, but we will
! make a real game out of it at any
rate. Coach Caddy Works (of U.C.
L.A.) says that ho will let any team
get 40 points on his squad so long
as he can make 50 points on them.
We have been working all week to
perfect an air-tight defense and if
U.C.L.A. can get 50 points through
it we don't deserve to win."
Thirteen Leave
The following are the 13 men who
; comprise the squad which went
south: Forwards, Moffatt, Hawkins,
Cordry, Tyler, Kelly and Palmer;
centers, Reynolds and Doub; guards,
Fawcctt, Rintala, Baker, Tway, and
Hancock.
Rintala and Fawcett will start to
night at guard, Reynolds at centcr
and Moffatt at one forward position.
When he left last night Bunn had
not made up his mind about the
1 other forward place. Palmer was
considered the most probable choice,
but Hawkins, Cordry and Tyler are
other possibilities to take the floor
against the Bruins.
