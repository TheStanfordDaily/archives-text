NEW YORK, Jail. 8. M>)â€”A series
of what their communist sponsors
called "hunger marches" culminated
today in disorders near Salvation
Army headquarters in Brooklyn in
which seven or eight alleged Com
munists were injured and two de
tectives scratched and kicked.
After marching to Borough Hall,
where spokesmen denounced city
and national governments and de
manded free food, clothing, rent,
and heat, the paraders moved toward
Salvation Army headquarters, which
police said they intended to enter.
Forbidden to approach the doors
of the building, they hissed mounted
and foot policc who had b*< n
rushed to the scene to preserve
order. A melee soon started in which
police charged the crowd, dispersing
it after a fifteen-minute fight.
