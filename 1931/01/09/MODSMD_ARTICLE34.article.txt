Xotre Drime's traveling football teams are again possessors of
the Albert Rnssell Krskine Trophy, emblematic of the national foot
ball championship: and Knute Rockne, as coach of the team, or
teams, is the proud owner of a new automobile and a scroll which
says that he has set up the "noble ideal of victory with honor."
In acknowledging the award, Rockne declared : "Some people
may say this award constitutes over-emphasis of football. I think
not. It does not seem to me that because a man is keen, intelligent,
and able on the tootball field that he must be dull in the classroom
any more than because a man is keen in the classroom be will be
dull on the football field."'
Kockne's remarks appeared in the press yesterday along with
the report from ( olumbia that football players there form one of
the dumbest groups scholastically in the universitv. A San Fran
cisco sports writer pointed out that Columbia football men of recent
years have never been famous for their mental alertness and that
it is unfair to score all college athletes as dumb on the evidence
lottnd on Columbia's gridiron.
Rockne and the San Francisco sports critic are right. Achieve
ment in athletics and in academic work can well go hand in hand.
I ootball intelligence is no indication of classroom dullness; verv
often it i> evidence of a mental ability that means success in scho
lastic work. In this regard. Stanford can boast that for the last
four years there has been at least one regular on the varsitv foot
ball team who has also been a member of I'hi l»cta Kappa. Louis
