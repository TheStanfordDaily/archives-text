now and during this short period ii has tended more and more to
encourage the spirit of internationalism and at the same time
strengthen its national organization. It has leaned more and more
to theoretical and impractical roundtables discussion of problems
facing the institutions of higher learning. Instead of developing
ilself as "campus problem clearing house," the X.S.I'.A. has made
plans with student organizations in other countries for exchange of
students and ideas and methods.
The federation's future is unlimited if it should change its
present policy and devote more energy to consideration of Ameri
can caippus problems. If such an organization should continue to
disregard, as unimportant, these local issues, it will have difficult
times striving to exist. Some effort should be made to realize the
value of home problems and issues, other than extensive development
of internationalism, as at present.
