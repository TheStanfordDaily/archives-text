TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. By Louis
Bromfield.
This is the latest product from the
pen of a leading American novelist.
I More than two years in the making,
it is better even than "Early Au
tumn," the book which brought
Bromfield the Pulitzer Prize in 1926.
I Like his "A Good Woman" and"The
Green Bay Tree," it tries to re-cre
ate the essence of people in this pe
culiar day and age. It does.
"Twenty-four Hours" begins at an
exclusive Sutton Place (New York
City) dinner one evening and ends
at a Murray Hall tea the following
! day. This is nothing exciting in it
i self, but what happens in between
the two affairs is well worth read
ing. Through the 462 pages people
j of the modern era march, people like
j David Melbourne, a different kind of
self-made captain of industry; Fanny
j Towner, Melbourn's weak and selfish
I mistress; Jim Towner, her husband,
■ rich and fashionable, and whose
i mistress in turn is Rosa Uugan, night
club singer with a newly-discovered
gunman husband, Dago Tony Bruz
zi, on the side. The book, thus badly
reviewed, sounds like canned hash,
but actually reads like pre-war stuff
to a drinker. It is satisfying and it
does not leave a taste in one's mouth
the morning after the night before.
Only a pleasant feeling.
Take this for whatever it may be
worth. "This novel has never been
submitted to any book club."—W.R.
j THE SHYSTER—At the Geary
Theatre, San Francisco.
Excellent interpretations by sev-
I eral members of the cast make "The
I Shyster," comedy-drama now on the
■ boards at the Geary Theatre, inter
esting in spite of a rather weak plot
! that with poor handling could be
dull.
I Harry Green fans will not be dis
: appointed with his performance as a
young lawyer who first struggles
! desperately to stay t out of the shys
! ter class, and then struggles even
i more desperately to keep the wolf
; away by chasing ambulances and
haunting court rooms.

| Thomas Jackson is another screen
: luminary in the cast, being splendid
| as the leader of a group of gentle
man yeggs. You may remember him
ias the "different" detective of
! "Broadway."
Willette Morris is excellent in the
difficult role of Stella Brian, secre
; tary to Green, not over-playing an
| emotional part.
The story concerns a yodth, played
i by Don Gallaher, who is trapped by
j Jackson into selling some stolen
; bonds to the-aunt of Green's secre
tary, to whom he is engaged. In
i attempting to recover the money,
Gallaher kills Jackson.
In spite of an affection for the girl
' himself, Green secures Gallaher's
| acq&ittal, at the same time estab
i lishing himself as a criminal lawyer.

' LOST SHEEP—At the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.
Leon Errol stumbles through three
i acts of cerise parlor drama, and his
j audience howls for more. His trick
I knee is in better wobbling condition
' than usual, and his British accent
becoming—jolly, ah, topping, quite!
I The lost sheep concerned are a
Methodist minister, one Mr. Wam
' pus, and his family, who are trans
planted from their usual surround
-1 ings to a house troubled by strange
! visitors and inexplicable phone calls.
Mrs. Wampus, in a "Spanish ome
lette dress." decides that their trou
. bles represent their sins, coming
home to roost," but everything ex
cept the hilarity of the play takes
j a turn toward the sober right, and
■we continue to laugh. Even the
minor young love theme succeeds in
1 amusing.
I Half the audience mistook Wylie
Watson for Errol, at first—so he is
good. May Beatty lives up to her
long established title of queen of
1 comedy; and Phyllis Coghlan
achieves something in being the
most convincingly disagreeable char
: acter we've ever seen portrayed by
\ a woman. Lorna Balfour plays a
beautiful seventeen-year-old part,
with just the proper mixture of dig
i nity and fireworks. —M. L. J.
