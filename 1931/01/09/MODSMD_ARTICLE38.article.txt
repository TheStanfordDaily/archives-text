I Now that classes are well under
way, the Indians are on their way
to would-be victory in the South,
: and the calendar approaches the
i tenth of January, the campus begins
; concentrating on women's rushing.
! (Men's, of course, is continuous.)
Not what a sorority is worth to
an individual, but what people
i think it ought to be to an indi
-1 vidual, appears to be an established
j method of choice. Our kingdom for
a change, and a bit of intelligent
thought!
But since there has to be some
formality of choice, rushing will go
on, and roughs will stand around
I on street corners waiting for news.
It is rumored that one sorority has
I lost its carefully planned list of
! menus with which it has been chok
ing rushees into submission for the
last twenty-nine years. And terror
i reigns. Anyhow, if they don't get

| much of a class, there 11 be some
thing tangible to blame it on!
Meanwhile, we have some
suggestions for new women who
want to make a real impression.
1..1t is generally considered best
| not to whistle at table.
2. Napkins are being worn under
the chin, this Spring.
3. Rushees should not when
at dinner keep up a running
conversation with the mashers.
4. Leaving any food on the plate
is considered an insult. All signs of
i excess nourishment should be care
fully wiped off the plate with a
piece of bread. It saves time in the
j kitchen. (Frosh men are advised to
clip that, and save it till Spring
quarter.)
5. Kissing one's hostess good
bye is now obsolete. But go
ahead and try it anyway, if you
feel like it. Be natural—after all,
i that's the thing that counts.
