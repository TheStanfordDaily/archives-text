In hope or in despair the editor of
the Washington State Daily asks:
"What is the student's mind"
Who cares?
Havcrford College gave an ex
amination containing 2,725 ques
tions.
Did not somebody say at
sometime in someplace that fools
could ask questions that wise
men could not answer?
At Ohio Wesleyan 400 freshmen
and sophomore women staged a
brawl to determine whether or not
the frosh would wear berets.
Women evidently are becoming
emancipated from the restraints that
once bound them.
The fact that the University of
Pittsburgh is to occupy a 42-story
skyscraper is not, particularly im
portant; but its significance is vital.
Modern universities have drifted
far from Plato's Academy where the
students wandered with the "profes
sor" in happy bliss and contentment
among the olive treesâ€”thrilling to
new ideas under azure skies.
U.S.C. will give compulsory
courses in swimming to their
Women students. One might {(re
sume that is so they can "walk
home" from yachting parties.
