# HARRY J. RATHBUN STANFORD DELEGATE TO LAW CONVENTION
## 
### 
Stanford was well represented at
the cross-road of conventions dur
ing the holidays, according to Harry
J. Ratbbun, associate professor of
law, who was within ear-shot of fifty
or more national conventions dur
ing his recent two weeks' trip to
Cleveland and Chicago.
Rathbun was Stanford's delegate
to a gathering of teachers of busi
ness law, who met as part of the
convention of the American Eco
nomic Association in Cleveland.
"Three years of law are too cum
bersome fot* the business student.
Yet he must have a survey of law
to recognize the problems in which
business involves him," said Rath
bun.
"The convention questioned
whether such law taught from the
standpoint of the business man, t
lather' than the lawyer, should be
included in law or business school.
At Stanford we associate it with the !
law school."
In Chicago Rathbun attended the
convention of the Association of |
American Law Schools, to which '
Stanford had sent two delegates, j
and in Cleveland listened to discus- ,
sions of various sociological, econo- ;
mic, and scientific societies, among i
them the American Association for >
the Advancement of Science.
