### Darrell Amyx SUPPRESSED DESIRE 
I'd love to be a mountaineer
(A wish now grown quite ripe)—?
I'd love to be a mountaineer,
And smoke a corn-cob pipe.
I'd love to be a mountaineer
Named Seth (or is it Seeth-) —
I'd love to be a mountaineer,
And spit between my teeth.
I'd love to be a mountaineer
And drool tobacco juice—
But there isn't any mountain near,
So what the hell's the use?
