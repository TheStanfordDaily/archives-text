# SIDELINE SLANTS
## MUTTERING 
### 
One year ago, a Stanford basket
brill team fared forth to the wilds
of Westwood to beard the Bruin in
his lair. But a grievious plague fell
upon the band of Indians, and dis
aster smote them hip and thigh.
When the carnage had ceased, the
scoreboard of the Bruins read
U.C.L.A. 63, Stanford 30.
Bitter cold that winter was,
with ice encrusted about the
warm heats of the Indian clan
at every casaba ceremony. I*ut
twice were the Stanford stal
warts successful in their quest
for the palms of victory—once
they wrangled a win from the
Bruins, another auspicious eve
ning saw the Terrible Trojans
trounced: a
Alas, tears are torn from the fol
lowers of the Cardinal at the mere
whisper of California. Black magic,
or some similar sombre shadow east
its spell over the figures of the In
dian five, and . naught prevailed
against the sinister, slinking sons of
Berkeley iji three fruitless engage
ments.
But behold! From far Kansas
a coach came forth. What is his
destiny? Time, shrouding the
future in mystery, parts her cur
tains to permit a peek /it the
future, it) southern California
tonight and tomorrow night
much will be revealed upon the
basketball court. Who can say
what sorrow or surprise events
upon the hardwood will bring?
Five of the nine Conference com
bats will be staged within the por
tals of the Pavilion before the sea
son has slipped away—four en
counters will be fought on foreign
fields. Fate and the schedule-makers
have decreed the sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red be given
an opportunity to watch the ma
jority of the cage meetings.
A win in one of the two tests
with the Westwood warriors
would give the Cardinals a
chance. Two defeats spell addi
tional sorrow for Stanford. Vic
tory and visions of success will
flock before the Indian eyes: de
feat brings a dirge to our lips.
What will the week-end bring?
Much has been said on basket
ball; much remains to be seen. For
Stanford, for Bunn, for the basket
ball team itself, tonight and tomor
row mean almost everything. Hope
foi the future will always be pres
ent on the Farm —another season
means a new opportunity—but what
of the present?
Come what may, the new
regime has made a noticeable
improvement in Stanford's cage
play. A confidence in the ability
of the cagers has arisen; the
campus feels that the outfit is
capable of winning games in
1931. Given a modicum of the
breaks, and the Indians w ill find
a place in the hoop heavens.
One guess is as good as another—
we have nothing to base our belief
upon, but we feel that the student
body will be proud of the quintet
representing it before many days
have passed. Yes, sir—we wouldn't
be surprised to see Stanford win
( nee at least from the Bruins.

have decreed the sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red be given
an opportunity to watch the ma
jority of the cage meetings.
A win in one of the two tests
with the Westwood warriors
would give the Cardinals a
chance. Two defeats spell addi
tional sorrow for Stanford. Vic
tory and visions of success will
flock before the Indian eyes: de
feat brings a dirge to our lips.
What will the week-end bring?
Much has been said on basket
ball; much remains to be seen. For
Stanford, for Bunn, for the basket
ball team itself, tonight and tomor
row mean almost everything. Hope
foi the future will always be pres
ent on the Farm —another season
means a new opportunity—but what
of the present?
Come what may, the new
regime has made a noticeable
improvement in Stanford's cage
play. A confidence in the ability
of the cagers has arisen; the
campus feels that the outfit is
capable of winning games in
1931. Given a modicum of the
breaks, and the Indians w ill find
a place in the hoop heavens.
One guess is as good as another—
we have nothing to base our belief
upon, but we feel that the student
body will be proud of the quintet
representing it before many days
have passed. Yes, sir—we wouldn't
be surprised to see Stanford win
