A truck loaded with dirt was
overturned when the vehicle's wheels
became deeply mired yesterday
morning by the bi-county bridge
connecting the Stanford campus with
the Portola road. The accident oc
curred when a portion of the ap
proach to the bridge on the Santa
Clara county side of the bridge caved
in under the weight of the load.
