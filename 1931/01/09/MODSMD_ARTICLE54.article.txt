# Banner Year Looms For Freshmen Tracksters
## YEARLINGS APPEAR STRONG IN WEIGHT EVENTS, HURDLES Younger Brother Of Late Ward Edmonds Has Fine Prep Marks 
### F.V. Lloyd 
Prospects for a successful fresh
man (lack season appeared brighter j
today by the addition to the roster j
of Arthur Meiers, star hurdler and
high jumper of the Citrus High
School, and George Edmonds, hur
dler and pole vaulter of Santa Bar
bara High School, both men having
registered in the University this
quarter.
According to Bill Ellington, coach
of the freshman tracksters,Meiers is j
one of the finest hurdling prospects
who has entered Stanford in many
years. Running for Citrus High
School, he chalked up marks of 25.8
scconds in the lows and lo.ii in the
highs. In the high jump Meiers has 1
cleared 5 feet 11 consistently.
Edmonds Promising
George Edmonds, who is young
er brother of the late Ward Ed
monds, one of Stanford's greatest
natural athletes, is following in the
l'oosteps of his great brother in the
pole vault and the hurdles. From
his performances with the Santa
Barbara High School he should
prove to bo a very valuable addi- 1
tion to the freshman track team.
For weight men Bill Ellington
feels confident that in Lyman, who
recently broke the intramural rec
ord in the shot-put, and Kuntzner, a
discus man who has been getting
124 l'eet, the freshmen will have a
pair equal to Gray and Laborde of
the Class of 1933.
Azevcdo Good
In the distances, Azevedo has run
off a 4.34 mile, time a freshman
team has not seen for quite a period.
Robert Birch seems to be the most j
likely candidate for the half-mile.
Wilson, in the sprints, brings back J
memories of Hec Dyer in his fresh
man year, and he should win many
points for the 1934 cinder-ponders.
The San Francisco All-Stars will
open the freshman track season here
on February 28. They will offer a
strong array and should prove a
very stiff test for the Indian babes.
