### 
EVANSTON, 111., Jan. 8. (/P)â€”'The
way to keep a pigeon from billing
and cooing, according to Sergeant
Bert Kinder of the Evanston police
force, is to muzzle them.
He came to this conclusion after ,
he had received a complaint from
Mrs. Charles R. Mahan, who said i
the pigeons were keeping her awake. I
and after fellow officers conducted I
an experiment to see if he knew i
what he was talking about.
