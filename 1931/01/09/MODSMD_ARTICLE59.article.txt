## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 8. (/Piâ€”Re
sponsibility for the health of stu
dents was laid on the doorstep of
the colleges today by the federal
office of education.
The governmental agency, noting
a failure on the part of land grant
college authorities to learn of-illness
promptly warned officials they "can
not free the schools of responsibility
for th(* health of students."
A laxity in housing and feeding
of undergraduates and lack of en
forcement of safety regulations,
especially drills guarding against
fire, was reported by the office in a
three-year survey of general condi
tions in the G9 land grant colleges,
which it has just completed.
