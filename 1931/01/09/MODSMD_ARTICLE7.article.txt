LOS ANGELES, Jan. 8. (IP)—
The courtroom fairly bulged
with ghosts, as May 11. Hyland
meekly told of heeding tips
from spirit hosts, in bravely
seeking hidden gold. Jay Hurl
but, charged with larceny, took
all her dough, she testified. "He
spoofed and spoke with spooks,
said she, "and said the spooks
all spoke of me.
''He said 'Fatima's' ghost
averred tbat she would spank
if I refused to give my roll and
take his word that it would be
most wisely used. lie showed
me notes from Spirit Land that
told of gold mines he would
share, but when he had my
cash in hand, the mines, like
spooks, became thin air.
''I feared Fatima's spanking
threat, and held my peace and
paid and paid, but I've felt
nothing of it yet, so jail this
guy—l'm not afraid.''
