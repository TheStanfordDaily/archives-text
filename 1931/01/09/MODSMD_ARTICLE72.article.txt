# HAPGOOD DISCUSSES FUTURE OF MODERN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM
## 
### 
William P. Hapgood, president of j
the Columbia Conserve Company of
Indianapolis, spoke on "Democracy !
in Industry" to members of the Stan
ford Christian Association, and the j
Y.W.C.A., and the Walrus Club last
night in the Old Union.
Hapgood stressed the probability '
of a business depression even worse
than the present one, unless radical
changes are made in the present eco
nomic and industrial system. He
told of the experiment conducted by j
his concern for the past fourteen J
years, the features of which are com- j
plete insurance of employes, a corp- i
oration owned and managed by the
workers, and a growing business af- I
fected but little by present depres
sion.
Hapgood's lecture was a story of !
theories become actualities, and so- !
cial experiments proving successful. 1
His company has been studied by t
representatives of Amtorg, Russian )
trading corporation; the Russians
have copied liberally from ideas de- ;
vcloped at the Indianapolis plant.
