# DRY ENACTMENT REPEAL LIKELY
## Twenty-Four States Ready To Vote On Recission Of Amendment 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (£»).—'The
prediction that 24 stales are now
ready to vote for repeal of the eight
eenth amendment, and that the 12
additional ones necessary for repeal
would follow within two years, was
made today by Henry H. Curran,
president of the Association Against
the Prohibition Amendment.
At the same lime he analyzed the
delegations of 12 states in the next
congress as containing 19 out of 24
senators in favor of submitting the
repeal question to the people, and
113 out of 160 representatives ready
to cast similar votes.
Needs Two-Thirds
"As to the other states," Curran
said, "there are several more sena
tors and at least 42 more representa
tives now ready to submit this ques
tion, but there are not yet two-thirds
of each house willing to do so.
"The function of Congress in this
matter is not one of decision, but
merely the administrative duty of
allowing the people to vote on the
question. How much longer is Con
gress going to deprive the people of
the right to vote?"
History Reviewed
Curran reviewed the anti-prohi
bition history of the 12 states, which
he said had "met the extreme con
stitutional requirement."' They were
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con
necticut, New York, New Jersey,
Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Louisiana, Montana, and Washing
ton.
