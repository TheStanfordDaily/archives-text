# PIKE STATES OPINIONS OF CONFERENCE
## Honor System Not Working In Most Colleges Pike Finds 
### 
Commenting on the difference in
attitude toward various phases of
student life in eastern and western
universities, as evinced at the recent
convention of the National Stu
dent Federation of America in At
lanta, Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president,
said yesterday that student govern
ment and spirit were among the
outstanding fields of differentiation.
"Much more faculty control is to
be found in the student govern
ments of the East than in the West,"
the student body head declared.
"Faculty members act in advisory
positions on executive councils in
some institutions; in others, where
administration is ostensibly in the
hands of the students, they control
it through the graduate manager."'
Student Interest
Hand in hand with this has gone
a decrease in student interest and
spirit, Pike feels. He reports many
complaints in .Atlanta of the diffi
culties of arousing interest in as
semblies and other activities, except
during football season. In some in
stances, this indifference has even
been exhibited during the season
when the team was not a winning
one.
Widespread censure of subsidiza
tion of athletes, particularly football
men, is prevalent among eastern
students, according to the A.S.S.U.
president. Athletic scholarships, con
trary to the western attitude, are
considered as definite forms of sub
sidy. Occasional differences in opin
ion are to be found in this, as in
other problems, he pointed out, men
tioning a proposal of one of the
delegates to give official recognition
to subsidization as a part of inter
collegiate athletics.
Honor System
The problem arising from the
prevalence of underhand practices
in examinations is also in the fore
ground of eastern student thought,
Pike declared. In comparatively few
institutions is the honor system
operating with a fair degree of suc
cess, the University of Virginia
being the sole seat of complete satis
faction with the system. There, Pike
said, the tradition of "Southern
Honor" is so strong that students
find it hard to believe in the exist
ence of any form of cheating where
the Honor Code is in operation.
"It was the general conclusion at
the convention,"he continued, "that
in universities with an enrollment
of more than 2500 students the honor
system tended to be impractical.
Trial of the system was advised,
even with a large student body, but
its rejection was recommended
strongly in the event of failure, lest
it become more pernicious. Non
urban colleges were held to be more
conducive to its success than ur
ban."
The A.S.S.U. executive spoke of
dress as one of the more striking,
although well-known, differences
between student life in the East
and in the West. As an instance of
this he spoke of the Surprise of a
woman delegates from Tulane, when
told that the Stanford man attends
classes in corduroys, sweater, and
an open collar.
