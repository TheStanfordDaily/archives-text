# COMMISSION DELAYS PROHIBITION REPORT
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. (/P.) â€”
With five of the eleven members of
the Law Enforcement Commission
out of Washington, the opinion was
expressed today that several more
days would be required before the
long-awaited prohibition report
could be presented to President
Hoover.
The finishing touches have not
been completed and it was believed
Ihe Commission would have some
difficulty in obtaining more than a
quorum at the next meeting on
Wednesday.
