### 
That the Stanford football eleven
may next year line up in the Big
Game against a Bear team coached
by William A. (Navy Bill) Ingram
was indicated last night by the an
nouncement that Ingram had re
signed as coach at Annapolis.
In announcing his resignation from
the helm of football affairs at the
United States Naval Academy, In
gram admitted to the Associated
Press at his home in Jeffersonville,
Ind., that he had signed a contract
10 days ago to coach at another
school.
This news was interpreted on the
Pacific Coast as meaning that the
navy mentor will next year step into
the position vacated by the resigna
tion of Clarence "Nibs" Price as
head football coach at the Univer
sity of California.
Won't Name School
Ingram refused to divulge the
name of the institution with which
he has signed, preferring to have
any announcement come from the
school itself.
Definite confirmation of Ingram's
selection to head the Bears was
lacking last night, but bay region
fans were sure he is the man.
William W. Monahan, U.C. gradu
ate manager, who recently returned
from an eastern trip in quest of a
coach, could not be reached last
night, having left for a week-end "in
the country." Dean T. M. Putnam
and President Robert Gordon
Sproule were also unavailable.
Former S.F. Coach

known in California, having been
coach and star player of the Twelfth
Naval District team in San Fran
cisco in 1919,
Ingram's tenure at Annapolis be
gan in 1920, when he turned out an
undefeated team. Of late he has
frequently been mentioned as a pos
sible successor to Price.
