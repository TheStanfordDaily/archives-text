# WATER COLORS OF LANDSCAPERS ON EXHIBITION OF ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A group of water color paintings
of landscapes, portraits, and decora- !
live abstractions of still life, by Ruth
Arner, youthful San Francisco art- j
ist, are on exhibition at the Stanford ;
Art Gallery.
In this exhibition, the artist pre- i
scnts a series of paintings that seek |
to express by their "form" certain •
aesthetic emotions similar to those
conveyed by musical selections.
In painting, form, as so under- I
stood, is a fitness resulting from the !
harmonious cohesion of rhythm, i
line, color, and relations of forms, j
according to the artist.
Likewise, the "form" of a painting i
is not concerned with the faithful

reproduction of any object. Whether
a house or a tree is precisely repro
duced is comparatively unimportant.
It has no connection with the story
a painting tells.
"Although many people appreciate
form in music," the artist explains,
"comparatively few pay any atten
tion to form in painting.
"In the field of form," Ruth Arner
concludes, "there is little difference
in the aesthetic emotions created by
the different arts. In form all the
arts have a similar quality."
The exhibit will close on January
25. The Art Gallery is open to the
public from 10 to 5 o'clock every
day. No admission is charged.
