# Fraternities Need Building Program; Greeks Must Act
## Associate Editor of Daily Claims Living Conditions of Fraternities Undesirable and Unsanitary; Administrative Policy Slows Action 
### JOHN B. ISAACS 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article on tlie fraternity housing
situation on the campus is presented for the benefit of interested readers,
the Interfraternity Board of Control, and the Intcrfraternity Council.
There is a definite need for better living conditions among members of
the fraternal organizations and because the University is unable to assume
the initiative of an extensive building campaign it is necessary that the
fraternities and their governing bodies—the Board of Control and the
Council—take definite steps to inaugurate such a program.)

Associate Editor, The Stanford Daily
With but one or two exceptions, Stanford fraternity houses are
poorly planned, lack necessary sanitary equipment, are veritable
fire traps, and are thoroughly worn out. The local row is as dis
reputable an array of dwellings as can be found on any campus.
Such threadbare houses are a detriment to this community.
It is difficult to imagine why (ireek-letter men have submitted
to such shabby surroundings, Part of this inactivity may be at
tributed to an uncertainty of the University's attitude and policy;
but perhaps even more is due to procrastination on the part of fra
ternal leaders.
In reality, the University demands but three things of any or
ganization preparing to build:
1. That all new houses be erected in the men's dor
mitory area, adjacent to Toyon and Branner halls.
2. That all such buildings be of permanent con
struction.
3. That the title to all fraternity houses shall be
held by the University.
'1 he desirability of a centralized location of all men's living
groups is generally agreed to by fraternity men. The present hap
hazard jumple of fraternity and sorority houses and private resi
dences is undesirable. A central living area would be another
important step to eliminate the ancient 11all-Row distinctions.
While the original costs of erecting a permanent structure of
concrete or stone are about twice as great as the average wood or
stucco fraternity house, the more expensive building will pay for
itself in the long run in that it will last indefinitely. The life of an
average $35,000 fraternity house is JO years. After that time the
building is ready to be abandoned unless more money is spent for
repairs, which, at best, are temporary.
The determination of the University to own all fra
ternity houses has found and will find much opposition
among fraternity men who fear that the University is
gaining too firm a hold on their freedom. Actually it
will make little difference whether the University holds
title to the buildings since it owns the ground on which
fraternity houses are located, and can and does exercise
just as much control as it could owning the buildings
as well. Managed by the Comptroller's office, mainte
nance and other items of operation could be handled
more efficiently than could be done by individuals.
The University may be criticized for not taking the initiative
and actively promoting a better housing program. I Jut, handi
capped by a lack of funds, the University has adopted the policy of
waiting until fraternities make the first move. It is a fraternity
problem, the administration feels, and thus far fraternity men have
shown little interest in solving it.
Little can be done until a committee of alumni and undergradu
ate fraternity men decide to meet with representatives of the Uni
versity and agree on a definite building plan, \fter that individual
fraternities, or better yet, groups of three or four can prepare to
build. The move will be slow, hirst, however, a definite program
must be agreed upon, and that business should be undertaken at
once. There are both undergraduate and alumni inter fraternity
bodies at Stanford. C )fiicers of each group should initiate immediate
action.
Financing new houses will present a very serious problem. A
large percentage, if not all, of the money must be raised by indi
vidual organizations. Kverv Stanford chapter, which has not already
done so, should start a building fund under alumni administration
so that money will be available when the time for construction ar
rives. The sum of money to be raised will be large, and the job of
financing will not be an easy one.
Stanford presents a pleasing appearance from the
entrance on Palm Drive. The Memorial Chapel, grace
ful arches, and towering palms all charm the visitor.
But the back yard presents a very different picture
where outworn houses line Lasuen "Shack" Row.
This job is one that must be undertaken at once. Conditions
are becoming more serious every year, and are made more acute
by overcrowding. It is not unusual to find M) men living in a
building designed to accommodate JO. The responsibility of elimi
nating these shacks rests equally on the University and fraternity
men. To get action, the fraternities should act first.

mitory area, adjacent to Toyon and Branner halls.
2. That all such buildings be of permanent con
struction.
3. That the title to all fraternity houses shall be
held by the University.
'1 he desirability of a centralized location of all men's living
groups is generally agreed to by fraternity men. The present hap
hazard jumple of fraternity and sorority houses and private resi
dences is undesirable. A central living area would be another
important step to eliminate the ancient 11all-Row distinctions.
While the original costs of erecting a permanent structure of
concrete or stone are about twice as great as the average wood or
stucco fraternity house, the more expensive building will pay for
itself in the long run in that it will last indefinitely. The life of an
average $35,000 fraternity house is JO years. After that time the
building is ready to be abandoned unless more money is spent for
repairs, which, at best, are temporary.
The determination of the University to own all fra
ternity houses has found and will find much opposition
among fraternity men who fear that the University is
gaining too firm a hold on their freedom. Actually it
will make little difference whether the University holds
title to the buildings since it owns the ground on which
fraternity houses are located, and can and does exercise
just as much control as it could owning the buildings
as well. Managed by the Comptroller's office, mainte
nance and other items of operation could be handled
more efficiently than could be done by individuals.
The University may be criticized for not taking the initiative
and actively promoting a better housing program. I Jut, handi
capped by a lack of funds, the University has adopted the policy of
waiting until fraternities make the first move. It is a fraternity
problem, the administration feels, and thus far fraternity men have
shown little interest in solving it.
Little can be done until a committee of alumni and undergradu
ate fraternity men decide to meet with representatives of the Uni
versity and agree on a definite building plan, \fter that individual
fraternities, or better yet, groups of three or four can prepare to
build. The move will be slow, hirst, however, a definite program
must be agreed upon, and that business should be undertaken at
once. There are both undergraduate and alumni inter fraternity
bodies at Stanford. C )fiicers of each group should initiate immediate
action.
Financing new houses will present a very serious problem. A
large percentage, if not all, of the money must be raised by indi
vidual organizations. Kverv Stanford chapter, which has not already
done so, should start a building fund under alumni administration
so that money will be available when the time for construction ar
rives. The sum of money to be raised will be large, and the job of
financing will not be an easy one.
Stanford presents a pleasing appearance from the
entrance on Palm Drive. The Memorial Chapel, grace
ful arches, and towering palms all charm the visitor.
But the back yard presents a very different picture
where outworn houses line Lasuen "Shack" Row.
This job is one that must be undertaken at once. Conditions
are becoming more serious every year, and are made more acute
by overcrowding. It is not unusual to find M) men living in a
building designed to accommodate JO. The responsibility of elimi
nating these shacks rests equally on the University and fraternity
men. To get action, the fraternities should act first.

situation on the campus is presented for the benefit of interested readers,

There is a definite need for better living conditions among members of
the fraternal organizations and because the University is unable to assume
the initiative of an extensive building campaign it is necessary that the
fraternities and their governing bodies—the Board of Control and the
Council—take definite steps to inaugurate such a program.)

With but one or two exceptions, Stanford fraternity houses are
poorly planned, lack necessary sanitary equipment, are veritable
fire traps, and are thoroughly worn out. The local row is as dis
reputable an array of dwellings as can be found on any campus.
Such threadbare houses are a detriment to this community.
It is difficult to imagine why (ireek-letter men have submitted

as well. Managed by the Comptroller's office, mainte
nance and other items of operation could be handled
more efficiently than could be done by individuals.
The University may be criticized for not taking the initiative
and actively promoting a better housing program. I Jut, handi
capped by a lack of funds, the University has adopted the policy of
waiting until fraternities make the first move. It is a fraternity
problem, the administration feels, and thus far fraternity men have
shown little interest in solving it.
Little can be done until a committee of alumni and undergradu
ate fraternity men decide to meet with representatives of the Uni
versity and agree on a definite building plan, \fter that individual
fraternities, or better yet, groups of three or four can prepare to
build. The move will be slow, hirst, however, a definite program
must be agreed upon, and that business should be undertaken at
once. There are both undergraduate and alumni inter fraternity
bodies at Stanford. C )fiicers of each group should initiate immediate
action.
Financing new houses will present a very serious problem. A
large percentage, if not all, of the money must be raised by indi
vidual organizations. Kverv Stanford chapter, which has not already
done so, should start a building fund under alumni administration
so that money will be available when the time for construction ar
rives. The sum of money to be raised will be large, and the job of
financing will not be an easy one.
Stanford presents a pleasing appearance from the
entrance on Palm Drive. The Memorial Chapel, grace
ful arches, and towering palms all charm the visitor.
But the back yard presents a very different picture
where outworn houses line Lasuen "Shack" Row.
This job is one that must be undertaken at once. Conditions
are becoming more serious every year, and are made more acute
by overcrowding. It is not unusual to find M) men living in a
building designed to accommodate JO. The responsibility of elimi
nating these shacks rests equally on the University and fraternity
men. To get action, the fraternities should act first.
