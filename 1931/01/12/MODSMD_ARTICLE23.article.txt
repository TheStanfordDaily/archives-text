# CAGE PLAYERS RETURN AFTER SOUTHERN TRIP
## Indians Make Determined Stand But Bruins Win Two Tilts PREPARE FOR TROJANS 
### Jack Jernegan 
Defeated but not downhearted,
Coach John Bunn and the Stanford
varsity basketball athletes are back
on the campus today following their
struggle in the lair of the U.C.L.A.
1 Bruins over the week-end.
Although the Indian hoopsters lost
I both starts against the southern ag
j gregation they have a mighty good
! account of themselves and ably ful
: filled Coach Bunn's prediction that
! they would make a ball game out
i of each one. According to press re
! ports, Stanford spotted tha Bruins
j to a IG-point lead at the start of
the first game and a 10-point ad
vantage in the second contest, but
came back to outscore the opposi
tion in the greater part of both
i games.
Game Hard-Fought
Evidence of the hard-fought na
, ture of the final tilt is given by the
fact that it was decided by a long
toss half the length of the court in
the last minute of play. Linthicum,
j U.C.L.A. center, who made the
throw, was the Cardinal nemesis in
the opening game as well, scoring
12 points on six field goals.
The loss of the first two engage
ments should not cause Stanford
fans to brand the present conference
season a total failure. It is true that
the results of these games has dissi
pated most of the overly-optimistic
hopes for a championship which
may have been aroused by the early
promise of the Redskins, but in the
i fine showing made by the men under
; a new system reasonable Card sup
porters can see plenty of hope for
futui'e seasons.
May Come Back
Besides, defeat at the hands of
U.C.L.A. does not mean that Stan
ford may not yet take the measure
of California and U.S.C., neither of
which teams have shown strength
to equal that of the Bruins. A Bruin
slump later in the season may wipe
out the two-game lead gained at
Stanford's expense and throw the
! Redshirts again into the running.
Before them the Redskin warriors
have a full week in which to correct
any en'ors brought to light in the
! games down South and to get set
for a new start. Coach Sam Barry
' will lead the hosts of U.S.C. up to
the Farm at the end of the week
for a brace of conference tilts on
Friday and Saturday, but there will
be no mid-week game.

for a new start. Coach Sam Barry
' will lead the hosts of U.S.C. up to
the Farm at the end of the week
for a brace of conference tilts on
Friday and Saturday, but there will
be no mid-week game.
Defeated but not downhearted,
Coach John Bunn and the Stanford
varsity basketball athletes are back
on the campus today following their
struggle in the lair of the U.C.L.A.
1 Bruins over the week-end.
Although the Indian hoopsters lost
I both starts against the southern ag
j gregation they have a mighty good
! account of themselves and ably ful
: filled Coach Bunn's prediction that
! they would make a ball game out
i of each one. According to press re
! ports, Stanford spotted tha Bruins
j to a IG-point lead at the start of
the first game and a 10-point ad
vantage in the second contest, but
came back to outscore the opposi
tion in the greater part of both
i games.
Game Hard-Fought
Evidence of the hard-fought na
, ture of the final tilt is given by the
fact that it was decided by a long
toss half the length of the court in
the last minute of play. Linthicum,
j U.C.L.A. center, who made the
throw, was the Cardinal nemesis in
the opening game as well, scoring
12 points on six field goals.
The loss of the first two engage
ments should not cause Stanford
fans to brand the present conference
season a total failure. It is true that
the results of these games has dissi
pated most of the overly-optimistic
hopes for a championship which
may have been aroused by the early
promise of the Redskins, but in the
i fine showing made by the men under
; a new system reasonable Card sup
porters can see plenty of hope for
futui'e seasons.
May Come Back
Besides, defeat at the hands of
U.C.L.A. does not mean that Stan
ford may not yet take the measure
of California and U.S.C., neither of
which teams have shown strength
to equal that of the Bruins. A Bruin
slump later in the season may wipe
out the two-game lead gained at
Stanford's expense and throw the
! Redshirts again into the running.
Before them the Redskin warriors
have a full week in which to correct
any en'ors brought to light in the
! games down South and to get set
for a new start. Coach Sam Barry
