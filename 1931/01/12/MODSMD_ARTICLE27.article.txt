And once again the tale is of Roble and row, of house and
house. Once more the Five Hundred are going through the annual
procedure of being agog. And still again the air is full of advice —
to be taken or left.
Sane judgment, scarce as it is under stress, is all that is necessary
to carry one through rushing. A woman with a calm, cool, steady
brain will quickly discern, first of all, that for those who stay at
Roble the world does not end. There has been discovered no appre-
ciable difference between the basic metabolisms of row and hall
women. In fact, "much can be said on both sides."
The same cool and steady thinker, meeting the problem of choice
among several houses, must weigh carefully. She must examine
the standards which have directed her life and her environment in
the past, and she must determine the set of values which are going
to govern her life in the future. The things which she believes to
be really important after serious consideration, the things which
she will count as really important after college — these are the things
for which she must look in the houses which she is judging.
In other words, put thought above emotions. Choose with all
your brain, and then enjoy your choice with all your heart.
