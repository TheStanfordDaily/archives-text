						NEW POINT OF VIEW
## 
### 
With the development of tlie newspaper from the literary weekly j
of the j)a>t into the news-gathering, news-publishing in-tilution it is
today, there has eomc a changed view as to the merits of publicity. I
At one time publicity which would result from the printing of a j
news story in a daily paper was fell to be synonymous with nolo-1
riety and. accordingly, something to lk\ avoided.
Hut thi.s attitude is changing. The newspaper public is now
coming to believe as do newspaper publishers that there is nothing
inherently wrong or harmful in publicity and that it may often be j
used to serve worth-while purposes. More and more persons arc j
becoming convinced thai news concealment generally leads to far
worse effects than does news publication.
In this regard, the Houston I'ress advocates the printing of j
all crime news as a deterrent of crmie. The i'ress declares: "We '
cannot avoid printing crime news, but we can prevent crime being]
made attractive. . . . I Vint crime news, yes. because, that is our duty,
but tell the story so that the world will shudder, not desire to
emulate." This is a clear statement of the way publicity can and ;
should be used.
In any newspaper field, whether it be rural, college, or metro
politan, the advantages of publicity, rightly handled, arc ever apt:
to outweigh the disadvantages. C onsiderations of public welfare j
alone can justify the suppression of news facts possessed of sttHi-j
< ient reader interest to demand being given publicity.
