# RELATIVITY 'SIMPLE' SAYS STANFORD MAN
## 
### 
David L. Webster, professor of
physics at Stanford, claims to un
derstand the Einstein theory of rela
livity and is certain that the theory
is intellectual apple pie to many
more than the 12 whom Einstein
himself declares alone arc fitted to
the task.
Equipped with an understanding
of the fourth dimension and a
knowledge of non-Euclidian geome
try, the theory loses its trickiness
and becomes childishly simple. This
study of the essential preliminaries
is becoming more and more general,
Professor Webster states, and the
theory will soon be common talk
among the average laymen.
