Oil SAILOR BEHAVE. At the Stan
ford Theater.
Mediocre slapstick by Olsen and
Johnson. Sometimes the lines are
lively, but the plot never is, and a
fairly personable cast sinks under
its inanity.
The blonde menace of the show is
plump. This is a mistake, for it
renders the triangle idea about
which the story revolves utterly
unconvincing and unexciting. Blonde
charmers should be svelte and silken
this year. The foreigner in the show
is also a mistake. He is not distin
guished.
Charles Kin« is a nice boy. He did
some acting in an earlier show, and
he may act in his next show. Low
ell Sherman, as an indolent das
tardly nobleman, gives the best per
formance of the picture. Lowell
Sherman's acting can generally be
depended upon. But even a good
show needs more than one actor, and
Oh Sailor Behave at best is wheezy
and spasmodic.

PETER PAN. At the Ctirran Thea
ter.
Peter Pan, for Marion Clayton
played herself into her part so suc
cessfully that her personality was
Peter Pan, won again the admiration
and enthusiasm of every member of
the audience. A more definite suc
cess is hard to imagine since not

| only children but grown people were
swept off their feet.
It was so successful and so con
vincing, because, in a way, Peter
and Wendy represent to a large ex
tent our childhood dreams • and
imaginings. Added to this fact thaf
the production was exquisite, and
truly in keeping with the spirit of
j Sir James Barrie's beautiful play,
i and you have the secret of its appeal
1 and popularity.

THE WAY OF ALL MEN. At the
Varsity Theater,
If the end of this picture were
| omitted, one would be inclined to
I believe that the old melodrama was
resurrected. With the ending, The
Way of All Men is a rather clever
device to cause merriment.
The plot is original. The Missis
sippi floods a town, trapping eleven
, people in a cafe. Most of the eleven
: are mortal enemies, but with the
approach of certain death all is for
given. The forgiving is carried to
an almost laughable extreme with
i much talk of "brothers" and hymn
singing. The next morning when
the flood is found to be a false
alarm there 'is a different story.
Noah Beery, Douglas Fairbanks
Jr., and Dorothy Revier have the
leads. While there is no exceptional
work, the story is well handled and
j runs smoothly.
