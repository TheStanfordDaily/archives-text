# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
This is the season when all good
alums and true must come to ihe
aid of their sorority, or risk sacri
ficing the million-dollar nuggets to
the Givno Ding girls.
Personally, we feel for the spon
sors, who have seen happier days
in their own houses, and must now
sacrifice their shoulders to Roble
teai's.
According to Webster, a sponsor is
"one who makes himself responsible,
as for the duty or debt of another;
specifically a god-mother or god
father."'
Every sponsor should have (1) A
four-year course in the Stanford
School for Doctors and Nurses. (2)
Daily chanting of the sponsorial
ritual, "Yes, I was a girl myself,
once." (3) Booklet explaining un
qualified excellence of her sorority,
with directions for using.
The masculine version includes (4)
A grim determination to suppress
outbreaks on the fourth floor of En
cina, and (5) An intuitive knowledge
of where lost articles, such as com
fortable chairs, study lamps, tire

1 covers, and other modern necessities,
| are to be located without too much
embarrassment to the guilty fresh
| man. It's a great life!
That still means if you don't
weaken, of course. And may we re
ligiously implore you not to weaken?
After all, abstinence makes the
I heart grow fonder .... That's
!
( worth a lot.
! The Indian cagers went South and
tried hard for us. Even if they
! didn't score very well against
j U.C.L.A., it was probably very
I much worth the trip. Maybe a coach
i or so doesn't make so very much
; difference, if the weather is wrong.

Monday morning brings the be
ginning of a week of real concentra
tion. Work is already piled sky high
: in front of us all, and we really won
der if it's worth it. That's the insidi
! ous thing about tuition (Unpleasant
j Graft). One never knows when one
I has it
