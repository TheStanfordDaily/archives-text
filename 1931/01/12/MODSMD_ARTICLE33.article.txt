Bridge is the new intramural
sport that lias been introduced
at the University of Florida. The
ATO's won the campus cham
pionship. hy virtue of some hard,
fast, and clean playing.
In the first rubber John Doe of
the ATO's bi'oke away for a neat
gain of 400 points. In the second
period, the champs used the famous
dummy play to net the necessary
points.
A member of (he faculty at
the University of Oregon be
lieves crime waves are a myth.
Well, that should clear up the
Capone-Moran situation in Chi
cago.
And if the same professor will
only state that crime itself, is a
myth, Chicago will be so quiet that
a ride on the merry-go-round will
be the most exciting thing in town
and all the present gangsters will
become confessional artists for
Luekies.
A student at North Carolina State
College was expelled for two years
for claiming that cheating was pres
ent on the campus.
Wonder what the penally for ac
tual cheating in such an institution
would be.
A comparative census taken at
De Pauw University reveals that
mustaches are fast losing their for
mer popularity.
This is to he expected for they
constitute a fire hazard for
cigarette smokers; they get in
the way of milkshake fiends, and
are ticklish.
The University of McGill pleads
for a true college novel. McGill will
never have its wish fulfilled be
cause if a true college story were
ever written, it would never be pub
lished as half of the book would
never "get by" the censors and the
other half would never "get over"
to the general public.
Juniors at the University of
Pennsylvania carry canes. The
freshmen probably carry books;
the sophomores might carry
paddles; and the seniors would
carry their heads high. Every
body happy!
