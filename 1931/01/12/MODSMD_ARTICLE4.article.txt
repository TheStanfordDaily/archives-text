# STANFORD PHYSICIST INVENTS SCREWDRIVER
## 
### 
Professor Perley A. Ross of the
Stanford physics department is the
inventor of an X-ray spectometer, a
substitute for a screwdriver. By di
recting a stream of electrons at the
head of a screw the machine will
drive it into the wood. The only
practical disadvantages of the in
vention are that the screw must be
started by a hand screwdriver and
that it costs $5000.
