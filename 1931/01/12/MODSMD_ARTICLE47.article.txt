Although the Conference records |
show solely that Stanford lost two ,
-james to the University of California
at Los Angeles five, more than a ray j
cf hope should lighten the path of
the progressing Indians'. To lose
one game-by a long toss in the final
seconds of play is no disgrace, and
it was Linthicum's shot that saved
Saturday's fray for the Bruins.
All in all, it was quite a week
end for the Stanford tosscrs.
The main difficulty appeared to
he in the Indian's slow start. If
the first ten minutes of each
contest could have been elimi- |
natcd—well, anyway, the Red
shirts played basketball once
they were under way.
But enough of the past. Entirely
too much future lies ahead of the |
cage customers to dwell on history, j
But two tilts will be played this
week, but those will be of gigantic j
proportions. On Friday and Saturday ;
evenings between the hours of 8
and 9:30 o'clock the Indians will
play host to the Trojans of Southern
California.
Defending champions, al- i
though sharers of the Confer
ence cellar at present wiili the
Indians, the men of Barry will
be a rather large-sized mouth
ful. In fact, tiie mouthful may
even choke live Red Men before
another Sunday rolls around,
for the boys from down L.A.
way are tall, tough, and trouble
some. Ask anybody, even "Dink"
Templeton.
And on the week-end, following
the visit of the Trojans, wo find the
basket-tossers invading the Oakland
Auditorium to tangle with no less (
than the Golden Bears of Berkeley.
Little Nibs Price no doubt has a
slight incentive to win this year .
In fact, the old adage may
have to be amended to read:
"There is no peace for the
wicked, and for the Stanford
basketball teams." In spite of
the obvious improvement in the
local exhibitions of casaba toss
ing, improvements have been
made in other camps, and it ;
still looks like a long, hard win
ter.
But still we are going to be hope
ful about it all. Stanford will win
more than a few games in 1931 —of
that we are certain. Good guards, a I
fighting outfit, plus a sound style of i
play, are bound to click and pro- i
duce results. For that reason the '
Indians are always dangerous.
Win or lose, we like to watch,
the cagers. Not only because
they represent the University—
but bccause they are always in
there trying, no matter how tall
or how lucky or how uncanny the
oppostion is in riitging the buck
et. A team like that is worth a !
dozen outfits who win and then
look as though they arc pained
because they were forced to
work. —L. K.. Jr.

Although the Conference records |
show solely that Stanford lost two ,
-james to the University of California
at Los Angeles five, more than a ray j
cf hope should lighten the path of
the progressing Indians'. To lose
one game-by a long toss in the final
seconds of play is no disgrace, and
it was Linthicum's shot that saved
Saturday's fray for the Bruins.
All in all, it was quite a week
end for the Stanford tosscrs.
The main difficulty appeared to
he in the Indian's slow start. If
the first ten minutes of each
contest could have been elimi- |
natcd—well, anyway, the Red
shirts played basketball once
they were under way.
But enough of the past. Entirely
too much future lies ahead of the |
cage customers to dwell on history, j
But two tilts will be played this
week, but those will be of gigantic j
proportions. On Friday and Saturday ;
evenings between the hours of 8
and 9:30 o'clock the Indians will
play host to the Trojans of Southern
California.
Defending champions, al- i
though sharers of the Confer
ence cellar at present wiili the
Indians, the men of Barry will
be a rather large-sized mouth
ful. In fact, tiie mouthful may
even choke live Red Men before
another Sunday rolls around,
for the boys from down L.A.
way are tall, tough, and trouble
some. Ask anybody, even "Dink"
Templeton.
And on the week-end, following
the visit of the Trojans, wo find the
basket-tossers invading the Oakland
Auditorium to tangle with no less (
than the Golden Bears of Berkeley.
Little Nibs Price no doubt has a
slight incentive to win this year .
In fact, the old adage may
have to be amended to read:
"There is no peace for the
wicked, and for the Stanford
basketball teams." In spite of
the obvious improvement in the
local exhibitions of casaba toss
ing, improvements have been
made in other camps, and it ;
still looks like a long, hard win
ter.
But still we are going to be hope
ful about it all. Stanford will win
more than a few games in 1931 —of
that we are certain. Good guards, a I
fighting outfit, plus a sound style of i
play, are bound to click and pro- i
duce results. For that reason the '
Indians are always dangerous.
Win or lose, we like to watch,
the cagers. Not only because
they represent the University—
but bccause they are always in
there trying, no matter how tall
or how lucky or how uncanny the
oppostion is in riitging the buck
et. A team like that is worth a !
dozen outfits who win and then
look as though they arc pained
because they were forced to
work. —L. K.. Jr.
