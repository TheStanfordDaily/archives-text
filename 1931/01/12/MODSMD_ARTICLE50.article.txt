# Frosh Hoopmen Down S.F.U. Babes 33 To 28
## REDSKINS LOCATE BASKET TO ANNEX RAGGED STRUGGLE Topping High Point Man; Poor Floor Work Mars Play 
### Lowell Cox 
Finding the basket with some de
gree of consistency for the first time
this season, the Indian freshmen
downed the University of San Fran
cisco yearlings, 33 to 28, at the
Pavilion Saturday night.
Returning from Los Angeles,
Coach John Bunn will find himself
confronted, however, with a still un
polished frosh quintet. Usually fast
breaking and good on floorwork, the
babes Saturday showed little of the
speed that characterized their previ
ous games. Only new-found ability
to sink baskets from various angles
of the floor saved them from defeat.
Reverse of Llkiah Tilt
The S.F.U. contest was just the
reverse of the Ukiah game of a
week ago, when the Indian young
sters ran circles around the high
school five, only to lose a close de
cision through lack of ability to hit
the buckct.
When the babes combine the
speed of the Ukiah fracas with the
sharp shooting of Saturday night's
affair, it should be an unbeatable
combination.
Topping High Scorer
Topping was high-point man of
the Gray Fog engagement, sinking
five field goals and three free throws
for a total of 13 tallies. Packard
contributed a total of seven and
Massey and Smith six apiece. Kin
canin was the outstanding man for
the invaders, accounting for 11 of
their 28 points.
After leaving the floor at half time
on the short end of a 19-15 count,
the San Francisco five returned
after the intermission to make a de
termined bid. Two foul shots and
buckets by Mohr and Kincanin
gave them a temporary 21-20 lead.
Play speeded up somewhat and the
handful of half-frozen fans became
hopeful of- a close race down the
stretch.
Cards Get Lead
Two successive long shots by
Smith and a basket by Topping,
while the visitors could account for
but one, removed the irhmediate
danger. San Francisco called for
time out, but after the rest Massey
found the basket for two more long
shots, and Stanford had a seven
point lead.
The Farm youngsters seemed to
give up all idea of working the ball
under the basket, using long shots
continually, while failure to follow
up cost both sides potential tallies.
Only in the closing minutes did
the game show any further signs of
life, with the Gray Fog striving to
break up Stanford's stalling.
