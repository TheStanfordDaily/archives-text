# THOSE WERE THE DAYS
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Ten years ago, Judge* Kenesaw
Mountain Landis was officially dele
gated Commissioner of Organized
Baseball at the National Association
of Professional Baseball Leagues'
annual meeting, held in Chicago.
Sixteen major league clubs signed
a contract for a seven-year term
for him, and the minors had already
pledged their support. And I'll
betcha that that hat the Judge wears
around to the world series nowadays
wasn't new in January 1921, either!
Also ten years ago: William Glea
son (the "Kid" himself) was signed
to manage the White Sox . . . and
Eppa Jephtha Rixey was traded to
Cincinnati for Ring, pitcher, and
Neale, outfielder, by the Phillies.
Twenty years ago, "Tham" Lang
ford beat Joe Jeannette in twelve
rounds in Boston. These two great
fighters had met before and were
to meet again, for the act featuring
the "Boston Tar Baby" and his
dark-skinned playmate with the
French name was to go down in
fistic history as one of the most oft
repeated of any.
Sam lost to Joe in 1905, won from
him in 1906. they fought draws in
1907 and 1908 (a no decision affair
in 1908), Langford won- in 1910 and
'11, two more no decision affairs
followed in '11 and '13, and they put
on a grand climax in Paris in 1913
with Langford winning in twenty
rounds! Sam was one of the hardest
hitters who ever lived, and Joe, ac
cording to Harry Wills, was one of
the most gentlemanly of all fighters.
Thirty years ago at the Crowder
heme in Winston Salem, North
Carolina, the stork deposited a small
but noisy bundle that proved to be

| young Alvin, who was to develop
into one of the American League's
best right-handed pitchers. Young
Crowder has grown quite a' bit since
January 11, 1901. He's five feet ten
inches tall, weighs more than 170
now, and they call him "General"
j around the American League.
He won twenty-one games for the
Browns in 1928, seventeen in 1929,
1 and eighteen in 1930, dividing his
time between the St. Louis and
Washington teams during the latter
season. His earned run average was
! 3.89 in .1930, and he worked in
' twenty-five complete games. Only
Lyons of the White Sox worked in
more complete games last season.
Crowder used to be with the Sena
tors back in 1926 and part of '27.


Langford and Jeannette, Iwo Great Colored Fighters,
Battled Nine Times Between 1905-1913
