# INDIAN GRID SQUAD TO LOSE CAGLIERI FOR '31 CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
Guido Caglieri, Pop Warner's
hard-hitting right halfback, will be
lost to the Cardinals in 1931. He has
decided not to return to school next
fall, although he will finish out the
present year.
Caglieri was rated as a regular in
the Stanford backfield this year, al
though crippled by a shoulder in
jury much of the time. Warner will
undoubtedly miss his driving power,
since Guido was counted on to in
ject much punch into the Warner
reverses.
Caglieri was to have had one
more year of competition, and there
is every likelihood that he would
have shown as a gridiron star of the
first magnitude.
