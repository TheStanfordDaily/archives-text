# INTRAMURAL CAGE TEAMS TO START TOURNEY TONIGHT
## Sigma Chi To Open Fight To Hold Title; Four Tilts Scheduled 
### 
Opening guns of the battle for
the 1931 intramural basketball title
will sound this evening in the
Pavilion and Encina gym at 7 and
8 o'clock, when 8 of the 41 aspirants
for the championship spoils of 50
intramural points, the Hastings bas- i
ketball trophy, and much campus
glory swing into action.
Among the eight is Sigma Chi,
1930 champions, which is to meet
the Stanford Club in the Pavilion :
at 8 o'clock. This contest has an 1
especial significance because it
should give a line on whether this
year's Sigma Chi quintet stands a |
chance of retaining the honors won
by the 1930 edition. If they should |
win again, they will gain perma
nent possession of the Hastings ;
trophy, awarded to the organization
first winning it twice.
Two Veterans Back
With Joujon-Roche and Gold
water from last year's quintet as a
nucleus, Sigma Chi will have an- ;
other strong team, but the question
is whether it will be strong enough 1
to survive a field of 42.
Chief challenger of the champion's J
attempt to repeat is Sequoia I. Led j
by Herb Palmberg, perhaps the best j
forward in last year's tournament,
their team nicludes George Getts, j
former center for Occidental Col
lege, and Art Hunnicutt, a 1930 all- ~
conference guard for Whittier.
