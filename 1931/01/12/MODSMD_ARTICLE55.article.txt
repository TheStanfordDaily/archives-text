# BASEBALL PROSPECTS APPEAR GOOD AS SQUAD OF 40 TAKES FIRST WORKOUTS
## 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Hickory met horsehide with the '
old familiar smack last Friday and
Saturday afternoons as the Indian
baseball varsity took its first work
outs of the 1931 season.
With some forty ball-tossers out
in uniform at the first practice ses
sions and performing in good early
season form, prospects look bright
for Coach Harry Wolter's nine this
year. Practice will continue when
ever weather and diamond condi
tions will permit with a view toward i
having a well-balanced team on the I
field for a series of non-conference
games, to begin late this month.
Wolter Picks Infield
At Saturday's workout Wolter had
the veteran Spud Hardy working
behind the plate with a tentative
"number one" infield. Cook, first
baseman of last year's varsity, was
holding down the initial sack, while
Dykes Johnson, who was a regular
innelder last season, was scooping
up grounders at third. Philippi, a
transfer from Fullerton Junior Col
lege and a brother of Bob Philippi,
former Stanford pitcher, was on sec
ond. At shortstop Wolter had Bert 1
Delmas, captain of last year's babe
nine.
Other infielders who had their |
turns on the bases Saturday were '
Cutshaw, a regular second-baseman
from last season, Fox and Marks at
fn st, and Lee and Tucker, shortstop.
Infielders from the 1933 nine who
are out in varsity uniforms and will
give the regulars a run for their
money are Triplett, Sauflay, Bern
thai, and Redhead. Livermore, for
mer freshman third-baseman, is re- ;
covering from an arm injury but
will be out later.
Pitchers Missed
The success or failure of the pres- |
ent season, it seems, will be decided i
on the mound. Story, Taylor,
Leverenz, three aces of last year's
hurling staff, will be missed by the [

Indians. Loomis is back as the most
experienced chucker on the squad.
Other pitchers out include Caddel,
Spencer, Plymire, Rhiede, and Mill
sap. A valuable addition to the
group of Indian moundsmen is Dan
Johnson, star right-hander of the
1933 frosh, who should be given a
share of the pitching burden this
year.
Outfield Strong
Behind the plate are Hardy and
Oswill, who did a lot of the back
stopping for last season's hurlers.
In addition to these two are Dixon
and Thurman.
The Stanford outfield looks
stronger than jmy other division of
the team. Captain John Hunken will
be back at his old place in left field,
and Campbell is out again for his
berth in right. The center garden
will be covered by Rintala, leading
batter of last season, who is now
busy earning another block "S" for
himself in basketball. Mears, an ex
perienced first-baseman, will also
join the squad at the completion of
the hoop season.

Leverenz, three aces of last year's
hurling staff, will be missed by the [

Indians. Loomis is back as the most
experienced chucker on the squad.
Other pitchers out include Caddel,
Spencer, Plymire, Rhiede, and Mill
sap. A valuable addition to the
group of Indian moundsmen is Dan
Johnson, star right-hander of the
1933 frosh, who should be given a
share of the pitching burden this
year.
Outfield Strong
Behind the plate are Hardy and
Oswill, who did a lot of the back
stopping for last season's hurlers.
In addition to these two are Dixon
and Thurman.
The Stanford outfield looks
stronger than jmy other division of
the team. Captain John Hunken will
be back at his old place in left field,
and Campbell is out again for his
berth in right. The center garden
will be covered by Rintala, leading
batter of last season, who is now
busy earning another block "S" for
himself in basketball. Mears, an ex
perienced first-baseman, will also
join the squad at the completion of
the hoop season.
Hickory met horsehide with the '
old familiar smack last Friday and
Saturday afternoons as the Indian
baseball varsity took its first work
outs of the 1931 season.
With some forty ball-tossers out
in uniform at the first practice ses
sions and performing in good early
season form, prospects look bright
for Coach Harry Wolter's nine this
year. Practice will continue when
ever weather and diamond condi
tions will permit with a view toward i
having a well-balanced team on the I
field for a series of non-conference
games, to begin late this month.
Wolter Picks Infield
At Saturday's workout Wolter had
the veteran Spud Hardy working
behind the plate with a tentative
"number one" infield. Cook, first
baseman of last year's varsity, was
holding down the initial sack, while
Dykes Johnson, who was a regular
innelder last season, was scooping
up grounders at third. Philippi, a
transfer from Fullerton Junior Col
lege and a brother of Bob Philippi,
former Stanford pitcher, was on sec
ond. At shortstop Wolter had Bert 1
Delmas, captain of last year's babe
nine.
Other infielders who had their |
turns on the bases Saturday were '
Cutshaw, a regular second-baseman
from last season, Fox and Marks at
fn st, and Lee and Tucker, shortstop.
Infielders from the 1933 nine who
are out in varsity uniforms and will
give the regulars a run for their
money are Triplett, Sauflay, Bern
thai, and Redhead. Livermore, for
mer freshman third-baseman, is re- ;
covering from an arm injury but
will be out later.
Pitchers Missed
The success or failure of the pres- |
ent season, it seems, will be decided i
on the mound. Story, Taylor,
Leverenz, three aces of last year's
hurling staff, will be missed by the [

Indians. Loomis is back as the most
experienced chucker on the squad.
