# AVOIDABLE DEATHS LAID TO CLASH OF SCIENCE, RELIGION
## Speaker States 100,000 Die Unnecessarily In U.S. Every Year 
### 
Friction between the laboratory i
and the pulpit is annually causing |
at least 100,000 preventable deaths j
in the United States, 10,000 of which
occur in California, according to Dr. [
W. H. Manwaring of the department j
of bacteriology and experimental j
pathology, who lectured on "Com- j
parative Religiotherapy" Friday eve- t
ning in Lane Hall, San Francisco. |
His talk was the first of a series of !
popular medical lectures which are
to be given fortnightly at ihe Stan- i
ford School of Medicine.
"For this disharmony," he said, i
"biological science with its aggres
sive superficialities is by no means j
blameless; a frank admission on the j
part of material medicine that many j
if not mort of its basic concepts are |
but camouflaged religion might heal
the breach.
"Current religiotherapy offers no j
technic which has not already re- j
ceived a millenium-long clinical J
trial, resulting in 13 centuries of
elinical disappointment.
"Many of the present spiritual |
therapies are but echoes of long- :
discarded stone age pathology."
In Dr. Manwaring's opinion, it |
cannot be overemphasized that the i
discard of such therapies was not j
due to loss of religious faith, but to !
sincere conviction that such ecclesi
astic wizardry is contrary to divine '
will.
