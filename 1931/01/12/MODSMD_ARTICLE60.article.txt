There are more women enrolled
for hockey than for any other course
in the Physical Education depart
ment in spite of the fact that this
sport has been transferred from Fall
to Winter quarter this year because
of the building of the new gymna

85, though dancing, the ether ac
tivity for which Women's Athletic
Association points will be granted
this quarter, runs a close second
with 73.
More sophomore women are re

usually the greatest. The largest
dancing class is the advanced, which
contains 25.
Fencing, equitation, advanced golf,
games, posture, and corrective are
the various fields in which the re
maining G1 women registered for
