# READING OF NEGRO PLAY TO FEATURE TUESDAY LECTURE
## 
### 
The reading of Marc Connelly's !
"Green Pastures," the play that has j
created such a sensation in Now- j
York, will be the feature of the pro
gram scheduled by the Committee !
on Public Exercises to be held in the j
Little Theater at 7:30 o'clock tomor
row evening. Novelty is character
istic of '"Green Pastures," which re- J
quires an all-negro cast and imper- ;
sonates God on the stage.
Anthony F. Blanks, associate pro
fessor of public speaking at the Uni- j
versity of California, has been se- j
lected to read the play. According
to Lee Emerson Bassett, professor of j
public speaking at Stanford, Blanks j
is particularly well suited to be an
interpreter of the play, having been j
raised in the south.
The public will remember him 1
for his rendition of "Caponsacchi" ;
here several years ago.
