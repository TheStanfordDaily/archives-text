# FEAR CRASH OF PAYLOAD PLANE
## Woman Pilot Overdue On Flight To Azores 
### 
HORTA, Azores, Jan. 11. (/P) —
Rockets flashed through the dark
and stormy sky tonight in attempts
to pierce a heavy cloud-bank as a
guide to the American seaplane
"Trade Wind," long overdue on a
payload flight from Bermuda.
As the night wore on, inhabitants
of Horta virtually gave up hope that
the white monoplane would be able
to fight against a prevailing gale
from the northeast and reach these
islands safely.
The local wireless station continu
ally crackled out requests for news
of the plane from ships, but no in
formation was received.
The plane, piloted by Lieutenant
William S. MacLaren and Mrs.
Beryl Hart, was due at about 11:15
o'clock this morning (1:15 o'clock
Eastern Standard Time.)
A lighter with fuel aboard for the
plant awaited its arrival in the har
bor. A crowd of persons who had
gathered to watch the preparations
dispersed as hours passed without
any word of the plane.
The plane "Trade Wind," when it
left Bermuda, carried 300 gallons of
gasoline which, it was estimated,
would be sufficient to keep it in the
air until 6 o'clock Sunday night.
Backers of the flight said this sup
ply of gas would be enough to carry
the plane to the mainland of Portu
gal and advanced the possibility the
plane might have continued directly
to Europe without stopping at the
Azores for refueling.
