# COACHES' SALARIES MAY SUFFER FROM DEPRESSED SEASON
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Jan. 11 (#•). —A j
I new undertone of uncertainty in the :
i football tutoring profession looms
| in the wake of the 1930 season of j
; "depressed" gate receipts. From one!
. source comes a hint that the coaches j
may have to take a wage cut.
E. C. Gallagher, athletic director |
of Oklahoma A. & A. College, says ]
that if drastic retrenchment results !
from any rcduced "take" at the sta
dium, coaches' salaries should bear j
part of the burden. This was offered
I despite the announcement that the
' Aggies had a "banner" year in foot
ball.
Caution enters the situation else
where. The University of Missouri
is not expanding its present coach
ing staff. "We are just marking time j
to see what business conditions are j
going to be," says C. L. Brewer,
Missouri athletic director.
One critic, who prefers anonymity, |
points to an impasse adding to the \
troubles that harass the lives of j
coaches. He asserts only ordinary, ;
unattractive contests will suffer from
defection of the cash customers. ■
"People have the money but are a '
little more particular as to how they
spend it,"he declares. "Coaches are <
pressed to turn out better teams." 1
