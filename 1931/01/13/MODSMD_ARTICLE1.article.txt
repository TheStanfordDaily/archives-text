# BUNN WORKING ON OFFENSIVE FOR S.C. GAME
## Reynolds Leading Scorers; Squad Concentrating On Sinking Shots BRUIN GAME EXPLAINED 
### Jack Jernegan 
Coach Bunn set out yesterday to
give the Stanford basketball varsity
an offense that will blast its way
through to the basket and sink
"sucker" shots as well as the long
tosses.
With the strong U.S.C. team in
vading the campus this coming
week-end, Bunn concentrated his
energies upon the business of teach
ing his charges the all-important
trick of putting the ball in the only
place it scores any points, through
the hoop.
Shooting Workout
Working against the reserves, the
first-string men employed an infor
mal scrimmage as a mean of mas
tering a fast attack centered on the
"hole" under the basket. The work
of the guards in driving in at full
speed to take passes and spin the
casaba into the net was the chief
feature of the scrimmage.
Running on the first line com
bination were Moffatt and Cordry,
forwards; Reynolds, center; Rintala
and Fawcett, guards. Cordry's good
work in the games with U.C.L.A. ap
pears to have put him back at the
right forward post which he vacated
temporarily for Payne Palmer.
Coach Bunn was especially pleased
with the playing of both Cordry and
Moffatt on the southern journey.
Baker at guard also made a hit with
the Indian mentor by his showing
against U.C.L.A.
Outplayed Bruins
Questioned yesterday about the
play in the two Bruin games. Bunn
declared that after the first 10 min
utes of each contest the Indians
outplayed and outscored their op
ponents, but that in the opening
minutes they couldn't seem to get
going. He could not explain the
lapse but said that the men were
all angry at themselves because they
felt that they could have beaten the
Bruins. Failure to play the defense
planned for the tilts in the first 10
minutes resulted in giving U.C.L.A.
a big lead in each game.
The Cardinal coach feels, how
ever, that the defense is all right
when it plays up to standard and
does not intend to spend any con
siderable time on it this week. He
will work on the offensive depart
ment almost exclusively.
According to figures made up
from the latest scores. Captain Mike
Reynolds holds the lead among the
scorers of the squad, having tanked
the ball with sufficient frequency
to pile up a total for the season of
38 points. Phil Moffatt is hot on his
tiail with .'54, while Rintala, 2(5,
Doub, 24, and Cordry, 23, follow in
order.

trick of putting the ball in the only
place it scores any points, through
the hoop.
Shooting Workout
Working against the reserves, the
first-string men employed an infor
mal scrimmage as a mean of mas
tering a fast attack centered on the
"hole" under the basket. The work
of the guards in driving in at full
speed to take passes and spin the
casaba into the net was the chief
feature of the scrimmage.
Running on the first line com
bination were Moffatt and Cordry,
forwards; Reynolds, center; Rintala
and Fawcett, guards. Cordry's good
work in the games with U.C.L.A. ap
pears to have put him back at the
right forward post which he vacated
temporarily for Payne Palmer.
Coach Bunn was especially pleased
with the playing of both Cordry and
Moffatt on the southern journey.
Baker at guard also made a hit with
the Indian mentor by his showing
against U.C.L.A.
Outplayed Bruins
Questioned yesterday about the
play in the two Bruin games. Bunn
declared that after the first 10 min
utes of each contest the Indians
outplayed and outscored their op
ponents, but that in the opening
minutes they couldn't seem to get
going. He could not explain the
lapse but said that the men were
all angry at themselves because they
felt that they could have beaten the
Bruins. Failure to play the defense
planned for the tilts in the first 10
minutes resulted in giving U.C.L.A.
a big lead in each game.
The Cardinal coach feels, how
ever, that the defense is all right
when it plays up to standard and
does not intend to spend any con
siderable time on it this week. He
will work on the offensive depart
ment almost exclusively.
According to figures made up
from the latest scores. Captain Mike
Reynolds holds the lead among the
scorers of the squad, having tanked
the ball with sufficient frequency
to pile up a total for the season of
38 points. Phil Moffatt is hot on his
tiail with .'54, while Rintala, 2(5,
Doub, 24, and Cordry, 23, follow in
order.
Coach Bunn set out yesterday to
give the Stanford basketball varsity
an offense that will blast its way
through to the basket and sink
"sucker" shots as well as the long
tosses.
With the strong U.S.C. team in
vading the campus this coming
week-end, Bunn concentrated his
energies upon the business of teach
ing his charges the all-important
trick of putting the ball in the only
place it scores any points, through
the hoop.
