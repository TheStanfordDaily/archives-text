## Borah Urges Protection For Appointees; Senator Bingham Counters 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (/P). —
Blocked by President Hoover, the
Senate drive for removal of three
members of the new Power Com
mission marked time today as the
Senate opposition considered new
moves.
The commissioners. — Chairman
George Otis Smith, Marcel Garsaud,
and Claude L. Draper—meanwhile
went on with their duties supported
by the ruling of President Hoover
that they were legally in office.
Confidence in Hoover
Administration leaders were con
fident that Mr. Hoover was backed
by the people and they believed the
contest was ended by the President's
refusal to resubmit the nominations.
During a debate on the Tariff
Commission nominations today, Sen
ator Borah, Republican, Idaho, con
tended the executive and legislative
branches should "keep hands off"
the independent commissions after
they had been appointed.
Borah Answered
Senator Bingham, Republican,
Conecticut, countered that Borah
had voted for recall of the Power
Commission nominees after they had
been appointed. Borah replied that
he held the view the Senate had the
right under its rules to reconsider
these nominations.
The three nominations reappeared
on the Senate's calendar today as
though unconfirmed. Just what to
do about it was occupying consid
erable attention.
