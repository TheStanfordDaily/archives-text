### 
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., Jan. 12
j (/P).â€”College sports received a vig
| orous blow today from Governor
; William H. Murray, in his first mes
sage to the Oklahoma legislature,
j "The most deplorable thing of all
our educational errors is the placing
as the shibboleth and slogan of in
stitutions, the subject of 'ball play
| ing' and other sports," the governor,
"Alfalfa Bill," asserted. "It is but
' giving reward and applause for
i physical strength,"
The chief executive said he fa
-1 vored paying for sports to a limited
extent in the schools, "but when it
comes to a university paying an ag
| gregate sum of $52,000 for instruc
j tors in sports alone, not counting the
| other expenses incidental and the
expense of players, it is entirely too
much."
