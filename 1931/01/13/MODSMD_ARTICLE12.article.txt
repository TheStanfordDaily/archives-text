SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12 </P). â€”A 1
vote of the people on repeal of the
eighteenth amendment and elimina
tion of the interlocutory divorce de
cree in California were two out
standing issues reflected in legisla
tive circles here today.
Senator George Rochester of Los i
Angeles for the third time intro
duced bills in the California legisla
ture today proposing abolition of the j
interlocutory decree, thus eliminat- |
