# BARKELEW DEFEATS CLYDE FOR WOMAN TENNIS SUPREMACY
## 
### 
Patricia Barkelew yesterday af
ternoon climbed to first place on the
women's tennis ladder after trounc
ing Molly Clyde, who has held the
top rung since the ladder started in
October, 8-6, 6-1.
The ladder was organized by Miss
Gertrude Hawley, Acting Director
of Roble Gymnasium, as an active
form of competition for advanced
players. To progress up the ladder a
woman may challenge either of the
two players immediately above her
at any time, and if she carries off
the honors of the match she auto
matically assumes the higher posi
tion.
Interest in this ladder is increas
ing as more women are joining the
ranks of the contestants, and any
one may sign up at the bottom with
possibilities of advancing as rapidly
as her game permits.
