# THEATRE GUILD HIT READ HERE
## 'Green Pastures' Rendered By Blanks Tonight 
### 
"Green Pastures" by Mare Con- 1
nelly, the outstanding play of the I
past year in New York, will be read :
in the Little Theater at 7:30 o'clock
tonight by Professor Anthony F.
Blanks, associate professor of pub- ,
lie speaking at the University of j
California.
"The play is lots of fun, but very
impressive," said Professor Lee Em- '
erson Bassett of the Stanford public
speaking department. "It represents |
the Negro's idea of God and spiritual i
things. The Almighty is presented
on the stage as a man in the street,
wearing a Prince Albert coat, smok
ing cigars, and talking in a very fa
miliar and colloquial way. Never
theless, 'Green Pastures' is very dig
nified, reverent, and most impres
sive.
Play Banned in England
" 'Green Pastures' cannot be pre- 1
sented in England because of a law ,
prohibiting the characterization of!
the Almighty on the stage. The Eng- i
lish regret very much that they can- i
not see this play, which has had ,
such a great run in New York."
Marc Connelly is the author of the
play, "Merton of the Movies," which
was printed in the collection of the
best plays of 1922-23, and of "Beg
gars on Horseback," printed among (
the best plays of 1923-24. These two
comedies were written in colalbora
tion with George S. Kaufman, i
"Green Pastures," Connelly's latest
production, is based on "01' Man
Abram an' His Chilluns" by Roark
Bradford.
