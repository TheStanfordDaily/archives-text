# "NAVY BILL" TO SUCCEED PRICE AT CALIFORNIA
## Ingram To Report At U.C. By March 1 To Direct Spring Training 
### 
William "Navy Bill" Ingram will
next year attempt to do what the
late "Andy" Smith and Clarence
"Nibs" Price failed to do in the last
seven yearsâ€”beat Stanford.
Ingram was yesterday appointed
head football coach at the University
of California, the action of Califor
nia authorities confirming rumors
rife since Sunday, when announce
ment was made at Annapolis of
"Navy Bill's" resigning as grid men
tor at the United States Naval Acad
emy.
The retiring navy coach will re
port at Berkeley on March 1, in time
for spring training, according to As
sociated Press dispatches.
Signs for Three Years
Ingram has been signed for a
three-year period. Salary terms
have not been announced, but are
believed to call for between $12,000
and $15,000 yearly.
W. W. Monohan, graduate mana
ger, who signed Ingram during an
extensive "hunting trip" throughout
the Mid-West and East, had instruc
tions not to offer more than $15,000
a year.
The new Bear coach, who replaces
"Nibs" Price, who resigned after last
season, will recommend one or two
assistants.
Ingram was a star halfback and
quarterback at Navy in 1916, 1917,
and 1918. He was named Ail-Amer
ican quarterback in 1918.
Has Pacific Record
In 1919, "Navy Bill" returned to
Annapolis as first assistant to Gil
Dobie. He organized the Pacific-
Fleet team in 1920 and 1921, while
stationed in this section, and acted
as coach and player on those elevens.
Retiring from the Navy in 1922 to
enter business, Ingram accepted a
"hurry-up" call from William and
Mary College of Williamsburg, Va.,
and took over the head coaching du
ties there in September of that year.
From 1923 to 1925, he coached at
the University of Indiana and in
1926 came back to Annapolis as head
coach. As leader of the Navy squads,
his teams won 32 games, lost 13, and
tied 4 in the last five vears.
