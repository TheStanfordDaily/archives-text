# DISHONESTY BRINGS DISASTER
## 
### 
Stanford's honor code is being enforced. Six freshman stu
dents three men and three women, learned this vesterdav when
sentences were meted out to them by the Men's and Women's Coun
cils for violations of the code.
Dishonesty in final examinations last quarter, brought to the
attention of the councils and confirmed by the violators, resulted
in the six students being failed in the courses concerned. In addi
tion, they were placed on probation for the remainder of their col
lege careers.
Stanford's honor code is a contract of the students with them
selves. "that they will not give or receive aid in examinations: that
they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the
preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be used bv
the instructor as the basis of grading. . . The code demands onlv
one thing of the studentsâ€”intellectual honesty.
Those students who have not the common decency to play
square with themselves and with their fellow class members and
who have not the courage to behave as befits university men and
women are deservedly punished by Stanford's student control
bodies.
