Inactivity and apparent indifference of the Inter fraternity
Hoard of Control perhaps the biggest obstacle in the path of
solving the Stanford fraternity housing problem.
This body, which is composed of alumni, faculty, and under
graduate members, is the one medium through which campus fra
lernities may meet with Cniversity authorities in a housing confer
ence. Instead of actively promoting a better housing program, which
i> unquestionably the biggest problem now facing fraternities, the
Hoard has met but once 1 his school year, and that meeting took
place last September. \ot even a committee on housing has been
appointed.
According to one member of the Tnterfraternity Hoard, certain
rooming houses in I'alo Alto, which arc said to be in far better
repair than many fraternity houses, have been scratched from the
I nivcrsity's list of approved dwellings because the accommodations
filtered were considered too poor. Hut the Hoard does nothing to
improve fraternity housing conditions. Their inactivity blocks
everyone else, since the Hoard is the onlv body empowered to act
for the whole fraternity group.
With dwellings outworn, sanitary and fire conditions admittedly
bad, and overcrowding not uncommon, inactivity on the part of
Intcrfraternity Hoard amounts to criminal negligence.
Stanford fraternity chapters have in the Hoard the necessarv
organization to handle the problem. The personnel of the Hoard
i.s competent. Extreme pressure should be exerted by each local
chapter to force action.
