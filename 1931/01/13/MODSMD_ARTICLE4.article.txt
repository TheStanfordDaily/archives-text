## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 12. M>|â€”Bernard
Shaw has not changed his mind
about visiting the United States and
today he issued a denial of reports
that he would go there in the au
tumn.
"For thirty years," he said,
"something like this has been said
three times a year and contradicted."
He is only 74, however, so there
is still plenty of lime for him 1o
cross the Atlantic.
