MISS MOLE. By E. 11. Young, liar" j
court, Brace. New York 1930. (At
tiie Palo Alto Book Shop.)
i ' In this day of somewhat sordid
■ realism, it is a relief to find an oc
i ccsional novel which might be Jane
i Austen's or Thackeray's ''great
-1 grandchild"—one which is modern,
i but doesn't boast about it with a
| superior and well-practiced swag
ger.
Such is "Miss Mole," s person
! "unaffected by opinion," renting her
poor little piece of land, with its j
j cottage, to her "wounded war hero," ;
who only promised to pay the rent, !
and living as housekeeper with
1 Robert Corder's family. Her cool !
! genius at seeing people and things
exactly as they were, gained the
I confidence and respect that pierced
j her own shadow and saw the per
| son.
The descriptive powers of the au
thor, while guod in themselves, are
I tedious at times, and the ending
j slips a bit into mediocrity, but the
: subtlety of keeping a moderate sus
i pense while allowing ample appre- \
| ciation of what makes it suspense
! and the admitttance of human foi
j bles without a stream-of-conscious j

dwelling on them, is so cleverly pre
sented thut Miss Mole becomes a
character worth knowing. —J. N.
CINDERELLA'S DAUGHTER. Ry
John Erskine. Bobbs-MerrilJ, In
dianapolis, 1930. (At the Palo Alto
Hook Shop.)
In his own characteristic style,
John Erskine proceeds to explode
the lew remaining illusions created
by fairy tales. He is not content, to
leave Cinderella living "happily
ever after," Griselda backing in the
essence of patience, Lady Godiva
forever respected and loved for her
noble sacrifice. He prefers to intro
duce modern logic into the tales,
showing us that legends are sur
prisingly true to life everywhere at
any time —if a little common sense
be: applied to them.
Erskine's "common sense," of
course, masquerades as satire on
both the legends themselves and
contemporary conventions.
Unless one is an ardent admirer
of Erskine, one or two of his stories
are enough. Of those in the collec
tion entitled "Cinderella's Daugh
ter," "Conversion" is easily the best,
with "After-Thoughts of Lady Go
diva" second. —J. N.

forever respected and loved for her
noble sacrifice. He prefers to intro
duce modern logic into the tales,
showing us that legends are sur
prisingly true to life everywhere at
any time —if a little common sense

Erskine's "common sense," of
course, masquerades as satire on
both the legends themselves and
contemporary conventions.
Unless one is an ardent admirer
of Erskine, one or two of his stories
are enough. Of those in the collec

ter," "Conversion" is easily the best,
with "After-Thoughts of Lady Go
diva" second. —J. N.

i ' In this day of somewhat sordid
■ realism, it is a relief to find an oc
i ccsional novel which might be Jane
i Austen's or Thackeray's ''great
-1 grandchild"—one which is modern,
i but doesn't boast about it with a
| superior and well-practiced swag
ger.
Such is "Miss Mole," s person
! "unaffected by opinion," renting her
poor little piece of land, with its j
j cottage, to her "wounded war hero," ;
who only promised to pay the rent, !
and living as housekeeper with
1 Robert Corder's family. Her cool !
! genius at seeing people and things
exactly as they were, gained the
I confidence and respect that pierced
j her own shadow and saw the per
| son.
The descriptive powers of the au
thor, while guod in themselves, are
I tedious at times, and the ending
j slips a bit into mediocrity, but the
: subtlety of keeping a moderate sus
i pense while allowing ample appre- \
| ciation of what makes it suspense
! and the admitttance of human foi
j bles without a stream-of-conscious j

dwelling on them, is so cleverly pre
sented thut Miss Mole becomes a
character worth knowing. —J. N.
