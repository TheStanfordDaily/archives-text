Proving that everything the world j
thinks worth while is on the sur- 1
! face, Quad i.s becoming a fashion
| center for the college elite. Inci-
I dental to the rise in fur coat traffic 1
comes a noticeable improvement in
dispositions. Ail 475 of Ihem in

the haughtiest of them all has been

We're told that with winter
weather more women take to
outdoor sports, and that even
with the honor code working
overtime they register for
j courses that never meet when
I it rains. So we have discussion
courses in Physical Education.
Iva Feelin. that hlonde sopho
more we told you about (he !
other day, just confided 111 us
that she always thought the
"Sermon on the Mount"' was a
lecture in equitation. (It won't
be long, now!)
I Cabbages has never gone in for i
i charity on a large scale, but today ;

we're sobbing on your shoulders, [
begging contributions - for a most j
worthy cause. It's for the poor little 1
Phi Delts, fellows. Let's all chip in
and buy them a curtain to hide the
inharmonious red lantern in one of
their second-fioor windows. Any
thing at all will help. Save your
cigarette coupons and tinfoil wrap- j
pings. Save anything at all, but give
'em a hand! Such poverty must be
preserved from the public gaze.
(Thanks to our old friend Chappie
for that phrase!)
It's been weeks since we've given
you one of our interestingly educa
tional lectures about the world-at
large. Today we have concentrated
into two short paragraphs all the !
things you ought to know about
Switzerland, our little neighbor
across the Alps.
The chief products of Switzer
land, in the first placc, are
yodels, cheese, cuckoo clocks,
chocolate, and hotel keepers.
It is an interesting sociological,
philological, parenthetical, peripa
tetic, and epileptic fact that four |
out of every five of the inhabitants j
succum to pyorrhea.
