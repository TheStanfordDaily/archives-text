## A 						POET PLEADS FOR PASSION

My song, sweetheart, may be un
couth,
And yet I love you truly;
Does my impasioned voice of youth ;
Seem to entreat unduly?
I want your love: Oh, can't you see i
I can't go on without it?
For if you grant not that to me,
How can I sing about it?
And if in any songs of mine
My voice may fail and falter,
Remember, that is but a sign
Of something you can alter.
For every pleasure shared by us, j
My songs would be the sweeter; ,
But if you must evade me thus,
Don't gripe about the meter.
