### 
DETROIT, Jan. 12 (/P).—Detroit's
job-bound industrial army was aug
mented today by 70,000 or more men
who were called back to their
benches and assembly lines after
several weeks of inactivity.
Most of the re-employment was
accounted for at the Rouge plant of
the Ford Motor Company, which
had been idle since an inventory
shut-down on December 18, with the
exception of the employment of
about G,500 men on a part-time basis
last week. The Ford company for
several months has been operating
three days a week, eight hours a
day, and the lack of an announced
change from this policy indicated
that it is to be continued. The com
pany announced that the employees
recalled today brought the total at
the Rouge plant to 75,000. while 32.-
000 others were ordered back to
work in other parts of the country.
Increased activity at several other
automobile plants also was reported.
The Buick Motor Car Company at
Flint brought its total to 13,500 with
recall of 1,700 men. The Cadillac
Motor Car Company, operating five
seven-hour days a week, reported a
normal force of 6,000. The Chevrolet
Motor Company, working two shifts,
has 32,000 men on a 32-hour-a-week
basis.
The return of the men to work
brought additional pay to several
hundred employees of the street car
system, as extra cars were operated
on lines to the factories.
