## Flyers, Due Sunday, Are Believed Forced Into Sea 
### 
HORTA, ISLAND OF FAYAL,
AZORES, Jan. 12. (/P)—Hope that
the transatlantic "payload" aviators,
1 Mrs. Beryl Hart and Lieutenant
William S. MacLaren, were still alive
was virtually abandoned tonight.
Not a word or a sign of them had
been received since they took off
from Hamilton, Bermuda, at 11:15
o'clock Saturday morning for Horta
on the second lap of their flight in
the monoplane Tradewind from New
York to Paris.
Strong winds and high seas have
prevailed since that time and it was
feared that had they been forced
down their frail machine could have
withstood J.he seas only a few min
utes. They had expected to take 21
hours for the flight and were due
here at 3:15 o'clock Sunday morn
ing.
Watchers Withdraw
Tonight, indicative of the fear that
j they were lost, gasoline supplies
which had been kept on a scow in
(he harbor in readiness for refuel
ing, were withdrawn. There was
; still a possibility they had been
forced to come down near one of
j the small, uninhabited islands of the
Azores group or had been picked up
| by some vessel not equipped with
wireless. This possibility was a for
lorn one, however, and little hope
was felt in that quarter.
