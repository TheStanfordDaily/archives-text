# Yearling Hoopsters Face Stockton High Tonight
## BUNN DRILLS MEN ON ERRORS SHOWN IN GREY FOG TILT Game Slated At 8 O'Clock In Pavilion; Regular Line-up Planned 
### Lowell Cox 
With but one day's practice in j
which to smooth up the play of the j
freshman quintet since Saturday's j
ragged San Francisco University j
game, Coach John Bunn will send j
the yearlings against the Stockton ;
high-school five tonight at 8 o'clock j
in the Pavilion.
This contest is expected to give :
some idea of the relative strength j
of the Stanford babes and the CJni- j
versity of California first-year men. i
The latter trounced Stockton, 41) to !
IS, in a preliminary to the Trojan j
game Saturday.
Fast Breaking Drilled
Coach Bunn spent most of yester- |
day's practice drilling the frosh on j
fast breaking, a department of the j
game they apparently forgot all {
about in the Grey Fog tilt.
Although showing great improve- .
ment in shooting during this game, j
their floor work was much below ,
ihe standard they set for themselves i
in earlier contests.
Bunn expects to start the regular j
line-up of Topping and Massey, for- |
wards, Packard, center, and Wright |
and Smith, guards. Should this j
combination fail to "click" properly, j
however, the Indian coach will un- !
doubtedly give Panero and others a \
chance.
Stockton Team Strong
Stockton usually produces one of j
the strongest prep basketball teams j
in the Sacramento Valley, and in i
spite of their decisive loss to the :
Bear frosh, Coach Pete Lenz's live |
can be expected to put up a hard j
game.
This wil Ibe a busy week for the
Cardinal yearlings, as they will play
preliminaries to the Trojan games
on Friday and Saturday nights. I
Menlo Junior College will furnish
the opposition Friday.
