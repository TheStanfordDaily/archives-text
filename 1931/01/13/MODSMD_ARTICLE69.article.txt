# THE 						CROWN PRINCE AGAIN
## Despite Injuries, Swat Peer Missed American League Baiting Crown by Scant Two Points in 1930 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Not so long ago a big ball player '
| was discharged from a New York
| hospital after being operated on for
| a splintered elbow and a dislocated i
! finger. Yet, in spite of those ail
; ments in 1930, he was able to come
! within two points of leading the
! American League in batting and to
| blast out forty-two doubles, seven
i teen triples, and forty-one home
rune. He also batted in 174 runs, to
i lead the league (and came within
| one of his own record made in
; 1927), and his total of 419 bases also
i was high mark for the younger cir
! cuit.
That is what Lou Gehrig, big first
sacker of the Yankees, did in 1930,
and now that he has had a few
repairs made on his system there is
|no telling what he'll do in 1931. I
I Lou's fine record for last season was
: a kick in the pants to those calamity
howlers who insisted that he was
! already on the down grade, after a
| disastrous (for him) year in 1929
when he barely hit .300, a slump of
seventy-four points over his mark
of 1928.
Gehrig's Highest Mark
Gehrig's batting mark of the "year
j of depression" was the highest he ,
had ever made, and he kept on his ,

terrific home run gait that has won
him a place among the leading cir
cuit clout manufacturers in the ma
jor leagues. His forty-one homers
of 1930 added 1o his 146 of the pre
vious five seasons make his lifetime
major league home run average bet
ter than thirty-one a season!
Larrupin' Lou achieved other
fame during the year just closed.
He hit three homers in one game
and twice tied the record of driving
in eight runs in a single contest.
Besides that, he scored 143 tallies,
tying for third in that respect, struck
out sixty-three times, got 101 bases
on balls, and was hit by the pitclier
three times. And bear in mind that
Henry Louis Gehrig is not yet
twenty-eight and should have ten
good years of heavy slugging ahead
of him.
''Babe" Aging
Ruth, nearly ten years older, is
nearing the end of his career. But
while these two Sultans of Swat
are in there together, they are a
whole show in themselves and if
you've never seen their act, don't
fail to go to see the two in action
if you ever get the chance. There's
something colossal about the way
these two hit a baseball.

him a place among the leading cir
cuit clout manufacturers in the ma
jor leagues. His forty-one homers
of 1930 added 1o his 146 of the pre
vious five seasons make his lifetime
major league home run average bet
ter than thirty-one a season!
Larrupin' Lou achieved other
fame during the year just closed.
He hit three homers in one game
and twice tied the record of driving
in eight runs in a single contest.
Besides that, he scored 143 tallies,
tying for third in that respect, struck
out sixty-three times, got 101 bases
on balls, and was hit by the pitclier
three times. And bear in mind that
Henry Louis Gehrig is not yet
twenty-eight and should have ten
good years of heavy slugging ahead
of him.
''Babe" Aging
Ruth, nearly ten years older, is
nearing the end of his career. But
while these two Sultans of Swat
are in there together, they are a
whole show in themselves and if
you've never seen their act, don't
fail to go to see the two in action
if you ever get the chance. There's
something colossal about the way
these two hit a baseball.

Not so long ago a big ball player '
| was discharged from a New York
| hospital after being operated on for
| a splintered elbow and a dislocated i
! finger. Yet, in spite of those ail
; ments in 1930, he was able to come
! within two points of leading the
! American League in batting and to
| blast out forty-two doubles, seven
i teen triples, and forty-one home
rune. He also batted in 174 runs, to
i lead the league (and came within
| one of his own record made in
; 1927), and his total of 419 bases also
i was high mark for the younger cir
! cuit.
That is what Lou Gehrig, big first
sacker of the Yankees, did in 1930,
and now that he has had a few
repairs made on his system there is
|no telling what he'll do in 1931. I
I Lou's fine record for last season was
: a kick in the pants to those calamity
howlers who insisted that he was
! already on the down grade, after a
| disastrous (for him) year in 1929
when he barely hit .300, a slump of
seventy-four points over his mark
of 1928.
Gehrig's Highest Mark
Gehrig's batting mark of the "year
j of depression" was the highest he ,
had ever made, and he kept on his ,

terrific home run gait that has won
him a place among the leading cir
cuit clout manufacturers in the ma
