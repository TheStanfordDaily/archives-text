# STANFORD FLYING CLUB GETS STATE CHARTER, AIRSHIP
## Organization Gives Indians Beginning In Possible College Sport 
### 
Circling far up in the sky, the j
drone of a plane announces that ]
Stanford again leads the way in col- :
legiate sport. Yale uses a borrowed j
ship, U.C.L.A. builds a makeshift :
j glider, but Stanford is actually on j
| the wing.
The Stanford Flying Club be- J
| came a real organization with the 1
recent delivery of its Travelair bi- j
plane, and the acknowledgment of 1
its charter from Sacramento.
Four of the club's seven members |
are practicing solo flight in the j
plane. The rest take dual instruc- ;
tion and ground school at the Palo ;
Alto School of Aviation.
The envy of the groundlings and
the best wishes oFthe campus fol
| low the flyers, who may be laying
i the foundation for a new kind of j
i intercollegiate sport.
Ten years may find Stanford rac
ing California and stunting Yale,
i with a transatlantic entry from Ox
| ford. Meanwhile, the color of the
i first Stanford plane is blue and gold,
I and club members hope that no one
will take a pot-shot at it before
they have time to paint it cardinal.
Limited to 10 members, the Club
is still open to a few of the more ad
venturous and physically fit of the
campus. Ried Bogert, Janet Briggs,
and Dan Woodyatt are club officers.
