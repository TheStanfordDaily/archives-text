# TRANSFUSION HAS NOT HARMED PATTY BAKER
## 
### 
Patty Baker, '32, in the Palo Alto
Hospital convalescing from an at
tack of poliomyelitis, is progressing
satisfactorily, hospital attendants
said last night.
Miss Baker recently underwent an
operation in which she gave a pint
of her own blood to Mrs. A. A.
Tucker of Redwood City, who was
brought to the hospital last week
suffering from the same disease.
Those in charge of Miss Baker said
that the loss of blood had not ma
terially affected the patient's con
dition and that she is resting easily.
