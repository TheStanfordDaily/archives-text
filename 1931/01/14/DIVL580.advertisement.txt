on those castings
Even though it was July 4 and a
holiday, R. T. Crane, then a young
man, was so eager to see his tiny new
foundry in actual operation that he
lighted the furnace, filled the crucible
with metal, and poured his first cast
ings. When the moulds were cool,
and the first Crane products ready,
he studied and cleaned and polished
with inexhaustible care.
The little foundry has grown into the
347 acres of Crane manufacturing
plants. Progress has brought rows
of giant electric furnaces to take the
place of his first crude one. The light
ning rod couplings that he made on
that day in 1 8 5 5 have been expanded
into a line of 33,000 items, meeting
every modern valve and fitting need
of the world's industries. J>ut to this
day, the example the founder set of
intense personal interest and pride
and care for the quality of each prod
uct remains a distinguishing mark
of the Crane organization.
Just as the founder on that first day
felt that his future rested with the
quality of those couplings, Crane men
are trained to feel that their company's
reputation rests upon the quality of
each valve and fitting they turn out.
