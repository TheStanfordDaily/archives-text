At Illinois it's^
ALONG Green Street, where
campus leaders stroll ... in
the great slate-roofed fraternity
houses of Champaign . . . there is
one pipe tobacco which always rolls
up the biggest vote. At Illinois it's
Edgeworth, every time.
A pipe—Edgeworth. That, is the
smoking combination which lias
won the college man. Harvard,
Cornell, Michigan, Stanford, Dart-
L mouth — all agree with Illinois.
Natural merit has made Edgeworth
the favorite tobacco in America's
leading colleges and universities.
College men everywhere respond
to the appeal of pipes—packed with
cool, slow-burning Edgeworth. Be
guided by their verdict: try Edge
worth yourself. Find it at your
nearest tobacco shop— the tin.
