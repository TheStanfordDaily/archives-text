# Personal Phases Treated In State Legislative Work
## Radio, Liquor, Divorce, Unemployment Considered in Many Proposals To Be Prepared for Submission At Current Session of Legislature PROHIBITION QUESTION BECOMING LIVE ISSUE 
### 
LJACRAMENTO, Jan. IX (/P) â€”The more personal phases of modern life,
liquor, the radio, unemployment, divorce, and old age pensions, are
to gain consideration of the California legislature. Legislation covering
these subjects was either being prepared today or already on the books j
of the Senate and Assembly. Political attacks broadcast by radio may
prove costly to the atacker if the legislature considers favorably the bill
Governor Rolph has been given for introduction, making it possible for

the victim to file a radio slander
suit in his own county.
Under the present law a victim
of radio slander must file suit in
the county where the offending sta
tion is located. The Governor is un
derstood to be favorably inclined
toward the measure prepared for his
approval and introduction.
The prohibition question is be
coming a live issue in the legisla
ture. Senator Tallant Tubbs has in
troduced a resolution memorializing
Congress to repeal the Eighteenth
Amendment. Senator Thomas Ma
loney and Assemblyman William
Horn blower think the people and
not the legislature should petition
Congress, so they are preparing a
resolution proposing to place a pro
hibition referendum on the next
general election ballot.
Dr. A. H. Briggs, state superin
tendent of the Anti-Saloon League,
and Ben Geis, attorney for the drys,
were visitors at the capitol yester
day and were understood to have
been told their organized forces
must shoulder the burden of defeat
ing any wet legislation introduced
in the legislature.
