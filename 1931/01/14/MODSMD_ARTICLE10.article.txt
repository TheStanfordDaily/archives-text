# Johns Hopkins To Drop Credit Plan Of Grading
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Jan. 13. </P) â€” The |
American college custom of grading
and graduating students by totaling
the number of points awarded for j
attending certain classes and pass
ing certain examinations is to be
dropped by Johns Hopkins Univer
sity, it was announced today.
The new plan, which provides that
an undergraduate student shall ma
jor in a specific subject at the end 1
of his sophomore year, is based on
the so-called Oilman plan in use at 1
the university from its founding
until a decade ago. It is to become '
effective in 1932. ,
New Plan Described
A set of comprehensive examina
tions in the spring of the year in
which the student presents himself
for a degree is provided but other
wise the* daily grind of the student
will not be affected to a major de
gree. for there will be course exam
inations also.
The traditional system of award- i
ing credits, said an announcement,

"gives the student the idea that
once a course is ended it is absolved
and may be forgotten."
Because of the credit system, it
was said, students are permitted to
take any courses so long as the re
quirements have been filled, and as
a consequence they are graduated
"with a heterogenous collection of
information which is bound to be
superficial."
Heterogeneity Avoided
Under the new plan, the student
will bo compelled to take courses
in conjunction with the subject to
which he devotes his major atten
tion. A tentative grouping puts un
dergraduate subject matter in the
general classifications of laboratory
science and logic; social science and
ethics; and literature and language.
"The proposal plans to do away
with the heterogenousness of the
subject matter and to insist that a
student shall know something about
Ins own and closely related sub
jects," it was explained.
