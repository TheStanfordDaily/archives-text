# GREEKS TO ATTACK HOUSE PROBLEMS ON CAMPUS-GRANT
## Situation Presents Enigma To Both Fraternities And Authorities 
### 
Fraternity housing problems on I
! the campus will be attacked imme- !
, diately from the Greek standpoint, ;
' stated Richard Grant, president, at
; last night's meeting of the Interfra
j ternity Council. j
"Housing facilities present a mam
moth problem to both the fraterni
! ties and the University administra- i
s tion," Grant said. "Alumni associa- 1
tions are unwilling to erect houses
| which must be turned over to Uni
i versity ownership, and a suitable 1
; building program appears to be
1 much too costly for the University
! to undertake."
Next Tuesday evening the mem
bers of the Interfraternity Board of
j Control and the various house presi
i dents will meet at dinner with Dr.
Robert E. Swain, acting-president j
of the University, where the build
ing problem will probably be dis
| cussed, Grant announced. He re
ported that the building plans of I
Duke and Northwestern Universi
' ties, the two most successful sys
i tems in operation, have been col
lected for examination. These plans I
indicate that a building plan on this j
: campus could be effected at a mini
mum cost of §2,000,000.
Wallace Butler and Frank Booth
were elected to the Interfraternity
Board of Control to replace John
Hunken and Alan McDermott, 1
whose terms have expired.
Plans for an interfraternity dance,
similar to that held last year, were
j discussed, but no decision was j
reached. Grant gave a brief report
of the National Interfraternity Con
ference held in New York City last
, December, to which he was the
! Stanford delegate. He reported that |
i hell week initiation ceremonies, one I
' of the major subjects considered at
; the conference, was characterized as
obsolete and ridiculous.
