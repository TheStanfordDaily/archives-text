smaller communities over 21 states
during this winter.
Increase Needed
"Within the last ten days the Red
Cross has had to increase the rate
of expenditures to an amount great
er than during the entire preceding
four months.
"The American Red Cross is the
Nation's sole agency for relief in
such a crisis. It is meeting the de
mand and must continue to do so
during the remainder of the winter.
"The disaster reserve of the Red
Cross which was pledged to this
emergency last August is not suf
ficient to meet the increased de
mands.
Red Cross Offers Aid
"It is imperative in the view of
the experienced directors of the Red
Cross that a minimum of at least
$10,000,000 be contributed to carry
the relief program to completion.
"As President of the United Slates
and as President of the American
Pled Cross, I, therefore, appeal to
our people to contribute promptly
and most generously in order that
the suffering of thousands of our
fellow countx-ymen may be pre
vented.
"I am doing so with the supreme
confidence that in the face of this
great humanitarian need your re
sponse will be immediate.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. (/P/fhe House liauled the Drought Loan Fund
Appropriation Bill today from the legislative hog in which it has
floundered for days and sent it on to conference still burdened with
dissension. Almost simultaneously President Hoover issued a proclama
tion calling upon the public for $10,000,000 to be expended by the Ited
Cross in buying food and clothing for the sufferers of the drought area.

Conflict Aroused
Sharp-spoken conflict surrounded
the action of the House. This pivoted
on the Senate amendment increas
ing the bill's total from $45,000,000
to $t>0,000,000, by the addition of a
fund with which farmers would be
authorized to buy food for them
selves and their families.
The President's proclamation fol
lows:
"To My Fellowcountrymen:
"There must be a very material
increase in the resources of the
American Red Cross to enable it to
bear the burden which it has under
taken in the drought area and
smaller communities over 21 states
during this winter.
Increase Needed
"Within the last ten days the Red
Cross has had to increase the rate
of expenditures to an amount great
er than during the entire preceding
four months.
"The American Red Cross is the
Nation's sole agency for relief in
such a crisis. It is meeting the de
mand and must continue to do so
during the remainder of the winter.
"The disaster reserve of the Red
Cross which was pledged to this
emergency last August is not suf
ficient to meet the increased de
mands.
Red Cross Offers Aid
"It is imperative in the view of
the experienced directors of the Red
Cross that a minimum of at least
$10,000,000 be contributed to carry
the relief program to completion.
"As President of the United Slates
and as President of the American
Pled Cross, I, therefore, appeal to
our people to contribute promptly
and most generously in order that
the suffering of thousands of our
fellow countx-ymen may be pre
vented.
"I am doing so with the supreme
confidence that in the face of this
great humanitarian need your re
sponse will be immediate.
"Signed: Herbert Hoover."
