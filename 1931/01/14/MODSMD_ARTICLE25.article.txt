# Presentation Of Green Pastures Pleases Hearers
## Interpretation Of Negro Beliefs Delightful 
### 
An audience which overflowed the
Little Theatre last night enjoyed the
delightful interpretation of the sim
ple religious beliefs of the southern
negro, as shown in selected portions
from Marc Connelly's "Green Pas
tures." The Pulitzer prize-winning
play, read by Professor Anthony F.
Blanks, associate professor of Public
Speaking at the University of Cali
fornia, proved to be one of the most
popular presentations of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises this year.
In a short introduction, Professor
Blanks told several anecdotes of his
own experience with negroes on his
plantation in the South, where he
lived throughout his boyhood.
'A deep religious tone underlies
the whole play, which must be ac
cepted with the simple credulity of
the negro. In "01' Man Abram an'
His Chilluns," the book from which
the stage presentation was taken,
Roark Bradford caught the simple,
natural spirit of the Southern ne
groes with whom he had associated
all his life, and the genius of Marc
Connelly has given us the same
color in the play."
For the first time in the modern
drama, God is represented as an
actual person, living and walking
about on the stage, associating with
his people, according to the mental
conception of the negroes of whom
it was written.
