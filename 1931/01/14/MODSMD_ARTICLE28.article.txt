# Peace Union Secretary Claims Newspaper Hoax
## 
### 
Emphatically denying that she
had directed an attack against the
Stanford military science depart
ment deploring the militaristic at
mosphere on the campus, Mrs. Alice
Park, secretary of the Palo Alto
Women's Peace Union, last night
told the Daily that she believed she
was the "victim of a very clever
newspaper hoax."
Mrs. Park had been quoted by a
San Francisco daily as attacking
Dean Donald C. Cubbison and Cap
tain Ittai Luke of the military sci
ence department for the presence oi
"too much militarism on the Stan
ford campus." There followed sev
eral specific conditions which Mrs.
Park, the article said, violently op
posed. They included the opportun
ity for women students to handle
rifles on the target range and the
keeping of ordnance pieces across
the way from the Memorial Chapel,
"supposedly dedicated to thoughts
of peace.

i Mrs. Park said last night the
statements attributed to her were
made by a youth who had visited
her on Monday, representing him
self as William Brown, a freshman
student here, registered from
Marysville. According to Mrs. Park,
Brown said he was interested in
the efforts to stamp out militarism,
and pointed out to her the warlike
conditions which she was quoted as
attacking. He did not, she said, re
veal himself as a representative of
any newspaper. There is no Wil
liam Brown of Marysville in the
freshman clas, investigation re
vealed.
Although Mrs. Park did not deny
the fact that she does consider the
atmosphere of the campus "too
militaristic." she did disclaim re
sponsibility for all the statements
the article attributed to her. She
does not know either Dean Cubbison
or Captain Luke, she said, and she
is not contemplating any campaign
against them.
