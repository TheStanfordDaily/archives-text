# ANOTHER MOSES
## 
### 
After two months of rumors, whispers, and tips "from some
one close to official sources." the Merkeley coaching mysterv has
linally heen settled with the announcement that "Xavy Mill" Ingram
will take over the reins of football mentor recently surrendered by
< larence "Nibs" I 'rice.
The I'niversity of California, fraught with factions and numer
ous self-appointed critics —all driven by an almost fanatical desire
to turn out a championship team, may not prove to be as easy a
berth as was Annapolis. Some predict that Ingram will be forced
to employ all of the hard headedness of the traditional Xavv goat
in be successful in his new place.
Ingram now joins the ranks of "IV>p" Warner, Howard Jones,
"Doc" Spears, and Jimmy I'helan —all men who established their
coaching reputations in the Past and have recently migrated West
to make the Pacific Coast Conference one of the finest football cir
i uits in the nation.
The West Coast, and Stanford'too. wish success to "Xavy Mill."
\ ictorics. when too one-sided, sometimes lose their flavor.
