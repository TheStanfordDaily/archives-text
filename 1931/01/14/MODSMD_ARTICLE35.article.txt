# DROP THE "BIG BUSINESS"
## 
### 
Over-emphasis of college athletics was scored again, this time!
in Oklahoma, in Coventor William 11. Murray's opening message to
the state legislature. The giving of "reward and applause for
physical strength" he branded as the most deplorable of "all our
educational errors."
Kut it was the expense of college sports, an expense which he ,
believes is unnecessarily great, at which he directed bis attack.
The governor (he's known as "Alfalfa Mill" to his friends) i
favors paying for school athletics to a limited degree but feels
"when it comes to a university expending an aggregate sum of'
552,000 for instructors in sports alone, not counting the other ex-1
peiises incidental, it is entirely too much."
If the athletic revenues at this university are not sufficient to j
meet the sports outlay, the governor is justified in objecting. i
College athletic activities, in the many instances where they are I
operated in the "big business" manner of major league baseball !
clubs, can warrant their existence only when they are self-support-j
ing. If in < )klahoma "big business" college sports exist without "big,
business" financial returns pouring into the university coffers, it is'
time the "big business" is done awa\ with, leaving only the college;
sports.
