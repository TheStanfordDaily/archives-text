# JUST A LITTLE ROOM

In the daily rush to classes, campus motorists who disorderly 1
park their cars in the areas adjacent to the Library have blockaded j
the roads leading out to such an extent that it is impossible to re- ;
move cars parked early in the morning.
Students attending early morning courses have been forced to
wait while those fortunate enough to have later classes leturn from i
class and remove their cars.
()rderlv rows of automobiles with sufficient space between them !
would Ik.* the ideal arrangement at the Library parking areas.
To obtain this orderliness it would require the co-operation of |
every student. Consideration for the other fellow's car would be '
necessary, and care would have to be taken to see that the car '
ahead, behind.-or to the side had ample clearance.
