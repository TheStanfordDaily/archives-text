Ii certainly seems as though, in a big. wealthy, systematic conn- j
try siu'li as America, with a commission for practically everything, I
something could he done hi the matter of foolish greetings. No, not
postcards although a commission might easily he devoted to comic
valentines and dripping Christmas cards—hut mere salutations.
Von meet, let ns say, a friend, or possibly an acquaintance, upon j
the campus. After making sure that he sees you and is going to!
speak, you hazard a "Jlello,'' or a ''Howdy." And what does he
do, after returning the greeting? lie retorts snappily, "Mow they
going, hoy?" It catches you off guard, lie is past you, and you
feel that you must answer him. so you shout hack over your shoul
der that you are swell, and how is he? I Jut he isn't listening, not
having either expected or desired an answer, and ten to one you
crash into somebody before you get headed around again.
There are tnrec inane forms of greeting which are in common |
use. and for none of them is there an adequate answer. "Wotsa 1
good word?" is probably the least answerable and the most stupid.
Then comes "Wadda ya know, bo?" which is another hot one to
handle. And even "How are they going?" is only a blank question. 1
Why not everyone just say, "Ah, there!" with a Wodchousian
air. and let the matter rest. — Ohin State Lantern.
