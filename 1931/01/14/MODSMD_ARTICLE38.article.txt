j PORTRAIT BY CAItOLIMC. By
I Syhia Thompson. Little, Brown
Co. Boston I!Kli. (At the Palo Alto
Book Store.)
Sylvia Thompson's latest novel is
| a fascinating character study of a
1 highly interesting woman, Caroline
i Vernon. Silhouetted on a well-
I drawn background of English life,
the personality of Caroline stands
out with force and reality.
The plot, of "Portrait By Caroline"
I is practically negligible, but is suf
! ficient as an excuse for the creation
of Caroline herself. One first meets
her as the contented wife of a doc
| tor, and one leaves her much the
| same. However, in the short space
I of several hundred pages, and a
j year's elapse of time, Miss Thomp
i son introduces us to a very live
j person.
While "Portrait By Caroline" is
I not a great book, it is excellently
written. The atmosphere of English
! country life is tangibly created, the
! dialogue is entertaining, and above
' all, the book never becomes tirc
i some reading. —N. J.
UGHTNIN I —At the Varsity Theatre.
Here we have will Rogers, in the
' cinemization of the well-known
play, "Lightnin 1 ," It is a decided
let-down in his talking picture
! career. He is the old loafer that
I turns out hero. He fixes things up
with quarrelsome married couples.
He peeks around corners and looks
; "cute" at his wife. He rambles
I through a weary plot involving
Reno divorce courts, a California-
Nevada border-line hotel, a wicked
lumber company trying to get the

! valuable land for bum stock, and a
j sad little love interest.
I The supporting cast is weak; the
, recording is poor; even the Lake
I Tahoe photography looks like a
Jimes Fitzpatrick travelogue. A bor
i ing evening, and a very great dis
i appointment, Mr. Rogers and Mr.
I Fox, or whoever is responsible.

THE CIVILIZATION OF THE
RENAISSANCE. By Jas. Westfall
Thompson, George llowley, George
Sarton, and Ferdinand Schevill.
University of Chicago Press, I!).'{().
Seldom has an important historical
| period been set forth so completely
and briefly as in this series of four
lectures given at Holyoke College.
The Renaissance, properly speak
i ing, was not a re-birth, but a re
revival, a second surge of the middle
! ages, or as John Addington Symonds
i said, "the middle ages in dissolu
tion." It was the stored-up passions
; of a thousand years in magnificent
back-wash.
The middle ages looked upon
Heaven. The Renaissance discovered
1 the world. For the first time since
| the Greeks, men looked upon the
; world and saw that it was good. The
j Renaissance was Today without the
1 machine.
Dazzling as was the high-noon of
: the Renaissance, let slow men re-
I member John of Montecorvino toil—
j ing in China as archbishop of Kam
, balik (Peking), and the shadowy
figure of Cimabue standing with
I patronizing hand upon the shoul
| ders of Leonardo and Raphael.
