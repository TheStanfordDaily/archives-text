# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Thanks many times, fellow citi
zens and hangers-on' Cabbages sent
out a plea for a worthwhile cause,
j and all Stanford (at least thirteen
j people) sent assistance of one sort
| or another to the needy Phi Delts.
Contributions include seven 25-
i cent beer checks (good in Butte,
| Montana), a one-dollar bill (dam
| aged), two plugged nickels, two
! five-cent beer checks (good in any
telephone), three Canadian pennies,
| one American penny (likewise dam
i aged), one slug that looks like a
; dime, and one piece of spineless tin
j foil (the only one we really asked
| for, you remember).
After charity begins at home, then
where does it go?

Here's an announcement we'd like
to see some bright morning, in the
Daily. How does it suit you all?
"Men's Council announces that
A Certain Professor has been
found guilty of repeated and
persistent humming fo cigarettes

t from students. Correctors in his
courses have been taken away,
and five dances have been added
to his chaperonage requirement."
With slushy weather all around
us, we begin to appreciate what lit—
j tie gravel there is sprinkled about
the parking area beside the library.
But we're destitute of parking regu
lations, and that same area strongly
■ resembles a Chinese puzzle of the
! most complicated variety. People
parking their cars at eight are forced
j to leave them till the crowd cfcars
at noon. Stanford students are sup
posedly possessed of orderly minds.
The campus parking places resemble
a kindergarten playroom, after
i hours. Who's big enough to put the
! toys away?
We read in somebody's news
paper that Will Hays lias recent
ly married again. If he had a
son, would it be proper to call
i Hays "Fodder"?
