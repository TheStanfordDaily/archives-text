j That there song hit, "You're Driv
ing Me Crazy," must have been the
1 inspiration for the following juicy
' morsel which popped up in yester
: day's mail:
' Moonlight, gleaming, merciless and |
cold,
; Beating, beating at my window- i
pane;
| Sunlight hatred, bars of beaten ftold,
Prying at my torture-maddened
brain.
Wind that howls a demon's lullaby
Screeching round the corners into
space;
112 Rain, in pellets from a leaden sky,
Striking at. my sorrow's inmost
place.
I Thunder-claps that crush my throb- j
bing skull,
J Mighty sledges of a loveless god;
! Lightning flashes, void of any lull, •
Searing through this unresisting
clod.
I
ii
! Seasons of the moonlight, rain, and 1
mist,
This fool, now discarded, once was
kissed.

Well, now! That ought to hold you j
1 for awhile. Meanwhile, we're off to j
I San Jose, cursing this commuting i
racket with ill-concealed annoyance.
