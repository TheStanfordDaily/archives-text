The editor of the University
of Edinburgh paper feels that
the presence of women at col
lege is a regrettable necessity.
He believes that men have a ten
dency to "play up" to women and
thus degrade their own personalities,
i How true.
Commercialism "stretched its
dirty hand" into the University of
Washington where an arch will be
named for anybody who will pay
the most for the honor.
Who wants to buy "Olenshuggler
Arch"?
A census taken at the University
of McGill reveals that co-eds would
rather have many dates than a few
expensive ones.
That may be true in Canada but
in California women students would
â–  rather have many expensive dates.
But if the stock market keeps
I falling and the unemployed keep
rising, the University of Wis
consin system of dutch dates
will be adopted by college men
everywhere.
Princeton is conducting an in
vestigation to determine wheth
er a too high scholastic standard
is keeping away football ma
terial.
Football has triumphed! We do
not investigate to see if football is
I lowering educational standards.
Princeton's action is comparable

to the v/oman who asked the famous
j architcct to design a house to match
j the "cute" knocker she had picked
; up in Europe.
