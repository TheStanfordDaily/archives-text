### 
j WASHINGTON. Jan. 13. (A'H â€”
j Secretary Wilbur today announced !
i he would withhold judgment of the
' agreement approved by the Kettle-
J man Hills North Dome Association
I for unit operation of the oil field
| until he had been advised of the |
j acreage to be covered.
If the agreement covers the ma- |
jority of the acreage, the Secretary '
| indicatd his approval will be forth- |
j coming promptly.
Standard Oil
He expressed the opinion a sepa- j
! rate agreement would be necessary j
! with the Standard Oil Company of j
1 California, the largest single opera- j
i tor in the field, controlling 11,000 I
! acres. This equals the amount held
j by government lessees, who hold 1
about 40 per cent of the North Dome j
I acreage.
He said the Standard was not in
! eluded in the agreement of the j
; Kettleman Hills North Dome Asso- I
| ciation announced by William Rein
j hardt, chairman.
Federal Supervision
The Standard Company, Secretary
i Wilbur said, has agreed to have 1
their alternate blocks of land placed 1
under a ten-year renewable agrce
! ment which unitizes their acreage
j within the proven area, putting
! operation under government super
i vision to prevent any one company i
j from having control.
"Millions of dollars will be saved j
j for the government under this
j agreement, Secretary Wlibur de
! clared. "A great amount will come
j directly in savings to the industry :
i through prevention of waste, while I
I the balance will be obtained through !
I royalties upon oil that might have
j been wasted, making the field last j
j longer and insuring more as roy- j
alty."
