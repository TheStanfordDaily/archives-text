# SIDELINE LANTS
## HAIL TO THE COACH 
### 
While the echoes of the original
louts acclaiming the appointment
112 "Navy Bill" Ingram to the post
112 football, coach at the University
!' California are dying away, we
jo wish to climb on the band
•agon and offer our hopes that the
ew leader of the Golden Bears will
njoy a successful season—in all
ive the Stanford game.
California will attempt to figlil
fire with fire, evidently, for in
sinning Ingram the Blue and
Gold eleven has obtained a man
who uses the Warner system, or
at least his own version of the
Warner system. Wing backs, re
verses, and all the adjuncts of
(he "Old Fox" will lie seen with
a vengeance at the next Big
Game.
For Ingram's sake, we hope that
i< alumni will be a trifle more pa
ent than they were in the case of
lice. After all, the situation be
eath the tower of the Campanile is
0 festival for the man at the helm
1 the- alleged football machine. Too
i;.ny problems face Ingram without
it' added burden of alumni yowls.
Any team that is called upon
to face Santa Clara, Washington
Stale, Saint Mary's, (he Olym
pic Club, Oregon, and Southern
California within seven weeks'
lime is bound to take a few on
the chin—and (ha( is exactly the
si(ua(ion those boys from Berke
ley will find awaiting them on
September 15.
Added to schedule situations, is
ic perplexity of developing a for
ward wall worthy of the name. With
ed Beckett, Captain Carl Handy,
nd Russ Avery—to mention a few
•all departing, with few scintillating
Lars in prospect, Ingram has a
age-sized problem on his hands.
And that's the insidious (hing
abou( football—given half a
chance, al! of us will gossip
about the season although
it is still many moons off. But
as long as we are started on
gridiron gossip, we find there
are a few yarns overlooked dur
ing the past campaign.
Primarily, there is the story of
Fled" Hand's debut as a guard in
he Olympic Club tilt. With the sea
on barely two weeks old. Hand was
aving his difficulties learning sig
nals. To solve the problem, he
larked a code of signals and plays
n his moleskins before going into
tattle.
Coming out of the huddle for
(lie first few plays. Hand con
sulted his "pocket" edition of
the Warner system. Ever alert,
the opposing guard saw what
Hand was doing—but to his vast
dismay, the signals were up
side-down from his point of
view. And so while Hand re
mained in the game, the Winged
"O" warrior devoted all of his
time to craning his neck in a
vain effort to steal the signals.
Before these "Believe It Or Not"
nrtoons discover it—Herb Fleish
acker boasts of the most perfect
assing record a football player
mid attain. He threw but five
asses in actual competition—four
'ent for touchdowns, and the fifth
•d directly to a score.
Herb passed to a touchdown
against L'.S.C. in 1927, to a score
against Santa Clara in 11)29, to
a touchdown against the Army
in 1929, (o a touchdown against
another team which we cannot
be certain of, and his toss in the
Big (iame of 1929 ultimately re
sulted in a touchdown. Yes. sir—
quite a passer. —L. K., Jr.

Before these "Believe It Or Not"
nrtoons discover it—Herb Fleish

assing record a football player
mid attain. He threw but five
asses in actual competition—four

Herb passed to a touchdown

against Santa Clara in 11)29, to
a touchdown against the Army
in 1929, (o a touchdown against
another team which we cannot

quite a passer. —L. K., Jr.

larked a code of signals and plays

tattle.
Coming out of the huddle for
