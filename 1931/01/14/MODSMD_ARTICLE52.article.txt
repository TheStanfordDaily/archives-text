# Phi Kaps, Dekes Win In Mural Cage Games
## THETA DELTA CHI, D.U. HOOP TEAMS TAKE LOSING END Woodworth And Edmonds Star For Winners In Uphill, 20-15 Win 
### Michael Crofoot 
Off to a slow start which left them
on the short end of an 11-4 score
two minutes before half time, Phi
Kappa Sigma's basketball team
staged an uphill battle to down
Theta Delta Chi, 20-15, last night in
the Encina gymnasium.
Rough and tumble, individual
basketball prevailed during the
Theta Delta ascendancy. Kolliner
and Romig dropped in buckets from
far out and shot a few fouls to work
out their quintet's lead.
Phi Kaps Get Going
Outlucked, outroughed, and out
scored during this period, the Phi
Kaps began to work together just
before the half closed. During the
rest of the game they made 16 points
to their opponents' 4. Warner Ed
monds started things off by drib
bling in for a sucker shot after re
ceiving a long pass from Eddie
Woodworth. Then the latter looped
in a long shot from a difficult angle
just before the half ended.
Three more buckets in the third
quarter, all either the result of
Woodworth's floorwork or his eye,
gave the Phi Kaps the lead. Al
though Romig put the Theta Delts
back in front again with another
bucket from far out, the Phi Kaps
soon regained the upper hand and
kept it.
Dekes Win in Spurt
Delta Kappa Epsilon beat Delta
Upsilon, 17-10, in the other game of
the evening. Seven-seven, at the
half, the score was close till a final
quarter spurt by the Dekes put the
contest on ice. Butts of the Dekes
carried off the individual honors of
the evening by getting three baskets
and five out of eight free throws.
Sequoia I, present favorite for the
championship, swings into action to
night, meeting Encina V in the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock. Other games
scheduled are as follows: Beta Theta
Pi vs. Vagabonds in the Pavilion at
7, Alpha Delta Phi vs. Kappa Alpha
