### Lowell Cox 
Launching a campaign to create
' more interest in polo at Stanford,
' and thus attract experienced players
i who now attend eastern schools,
Captain R. A. Gordan is negotiating
i with the University of Arizona for a
• i scries of games to be played here
* this quarter.
i Definite announcement concerning
' this proposed series is expected to
» be forthcoming in the near future.
Prior to this season only one
> intercollegiate series has been played
I each year, with Oregon State in the
? ; spring quarter, for the coast cham
' i pionship.
Stanford, Oregon, Coast Teams
' j At the present time Stanford and
1 1 Oregon State are the only Pacific
| Coast universities to sponsor this
1 1 thrilling sport. California has been
' offered the use of an Oakland field,
! but has not yet made arrangements
for taking advantage of the offer.
"There is no reason why polo at
i Stanford should not be made a ma-
I : jor sport within a few years," Cap
tain Gordan, coach of the Cardinal
four, said yesterday.
Develop Players Here
"At present we find it necessary
to develop most of our own players
j here at Stanfoixl, the experienced
i riders attending eastern institutions
j where polo is already a major

[ sport."
The coast produces' many fine polo
| players, and it is these that Captain
j Gordan hopes to attract here. One
of the foremost riders in the world
today, Eric Pedley. is a California
; man. He attended Stanford, but be
fore polo was even a minor sport on
: the Farm.
Team Best in History
Stanford now has the finest team
in its history, at least one player
| of which Gordan believes may be
come an international player, Cap
tain Jack McDougall.
"McDougall came to Stanford with
several years' experience already
I behind him," Gordan said, "and has
i improved greatly while here. It is
1 men of his type that we hope to
ibring to Stanford in increasing num
j bers by arranging games such as
| those planned with Arizona."
Arizona Reported Good
Arizona is reported to have an
j excellent team, and a series with
them should be replete with thrills.
Games with bay region and penin
sula teams are also being planned
for Encina field this quarter, much
depending on the weather.
Seven new ponies have been
added to the Stanford string, assur
ing the Indian quartet of being well
• mounted in coming games.

Stanford, Oregon, Coast Teams
' j At the present time Stanford and
1 1 Oregon State are the only Pacific
| Coast universities to sponsor this
1 1 thrilling sport. California has been
' offered the use of an Oakland field,
! but has not yet made arrangements
for taking advantage of the offer.
"There is no reason why polo at
i Stanford should not be made a ma-
I : jor sport within a few years," Cap
tain Gordan, coach of the Cardinal
four, said yesterday.
Develop Players Here
"At present we find it necessary
to develop most of our own players
j here at Stanfoixl, the experienced
i riders attending eastern institutions
j where polo is already a major

[ sport."
The coast produces' many fine polo
| players, and it is these that Captain
j Gordan hopes to attract here. One
of the foremost riders in the world
today, Eric Pedley. is a California
; man. He attended Stanford, but be
fore polo was even a minor sport on
: the Farm.
Team Best in History
Stanford now has the finest team
in its history, at least one player
| of which Gordan believes may be
come an international player, Cap
tain Jack McDougall.
"McDougall came to Stanford with
several years' experience already
I behind him," Gordan said, "and has
i improved greatly while here. It is
1 men of his type that we hope to
ibring to Stanford in increasing num
j bers by arranging games such as
| those planned with Arizona."
