# VARSITY HOOPMEN WORK IN SECRECY FOR TROJAN TILTS
## Bunn Continues To Stress Shooting In Effort To Perfect Offense 
### Stewart Crawford 
What is believed to be an unpre
cedented step in the annals of col
j lege basketball was taken by Coach
John Bunn last night when he
closed the doors of the Pavilion to
the curious, excepting newspaper
men and managers, during the
i week's workout before the U.S.C.
j series Friday and Saturday nights.
Bunn explained that he has es
i tablished secret practice before the
' Trojan argument because he is pre
paring an offense calculated to
break through the special style of
play employed by the invading
Southern five, and does not care to
have his maneuvers scouted.
Short Shots Poor
As he had planned upon the
team's return from the disappointing
invasion of the Bruin's lair last
i week-end, in which the Stanford
quintet showed very little effective
j offense, the Indian coach continued
to stress attacking tactics yesterday.
In all of their contests thus far,
the Cardinal courtmen have de
pended for most of their scores
: upon long shots, with a large ma
jority of the attempts which re
sulted in tallies being tossed from
behind the foul line. The number
jof cripple shots attempted and
missed have been sufficient to win
' almost any ball game.
Lineup Unchanged
To correct faulty set-up shooting,
Bunn devoted a lot of time to
coaching his men on this all-im
portant function, especially the fol
lowing up of long shots and the art
of sinking push-up shots consist
ently.
The first-string lineup remained
j unchanged from Monday's combina
tion, with Phil Moffatt and Tom
Cordry at forwards, Mike Reynolds
at center, and Vance Fawcett and
Rudy Rintala at guards.
Working against a mixed outfit of
"Grays," the team put in an excep
j tionally strenuous afternoon. Its
opposition had evidently been in
structed to some degree in the gen
eral style of play used by the Tro
jans, and the first-stringers found
some difficulty in working through
its defense.
In the half hour before the close
iof practice, a five which is evi
dently Bunn's choice for second best,
| showed well in a scrimmage with a
| third-string quintet. Bud Hawkins
and Don Tyler were in the forward
berths, Bill Doub at center, .and
John Hancock and Phil Baker at
j guard. Baker stood out in this skir
mish, playing a gooel floor game and
sinking a majority of his short shots.
