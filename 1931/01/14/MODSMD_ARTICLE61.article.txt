Chicago virtually is assured a match for the heavyweight cham
pionship between Max Schmeling (right) and W. L. (Young) Stribling
(inset). The bout appears certain following action of the New York
state athletic commission in stripping the title from Schmeling. Max,
however, still is recognized by the National Boxing association.
