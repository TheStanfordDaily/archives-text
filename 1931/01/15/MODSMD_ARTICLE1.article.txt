# STANFORD MAN INVENTS X-RAY SPECTROSCOPE
## Sensitive Device Made By Dr. P.A. Ross To Aid In Mapping Rays RELATED METALS USED 
### 
The invention of an X-ray .spec- '
troscope more than four thousand
times as sensitive as any in vise
which will greatly aid in mapping
the uncharted spots in the field of
faint X-ray radiations, was revealed
yesterday by its inventor, Dr. P. A.
Ross, professor of physics here.
Using films of pairs of metals
closely associated in the atomic scale,
like silver and palladium, Dr. Ross
has isolated particular wave lengths,
enabling the inventor to detect
X-ray radiations very much fainter
than any ever measured before.
Method Successfully Used
Ross expressed the belief that this '
balanced film method could be used
to measure many kinds of X-rays,
including the little known Gamma
rays, declaring that he had himself
been using the films in his study of
the Compton X-ray effect for more |
than two years with splendid re- j
suits.
Last year's Nobel prize winner, the
discoverer of the Compton X-ray
effect, Dr. Arthur H. Compton of the j
University of Chicago, Ross said,
had several scientists in his labora
tory who were using the idea of |
balanced films of metal to further !
X-ray studies.
Research Money Taken
Dr. Ross also revealed the fact
that, in hopes of disclosing the many
potentialities of his invention, part
of the $1,000 special appropriation ;
voted him last autumn by the Na
tional Research Council was being
used to collect many of the rare ,
earths and metals.
