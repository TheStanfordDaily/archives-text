# SEQUOIA TEAM IMPRESSES BY EASY TRIUMPH
## Teamwork Features Play Of All-Star Hall Five In Cage Contest 
### Michael Crofoot 
Sequoia Hall's highly touted bas
ketball team made a very successful
debut into intramural competition
last night in the Pavilion by snow
l ing under Encina V, 35-5.
Aside from the fact that each
member of Sequoia's quintet turned
in fine individual performances, the
team displayed clever and consistent
teamwork, a quality rare in intra
mural games. They possessed the
ability to work the ball in close to
the basket; they never resorted to
hurried hope shots from long range.
Four Rate as Stars
In comparison to the average in
tramural player, four Sequoia men
deserve the title of star. The past
experience and record of these four
shows the reason for this. Getts
played center for Occidental before
taking over this job for Sequoia;
Hunnicut was an all-conference
guard for Whittier; Harrisan was
high scorer for Marysville as a for
ward; Palmberg was perhaps the
outstanding forward in last year's
intramural tournament.
Scoring eight points before En
cina V got any, Sequoia demon
strated its ability at the outset of
the game. Harrisan tossed in all four
buckets and finished the evening as
high-point man with 14. Getts with
10 points and Palmberg with 11 were
close on his heels.
Other Games Played
Beta Theta Pi lost an 8-12 deci
sion to the Vagabonds in an over
i time period; Kappa Alpha beat
Alpha Delta Phi, 22-13, and El
Campo staged a second-half rally
| to trim Kappa Sigma 18-9, in the
other games of the evening. Ernie
Cfiddel of football fame was the bul
wark of the last-named team, but
lacked a supporting cast.
Games scheduled for tonight are
jas follows: Phi Gamma Delta vs.
Theta Chi in the Pavilion at 7
j o'clock; El Toro vs. Los Arcos in
the gym at 7; Phi. Delta Theta vs.
' Phi Kappa Psi in the Pavilion at 8;
