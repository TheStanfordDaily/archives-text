BERKELEY, Jan. 14 (TP)â€”Dr. John
Dewey of Columbia University, to- I
day made a plea for a third national
political party.
Dr. Dewey, noted American philo- j
sopher and chairman of the League 1
for Independent Action, came to
Berkeley to deliver the Ninth An
nual Howison Foundation lecture.
"The Republican and Democratic 1
parties have no principles and are
continually dodging important eco
nomic issues," he said on his arrival
at the University of California.
"The two parties are so much
alike that scarcely one division is 1
discernible between them. .Neither
has a definite goal. Both are living I
from hand to mouth and from day
to day, drawing up platforms to fit .
the political occasion.
"The major political plan of to- j
day is to crystalize the ideas of the
apathetic citizenry into a third
party which will boldly face the I
economic and industrial issues in j
the interests of all the people."
