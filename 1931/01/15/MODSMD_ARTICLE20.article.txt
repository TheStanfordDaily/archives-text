# Women Pacifists Oppose Militarism At Stanford
## 
### 
That the Women's Peace Union is
inalterably opposed to any form of
militarism at Stanford was the state
ment made by Mrs. Alice Park, sec
retary of the Palo Alto branch of
the organization, yesterday.
"Not only are we opposed to mili
tarism at Stanford, but we are like
wise opposed to military training at
other educational institutions. Mem
bers of the Women's Peace Union
are absolutists, and naturally we
cannot concede to military training
in universities under any circum
stances," Mrs. Park said.
Mrs. Park added that she thought
it a pity that Stanford should offer
courses in military training when the
University's first president, Dr.
Jordan, was a great advocate of
peace.
"Most college students don't think
of the serious effects of war," Mrs.
Park'said, "they look at the matter

! in a trifling fashion, believing that
J they will either be killed or come
| back safe and sound. If students
j would only consider the number of
men who come back from the front,
j wrecked both physically and men- |
tally, they would not be so anxious
i to take courses in military tactics."
Mrs. Park also stated that there '
. is considerable hope for a lessening
j of militarism in colleges since a rul
ing passed in .1923 has made military
drill non-compulsory in many states.
That professional militarists and
j manufacturers of war materials were
j responsible for a great deal of the j
j war propaganda now being pub
lished, was one of Mrs. Park's con
tentions.
i It is the hope of the Women's :
Peace Union that a constitutional
amendment will eventually be passed :
forbidding the United States "to de
clare, engage in, or carry on war."
