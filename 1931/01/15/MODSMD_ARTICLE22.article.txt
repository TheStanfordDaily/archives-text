# SENATORS FIGHT HOOVER ATTACK
## Members Seek Recall Of Power Commission 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (/Pi.—
Senate leaders of the movement to
recall the nominations of three mem
bers of the new power commission
began today to fight back at Presi
dent Hoover for his criticism of
them.
Senator Wheeler, Democrat, Mon
tana, replied on the Senate floor to
the President's statement and Sena
tor Walsh, Democrat, Montana, said
he expected to move to send the
nominations back to the interstate
commerce committee for an investi
gation.
Wheeler said he was "amazed" at
the President's refusal to return the
nominations and characterized the
President's explanation of his refusal
as a "strange statement for a presi
dent to issue—impugning the good
intentions of the Senate."
President Hoover, in refusing to
return the nominations, issued a
statement declaring he had no power
to do so and criticized the Senate
for attempting to interfere with
executive powers.
Wheeler said he believed the
President was uninformed of the
facts in the power case and charged
the Chief Executive with "misstate
ments of fact."
Wheeler referred to the President's
criticism of the Senate for taking
time to consider the power nomina
tions when important legislation was
awaiting action and said the legis
late nhad been held up by ad
ministration opposition.
