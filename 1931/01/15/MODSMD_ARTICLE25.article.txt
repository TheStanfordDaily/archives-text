# INDIA FAILS TO SOLVE PROBLEM
## Race And Religion Cause Minority Deadlock 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 14. (A 3 ) â€”By the
narrow margin of one seat in the
Punjab Provincial Legislature the
Indian Round Table Conference to
night failed to solve the Indian
minorities problem, although Hindu
and Moslem reached a pro
visional accord which in itself may
force a full agreement later.
The evening session ended, how
ever, with the conference still dead
locked over deep racial and reli
gious problems as they affect India's
poiitical future under the proposed
federal organization.
The latest setback to conference
hopes was caused by the insistent
demand of the Sikhs for a definite
21 per cent representation in the
Punjab legislature.
Since the Sikhs compose only 11
per cent of the population, neither
the Moslems nor the Hindus would
yield. Despite Premier Mac Donald's
extreme efforts to bring about con
cessions during a four-hour session
no keystone could be found for the
arch of agreement which had been
built.
Mr. Mac Donald's report on the
Minorities' Comittee will be made
tomorrow with his pledge of safe
guards for minorities, but with no
agreement among Ihe rival Indian
delegates as to how they will be
applied.
