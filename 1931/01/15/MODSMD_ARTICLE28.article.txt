# REDSKINS FACE TROJAN FIVE IN PAVILION DEBUT
## Bunn's Men To Make Bow Friday In First Local Conference Tilt OFFENSE SHOWS CLASS 
### Stewart Crawford 
Campus basketball fans will have
the opportunity to witness for the
first time Coach John Bunn's 19.'il
model Cardinal quintet in action
against conference opposition when
! the* Indians meet the Trojans in a
brace of tilts on the Pavilion court
! tomorrow and Saturday nights.
Returning to the Farm after drop
ping two contests to the strong
U.C.L.A. five, Bunn and his squad
have been working strenuously all
week to perfect the offense which
failed to function properly in the
South. Yesterday's practice showed
the results of this labor in the
smooth fioorwork and effective
shooting that the first string five ex
| hibited in a skirmish against an
outfit of "grays."
Attack Looks Effective
Though their opposition had been
instructed in the style of defense
employed by the Trojans, the man
: to-man type, the varsity quintet,
composed of Phil Moffatt and Tom
Cordry at forward, Mike Reynold:;
at center, and Rudy Rintala and
Vance Fawcett at guard displayed
an attack more effective than any
they had shown this season.
The varsity courtmen have dc
t voted little time to defensive work
since the start of Ihe season, and
excepting the first 10 minutes of
each of the Bruin games last week
end, their play has indicated that
before their first game they had
mastered Coach Bunn's nearly air
i tight system of defending his own
I bucket. If the offense functions with
i the regularity that it did in yes
terday's practice, the invaders are
certain to have a very tough ball
game on their hands tomorrow
| night.
Trojans Count on Defense
Unlike the U.C.L.A. and Califor
nia fives, which pay little attention
to defense and depend on outscor
ing their opponents with a fast and
! effective attack, the Trojans count
to a great extent on a puncture
proof man-to-man guarding system
| to win their ball games.
Losing only Captain Lehners from
j the center berth, U.S.C. will present
i a quartet of veteran guards and for
wards, all of them big men, fast
i and aggressive.
Picrce Scoring Threat
Pierce at forward, who was higii
point man in the tilt which the Tro
-1 jans dropped to California by two
points last Saturday evening at
Berkeley, is their main •scoring
threat, while Captain Caldwell at
( guard will probably prove the big
gest obstacle for Bunn's attack to
overcome tomorrow night.
This veteran guard, who is rio
less than six feet four in height,
jumps center for his team, and
should find it comparatively easy
i to take the tip-off away from Cap
tain Mike Reynolds. He drops back
to guard after the jump, and ac
quits himself well in defending the
Cardinal and Gold basket.

composed of Phil Moffatt and Tom
Cordry at forward, Mike Reynold:;
at center, and Rudy Rintala and
Vance Fawcett at guard displayed
an attack more effective than any
they had shown this season.
The varsity courtmen have dc
t voted little time to defensive work
since the start of Ihe season, and
excepting the first 10 minutes of
each of the Bruin games last week
end, their play has indicated that
before their first game they had
mastered Coach Bunn's nearly air
i tight system of defending his own
I bucket. If the offense functions with
i the regularity that it did in yes
terday's practice, the invaders are
certain to have a very tough ball
game on their hands tomorrow
| night.
Trojans Count on Defense
Unlike the U.C.L.A. and Califor
nia fives, which pay little attention
to defense and depend on outscor
ing their opponents with a fast and
! effective attack, the Trojans count
to a great extent on a puncture
proof man-to-man guarding system
| to win their ball games.
Losing only Captain Lehners from
j the center berth, U.S.C. will present
i a quartet of veteran guards and for
wards, all of them big men, fast
i and aggressive.
Picrce Scoring Threat
Pierce at forward, who was higii
point man in the tilt which the Tro
-1 jans dropped to California by two
points last Saturday evening at
Berkeley, is their main •scoring
threat, while Captain Caldwell at
( guard will probably prove the big
gest obstacle for Bunn's attack to
overcome tomorrow night.
This veteran guard, who is rio
less than six feet four in height,
jumps center for his team, and
should find it comparatively easy
i to take the tip-off away from Cap
tain Mike Reynolds. He drops back
to guard after the jump, and ac
quits himself well in defending the
Cardinal and Gold basket.
Campus basketball fans will have
the opportunity to witness for the
first time Coach John Bunn's 19.'il
model Cardinal quintet in action
against conference opposition when
! the* Indians meet the Trojans in a
brace of tilts on the Pavilion court
! tomorrow and Saturday nights.
Returning to the Farm after drop
ping two contests to the strong
U.C.L.A. five, Bunn and his squad
have been working strenuously all
week to perfect the offense which
failed to function properly in the
South. Yesterday's practice showed
the results of this labor in the
smooth fioorwork and effective
shooting that the first string five ex
| hibited in a skirmish against an
outfit of "grays."
Attack Looks Effective
Though their opposition had been
instructed in the style of defense
employed by the Trojans, the man
: to-man type, the varsity quintet,
composed of Phil Moffatt and Tom
Cordry at forward, Mike Reynold:;
