Palo Alto's pacifist. Mrs. Alice Park, secretary of the Palo Alto I
Women's I'eace I'nion. denies emphatically that she directed an'
attack, printed in a San Francisco newspaper, against the Stanford j
military science department deploring the militaristic atmosphere j
on the campus.
15ut just the same she doesn't like that militaristic atmosphere j
at Stanford. "Members ol the Women's I'eace I'nion,' she oh-1
served yesterday, "are absolutists and naturally cannot concede to
military training in universities under any circumstances."
The Daha doesn't particularly like militarism on a university
campus or anywhere else. Hut at present it cannot "view with!
alarm" the militaristic atmosphere pervading the Kami. Xo syl
labus sheets this quarter clamor for preparedness and the militaris
tic attitude. Xo students are compelled to enroll for R.O.T.C. work;
those who desire to sign up for military training have that privi
lege.
( kvasionally one encounters a Stanford R.O.T.C. student garbed
in his army uniform and looking quite inoffensive strolling about
the campus. These "soldiers" never preach for militarism and more
wars: they never sing the praises of the R.0.T.C.; in fact, Stan
ford's army men seem ever to be harmless and pacific.
All students registered in the R.O.T.C. here regard the army
horses as suitable means of equine transportation, and they (the
student officers-to-be) speak highly of the joys of R.O.T.C. target
practice. There's nothing quite like the thrill of firing a cannon
for the first time, they say.
So the. Daily has to confess that it doubts the campus will soon
lie stifled bv that militaristic atmosphere which so bothers .Mrs. Park.
With horses to ride and guns to play with, and no compulsion at
tached, win shouldn't members of the present college generation
join the R.O.T.C. ii thev become soldier-minded."'
