# TAKING HELL OUT OF "HELL WEEK"
## 
### 
Obsolete and ridiculous was the characterization handed ffell
Week at the recent National Interfraternity Conference, according
1<» Richard < irant, Stanford delegate, i fell Week horseplay was once
again a subject of spirited discussion, and this year the practice
was soundly scored by nearly every speaker.
The work of the conference to shelve I lell Week is slowly
spreading. National councils of individual fraternities have legis
lated against pre-initiatory foolishness. College deans and presi
dents have taken up the campaign, and more recently local inter
fraternity councils and fraternity chapters have begun to clean up
their own backyards.
When it is considered that I roll Week was perhaps the most
firmly established fraternity tradition, this progress is remarkable.
\nd now it is not unlikely that Dr. Frederic M. Thrasher, a speaker
at the recent National Inter-fraternity Conference, was correct when
he predicted that in five years, I lell Week will he a thing of the
past.
The seemingly impossible task of finding a suitable substitute
has been the biggest obstacle in the path of abolishing llell Week.
Dr. Thrasher offers a substitute in his "constructive probation";
plan.
"Can we take the hell out of llell Week and leave fun in pro- !
bation," is the challenge as Dr. Thrasher sees it. What he is eager to
see adopted is a pre-initiatory program that will include fun. yet will j
take care of discipline, develop unity, solidarity, and loyalty, test
the stamina, and prepare properly for serious initiation.
Probation, Dr. Thrasher stated, serves a real purpose as pre
paration for fraternity membership. The problem is to make it as
interesting as llell Week without the latter's dangers. Following!
is his program in brief: j
"Cnity. solidarity, loyalty, and discipline should be secured. All
cheap, vulgar practices are to be avoided as they undermine respect.
The best tests of stamina are not those involving physical or mental
torture, but assignments that will test responsibility and initiative.
"Humiliation or indecency is not necessary in order to make j
probation amusing to old members. There are plenty of ingenious i
and entertaining stunts that could l>e devised The immediate
preparations for the formal initiation should be sober and dignified."
To replace I lell Week with constructive probation it is neces
sary to make the undergraduate conscious of the problems and to i
convince him that probation is the correct substitute. The outlaw
ing of llell Week will be done by the undergraduate, not bv out- :
aiders.

"Can we take the hell out of llell Week and leave fun in pro- !
bation," is the challenge as Dr. Thrasher sees it. What he is eager to
see adopted is a pre-initiatory program that will include fun. yet will j
take care of discipline, develop unity, solidarity, and loyalty, test
the stamina, and prepare properly for serious initiation.
Probation, Dr. Thrasher stated, serves a real purpose as pre
paration for fraternity membership. The problem is to make it as
interesting as llell Week without the latter's dangers. Following!
is his program in brief: j
"Cnity. solidarity, loyalty, and discipline should be secured. All
cheap, vulgar practices are to be avoided as they undermine respect.
The best tests of stamina are not those involving physical or mental
torture, but assignments that will test responsibility and initiative.
"Humiliation or indecency is not necessary in order to make j
probation amusing to old members. There are plenty of ingenious i
and entertaining stunts that could l>e devised The immediate
preparations for the formal initiation should be sober and dignified."
To replace I lell Week with constructive probation it is neces
sary to make the undergraduate conscious of the problems and to i
convince him that probation is the correct substitute. The outlaw
ing of llell Week will be done by the undergraduate, not bv out- :
aiders.
Obsolete and ridiculous was the characterization handed ffell
Week at the recent National Interfraternity Conference, according
1<» Richard < irant, Stanford delegate, i fell Week horseplay was once
again a subject of spirited discussion, and this year the practice
was soundly scored by nearly every speaker.
The work of the conference to shelve I lell Week is slowly
spreading. National councils of individual fraternities have legis
lated against pre-initiatory foolishness. College deans and presi
dents have taken up the campaign, and more recently local inter
fraternity councils and fraternity chapters have begun to clean up
their own backyards.
When it is considered that I roll Week was perhaps the most
firmly established fraternity tradition, this progress is remarkable.
\nd now it is not unlikely that Dr. Frederic M. Thrasher, a speaker
at the recent National Inter-fraternity Conference, was correct when
he predicted that in five years, I lell Week will he a thing of the
past.
The seemingly impossible task of finding a suitable substitute
has been the biggest obstacle in the path of abolishing llell Week.
Dr. Thrasher offers a substitute in his "constructive probation";
