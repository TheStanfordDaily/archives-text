# The 						REVIEWER
## PROHIBITION AND PROSPERITY 
### 
—By Samuel Crovvther. The John
Day Company, New York. 19!MJ.
Before ex-presidential-eandidate
A 1 Smith was defeated by Pros
perity, Protestantism, and the
W.C.T.U., ho rightly declared that
there was no essential connection
between the 18th Amendment mid
the material welfare we then en
joyed.
He also advised that as We were
r.ot going to bo prosperous long, we
had better quit talking about being ;
prosperous and get ready for some
thing else.
Meanwhile Mr. Samuel Crowlher
was collecting ill-digested material
for this journalistic atrocity, "Prohi
bition and Prosperity." In his book
he includes the pro-prohibition sen
timents of half a hundred industrial
leaders. , r |
Among them, this: "The trouble .
with Europe today is that it has no
Prohibition. If intoxicating liquors
were prohibited in the principal
European countries, their incentive j
to do great things, their ambition,
would immediately arise . . . ."
Giving prohibition full credit for
American economic welfare, Crow- j
ther dismisses with a mere wave of j

the hand such possibly contributing
factors as the World War, the em
ployment of women and the conse
ouent doubling of many family in
comes, the increased exploitation of
natural resources, and higher wages.

PART TIME WIFE—At the Stanford
Theatre.

This is a picture in which it is
ptoven that a mongrel dog and a
small boy, with an Irish accent, can
carry off all the honors for finished
acting. Little Tommy Milligan and
his "shepherd-newfounder" should
have been starred.
Edmund Lowe and Leila Hyams,
however, work very creditably to
produce an easy, pleasant comcdy.
There is the question of a "golfing
wife" and an irritable husband.
Then the husband takes up golf, is
cured of his temper, and everybody
is happy.
"Part Time Wife" is not a start
ling, mouth-opening picture, and
what's more, it doesn't try to be
one. It is amusing, and has any num
ber of very excellent scenes. Both
Leila and Edmund are very nice to
look upon, but don't forget Tommy
and his almost-pathetic "shepherd
newfounder." —N. J.

PART TIME WIFE—At the Stanford
Theatre.

This is a picture in which it is
ptoven that a mongrel dog and a
small boy, with an Irish accent, can
carry off all the honors for finished
acting. Little Tommy Milligan and
his "shepherd-newfounder" should
have been starred.
Edmund Lowe and Leila Hyams,
however, work very creditably to
produce an easy, pleasant comcdy.
There is the question of a "golfing
wife" and an irritable husband.
Then the husband takes up golf, is
cured of his temper, and everybody
is happy.
"Part Time Wife" is not a start
ling, mouth-opening picture, and
what's more, it doesn't try to be
one. It is amusing, and has any num
ber of very excellent scenes. Both
Leila and Edmund are very nice to
look upon, but don't forget Tommy
and his almost-pathetic "shepherd
newfounder." —N. J.

Before ex-presidential-eandidate
A 1 Smith was defeated by Pros
perity, Protestantism, and the
W.C.T.U., ho rightly declared that
there was no essential connection
between the 18th Amendment mid
the material welfare we then en
joyed.
He also advised that as We were
r.ot going to bo prosperous long, we
had better quit talking about being ;
prosperous and get ready for some
thing else.
Meanwhile Mr. Samuel Crowlher
was collecting ill-digested material
for this journalistic atrocity, "Prohi
bition and Prosperity." In his book
he includes the pro-prohibition sen
timents of half a hundred industrial
leaders. , r |
Among them, this: "The trouble .
with Europe today is that it has no
Prohibition. If intoxicating liquors
were prohibited in the principal
European countries, their incentive j
to do great things, their ambition,
would immediately arise . . . ."
Giving prohibition full credit for
American economic welfare, Crow- j
ther dismisses with a mere wave of j

the hand such possibly contributing
factors as the World War, the em
ployment of women and the conse
ouent doubling of many family in
comes, the increased exploitation of
natural resources, and higher wages.
