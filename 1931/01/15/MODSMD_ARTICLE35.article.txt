The Fijis' publicity agent has [
beaten other fraternities to the j
punch and done it masterfully. News ;
stories of the current trial in which
Clara Bow is mixed up carried re- i
productions of telegrams sent to the
fiery redhead by her many, many
boy friends. One of them read:
"Darling, why don't you write?
Haven't heard from you. Am at Phi
Gam house. Love. (Signed) Earl."
Stanford's first wrestling star
got away to a grand start by
winning his first match last
Tuesday night in San Francisco.
To any roughs contemplating
taking up the game after gradu
ation, we recommend majoring
in Public Speaking. Vocal Ex
pression, and Theater Workshop.
If you've ever seen a wrestling

1
match, you'll know why. If
you've never seen one, you're
lucky.
For those poor unfortunate youths
who vouchsafed greetings on tlie
Quad to members of the 500 yester
day and received in reply either an
inarticulate growl or muttered im
precation, we offer an explanation.
Rushing is an awful strain, really,
and the two-day intermission is a
relief* from being terribly nice.
And all youse guys what got
A's out of citizenship by pipin'
up in class are cordially invited
to take Cit 4, listed in the time
schedule as Econ 1. There isn't
any Eqoh reading room, either.
