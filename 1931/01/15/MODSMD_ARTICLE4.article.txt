MAESTAG, Wales, Jan. 14. (TP)â€”
Nearly 1,000 striking miners carry
ing banners with inflammatory slo
gans last night attempted to march
to Caeru to demand food at the
Bridge End workhouse.
Marching to the light of pit lan
terns they interspersed their songs
with shouts. "If you want bread
join us." The police, who had been
notified of their approach, sent out
an escort and intercepted them at
NantyfTyllon, just outside the town,
and ordered them to disperse.
At one time it looked as if trou
ble might develop but the men
finally went home quietly.
