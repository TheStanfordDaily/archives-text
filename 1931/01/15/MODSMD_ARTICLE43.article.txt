## OUTHERN CALIFORNIA AGAIN 
### 
Although 1 he? sons of Southern
ilifornia have already dropped a
;st two-out-of-three-fall match
ith the University of California
■ugh-and-tumble artists, and Stan
rd, alas, still bears the scars of
e U.C.L.A. clash, tomorrow and
iturday night's encounters will be
>t without merit.
Defending champions in iliis
Coast Conference vatfc competi
tion, Sam Barry's stalwarts are
trouble in large packages for the
Indian warriors. They were also
much opposition to California
last Saturday, losing out by the
margin of one lonesome field
goal.
The Trojans scored in the first
i seconds of play against Califor- !
a, and they are apt to do the same j
ainst Stanford. .With the ' elon
ited Captain Caldwell jumping |
titer, Read of California never saw
tip-off all evening. Since Read is
me six feet, five inches in height, I
»ure out where the local centers 1
ill come in against that boy Cald
ell.
In fact, the Trojans led Cali
fornia through the entire first
half, but tired in the closing
stretch. Price's men, ragged at I
the start of (he encounter, im
proved steadily as the game pro
gressed and were the better
team at the finish, although
Caldwell might have tied the |
tilt up had he sunk one of his
three long shots in the final
seconds.
To the immense satisfaction of j
e crowd, the Southern Califor- j
ans brought a new idea in play
iring the California tilt. A man- j
or took the floor during a time- j
it and industriously swung a ;
wel to cool the fevered brows of !
e Trojans, and the audience kept
no with his swings by clapping
eir hands.
We hope that the Stanford
crowd cm be more gentlemanly
than the crowd at Oakland was
the other evening. Given a free
throw during one of the hectic
moments, a Southern California
player was greeted by a storm
of boos. Three times Ned Kay
was forced to quiet the crowd,
and the man ultimately missed
his shot.
Once upon a time, the Stanford ]
owd could behave in sportsman
;e manner, but of late the charac
r of the audiences has changed.
!1 Hollander may be considered a
ntributing cause, but the fact re
nins that it takes little to provoke
storm of proiest from the gallery.
Rat to resume—Stanford will
have to play the best basketball
of her career to take the Tro
jans into camp. It behooves S.C.
to win both the Indian raids, or
she will be in a bad way as far
as this Conference season is con
cerned. And for the Cardinals
lo lose four straight games will
lie something of a handicap in
the race. 100.
Most encouraging is the fact that |
3 Trojans tired against California, j
the locals can keep up their last- !
If rallies, and not fall too far j
hind in the opening stages of the j
irmish, the double engagement of i
c week-end may not be so bad |
)tn the Cardinal point of view.

Defending champions in iliis
Coast Conference vatfc competi
tion, Sam Barry's stalwarts are
trouble in large packages for the
Indian warriors. They were also
much opposition to California
last Saturday, losing out by the
margin of one lonesome field
goal.
The Trojans scored in the first
i seconds of play against Califor- !
a, and they are apt to do the same j
ainst Stanford. .With the ' elon
ited Captain Caldwell jumping |
titer, Read of California never saw
tip-off all evening. Since Read is
me six feet, five inches in height, I
»ure out where the local centers 1
ill come in against that boy Cald
ell.
In fact, the Trojans led Cali
fornia through the entire first
half, but tired in the closing
stretch. Price's men, ragged at I
the start of (he encounter, im
proved steadily as the game pro
gressed and were the better
team at the finish, although
Caldwell might have tied the |
tilt up had he sunk one of his
three long shots in the final
seconds.
To the immense satisfaction of j
e crowd, the Southern Califor- j
ans brought a new idea in play
iring the California tilt. A man- j
or took the floor during a time- j
it and industriously swung a ;
wel to cool the fevered brows of !
e Trojans, and the audience kept
no with his swings by clapping
eir hands.
We hope that the Stanford
crowd cm be more gentlemanly
than the crowd at Oakland was
the other evening. Given a free
throw during one of the hectic
moments, a Southern California
player was greeted by a storm
of boos. Three times Ned Kay
was forced to quiet the crowd,
and the man ultimately missed
his shot.
Once upon a time, the Stanford ]
owd could behave in sportsman
;e manner, but of late the charac
r of the audiences has changed.
!1 Hollander may be considered a
ntributing cause, but the fact re
nins that it takes little to provoke
storm of proiest from the gallery.
Rat to resume—Stanford will
have to play the best basketball
of her career to take the Tro
jans into camp. It behooves S.C.
to win both the Indian raids, or
she will be in a bad way as far
as this Conference season is con
cerned. And for the Cardinals
lo lose four straight games will
