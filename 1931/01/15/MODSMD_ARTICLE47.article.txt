second half of the Stockton game
Tuesday night, Coach John Bunr

Packard Improves
With the exception of the one
guard post, the yearling combina
tion remained intact in yesterday's
practice, with Massey and Topping
forwards, Packard, center, anc
Smith, guard.
Coach Bunn was particularly
pleased with the surprisingly im
proved form of Packard, frosh cen
ter, in the Stockton fray. Packard
was high-point man for the tilt
with 15 tallies to his credit. Bunn
believes he wil! make excellent
varsity material.
U.C. Has Edge
While the frosh cagers looked
better against Stockton, they musl
f-how further improvement in theii
games with Menlo and Fresno this
week-end to be rated even with the
California babes for next week's
opening game of the annual series
The Bear Cubs trounced the
Stockton five, 40 to 18, last Satur
day. While the Cardinal frosh were
on the long end of a 28 to 19 count
when the first team left the floor in
the middle of the fourth period of
Tuesday night's contest, a balance is
left in favor of the Berkeley team,
if comparative scores mean any
thing.
