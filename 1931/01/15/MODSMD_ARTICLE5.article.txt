# Probation Penalty Imposed On 23 In Honor Code Probe
## Members of Language Class Sentenced, Reprimanded By Councils for Technical Guilt in Cheating Case; Probation To Be Permanent 
### 
ENTY-TIIREE members of a language class were placed on honorary
probation by the Men's and Women's Councils last night after ques
tioning of the class revealed violations of the honor code. The six other
members of the class were dunked in the course and also placed on
probation by the councils last Monday. The probationary period for the
entire group will remain in force during the college career of each
member, the councils ruled. Under the provisions of the probation, the
names of all the students will be sent to the president of the University

and to the respective deans for fu
ture reference, Virgil Dowell, chair
man of Men's Council, declared.
If any student of the class is sus
pected of violating the code in the
future, the proper council will expel
the offender from Stanford, he said.
Each Member at Fault
In imposing sentence the councils
decided /that each member of the
class —regardless of the actual guilt
of the students—was technically at
f?.ult for failing to report the viola
tions. "It is up to the class itself to
report cheating," Dowell said in
reprimanding the assembled stu
dents. "As it stands each student
will be under suspicion in all ex
aminations.
"You did not conduct yourselves
as real Stanford students," the chair
man continued. "And you'should be
doubly ashamed of destroying the
faith of a visiting professor in the
honor code at Stanford.
"It is within the power of every
college man and woman to uphold
the code or allow it to fall and
seriously impair the effectiveness of
a worthwhile student institution,
which has been in effect for years."
The meeting was presided over by
Chairman Dowell, assisted by Betty
Alden, chairman of the Women's
Council.
The Executive Committee and the
two councils arc to meet tonight at
the Executive Mansion with Presi
dent Robert E. Swain to discuss the
honor code. «.
