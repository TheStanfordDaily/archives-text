What would you give to see Notre
Dame play Alabama? I mean the
1930 Notre Dame eleven, as it was
j when it beat Southern California
27 to 0, vs. the Alabama team that
I defeated Washington State 24 to 0
: on New Year's Day. What a battle
: that would be? Rockife vs. Wade,
: Carrideo vs. Cain, Schwartz vs.
I Suther, Sington vs. Metzger! Oh
! baby, lead me to it! It's just too
i bad that such things cannot be.
Although the Erskine Award went
to Notre Dame by an overwhelming
i majority, the balloting for this
mythical National football cham
j pionship was held before the Crim
j son Tide of Alabama showed its

| true strength in the Intersectional
game at Pasadena.
Change of Vote
If the voting had been done after
that Rose Bowl game, I'm sure that
there would have been at least
"twenty-four votes for Alabama,"
: just as there were twenty-four
points for Wade against Washington
State's nothing.
On the basis of their Pacific Coast
' games, Notre Dame is two points
i better than the Southerners, bc
l cause the Tide was only 25 points
better than U.S.C. (Washington
State beat the Trojans by one point
earlier in the year), whereas the
Irish walloped U.S.C. 27 to 0.
However, there seems to be glory

enough to go around. Each team
won ten games, without losing any,
and if that isn't a perfect record,
why my name is Knute Wade, or
Wallace Rockne!
Wrestling Revives
How'd you like to see Jim Londos
wrestle Don George? Londos, con
queror of Shikat, vs. George, con
queror of Sonnenberg! But don't
worry. These two athletes are not
on speaking terms for Londos is
champion in New York and Penn
sylvania, while George is champion
in California.
Wrestling is having a big revival
now, thousands having been turned
away in New York last month at
the big show that Jack Curley put

i cn in the Garden featuring Londos
and Holuban. George, whose real
name is Edward Nye, is a Univer
sity of Michigan boy who, like Son
nenberg of Dartmouth and Detroit
University, and McMillan of Illinois,
mixes gridiron tactics with the sci
ence of "rasslin'."
Cubs Versus Yankees
How'd you like to see the Cubs
meet the Yankees in the next world
series? That would be good stuff,
with the rival Home Run Kings,
; Wilson and Ruth, and Joe McCarthy
managing an American League team,
playing the National League team
he managed last year, for the so
-1 called championship of the world?
That series would also bring into
action such stars as Hornsby,
Grimm, Root, Malone, Gehrig, Laz
i zeri, Pipgras, and Pennock. I can't
wait!
How'd you like to see Bill Tilden
the Twice grow fat and Zbyszko
like, and bust out in some profes
sional match wearing a cauliflower
j ear and playing tennis barefooted
fon a mat against Bull Montana?
i Some tennis racketâ€”eh, kid?
