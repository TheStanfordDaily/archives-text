# MATERIAL NEEDED FOR BOXING SQUAD, MALONEY REPORTS
## 
### 
More material is needed in all
divisions of the varsity boxing
squad, according to Coach Harry
Maloney. "New men will be wel
come, particularly among the light
weights, welters, and heavyweights,"
he slates. "We have a hard season
facing" us, with four bouts on suc
cessive week-ends, and a complete
squad is necessary.
"If there is anyone in the Uni
versity interested in boxing who
has not turned out for the sport, I
would appreciate having him see me
as soon as possible," Maloney an
nounces. At yesterday's squad prac
tice, Fred Johnson, varsity captain,
sparred with Maloney in the ring,
while the remainder of the team
took a regular workout.
