# GOLDEN TAKES GOLF CONTEST BY ONE STROKE
## Caliente Match Sees Dutra And Dudley Tie With Below-Par Score 
### 
AGUA CALIENTE, Mexico, Jan.
14 (/P).—Roly Poly John Golden, pro
fessional at the Wee Burn Club,
Noroton, Conn., came through a
Scotch mist which almost amounted
to a hard rain today, to lead the
field in the $25,000 Agua Calientc
open golf tournament with a first
round score of 70, two strokes under
par.
The stolid Golden, who never
grows excited no matter what the
golf provocation, owed his one stroke
lead to a magnificant brassie shot
at the home hole. Golden, after a
long drive at the 18th, fired his
wood second fully 230 yards, the ball
coming to rest within two feet of
the cup. To hole the little putt was
simple.
Tied for second place were Ed
Dudley, winner of the Los Angeles
open, and Mortie Dutra, Long Beach,
Calif., one of the most deliberate
players in the competition, at 71, each
winning by one stroke in the battle
with par.
Bunched at par 72 stood five star
players, any one good enough to win
the $10,000 first money. Gene Sara
zon, last year's winfier, Mac Donald
Smith* the veteran Scot who is al
ways a threat, Harry Cooper, the
fast striding Chicago pro, Horton
Smith, the young star from Missouri
by way of New York, and Leo
Diegel, the host pro, were in good
position.
