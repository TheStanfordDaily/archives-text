# STUDY OF MEXICAN IMMIGRATION LAW MADE BY REYNOLDS
## Professor Observes Border Conditions Of Illegal Entry To U.S. 
### 
Professor Charles N. Reynolds, of
the Division of Sociology, who at- |
tended conventions in Cleveland |
during the Christmas holidays, !
stopped for a few days along the
border line of Texas and Mexico on
his way East to gather information j
on the illegal entry of Mexicans into
the United States.
"I concluded," said Professor Rey- j
liolds, '"that the question of whether :
or not Mexicans are coming into the j
United States in large numbers by i
evading the immigration law is ab- j
solutely unsolved. There is a popu- I
Jar belief that hundreds of thou- ]
sands are entering this country by |
avoiding the eight dollar head tax, J
but there is plainly no basis for |
statements of this sort.
Come For Work
"We can be reasonably sure that
quite a few of those who come in
illegally go back again. They only I
stay awhile for employment, and it
saves money and bother for them
to evade the law. Nobody knows
how many of them there are.
"Between El Paso and Juarez
there is a bridge, whose main use
now is for Americans to go across
the border to the saloons," Profes
sor Reynolds continued in pointing j
out that Americans also are evading
the law.
Officials Careless
"The immigration officials appear :
to be careless. Maybe it is because j
they know the people. All an Ameri- j
can has to do is to pay the two-cent !
bridge toll and tell the official he ,
bought nothing. Unless he looks j
suspicious he will not be searched.
"112 found that there are not many !
records down there of value for
study. You can get more from Wash- j
ington, D.C."
