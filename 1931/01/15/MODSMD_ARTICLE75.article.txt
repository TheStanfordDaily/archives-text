# UNIVERSITY TELLS PLAN TO MARKET LIGHT DISCOVERIES
## Utilization To Be Made Of Sunbeams Which Add Vitamin D 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 14. (/P)—A plan j
to market commercially the artifi- j
j cial sunbeam discoveries of the Uni
i versity of Cincinnati was announced j
here tonight.
The Cincinnatians have learned j
| how to strip light into thin bundles
| of closely similar rays which have
j certain specific effects on food, in
! eluding making Vitamin D.
Rays in Bundles
For several years the laboratory J
| has been measuring precisely the j
I differing effects of various wave- j
lengths of light.
The rays seem to be done up in
tiny bundles and the size of pack
age, or frequency, is extremely im
portant. The size good for one pur
i pose is useless or harmful for an
; other, and only the exactly right
; size of light energy will do a par
: tieular job effectively.
It is of the greatest importance
that the present discovery has made j
| ii entirely practicable to irradiate '
milk without deleteriously affecting 1
| its taste or smell and thereby to J
' sterilize and at the same time in- j
I crease the vitamin content of the ;
j milk.
Sterilization Use
The discovery can be used to add
Vitamin D in definitely controllable
quantities of many articles of food j
i and pharmaceutical products. It can j
; be used for sterilization in the pre
vention of food spoilage.
j Various germs of fermentation, \
' yeast molds, and similar foes to
preservation of foods are said to
yield to the university's light treat- i
] ment methods. Its discoverers even ■
i see in it potentialities for the de- |
! struction of germs of disease inside !
j the human body without injury to
living tissues.
