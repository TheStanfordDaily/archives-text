# INDIANS BATTLE TROY FIVE FOR CELLAR HONORS
## Tonight's Tussle Will See Both Quintets lighting For First Victory INVADERS EXPERIENCED 
### Jack Jernegan 
Nowhere to go but up, and each
team on its way! That's the situa
tion in tonight's and tomorrow's
basketball battles between the earn
est young men reperesenting Stan
ford and the University of Southern
California, which are scheduled to
occur in the Pavilion at 8 o'clock.
Stanford—won, 0; lost 2; percent
age .000. U.S.C.—won, 0; lost 1; per
centage .000. So reads the confer
ence record. Those aren't very satis
factory figures for a couple of strong,
fast-moving quintets that are to
win ball games this season, and in
consequence both teams are going
to sail in with the fixed idea of sub
stituting more positive numbers in
the "won" column.
Stanford Works Hard
Stanford's stalwafts finished off
their intensive preparation for the
contests in a good workout yester
day afternoon which included some
exercises that, came within a narrow
margin of falling under the head of
scrimmage.
Coach Bunn paid a large amount
of respect to the all-powerful field
goal and free throw by giving his
Indian athletes considerable prac
tice in the art of passing a leather
covered ball of certain dimensions
through a metal hoop of certain
other dimensions. This practice was
not without effect either, for the
Card cagers looked better in their
shooting than at any previous time
this year.

In the matter of a starting lineup
Bunn will stick by the combination
he has been running together all.
week, to-wit: Moffatt and Cordry,
forwards; Reynolds, center; Faw
cett and Rintala, guards. If the tide
of battle demands, he will inject
Bill Doub into the center post and
Phil Baker into one of the guard
positions. Bud Hawkins has a pretty
good chance to see some action at
forward, also.
Word comes from the South to
the effect that the following men
will open the tilt for U.S.C.: Gard
ner and Pierce, forwards; Frank,
center; Caldwell and Capps, guards.
The official roster declares that
these five men average 5 feet IV/z
inches in height as against a Stan
ford average of 5 feet 11.1 inches.
This isn't much of a difference, so
that if the men of the two quintets
could make their individual heights
equal their average heights neither
buncll would have any advantage.
Unfortunately this can't be done, the
result being that the Trojans will
hold a considerable edge by virtue
of Wilbur Caldwell's 6 feet 4 inches
which will be employed in jumping
center against 6 foot 2' inch Mike
Reynolds.
Aside from this edge the horse
men of Troy will hold an advantage
in experience. Caldwell, Capps,
Gardner, and Pierce are all men
from the 1930 U.S.C. varsity squad.
In the Redshirt lineup only Faw
cett and Reynolds played varsity
basketball last year. Cordry was a
.substitute on the freshman squad,
Rintala was on the varsity squad
but saw no action in games, while
Moffatt confined his cage activities
to intramural play.

Nowhere to go but up, and each
team on its way! That's the situa
tion in tonight's and tomorrow's
basketball battles between the earn
est young men reperesenting Stan
ford and the University of Southern
California, which are scheduled to
occur in the Pavilion at 8 o'clock.
Stanford—won, 0; lost 2; percent
age .000. U.S.C.—won, 0; lost 1; per
centage .000. So reads the confer
ence record. Those aren't very satis
factory figures for a couple of strong,
fast-moving quintets that are to
win ball games this season, and in
consequence both teams are going
to sail in with the fixed idea of sub
stituting more positive numbers in
the "won" column.
Stanford Works Hard
Stanford's stalwafts finished off
their intensive preparation for the
contests in a good workout yester
day afternoon which included some
exercises that, came within a narrow
margin of falling under the head of
scrimmage.
Coach Bunn paid a large amount
of respect to the all-powerful field
goal and free throw by giving his
Indian athletes considerable prac
tice in the art of passing a leather
covered ball of certain dimensions
through a metal hoop of certain
other dimensions. This practice was
not without effect either, for the
Card cagers looked better in their
shooting than at any previous time
this year.
Names Starting Five
In the matter of a starting lineup
Bunn will stick by the combination
he has been running together all.
week, to-wit: Moffatt and Cordry,
forwards; Reynolds, center; Faw
cett and Rintala, guards. If the tide
of battle demands, he will inject
Bill Doub into the center post and
Phil Baker into one of the guard
positions. Bud Hawkins has a pretty
good chance to see some action at
forward, also.
Word comes from the South to
the effect that the following men
will open the tilt for U.S.C.: Gard
ner and Pierce, forwards; Frank,
center; Caldwell and Capps, guards.
The official roster declares that
these five men average 5 feet IV/z
inches in height as against a Stan
ford average of 5 feet 11.1 inches.
This isn't much of a difference, so
that if the men of the two quintets
could make their individual heights
equal their average heights neither
buncll would have any advantage.
Unfortunately this can't be done, the
result being that the Trojans will
hold a considerable edge by virtue
of Wilbur Caldwell's 6 feet 4 inches
which will be employed in jumping
center against 6 foot 2' inch Mike
Reynolds.
Aside from this edge the horse
men of Troy will hold an advantage
in experience. Caldwell, Capps,
Gardner, and Pierce are all men
from the 1930 U.S.C. varsity squad.
In the Redshirt lineup only Faw
cett and Reynolds played varsity
basketball last year. Cordry was a
.substitute on the freshman squad,
Rintala was on the varsity squad
but saw no action in games, while
Moffatt confined his cage activities
to intramural play.
