# EL TORO, S.A.E., THETA CHIS IN HOOP VICTORIES!
## Last Half Spurts Account; For Mural Triumphs; Hashers Lose 
### 
\ Second half spurts gave the in- j
tramural basketball teams of Theta I
; Chi, El Toro, and Sigma Alpha Ep- i
i silon decisive victories over Phi i
Gamma Delta, Los Arcos, and the |
Menlo Hashers respectively in open- !
ing games last night.
More than tripling the Phi Delt |
, total, the Phi Psi's won the fourth j
victory of the evening, 18-5.
Zugcr, Howe Star
Although the Theta Chi quintet j
i was held to a 7-5 half-time score, j
they swamped the Fiji's under a bar- '
rage of field goals to win, 23-5. Play- ,
ing stellar roles in this scoring spree ,
were Zuger and Howe, the duo j
which almost won the intramural j
touch football championship for their j
house last fall. Zuger contributed;
seven buckets, Howe, two, both |
showing fine eyes and floor work, j
\ El Toro started shock troops in ;
the Los Arcos game, and when they j
came off the floor in favor of the J
regulars, their team was four points j
ahead. Los Arcos then tied the score, j
! but the regulars carved out a 23-14 ;
; wjn in the second period. Fisher;
and Oppenheim, El Toro forwards, |
stood out.
Buckets in the closing minutes by j
Lee put the Menlo Hashers contest
on ice for the S.A.E.'s, after a see
saw struggle for the lead.
Brilliant floor work by Ralph Gib- t
I erson and A 1 Ray, and accurate
i shooting by the latter, gave the Phi
Psi's the edge over the Phi Delts, i
who lacked teamwork.
Games scheduled for next Monday |
| evening are as follows:
Delta Tau Delta vs. Sequoia 11. in
i the Pavilion at 7 o'clock; Theta XI
1 vs. Alpha Sigma Phi in the gym at
17; Business School vs. the Law
School in the Pavilion at 8; and the j
Southerners vs. Breakers in the gym
at 8.
