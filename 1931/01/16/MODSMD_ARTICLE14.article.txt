### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. (/P) — |
The sixth major supply bill carry
ing $446,024,000 for the War De- j
partment for the next fiscal year j
was passed today by the House j
after a spirited fight over compul- i
sory military training.
The measure includes $60,000,000 |
for rivers and harbors improve
ments and $35,000,000 for Missis
sippi flood control. It now goes to j
the Senate. No annual appropria- j
tion has yet reached the statute |
books from this session.
By 162 to 50 the House rejected
an amendment by Representative j
Laguardia, Republican, New York,
to prohibit the use of army funds
on R.O.T.C. units in colleges and j
universities, not essentially mili- j
tary, which make the training com- i
pulsory.
Laguardia asserted the issue pre- !
sented in his amendment was that
of compulsory military training but j
his successful opponents led by
Representative Barbour, California,
Republican in charge of the bill,
contended it was unwarranted in- j
terference with the right of states
and private institutions to outline j
educational programs.
