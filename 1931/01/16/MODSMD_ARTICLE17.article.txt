### BETTS HAWKINS 
In addition to being the first
American university to produce
"Wings Over Europe" Stanford will,
be the first to act that play with an
entirely amateur cast, Harold Hel
venston, director of dramatics, stated
yesterday.
Interest evidenced in the produc
tion, which is scheduled for January
30, has been shown through con
gratulations extended to Helvenston
by followers of campus dramatics.
"Wings Over Europe" is expected to
follow the high level set in plays
directed by Gordon Davis and more
recently, the same high standard
shown in such plays as "The Ivory
Door," "Pygmalion," "Broadway,"
and "Granite," which have been pro
duced under Helvenston's regime.
Slight changes made in the cast-

I ing have advanced Joel Egerer to
play Lord Cossington, secretary of
| state for the Dominions. Sir Henry
Hand, neurological specialist, is be
ing acted by Ed Clark, and Harri
son Foss is to have the role of At
torney-General St. John Pascoe. Sir
Homily Blount, First Lord of the Ad
miralty will be played by Milton
; Hand."
Robert Littell, speaking in the New
York Post of "Wings Over Europe,"
i the Theatre Guild's third presenta
tion for•the current season, said:
i "One of the most provocative and
j thrilling of recent plays—immensly
i stirring and thought-provoking. It's
! a great event, a play like this, the
i sort of defiant imaginative wrestling
| with tremendous ideas for which the
1 theatre was meant."
