# WILBUR, KELLEY MEET WITH NO WORDS SPOKEN
## Secretary Of Interior And Former Aide Present In Courtroom 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. (A>) —
j Without exchanging words, Secre
-1 tary Wilbur and Ralph S. Kelley,
! who have criticized each other at a
; distance, faced each other today for
the first time.
The Interior Department head and
the former Chief of Field Investi
gations were summoned separately
to advise the House Public Lands
Committee on Legislation on the
subject of their disagreement—oil
shale lands.
Wilbur Testifying
Kelley has charged the depart
ment favored large oil companies in
disposing of suclj land in Colorado.
The Department of Justice exon
| crated the Interior Department and
Kelley was dismissed from the gov
ernment service.
Wilbur was testifying when Kel
ley arrived. The latter sat against
a wall and eyed the Secretary with
an unchanging face. Wilbur gave
him a glance occasionally. Complet
! ing his testimony, the Secretary
withdrew, swiftly striding past his
| critic.
I Secretary Makes Suggestions
Kelley was not called today. He
was on his way to the Senate to
confer with senators when its Lands
! Committee postponed indefinitely
I consideration of a resolution to pro
vide a senatorial inquiry of the
shale lands controversy. Several
members of the committee were
unable to attend.
Wilbur suggested three methods
of dealing with the shale land prob
lem. He said Congress might pro
vide specifically that the United
States waive its claim on leased
lands on which a satisfactory
amount of work has been done, it
might rule the claims of lessees
forfeited when no work has been
done, or it could set a future date at
which the government would aban
don its claims to the leased land.
"All uncertainties in connection
with oil shale lands should be
j cleared up by legislation," Wilbur
urged. "In the absence of legisla
| tion, the department will continue
its present conservation policy."
The policy has brought a dispute
over "valid" and invalid claims un
der the 1920 act, and over what con
j stitutes sufficient work to preserve
I titles.
