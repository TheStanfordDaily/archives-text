## Robinson Notes Form Of Study Elsewhere

Announcement of a now credit !
plan at Johns Hopkins University is i
but one indication of a change |
spreading slowly throughout Ameri- j
can colleges, according to Professor J
Edgar Eugene Robinson of the his- j
tory department, who has observed j
with special interest the new de- I
velopments in universities seen on J
his recent trip.
Stanford's independent study plan, j
says Robinson, though not an exact |
parallel of the Johns Hopkins sys- j
tern, shows the same lessened atten- j
tion to grade points and the tendency j
toward intensive work.
Swarthmore, according to Robin- j
son, has registered half of its stu- ,
dent body under the independent !
study plan. The Universities of Chi- j
cago and Wisconsin are beginning j
elaborate programs for independent i
study.
Whether this growing tendency j
sounds the knell for old Joe College j
has been asked. A-student body de- j
voted to independent study savors j
of concentrated, isolated work, and J
dying collegiatism.
Such is not the case, declares Pro
fessor Robinson. Students capable
of independent study are likely to
be better balanced, more resourceful
than the average collegian, and on
a large scale, might produce a su
perior student body in the univer
sities.
Ten students are enrolled here
this quarter under independent
study; 36 have graduated in the past
several years.
