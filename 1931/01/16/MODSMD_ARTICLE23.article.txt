EVANSTON, 111., Jan. 10. (/P> —
What Professor Arthur J. Todd
thinks about co-eds falling in love
at first sight might be summed up
approximately in one word—bah—
with an exclamation point back of it.
Professor Todd, who is the head
of the sociology department at
Northwestern University, gave co
eds some of his views during a lec
ture on romance and marriage. They
should not marry, he said, until they
have been out of college several
years and then they should march
up to the altar much like the old
fashioned girls of the nineties with
young men who have been courting
them for a long time.
As to "cozy nooks" arranged to
promote romance, he expressed the
opinion that in the eyes of a so
ciologist they aren't much good
anyway. Romance fhat needs en
couragement, he added, hasn't much
of a chance to succeed.
