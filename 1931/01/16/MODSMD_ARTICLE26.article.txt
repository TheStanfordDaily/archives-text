# Student Leaders Favor Retention Of Honor System
## Meeting Discloses Divided Sentiment Among Members Of Councils; Minority Group Suggests That Proctor System Be Given Trial MAJORITY FEEL CODE IS NOT FULLY ENFORCED 
### 
THAT the Honor Code has not been carried out to its full realization was
the unofficial sentiment of student leaders, members of the Executive
Committee, and the Men's and Women's Councils at an informal gathering
at the home of Acting-President and Mrs. Robert E. Swain last night.
Spirited discussion of the situation revealed two groups of opinion; one
favoring the retention of the code and the other seeking its abolition and

substitution of the proctor system.
Code Leaders Named
Leading the discussion for the
code were Virgil Dowell, chairman
ol Men's Council, Betty Alden, presi
dent of the Women's Council, and
Bob Brown, vice-president of the
A.S.S.U.
Those seeking the substitution of
the proctor system for the honor
code were John Lauritzen and Phil
Moffatt, members of the Men's
Council, and John Gantner, chair
man of the Honor Code committee.
For the Administration, Acting-
President Swain, Dean of Women
Mary Yost, and Comptroller Almon
E. Roth expressed the wish that the
Honor Code be retained because it
was a worthwhile institution of
which Stanford should be proud.
Not Found Wanting
The majority of the students pres
ent at the meeting believed the
Honor Code apparently had been
found wanting because it had not
been properly impressed upon the
student body. They favored the pre
sentation of an active educational
program which would tend to de
velop student sentiment which
would ostracize students found vio
lating the Honor Code.
Objections to the proctor system,
developed when it was pointed out.
that its adoption would entail the
formation of elaborate and expens
ive machinery to carry it out be
sides being distasteful to the ideals
of every Stanford student.

E. Roth expressed the wish that the
Honor Code be retained because it
was a worthwhile institution of
which Stanford should be proud.
Not Found Wanting
The majority of the students pres
ent at the meeting believed the
Honor Code apparently had been
found wanting because it had not
been properly impressed upon the
student body. They favored the pre
sentation of an active educational
program which would tend to de
velop student sentiment which
would ostracize students found vio
lating the Honor Code.
Objections to the proctor system,
developed when it was pointed out.
that its adoption would entail the
formation of elaborate and expens
ive machinery to carry it out be
sides being distasteful to the ideals
of every Stanford student.
