						CHANGE FROM WITHIN

### 
Twenty throe members of a language class were placed on l
honorary probation by .Men's and Women's ("onncils. These 23
with () others will spend the rest of their davs at Stanford under
ilit- Hiadow Di suspicion because they wore suspected of cheating'
and because they failed to report violations of the honor code.
h is only by stringent methods that the'present student apathy
towards the honor code will ho discarded. However, because the
honor system has failed to work properly it is no intelligent reason
it should Ik 1 discarded for the I'rootor svstom or anv other form!
of control.
More than likely the present system needs revision. 11* students
believe it needs revision, the change should come from the two stu
dent councils.
