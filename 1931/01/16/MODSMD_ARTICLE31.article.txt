# STANFORD PROUD OF DR. ROSS
## 
### 
Stanford, famous first lor the size of its endowment and then
lor the character ol its faculty and student body, in recent years
has occupied a place in the sun, if newspaper prominence is that,
chiefly because of the prowess of its athletes.
So it was gratifying yesterday to read in the papers of Stanford
achievement in another field, that of scientific research.
The University's scientists and engineers, scholars and educa
tors work quietly year after year, producing studies and inventions
of world importance; but few people outside the respective fields
of the investigators ever learn of their accomplishments.
The heroes of the gridiron and the track oval and the par smash -
ers of the golf course are the ones who generally break into the
headlines, not the talented scholars, who, in the last analysis, are
the i Diversity.
So it was good to read yesterday of the invention by Dr. T\ A.
ko s. professor of physics here, of an X ray spectroscope more than
hour thousand times as sensitive as any previously in use. This
instrument, which, it is said, will be of inestimable worth in the
study of X-ray radiations, is the result of years of research bv Dr.
Ross.
Stanford is proud of Dr. Ross, not only because of the value of
his invention as a contribution to science, but also because of its
significance as a reminder of ihe quality of the I 'niversity's
academic li le.
