Tonight opens "business week" of women's rushing. Claims
were staked out yesterday with the distribution of second period in
\ it.at ions and now begin six days of asiduous panning.
The sorority women will bend with straining eyes over the
I ream of the freshman class, trying to sift the nuggets from the
"ravel. Hut these feminine miners differ from the original forty
niners radically. For them there is none of that ever-hopeful optim
ism that belief in the treasure of the future. To them it is a matter

And likewise the freshman women are religiously doing their
best to put on the old guilded mask, if they think rationally over
their choice, of which pan to land in, they will survive nicely. If
they decide rationally to stay out of a pan, they will also survive
nicely.
Mut iu this unsatisfactory system of mining it is well to realize
that : 1. Not all that glitters is gold: 2. Rough diamonds often have
the semblance of gravel.
