# WELL, WELL, AIN'T WE PROUD?

We road in the press dispatches that the most beautiful and in
telligent college women in the Lnited States, selected recently by
the Stanford campus, is a Stanford woman. Although under the
impression that Stanford women were reputedly intelligent rather
than beautiful, we are indeed gratified to learn that the question
which has so long troubled the male college-going population has at
last been settled.
< )n the face of it, this selection would seem slightly prejudiced,
but by reputation at least the Stanford men are connoisseurs of
maidenly pulchritude, even if it is off campus, so we can well rest
content, that the question has been settled.
Another question which arises is that intelligence and beauty do
not go together, but the Stanford campus is the source of so many
anomalies that there can be none in this case.
Of course women from other campi will feel slighted. This is
natural. I hit since locally, at least, the women prefer Stanford men
for dates they will have to abide by their judgment in this case,
even if it does slightly detract from their dignity.
So at last the great question has been settled and the college
folk can go back to its usual routine for another year, until the par
axon of Stanford, national, and perhaps even world collegiate beauty
has graduated. California Daily Hniiti.
