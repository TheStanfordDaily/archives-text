THE OCTANGLE. By Emanie
Sachs. Cape & Smith, New York,
lit.'ill. (At the Palo Ailo Bookstore.)
Here is another mystery story, yet
let it be added, even though tritely,
it is different. "The Octangle" would
never live up to the qualifications
of a sealed-mystery-novel; before a
half of the book is read, one knows
all about (he murder, the murderer,
and surrounding facts.
The author is simply setting forth
the lives of eight people, their back
ground, their psychoses. The mur
der of one of them is an incidental
event around which to center the
account.
The book is compact, the author
saying what he wants to say without
waste of time or space. It is ex
cellently written and the characters
are very well drawn. As a psycho
logical mystery it is way above the
usual run of murder stories v/ith
their perennial flat-footed detectives
and masses of bewildering clues.

STRICTLY PRIVATE. By There so
Benson. l)odd, Mead Co., New
York. (At the Palo AJto
Bookstore.)
Books of this type are ruining the
average taste for good literature.
Under no possible circumstances
could "Strictly Private" be called
anything but the lightest of books.
It is scarcely well-written, and yet
people will read it to its very end
and enjoy it. True, they will feel
slightly cheated at the finish, but

1 such a feeling will not hinder them
from reading more books of similar
j type.
Of course, "Strictly Private" is a
: mystery story. The mysteiy is not
| laid on as thick as might be ex
! pected, but it is not disclosed until
the last pages in the usual fashion.
The whole mystery is a carrotty
: headed youngster of three years, and
I who she is. Not much of a plot upon
which to hang a whole book, but
sufficient for Miss Benson, which
! undoubtedly explains in a few words
i just what is wrong with her latest
| effort. —N. J.
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA — At the Curran
i Theatre.
Issay Dobrowen opened his por
! tion of the season with the orchestra
l last Friday and Sunday with Tschai
kowsky's Fifth Symphony. This
! same selection was directed by
Basil Cameron earlier in the season,
t which fact makes a comparison be
tween the two leaders possible. If
; any advantage is to be given to
J Dobrowen this will not be so be
; cause of the spirit or impressiveness
| of either production but because of
! the better rhythm and greater ac
j curacy of Dobrowen's work. The
i program was completed v/ith De
j bussy's "Afternoon of a Faun" and
! Richard Strauss's "Don Juan."
Next Sunday's concert will be a
popular program featuring works
!of Liadow, Borodin, Rossini, and
Wagner. —N. B.
