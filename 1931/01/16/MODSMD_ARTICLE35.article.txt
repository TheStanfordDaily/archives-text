Cabbages' Clean Up the Campus
Campaign might be heralded as im
-1 minently successful, if anyone hap
pened to think about it. The ATO's
are staying in out of the rain. The
Phi Dolts have a decidedly blue
! light in their front windows. Even
; that Certain Professor has con
fessed his intention of taking tip
chewing gum as a habit (We'll prob
ably be taking it off, of necessity).
Now if all the cars on the cam-
I pus were parked in orderly array,
some morning; if not a single co-ed
i appeared at Paly theatres without
stockings; if the SAE's would hurry
up and finish with Hell Week so we
wouldn't have to waste time signing
eggs; if the Kappa Sigs would do
something about the broken wicker
chairs on their front lawn; and if
! Mr. University concerned himself
' with wet, muddy, and uneven side
walks on the campus, we'd say this
was a grand place to live in.
And now we have for your
approval an historic jewel of
great price, stolen from the

! blackest spot in all black Asia.
Step right up, ladies and gentle
men, and view this matchless
wonder—the Song of the Chi
nese money-lender: "I've Got a
Yen for You!"
From the looks of things, all Roble
! took advantage of the beauty shop
i in Palo Alto, that advertised a re-
I duced rate on all treatments given
this week to Stanford women.
Sorority rushing evidently puts a
: crimp not only in their style, but
' several in' their hair, as well.
This time next week, though,
it'll all he over with. We're vot
ing a life pension to the chat
terer who sighed, "Yes, God
rested on the Seventh Day—and
while in the throes of a horrible
nightmare conceived a sorority."
So, the five-hundred and the
three-thousand are still about even.
Woman's only a rag, a bone, and a
[ hank of hair. Man's a jag, a drone,
I and a tank of air.
