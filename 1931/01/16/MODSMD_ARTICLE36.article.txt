A DECIDED LET-DOWN j
The Editor, Sir:
Here we have "J. T." in a panning
of the well-known play "Lightnin' ".
Ic is a decided let-down in the gen
eral calibre of the criticism in "The
Reviewer."
Judging from the reaction of the
I audience, in general, the play was
! exceedingly well presented; the re
i cording was excellent; and the pho
tography was well executed, and in
: good keeping with the plot of the
picture. j
We have greatly appreciated ''The j
Reviewer" column in the past, and |
deplore the fact that such petty j
i criticism as this should be given as j
the opinion of an unbiased critic.

MANY THANKS. YOU'RE RIGHT
The Editor, Sir:
As an entering student I have
been an interested reader of the
Stanford Daily. It seems to be that
the layout, selections from pertinent
dispatches, and special features
make it a credit to Stanford.
The point of my letter is this: In
the article in yesterday's daily tell
ing of Professor Blanks' readings
from 'Green Pastures," the word
Negro was not capitalized. The New
York Times (generally conceded, I
believe, to exemplify the best in
American journalism) and other re
putable publications—United States
Daily, Christian Science Monitor,
Time, Harpers, Vanity Fair, Atlan
tic Monthly, capitalize Negro just
as they capitalize Caucasian, Chi
nese, or Indian; simply for the sake
of philological correctness.
Yours truly,
