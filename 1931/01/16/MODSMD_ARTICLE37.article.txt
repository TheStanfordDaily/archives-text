FLAMING MOMENT
The lights were low; in intimate ,
converse,
Our voices pitched to suit ihe
tender mood,
We talked of this and that with ;
tones subdued,
Discovering the Lovers' Universe.
1 I quoted, too, such lovely bits of j
verse
As I could conjure up that were j
imbued
With all my ardor's greatness— j
magnitude
Unheard of, threatening to grow still j

. worse.
Then, when the silence I awaited
came,
My eyes held-hers, and eloquently
spoke
The things I longed to say, yet left
unsaid;
Our lips were close—her cheeks
were all aflame,
Mine flushed, to see the love I
could evoke—
And then (doggone the luck!) she
turned her head!
