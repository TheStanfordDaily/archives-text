1 A survey taken at Occidental Col
lege reveals that six-tenths of one
j per cent of the women favor "home
making" as a post college pursuit or
occuDation.
Why is it so many co-eds mili
tantiy espouse their "careers"
j while at college and then "go
domestic"' almost immediately
after graduation—if not before?
The University of Wisconsin
editor lists U.C. as a college
where "rah-rahisni" does not
exist.
One might feel sure that the edi
tor never heard the Bears give
j "three" for dear old California at a
! Big Game.
i One might be positive xhat Wis-
I consin never heard of feverish
| search parties organized within the
| shadow of the Campanile to find
several pounds of steel on a stick.

Kansas Slate College has in
stalled a "dating bureau" for
students.
Women, filing their names
with the office, to make the
j bureau successful should answer
a questionnaire including the
following points: height?—
weight?— waist?— drink?—
smoke?— neck?— appetite?—

A speaker at the University of
Washington claims that rumor
| changes ginger ale into gin. One
wonders if desperate students at
Washington are filling the campus
with rumors in hope of cutting their
I college expense accounts.
The dean of women at the Uni
versity of Utah feels that college
i men are too busy to be collegiate.
The dean is correct.
The average college man is too
, busy staying in college to learn tap
dancing, harmony, auto decorating,
cord labeling, slicker figuring, or
any other of the so-called collegiate
: arts.
A professor at the University of
Arizona has discovered that cacti
1 will soon be the most useful plant
; in the world. At the present, thread,
i needles, apples, pears, liquor, water,
and pearls are procured from the
' stiff and haughty cactus.
