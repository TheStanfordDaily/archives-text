Once again the Red and Gold of
juthern California is to mix with
e Cardinal of Stanford—once
;ain the athletic teams of the two
stitutions meet, this time upon the
sketball court. And still once again
e Trojan rules a favorite over the
dian, while the sons of the Stan
rd Red hope for an upset.
Playing a defensive rather
than an offensive type of game,
Sam Barry's outfit figures to
keep down the score of the op
position while they are getting
their share of baskets—and in
this they differ from U.C.L.A.
and California, both of whom
set out to outseore the rival five.
Stanford, too, possesses an iron
ad defense, once the ball game is
ell under way. After the first shock
combat had passed, the U.C.L.A.
lense remained in check for the
•mainder of the contests down
»uth. And so this game tonight will
' something of a defensive battle.
With a big advantage in their
favor at the tip-off, the Trojans
are bound to exhibit a rapid
fire pass attack in an effort to
score quickly. Caldwell at cen
ter should control the tip-off
entirely too often, and the men
of Troy will not be slow to take
control of the situation.
Working hard on scoring threats

tite to the Trojans should all go
til. If persistent effort means any
ling Stanford will show the effects
the past four days' drill tonight,
id display a finesse under the
ucket which may outseore the in
iders.
A man-for-man comparison
leaves little to choose from. As
we saw them, the Trojans have
an outstanding man in their
leader Caldwell, another good
guard in Capps, an ordinary
center, a good forward in Pierce,
and a fair forward as running
mate to Pierce in Gardner. Cap
tain Caldwell is far and away
the best guard we have seen to
date.
Stanford, to sum up, has a good
air of guards in Fawcett and Kin- j
da, with a strong reserve strength, j
aptain Mike Reynolds and Bill 1
'oub are hard-working centers, j
•hi la the forwards get along very j
ell considering their comparative j
lortness. It is a good ball club, and j
ne that may look exceptionally j
>od tonight. So we hope.
Having played optimist last
week and predicted that Stan
ford would win one from the
Bruins, we are going to con
tinue along the same line and
predict that the Indians will
trim the Trojans once. too. Pri
vately, we suspect that they
won't—so no matter how the
game comes out, we can say "we
told you so!"
One of these days that 1931 band !
hoop acrobats will work together

leasure and a delight to watch i
lem go. It will probably be just |
ie luck that such an occasion will
