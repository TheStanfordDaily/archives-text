# Menlo, Paly High Oppose Frosh This Weekend
## PAPOOSE QUINTET FAVORED TO DOWN INVADING OUTFITS Fast Basketball Expected In Preliminaries To Trojan Games 
### Lowell Cox 
Appearing in preliminaries to the
two varsity-U.S.C. games, the Stan
; ford freshman cagers will take on
quintets from Menlo Junior College
and Palo Alto High School tonight
j and tomorrow night in the Pavilion.
! Both tilts are slated to start at 6:30
| o'clock.
On a basis of comparative scores,
the constantly improving Stanford
frosh will be slight favorites over
I Menlo. Menlo dropped a close game
to the University of San Francisco
freshmen Wednesday night, a quin
| tet which the Indian yearlings had
downed, 33 to 28, in a ragged strug
| gle last week.
Menlo Shows Class
The junior collegians put up a
strong battle against the bay city
five, however, and are not to be
treated lightly. An extra period was
necessary for S.F.U. to come out
: on the long end of a 29 to 25 count.
In practice this week the frosh
have shown even greater improve
; ment than exhibited in the Stockton
! High School fray Tuesday night.
Coach John Bunn is particularly
pleased with their work on defense,
j "They are just beginning to find
j themselves," he said last night, "and
i are learning what to do when the
| other team has the ball."
'"Chuck" Seaver has earned him-
I self a position in the starting lineup,
I and will be paired at guard with
Smith tonight. The remainder of the
combination will be unaltered, with
Topping and Massey at the forward
j posts, Packard at center, and Smith
| at the other guard position.
Wright May Play
Since classes have kept Smith
j from practice a great deal this
j week, Wright may see service in his
| place for at least part of the game.
Having lost most of their first
string men by graduation, Palo Alto
| High is not up to its usual strength,
| but an interesting contest is ex
! pected on Saturday night. Coach
i Bunn will probably give his second
j team a chance in this tilt after the
first five runs up a lead.
Packard Finds Eye
The reason for the adeptness of
Packard, lanky six-foot-three-inch
center, in sinking follow shots in
spite of the frantically clutching
hands of opposition guards, came to
light in practice yesterday.
On one occasion when he leaped
up in an attempt to steer a long shot
; into the bucket, his entire hand was
above the level of the rim.
! This lad seemed to find himself
in the Stockton game, when he con
i Iributed 15 points, and looms as ex
cellent varsity material.

the constantly improving Stanford
frosh will be slight favorites over
I Menlo. Menlo dropped a close game
to the University of San Francisco
freshmen Wednesday night, a quin
| tet which the Indian yearlings had
downed, 33 to 28, in a ragged strug
| gle last week.
Menlo Shows Class
The junior collegians put up a
strong battle against the bay city
five, however, and are not to be
treated lightly. An extra period was
necessary for S.F.U. to come out
: on the long end of a 29 to 25 count.
In practice this week the frosh
have shown even greater improve
; ment than exhibited in the Stockton
! High School fray Tuesday night.
Coach John Bunn is particularly
pleased with their work on defense,
j "They are just beginning to find
j themselves," he said last night, "and
i are learning what to do when the
| other team has the ball."
'"Chuck" Seaver has earned him-
I self a position in the starting lineup,
I and will be paired at guard with
Smith tonight. The remainder of the
combination will be unaltered, with
Topping and Massey at the forward
j posts, Packard at center, and Smith
| at the other guard position.
Wright May Play
Since classes have kept Smith
j from practice a great deal this
j week, Wright may see service in his
| place for at least part of the game.
Having lost most of their first
string men by graduation, Palo Alto
| High is not up to its usual strength,
| but an interesting contest is ex
! pected on Saturday night. Coach
i Bunn will probably give his second
j team a chance in this tilt after the
first five runs up a lead.
Packard Finds Eye
The reason for the adeptness of
Packard, lanky six-foot-three-inch
center, in sinking follow shots in
spite of the frantically clutching
hands of opposition guards, came to
light in practice yesterday.
On one occasion when he leaped
up in an attempt to steer a long shot
; into the bucket, his entire hand was
above the level of the rim.
! This lad seemed to find himself
in the Stockton game, when he con
i Iributed 15 points, and looms as ex
cellent varsity material.
Appearing in preliminaries to the
two varsity-U.S.C. games, the Stan
; ford freshman cagers will take on
quintets from Menlo Junior College
and Palo Alto High School tonight
j and tomorrow night in the Pavilion.
! Both tilts are slated to start at 6:30
| o'clock.
On a basis of comparative scores,
the constantly improving Stanford
frosh will be slight favorites over
I Menlo. Menlo dropped a close game

| tet which the Indian yearlings had
