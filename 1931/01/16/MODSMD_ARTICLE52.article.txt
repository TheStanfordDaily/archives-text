# VARSITY FOILSMEN SHOW CLASS WITH HEAVIER WEAPONS
## 
### 
Several prospective members of
{ this year's varsity fencing team have
! proved themselves extremely capa
j ble with other weapons than the
; light foils that are used in collegiate
competition.
This fact was brought out in a re-
I cent practice session when some of
j the team proved themselves capable
i of handling sabres and the dueling
| sword.
Leonard Pockman, last year's
! freshman captain, won the Pacific
j Coast Novice dueling sword cham
; pionship in 1927. In 1928 he was a
I member of the Los Angeles Athletic
Club team that won the Pacific
I Coast Open championship in the
1 same event.
James Reed, a last year's varsity
! veteran, lias also placed in Pacific
' Ccast events. Other prospective var-
I sity men who have competed in
, other than foils matches included
John Ferguson and Tom Pockman,
the former in epee and the latter in
! sabre contests.
