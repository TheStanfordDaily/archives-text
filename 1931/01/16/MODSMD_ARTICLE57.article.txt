John Bacon, Floyd Campbell, and
Arthur Hearn are battling for the
first base position.

man out for the catcher's berth and
for the positions of second and third
base and short stop the respective
candidates are A 1 Peache, Joseph
Robinson, and Leffel Holmes. Cam

I elude Calvin Emeis, Newton Gold-
I man, Richard Miles, James Neuman,
i and W. W. Sutrow.
