# UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW SOLVED FOR TRUMPET PLAYERS
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that the entire
United States is suffering from a
wave of unemployment, trumpet j 1
players at Stanford are being paged
and offered a job, according to Mrs. j
Irene Spenner, executive secretary ; ;
in the appointment office. Although ;
numerous calls for musicians in the j i
past few days have been filled easily, \ 1
the trumpet players seem to be a ! 1
little shy about stepping up and of- j :
fering their services, for which there j
are many calls.
Requests for students to work at .
resorts during the summer vacation
are beginning to come into the of
fices of the Appointment Service,
and students interested in this work
are instructed to register for it with
Mrs. Spenner, whose office hours are
now 8:30 to 12 and 1 to 5 daily except
Saturday, when they are 8:30 to 12. â–
