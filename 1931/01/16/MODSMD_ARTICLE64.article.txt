NEW YORK, Jan. 15. (/P) â€” Sir
Herbert Holt, head of the Royal
Bank of Canada, concurs in the be
lief expressed recently by Albert H.
Wiggin, chairman of the Chase Na
tional Bank, that the most import
ant factor in establishing satisfac
tory conditions is a normal flow of j
loans from the United States to for- \
eign countries.
"Otherwise," said Sir Herbert, in
a statement made public through
the New York office of the bank,
"the nations of the world must ad
just their economy to a non-export j
basis."
