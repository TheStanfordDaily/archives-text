# WORK ON NEW MECHANICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY EQUIPMENT IS IN PROGRESS
## 
### 
Plans for remodeling the present
facilities and installing new equip
ment in the mechanical engineering
laboratory which will enable the de
partment to offer greater opportuni
ties in experimental work to both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents have been completed and ac
tual work is now in progress, an
nounces Arthur B. Domonoske, pro
fessor of mechanical engineering.
Many of the experiments con
ducted in the laboratory are con
cerned with the determination of
the efficiency of automobile engines,
transmissions, rear axles, and other
units.
To Cost $5,000
The present 100-horsepower dyna
mometer, a machine which measures
mechanical or electrical power and
which must be used directly in con
nection with the experiment, has
been declared to be inadequate for
the necessary laboratory work, as
it is capable of a maximum speed
of only 2,000 revolutions per minute,
considerably lower than the speeds
of modern engines.
To remedy this deficiency two
new dynamometers whose commer
cial price nears $5,000 have been
ordered from the East. One ma
chine will be capable of producing
a speed of 4,500 revolutions, and the
ether may be used in tests requir
ing speeds as high as 5,400. The lat
ter dynamometer will be able to
absorb a maximum of 435 horse
power at a rate of 3,600 revolutions
per minute.
Old Sets Fixed
In connection with these dynamo
; meter tests several old motor-gener
ator sets are being reconstructed to

fit the requirements of the ordered
machines. For the control of the |
sets and for interconnection between
the test machines a three-panel
switchboard will be installed.
Professor Domonoske does not ex
pcct the installation work to be fin
ished and the laboratory in complete
operation until late in the summer.
Only the regular laboratory techni
cians under the supervision of
Ulysses A. Patchett, instructor in
mechanical engineering, are being
used on the job.
