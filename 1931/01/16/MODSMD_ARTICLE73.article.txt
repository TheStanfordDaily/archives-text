# CANOES ON LAGUNITA Rainfall Fills Reservoirs DROUGHT FEARS GONE
## 
### 
With liberal rainfall during the
past weeks combined with the water
already in the reservoirs and lakes
after a long dry season, the peren
nial fear of a water drought was
allayed yesterday by J. VV. McDon
nell, engineer in charge of the
i Stanford water system.
It was prophesied that Stanford
ites would be taking boat rides on
Lagunita soon, and the canoe haul
ing business would pick up imme
diately. Total rainfall here has been
above normal, with good prospects
for more rain soon.
Recent rainfall added 12 million
gallons to the 35 million already at
Felt lake, one of the two University
reservoirs; 10 million gallons were
added to the 60 million in Searsville
lake, the other reservoir.
