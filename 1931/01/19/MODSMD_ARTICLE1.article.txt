# VARSITY SPLITS GAGE CLASHES WITH TROJANS
## Stanford five Victorious Saturday, Drops Game Friday 27-24 CORDRY STANFORD ACE 
### Len Kullmann 
By virtue of their Saturday night
victory over the Terrible Trojans of
Southern California, the Stanford
basketball team looks forward to the
clash with the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia next Saturday with more than
a modicum of hope. For the first
time in many moons, the Indians
will face the Bears on almost an
even basis.
After dropping a 27-24 battle royal
to the Trojans on Friday night, the
Indians trounced the Southern Cali
fornians on Saturday to the tune of
28-21. Both battles were rough and
hard-fought, with Stanford finally
functioning like a basketball five on
the final evening of the twin-tilt
engagement. Since California was
hard pressed to take a two-point
victory from S.C. a \veek ago, com
parative scores give the locals cause
for hope.
Trojans Take Lead
In the opening encounter, the Tro
jans took an early lead, were in
front at half time by a 14-10 margin,
and were never headed. At one time
in the final period, the Indians drew
up at 16-16, but the ejection of Mof
fatt and Fawcett from the game on
personals paralyzed the Redshirt de
fense and gave the Trojans an op
portunity to regain the lead. The
final score read Southern California
27. Stanford 24.
The second clash found the Red
shirts starting fast for the first time
to date. A field goal by Reynolds,
followed by a free throw by Cordry,
put Bunn's boys out in front early
in the game, and from then on it was
a stern chase for Southern Califor
nia. At half time, Stanford led 15-7.
Free Throws Score
Although held fairly even in the
second half by the invaders, the Car
dinals kept their lead secure
through the entire contest. With but
ten minutes to play, Barry's men
trailed 26-15. At this point the Tro
jans put on a sprint, and a free
throw by Hopkins, field goals by
Frank and Caldwell, and another
free throw by Frank brought the
score to 26-21.
With three minutes to go, Phil
Moffatt caged a convenient bucket
from beyond the foul line, and the
game was on ice. That shot was
closely followed by the referee's gun,
and the scoreboard read Stanford 28,
Southern California 21. Stanford re- ,
mains in the Conference cellar, how
ever, with a record of one win and
three losses.

By virtue of their Saturday night
victory over the Terrible Trojans of
Southern California, the Stanford
basketball team looks forward to the
clash with the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia next Saturday with more than
a modicum of hope. For the first
time in many moons, the Indians
will face the Bears on almost an
even basis.
After dropping a 27-24 battle royal
to the Trojans on Friday night, the
Indians trounced the Southern Cali
fornians on Saturday to the tune of
28-21. Both battles were rough and
hard-fought, with Stanford finally
functioning like a basketball five on
the final evening of the twin-tilt
engagement. Since California was
hard pressed to take a two-point
victory from S.C. a \veek ago, com
parative scores give the locals cause
for hope.
Trojans Take Lead
In the opening encounter, the Tro
jans took an early lead, were in
front at half time by a 14-10 margin,
and were never headed. At one time
in the final period, the Indians drew
up at 16-16, but the ejection of Mof
fatt and Fawcett from the game on
personals paralyzed the Redshirt de
fense and gave the Trojans an op
portunity to regain the lead. The
final score read Southern California
27. Stanford 24.
The second clash found the Red
shirts starting fast for the first time
to date. A field goal by Reynolds,
followed by a free throw by Cordry,
put Bunn's boys out in front early
in the game, and from then on it was
a stern chase for Southern Califor
nia. At half time, Stanford led 15-7.
Free Throws Score
Although held fairly even in the
second half by the invaders, the Car
dinals kept their lead secure
through the entire contest. With but
ten minutes to play, Barry's men
trailed 26-15. At this point the Tro
jans put on a sprint, and a free
throw by Hopkins, field goals by
Frank and Caldwell, and another
free throw by Frank brought the
score to 26-21.
With three minutes to go, Phil
Moffatt caged a convenient bucket
from beyond the foul line, and the
game was on ice. That shot was
closely followed by the referee's gun,
and the scoreboard read Stanford 28,
Southern California 21. Stanford re- ,
mains in the Conference cellar, how
ever, with a record of one win and
three losses.
