Requests Support
Mr. Hoover made no reference to

sponsored by the Democratic lead
ers, but in his request to the citi
zens to serve, he said:
"We arc faced with a national
emergency. The American way of
meeting such a relief problem has
been through voluntary effort. It is
essential that we should maintain
the sound American tradition and
spirit of voluntary aid in such
emergency and should not under
mine that spirit which has made
our Red Cross the outstanding
guardian of our people in time of
disaster."
