# FOSSILS POINT TO INTRA-CONTINENTAL LINK, SAVANT SAYS
## California Redwood Is Found On Siberian Island 
### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 18. (/P>—R. W.
Chancy of the University of Cali
fornia, said today that fossilized
wood, cones, and leaf impressions
of the California redwood tx'ee,
which were found on St. Lawrence
Island in the Bering Sea, was fur
ther evidence that a bridge of land
once connected North America and
Asia.
Chaney, who is the honorary cur
ator of the university's paleo-botani
cal collection, said it was highly
improbable that the redwood or se
quoia could have reached St. Law
rence Island unless this bit of land
in the Far North represented a rem
nant of a former land bridge be
tween ihe continents. Viable sequoia
seeds, he said, will not float nor
will the seed cones before the seeds
have dropped out.
The only other possible explana
tion, he said, would be that an en
tire log, carrying a full seed cone
floated across 45 miles of open water
from Siberia to St. Lawrence Is
land and that after the species had
become established there another log
made a similar journey carrying
seed across 100 miles of open sea to
North America. This coincidence,
he believed, was more improbable
than the theory there was a land
bridge across the straits over which
the trees advanced by slow degrees.
