With the intention of experimenting to determine the true value
of the Independent Study l'lan as it operates at Stanford, the (ien
« ral Kducation Hoard. an educaiional foundation, has granted tlu-|
I Diversity a sum of $100,(KM) to be spent during a period of five I
vears.
'
In announcing the gift, \cting President Robert K. Swain de
clared it had been awarded Stanford because:
1. "It has a highly selective student body.
"It has developed, in C itizenship and other work in the fresh
man year and in tin- Independent Study l'lan for the I'pper Divi
sion, a means by which during the past five years a beginning has
been made in education for the individual students.
3. "And finally, in the state of California, and particularly
at Stanford, there is interest in the development of new meth- j
ods for handling instruction in junior colleges and in setting !
standards for the admission of junior college students into the i
Upper Division."
Xo doubt the first two considerations were taken into account j
when the foundation made its grant. However, because Stanford!
has tended to encourage the matriculation of junior college transfers
at the expense of the Lower Division, there is no reason for infer
ring, as in the third point, that the money was given because of this
policy.
It is a misleading statement and is apparently an effort to justifv
the active furtherance of the Lower Division restrictions when I'reg
ident-on-leave Wilbur returns from Washington. The embargo on
. . I
the first two years is supposed to be inoperative while the present!
secretary of interior is away from hi> presidential post here.
Stanford is indeed fortunate to receive this gift for the study '
of a newly developed educational method. To disguise conditions j
of the grant as justification for the restriction of the Lower Division
is indeed unfortunate.
