# "ROUGH" WELCOMES FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED
## 
### 
The Stanford "rough" is not a thing of the ]>nst! lie is still a
scorner of women and a hater of femininity, especially when it j
appears at an athletic contest.
Witness the I .S.C. Stanford basketball games Friday and Sat
urday nights. Those few intrepid members of the. Five Hundred
who were basketball-minded gained their seats in the wide open !
spaces labeled, "Women Rooters,'" only after braving the storm of
jeers and yells that greeted them when they entered the Pavilion.
Curious spectators sometimes wonder why the women'* rooting
section is never occupied by mrtre than a handful of women. But i
they'never wonder for long. Their puzzlement lasts only until a'
woman makes her appearance in the Pavilion and lieads for the
rooting section. She is always received with a real old-time "rough"
reception that sounds like the lowa hog-callers in convention.
If accorded a little courtesy at basketball games, Stanford
women would undoubtedly be much more frequent and numerous
visitors to the Pavilion.
