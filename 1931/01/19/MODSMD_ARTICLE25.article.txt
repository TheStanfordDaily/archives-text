THE BLUE ANGEL—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
"The Blue Angel" gives us three |
j innovations. First it introduces the j
very acceptable Marlene Dietrich to j
us. Second, we hear Ernil Jannings '
for the first time, and third, it shows |
us what they are going with the |
I sound machines over there in Ger- j
many.
On the whole, the result is intelli
gent and admirable. Von Sternberg's j
direction is evident, and good, cle- .
spite rather long silent stretches, of j
which earlier American talkies were j
guilty. The story is one of degenera- '
tion, not new to Herr Jannings. But (
the German photography, the color- |
l'ul settings, and dramatic moments ;
moke it well worth your while. It j
i.i better than "Lightnin'," I think. ■

TIIE LAST DAYS OF SHYLOCK.
By Ludwig Lewisohn, with 12
drawings by Arthur Szyk. Har
pers, 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book !
Store.)
In this latest novel, the author of j
"The Island Within" and "Mid- ,
Channel" takes up the tragic story
of Shyloek in "The Merchant of
Venice" where Shakespeare had left j
off. Though sentenced to forswear j
his religion, bereft of his beloved j
Jessica and half of his hard-earned i
wealth by the merciless act of ac- j
cursed Christians, Shyloek rises from j
the very depths of despair to an !
! eminence of peace and hope for his j
; persecuted people. 1

Fleeing the Venice of his torments
Shylock takes service with a noble
Spanish Marano (descendant of a
forcefully baptized Jew), Joseph
Nassi, who like thousands of others
had risked wealth, power, and life
itself in the wrath of the Holy In
quisition to set up his home in a
land where he could freely hold to
the religion of his fathers. Under
the patronage of the Sultan at Stam
boul, Nassi and Shylock fail in their
attempt to provide a nation'al home
land. The time was not yet ripe.
Moving in its execution, this rein
carnation of one of the greatest
figures in English literature pictures
Shylock as a symbol of Israel in
exile, telling of a faith that through
the ages rose time and again from
indignity and oppression, in many
lands to honor and affluence in
modern days. —AY. R.
THE SCARLET PAGE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
"The Scarlet Page" is the movie
version of Pauline Frederick's latest
play, "The Crimson Hour."
Modern drama has run the gamut
of sexual abnormalities. The even
tual suggestion of incest is not as
tounding. The way has been pre
pared.
This picture is a combination of
those features which made "Ma
dame X" and its innumerable se
quels historic, and is a half-hearted
climax to the theatre's post war pre
occupation with libidinous subjects.
