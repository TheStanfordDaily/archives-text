I The Editor, Sir:
I am surprised to see that the j
! Men's Council has at last acted as ,
| it' the honor system really means
j something in the University. How j
I nice of them to delay until the op- |
l portunity availed of inflicting pun- {
! ishment on 23 innocent students. It
' ia of course the principle that mat- j
I ters, not the severity of the penalty, j
| which luippened to be light in this j
i
• case.
I would prefer to see the members !
of the Men's Council put on proba
tion than the members of the class j
in which violation of the honor code |
occurred, for it seems to me that j
ihey are more to blame than those j
students. The council has consistent- I
ly inflicted sentences of a few hours' j
I work at the Convalescent Home for (
cheating in an examination.
If the honor system is to be en- .
forced, a student should at least be
suspended if not expelled from the
University. Trivial penalties are'
! worse than none at all. A student
has little fear of cheating when he !
knows that even if caught his name
will never be published because of
I the act, and his penalty will be only j
; slight.
If it were a question of, after
j being caught, expulsion from the j
j school or entire acquittal, he would
think long before taking chances.
1 Yet our sterling Men's Council is I
so far-seeing as to expect a student :
, to report cheating in a class when J
he knows that the cheater will re- j

ceive an insignificant penalty.
When the Men's Council grows
enough backbone to enforce the
honor system as it should be en
forced, then they may expect the
students to co-operate.
