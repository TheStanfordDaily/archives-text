ACQUIESCENCE
To live in idleness and ease,
And always to, or not to, shaveâ€”
To do exactly as I please
Is something I, at least, don't crave.
To spend my life obeying you
Is what I'd really like the best;
There's nothing 1 would rather do,
Sweetheai't, than heed your least
behest.
I'm wholly plastic to your will;
You know you'll always have your
way:
I'd lie or steal, or even kill,
Or almost anything you say.
But no; it is not love for you;
There's nothing worth the fighting
for.
There's nothing I'd not rather do
Than make it cause to go to war.
