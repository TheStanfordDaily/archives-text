# Should Students Receive 24-Hour Health Service?
## Stanford's Medical Service Costs Each Student a Fee Of $5 Per Quarter; He Can Obtain Attention Only in Department Office Hours WHY NOT INSURE TREATMENT AT ALL TIMES? 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article is presented to inform students
of the extent of the University's present health services and pointing out
the major inadequacies in the systems. The University has heretofore
attempted to evade the responsibility of caring for students who become
ill and has sent them to private authorities for medical attention. Within
the past few years the health services have greatly improved, but they are
not all that the University should provide. This article is written to give
a true picture of what has in the past been merely fiction in the minds
of most students.
