The Vassar weekly claims that
some women are not acting like
ladies by dropping their bicycles in j
inconvenient locations.
And at colleges where automobiles j
have supplanted the pedal vehicles, I
co-eds have an annoying tendency j
to place their 135-inch wheel-base ■

cycle, but you have to be a

navigate half a dozen of these 1

That's almost as bad as having Al
Smith write a biography of Herbert

Hoover; or have Senator Couzcns
deliver an oration entitled "Andrew-
Mellon, the Greatest Secretary of
the Treasury since Alexander Ham
ilton."

ance Company claims that col
lege men !i\c longer than the

! girl, the WIDEST corduroys, the
j LOUDEST sweater, the most NON
i CHALANT men —all these may be
I found at high school.
