Little Tommy Cordry, sophomore
forward, was easily the outstanding
man on the Stanford hoop group
over the past week-end. Although
lie failed to gather a single field
goal during both the Trojan en
counters, his defensive work was
rutstanding. Not only did Cordry
completely bottle up the lanky, elon
gated Captain Caldwell, but he
smeared up plenty of the S.C. plays
under the basket.
After a very mediocre show
ing on Friday night. Captain
Mike Reynolds of the Redshirts
turned in his finest game of the
year on Saturday. Besides get
ting five field goals and two
free throws, which gave him
high-point honors, Mike suc
cessfully out-jumped Caldwell
«it center more times than not.
Once again Vance Favvceit proved
that he is in a class by himself in
floor work. While Frank of the Tro
jans spent much time in pursuing
the elusive Vance about, Fawcett
carried the ball through the de
fenses of Troy single-handed. What
a beautiful change of pace that boy
lias!
For the Trojans, Captain Cald
well, Fierce, and Frank stood
out. Pierce was warm on Fri
day, and showed himself to he a
dead eye in shooting. On Satur
day, Frank was the lone spark
plug in the Southern California
offense, scoring 11 of their 21
digits. Not much of a marksman,
Caldwell can play standing
guard with the best of them.
Stanford can well be proud of
John Bunn. Not only has he pro
duced the smoothest team Stanford
has seen in years, but he is also a
gentleman and a sportsman. In di
rect contrast to Sam Barry, who ran
his men from the sidelines, openly
signalled to his team, and protested
numerous decisions of the referee,
Bunn was the same in victory or
in defeat.
Something of a record was es
tablished in the two-game series,
for a total of 63 fouls were
called by the referees. Stanford
had 31 penalties chalked up
against her, while Moffatt and
Fawcett were ejected from Fri
day's game and Captain Mike
Reynolds was forced to leave
Saturday night's brawl.
Southern California merely com
mitted 32 personal fouls, and Pierce
left Friday's game when the fish
horn sounded. Incidentally, the Tro
jans made 1G of their 32 free tosses j
good, while the Indians shot 16 of
their 31 tries—but in Saturday's
rame, the Redshirts shot those free '
throws early in the game to build
up a substantial load.
From the three games we have
seen the Southern Californians
play, they appear to be front
runners. Once the other team
forges into the lead, the Tro
jans, seem lost, and make
frantic but ineffectual efforts to
score. Out in front, Sam Barry's
men can stall, suck the defense
out, and win by a substantial
margin.
Basketball monograms will be few
and far between at S.C. this season. I

two games, making only one sub

To Hopkins, too, goes the
credit for the prettiest shot of
the two tilts. Dribbling down the .
court at full speed, he passed
under the basket before he could

impossible shot, and brought a
big hand from the crowd.

Little Tommy Cordry, sophomore
forward, was easily the outstanding
man on the Stanford hoop group
over the past week-end. Although
lie failed to gather a single field
goal during both the Trojan en
counters, his defensive work was
rutstanding. Not only did Cordry
completely bottle up the lanky, elon
gated Captain Caldwell, but he
smeared up plenty of the S.C. plays
under the basket.

that he is in a class by himself in
floor work. While Frank of the Tro

a beautiful change of pace that boy

For the Trojans, Captain Cald
well, Fierce, and Frank stood
out. Pierce was warm on Fri
day, and showed himself to he a
dead eye in shooting. On Satur
day, Frank was the lone spark

offense, scoring 11 of their 21

Caldwell can play standing

John Bunn. Not only has he pro

has seen in years, but he is also a
gentleman and a sportsman. In di
