# Frosh Cagers Beaten By Menlo And Paly High
## IN-AND-OUT BABES DEFINITELY "OUT" DURING WEEK-END Menlo Defeat Is Caused By Guards' Failure To Check Star 
### Dick Friendlich 
An in-and-out team at best, Stan
ford's freshman basketball aggrega
tion was definitely "out" over the
past week-end, losing a fairly close
contest to Menlo Junior College,
31-28, on Friday night, and then re
turning to take another on the chin
from a diminutive Palo Alto High
School squad on Saturday night,
lti-12.
The Menlo defeat may be laid di
rectly at the door of the yearling
guards, who, after keeping Frenchy
Lacombe, the visitors' star, well
bottled up all through the first half,
were sucked out of position time
and time again in the second half,
| and allowed the Oaks' luminary to
j slip into the hole for cripple shots
that he made good with a vengeance.
Frenchy Scores 21
Twenty-one points the shifty Gaul
| garnered during the course of the
evening, before he went out on four
personal fouls late in the final
period. Incidentally, the contest was
a regular Donnybrook most of the
way, with apparently nothing short
of gouging barred.
For the frosh, Smith and Topping
turned in respectable performances,
the former thrilling the spectators
with two beautiful arch shots from
mid-court, and the latter showing a
smooth floor gafne.
Shooting Terrible
As for the Palo Alto High game,
the least said the better. For poor
shooting and atrocious handling of
the ball, the like of it has rarely
been seen at Stanford outside of a
P.E.I class.
The Indians allowed their smaller
rivals to run up a 7-0 lead at the
start of the game, and were never
able to overtake them because of the
aforementioned inability to grasp the
sphere with any degree of firmness.
Inasmuch as Palo Alto has been tak
ing lickings with alarming regu
larity this season, that 16-12 defeat
is hardly a feather in the freshmen's
cap.
