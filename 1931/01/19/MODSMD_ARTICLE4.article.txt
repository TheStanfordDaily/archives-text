### FRANK WHITELEY Associate Editor, The Stanford Daily 
Stanford maintains-an adequate general hospital service for the
care of its students. In addition, it provides women students with
emergency treatment for any illness or injury and men with a health
service whose functions are statedly "educational and advisory."
Although the men's service is far more extensive than the Infor
mation Bulletin gives it credit for being, it is still far from satis
factory. According to the Bulletin, "the University is able to offer
| only limited medical treatment to its students \ limited office
| service is available for the treatment o/ ambulatory cases, but every
i student is expected to select his own private physician on whom he
should call in case of illness."
EMERGENCY TREATMENT GIVEN
Emergency treatment is often given in the offices of the Men's
Health Service in cases of minor injury and illness when it is
j thought the services of a physician will not be required during the
hours when the medical offices are not open. In other words, Stan
ford men students are provided with office care during the 8 or 10
j hours of the day when the medical offices are open and with none
j during the remainder of the 24 unless they rely on private practi
tioners.
Stanford's health and hospital service costs every registered stu
dent $5 a quarter, or a total of $15 for the average school year of
nine months. The revenue from these fees is divided between the
Students' Hospital bund and the Student Health Service. For the
fiscal year 192*> 30, the hospital fund received approximately $28,-
! 500 and the health service $23,000. In addition, the health service
| received funds from the President's Budget and the Board of
i Athletic Control.
HOSPITAL FEES WELL SPENT
The student fees paid to the hospital fund are well spent. This
| fund provides financial assistance to students needing medical treat
ment at the l'alo Alto Hospital, at the Stanford Hospital in San
Francisco, or at the Isolation Hospital. In addition to paying $4 a
day toward the regular hospital fee for the first seven days and $2
a day after the first seven days for a total of not more than 30
: days, the fund partially pays the cost of physicians' visits to the
hospital and the cost of emergency operations, and meets entirely
the X-ray and laboratory fees and charges for the use of the oper
ating room, anaesthetics, and the application of casts.
Cut the part of the fees that goes to the health service seems to
i benefit the students to a lesser degree, chiefly because il is a part
time service. Students whose injuries or illnesses are such that
there will be little chance of their needing medical attention during
the night time, Saturday afternoons, or on Sundays are cared for.
Those whose injuries or illnesses, though equally slight, may pos
| sibly require such attention must seek the services of outside phy
j sicians, even for the first treatments.
COMBINE SERVICES
Soon to be completed is the new l'alo Alto I lospital, now being
, constructed on the campus near the Highway. Why not combine
the Student I lealth and I lospital services, already functioning under
a single control body? Why not have a student infirmary and a stu
-1 dent dispensary incorporated into the new hospital as I niversity
j operated units? The result would be a 24-hour-a-day medical
' service. Students treated in the dispensary during the daytime would
be assured of medical attention if needed during the hours the dis
pensary was closed.
(iranted, it is no more the duty of the I niversity to provide
, medical care in case of illness than to provide food in case of hunger
where the student contributes nothing for such services. But where
' the student pays for medical service, to the extent of S3 every three
months, he should receive that service.
Receiving as it does such a sizable fee from every student every
quarter, it is the responsibility of the I niversity not only to prevent
illness on the campus, control contagion, teach health, and provide
! hospital treatment, but also to maintain an adequate 24-hour-a-day
l medical service for the immediate care of student ills.

EMERGENCY TREATMENT GIVEN
Emergency treatment is often given in the offices of the Men's
Health Service in cases of minor injury and illness when it is
j thought the services of a physician will not be required during the
hours when the medical offices are not open. In other words, Stan
ford men students are provided with office care during the 8 or 10
j hours of the day when the medical offices are open and with none
j during the remainder of the 24 unless they rely on private practi
tioners.
Stanford's health and hospital service costs every registered stu
dent $5 a quarter, or a total of $15 for the average school year of
nine months. The revenue from these fees is divided between the
Students' Hospital bund and the Student Health Service. For the
fiscal year 192*> 30, the hospital fund received approximately $28,-
! 500 and the health service $23,000. In addition, the health service
| received funds from the President's Budget and the Board of
i Athletic Control.
HOSPITAL FEES WELL SPENT
The student fees paid to the hospital fund are well spent. This
| fund provides financial assistance to students needing medical treat
ment at the l'alo Alto Hospital, at the Stanford Hospital in San
Francisco, or at the Isolation Hospital. In addition to paying $4 a
day toward the regular hospital fee for the first seven days and $2
a day after the first seven days for a total of not more than 30
: days, the fund partially pays the cost of physicians' visits to the
hospital and the cost of emergency operations, and meets entirely
the X-ray and laboratory fees and charges for the use of the oper
ating room, anaesthetics, and the application of casts.
Cut the part of the fees that goes to the health service seems to
i benefit the students to a lesser degree, chiefly because il is a part
time service. Students whose injuries or illnesses are such that
there will be little chance of their needing medical attention during
the night time, Saturday afternoons, or on Sundays are cared for.
Those whose injuries or illnesses, though equally slight, may pos
| sibly require such attention must seek the services of outside phy
j sicians, even for the first treatments.

the Student I lealth and I lospital services, already functioning under
a single control body? Why not have a student infirmary and a stu
-1 dent dispensary incorporated into the new hospital as I niversity
j operated units? The result would be a 24-hour-a-day medical
' service. Students treated in the dispensary during the daytime would
be assured of medical attention if needed during the hours the dis
pensary was closed.
(iranted, it is no more the duty of the I niversity to provide
, medical care in case of illness than to provide food in case of hunger
where the student contributes nothing for such services. But where
' the student pays for medical service, to the extent of S3 every three
months, he should receive that service.
