# MUDDY DIAMONDS HALT BASEBALL WORK; VARSITY MOUND PROSPECTS LOOM BRIGHT
## Good Weather Will Give Sluggers Opportunity to Show Wares; Dozen Veterans Return to Aid Prospects 
### 
With the return of spring-like
weather to Palo Alto and vicinity,
Coach Harry Wolter and his crew
of 40 baseball hopefuls will be able
to continue practice vfhich was so
rudely interrupted after the first
workout more than a week ago.
Hampered by muddy diamonds,
the varsity sluggers have had little
opportunity to show their wares.
Except for pitching candidates, Wol
ter hardly knows what he has in
store for the coming season.
Hurlers Numerous
If quantity of chuckers has any
thing to do with the success or fail
ure of a ball club, the Indian coach
should have little trouble in clean
ing up the collegiate conference
next spring.
Besides Loomis, Caddel, Spencer,

| Plymire, Rhiede, and Millsap, the
j Cardinal ball club this year has the
j valuable addition of Dan Johnson,
; star hurler from last year's fresh
, man nine. A young man by the
| name of Eddie has transferred to the
| farm from Pasadena Junior College
; to make it one more in the already
j large number of candidates for a
steady hurling job.
Veterans Return
With dry diamonds in prospcct,
Wolter will be given a chance to get
a line on prospects for the remain
ing eight positions.
From last year's varsity nine he
has Cook and Mears for first base,
Cutshaw and Phillipi for second
sack, Johnson at third, Hunken in
left field, Rintala in center, and
Campbell in right. Hardy and Oswill
• are the veteran catchers to return.
