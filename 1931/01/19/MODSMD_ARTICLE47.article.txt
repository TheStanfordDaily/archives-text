### Stewart Crawford 
While boxing commissions, fans,
j and sport writers are lamenting the
lethargic slump into which the pro
fessional fistic game has fallen, the |
amateur boxing situation at Stan- '
ford is causing no little concern
among fight enthusiasts in farm
circles.
Head Coach Harry Maloney, in
announcing the season schedule last
night which calls for intercollegiate
bouth beginning with Nevada here
at Stanford.on February 5 and in
cluding a home and home match
with U.C. and a tussle with the
California Aggie fighters on the
three successive week-ends, pre- I
dieted a lean year for the varsity 1
sluggers.
i In the heavy and welterweight
! classes, Maloney has no experienced
material. Excepting the two Indian
battlers in the bantam weight divi
! sion, he has only one experienced
fighter to wear the Cardinal in each
j of the remaining weights.
Maloney pointed out that it is very '
hard on a boxer to fight four bouts
in as many weeks, and that if it
were not for the determined spirit
j shown by his men it would be use
less for Stanford to go through with
the intercollegiate schedule.
"We are not going to back out,"
the coach said. "That is not the way |
things are done at Stanford. One i
of the boys came to me last week |
1 and said he didn't mind going
through four successive bouts.
"A team can't be supported on
spirit alone, however, and unless
some promising material is uncov- ;
ered in the coming all-University
tourney, the future will appear de
' cidedly dark."
