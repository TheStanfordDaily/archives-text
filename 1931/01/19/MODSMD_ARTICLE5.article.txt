# WORLD SLOWING UP, EINSTEIN TO LEARN FOR WEEK'S LESSON
## 
### 
PASADENA, Jan. 18. (£>)— Albert 1
Einstein's lessons in astro-physics :
this week deal with the extension of
thermodynamics to general relativ
ity. His instructor on that subject ;
will be Richard Chase Tolman, 1
physicist of California Institute of !
Technology, who figures that the i
world is running down.
Before the lecture, in the latter !
part of the week, the German pro- j
fessor will again visit the Mount
Wilson laboratory and hear some- j
thing about how the heat of stars \
is measured. Small as it is, the heat j
from a star can easily be measured. ;
