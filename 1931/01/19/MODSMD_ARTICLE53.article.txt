# FEDERAL REPORTS DENOUNCE COLLEGE SOCIAL CONDITIONS
## Claim Unlimited Expense, Lack of Chaperonage At Campus Affairs 
### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 18. (P.1.P.)
Tlie red flag of co-educational an- I
tagonism was waved before 69 land- i
giant universities today in a federal J
inquiry into campus social regula
tion.
Chief objection centered on lack j
of chaperonage at fraternity parties, |
and the unlimited expense of social |
affairs given by fraternities and !
sororities.
Fraternity affairs which woman I
students are allowed to attend un- j
chaperoned are characterized as a j
"serious problem" in the federal re- i
port.
Fraternity Rules
Eleven of the 69 universities un- !
dor survey admitted the lack of
chaperonage, though five of these i
had specific rules to the contrary.
Thirty colleges reported that wo- j
men were not permitted to go to
men's fraternity houses, except for
social events, but here again two
say that the rule is frequently ,
broken.
Of the six universities who give
woman students everyday entrance
to the fraternities, four require no
official head at the house.
Social Restrictions
The report goes on to say that
none of the land-grant institutions
make any attempt to regulate the j
total expense, and the number of j
affairs to take place in each semes
ter.
University heads are urged against j
student self-regulation with sube- j
quent official punishment.
"The answer is probably not j
stricter regulation, but closer co- !
operation, more real interest, in j
planning constructive programs,"
according to the report.
