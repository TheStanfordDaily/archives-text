From Acting-President Robert E.
Swain, comes: "The hosts of Stan
ford men and women, far and near,
are thinking today of Dr. Jordan in
terms of the deepest gratitude and
affection as he reaches his eightieth
birthday. No one can look back over
the 40 years since the University
opened its doors in the autumn of
'91 without having his attention
fixed on this great leader, truly
great in mind, heart, and soul, who
became its first President.
"A young man then, he gathered
about him a notable group of young
scholars who had vision and with it
the courage and the wisdom to make
their dreams come true. And
through the ripening years which
followed, his interests and influence
widened until he took rank among
the leaders of his time.
Few men touched with such
scholarly pei'eeption and zeal so
many fields of human thought and
action. One need only look over the
varied and extensive list of his
publications, some of which are
classics in their field, to be im
pressed by this fact. But back of all
that he put in written form, or
spoke from the public platform,
there stands the great figure of the
man himself. One cannot measure
the influence which he exerted on
the lives of the men and women of
Stanford and of the wider circle of
youth of the nation. We all owe him
much, and wish that he might en
joy this day in full measure, the
rewards of a life so richly endowed
and so unselfishly spent in service."
From Judge John T. Nourse,
Stanford alumnus, comes this re
membrance of earlier campus days:
"1 like to recall the picture of Dr.
Jordan playing first base on the
faculty baseball teams. That was in
the old days when the faculty looked
upon the students as friends and
associates in the struggle for edu
cational development rather than as
mere subjects for educational ex
periments.
"The faculty-senior baseball game
was a feature of the annual com
mencement week exercises. It al
ways drew a large crowd and I be
lieve Dr. Jordan was the main at
traction. He played a nice game at
first and had to cover a lot of ter
ritory as some of his associates
were pretty wild in throwing the
ball around. I remember particu
larly one member of the law fac
ulty whom I thought was just about
as accurate in tossing to first as he
was in ,marking my final in 'Torts.'
"But when he took his turn at
the plate Dr. Jordan had the crowd
with him. We all wanted to see him
hit safely because we enjoyed
watching him run. As the years
passed the Doctor's hitting seemed
to improve; he no doubt had rea
soned that the harder he hit the
ball, the easier it would be to run
the bases.
"In the last few years of these
contests Dr. Jordan selected a jun
ior to run for him and there were
many who strove for this honor.
Generally it was an easy roll to fill
as the Doctor either hit hard and
far, or struck out in the attempt.
There was no 'half-way' with him
in anything."

affection as he reaches his eightieth
birthday. No one can look back over
the 40 years since the University
opened its doors in the autumn of
'91 without having his attention
fixed on this great leader, truly
great in mind, heart, and soul, who
became its first President.
"A young man then, he gathered
about him a notable group of young
scholars who had vision and with it
the courage and the wisdom to make
their dreams come true. And
through the ripening years which
followed, his interests and influence
widened until he took rank among
the leaders of his time.
Few men touched with such
scholarly pei'eeption and zeal so
many fields of human thought and
action. One need only look over the
varied and extensive list of his
publications, some of which are
classics in their field, to be im
pressed by this fact. But back of all
that he put in written form, or
spoke from the public platform,
there stands the great figure of the
man himself. One cannot measure
the influence which he exerted on
the lives of the men and women of
Stanford and of the wider circle of
youth of the nation. We all owe him
much, and wish that he might en
joy this day in full measure, the
rewards of a life so richly endowed
and so unselfishly spent in service."
From Judge John T. Nourse,
Stanford alumnus, comes this re
membrance of earlier campus days:
"1 like to recall the picture of Dr.
Jordan playing first base on the
faculty baseball teams. That was in
the old days when the faculty looked
upon the students as friends and
associates in the struggle for edu
cational development rather than as
mere subjects for educational ex
periments.
"The faculty-senior baseball game
was a feature of the annual com
mencement week exercises. It al
ways drew a large crowd and I be
lieve Dr. Jordan was the main at
traction. He played a nice game at
first and had to cover a lot of ter
ritory as some of his associates
were pretty wild in throwing the
ball around. I remember particu
larly one member of the law fac
ulty whom I thought was just about
as accurate in tossing to first as he
was in ,marking my final in 'Torts.'
"But when he took his turn at
the plate Dr. Jordan had the crowd
with him. We all wanted to see him
hit safely because we enjoyed
watching him run. As the years
passed the Doctor's hitting seemed
to improve; he no doubt had rea
soned that the harder he hit the
ball, the easier it would be to run
the bases.
"In the last few years of these
contests Dr. Jordan selected a jun
ior to run for him and there were
many who strove for this honor.
Generally it was an easy roll to fill
as the Doctor either hit hard and
far, or struck out in the attempt.
There was no 'half-way' with him
in anything."
