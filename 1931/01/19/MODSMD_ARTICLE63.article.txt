# CHAPPIE TO OFFER MEANS OF TESTING ROUGHS TOMORROW
## 
### 
How much of a rough are you?
The Stanford student will have a
real chance to measure his stand
ing tomorrow, when the "Rough's
Issue" of the Chaparral makes its
appearance on the campus. The
famed Zilcher test, a deep study into
what makes up a rough, is pre
sented for the first time, and scores
everyone according to the answers
to such questions as "Have you
ever been in the Cit reading room?"
"Do you admire Rudy Vallee?" and
"Have you ever queened at a bas
ketball game?"
The worse loafer you are, the
higher your score, it is said by the
Chappie staff. Students will have a
dandy time comparing scores, they
add. and everyone should get his
copy early, says the business man
ager.
Other local material goes to make
up the issue, the fourth magazine
published under the editorship of
Burnell Gould.
