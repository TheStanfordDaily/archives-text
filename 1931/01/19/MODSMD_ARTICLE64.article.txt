WASHINGTON, Jan. 18. I/P) â€”
Two separate committees that came
out of the independent oil pro
ducers conference were laying plans
today for taking their campaign for
relief to the White House and to
Congress.
An executive committee is having
put into legislative form its pro
posals for a tariff on oil imports, a
partial embargo on crude oil, and a
ban upon refined products.
Another group will take the ap
peal of the producers to the White
House in a conference with the
President. The time for its visit has
not yet been fixed.
Meanwhile, bills already have
been introduced by Representatives
Garber of Oklahoma and Hoch of
Kansas.
