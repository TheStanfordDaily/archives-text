# VIOLET RAY LAMP TO AID POLICE IN CRIME DETECTION
## New Device Uses Invisible Light Rays To Reveal "Raised" Checks 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 18 (A I ).â€”Thieves j
and embezzlers now can be traced
with a new kind of "dark lantern"
which sends out "black" light rays
that actually give no light.
Things that ordinary light does not
reveal can be seen with the aid of j
these invisible rays.
They reveal invisible ink mark
ings on money, erasures on "raised" |
checks, differences between genuine j
and synthetic products that by all j
other tests seem exactly the same.
New "Dark Lantern"
The new style "dark lantern" i-eal- ;
ly is an ultra-violet ray lamp, ex- I
plains Dr. Herman Goodman, who i
demonstrated the apparatus. It gives j
out both visible and invisible light, j
The old-fashioned dark lantern !
had a shutter that could shut off all i
the light at will. In the new "dark j
lantern" a glass filter replaces the |
shutter, and it cuts off only the rays ]
that give light, allowing invisible 1
rays or "black light" to pass through, i
Light Reflected
"Black light" actually is ultra-vio- |
let light. The visible light from the j
same source has been removed by j
the filter. The black light causes |
certain substances to shine in the j
dark.
An object is seen because it re- |
fleets light. Substances sensitive to i
the black light shine in the dark |
because they transform the black '
light waves into waves of visible [
light.
When ordinary light is present
with black light it "drowns out" the
black light's reflection.
