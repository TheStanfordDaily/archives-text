# A.W.S. LEADER SEES NEED OF CODE CHANGES
## Alden Discusses Methods; Favors Honor System Over Proctors 
### 
Believing that present basis of the !
honor system is one of the reasons j
for its ill success, Betty Alden, pres- j
ident of Associated Women Students, !
yesterday outlined the two examina- i
tion methods, proctor and honor, and
gave the suggestions made by those j
believing in the honor code.
"The end of the two systems, hon- I
or and proctor, is the same, that is, |
no cheating in the class room; but j
the means to that end are totally I
different.
"The former involves complete |
freedom in the class room, the latter, j
the complete loss of that freedom. In ;
theory we believe the honor system j
to be the better of the two; in prac- !
lice we differ.
Rebuilding Attempts Failed
"Those who advocate the replace- 1
ment of the honor code by the proc- I
tor system do so because they are ;
discouraged. Year after year they !
have seen attempts made to rebuild ,
and to revitalize the code. They j
have seen these attempts fail. They j
are justified in believing that an- i
other attempt, through a period of j
months, would fail likewise.
"Those of us who advocate the |
retention of the honor code, after j
having learned of the plans suggest- j
ed in the revival meetings of the j
past few years, know they were not j
carried on in a manner which we!
believe possible. The functioning of j
the honor code in the past has relied j
on the reporting of one individual }
by another. An act such as this is j
regarded by most of us as contrary j
to our codes of ethics, as an act un- j
worthy of a gentleman, for we have !
hjid instilled into us the fact that it j
is unworthy 'to tell on' someone. I
Urges Code Amendment
"Since this is true, we should
throw aside this premise as neces- j
sary to the functioning of the code
and substitute something of which ,
the majority approves. One sugges- |
tion that might prove feasible is j
this: Instead of reporting the indi
vidual to the professor, the report- '
ing of cheating, without mention of !
names, could be done. The profes
sor would then come into the room |
and act as proctor, at the request of i
the student councils. This would en
able htose classes worthy of the '
honor code to function under it, '
while it would take care of the j
classes which were incapable of [
honorable work.
"It may take time, and it certainly j
will take consistent effort to find I
the necessary basis on which to
make the honor code workable, but.
I believe the retention of that code j
worth striving for."
