# MANY FRIENDS SEND FLOWERS TO DR. JORDAN
## A.S.S.U. Gift Delights Aged Chancellor; Hoovers Send Telegram BIRTHDAY CAKE SENT 
### 
Eighty cardinal candles flickered
on a large white birthday cake for
David Starr Jordan, who celebrated
the anniversary in quiet fashion at
his home on the campus yesterday.
Flowers and telegrams poured in
all morning from friends of the
world-renowned educator and scien
tist. At noon, the cake, a gift of
the Stanford Faculty Women's Club,
v/as brought glowing into the living
room, where Dr. Jordan sat for an
hour or so, enjoying the company
of a few close friends—faculty mem
bers, neighbors, and scientific col
leagues—before retiring to the sick
bed which has claimed him inter
mittently during the past year and
a half.
"Room" Major Gift
The major birthday gift was "The
Jordan Room," given by Stanford
as evidence of an appreciation of
his years of labor and accomplish
ment for the University.
Dr. Jordan was particularly de
lighted by the azalea tree and box
of spring flowers sent him by the
Associated Students.
Messages included that of Mrs.
Herbert Hoover, who, like her hus
band, was a pupil of the chancellor
emeritus during his active presi
dency and teaching days at Stan
ford.
Many Greetings Sent
Others who sent greetings include
Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur;
Robert G. Sproul, president of the
University of California, who char
acterized Dr. Jordan as "great scien
tist, great humanist, great educator";
Dr. R. B. von KleinSmid, president
of the University of Southern Cali
fornia: Dr. Earnest C. Moore, di
rector of the University of California
at Los Angeles.
Although the celebration here was
quiet, Stanford people the country
over w<;re gathering yesterday in
commemoration of the birthday.
Chicago alumni held a Jordan ban
quet last night. In Danville, at the
foot of Mount Diablo, a valley oak
was planted in honor of the noted
educator, at the intersection of two
paved highways in the proposed
Diablo Park.
