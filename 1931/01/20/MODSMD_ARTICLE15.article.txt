Extra Period Needed
In last night's games the Delta
Tau Delta-Sequoia affair was easily ,
the most interesting for the spec- !
lators. Tight-fought all the way
through, one minute to play found j
the score tied at 12 all. Jensen sunk :
a sucker shot for the hall men to
put them in the lead 14-12, but the !
D.T.'s groans had barely echoed !
when Twelvetrees unleashed a long !
shot to knot the score at 14 apiece, \
as the game ended.
In the extra five minute period,
Jones tallied for the Delts to put
the game on ice. Sequoia threatened
always but was only able to garner
one free throw.
Breakers Win Easily
The Breakers aggregation was
able to coast the major part of the
game. Close guarding by Dietrich
and Bogue formed impregnable op
position to the Southerners. Break
ers offered a workmanlike attack
and wasted no time in building up
a commanding lead, after which they
sent in a parade of fresh substitutes. ;
Theta Xi and Alpha Sigma Phi
were neck and neck all the way. j
The Theta's held a 10-9 lead at half
time, and ran their string out to \
cinch a win, 20 to 17.
The Law School team failed to '
show up for their scheduled tangle j
with the Business School.
