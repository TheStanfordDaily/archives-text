LANSING, Mich., Jan. 19. (ZD-
Fire swept through the basement
floor of Michigan's historic state
house early today, causing damage
estimated at $10,000.
The fire broke out shortly after 1
o'clock in a news stand, and swept
up the elevator shaft and around
the rotunda to cause heavy damage
to the walls, ceilings, and the war
museum. For a time the flames
threatened the tax division of the
auditor general's department.
