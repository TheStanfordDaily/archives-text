# "500" Reveal How Rough May Reach First Base
## 
### 
What is your batting average with
the 500?
Are you notoriously weak in the
pinches, or can you step up and
crack big league pitching for a home
run? How are you on fast balls
across the inside cornet 1 ?
Middies Rate 'Em
At Annapolis the midshipmen rate
their dates on a numerical basis, a
"4.0" girl being the last word in
looks, personality, dancing and so
forth. A "2.5" girl is just passing,
and anything above a "3.5" is con
sidered very fine, indeed.
The Stanford girls, the Daily's
keyhole correspondent discovered
yesterday, also have a system for
classifying dates, but the classifica
tion rests for the most part on the
type of entertainment the aforesaid
date provides, and takes little con
sideration of his personal attributes,
if any.
Light Hitters
Any man who takes her to a show
in Palo Alto is ranked by the Stan
ford co-ed as a .200 hitter, and is
given credit for a one-base hit, no
more. Such a man is kept in the

i lineup, so to speak, more for dc
; pendability than anything else, but
1 his chances of getting past first base
J are extremely remote.
The boy who thinks that a show
j in San Jose is the last word in en
tertainment is ranked- as a .250 hit-
I ter, and usually draws fifth or sixth
i place in the batting order, which is
! equivalent to an 11:30 leave.
The Clean-up Men
The heavy hitters, thinks the Stan
ford girl, are the youths who take
; them to San Francisco. A show or
a dance in the city is an automatic
I three-bagger, and the lucky man
gets a nice fat .300 average in the
! yearly batting lists. He is very like
! ly to be moved up to Friday night,
, or third place in the batting order.
I The cream of the campus, socially
speaking, however, are the sluggers
J â€”the .400 hitters. These are the boys
who crash through with a theater
[date in San Francisco, and then cap
j the evening by taking the girl hotel
dancing. That constitutes a home
| run, and the batsman is almost sure
1 to score.
Choc shakes at the Cellar are
counted as sacrifice flies.
