## New Government to Remove Religious Transactions on Suffrage; Britain to Handle Negotiations Abroad; India to Have Domestic Control 
### 
I ONDON, Jan. 19. (/P) â€”Partnership of India as a dominion with re
sponsible self-government in the British commonwealth of nations
was pledged today by Ramsay Mac Donald as the Great Britain round
table conference in Old St. James' Palace came to a close.
"You have opened a new chapter in the history of India," was King
George's message to the Iftft or more delegates. The Prime Minister, in a
long and earnest speech outlining British policy in India, extended the
hand of dominion fellowship to the great Asian sub-continent where a

fifth of the world's population
dwells.
The policy he enunciated prom
ised these innovations:
(1; Amnesty for India's 50,000
political prisoners if "civil order" is
restored in India.
(2) An invitation to the Indian
extremists to participate in the ne
gotiations still to come before the
new Indian government is estab
lished.
(3) Establishment of full respons
ible self-government in India with
the Imperial-. British Government
reserving control of finances, for
eign affairs, and defense.
(4) Extension of the voting fran
chise in India and the lifting of re
strictions based on religion and
caste.
(5) Establishment of a legislature
of two houses modelled along the
line of the Congress of the United
States.
(6) Encouragement of Indians to
settle their own communal problems.
(7) Uninterrupted continuance of
negotiations to settle the details of
the new government.
The l-ound table delegates had ful
some praise for the work which had
been accomplished in London but
there still remains the fateful issue
as to whether restless India would
grasp the hand Mac Donald extended.
The Prime Minister opened wide
the door for Mahatma Gandhi and
the other Indian radicals to come
in on the negotiations which must
continue in India until details of
the new constitution are worked
out.
