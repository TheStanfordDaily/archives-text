# SEE MAINTENANCE OF LOWER DIVISION IN $100,000 GRANT
## 
### 
No further restriction of Lower
Division entrants is threatened in
the recent $100,000 grant to Stanford
by the General Education Board,
according lo Professor E. E. Robin
son, head of the independent study
plan and history department.
On the contrary, since individual
study is to be extended to first
quarter freshmen, it is more than
ever important to have a large en
tering class from which the most
resourceful students may be chosen
for intensive work.
Changing state conditions, with
the rapid springing up of junior
colleges, and the widening transi
tion from high school, have seemed
to dictate Stanford's policy of in
creased entrance at the junior year.
"We may anticipate a stress upon
good work in the lower division as
a result of the new grant," said
Robinson.
Whether the junior collcge plays
a worthwhile part is to be deter
mined by observation of the inde
pendent study plan over the com
ing five-year period.
"In any case, the emphasis will be
on the student rather than on the
subject," declared Robinson. "Its ob
ject is to permit of academic enter
prise as notable as that in the pro
fessional fields."
