# Indian Debaters Land Victorious From Isle Tour
## McClintock, Bryant Return To Campus Today 
### 
With a record of two wins in afc
many debates, Daniel Bryant and
Robert McClintock of the Stanford
forensic squad arrive in San Fran
cisco today on the Matson liner
Maui, after a debating and public
speaking trip to the Hawaiian Is
lands.
Both debates were with the Uni
versity of Hawaii, and both were
won by audience decision. On Janu
ary 9 they took the affirmative of
the question, "Resolved, that the
chain store does more harm than
good to the community." The Stan
ford team then supported the nega
tive of the question, "Resolved, that
the principal of democracy has been
tried and found wanting," on Mon
day of last week.
In addition to these forensic con
tests, the two Stanfordites made
several speeches. McClintock spoke
to the Advertising Club and over
the Honolulu Star-Bulletin's radio
station, on the English debating tour
of the all-California team. Bryant
spoke to the Rotary Club on "Stan
ford University."
McClintock and Bryant sailed
from Los Angeles on December 27,
arriving in the Islands January 3,
where they were welcomed by Gov
ernor-General Judd and were
guests at an "open house" at his
residence. During their eleven-day
stay in Honolulu, the Stanford de
baters were guests of the University
of Hawaii Union.
