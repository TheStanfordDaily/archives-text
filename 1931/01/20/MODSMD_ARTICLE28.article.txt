# SPEED ATTACK STRESSED FOR U.C. HOOP TILT
## Defensive Work In Trojan Game Satisfactory Says Coach REYNOLDS IS PRAISED 
### Jack Jernegan 
Decidedly dissatisfied with the at
tack displayed by the Cardinal
cagers up to the present time, Coach
John Bunn yesterday opened an in
tensive campaign to put more pep
into the Stanford basketball offensive
which he will pit against Nibs Price's
California quintet next Saturday.
With this object in view, Bunn
directed a return to the funda
mentals of dribbling, passing, and
shooting in yesterday's practice ses
sion. He emphasized speed and snap
throughout the workout and kept the
I athletes humping.
Improvement Noted
Although conceding that the Red
skins showed some improvement in
their second contest with U.S.C. dur
ing the past week-end, Bunn de
clares that the team will have to dc
-1 velop a good deal more drive in
i breaking through on offense if they
are to have a chance against Cali
fornia.
"With the exception of that U.S.C.
' game we haven't been penetrating
the defenses of the different schools
; as we should," Bunn said yesterday.
1 "Our offense has been the same all
season, scoring approximately the
j same number of points against each
opponent, and not improving.
Tough Tilt Seen
The Indian coach expects the Cali
fornia defense to prove harder for
his men to penetrate than that of
U.S.C. The Bears play a zone sys
tem which Bunn declares to be much
more effective than the Trojan's
man-to-man defense. Scores of con
ference games show that U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. each got through the
Stanford basket protection for more
, points in every game than the same
quintets gathered in their tilts with
California.
This indicates that Price has
, worked up a tougher defense than
Stanford s, and the Indians arc pret
, ty good in that department them
-1 selves.
Defense Satisfactory
However, Coach Bunn is'well sat
isfied with the performance of his
own men on defense, declaring that
, they functioned quite smoothly
1 enough Saturday night when the
i Trojans could get only two or three
chances for "set-up" shots.
He also got a lot of encourage
ment out of the way Captain Mike
Reynolds came through in the same
contest. If the other men on the
team can drive in under the basket
and connect with their shots as well
as Mike did Saturday, the Redshirt
mentor will feel easy about the com
ing battle with the Bears.
