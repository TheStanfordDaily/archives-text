# STANFORD, $15â€”WISCONSIN. $7
## 
### 
Stanford's health service costs every student $5 a quarter or $15
lor the school year. The I'niversity of Wisconsin's health service,
and it seems to Ik- a far superior service, costs every student there
S.VSO a semester, or S7 for the school year of nine months.
At Wisconsin, "Whenever illness occurs, the medical staff is
ready to meet the need fit* the individual.\ The Ambulatory Clinic
maintains an adequate staff of physicians and nurses for the needs
of all students able to report in person. A member of the staff will
see emergency cases at any hour with an appreciation of the grave
possibilities of minor illness. All student illnesses at rooms should
be reported promptly. A telephone message to the Student Health
Service will secure a physician at any hour of the day or night."
The Wisconsin health service likewise operates "the Student
Infirmary, a modern building which provides facilities for the care
of students who are confined to bed or who need nursing attention,
h is desirable that all such students avail themselves of these privi
leges rather than to remain in their rooms."
Although paying less than half the medical fee charged a Stan
ford student, a student at the I'niversity of Wisconsin is provided
with complete dispensary and infirmary service and. in addition,
with physicians' calls to his room whenever necessary.
Stanford, collecting as it does $5 a quarter from every student,
might look to Wisconsin in the matter of providing a more satis
factory health service. It has already been suggested that fees paid
to the Stanford I lospital and health services be used for the operation
of a student infirmary and a student dispensary, functioning together
to furnish campus men and women with a 24-hour-a-day medical
service.
Stanford students are still paying $15 every nine months to the
hospital fund, enough to insure them of a complete health service.
So the question may be asked again today, why aren't they getting
that service?
