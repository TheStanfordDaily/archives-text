It won't be long now, breathe the Five Hundred in relief as
formal rushing closes tomorrow night.
The sorority women are counting their chickens for Thursday,
the night of pledging; and the freshmen are running around like
pullets with their heads off. Roble and Row are awake in their
roosts all night with much cackling and ruffling of feathers.
But whether some of the eggs fail to hatch, whether some turn

out to be ugly ducklings, whether the incubation is highly produc-1
tive or not — it matters not. A century from now, the five hundred ,
thickens may still he in the Stanford coop but they will have diffi
culty in remembering what chicks were hatched in what nest and
what chicks stayed in the Roble nest in January of 1931.
All — Plymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds — end up alike on
the hooks of the poultryman's shop.
