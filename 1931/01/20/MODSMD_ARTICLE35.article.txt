( larence Little, former president of the I nivcrsity of Michigan,
recently stated in an address, "It is a shame that parents and tlie j
state spend large sums of money educating girls who come to col-1
lege only to meet marriageable men."
Apparently college love is not confined to the State of Michigan.
( )nr estimable contemporary, Chaparral, once unearthed statistics
which indicated that (o per cent of Stanford's feminity married '
Stanford men. P.ut what of it?
It i-- <jllite possible that even the most frivolous young lady might
absorb a little education while engaged in her Four-year man hunt.
She might even learn almost much as her more serious, scholarly

hunting ground. There are several places worse than a campus for
girls to seek husbands.
Periodically the cry is raised that college students are not mar
rying, and that as a result, civilization will topple. So perhaps it I
will pay, in the long run, to subsidize matrimonial bureaus for edit- ;
(ated young people.
