ESCAPE—At the California Theatre,
Mayfield.
Except for occasional dramatic I
pauses, unnecessary rendition of |
"God Save the King,"' prolonged
trilling of bucolically-inclined barn- [
yarders, and many shots of a run
ning crowd—this English-made pic- ,
ture is infinitely more enjoyable !
than most of the adjective-laden i
drivel handed to the moviegoer in j
the United States.
Sir Gerald Du Maurier plays Matt [
unusually well and is well .supported J
by Austin Trevor and Edna Best.
Basil Dean directed the production, j
using Galsworthy's lines until the
finale when he went slightly "Holly
wood" by sounding a note, the vi- '
brations of which, if measured in .
terms of color, would resemble rose
—old rose.
A thoroughly entertaining produc- '
tion. —J. S. S.
BORN TO BE—By Talbot Gordon, |
and PAUL ROBESON, NEGRO. I
By Mrs. Eslanda (J. Robeson. A
comparison. (At Palo Alio Book ;
Shop.)
fl seems a well-established canon
of biographical • literature that in
teresting books are written about
sinners, and boring books about
saints. Take, for example, these vol
umes about two Negroes who rose I

| to fame from obscurity.
In "Paul Robeson, Negro," Mrs.
i Robeson tries to show that her
[ "hubby'' has been a paragon of all
j the virtues and all the talents.
I Wasn't he the greatest all around
athlete and scholar ever to darken
i the halls of Rutgers? Then, as an
i actor and singer of world-wide
I fame, modest and unassuming isn't
j "Robey" a credit to his people and
a living example of what the Negro
' can contribute to civilization?
"Born To Bo," by Talbot Gordon,
lis nothing more than the auto
! biography of a self-confessed but
unrepentant sinner, who accidentally
| carved a niche in (he Hall of Col
ored Fame as Pullman porter, ehauf
| feur, chef, doorman, singer—to name
only his respectable trades. Gordon
I doesn't care one whoop about rais
! ing himself or his race in the eyes
!of the Whites, but of telling the
| story of his life as naturally and as
j well as he can; so it has a genuine
I flavor of truth, and is interesting.
As a result, though, we may ad-
I mire Robeson for his really remark -
| able achievements. Gordon, with his
frank enjoyment of life, his vulgar-
I ity and vitality,, seems more repre-
I sentative of the true -Negro than
i does the highly talented and vir
; tuous person Mrs. Robeson has
I painted for us. —W. C. R.
