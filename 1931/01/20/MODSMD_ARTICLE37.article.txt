# Cabbages and Things

It has just occurred to us to re
mark that intramural basketball is
failing in its purpose of fostering
good feeling between living groups.
As a reform measure, we would like
to propose intramural prize fight.*
Even a return to the intramural
stabbing matches, once known as
exchange dinners, might be an im
provement.
About this time of year, all the
campus would-be authors begin
looking distantly pained with in
spiration. (Of course you can't be
sux-e that it's not just a rushing
lunch disagreeing with a girl—but
you can usually tell.) Anyhow, one
of our acquaintances was boasting
of his ability, saying that he's been
writing for several of the foremost
magazines in the country. But his
roommate told us later that none
of them ever came—so he's still
writing.
Poor humor—but fortunately we
don't often feel this sleepy.
Who was it who said that the
wages of sin is syntax?
Once upon a time, long, long ago,

1 we were a happy little family of
professors and slewdents, trying
hard to get along, and doing pretty
well at it. But now, even the teach
ing staff has taken to witticism- The
result is wearing on the family dis
' position.
Someone laughed, yesterday, when
| one of the.se said, "In vino Veritas"
(meaning "truth is in wine," or
something equally tasteless, Gene
vieve) and accused Harvard Uni
versity of owning that as its motto.
The laugher didn't know that they
J have real wine back there, mebbe.
i The joke is that Stanford was partly
i financed in its earlier days by the
! profits of a local brewery. Who
j wants a motto, anyway?
And now someone questions,
"Why don't the pretty girls go
I to college?" Why should they?
They learn too much in high
school.
After today's efforts, we probably
I won't be allowed to pester you
I again. We'll "take all punishment
like a man. We're used to it, and a
| rolling pin gathers no moths—in the
1 head of an expert.
