A QUESTION OF ATTIRE
The Editor, Sir:
The highly commendable attitude
of Mr. Mellinkoff of your "Looking
Around" column in regard to the
self-expressive attire of the Stan- j
ford male as compared with the |
"repressed" habit of the Eastern
collegiate, has been noted with in- j
terest by a Swarthmorean.
In this connection two facts may
be set down. It is of anthropological
interest that meals in the East are
still enjoyed as a function rather
than as a picnic. Also, amusingly
enough, some of those polite cus
toms which, however antiquated,
seem to make the world a pleasanter â€¢

place in which to live, are still
practiced by the effete inhabitants
of those less propitious climes.
The gentlemen in question who
were requested to leave the dining
room at Swarthmore because of lack
of coats were probably the advance
guard of a superior Western cul
ture, which, with the unques
tioned (?) supremacy of Western
football in the near future, we may
expect to see introducing vests or
suspenders, semi-weekly shaves,
and dirty shirts at the most fastidi
ous gatherings.
Yours for fewer baths and filthier
cords.
