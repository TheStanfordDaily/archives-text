### Darrell Amyx 
A PROFESSOR ATTEMPTS
SUICIDE
nto the gloom of the deepening
night,
with a tear, and a sop, and a sigh, j
\s a man who has lost every vision :
of hope,
and is longing to perish—so I.
Vith a heart that must mourn for
the days that are gone,
and for pleasures entombed in the j
past,
<Jow I leave the vain phantom to j
mock other fools—
I relinquish the struggle at last, j
low brief is the bliss, how elusive !
the joys,
and how bitter the woes that are J
rife,
low sweet the decision to close the ,
account,
and to end this fiasco called life.

• But I must go back to the dregs and |
the lees,
to the sickening glare of the sun, j
I W'th even my bid for oblivion
thwarted:
I've gone and forgotten the gun.
