### Abe Mellinkoff 
A famous actor speaking at the |
University of Pennsylvania, claims !
j that a college education leads to j
' sophistication.
While sophistication may have
I originated on Park Avenue, it is the
American college that has nurtured
; and developed the "Murad art."
Sophistication is that some
thing that makes it possible for
one to say anything 011 grounds
of membership in the new intcl
ligensia and do anything by vir
tue of having adopted the scien
tific standard in place of Mid-
Victorian ideals.
A co-ed at the University of
Michigan who wears a fraternity pin
is liable for a fine of $50 or six days
in jail.
Al that rate, a woman who
wears different fraternity pins
on different evenings is likely
to receive capital punishment;
but she really would deserve a
Nobel prize for something or
other.

The president of Rollins Univer
sity claims that the "cut and dried"
lecture and quiz system makes
sponges out of the students.
But even a sponge lives on the
j water that passes through it; and
many students can't do that with
their education. The reason is that
most courses do not even go in one
i ear and out the other but instead
pass over the student like rain over
plate glass.
The dean of men at the Uni
versity of Illinois is firmly
against "public petting." The
| dean is probably correct.
But what many would like to |
know is whether the dean is
against the principle of petting
or merely its public perform
ance.

A lecturer at Michigan State Col
lege feels that familiarity is a form
1 of inferiority.
That may be so but anyone not
i skilled in the mystic art of psychol
| ogy might feel that the individual j
j who calls the governor by his first
1 name, "drops in to talk things over
; with the prexy," and dates all the
; campus queens on two hours' no
t tice is suffering from a superiority
} and not inferiority complex.
At the University of Minnesota,
1 rushees must pay for their own
1 meals. This plan should prove popu
lar with fraternities everywhere. Al-
I though it might mean less persons
I going "row," it would save worried
; house managers from wasting meals
j on "poor prospects."
