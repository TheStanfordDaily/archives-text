WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
After the great experiment over
the week-end to make basketball
players official-conscious, a lew re
marks anent the boys (wo use the
word advisedly) with the whistles
and the white knickers, in general,
and the Indian-Trojan games in par
ticular, might not be amiss.
Sixty-three personal fouls
during the course of eighty min
utes of basketball might ap
pear .at first glance, like very
picayunish refereeiug, but any
one who saw the games knows
differently. Had Messrs. Kay and
Fit/.pat rick called everything
they saw, the total would have
been 1(>3; if they had called
everything that happened —
words fail us.
Basketball, with its rules covering
charging, blocking, overguarding
from the rear, and so on, lends itself
easily to over-officiating, especially
where members of the opposing
teams are "gunning" for each other,
as in Friday's and Saturday's en
counters. Had Kay and Fitzpatrick
so chosen, they might have kept
their whistles shrilling incessantly.
Also, because the referee can
not see everything that the spec
tator can, and because he can
see some things that the spec
tator can't, a rabidly partisan
crowd, such as the one that fre
quents our air-cooled pavilion,
is quick to condemn. There was,
for example, the incident on
Saturday night when Capps,
Trojan guard, crossed behind
Cordry, and in doing so, tripped
over the Indian forward's foot.
It was, to the galleryite, obvious
ly an accident, but Kay gave
Capps a free throw, having ap
parently witnessed nothing save
the Trojan skidding on his ear.
On the other hand, there was the
sad case of Gardner, Southern Cali
fornia forward. Those who remem
ber the third game of the 1930 S.C.
series, played here, will recall that
friend Gardner, by dint of falling
to the floor and simulating great
pain every time a red jersey came
within three feet of him, collected
something like eight free throws
during the evening.
Some of his dry-tank dives were
so obvious that the crowd booed,
long and earnestly, which resulted
in Referee Herb Dana awarding him
an extra shot because of the spec
tators' conduct. This year, however,
was different.
Either Kay or Fitzpatrick had
wised up to Gardner when S.C.
played U.C. the week previous,
or his acting was faulty, because,
although he bounced off the
hardwood often enough to dis
courage a less sturdy soul, the
only free throws he got were
legitimate ones.
As a matter of fact, he was really
knocked flat in a very uncouth
manner half a dozen times, but the
officials, apparently thinking, "Oh.
it's just that Gardner boy again,"
didn't do anything about it. Which
ought to be a moral lesson of some
kind.
In summary, then, this: Kay
and Fitzpatrick are officials who
call 'em as they see 'em, but
who hesitate to slow up the
game too much by over-zealous
use of their authority. They will
make mistakes, of course, but
in the long run the number of
boots will not favor any one
team. And you can't get more
than that.

Also, because the referee can
not see everything that the spec
tator can, and because he can
see some things that the spec
tator can't, a rabidly partisan
crowd, such as the one that fre
quents our air-cooled pavilion,
is quick to condemn. There was,
for example, the incident on
Saturday night when Capps,
Trojan guard, crossed behind
Cordry, and in doing so, tripped
over the Indian forward's foot.
It was, to the galleryite, obvious
ly an accident, but Kay gave
Capps a free throw, having ap
parently witnessed nothing save
the Trojan skidding on his ear.
On the other hand, there was the
sad case of Gardner, Southern Cali
fornia forward. Those who remem
ber the third game of the 1930 S.C.
series, played here, will recall that
friend Gardner, by dint of falling
to the floor and simulating great
pain every time a red jersey came
within three feet of him, collected
something like eight free throws
during the evening.
Some of his dry-tank dives were
so obvious that the crowd booed,
long and earnestly, which resulted
in Referee Herb Dana awarding him
an extra shot because of the spec
tators' conduct. This year, however,
was different.
Either Kay or Fitzpatrick had
wised up to Gardner when S.C.
played U.C. the week previous,
or his acting was faulty, because,
although he bounced off the
hardwood often enough to dis
courage a less sturdy soul, the
only free throws he got were
legitimate ones.
As a matter of fact, he was really
knocked flat in a very uncouth
manner half a dozen times, but the
officials, apparently thinking, "Oh.
it's just that Gardner boy again,"
didn't do anything about it. Which
ought to be a moral lesson of some
kind.
In summary, then, this: Kay
and Fitzpatrick are officials who
call 'em as they see 'em, but
who hesitate to slow up the
game too much by over-zealous
use of their authority. They will
make mistakes, of course, but
in the long run the number of
boots will not favor any one
team. And you can't get more
than that.

WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
After the great experiment over
the week-end to make basketball
players official-conscious, a lew re
marks anent the boys (wo use the
word advisedly) with the whistles
and the white knickers, in general,
and the Indian-Trojan games in par
ticular, might not be amiss.
Sixty-three personal fouls
during the course of eighty min
utes of basketball might ap
pear .at first glance, like very
picayunish refereeiug, but any
one who saw the games knows
differently. Had Messrs. Kay and
Fit/.pat rick called everything
they saw, the total would have
been 1(>3; if they had called
everything that happened —
words fail us.
Basketball, with its rules covering
charging, blocking, overguarding
from the rear, and so on, lends itself
easily to over-officiating, especially
where members of the opposing
teams are "gunning" for each other,
as in Friday's and Saturday's en
counters. Had Kay and Fitzpatrick
so chosen, they might have kept
their whistles shrilling incessantly.
