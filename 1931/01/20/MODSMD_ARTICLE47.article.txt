# Yearling Cage Squad Undergoes Reorganization
## BUNN BLUE OVER POOR SHOWING OF FRESHMEN TEAM Jenkins Rejoins Hoopsters; California Clash Next On Tap 
### Lowell Cox 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team is back where it started at the
, first of the season.
Coach John Bunn yesterday be
-1 gan the work of rebuilding the
team from the ground up, lollowing
the collapse of the yearlings in their
week-end games with Menlo Junior
College and Palo Alto High School,
j "We're beginning all over," Coach
Bunn said at the conclusion of yes
' terday's workout, which was fea
, tured by an intensive drill on fun
! da mentals.
The Cardinal coach characterized
the work of the frosh as '"disgust
ing," pointing out that following the
first half of the first evening's game,
the babes failed utterly to come up
to the standard they set for them
selves in previous games.
"The opposition was always two
jumps ahead, mentally and physi
cally," Bunn said. "The freshmen
j seemed to have forgotten all they
| had learned."
Jenkins Rejoins Squad
Jenkins has rejoined the squad,
and his height is expected to ma
terially strengthen the Papoose
quintet on defense, their weakest
i point.
Just how the frosh will line up
!in the California tilt at Oakland
j Saturday night is problematical.
I Jenkins can be expected to start at
I one guard position, but Coach Bunn
! has decided on no definite lineup
j changes as yet.
One thing is certain: the fresh
man hoop schedule will be consider
ably shortened next season. Bunn
believes that this year's heavy
I schedule has been largely responsi
| ble for the failure of the first-year
| men to thoroughly master the ele
-1 mentary principles of basketball
j technique.
For the proper functioning of his
1 system, the new coach desires to
i thoroughly ground his players in
1 the fundamentals of the game dur
ing their first year, so that they will
! give no trouble . during varsity
I years.
