# CONQUERING CONGER
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
How would you like to be able to
l say that you had beaten Nurmi,
! Wide, Peltzer, Purje, and Dr. Paul
Martin, five noted foreign runners?
j Ray Conger can say all that, but he's
not the type that goes around boast
ing of his victories on the cinder
: path or the boards.
However, Conger is one of the
best mile runners in the world, cer
! taintly indoors, and his stirring
bursts of speed at the finish of his
i races have carried him to the front
| before the above-mentioned foreign
! quintet as well as Lloyd Hahn, Or
vall Martin, Leo Lermond, Paul
Rekers, Rufus Kizer, and others in
| this country.
Ray started off his 1931 indoor
! season with a bang on Saturday,
j January 11, when he won the spe
! cial invitation 1,000-yard run at the
| Thirteenth Regiment Armory,
Brooklyn, in 2:17 3-5.
Runs Like an Artist
Conger has been running long
j enough now to be able to judge pace
j as well as anybody, and it is a treat
i to watch his well-planned and per
fectly executed efforts in this line.
I The lean greyhound of the Illinois

Athletic Club is an artist at run
ning, and don't be surprised if he
keeps on improving and cuts quite
a figure in the 1500 meter run at
the Los Angeles Olympics next
year.
I well remember Conger's thril
ling last-minute dash to victory in
the final Olympic championships at
Boston in 1928, when he set a new
U.S. 1500-meter record of 3:55, and
defeated such stars as Sid Robin
son, Nick Carter, Orvall, Martin,
Joe Sivak, Rufus Kizer, and Bill
McNitf (the famous Pennsylvania
star, then in high school). Ray was
a dismal failure in the 1500 meters
at Amsterdam, however, but he had
plenty of good company as far as
American runners were concerned
(always excepting Ray Barbuti).
Many Good Times
He defeated Nurmi in 1929 in an
indoor mile in 4:17 2-5, and last
March won from Martin of Switzer
land in 4:15 1-5. His outdoor A.A.U.
championships include the afore
mentioned 3:55, 1500 meters in the
final Olympic trials in 1928, a mile in
4:23 3-5 in 1927, and in 4:19 4-5 in
1930.
