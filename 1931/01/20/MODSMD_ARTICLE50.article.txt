# PAPOOSE TURNOUT FOR BALL SEASON IS UNSATISFACTORY
## 
### 
I Molding a first-clas freshman
baseball team out of 14 players is
the task confronting Murray Cudde
baek, coach of the yearling team.
Out of this meagre squad Coach
Cuddeback has only three men that
j have made impressive records as
' prep school players. Stanley Ander
' son, a Kingsburg High School star,
has shown up in preliminary prac-
I tices as a first rate pitcher.
James Massey, who is now play
ing basketball on the frosh team,
| is also a likely looking prospect,
having playfed catcher on the Eureka
High team. Bob Maentz, who is like
wise engaged with basketball at
present, will probably turn out for
the shortstop position later.
Recent rains have prevented Cud
i deback from putting the players
through any intensive workouts. If
the weather is favorable Coach Cud
i deback should know by next week
j whether the 1931 yearlings have the
! makings of a championship ball
! club.
