# SEAVER, LITTLE BOOST INDIAN'S GOLFING STOCK
## Benett Claims Men Equal Of Any College Team In Country 
### 
Hopes for a continuation of last
year's successful golf season are fly
ing high in the camp of the Stan
ford Indian.
The addition of "Chuck" Seaver
and Lawson Little, nationally known
golfers, and finalists in the National
Amateur Championships of 1930 and
1929, respectively, to the freshman
squad has boosted Stanford stock
considerably.
Both Eligible
Along with other frosh squad men,
both will be eligible for the Califor
nia Intercollegiate play at Del Monte
on April 3 and 4, and will augment
the varsity hopes in that tourney.
Before that date the only inter
collegiate tilts that the Stanford
teams will participate m will be
the California matches on March 6.
With men of Ihe calibre of Mal
colm McNaughton, Harry Eichel
berger, Warner Edmonds, and Her
man Hellman on the varsity squad,
small wonder that Stanford can
present a ten-man varsity team that
maintains an average four handicap
on their own home course.
Bennett Optimistic
At present Coach Gary Bennett is
of the opinion that Stanford pos
sesses an array of golf satellites un
matched by any Pacific Coast or
Eastern college.
Coach Bennett believes that if the
men play the matches in competition
that they are capable of in practice
sessions, nothing can prevent the
Farm from witnessing another un
defeated season in golf.
Trautman Lost
Right now the only blight on the
coach's horizon is the loss of Gerald
Trautman, third ranking freshman,
who is out for the season with a
broken ankle. However, there is an
abundance of sterling material to re
place him. Gene Brown, George Ed
monds, and Dave May are all first
year prospects that would warm the
heart of any coach and all have the
possibilities of blossoming into
stellar divot-diggers.
