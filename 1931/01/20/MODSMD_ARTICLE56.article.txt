# PROSPECTS GOOD FOR SUCCESSFUL STANFORD SEASON ON CINDER PATH
## 
### Francis Lloyd 
As far as the prospects for the j
cinder path are concerned, Stan- |
ford's 1931 varsity track team ap- :
pears well-equipped with material
to uphold its own against any com- !
petition in the country. In the field
events, however, the Indians are ap
parently below their usual standard |
—the broad-jump being the one ex
ception.
In fact in the cinder events the ,
Indians may prove to be better than
any Templeton-coached team of the
past, with the two-mile the only 1
race without at least one star per- j
former. Whether or not men can be i
developed in the field will have to i
depend on the hard work of the
men themselves and on genius
of the "boy coach."
Dyer Heads Sprinters
"Hec" Dyer, one of the most bril- j
liant performers in the country last
season in the sprints, will head the
list of the Indian dash men. Al- ,
though the blond speedster is strong i
in both events, the furlong is his j
specialty. Les Hables, Giberson, ;
Lornbardi, and Howell should be ;
able to take care of any seconds or
thirds which might be unoccupied, i
In the one-lap event Stanford has ;
a very fine performer in Ben East- 1
man, who clipped off 48.2 as a fresh
man last year. As running mates :
the San Mateo flash will have Ike
Hables and Maynor Shove—no mean
runners at their usual form. The
relay team, which will include Ben
Eastman, the Hables brothers, and
either Shove or Howell, may hang
up some new records before the
season comes to a close.
Hurdles Well Cared For
Captain "Podge" Smith, together
with Gordon and Nesbit, with the
addition of Brugman in the highs,
should cover the hurdling assign
ments without any trouble. Fullen

wider and Neikirk seem to be the j
point-winners in the half-mile at
this time, although Davenport or
Naylon might break in later. Allan j
Storms, who may also run the 880,
is the leading miler on the squad
and should fill the gap in this event '
which was so evident last year, i
Cooper and Wright complete the !
candidates for this race. Bob Brown j
will run the two-mile jaunt.
The? broad jump with West, a
better than 24-foot jumper, Butler,
and McDermott taking off the board,
will be the brightest spot in an
otherwise clouded field.
Blackmail Seems Out
Blackmail, the most consistent j
performer in the high jump, may '
not be able to compete because of i
an operation which he has recently
undergone. Johns in the pole vault 1
and Zuger in the javelin are the
"dark horses" of the squad. In them
lies the possibility of unexpected
points which may mean all the dif
ference between victory and defeat
this season.
In the weight events, however,
Cardinal prospects, though uncer
tain, are quite promising. One good
shot put artist from the 19'iO varsity
squad, George Grey, and two rapid
ly developing sophomores, Harry
Laborde and Nellie Gray, form a
group from which much is expected.
All Good Tossers
All three of these boys were put
ting the 16-pound ball out around
47 feet at the end of last season,
and it does not seem unlikely that
they will add a couple of feet to that
mark during the coming months.
Discus chances appear equally
good. Besides the above trio, all of
whom can toss the platter with
good results, there are Ray Tandy,
1930 football captain, Norman Mc-
Leod, and Bob Jones, all of last
year's varsity.

man last year. As running mates :
the San Mateo flash will have Ike
Hables and Maynor Shove—no mean
runners at their usual form. The
relay team, which will include Ben
Eastman, the Hables brothers, and
either Shove or Howell, may hang
up some new records before the
season comes to a close.
Hurdles Well Cared For
Captain "Podge" Smith, together
with Gordon and Nesbit, with the
addition of Brugman in the highs,
should cover the hurdling assign
ments without any trouble. Fullen

wider and Neikirk seem to be the j
point-winners in the half-mile at
this time, although Davenport or
Naylon might break in later. Allan j
Storms, who may also run the 880,
is the leading miler on the squad
and should fill the gap in this event '
which was so evident last year, i
Cooper and Wright complete the !
candidates for this race. Bob Brown j
will run the two-mile jaunt.
The? broad jump with West, a
better than 24-foot jumper, Butler,
and McDermott taking off the board,
will be the brightest spot in an
otherwise clouded field.
Blackmail Seems Out
Blackmail, the most consistent j
performer in the high jump, may '
not be able to compete because of i
an operation which he has recently
undergone. Johns in the pole vault 1
and Zuger in the javelin are the
"dark horses" of the squad. In them
lies the possibility of unexpected
points which may mean all the dif
ference between victory and defeat
this season.
In the weight events, however,
Cardinal prospects, though uncer
tain, are quite promising. One good
shot put artist from the 19'iO varsity
squad, George Grey, and two rapid
ly developing sophomores, Harry
Laborde and Nellie Gray, form a
group from which much is expected.
All Good Tossers
All three of these boys were put
ting the 16-pound ball out around
47 feet at the end of last season,
and it does not seem unlikely that
they will add a couple of feet to that
mark during the coming months.
Discus chances appear equally
good. Besides the above trio, all of
whom can toss the platter with
good results, there are Ray Tandy,
1930 football captain, Norman Mc-
Leod, and Bob Jones, all of last
year's varsity.
As far as the prospects for the j
cinder path are concerned, Stan- |
ford's 1931 varsity track team ap- :
pears well-equipped with material
to uphold its own against any com- !
petition in the country. In the field
events, however, the Indians are ap
parently below their usual standard |
—the broad-jump being the one ex
ception.
In fact in the cinder events the ,
Indians may prove to be better than
any Templeton-coached team of the
past, with the two-mile the only 1
race without at least one star per- j
former. Whether or not men can be i
developed in the field will have to i
depend on the hard work of the
men themselves and on genius
of the "boy coach."
Dyer Heads Sprinters
"Hec" Dyer, one of the most bril- j
liant performers in the country last
season in the sprints, will head the
list of the Indian dash men. Al- ,
though the blond speedster is strong i
in both events, the furlong is his j
specialty. Les Hables, Giberson, ;
Lornbardi, and Howell should be ;
able to take care of any seconds or
thirds which might be unoccupied, i
In the one-lap event Stanford has ;
a very fine performer in Ben East- 1
man, who clipped off 48.2 as a fresh
man last year. As running mates :
the San Mateo flash will have Ike
