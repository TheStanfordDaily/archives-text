# BRITISH PRINCES ARRIVE IN SPAIN
## Royalty Delayed on Way to South America 
### 
CORUNNA, Spain, Jan. 19. (TP)â€”
The Prince of Wales and his brother,
Prince George, reached here today
on the liner Oropesa, which is tak
ing them to South America, and
were welcomed in a brilliant recep
tion at the town hall. The Mayor
gave the British heir a handsomely
wrought box containing sand from
the battlefield on which General Sir
John Moore lost his life.
Afterward the royal visitors went
to the General's tomb and laid the
cornerstone of a memorial to him at
Montelvina. Then the party left for
Santiago whence it will continue by
automobile to Vigo, rejoining the
Oropesa there this evening.
The two Princes were many hours
late in reaching Santander, where
they found the Oropesa, hauled up
to a dock ready to begin the trans
atlantic trip. From Coruna the ves
sel will proceed to Hamilton, Ber
muda, and Kingston, Jamaica. The
.royal passengers will touch Central
America and go on down the west
South American coast.
The Princes' trouble began late
Saturday night when their train
was held up 30 miles below Bor
deaux by the derailment of a north
bound train from the Spanish fron
tier. French railroad officials at
Bayonne sent a special train north
to pick them up and carry them to
Hendaye.
There, already four hours late,
they transferred to motor cars, be
ginning a dangerous ride over sloppy
mountain roads to Santander, water
ing place of the Spanish kings. At
Bilbao the automobile occupied by
the Prince of Wales careened into
that in which Prince George was
riding hut no one was hurt.
The two Princes flew Friday to
Paris, spending the remainder of
the day and Saturday there. They
will not return to England until
late in March.
