Eastern and Chuck Weesner this af
ternoon at 2 o'clock on the varsity

J championship of the University.

I ford, each of these four holds down
i a position among the first five rank
ing Indian netmen.
Close Match Expected
j Easton and Weesner, by reason of
j their excellent teamwork, are slight
l ly favored over their rivals, but if
j individual prowess means anything
; in a doubles encounter, Gledhill and
j Coughlin, who rank one and four,
i respectively, certainly stand more
j than an even chance of trouncing
j their opponents, who rank two and
! five.
Stanford, being in the southern
! division of the Pacific Coast Con
i ference, vies with California,
j U.C.L.A.. and U.S.C. for tennis
