# BELGIAN COLLEGE EXPELS STUDENTS, DISHONESTY RARE
## Dismissal Prevents Students Registering At Other Universities 
### 
Permanent expulsion is the pen
alty for cheating in Belgian univer
sities, according to Dr. J. D. H. Don
nay, graduate of the University of
Liege, and at present instructor in
Romanic languages here.
Dr. Donnay, who came to America
;,nd Stanford in 1925 as a Fellow of
the C.R.B. Foundation (established
by the Commission for Relief in
Belgium, of which Herbert Hoover
was chairman), is extremely inter
ested in American educational sys
tems, and expresses emphatic dis
approval of the leniency shown vio
lators of the Honor Code.
General Expulsion Imposed
Not only is an offending Belgian
student prevented from re-entering
the university from which he has
been expelled, but he is also pre
vented from registering in any other
slate university in the country, Dr.
Donnay explained.
The chance for cheating is very
slight, however, as most of the ex
aminations are oral. With such ex
aminations, observes Dr. Donnay,
neither the proctor nor the honor
system is needed.
Severe Penalty Needed
The Honor Code, as it is in opera
tion at Stanford, is a fine and pos
sible means of control if enforce
ment includes only dismissal or ac
quittal, thinks Dr. Donnay. Other
wise, its practicality is "seriously
open to question."
â€¢The Doctor related many instances
of what he terms "'beautiful exam
ples of loyalty to this tradition" on
the part of some of his students
here. One, who badly needed his
units for graduation and was very
low in his subject, deliberately
handed in a blank sheet rather than
dishonor himself by cheating.
