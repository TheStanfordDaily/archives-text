# BOXING TEAM TAKES REGULAR WORK OUT
## 
### 
With the University championship
bouts just two weeks off, the boxing
squad went through its regular
Monday afternoon workout yester
day under the dii'ection of Coach
Harry Maloney and his assistant,
Myron Schall.
Bill Harding, winner in the light
heavyweight division of the novice
tournament on the campus last au
tumn, has turned out for the squad.
Maloney plans to develop him into
a heavyweight for the team. The
coach spent some time sparring with
him in the ring yesterday.
Vance Rogers and Fred Glover,
experienced men from last year's
varsity, looked well in a one-round
encounter inside the ropes. Both
these boys, Maloney says, are im
proving steadily and should make
good showings for Stanford in the
intercollegiate bouts this season.
