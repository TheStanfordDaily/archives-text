## United States Attitude On International Peace Work Attacked 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19. (/P> â€”
Carrie Chapman Catt, veteran ad
vocate of world peace, opening to
day the sixth annual conference on
cause and cure of war, defined what
she termed ' the one cause, the one
cure."
Conference Results
From countless definitions sub
mitted Mrs. Catt said in the address
prepared lor the initial session, the
studies of the eleven women's or
ganizations in the conference had
simmered down to this:
"Competition in armament build
ing is the chief cause of war."
"Pacts of peace and of disarma
ment are the chief cures of war."
Facts Recognized
All nations now recognize these
facts, Mrs. Catt said, whereas six
years ago there was "a veritable
mental and political chaos on the
subject of peace and war."
From James G. McDonald, chair
man of tjje Foreign Policy Associa
tion, came an assertion that the
United States had a "checkered
record" last year in the path toward
peace and Europe took "a step back
ward for nearly every step forward."
