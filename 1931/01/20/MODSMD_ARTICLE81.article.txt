# FOILS SQUAD TRAINS FOR U.C. ENCOUNTER
## 
### 
With the varsity fencing competi
tion with California scheduled for '
the first week in March, the squad j
is now concerned with rounding into j
the best shape possible for this all- !
important meet.
California this year promises to
offer the local swordsmen another j
interesting evening. Last year repre
sentatives of the Farm barely eked
cut a 13 to 12 victory over the ;
Berkeley aggregation.
This year's Indian team promises i
a better showing, due to the fact j
that with last year's veterans and 1
several members of last season's j
champion freshman squad on hand, |
a stronger array of foils artists is I
representing Stanford. Led for the
second time by Jack Snyder, the j
team of ten members feels confi
dent of a strong showing against the
Berkeley foil-wielders.
