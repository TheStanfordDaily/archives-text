# A.S.S.U. Heads Say Code Needs Faculty Support
## Ex Committee Recommendations for Preventing Honor System Violations Include Using Publicity Of Provisions; Proctors on Request POLO, CAGE AWARD AMENDMENTS PROPOSED 
### 
rOLLOWING up the recent intense discussion of the Honor Code situa
tion, (he Executive Committee of the associated students unanimously
concluded last night that responsibility for present lax conditions rests as
much on the faculty as on the student body, and that faculty co-operation
is essential to any improvement. Four specific recommendations were
suggested as bases for a joint movement of faculty and student officials
to put a definite stop to violations of the Code, and to reduce cheating

at examinations to the lowest pos
sible minimum. They are:
1) That a policy be adopted by
the faculty whereby any member
of a class may request the instructor
at any time, during or before an
examination, to place a proctor in
charge of the examination.
2) That every student be re
quired to write a signed statement
at the close of his paper that he has
not given or received aid during
the examination, and that no paper
be corrected which has not such a
pledge on it.
Instructors To Assist
!1) That the instructors shall di
rect the provisions and ideals of the
Honor System to the attention of
the classes before each examination.
4) That placards or notices stat
ing the principles of the system be
placed in all rooms before and dur
ing examinations.
It was the general conclusion of
the Committee that the Honor Code
was a valuable institution, and that
its- maintenance should be fought for
zealously. The manner of enforcing
the provisions of the Code consti
tuted the chicf problem, although it
was held by the majority that the
ideal of any such measures should
be that of educating the student
body to a clearer undestanding of
the principles of the system.
Divided on Penalties
The members of the legislative
body were divided on the severity
of penalties to be imposed on vio
lators of the codc, some holding that
expulsion without compromise was
essential, others that less severe
punishment would lead to correction
without complete disgrace and its
accompanying evils. It was argued
by many that violations could be
checked only by a rigid enforce
ment, and punishment of the entire
class for failure to report the cheat
ing, as well as the cheaters them
selves.
Various personal ways by which
faculty members could remind in
dividual students of their duties to
their fellows were suggested, one of
them being that departmental heads
might discuss th matter with each
junior entering his department.
Propose More Awards
Proposals to grant more lettei's to
Ihe varsity and polo teams were
drawn up in the form of amend
ments to the A.S.S.U. constitution,
which will be submitted to student
vote in the February elections. The
minimum total playing time limit in
the California basketball series
necessary for block letters is re
duced from 30 to 20 minutes in the
proposal.
One-third of the total playing time
of all polo matches would be neces
sary for a circle award in tha sport
if the amendments are accepted, as
against the present requirement of
one-half of all contests.
