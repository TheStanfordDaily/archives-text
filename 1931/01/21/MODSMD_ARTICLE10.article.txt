# STANFORD MOTHERS INSTRUCT "ROUGHS" IN DOMESTIC ARTS
## Self-Supporting Men Taught Cooking, Gardening 
### 
i For years there have been, at
Stanford, schools of education, law,
letters, engineering, social sciences,
and what have you, and all of them
! have been heard of at one time or
another. But now there's a new one
â€”one which, until now, has never
seen the light of print.
It's the Stanford Mothers' Club
school, instituted to teach Stanford
mep cooking, gardening, and house
i cleaning. Under the personal direc
i tion of Stanford mothers, men are
i given practical instruction which
prepares them for earning a part of
! their expenses.
Classes are necessarily limited in
j size, and they have been completely
filled since their inauguration in Oc
tober of last year. As soon as a stu
dent has mastered his subject, he is
"graduated," and it is stated that
I there has been ready employment
for students fitted for such work.
A house-cleaning class is being
formed now, and men interested in
the work taught should see Mrs.
Irene Spenner, of the Appointment
: Service.
