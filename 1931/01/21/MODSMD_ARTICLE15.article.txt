## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 20. (/-im
probability of the outbreak of a
bitter price war over gasoline was
confirmed today by Charles Jacobs,
executive secretary of the Retail
Service Station Dealers Association
of San Francisco.
Because of the underselling tactics
of independent producers of gaso
line, Jacobs said the logical develop
ment, which probably could not be
deferred more than a few days, was
a counter movement by the major
oil companies.
"There is no question but the big
companies have taken an awful
wallop from the underselling of in
dependents, who have been market
ing at around 18 cents while the
standardized price was 21 cents,'"
Jacobs said. "They arc not going to
take this beating much longer."
