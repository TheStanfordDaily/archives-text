# CAPITAN, TIGRE HOOPMEN WIN MURAL GAMES
## Club Outfits Beat Chi Psi, Phi Sigma Kappa, 14-7, And 37 To 2 TWO TEAMS DEFAULT 
### Michael Crofoot 
El Tigre and El Capitan were the
victors over Phi Sigma Kappa and
the Chi Psi's respectively in the
only two games of the intramural
basketball tournament played last
night.
The other scheduled contests went
by default, Encina 2W getting credit
for their second win at the expense
of the Stanford Club, and Alpha
Tau Omega winning by forfeit from
Encina 4E.
Two Games Defaulted
Rolling up H7 points, El Tigre
handed the Phi Sigs, who garnered
but 2, the most one-sided defeat of
the tournament to date. This lop
sided score was not due to super
basketball. Tigre, made up of for
mer high school players, failed to
show either individual or group
brilliancy, but in comparison to the
Phi Sigs they look good. Petit and
Garibotto, of El Tigre, were high
point men with 10 apiece.
Starting out as if they were going
to gain an easy victory, the Chi
Psi's tired and lost a 14-7 decision
to El Capitan. Missing set-up shots
probably cost them the game.
Tonight's Schedule
In tonight's games Delta Chi is
scheduled to meet Sigma Chi in the
gym at 7 o'clock, and El Cuadro
takes on Phi Kappa Sigma in the
gym at 8. The former game has un
usual significance. Sigma Chi, last
year's champions, will be exhibiting
their 1931 model for the first time,
having won their opener by default.
With Joujon-Roche and Bob Gold
water from last year's quintet as a
nucleus, they should have another
good team, but the question to be
answered is whether they are strong
enough to give the all-star Sequoia
I team a fight for the championship.
Phi Kappa Sigma won their open
ing tilt from Thota Delta Chi, 20-15,
while El Cuadro dropped their first
tilt to the A.K.L.'s.
