# Stanford Has Fine Name In Hawaii, Says Debater
## 
### 
"Stanford is the outstanding uni
versity of the coast and stands next
to Harvard and Yale in national
prominence, in the opinion of the
people of Hawaii," said Robert Mc-
Clintock on his return to the cam
pus yesterday after a month's trip
to the Hawaiian Islands.
With his colleague, Daniel Bryant,
McClintock represented Stanford in
two debates with the University of
Hawaii, both of which the Stanford
men won by audience decision. These
debaters also made several speeches
over the radio and before various
clubs.
The foremost paper of Honolulu,
in its main editorial, referred to the
work of the Stanford speakers as
"spirited, vivid, and often humor
ous." They were given publicity in
the Honolulu papers on each of the
eleven days <>T their stay. The Stan
fordites met the numerous members

of the Stanford colony on the islands,
i end were entertained by A. Louis,
| jr., a member of the Stanford na
| tional board and a classmate of
! President Hoover.
On their arrival in Honolulu, Bry- '
| ant and McClintock were showered,
! with leis, and were given a recep
j tion at the home of Governor-Gen
, eral Judd. They were later pre-!
I sentcd with silk leis in the Stanford
colors, .and entertained at a number
dinners and dances.
As the result of a daily swim, the
Stanford debaters are both wearing
• a coat of tan. Their hotel was on
1 Waikiki Beach, and they made use ,
! of the opportunity to become adept
at riding the surfboard and outrigger
j canoe. They saw the scenic splen- !
j dors of the main island by night as
well as day, and spent a memorable ;
i evening swimming by moonlight in
■ the clear waters near the world-fa
| mous Diamond Head.
