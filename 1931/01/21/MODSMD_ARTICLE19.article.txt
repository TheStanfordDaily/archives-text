# Faculty Help Will Remedy Honor Code Situation: Dowell
## Honor Code "Should Be" Considered Privilege and Right Of Stanfordites, Not as Worn-Out Tradition States Men's Council Chairman 
### 
PACUI .iTY co-operation, combined with a sound, practical study of the
situation, will remedy the present degraded state of the honor code.
This is the belief of Virgil C. Dowell, chairman of Men's Council, ex
pressed in an interview yesterday.
''The honor system is regarded as a sort of legacy, a hand-down from
preceding college generations," said Dowell. "Instead, it should be looked
upon as a privilege. It is one of our rights as Stanford students.

> "Before 1912, a joint faculty-stu
dent control was in force. There was
continual friction between the two
groups. The students petitioned that
they be allowed to establish an
honor system, and with the aid of
Dr. Wilbur succeeded in obtaining
their end in spite of faculty reluc
tance to grant it.
Appreciation Then
"There was real appreciation of
the code then, and it worked. In
: (hose days students valued it; now
there is indifference, because there
1 is little realization of the fact that
it would mean a step backward to
re-establish the proctor system. Ex
aminations would then be under
supervision, and the dignity of the
honor system would be lost.
"I don't feel that the honor sys
tem is doomed. However, instead of
attempting to evolve a set of ab
! stract theories, we should try to ob
tain faculty co-operation and put
into effect a program of practical
! worth.
Instructors Should Aid
"I would suggest that instructors
distribute pledges, to be signed by
students at the beginning of exami
nations, that they will neither give
nor receive aid. Further to empha
; size the existence of the honor code,
instructors should outline, orally,
the principles involved in the
pledges. Those giving examinations
should share some of the responsi
bility for honorable conduct.
"It seems to be the opinion here
that one who turns in a cheater is
a despicable person. This is really
a false sense of chivalry and usually
lowers the grades of those v/ho al
low cheating to escape unreported.
If the student who knows of dis
hpnorable conduct won't report it to
the instructor, let him turn the of
fender in to the student council. It
is for his own protection that he
should do so."
Publicity To Be Given
After stressing the importance of
faculty influence in the actual work
ing out of the honor code, Dowel 1
said, "Lack of publicity in the past
several years seems to have caused
students to think that the system is
not being enforced. Hereafter, all
cases will be published in the Stan
ford Daily."
Any worthy suggestions for im
| proving the situation will be ac
[ cepted by the Stanford governing
bodies, according to Dowell.
"I haven't lost faith in student
principles," he said, "and I believe
there are as many honest students
j as there were back in 1912, but if
I there is no constructive action taken,
| and if we allow persistent delving
I into the abstract, we must go back
|to the proctor system. It will be
| completely lost if we let it slip from
us. We have a golden opportunity,
and we should take advantage of it."

us. We have a golden opportunity,
and we should take advantage of it."
PACUI .iTY co-operation, combined with a sound, practical study of the
situation, will remedy the present degraded state of the honor code.
This is the belief of Virgil C. Dowell, chairman of Men's Council, ex
pressed in an interview yesterday.
''The honor system is regarded as a sort of legacy, a hand-down from
preceding college generations," said Dowell. "Instead, it should be looked
upon as a privilege. It is one of our rights as Stanford students.

> "Before 1912, a joint faculty-stu
dent control was in force. There was
continual friction between the two
groups. The students petitioned that
they be allowed to establish an
honor system, and with the aid of
Dr. Wilbur succeeded in obtaining
their end in spite of faculty reluc
tance to grant it.
Appreciation Then
"There was real appreciation of
the code then, and it worked. In
: (hose days students valued it; now
there is indifference, because there
1 is little realization of the fact that
it would mean a step backward to
re-establish the proctor system. Ex
aminations would then be under
supervision, and the dignity of the
honor system would be lost.
"I don't feel that the honor sys
tem is doomed. However, instead of
attempting to evolve a set of ab
! stract theories, we should try to ob
tain faculty co-operation and put
into effect a program of practical
! worth.
Instructors Should Aid
"I would suggest that instructors
distribute pledges, to be signed by
students at the beginning of exami
nations, that they will neither give
nor receive aid. Further to empha
; size the existence of the honor code,
instructors should outline, orally,
the principles involved in the
pledges. Those giving examinations
should share some of the responsi
bility for honorable conduct.
"It seems to be the opinion here
that one who turns in a cheater is
a despicable person. This is really
a false sense of chivalry and usually
lowers the grades of those v/ho al
low cheating to escape unreported.
If the student who knows of dis
hpnorable conduct won't report it to
the instructor, let him turn the of
fender in to the student council. It
is for his own protection that he
should do so."
Publicity To Be Given
After stressing the importance of
faculty influence in the actual work
ing out of the honor code, Dowel 1
said, "Lack of publicity in the past
several years seems to have caused
students to think that the system is
not being enforced. Hereafter, all
cases will be published in the Stan
ford Daily."
Any worthy suggestions for im
| proving the situation will be ac
[ cepted by the Stanford governing
bodies, according to Dowell.
"I haven't lost faith in student
principles," he said, "and I believe
there are as many honest students
