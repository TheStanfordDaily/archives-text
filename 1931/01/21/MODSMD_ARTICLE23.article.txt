# National Parks Lecture Topic; Pictures Shown
## Slides, Movies Show Park's Famed Beauties 
### 
For three-quarters of an hour last
night, Laurence Kitchell transported
his audience from the Little Theatre
to the beauties and wonders of the
famous Glacier National Park with
a series of pictures, both still and
moving, that showed a perfection
and artistry seldom rivalled.
Kitchell gave an illustrated lec
ture with the wild life and the scen
ery of the snow-covered peaks and
deep valleys of a most inaccessible
region forming the central topic.
Pictures that kept the camera man
i in hiding for three days to secure,
! gave a sincere reproduction of that
most elusive creature, the Rocky
Mountain goat.
Among others were deer, bears,
and mountain sheep. A number of
famous personages among the
Blackfeet Indians were shown.
Kitchell spends every summer in
Glacier National Park, conducting
tours and taking pictures. In the
winter season, when he is unable to
remain in the high country, he re
turns to the cities of the Coast and
relates his experiences in the wilds.
