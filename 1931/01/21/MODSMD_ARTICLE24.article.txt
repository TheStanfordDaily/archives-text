# CULVER ADDRESSES MOTHERS MEETING ON DEAN'S DUTIES
## Describes Variety of Work Done by His Office 
### 
Examples of the wide variety of
problems that go through his office
were cited yesterday in a talk by
George B. Culver, Dean of Men, be
fore a meeting of the Stanford Moth
ers' Club in the Women's Clubhouse.
The address was preceded by re
ports of the secretary and treasurer,
the former stating that 50 new mem
bers had joined the club since the
last meeting, making a total roll of
950.
As the Dean's office has charge of
all men's dormitories, stated Culver
and as he is a public and semi-public
official and a member of several
committees dealing with students, he
has to cope with some surprising
situations. Disturbances in the halls,
complaints, housing problems, and
visits and letters from prospective
students are some of the matters that
come to his attention frequently.
Praises Sponsors
In speaking of his work with the
sponsors, Dean Culver commended
them warmly, calling them a group
of the outstanding men on the cam
pus, who hold a position of great re
sponsibility in connection with their
contact with the freshmen.
One example of his outside letters
mentioned by Culver was a request
from a man in Holland asking for
references about a Stanford man who
wished to marry his daughter. The
Dean was able to give satisfactory
information, and the couple is now
engaged.
