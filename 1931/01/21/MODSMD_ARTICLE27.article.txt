# SHORT, SPEEDY PASSING MARKS CAGE WORKOUT
## Bunn Strives To Perfect Rapid-Fire Attack For U.C.Tilt SPECTATORS BARRED 
### 
By Stewart Crawford
Continuing his efforts to perfect ;t
rapid-fire, short-passing, and quick
breaking offense, Coach Bunn direct
ed his Cardinal cagers yesterday aft
ernoon in a plan of attack calculated
to upset the Golden Bear Saturday
night through use of the game-win
ning "cripple" shot.
Behind the locked doors of the
Pavilion the Indian coach devoted
the full two hours of practice to run
ning his first string men against an
outfit of "Grays."' Long passes and
long shots, heretofore the chief scor
ing weapons of the Redshirts, were
noticeably absent.
Fawcctt Injured
Injured in Saturday night's melee
with the Trojans, Vance Fawcett was
favoring a wrenched left arm yes
terday, though it is expected that ho
will be in good shape for the Bear
tussle. "Dazzy ' paid little attention
to the hurt until it began to swell
noticeably Monday. lie spent most
of the practice session on the side
lilies, tossing baskets and otherwise
trying to limber-up the injured arm,
while Phil Baker worked in his place
against the Grays.
All of the squad showed the ef
fects of the U.S.C. scrap, especially
Captain Mike Reynolds, who is trou
bled with a charley-horse. Though
the condition of the men has un
doubtedly hampered progress for the
past two days, Bunn is confident
that his basketeers will be in shape
for the toughtest scrimmage of the
week, planned for today.
Tomorrow will see the Redshirts
in a lighter workout, while Friday
they will limit activities to tossing
buckets and otherwise handling the
ball to keep in basketball trim until
the opening whistle sounds in the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday night.
Bunn Sees Hope
Though comparative scores show
the Bears to be favorites by virtue of
their victories over both U.C.L.A.
and the Trojan five, Bunn said last,
night that chances for an upset were
not too rMm. "If we can take Price's
outfit Saturday night," he said, "I'd
be willing to bet that we'll take the
series from the Berkeley team."
It will be remembered that Cali
fornia downed each of the two
aforementioned quintets by the nar
row margin of two points, while the
Cardinals hold a seven point vic
tory over U.S.C., and caused the
Bruin fivo quite a little tiouble in
two skirmishes in the south.
