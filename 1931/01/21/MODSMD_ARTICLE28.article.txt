CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 20. (IP)
—The rift in Harvard-Princeton ath
letic relations which started in 192f»
seemed nearer a close today than
it has at any time in the intervening
four years.
Princeton undergraduate "officials"
and five Harvard sports captains
have agreed upon a policy of re
suming athletic relations between
the two colleges. Princeton favors
immediate resumption of relations
with Harvard in all sports excepl
football. Harvard favors immediate
resumption of relations "including
football if that were possible."
