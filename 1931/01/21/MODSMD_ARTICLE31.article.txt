# EXPEL CHEATERS?

### 
"Retention of the Honor Code with the modifying clause per
mitting students to demand a proctor if cheating occurs during an !
examination is the suggestion of Hetty Alden. president of the As- j
â€¢ * r
sociated Women Students, as a substitute for tlie compulsory honorj
r
system now in force.
i
The suggestion was made as a result of dissatisfaction with the i
present Honor Lode recently expressed by many members of the
student body. The proposal is not new. and is offered as a com- |
promise between honor and proctor systems. The Honor Code I
would be retained where class personnel warranted it, but it cheat-j
ing occurred during an examination any student, without revealing j
anv names, might petition the professor for a proctor.
In each instance the plan was rejected in favor of a complete
honor system.
In 15elgian universities, where cheating is extremely rare, ac
cording to Dr. J. I). H. Donnav, a graduate of the University of
Liege and now a member of the Stanford faculty, permanent ex
pulsion is the penalty for dishonesty in examinations. Not only is
the student ejected from his own college, but be is not permitted to
enter any other institution.
V great majority of Stanford men and women favor the're-j
tention of a complete honor system, if that system could be rigidly j
upheld. Violators of the Honor Code in Belgium are few. Vio-j
lators of the Honor Code at Stanford are many. It might prove-!
worthwhile for Stanford to adopt the Belgian enforcement pro-'
gram.
