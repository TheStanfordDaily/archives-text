# THEY ARE PAYING FOR IT

Regarding the proposal that the Stanford Student Health
Service be extended to include a 24-hour a day dispensary service,
it is said that funds now'available are inadequate to finance such a
project.
In this matter two possibilities suggest themselves: hirst, that
the I niversitv rebudget the Student I le.alth Service funds t<> secure
students the benefits of a 24-hour a day service; second, that the
I niversitv enlist the aid of the School of Medicine in providing
such a service.
The first of these proposals may be nothing more than a pos
sibilitv. I'erhrrps the student-contributed monies available to the
Health Service cannot be better spent than is now the case. Per
haps a limited office care during the daytime- is all that can be se
cured for the students. Hut it is also possible that these funds may
be rebudgeted so as to provide students with a complete dispensary
service, without materially affecting the worthwhile phases of the
program now being carried out.
Five dollars is a lot of money for a student to pay
every three months for medical care, and it is to his in
terest that that care be something more than a service
whose functions are primarily "advisory and educational."
The second proposal seems feasible. Stanford operates a great
medical school on the campus and in San Francisco. Why not work
out with this division of the I "niversitv plans for the organizing of
a 24-hour a day campus medical service? \\ by not have a student
infirmary, with resident physicians at night, incorporated into the
new I'alo Alto Hospital when completed? And why not have in
ternes from the medical school for this work.-'
So once again comes the old, old question, why not give a $5
service for ass fee? Why not provide the students with medical
care during every hour of the 24? They are paying for it.
