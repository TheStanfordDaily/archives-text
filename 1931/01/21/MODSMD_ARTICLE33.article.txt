The scientific mind has a passion for classification. Whatever
else they did or did not do, the earliest workers in most fields of
scientific investigation classified their subject matter. -Tn fact, science
in its beginnings consisting chiefly of classification. Perhaps this
accounts for the efforts of modern educators, themselves desirous
of having education considered a science, to classify each and every
one of their undergraduate charges definitely, finally and unques
tionably.
In our times, when a pupil enters the kindergarten he is classi
fied almost before his hat has been set'upon its peg. Ile is classified
according to age, sex, nationality, race, social status, intelligence—
in fact, according to every trait which the ingenious and tireless
classifiers can conceive.
Their classifications are very precise and scientific. Intelligence
is computed to two decimal places, age to the day, social status to
the dollar. After being completely classified, the neophyte enters
that great classifying machine, commonly known as Education.
After eight, twelve, sixteen or more years of classification he is
given a certificate or diploma which certifies that lie has reached a
certain stage in the machine. Isn't it wonderful?—The Minnesota
