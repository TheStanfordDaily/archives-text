"PAID"—At the Varsity Theatre.
Even if you don't like Joan
Crawford, this is a good picture. But
if you don't, we diagnose optical
trouble. She manages to look about
as well as anyone on the screen, and
even with the handicap of her new
title, "The Empress of Emotion,"
she turns out another good per
formance in "Paid," and is given an
excellent story and supporting cast,
including Robert Armstrong, Marie
Prevost, and John Miljan.
The plot is one of revenge,
crooked dealings made lawful, and
police battling against the clever
ness of a young woman, taken from
Bayard Veiller's "Within the Law."
Compared with "Lightnin'," this is
much better, we should say.

THE LIMESTONE TREE—By Jo
<g;ph. Hergesheimer. NCw York.
19.11. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
In* "The Limestone Tree," Joseph
Hergesheimer's latest romance, one
finds the same stately prose and the
same Southern setting that have
characterized many of the „ writer's
earlier volumes. This time Herge
sheimer traces with his exquisitely
fine pen the career of a Kentucky
family which pioneered, late n\ the
Eighteenth century, in the limestone
and - bluegrass region of the Ken
tucky river, and which found the
land so much to its liking that it
took root and grew there always, a
venerable tree of the limestone.
That limestone and the bluegrass

were in the blood of the Sashes and
Abels, who formed the family of
which Hergesheimer narrates. For
more than a hundred years they
lived and loved and fought and died i
there, and as the Nineteenth cen
tury drifted into the Twentieth, their ,
latest desecendant found the allure
ment of the country so overpowering i
that he returned from the sophisti- |
cation of Paris to the simple home 1
of his forefathers.
Those readers who enjoyed "Balis
and" and other similar works by j
the same author, cannot fail to be
pleased by "The Limestone Tree." ]
AMBUSH—By Herbert Read. The I
Criterion Miscellany. Faber &
Faber, Ltd. London. 1930. (At the
Stanford Bookstore.)
This small volume contains a few
short impressionistic sketches of the
World War. The writer creates a
poor impression in the first para- I
graph when he exclaims, "Oh such
a mess!" but most of his writing is
above this level.
His stories might have created |
something of a sensation a few years j
ago; but, after the piling up of hor- j
rors in war books written during
the past few years, one is not par- '
ticulorly interested in Mr. Read's
unpleasant pictures.
The style, which is something of
an effort to imply stream of con
sciousness narration, has been over
dene by modernist writers. An un
usual thing which has already be
come trite is unbearable.
