There may be nothing in it, be
cause the house in question prides
itself on being very exclusive, but
they started breaking ground for an
annex there, yesterday. "We would
n't take anyone, of course, who
wasn't truly Xi Xi Xi material," the
sisters affirm, so we guess that there
is a plethora of Xi Xi Xi material
this year.
"Popularity" with fraternity men
shows in a disagreeable light, this
week. Don't have your head turned
too far, little frosh-girl, if the best
looking Phi Beta Sigma on the cam
pus takes you on a long ride so that
he may talk to you. All sororities
have them on their pay-rolls, about
this time of year. (Ask X
X 's about their nugget that
almost slipped away, last rushing
season.)
Betty Co-ed, the blonde
charmer responsible for the
article on Stanford date rating
in yesterday's Daily, would
probably classify these gentle
men goddesses:
Fraternity man with appealing
eyes and soothing voice—s points.

Fraternity man with eyes,
voice, words to use it with, and
a Chrysler roadster (with or
without side curtains) — 50
points.
Fraternity man with eyes, voice,
line, Packard, and knowledge of the
best places to get flat tires, stalled
engines, etc.—soo points.
Fearless MAN with knock
down, drag-out tactics, who
never takes "no" for an answer
—anything up to seven figures.
Name your own ....
Stalled engines and muddy l'oads
reminds us of the fraternity senior
who carted a load of be-tortured
initiates far out in the hills, intend
ing to make them find their way
home on foot. Only the road was
muddy, the car mired down in the
mud, and the senior walked home
with Ihe rest of the sufferers.
For two hours we stood valiantly
by our guns, yesterday, and with
stood the repeated charges of the
Chaparral sales brigade. When they
came to close quarters, however, we
had to capitulate. (Close quarters—
get it?)
