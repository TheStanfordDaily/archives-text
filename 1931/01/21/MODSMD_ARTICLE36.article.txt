# LOOKING AROUND

### Abe Mellinkoff 
The co-cd's endorsement in yes
terday's "Campus Opinion" of our
statement favoring rough clothing
for college men is welcome. We have
been called many other things than
cur own name by irate women over
the policy of this column.
Not only do dirty cords sym
bolize the rough's contempt for
most feminine desire but, on
the "q.t.," they cut the cleaning
hiil tremendously and that ac
counts for their great popular
ity with men.
The 500 derive great glee and ego
maximation from complaining about
the lockout rules despite the fact
that .most of them never stayed out
later than one o'clock before com
ing to the Farm.
Everything is relative and the
co-eds who complain should
consider the regulation at the
University of Omaha, "Students
under 18 are locked up if found
in the streets after !) o'clock in
the evening.''
If such a rule were adopted at
Stanford, a great number of co-eds
would have to leave the library be
fore closing time.
And another thing some would
like to know is whether being found
in a rumble seat is technically "in
the street," and would be considered
an infraction of the Omaha law.
Norman Thomas, Socialist candi
date for the presidency in H)2B,
speaking at Johns Hopkins, claims
that 90 per cent of college students
are not discharging their debt to
society.
People seem to feel that he
cause students open a few hooks
in philosophy and political sci
ence, that they should forthwith
grab a cross and march off to
save mankind from some evil.
Students, afler studying martyrs
of the past, realize that to join the
swing is much more conducive to

1 happiness .than trying to save the
public from evils they don't mind
suffering.
The height of something or other
was the University of Minnesota
| student who flunked a course in
| "Plow to Study."
That's almost as bad as memoriz
ing myriads of isolated facts for a
course that claims the purpose of
i college education is to train students
1 to think*.

The University of Nebraska will
, give classes in home economics for
1 men. With the continual advance in
1 woman's freedom, it is becoming
; more and more necessary that men
[ take a hand in the home.
Once men only bad to bring
home the bacon; now they must
fry it. serve it, and wash the
frying pan.
