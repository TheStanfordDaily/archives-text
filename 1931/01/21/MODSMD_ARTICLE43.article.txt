BALLADE OF WHAT'S TIIE USE
My feelings are sham, and my heart
is a stone,
My pity is rusty with years of )
neglect;
Not one honest heart-throb can I
call my own,
And all noble thoughts from my
mind I eject.
I may put a front up that's good, j
and elect
To seem sympathetic and kind—
even whine
, A well-chosen phrase that is sweet
an<j select:
But don't you believe it; it's only 1
my '"line."
Were I, broken-hearted, deserted,
alone,
With all of my hopes and my
happiness wrecked,
To weaken, beginning to whimper
and moan,
Be sure, I'd be doing it just for
effect.
For whether I'm pleading for love
or respect,
Or merely for sympathy, how
ever fine
; My diction may be, or how clear

and direct,
You mustn't believe it; it's only
my "line."
i My thoughts are broadcast like a
bugle blast blown,
My soul is laid bare for the world
to inspect;
This hypocrite nature you cannot
condone,
The sneer of the skeptic is more
than correct.
For others, though deeply with
flaws they be flecked,
At least have a nature that's
true; not so mine,
I And though I may promise to
"cherish, protect,"
Don't ever believe it; it's only
my "line."
L'Envoi
I Sweet love, if I shamelessly dare to
affect
A love that is passionate, tender,
divine, '
| Just take it "cum grano"—■DO be
circumspect!
Why SHOULD you believe it?
It's only my "line."
