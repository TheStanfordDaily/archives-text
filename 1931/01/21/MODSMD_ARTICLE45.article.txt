IT CAN BE DONE
Stanford can beat California Sat
urday night in the first of a three
game basketball series. Stanford can
win from the Bears on the basket
ball floor for the first time in many,
many years. That is our opinion,
and we'll stick by it although we
are going on to qualify that state
ment.
In the first place, Stanford has
a passable hoop organization.
While not the most wonderful
basketball aggregation in the
world, the Indian starting five
can nevertheless turn in its
share of baskets, besides keep
ing the forwards of opposing
teams bottled up under the Red
sbirt hoop.
In the second place, California
has not the moat wonderful basket
ball team in the world, either. The
Bears can 'be beaten, and beaten
fairly decisively. They have good
guards, a tall center who can be
troublesome, and no better than
average forwards. Such is the or
ganization of the Blue and Gold.
And in the third place—Stan
ford has not yet shown the best
game that the present team is
capable of. Strangely enough,
we think the Indians' smoothest
work to date was against San
Francisco University. Certainly
the locals did not travel at full
speed for (lie entire duration of
the second Trojan tussle.
But, as ever, there is a large-sized
musca domestica in the salve. One
never knows when a basketball
team will be a basketball team or
just five young men trying hard to
get along together—or whether some
unsuspected personage will blossom
out suddenly as a perfect marksman.
In fact, more than one en
gagement between cagers has
been won by the unerring aim
<tf some obscure person who
leaps into the headlines on his
good night, only to retire to
oblivion when his luck has
turned. Such is the peculiarity
of the game, which finds a man
a wizard one night and a dub
the next.
Aside from the fact that shooting
may have something to do with the
final outcome of hoop set-to's, team
play also enters into the picture.
Strange as it seems, a team may
look like a steamroller on o;ie eve
ning, and then on the following
night resemble very closely the
mechanics of a 1915 Ford with a
bearing or two burned out.
So it simmers down to this:
1. —If Stanford can play a good
game of basketball; 2. —If Cali
fornia does not sink too many
lucky shots; and .'5. —If the team
functions as an organization and
not like live strange dogs—then
we unhesitatingly predict that
the Indians will win a ball game.

ning, and then on the following
night resemble very closely the
mechanics of a 1915 Ford with a
bearing or two burned out.
So it simmers down to this:
1. —If Stanford can play a good
game of basketball; 2. —If Cali
fornia does not sink too many
lucky shots; and .'5. —If the team
functions as an organization and
not like live strange dogs—then
we unhesitatingly predict that
the Indians will win a ball game.

IT CAN BE DONE
Stanford can beat California Sat
urday night in the first of a three
game basketball series. Stanford can
win from the Bears on the basket
ball floor for the first time in many,
many years. That is our opinion,
and we'll stick by it although we
are going on to qualify that state
ment.
In the first place, Stanford has
a passable hoop organization.
While not the most wonderful
basketball aggregation in the
world, the Indian starting five
can nevertheless turn in its
share of baskets, besides keep
ing the forwards of opposing
teams bottled up under the Red
sbirt hoop.
In the second place, California
has not the moat wonderful basket
ball team in the world, either. The
Bears can 'be beaten, and beaten
fairly decisively. They have good
guards, a tall center who can be
troublesome, and no better than
average forwards. Such is the or
ganization of the Blue and Gold.
And in the third place—Stan
ford has not yet shown the best
game that the present team is
capable of. Strangely enough,
we think the Indians' smoothest
work to date was against San
Francisco University. Certainly
the locals did not travel at full
speed for (lie entire duration of
the second Trojan tussle.
But, as ever, there is a large-sized
musca domestica in the salve. One
never knows when a basketball
team will be a basketball team or
just five young men trying hard to
get along together—or whether some
unsuspected personage will blossom
out suddenly as a perfect marksman.
In fact, more than one en
gagement between cagers has
been won by the unerring aim
<tf some obscure person who
leaps into the headlines on his
good night, only to retire to
oblivion when his luck has
turned. Such is the peculiarity
of the game, which finds a man
a wizard one night and a dub
the next.
Aside from the fact that shooting
may have something to do with the
final outcome of hoop set-to's, team
play also enters into the picture.
Strange as it seems, a team may
look like a steamroller on o;ie eve
ning, and then on the following
night resemble very closely the
mechanics of a 1915 Ford with a
bearing or two burned out.
So it simmers down to this:
1. —If Stanford can play a good
