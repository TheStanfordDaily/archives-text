# Bunn Drills Papoose Quintet On Fundamentals
## FOUL CONVERSION SHOTS STRESSED IN BARE PRACTICE Sessions Closed To Public As Indian Frosh Five Is Overhauled 
### Francis Hamilton 
Coach John Bunn's frosh cage
artists were put through a stiff drill
ing in the fundamentals of the game
during yesterday's practice session.
Particular consideration was given
to the gentle art of carressing the
inside of the net with the tricky
leather sphere. Most of the evening's
time was taken up with work on
free throws, followed by floor shoot
ing from all angles.
Practice Closed
An innovation was the secret
practice. A recent feature of varsity
workouts, Bunn has introduced it
on the frosh squad only this week
when he began the rebuilding of
the babes for the coming California
game Saturday night in Oakland.
Coach Bunn remains assured that
only a complete overhauling of the
first-year team will give them a
fighting chance to bring home a vic
tory from the Bear encounter. Drill
that is strenuous in the full sense of
the word has been scheduled for
the Indian babes. Stress will be
given to the fundamentals of shoot
ing, passing, dribbling, and until
these essentials are mastered the
frosh cannot hope to present fin
ished teamwork on the floor.
Jenkins in Lineup
Jenkins, a large-framed, pugna
cious back guard, is working out
again after an absence since the first
of the quarter. Bunn plans to give
him a chance in Saturday night's
fray. Need of a large man who can
mix it up in this position has been
felt all season, and it may be that
the presence of Jenkins in the lineup
will bolster the chances of the frosh
considerably.
From all reports, the California
yearlings are playing up to par
basketball this season, and if the
Cards a>-e to enter the tangle with
anywhere near favorable odds, they
must expect to display a renovated
outfit that plays better ball than
last week's games pi'oduced.
