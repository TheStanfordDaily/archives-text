# Chappie Scores Administration's L.D. Restriction
## Administration Would Cut Into Own Income 
### 
In its current number Chaparral
> voices its stand against the admin
istration's policy of lower division
I restriction.
| The administration, Chaparral
i points out, has seen fit to call upon
the Board of Athletic Control's
funds, derived mainly from football
receipts, for the construction of pro
i jects the money for which ordinar
ily should be supplied by the Uni
versity itself. With the elimination
of the possibility of developing a
! strong eleven the administration
would thus be curtailing its "own"
income.
Chaparral declared: "The BA.C.
I built Branner . . . supported the
band . . . laid out a fine golf course
. . . constructed one of the finest
college athletic plants anywhere . . .
the administration not satisfied . . .
checking the life-blood of success
ful Stanford sports . . . barring
young men with speed and strength
and skill and yet supporting half a
dozen administration projects with
gate receipts . . ."
