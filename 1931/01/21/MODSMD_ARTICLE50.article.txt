# GYMNASTS ARRANGE REGULAR WORKOUTS FOR COMING SEASON
## 
### 
With regular team workouts now
in progress the local gymnastic art
ists are now preparing for the sea
son's activities.
Last year's main collegiate compe
tition for the flying rings and hori
zontal bar acrobats was the annual
meet with the California varsity at
Berkeley.
Last season's meet was won by
the Bears by a score of 35 to 19.
However, the Indian yearlings
turned the tables on the Berkeley
frosh by a score of 52 to 46.
The win of the local freshmen
means that several good men from
that squad are now working out on
the varsity and should do much to
strengthen the team. With a strong
varsity this year prospects for de
feating California look somewhat
brighter.
Professor Royce Reed Long of the
School of Physical Education and
Hygiene is in charge of the team
and serving as coach.
Competition with California in
varsity and freshman gymnastics
will probably take place early in
March, with several preliminary
contests with other schools pre
ceding it.
