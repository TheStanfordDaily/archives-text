# FROSH TRACK PROSPECTS LOOK GOOD IN HURDLES,MILE, WEIGHTS, SPRINTS
## 
### Francis Lloyd 
According to present indications, j
! the strength of the Indian babe
j tracksters for this year will be con
j centrated about the weights, hurdle,
1 mile, and sprint events. Candidates
i for the one-lap and two-lap events
| must be developed, however, if the
j Class of '34 expects to have a suc
i ce:;sful track season.
j Lyman, who hung up a new rec- |
i ord in the intramurals this fall for
: the shot put, may be expected to '
! gather in many points for Ellington's |
: boys before the final man bi'eaks |
I the tape in the Little Big Meet,
j Kantzner will be able to help out :
: Lyman in the discus event, which :
| should assure the freshmen of sev
; eral more digits in the "business" :
! column.
Hurdlers Look Good
The hurdling prospects seem fairly
I bright, with Miers and Edmonds, !
j the youngest brother of the late '
j Ward Edmonds, taking over the as- j
| signments. Miers has had a very fine J
i prep school record in the hurdling '
events, where he showed consistency j
j and form. Edmonds is more of a I
| "dark horse," but with ordinary de- •
j velopment and good coaching may j
prove to be a winner.
The first-year men have appar- j

j ently a real star for the mile run in
Azevedo. In high school, this four
lap jaunter came very close to 4:30.
Early reports this season seemed to
point to the fact that Azevedo was
running true to form, with a rea
sonable improvement expected.
Birch seems to be the most promis
t ing man in the two-lap event.
Willson Is Sprint Star
Jimmie Willson, former San Diego
i high school flash, is being counted
! on to take care of the 100-yard dash
J for the freshmen. Jimmie has been
running close to event time so far
i in practice and should get under 10
i seconds by the time regular compe
-1 tition starts.
It is too early in the season to
predict which one of the many
candidates for the 440, high jump,
broad jump, pole vault, and javelin
I will get the call. Edmonds - may
; prove to be capable of taking over
] the pole vault, while Miers may
; compete in the high jump. However,
both of these men have hurdling
S assignments and may concentrate
! on them.

Birch seems to be the most promis
t ing man in the two-lap event.
Willson Is Sprint Star
Jimmie Willson, former San Diego
i high school flash, is being counted
! on to take care of the 100-yard dash
J for the freshmen. Jimmie has been
running close to event time so far
i in practice and should get under 10
i seconds by the time regular compe
-1 tition starts.
It is too early in the season to
predict which one of the many
candidates for the 440, high jump,
broad jump, pole vault, and javelin
I will get the call. Edmonds - may
; prove to be capable of taking over
] the pole vault, while Miers may
; compete in the high jump. However,
both of these men have hurdling
S assignments and may concentrate
! on them.
According to present indications, j
! the strength of the Indian babe
j tracksters for this year will be con
j centrated about the weights, hurdle,
1 mile, and sprint events. Candidates
i for the one-lap and two-lap events
| must be developed, however, if the
j Class of '34 expects to have a suc
i ce:;sful track season.
j Lyman, who hung up a new rec- |
i ord in the intramurals this fall for
: the shot put, may be expected to '
! gather in many points for Ellington's |
: boys before the final man bi'eaks |
I the tape in the Little Big Meet,
j Kantzner will be able to help out :
: Lyman in the discus event, which :
| should assure the freshmen of sev
; eral more digits in the "business" :
! column.
Hurdlers Look Good
The hurdling prospects seem fairly
I bright, with Miers and Edmonds, !
j the youngest brother of the late '
j Ward Edmonds, taking over the as- j
| signments. Miers has had a very fine J
i prep school record in the hurdling '
events, where he showed consistency j
j and form. Edmonds is more of a I
| "dark horse," but with ordinary de- •
j velopment and good coaching may j
prove to be a winner.
The first-year men have appar- j

j ently a real star for the mile run in
Azevedo. In high school, this four
lap jaunter came very close to 4:30.
Early reports this season seemed to
point to the fact that Azevedo was
running true to form, with a rea
sonable improvement expected.
