# GLEDHILL AND COUGHLIN WIN COURT TITLE
## Champions Down Weesner, Easton, 8-6, 8-6, In Doubles Finals 
### 
After two bitterly contested sets,
which went to 8-G, 8-G, Keith Gled
hi 11 and Joe Coughlin yesterday
walked off the tennis courts in pos
session of a hard-earned University
doubles championship at the ex
pense of Ted Easton and Chuck
Weesner.
Anybody's match until the final
point, the Easton-Weesner combina
tion came so near victory in the
first set, and twice again in the sec
ond, that all the power on the other
side of the net was called into play
to stop their upward sweep.
Hard First Set
Starting out with a bang, Easton
and Weesner took every point in
the first game, but Gledhill retali
ated by serving a love game to tie
the score; and taking the next two
without much trouble. But from
then on the battle was nip and tuck,
until in the twelfth game, with the
score at G-5 in their favor, Easton
and Weesner palled up to point-set,
only to bo stubbornly held and
forced to drop the next two games.
In the second set, after quickly
taking the first two games, Gledhill
and Coughlin found themselves up
against a determined pair of net
men, who, in the course of the next
few games, passed their rivals, held
their lead, and threatened twice in
the twelfth game to cop the set.
Both limes, however, the Gledhill-
Coughlin team rose to the occasion
and prevented the winning point.
By easily turning the next two
games their way, they cinched the
match and the coveted title of Uni
versity doubles champions.
