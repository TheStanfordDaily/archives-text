# NEW MINER'S LAMP AIDS GAS DETECTION
## 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 20. (/P.)â€”
Hailed as 15 times as efficient as
the ordinary miner's safety lamp, a
new type gas detector for use in
coal mines was announced here to
day by the United States Bureau of
Mines and the State Industrial Com
mission.
It was developed at an estimated
cost of $240,000, largely in the mines
of Utah, with the co-operation of
operators. With it methane gas, a
high explosive found in coal mines,
can be detected in quantities as low
as one tenth of one per cent, its
sponsors declare.
