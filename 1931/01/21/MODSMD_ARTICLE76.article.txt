## 
### 
DELVIDERE, 111., Jan. 20. </P)
â€”The local "mint" has been
closed, temporarily at least.
The "mint" in this particular
case happens to be Albert W.
Bcnliam, who has picked up a
lot of nicknames lately, includ
ing "Midas," "The One-Man
Mint," and "Big-Money Al" be
cause be has gained the reputa
tion of paying from 20 to 50
per cent to investors.
Yesterday was pay day. Al
paid off as usual, but refused
to accept any more money for
investment, even rejecting old
customers.
"To tell the truth,"he said,
"I'm getting just a bit nervous.
It isn't because the grand jury
is scheduled to investigate me
next week. My business is on
the level and the grand jury
will be just a bunch of my
friends. But I'm getting nervous
at the way the papers have
been making a national figure
of me. Look at that stack of
letters!"
