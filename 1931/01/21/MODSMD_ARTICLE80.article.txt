## 
### 
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 20. (/P)â€”Cap
tain Robert Dollar, 86-year-old head
of the Dollar Steamship Lines, was
resting comfortably at his home here
today after a minor operation for a
bladder ailment yesterday.
In addition to the bladder ailment
Captain Dollar was suffering a
slight attack of bronchitis. Dr. Ra
fael G. Dufficy, attending physician,
said the operation relieved the con
dition as expected but that weak
ness due to the patient's advanced
age made it necessary to watch him
closely.
