## University Favors Central Living Quarters For Fraternities 
### 
Group housing and a uniform
I system of fraternity accounting were
. the paramount problems discussed
and unofficially approved at an open
forum meeting of the Interfraternity
! Board of Control and house presi
: dents at the home of Dr. Robert E.
! Swain, acting-president of the Uni
versity, last night.
Dr. Swain again outlined the Uni
versity's objectives on its. group
housing plan. They are: first, that
all men, fraternity and non-frater
nity, be grouped in a central area;
j second, that all buildings be of per
-1 manent construction; and third, that
,it be an endowed project calling
for ultimate University ownership of
all fraternity homes.
Plans Outlined
Several group housing plans were
i discussed, most of which contem
plated individual fraternity units
built together into a large structure,
j with separate dining rooms and a
common kitchen and social hall.
| Each group would have its own
j chapter living rooms, with one large
i hall to serve all the fraternities for
dances and similar functions.
Two points suggested as being (he
chief obstacles to immediate realiza
tion of the plan were existing pre
judice against group housing and
the problem of finance.
Duke System Approved
The Duke University plan of
1 group housing was informally ex
| amined and given the approval of
the majority of the persons present.
Several suggestions aiming toward
the establishment of a uniform sys
tem of accounting for Stanford fra
ternities were presented and dis
j cussed at length.
j Fraternity pi'esidents were in
structed to carry the discussion of
these two questions to their respec
' tive houses. Next week the Interfra
-1 ternity Board of Control will meet
I to consider more definite action in
both matters.
