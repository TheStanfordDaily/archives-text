# CLARK DECISION ON PROHIBITION WILL BE TRIED
## Question On Ratification Of Amendment By States To Be Judged HUGHES DISQUALIFIED 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. (/P)â€”'The
life of constitutional prohibition was
in the keeping of the Supreme Court
tonight.
Within a few weeks it is to hand
down a ruling sustaining or invali
dating the Eighteenth Amendment.
Today it listened intently to argu
ments supporting and attacking the
recent decision of Federal Judge
William Clark of New Jersey hold
ing the amendment was improperly
ratified because submitted to the
state legislatures rather than popu
lar vote conventions.
Court Room Crowded
For the Government, Solicitor
General Thacher contended the
Court had already settled the issues
presented in favor of the validity
of the amendment, and that it was
within the discretion of Congress to
choose the mode of ratification.
Supporting the Clark decision,
Julius Henry Cohen and Selden
Bacon, New York attorneys, main
tained it was mandatory that a
proposed constitutional amendment
subjecting individual rights to fed
eral control be ratified by state con
ventions.
The small court room was crowded
with spectators. Many members of
Congress were present. A long line
waited outside the door seeking ad
mittance.
Hughes Retires
Only once throughout the entire
argument did a member of the Court
interrupt to ask a question. It is
customary for the Judges to question
counsel freely.
At the outset of the session, Chief
Justice Hughes withdrew from the
case. Ho said he had submitted a
brief when prohibition was before
the Court a decade ago and felt this
disqualified him.
Thacher's argument was based
upon a contention that Article V
of the Constitution clearly had given
Congress authority to determine the
manner in which amendments
should be ratified, whether by legis
lature or convention.
Decision Reached Before
He insisted the Court by repeated
decisions, especially in the national
prohibition cases of 1920, had al
ready decided the discretion of Con
gress in this particular could not be
limited or abridged by interpreta
tions of the intentions of the au
thors of the Constitution.
Cohen and Bacon argued the lib
erties of the people were at stake
and that if legislatures could legally
abrogate their constitutional rights,
then the government would degen- j
crate into a despotic oligarchy.
Early Judges Quoted
They made frequent references
to the opinions of John Marshall,
famed chief justice of the early
days of the Republic, and to the |
writings of James Madison who had
an important share in framing the
Constitution.
The one question asked by the J
Court came from Associate Justice
Sutherland. He inquired of Bacon
whether it was contended the Eight- <
centh Amendment to be valid must
be submitted to the direct vote of s
the people.
Bacon's reply was it should have
been submitted to state conventions.
When the Constitution was written,
he said, the people were not think
ing of referenda.
