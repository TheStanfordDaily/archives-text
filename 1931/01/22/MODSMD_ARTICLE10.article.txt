## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (/t*). â€”
William C. Redfield, former Secre
tary of Commerce, speaking before
the Cause and Cure of War Confer
ence today, said the Hawaiian, Fili
pino and Porto Rican had not been
assimilated into the United States'
peculation.
With all his heart, he said, he
wished America could devise some
solution of the Philippine question,
but he advocated the obligation of
strength.
Yusuke Tsurmi, Japanese political
analyst, asserted Japan's attitude to
ward preparedness was "dictated" by
the fact she had to keep the sea
route to Korea free from attack and
her straits open for navigation.
