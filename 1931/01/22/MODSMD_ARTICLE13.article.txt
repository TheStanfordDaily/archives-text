## Foes Claim Intervention Of President In Findings Of Commission 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. (/P)—The
Wickersham report with its varying
conclusions for revision, repeal, and
retention of the 18th Amendment
churned up additional controversy
today and brought forth a resolution
I to inquire if the commission had
| been unduly influenced into chang
ing its opinion at the last minute.
Senator Tydings, of Maryland, a
Democratic anti-prohibitionist, in
troduced a measure calling for a
Senate inquiry to determine how
the commission arrived at its "con
flicting conclusions" and whether
| advice was received from outside.
Intervention Denied
Reports that the President had
intervened brought a thirty-word
statement of denial from Chairman
Wickersham. Immediately afterward,
he locked his doors to newspaper
men.
Late in the day, however, a two
paragraph statement was issued at
the offices of the commission calling
"wholly without foundation" state
ments that the President had caused
the commission at the last moment
to abandon some of its recommenda
j tions.
"At no time has the President in
any manner attempted to influence
the recommendations of this com
mission," it said.
Statement "False"
The statement said suggestions
that the report had been changed
after it was signed were "wholly
tVlse."
At the White House, it was said
j there would be no statement on the
I matter, either of denial or of affirm
ation.
The combined commission report,
signed by ten of the eleven mem
bers, set forth a draft of a sug
! gested revision of the amendment
j Wfth an "if"' in front of it and a
| statement that the members were
I divided in opinion.
Six of the eleven, however, said
i in their appended statements that
they favored either revision or re
peal and at least two referred to
revision as if the full commission
was understood by them to ap
| prove of it.
i A silence as baffling as that which
j hid the long deliberations of the
| commission shut out any peep into
| the manner by which the conclu
i sions were drawn up.

In Richmond, Henry W. Anderson,
I who presented a proposed substi
i tute for the present system of pro
! hibition, said the report as a whole
! "favors modification of the 18th
