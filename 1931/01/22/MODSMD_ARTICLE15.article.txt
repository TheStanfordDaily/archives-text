# Race Discrimination Seen During Conference Meet
## 
### 
A concretc example of the dis
crimination against Negroes in the
United States was very forcefully
presented to delegates of the Stu
dcnt-Faculty Conference held in
Detroit Ihe last of December, ac
cording to Mrs. Ben Allen, Y.W.C.A.
secretary, who has just returned
from the East.
The conference was attended by
both white and Negro representa
tives from universities and colleges
all over the United States, including
college presidents, deans, faculty
members, and students. It was spon
sored by the Council of Christian
Associations.
Though the management of the
hotel where the convention was held
had promised to accord equal rights

i to the colored delegates, they closed
i certain rooms to them entirely. But
j the white delegates agreed to accept
| the same conditions, standing by
j their fellow-representatives.
However, the majority of the j
! Negroes left the conference. Also a
number of white delegates who
wished to be consistent in their co
operation with the Negroes with
drew.
"The result of this unfortunate
occurrence at Detroit has led to the
setting up of a commission composed
of students and faculty frorp North
ern and Southern universities for
the study of interracial questions as
a joint problem."
Reginald Gooden, a senior rcgis
' tered from Los Angeles, was also at
! the conference.
