# SIG CHI WINS MURAL HOOP GAME, 35-10
## Delta Chi No Match For Sigma Chi; Phi Kaps Win By Forfeit 
### 
By Michaci Crofoot
! Sequoia I is going to have no
i parade to this year's intramural
basketball championship.
Swamping Delta Chi's quintet,
j 35-10, Sigma Chi, 1930 champions,
served notice last night in the En
! cina gymnasium that they would be
very much in the running for the
I 1931 title.
Showing a clever passing attack,
Sigma Chi gained an early lead
i over Delta Chi on buckets by Gold
-1 water and Elliot and built this up
ito a 17-5 total at half time. They
i spurted at the beginning of the sec
ond period, running up 15 points
j before their opponents tallied again,
1 and then put in their second string
| and coasted home.
Fine Teamwork Seen
Like the all-star Sequoia team,
1 the impressive part of their showing
was their consistent, clever team
| work. This was the result of brilliant
j individual passing and floorwork.
They did very little dribbling.
Outstanding for the Sigma Chi
team were Joujon-Roche, Elliot, and
Bob Goldwater. Roche was the main
cog in his team's passing attack
which repeatedly worked the ball
in close to the Delta Chi goal. His
passing was accurate, swift, decep
tive, reminiscent of Vance Fawcett's.
Elliot, tall center, veteran of three
I intramural tournaments, aided and
| abetted this attack in admirable
fashion besides tossing in four buck
ets.
High-point honors of the evening
! went to Bob Goldwater, who looped
in 9 buckets and 2 fouls for a grand
: tctal of 20 points. Although his
; teammates were feeding him, his
! floorwork and fine eye for the buck
et were mainly responsible for this
I scoring spree.
El Cuadro Forfeits
Phi Kappa Sigma, scheduled to
I meet El Cuadro in the other game
j of the evening, got credit for their
second victory by the forfeit route.
Tonight's games match Delta Kap
pa Epsilon against Theta Delta Chi
! in the gym at 7 o'clock and Alpha
; Delta Phi against Sigma Nu in the
j gym at 8 o'clock.
Because the varsity and freshman
hoopmen will be occupying the
! Pavilion all afternoon and evening,
I the games scheduled there are to be
' postponed and played at the com
j peting teams' convenience. Alpha
! Kappa Lambda was to have met
Delta Upsilon and Kappa Alpha the
Vagabonds. Beta Theta Pi drew a
second-round bye.
