### 
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 21. (/l J t â€”A
decline of liquor drinking in Ameri
can colleges in the last five years
was reported at conferences of the
Council of Church Boards of Edu
cation preliminary to the meeting of
the American Association of Col
leges here tomorrow.
The only "prohibition problem" in
the colleges, said Dr. W. C. Covert,
Philadelphia, general secretary of
the Board of Christian Education of
tho Presbyterian Church in the
United States, is that of idle sons
from wealthy families, and student
drinking merely reflects the home
life and habits of the families.
