# Maestro Wins Plaudits Here With Concert
## Dobrowen's Conducting Is Symphony Feature; Audience Large 
### 
Featuring Issay Dobrowen, guest
conductor, the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra presented one of
the best programs of the season in
the Pavilion last night, which in
cluded Tschaikowsky's "Symphony
No. 5, in E minor," an interpretation
of the rise of the mass and the
triumph of a great p o p U ] ar cause,
the prelude, "The Afternoon .of a
Faun," by Debussy, and the Over
lure to "Meistersinger," by Wagner.
The conduction and program were
enthusiastically received by a large
audience.
Precisencss Keynote
Preciseness was the keynote of
Dobrowen's conducting, giving do
tailed attention to the interweaving
of the strings and the woodwinds in
the development of the theme.
Dobrowen's forte was the handling
of the softer tones in the second
and third movements of Tschaikow
sky's Fifth Symphony. The third
movement in particular was made a
beautiful piece of delicate tracery.
Closing Number Changed
The unity of the entire program
was unspoiled by the insertion of
encores inconsistent with the general
motif, which was selected with con
sideration for a more serious type
of music.
For his closing number, Dobrowen
substituted Wagner's "Meistersinger"
in place of the overture to "Tann
hauscr," by the same composer. The
change was received with great ac
claim by the audience.
