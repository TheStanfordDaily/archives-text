### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 21. (/P)
â€”Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of
the Interior, today sustained the ac
tion of Charles C. Moore, commis
sioner of the general land office, in
holding for rejection the application
of the Pioneer Kettleman Co., and
the Associated Oil Company of
California, for leases upon 1,336
acres of oil-bearing land near Coal
inga and Stratford, California.
Wilbur's decision also notified the
two companies to put into a more
compact acreage their minimum
royalty claims, now scattered
through a 1,336 acre total in 40-acre
blocks.
The decision was taken to mean
the application for leases must be
amended or the department will re
ject it.
