WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. (/P> —
Criticism of federal banks for their
policies toward farm land fore
closures was placed before the
House banking committee today as
it continued its study of measures
intended to grant additional drought
relief.
Representatives Blanton, of Texas,
and Hare of South Carolina, Demo
crats, expressed inability to see the
wisdom of Congressional action ap
proving expenditure of $150,000,000
for the Farm Board revolving fund
and $45,000,000 for loans, yet per
mitting federal farm loan and land
banks to "take the soil away from
the tillers."
Hare strongly urged consideration
of his bill which, among other things
would permit federal intermediate
credit banks to make loans to co
operative associations on products
up to 75 per cent of the value. An
other of his measures would forbid
farm loan banks to hold any fore
closed lands longer than five years
without approval of the Farm Loan
Board.
