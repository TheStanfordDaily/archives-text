# HURT ARM MAY SLOW FAWCETT IN U.C. TUSSLE
## Bunn Concerned As Indian Star Is Hampered In Cage Workouts INJURED IN TROY TILT 
### Stewart Crawford 
What, may prove a decided set
back to the prospects for a victory
on the basketball court from the
long triumphant Golden Bear was
indicated last night by Coach John
Bunn when he expressed some con
cern over the condition of "Dazzy"
Vance Fawcett's left arm, which was
injured in Saturday night's rough
encounter with the Trojan five.
Though there is little doubt that
Fawcett will start against the Bear.,
on Saturday night in the Oakland
Auditorium, the valuable guard has
nevertheless been favoring the in
jured arm to such an extent in prac
tice that it has caused the Indian
coach a little anxiety.
Can Work Little
Should the strained ligament fail
to limber up properly by Saturday,
the Indian chances to down the
Berkeley quintet, for five years un
realized, would bo decidedly les
sened. In its present condition, Faw
cett's arm has kept him out of the
harder scrimmages except for a few
minutes each day. While working
against the grays, he has been forced
to handle the ball with one hand.
Working in Fawcett's place at
guard this week, Phil Baker has
shown well, especially on offense.
Baker, though not up to the stand
ard of the incomparable Fawcett on
floor work, is adept at sinking his
setup shots. He is always depend
able, as his remarkably steady play
in the U.C.L.A. game down South
testified.
In Real Contest
For the first time this week, yes
terday's workout found the varsity
five in a real game against the
Grays. It was a hard, fast encounter,
resembling somewhat the rough
house Trojan encounters of last
week-end. Despite the fact that he
is not the tallest man on the team,
Captain Mike Reynolds proved that
he is the Cardinal's best bet to get
the tip-off from Read Saturday
night.
While the fioorwork of the varsity
five showed a decided improvement,
there was still evidence of a lack
of timing in passes. Coach Bunn
realizes that his men still play too
much of a waiting game, failing to
break fast and time passes correctly
to a man traveling at top speed!
Bunn Surprised
Stanford's new coach expressed
some surprise last night at having
found, after looking over the rec
ords, that the last basketball con
test that the Redskins have taken
from the Blue and Gold was way
back in 1925, under Coach Andy
Kerr.
Although, over the radio last
week, Bunn prophesied that Cali
fornia would win the title «of the
southern half of the Pacific Coast
Conference, he figures it by no
means impossible for his outfit to
upset the Bears.
"If the boys can only get out in
front at the start," he said, "so that
they can play their own game, the
final score might prove quite a sur
prise to the Berkeley institution."
And if Stanford comes out on top
in the first tilt Saturday night, Bunn
says that his basketeers arc a cinch
to win the series!

house Trojan encounters of last
week-end. Despite the fact that he
is not the tallest man on the team,
Captain Mike Reynolds proved that
he is the Cardinal's best bet to get
the tip-off from Read Saturday
night.
While the fioorwork of the varsity
five showed a decided improvement,
there was still evidence of a lack
of timing in passes. Coach Bunn
realizes that his men still play too
much of a waiting game, failing to
break fast and time passes correctly
to a man traveling at top speed!
Bunn Surprised
Stanford's new coach expressed
some surprise last night at having
found, after looking over the rec
ords, that the last basketball con
test that the Redskins have taken
from the Blue and Gold was way
back in 1925, under Coach Andy
Kerr.
Although, over the radio last
week, Bunn prophesied that Cali
fornia would win the title «of the
southern half of the Pacific Coast
Conference, he figures it by no
means impossible for his outfit to
upset the Bears.
"If the boys can only get out in
front at the start," he said, "so that
they can play their own game, the
final score might prove quite a sur
prise to the Berkeley institution."
And if Stanford comes out on top
in the first tilt Saturday night, Bunn
says that his basketeers arc a cinch
to win the series!
What, may prove a decided set
back to the prospects for a victory
on the basketball court from the
long triumphant Golden Bear was
indicated last night by Coach John
Bunn when he expressed some con
cern over the condition of "Dazzy"
Vance Fawcett's left arm, which was
injured in Saturday night's rough
encounter with the Trojan five.
Though there is little doubt that
Fawcett will start against the Bear.,
on Saturday night in the Oakland
Auditorium, the valuable guard has
nevertheless been favoring the in
jured arm to such an extent in prac
tice that it has caused the Indian
coach a little anxiety.
Can Work Little
Should the strained ligament fail
to limber up properly by Saturday,
the Indian chances to down the
Berkeley quintet, for five years un
realized, would bo decidedly les
sened. In its present condition, Faw
cett's arm has kept him out of the
harder scrimmages except for a few
minutes each day. While working
against the grays, he has been forced
to handle the ball with one hand.
Working in Fawcett's place at
guard this week, Phil Baker has
shown well, especially on offense.
Baker, though not up to the stand
ard of the incomparable Fawcett on
floor work, is adept at sinking his
setup shots. He is always depend
able, as his remarkably steady play
in the U.C.L.A. game down South
testified.
In Real Contest
For the first time this week, yes
terday's workout found the varsity
five in a real game against the
Grays. It was a hard, fast encounter,
resembling somewhat the rough
house Trojan encounters of last
