# TEE! HEE! I'VE A LETTER

### 
Safely tucked away in the present A.S.S.I', constitution are a
series of provisions regulating the awarding of block letters to
athletes upon completion of certain requirements in sports. The
latest ellort to bring about a revision of these requirements came
when the Kxemtive Committee consented to submit the proposed
changes to the student body for approval at the February elections.
it happens to be an old Spanish custom to change and revise the
requirements for letters. Kvery year some interested person begins
to feel sorry for the men who sit on the sidelines and endeavors to
find a suitable means to slip to them the block letter supposed to
indicate athletic merit.
The lJ.ui.v recommends the students vote to empower the Kx
( oimnittee to sell block letters for 50 cents each and let everyone
have one. Wouldn't that be just grand?
