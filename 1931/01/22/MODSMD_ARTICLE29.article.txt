braternity men can confidently expect that definite steps will
soon be taken to remedy the present unsatisfactory housing con-'
ditions.
I )r. I\. Swain, acting-president of the University, reiterated
the Administration's three-point fraternity housing objective, which
was published last week in the Daily, at a meeting of fraternal
leaders and University officials at his home Tuesday night, hollow
ing several hours of frank discussion, a majority of the < Ireek letter
men informally, but heartily approved the program.
.Multiple-unit grouping of fraternities is not a new idea. Many j
of the features of Toyon Mali were copied from fraternity unit
dwelling plans drawn up by the San brancisco I liter fraternity Con-1
ference about 10 years ago.
More recently Duke I'niversitv has successfully installed the.
"Stanford plan" of multiple-unit housing for Creek letter organiza- 1
tions. and the svstem is now endorsed without (|ualification by fra
ternitv and universitv leaders alike at the Xorth Carolina institu
.
Since the University, handicapped by a lack of funds, will be i
unable to finance any building program, the problem of finance at ;
once becomes serious and important. Another stumbling block in
the path to new houses is the existing prejudice on the part of cer- '
lain undergraduates and alumni against any multiple-unit housing
program.
Hut since such prejudice has generally been fostered by misin
formation, or a total lack of information, il may be that a clear!
statement of facts will wipe out this obstacle.
.Vow that undergraduate opinion apparently favors the plan, the
Interfraternilv Hoard of Control will meet next week to further
consider the problem. That body may be commended for its prompt
action.
