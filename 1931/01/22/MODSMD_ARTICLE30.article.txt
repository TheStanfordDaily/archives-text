< )hservauce of the I lonor < 'ode by every student appears much
more, likely now that members of the A.S.S.I', are taking a really
active interest in its enforcement, as evidenced by the adoption of
four specific recommendations by the F.xeeutive Committee at its,
Tuesday meeting.
The recommendations are:
1 ). That a policy be adopted by the faculty whereby any mem- \
bcr of a class may request, the instructor at any time, during or
before an examination, to place a proctor in charge of the examina
-1 ion.
2). That evcrv student be required to write a signed statement |
at the close, of his paper that he has not given or received aid dtir- I
ing the examination, and that no paper be corrected which has not
such a pledge on it.
). That the instructors shall direct the provisions and ideals of'
the Honor System to the attention of the classes before each ex
amination.
4). That placards or notices stating the principles of the system
be placed in all rooms before and during examinations.
Regardless of whether or not these recommendations are the |
wisest that could be made, the Executive Committee action is most j
encouraging, indicating as it does a healthy student interest in the ■
successful operation of the Honor Code.
