MODERN UNIVERSITIES. — By
Abrahum Flexner. Oxford Univer
sity Press. 1930. (At Stanford
Bookstore.)
| This volume is composed of lec
tures delivered by the author while
he was at Oxford under the auspices
j of the Rhodes Foundation. The ma
i terial gathered in a careful study
j of the problem has been presented
'in an interesting manner which,
however, savours occasionally of
that of the professional debunker.
I A great deal of well-deserved
criticism and ridicule is directed
; against Columbia, Chicago, and Wis
-1 consin universities in particular.
: Gems of absurdity far too numerous
for quotation ax*e cited from the
publications and advertisements of
these institutions, including a choice
, display of "patent medicine testi
monials" for Columbia correspond
ence courses. The folly of the inclu
j sion in university curricula of busi
ness and journalistic courses is
! noted.
The author suggests no panaceas.
1 He seems to think that there are
opportunities in the tutorial system
| for the improvement of American
: universities, and he discusses the
1 merits and faults of systems and
j ideals of universities in England and
Germany. —E. E. W.
THE GENTLE LIBERTINE. By Col
ette. Farrar & Rim-hart. New
York. 19111. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
It is to be wondered why transla
tions of the books of Colette have
I so long been delayed. For at least
ten years her books have enjoyed
the greatest popularity in France,
i

t
' and as a rule the United States does
not overlook European works of ex
cellence.
j Perhaps the delay was caused by
American timidity to put into writ
i ing that to which the French do
not give a passing thought. Rut still
jit is a shame to neglect such de
lightful books for needless timidity.
Colette writes with an almost un
equaled, facile charm. She draws
her characters with a light touch
but so cleverly that they become
completely real.
"The Gentle Libertine" is utterly
French. Its dialogue, description,
ideas, and outlook could be pro
, duced by none but a French woman.
The story is simple, tracing the life
of the little girl, lVLinne, through
childhood and marriage. But for
I entertainment and charm it is ex
celled by few books indeed.

THE GANG BUSTER—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Jack Oakie goes William Haines
j and tries a "Remote Control," Para
mount titling the result "The Gang
Buster."
Oakie is seen as a super-supersti
tious sap who leaves the farm to
sell accident insurance in the city,
which to his horror he finds is run
by gangsters who ruin his business.
"Naughty, Naughty!" says Oakie,
and proceeds to break up the gang,
and at the same time rescuing the
beautiful heroine from the viper and
saving her father from extermina
tion.
If you don't try to take it seri
ously, you will find it entertaining
enough. —L. C.
