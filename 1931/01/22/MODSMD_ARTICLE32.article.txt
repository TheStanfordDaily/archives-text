CONTEMPT INSTEAD OF PUNISHMENT

The Editor, Sir:
The perennial matter of what is
to be done about the honor system
is again up for discussion, and I
should like to add my voice. I be
lieve that the essence of the system
has been misunderstood for some
years—for it seems to be the gen
eral belief that we have an "honor"
system because a student's class
mates are much more likely to catch
him cheating than any proctor would
be, and thus will make much better
reporters.
The first part of the idea is valid
enough. If a student is cheating, it
is practically certain that some of
his classmates will know it. It is the
second part of the idea that falls
down, for there is a firmly estab
lished principle of honor that says
we must not poach. That this prin
ciple may not be socially justified,
and that Mr. Dowell calls it "a false
sense of chivalry" have no effect on
its existence, and do not lessen its
efficacy. The '"honor" system can
have no dignity and little tfffect as
long as it runs counter to our deep
seated aversion to peaching, and our
contempt for informers. These con
stitute, whether we like it or not, a
true principle of honor.
But the system itself was intended

1 to be based on as firm a principle of
honor—that we must not offend
| against someone who is unpro
tected. It was for this reason that
the-proctors were removed, and the
word "honor" used to define the
system. And the system worked ad
-1 mirably until we became panic
stricken by a few violations, and
began multiplying penalties and es
tablishing better machinery for pun
ishment, of which the recent serious
attempt to make informers of us all
is the culminating blow.
For when we threaten the cheater
with actual punishment, we cease to
have a true honor system, and have
an inefficient and slipshod form of
• the proctor system. If the cheater
asumes a risk, other than that of
incurring social opprobium, he be
comes criminal, but not dishonor
able. (Similarly, if a man can be
punished for not paying a gambling
debt, that debt ceases to be a debt
of honor.) And the greater the risk
that the cheater assumes, the less
dishonorable we think him.
The conclusion is obvious. If we
do away with penalties, we will
have a true honor system. Perhaps
such a system will not work—very
likely it will take a college genera
tion to get rid of those who have
learned to cheat under the present
regime, and it may be difficult to
keep them from infecting the new
comers. But I think it will work.
I think that, by making the cheater
subject to the same contempt that
is due the informer, we will have
ay little of cheating as we have cf
informing now, and probably less.
