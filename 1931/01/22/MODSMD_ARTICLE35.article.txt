-1 sity claims that higher education has
I become democratic.
i While it is true that the capitalist's
j son and the cobbler's son, the poet's
son and the plasterer's sonâ€”all have
I access to college, is it all for the
i best?
i It is probably this popularizing of
| university education that has been
responsible for colleges changing
: from sedate sanctuaries of science
and culture to noisy, high-pressure,
and efficient dispensaries of so
' called practical knowledge.
A freshman at Rhode Island
State College caught flirting is
forced to wear a catcher's mask
for three days.
; i One wonders if the upperclassmen
are frightened at the competition;
' or are just attempting to save naive
frosh from becoming disillusioned
; too suddenly.
; Co-eds at the University of Chi
l cago have refused to support the
I local humor magazine because the
I monthly published a "Co-ed's
: Diary."
The women are justified in
their stand. Why should any
publication take it upon itself to
give away a co-ed's secrets of
war any more than to expose
the football team's signals?
Both lose their value if known to
] the general public; both are indis
pensable to success.
i To insui'e better interfraternity
feeling, Greek letter houses at
U.S.C. will exchange lunches with
' other groups.
The plan is excellent hut if
ant powder happened to he
found in some visiting athlete's
sugar, some nasty persons would
immediately blame the incident
on interfraternity rivalry.
