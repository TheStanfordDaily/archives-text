And tonight, Ladeez (and those
I gentlemen that happen to be inter
ested) Stanford's own little three
j ring circus comes to its glowryuss
! finalley, with the trained elephants
! jumping through hoops as usual,
and the clowns providing amuse
ment for all with their simply ex
crooshiating antics. We'll be back
i again next year with the same show,
but different trappings.
"How many packages do you
smoke a day?" we heard a fair co-ed
; ask a not-so-fair rough, who was
1 inserting a "tailor-made" into his
i mouth.
"I don't smoke the packages, just
the cigarettes," was the retort devas
j tating. He made a beautiful corpse.
Now that the 500 have revealed
their date-rating system, a member
of the 3000 arises to announce that,
if the masculine element in dear old
L.S.J.U. did any such rating, a large
| portion of the batting order would
I never leave the bench. But then, of
j course, you can't print that sort of
thing.
| We see by the Campus Opinion
column that Bertha Deane While,
who signs herself "A Swarthmor-
I ean," believes that students should
j wear coats, ties, vests, and other
| impedimenta in dormitory dining
| rooms. Eneina Commons, apparent-
I ly, is just a name to Bertha Deane.
Our rough's fair name 'Swarthmore
'n that, Bertha dear. (Not bad—but
not too good.)
