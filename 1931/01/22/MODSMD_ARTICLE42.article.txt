MAN TO MAN
Having pickcd Stanford to win
from California in yesterday's paper,
we are going to pick Stanford to
win from California in today's and
tomorrow's papers. Yesterday we in
jected a note of levity into the per
formance; today and tomorrow we
will be serious.
Man-for-man, Stanford and
California are evenly matched
in the matter of cagers. Both are
fairly strong defensive teams,
with the Indians having an edge
here; California leans more
heavily to offense than the Red
skins do. Result: A toss-up. •
California basketball teams oper
ate on the principle of outscoring
their opposition; Stanford as yet has
not completely discovered how to
take advantage of a fast-breaking
offense. Consequently the Bears are
apt to score more goals. But Stan
ford can play defensively with any
team in the business; consequently
the Bears are apt to have few
chances to score goals.
A peek at the positions dis
closes a stalemate, too. At cen
ter, California puts forward a
tall gentleman named Read. In
spite of Read's height, Reynolds
should out-jump him. The Bears
feed their center under the bas
ket; so do the Indians. A slight
edge may he nullified by Read's
superior shooting.
At: guard, tho Blue and Gold has
Captain Joel the Coffield and Carl
Vendt. Coffield sinks his shots from
all angles, and takes his share in
the guarding business, too. Vendt is
an experienced man. Vance Faw
cett and Rudy Rintala, with Captain
Mike Reynolds, form an almost im
pregnable defense; Rintala is apt to
break up a game with his shooting
while Fawcett's floor work is un
equalled. A slight edge to Stanford.
The forwards wearing Blue
and Gold are Kintana and Davis.
They get results. Moffatt and
Cordry, bottled up by the Tro
jans, sank very few field goals
last week. Since a forward
should shoot a goal now and
then, this section gives a slight
advantage to Nibs Price and
crew.
And with the men apparently a |
stand-off, we get down to that old I
stand-by, psychology. Here it is
that Stanford has a big edge. Four- j
teen consecutive victories on the I
hardwood does California hold, and j
a like number of defeats are chalked :
up against Stanford in the past few :
years' records.
With a record like that be
hind them, the Indians will be
on the war-path Saturday night.
And since a team that won't be
beaten can't he beaten . A
team cannot lose forever. Stan
ford can win, will win from
California this time.
