# National Prep School Athletic Meets Doomed
## COLLEGES WIN FIGHT TO END BIG TOURNEYS Loyola University Defies Association; Will Hold Meets Anyway 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 21. (VP) â€” The
North Central Association of Col
leges and Secondary Schools has
won another fight in its battle to
abolish national high school athletic
tournaments.
Northwestern University, through
Director of Athletics Kenneth "Tug"
Wilson, last night announced dis
continuance of its national inter
scholastic track, swimming, and
wrestling meet, a carnival 18 years
old.
Chicago Obeys
The University of Chicago recent
ly obeyed the recommendations or
oider of the Association by abolish
ing its annual high school basket
ball tournament, a national classic
for many years.
Loyola University of Chicago so
far has been the only institution to
defy the Association in the fight, de
ciding to continue its national
Catholic prep basketball tourna
ment.
Warnings Last Year
Through the influence of the Na
tional Federation of State High
School Athletic Associations, the
North Central body last spring
warned all its membership that it
must discontinue such national
meets or run the risk of disbarment
from its body.
Most of the universities, colleges,
and secondary schools belong to the
Association and disbarment from its
group means that no student's cred
its would be accepted at an accred
ited institution.
Northwestern's tournament at
tracted 850 athletes last spring.
