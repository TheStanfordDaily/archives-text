# WRESTLERS, ANCIENT AND MODERNâ€”Feg Murray
## 
### 
One of the two current heavy
| weight wrestling champions is a
Greek by the name of Jim Londos,
J a fine, big, powerful fellow, more
picturesque than Don George, the
rival claimant of the title, who is
champion in California and Massa
| chusetts. Londos is recognized as
I champ in New York and Pennsyl
i vania, and by the National Boxing
Association.
| Londos beat Dick Shikat for the
title last year, while George de
feated Sonnenberg. Last December
Londos won in spectacular fashion,
from Ferenc Holuban, in a match
that drew twenty-five thousand to
Madison Square Garden. The return
to popularity has delighted Jacques
Curley, the Czar of all the Pachy
derms in New York, and worried
j those who have the interest of the
| fast-declining boxing racket at
heart.
Mythical Wrestlers
A popular show now running in
i New York is called "The Greeks
Had A Name For It." There is some
! doubt as to just what it was the
; Greeks had a name for, but I am
! sure it was " 'rasslin'." Ever since
I Greece got on the map there have

been Greek wrestlers.
Ancient history is full of accounts
of birds like Milo of Crotona, hero
of six Olympiads. Milo trained by
carrying a young calf around, and
as the calf grew up, the wrestler
grew stronger and bigger, until
finally he was packing a full-grown
ox around on his back for exercise!
Then, one day, he got hungry and
killed and ate the whole on all in an
hour! (It may sound like a lotta bull
to you, but your old pal Homer
wouldn't kid you. Not much.)
Modern Greeks Rough
Then there was a wrestler named
Arrichion, who was awarded a vic
tory in a wrestling match even as
he died! Held in the vice-like grip
of Arcadian's arms and legs, Arri
chion seized his opponent's foot and
twisted it out of its socket, forcing
him to give up. The winner then ex
pired, and was unable to receive
the prize.
The Greeks were a bit rough in
those days, all right, and if you'd
seen Londos pick up that bull
necked Holuban and slam him onto
the mat you'd think the modern
Greeks were a bit rough, too. Londos
meets J.im McMillen in a match at
the Garden on January 26.
