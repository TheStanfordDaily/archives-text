# HUNTER JOINS RANKS OF PRO TENNIS STARS
## Hunter To Make His Debut In Madison Square Garden Feb. 18 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 21 (TP).—Francis
T. Hunter, former doubles partner
of William T. Tilden, member of the
United States Davis Cup Team and
second ranking tennis player in the
United States for the past two years,
decided today to follow his friend
and partner into the professional
tennis ranks.
Hunter announced today he would
make his debut as a professional
along with Tilden in Madison Square
Garden on February 18. No arrange
ments have yet been made for a
match for Hunter on the day when
Tilden will play Karel Kozeluh, fa
mous Czecho Slovakian professional.
He will not. be able to accompany
Tilden on his professional tour, but
will play in the east whenever his
other interests permit. Hunter is
engaged in the publishing business in
New Rochelle, N.Y.
Famed for Drives
A veteran player, famed for his
powerful drives, Hunter never has
been able to scale the peak of the
national championship. On two oc
casions he was runner-up, carrying
the colors of the United States
against Henry Cocllet of France in
1928 and losing to Tilden in the 1929
finals. He was placed second in the
national rankings both years.
Due to the pressure of business
and the fact that Tilden, his in
separable companion in tournament
play, also was out of action, Hunter
took part in few tournaments during
the 1930 season. As Tilden's doubles
partner Hunter made an even more
impressive record than in singles
play. Their big year was 1928, when
they won the national doubles
championship and the Davis Cup
doubles.
