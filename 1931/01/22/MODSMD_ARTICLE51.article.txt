# HABLES RUNS GOOD RACE IN INFORMAL SPRINTS YESTERDAY
## 
### 
With the fast time of 37:7 for the
352-yard run, within 5-10 of a sec
ond of the best time ever recorded
iii this event at Stanford, Les
Hables, running in an informal series
of races held yesterday, upset all
the dope by beating Ben Eastman,
sophomore flash. Eastman, left at
the post, was never able to over
come the substantia] lead built up
by Hables.
In both the sprint events, in which
even time was made, Lombardi
broke the tape before Giberson and
Jimmy Willson, freshman star
sprinter. Brown, who has been bat
tling with Storms since the begin
ning of the year, took the measure
of the latter in yesterday's three
lap race. Bobby Birch of the fresh
men came in a good third in this
race.
Tomorrow the usual weekly meets
will be resumed. Three quarter dis
tances will be the order of the day.
Close contests are expected in the
660 and 352 events.
