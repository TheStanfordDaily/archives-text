# BUNN COACHES BABE TEAM IN FUNDAMENTALS
## Coming Contest With U.C. Freshmen On Saturday Will Tax Papooses 
### Lowell Cox 
The ABC's of basketball again j
occupied the attention of the fresh- j
man hoop squad yesterday after- ;
noon, when Coach John Bunn trot- ,
ted the yearlings through a strenu- |
ous session on fundamentals.
In view of the tepid showing of '
the babes in their contests of last i
week-end, Coach Bunn is still un- \
decided as to what lineup he will j
start against the California Cubs |
Saturday night.
Today's practice is expected to be !
the last stiff workout before the tilt, j
with a polishing-off tomorrow. Some j
idea of the starting quintet will ;
probably become apparent in to- i
day's practice.
Papooses Collapse
Even before the collapse of the j
Papoose five in the Menlo and Palo i
Alto games of last Friday and Sat
urday nights, the California babes !
were considered to hold an edge j
over the Farm yearlings, in view of !
the crushing defeat the Berkeley
team administered to the Stockton j
high-school five.
California downed the preps 40 to j
18, while the Indian youngsters I
were held to a 32 to 26 count.
Should the yearlings snap out of I
their slump and return to the form '
they exhibited in early season
games, they will have an almost
event chance Saturday night.
But in the event that they should
perform as against the Palo Alto
prep five, admittedly a sub-par team
this year, the result will be nothing
less than disaster.
