# EASTON, GLEDHILL VIE FOR STAR NET POSITION TODAY
## 
### 
I/EITII GLEDHILL and Ted
Easton will vie for the hon
orable position of tennis cham
pion of the University this af
ternoon on the varsity courts.
Gledhill is rather strongly fa
vored to win, but Easton's
steady stroking may gain him
a good many points before the
match is over. Whatever the
outcome, the fact remains that
some excellent tennis is on
hand for local fans today.
Defending his positions as
first man among the freshmen,
Chuck Otis will meet Monte
Shwayder tomorrow in what
should be a high-class exhibi
tion.
Several names have been
added to the ladder match par
ticipants. On the varsity list
are Edwards and Wallace,
while amongst the freshmen
Kneisley, Ellingwood. Johnson,
and Woodward have joined the
ranks.
