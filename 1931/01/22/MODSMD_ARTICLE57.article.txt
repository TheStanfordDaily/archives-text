## Keilh Gledhill Tops List Of Players; Easton In Second Place 
### 
By Richard Van Wagenen
With most of last year's tof)-rank
ing players back in the 1931 lineup
and one star of the first magnitude
added for good measure, Stanford
tennis fans can look forward to a
highly successful season in the
spring months this year.
Keith Gledhill, a nationally known
racket-wielder who was ineligible
for varsity play last year, has
stepped into the lead position which
John Doeg vacated last winter and
is being counted on to sweep
through all Pacific Coast college op
ponents without a defeat, thus en
abling Card supporters to count on
one singles victory in almost every
contest.
Easton Pressing Gledhill
Ted Easton, ranking number two
on the team, is only slightly inferior
to Gledhill, having given him a
couple of tough battles this year,
while Hary Plymire and Joe Cough
lin, who will fill out the list of
singles players, are both capable
men and have had plenty of tour
nament experience.
Supporting this group there are
Chuck Weesner, ranking number
five, Phil Niederauer, number six,
Trow Stephens, number seven, Bob
Forbes, number eight, Russ Robin
son, number nine, and Wilbur Cox,
number ten.
Team Has Seven Seniors
The experience of the squad mem
bers is shown by the fact that out
of the first ten, seven. Easton, Ply
mire, Weesner, Niederauer, Steph
ens, Forbes, and Cox, are in their
final year of competition.
Despite the strength of the Red
skin team, plenty of competition is
expected from the other coast col
leges, with U.C.L.A. looming as the
biggest hurdle to be cleared. Elbert
Lewis, Bruin star, is expected to
give Gledhill plenty of argument in
the singles, while Dworkin and
Lewis will make up a formidable
doubles team to oppose the Cardi
nals.
