## 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Jan. 21 (TP).
A boat speed of 150 miles an hour !
is not far away says Gar Wood of
Detroit, who is here seeking a ]
world's record with his Miss America j
IX. * [
"It's only a question of power," j
he remarked as he worked along the 1
ways in preparation for his attempt
on the record March 17 and 18.
"We'll have a new world record
the next time we go out after it,'' he 1
predicted confidentially. "If we
can't get it with the engines we al
ready have, there are engines avail- ;
able that will give it to us."
