Capt. Malcolm Campbell of England shown here at the wheel of his automobile, "Bluebird," in which he will try for a world speed
record on the sands of Daytona Beach, Fla. He hopes his 1,400-horsepower racer will travel 250 miles an hour. The present 231-mile mark was
set by Major Segrave. The "Bluebird," featuring new principles of design, is built to deflect air currents and minimize wind resistance.
