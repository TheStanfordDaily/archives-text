# REDSKINS SEEK FIRST U.C. WIN IN FIVE YEARS
## Stanford Victory Saturday Would Make Success Of 1931 Season TEAM HAS NEW LIFE 
### Jack Jernegan 
Coach John Bunn and the Stan
ford varsity basketball team can
make a complete success of their
season tomorrow night.
If, when the timekeeper's final gun
sounds through the wide oj)en spaces
of the Oakland Auditorium the
number under the "S" on the score
board is larger than that under the
"C," tlie 1931 season will be unani
mously declared to be the most sat
isfactory known to this generation
of Stanford students.
For five long years Cardinal fans
have waited and hoped longingly for
a victory over the Golden Bear bas
keteers, without getting it. Now
they have a new coach, a new sys
tem, new life in the team, new
hope in the fans. It is by no means
outside the bounds of possibility
that this Cardinal team is equal to
the California quintet.
Frosh in Prelim
Tomorrow night will tell the
story. Starting at 8 o'clock after the
freshman preliminary at 6:30, Stan
ford's hoopsters will take the floor
against their ancient foes from
Berkeley to decide whether the
Cardinal can at last compete on
even terms with the Blue and Gold
in this sport.
All this week the Redskins have
been working in secret, with Coach
Bunn driving them constantly for
speed and punch. Yesterday the In
dian mentor gave his charges a last
strenuous workout, running them in
a long skirmish against the Grays,
and the results of the week's work
began to be apparent.
Vance Fawcett's left arm, which
has caused Coach Bunn some anx
iety regarding the chances for vic
tory Saturday, seems to be nearly
normal again, having healed more
quickly than the most optimistic had
hoped.
Team Works Fast
The men were moving faster, get
ting the ball in under the basket
with more precision, and dropping
the ball more accurately through
the hoop than in any previous prac
tice this year.
It was a long, tough scrimmage,
and toward the end of it the first
string men looked pretty tired, with
a resulting falling off in their work,
but it was apparent that Bunn had
given them the idea of a formidable
ottack. They looked as though they
only need the stimulus of actual
competition to make that attack
click with a vengeance.
Having by now definitely decided
upon the most effective quintet
which he can form out of the men
available, Coach Bunn will start the
same lineup used against U.S.C.
Cordry and Moffatt will hold down
the forward berths, Reynolds will
take center, and Fawcett and Rin
tala are slated for the guard posts.
Nibs Price will also use the com
bination on which he has hitherto
relied. Kintana and Davis, forwards;
Read, center; Coffield and Vendt,
guards, make up the lineup.

story. Starting at 8 o'clock after the
freshman preliminary at 6:30, Stan
ford's hoopsters will take the floor
against their ancient foes from
Berkeley to decide whether the
Cardinal can at last compete on
even terms with the Blue and Gold
in this sport.
All this week the Redskins have
been working in secret, with Coach
Bunn driving them constantly for
speed and punch. Yesterday the In
dian mentor gave his charges a last
strenuous workout, running them in
a long skirmish against the Grays,
and the results of the week's work
began to be apparent.
Vance Fawcett's left arm, which
has caused Coach Bunn some anx
iety regarding the chances for vic
tory Saturday, seems to be nearly
normal again, having healed more
quickly than the most optimistic had
hoped.
Team Works Fast
The men were moving faster, get
ting the ball in under the basket
with more precision, and dropping
the ball more accurately through
the hoop than in any previous prac
tice this year.
It was a long, tough scrimmage,
and toward the end of it the first
string men looked pretty tired, with
a resulting falling off in their work,
but it was apparent that Bunn had
given them the idea of a formidable
ottack. They looked as though they
only need the stimulus of actual
competition to make that attack
click with a vengeance.
Having by now definitely decided
upon the most effective quintet
which he can form out of the men
available, Coach Bunn will start the
same lineup used against U.S.C.
Cordry and Moffatt will hold down
the forward berths, Reynolds will
take center, and Fawcett and Rin
tala are slated for the guard posts.
Nibs Price will also use the com
bination on which he has hitherto
relied. Kintana and Davis, forwards;
Read, center; Coffield and Vendt,
guards, make up the lineup.
Coach John Bunn and the Stan
ford varsity basketball team can
make a complete success of their
season tomorrow night.
If, when the timekeeper's final gun
sounds through the wide oj)en spaces
of the Oakland Auditorium the
number under the "S" on the score
board is larger than that under the
"C," tlie 1931 season will be unani
mously declared to be the most sat
isfactory known to this generation
of Stanford students.
For five long years Cardinal fans
have waited and hoped longingly for
a victory over the Golden Bear bas
keteers, without getting it. Now
they have a new coach, a new sys
tem, new life in the team, new
hope in the fans. It is by no means
outside the bounds of possibility
that this Cardinal team is equal to
the California quintet.
