# Rushing Period Ends As 78 Are Pledged By Nine Sororities
## Delta Gamma Leads With 17 Pledges; Chi Omega lakes Second Place With 16; Kappa Alpha Theta Third in List With 11 Preferences 
### 
CEVENTY-EIGHT women were pledged to Greek letter sororities last
night as formal rushing season closed after a two-weeks season. Last
year's total exceeded this year's by two. Delta Gamma won the derby
for the second successive year with seventeen pledges, and Chi Omega
came in second with sixteen. Eleven who expressed preferences were
guaranteed spring quarter bids from that house, their rushing to be
deferred until that time, according to the Pan-Hellenic ruling of last year.

'Six women went "undecided."
