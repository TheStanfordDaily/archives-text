# ROBLE INMATES GET SCREENS FOR BASTILE
## 
### 
Timing their activities nicely with
the recent discussion of the honor
code, comes a force of carpenters to
Roble, nailing down the screens of
all first-floor windows.
Roble, whatever may be the rela
tive charms of its inhabitants, has
not hitherto been characterized as a
young ladies' seminary.
Even those women who have ex
hausted the possibilities of the lock
out rule will hesitate to scuff satin
slippers and rip expensive formals in
climbing some five feet of sheet
stone wall to the haven of a sympa
thetic room-mate's arms.
