# Senate Provides Relief Millions; House Gets Bills
## Employment, Drought Help Possible At Once 
### 
WASHfNGTON, Jan. 22 (A*).â€”New
millions for immediate employment
and drought relief were voted by the
Senate today in passing the defic
iency bill, carrying almost $125,000,-
000 to become available immediately.
Chairman Jones of the Senate ap
propriations committee, estimated
the funds would provide employment
for more than 30,000 workers as soon
as the legislation is enacted. The
measure goes back to the house for
approval of amendments.
Responding to an urgent plea by
Senators Barkley of* Kentucky, and
Caraway, of Arkansas, both Demo
crats, Senator Jones accepted an ad
dition of $3,000,000 for medical sup
plies to be sent into the drought
areas.
The bill authorizing the medical
aid fund was sponsored by Senator
Robinson, Democrat, Arkansas, , and
had been approved today by the
agriculture committee but had not
been passed.

The deficiency bill carries $543,-
370 for employment of 130 additional
prohibition agents. Senator Tydings,
Democrat, Maryland, in a severe at
tack upon prohibition enforcement
lost an attempt to strike this out.
