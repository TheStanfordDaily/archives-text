# MEN'S COUNCIL SETS PENALTY IN CODE CASES
## Swain Sustains Punishment Meted Out To Two Men Students 
### 
Acting-President Robert E. Swain
yesterday approved penalties meted |
to two students for violation of the j
honor code by Men's Council last
Tuesday. The penalties are:
1. Each flunk Business Law (five
unit course).
2. Each attain a scholastic aver
age of plus 10 in their studies for
the current: quarter and be placed
on scholastic probation. Should they
fail to obtain the required honor
points they will automatically be
dropped from the University.
3. Each be placed on honor pro
bation and that their names be sent
jto the heads of their respective major
| departments.
4. Each shall work 50 hours at
j the Convalescent Home before the
| end of the present quarter.
Expulsion Is Threat
Should either of the men fail to
j fulfill any of the penalties, Dr. Swain
declared he would communicate
with the Men's Council to take ac- <
tion. Virgil Dowell, chairman of the
council, last night said the council
would probably expel the students if
they do not satisfy the demands of
the penalty.
The council chairman announced
that future violations of the code
brought before it for trial would
result in the suspension of the guilty
student for one quarter. The ap
proval yesterday of the council's
sentence is the end of the lenient
policy the council has been pursuing
because of its belief that the honor
system was not functioning properly,
Dowell declared.
Code Is Institution
The chairman said it was the
! opinion of the council that sufficient
j notice of the honor code as an in
j stitution had been brought before
the students' attention recently and
that if they failed to heed it they
would be dealt with as severely as
possible.
Dowell also stated that a general
investigation will be undertaken
' shortly following reports of viola
tions in several large classes during
j final examinations last quarter. He
j declared that should the investiga
[ tion reveal definite cases of cheating,
i the students would be expelled from
: Stanford and the classes would be
| placed on honor probation.
