# ACT DANGEROUS TO MACDONALD CABINET BATTLED IN BRITAIN
## The
						House Of Commons Discusses Trades Disputes Act 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 22. (A>) — The 1
i Labor Government and the Con
' servativc opposition joined battle in
i the House of Commons today over 1
i the second reading of the Trades j
! Disputes Act, a measure considered
j to be fraught with the gravest dan- J
| ger for Premier Ramsay Mac Do
nald's cabinet.
Sir William Jowitt, the Attorney- ■
General, moved the second reading,
and rejection of the bill was imme- ;
' diately asked by the Conservative
j leader, Stanley Baldwin.
| The Trades Disputes Act has
i aroused the bitterest political feel- j
j ings of the present session and it is
! expected that if the Government is
defeated on a division, likely to
1 come next Tuesday, it will resist.
