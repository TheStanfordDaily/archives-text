## 
### 
Stanford freshmen undergo the
most intense scrutiny accorded to
rare specimens of the genus man.
They are the laboratory for all aca
demic experiments and the victims
of all social bait. Statistics can be
had on their dimensions, finances,
and intelligence quotients. They arc
prime objects of curiosity and re
cipients of all excess good will.
But the University of Syracuse
has preceded us with a "clinic for
co-eds," where, under direction of
the dean of women, the freshman
girl is studied and catalogued as to
academic pursuits, friendships, re
creation, clothes, love affairs, re
ligious ideas, vocational aspirations,
use of money, contacts with home
and personal habits. The following
data has been compiled by the clinic:
They Smoke Now
That 33.5 per cent of the girls
smoked in high school, while 41 per

| cent have the habit in collegeâ€”a
! gain of 7.5 per cent in the change |
1 from home restrictions to campus
freedom.
Eighty-five per cent of the first
| year girls already have decided what
I their work is to be after graduation.
Twenty-three per cent of the co
-1 eds avowed they had been in love
many times; eight per cent said they
had had occasional "crushes" on
boys; 21 per cent said they had been
; in love twice; 10 per cent said they
I had loved once; 31 per cent said
i they had never been in love.
