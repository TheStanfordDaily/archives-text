## President Has No Personal Proposal To Offer 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (A').â€” j
President Hoover's emphatic disap
proval of the Wickersham Commis- j
sion's proposed revision of the 18th
| amendment was held today by Sena- ;
tor Fess, Republican, Ohio, not to i
have closed the White House door to i
j all suggestions for revision.
No Revision Expected
The chairman of the Republican ,
National Committee stated carefully, j
however, he did not mean to imply (
the President had any particular ;
; revision or modification in mind, j
Fess visited the White House yester
; day.
It was to this latter view that Re- I
publican Leader Watson subscribed, j
He said:
Message Interpreted
"I interpret his message as dry."
The Indiana Senator added, how- I
1 ever, that he had not talked with !
President Hoover about prohibition 1
since the variously interpreted mes- i
, sage was given to Congress along j
I with the law enforcement commis>- j
I sion's diverging views upon the dry
law.
While these statements were com- j
! ing from Capitol Hill, enough of the I
story behind the commission's con- I
flicting report was disclosed to indi- '
cate the prolonged dispute and con- j
: troversy that ended in the writing j
i of this document.
