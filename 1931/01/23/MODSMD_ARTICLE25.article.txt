# Committee Flays Students, Drafts Honor Code Edict
## A.S.S.U. Body Adopts Two Proposals To Be Submitted To Academic Council at "Earliest Possible Date"; Declare Time for Action Has Come RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED AT SPECIAL SESSION 
### 
INSTITUTING a concerted attack on the manifestly indifferent attitude
of the student body toward the present degraded state of the Honor
System, the Executive Committee of the Associated Students, in special
session with representatives of the faculty yesterday afternoon, adopted
two definite proposals to be submitted to the Academic Executive Com
mittee at "the earliest possible date." Unanimously conceding that the
time for immediate action had arrived, the legislative organ of the

A.S.S.U. resolved:
"That the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students of Stanford
University hereby recommend to
Acting-President Robert E. Swain
that he lay the following proposals
before the Academic Executive
Committee at the earliest possible
date:
1) That no written work to be
used as a basis for grades be cor
rected unless there be appended a
personally written and signed pledge,
as follows: "I hereby certify on my
honor that I have neither given nor
received aid in this test (report or
examination)."
2) That all faculty members be
requested to remind their classes
before each examination, quiz, or re
port assignment that the Honor
is an institution at Stanford and that
students are expected to conduct
themselves accordingly by doing
their own work unaided, and by
giving no help to others.
Submitted To Swain
The resolution was submitted to
Dr. Swain last night. The acting
president expressed commendation
of its provisions and declared that
he expected good results from them.
He turned the proposals over to J.
Pierce Mitchell, Registrar, since he
is leaving today for the East, but
promised action on the matter early
next week.
While aware of the violations of
the code at the present time, those
present at the meeting were of the
opinion that adequate educational
measures would greatly x-educe, if
not eliminate, hte existing evils. ..
"Your problem, as the organ
of the student government, is
that of showing those students
who do not obey the Code, that
they are only cheating them
selves and their fellow students
—not the instructor," pointed
out Professor Edwin A. Cottreil,
head of the political science de
partment. "I believe that putting
the signed pledge proposal into
operation will eliminate a great
many violations."
Professor Cottreil firmly opposed
the suggestion if an optional proc
tor system attached to the present
Honor Code. He declared that en
forcement of th 3 Code should be
