# THE 						BATTLE OF THE AMAZONS
## 
### 
Well, the last gun has been tired. The treaty of peace is signed. I
The I'ive llundred breathe a huge sigh of relief as the warfare of'
rushing is over.
And as the big parade went up the row last night there were vic
tors and prisoners and dead and wounded scattered all over the fem
inine campus. The battle of the Amazons brought death and de
struction for some; for some, spoils and booty. Well, it's the old
army game. And it's much the better, like the World War, for
being in the past.
