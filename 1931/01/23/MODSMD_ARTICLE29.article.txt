# POOR PUBLICITY
## 
### 
\ nee line 01 liquor drinking among college students was reported
recently at a meeting of the Council of Church hoards of Educa
tion in Indianapolis. And it was further stated that only college
"prohibition problem" remaining is that of idle sons of wealthy
families.
From such a statement it might be implied that "poor but
honest" folks are simon piire, and never, never do they touch liquor, i
I lilt those scions of wealthy familiesâ€”mv, my.
There never have been any noticeable money distinctions at
Stanford, even in the quantity or quality of liquor consumed. A
lellow hard-pressed for cash can always Hud money for liquor, if
he should so desire.
This is 110 implication that college students are all confirmed I
drunkards, or even that the latest report is incorrect. But it does'
seem impossible that anybody could make an accurate survey of the !
amount of liquor consumed by college students or any group of
people. College students should not be singled out for such publicitv.
