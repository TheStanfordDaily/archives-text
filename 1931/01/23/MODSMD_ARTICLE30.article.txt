# PUNISH TO DETER
## 
### 
'I lie action of the Men's Council in penalizing two students for
violation of the honor code in last quarter's examinations, marks the '
end of the present lenient policy the council has been pursuing be-1
cause of the belief that student observance of the code has been lax. |
1 lereafter, and rightly so, all students will he suspended from '
Stanford if they arc guilty of cheating or any other violation. And j
ihe council's warning that where classes arc suspected of violating!
the code the entire class will he placed on probation, comes as an
indication that the council will no longer passively enforce the pro- ,
visions of the code.
There has been sufficient notice to the students that the honor
code is in force at this institution. Should they see fit to continue to j
violate the code, the council should impose severe sentences.
The only means whereby the code can be enforced is to instill I
into every student the realization that disgrace and stigma will re- j
suit if violations occur, hear of punishment is the only deterrent ;
1 bat stops predations of habitual criminals.
