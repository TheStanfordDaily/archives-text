# TOO MANY MILITARISTS

### 
Let us thank what (iods may be that Southern California does !
not have military training, either elective or compulsory. Ii is safe j
in say that the appearance of our campus wouldn't be improved
much by the presence of boots and spurs and the idiotic dignity at- 1
tending them.
What prompts this outburst is the recent unsuccessful attempt 1
of Representative F. IT. LaCuardia of New York to have federal ,
aid withheld from land-grant colleges which persist in retaining this 1
relic barbarism engendered out of fear.
Jle and others have also ridiculed the battleship modernization
program. I nfortunately they are too much in the minority to ac
complish anything in the way of a liberal program against militar
ism. Let us hope against likelihood that their day will come soon.—
