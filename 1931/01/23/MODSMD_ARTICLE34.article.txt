REI) RUST—By V. Kirchon and A.
Ouspensky. Brentano's.
The co-authors of this play had,
doubtless, some great message for
the world, but they have so skilfully
covered their sermon with ancient
theatrical tricks and sensationally
inclined sentiment, plus the usual
"J'm going-to-have-a-a" scene, that
it is undefinable.
The plot makes gay with Con
stantine Therekhine, husband of
Olga Ebinovalvski, who has tired of
his current mistress, Nina Vergan
skiaia, and runs after trollop Lisa
and pure little Mania Levineeriaia
after having murdered one or the
other of them. Surrounding all is the
Gorkian, suicidal atmosphere.
It's the ultra-art drama that the
Theatre Guild dishes out annually
between production of such box of
fices as Molnar, Behrman, Shaw, and
O'Neill. —J. S. S.
