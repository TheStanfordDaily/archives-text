Today's the day when they all
crow at each other, up and down
the Row, and say "Look what Santa
Claus brought us!" At least, even
that one particular Dumbest Fresh
man won't blame this pledging busi
ness on the stork—we hope—even
though a few people are being given
the bird ....
Funny tiling, isn't it, that as
soon as the actual agony is over
with, they're all "the best nugget
in the class, my dear—we're so
proud of her!"
Despite the rain, the usual num
ber of serenading swains cluttered
up sorority driveways. Who says
that Romance is dead? She's only
taking a rest cure, out of circula
tion, on a diet of soprano, sobriety,
and spinach.
Picture the embarrassment of the
practical joking sophomore, mas
querading as a sorority pledge, who
found himself in a practical house
that put its pledges to work, the
minute they stepped inside the door.
Oh, so that's what all the noise
was about at the KITTY KAT
house last night? ....
Also today, time-mellowed Roble
ans take stock of their new class. |
Personally, we think Roble pledge
night in the City sounds more in- j
teresting than anything the campus j
has to offer. And it's lots easier to
snub a disliked sister, there, among
such a crowd of 'em.
Breathing deep, we wonder about
the basketball game with Cal, to be
played in Oakland tomorrow night. :
Even our own worthy Sports Editor 1
doesn't seem to be able to make up
his mind about the final score — I
somewhere in the hundreds, we
trust! Oh, for the life of a hoopster,
tra la! If you lose, you played a
rotten game. If you win, the score
.should have been bigger. We're
banking on them, though. The Dekes j
always were good at arithmetic, and
geometry, and triangles.
