# CAMPUS OPINION
## GETTING IN THE SUN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Our school has through the years !
i done much to attain the enviable i
; standing it has among all universi- ;
j ties; hardly a month goes by that
j she does not add to her glories. But j
1 we see by reason of the reputation, j
j a fallacy of education common to j
| all American schools, and perhaps j
i a little more noticeable here.
The pre-eminent goal of many |
1 students to obtain superior grades
[ and high numbers of grade points I
, detracts from the fundamental pur
: pose of education, that of gaining |
I excellence in the work undertaken.
It is not entirely paradoxical that !
the one does not follow the other,
| for when the obtaining of grades is
paramount, the other is necessarily ;
i reduced in the endeavors of the stu
-1 dent. That this is somewhat the case j
; is evidenced by our recent trouble
I with students who value a grade |
j even above their obligation to the >
Honor Code.
It would seem that European
' schools are more advanced in a sys- (

j tem of meeting these problems than
i any American university; neverthe
less, there is an indication of a
change here when such schools as
; the University of Chicago and Johns
i Hopkins make the progressive steps
j they recently have.
I Students entering such foreign
j schools as Oxford or Edinburgh, are
j given use of the facilities and fac
j ulty of the institution, and what
! they get out of it rests entirely in
I their own hands. They may spend
| a couple of years experimenting in
I different courses and in departments
j of instruction. When they find the
i work in which they are adapted,
' only their ambitions need limit them
I in the pi'ofieiency they can gain.
If, after completion of the work,
| the students are deemed by the
; faculty and the showing they make
| in a final examination, as capable
of efficiently practicing their pro
j fession, they are awarded a degree.
Stanford has just received $100,000
; for the benefit of her educational
| system. Why could not she spend a
i portion of this sum in studying the
I feasibility of introducing a similar
i system of education in America, and
| thus put herself even more in the
â–  sun?
I Sincerely, L. C. Pence.
