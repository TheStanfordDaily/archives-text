### 
Today we present the resurrection
of an ancient bit of blarney released
: in an incautious moment by our old
friend, Bill Aldwell, who is at the
moment somewhere in the wilds of
Germany wrestling the lan
j guage and potations of the stodgy
I Teutons, and is therefore unable to
do anything about our pillaging his
i thesaurus. Here goes:
"A bee!"
Said he.
He swung.
Missed!
Damn!
Stung!
"A flea!"
Said she.
"Some Flit!"
Missed!
Damn!
Bit!
"A fiy!"
Said I.
I grabbed.
Missed!
Damn! *
Stabbed!

P.S.
That
Was
No
Fly
That
Was
* A
Skeeter.
