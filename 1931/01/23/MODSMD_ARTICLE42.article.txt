Stanford Indian
On November 22. a Stanford
varsity swamped a California
football team by a record Big
(iame score. On January 24, a
Stanford basketball squad tan
tries with a Bine and Gold outfit
across the bay. And it will be
something of a record if Stan
lord wins.
Stanford can win tomorrow night,
ul notwithstanding .... It will
ike 40 frenzied minutes of basket
ill to beat the Berkeley team; two
tiods of light defensive play plus
i air-tight defense wili bring the
■d-clad hoopsters through to their
ist victory since 1925.
Looking back over ihc dim
pages of history, we recall many
clashes with California, all end
in!,' in the same fashion. !:i !!(- !,
at Kezar Stadium, the lledshirts
came close in the first of a three
game series. That was the yc.fr
when Louis Vincent! led the
Indians.
II was a hectic struggle. Vincenti
the midst of one of the most un
mrty shooting streaks we have
/or seen, and he could not miss,
ted" Thompson and Harlow Roth
•I, the sophomore guards, bottled
p the Bear's offense, and Stanford
•d until the final two minutes of
lay.
Kept in the game by "Farmer"
Dougery's long tosses, which
eventually shattered the Cardi
nal defense, the Bears put on a
scoring spurt in the closing mo
ments of the evening, and
wrested a hotly-contested scrim
mage from the embattled deni
zens of the Stanford Farm. That
was as close as yours truly has
ever seen the locals come to a
win over U.C.
<. <j> 4>
And so tomorrow night the lads
id lassies from the red-tiled Quad
ill enter the Oakland Auditorium,
iping for the best. If their hopes
e dashed, they will rise again, for
<e undergraduates are like that.
With Fawcett not quite him
self, Redshirt hopes fade. With
"Dazzy Vance" set, it will be a
hall game. How good a game it
will be remains to be proved on
the hardwood; we think that it
may be the most satisfactory
pjjic from the Stanford view
point in many a day.
If Bunn's proteges arc organized
hen the opening whistle shrills, if
toy can play the game they played
;ainst the Trojans on January 17,
will be quite a gala night. If.
jwever, they play as they did
jainst U.C.L.A. in the opening ses
on ■. it will be a sombre evening.
With a win in football already
posted iu the ledger, with a track
triumph a certainty, it would be
;i glorious year for Stanford if
a basketball conquest could be
added to the list of major sport
scalps snatched from the Golden
Bears. For should Stanford win
the lirst game, the Indians may
well move on and take the
series—for the first time since
I!)2i.
Such is the hoop situation, as seen j
rough the orbs of your humble

correspondent. Hope and fear min- j
I gle in his mind, but the hope is
j greater than the fear. From the few
glimpses he has had of the practices
(his week, it will he a big Red eve-
J ning tomorrow night. Selah!

On November 22. a Stanford
varsity swamped a California
football team by a record Big
(iame score. On January 24, a
Stanford basketball squad tan
tries with a Bine and Gold outfit
across the bay. And it will be
something of a record if Stan
lord wins.
Stanford can win tomorrow night,
ul notwithstanding .... It will
ike 40 frenzied minutes of basket
ill to beat the Berkeley team; two
tiods of light defensive play plus
i air-tight defense wili bring the
■d-clad hoopsters through to their
ist victory since 1925.
Looking back over ihc dim
pages of history, we recall many
clashes with California, all end
in!,' in the same fashion. !:i !!(- !,
at Kezar Stadium, the lledshirts
came close in the first of a three
game series. That was the yc.fr
when Louis Vincent! led the
Indians.

mrty shooting streaks we have
/or seen, and he could not miss,

•I, the sophomore guards, bottled
p the Bear's offense, and Stanford
•d until the final two minutes of
lay.
Kept in the game by "Farmer"
Dougery's long tosses, which
eventually shattered the Cardi
nal defense, the Bears put on a
scoring spurt in the closing mo
ments of the evening, and
wrested a hotly-contested scrim
mage from the embattled deni
zens of the Stanford Farm. That
was as close as yours truly has
ever seen the locals come to a
win over U.C.
<. <j> 4>
And so tomorrow night the lads
id lassies from the red-tiled Quad
ill enter the Oakland Auditorium,
iping for the best. If their hopes
e dashed, they will rise again, for
<e undergraduates are like that.
With Fawcett not quite him
self, Redshirt hopes fade. With
"Dazzy Vance" set, it will be a
hall game. How good a game it
will be remains to be proved on
the hardwood; we think that it
may be the most satisfactory
pjjic from the Stanford view
point in many a day.
If Bunn's proteges arc organized
hen the opening whistle shrills, if
toy can play the game they played
;ainst the Trojans on January 17,
will be quite a gala night. If.
jwever, they play as they did
jainst U.C.L.A. in the opening ses
on ■. it will be a sombre evening.
With a win in football already
posted iu the ledger, with a track
triumph a certainty, it would be
;i glorious year for Stanford if
a basketball conquest could be
added to the list of major sport
scalps snatched from the Golden
Bears. For should Stanford win
the lirst game, the Indians may
well move on and take the
series—for the first time since
I!)2i.
Such is the hoop situation, as seen j
rough the orbs of your humble

correspondent. Hope and fear min- j
I gle in his mind, but the hope is
j greater than the fear. From the few
