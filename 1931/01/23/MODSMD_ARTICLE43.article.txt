# Frosh Tangle With Bear Five Saturday
## BUNN WILL START TALL COMBINATION AGIST U.C. CUBS Tip-off Opens Preliminary Game at 6: 30 O'Clock; Jenkins To Start 
### Lowell Cox 
With the addition of Jenkins at I
guard, Coach John Bunn will start
the tallest freshman basketball com- j
I bination he has been able to muster '
this season against the undefeated j
California yearlings at Oakland to- j
i morrow night.
The opening tip-cfT, set for (i:3O i
o'clock, will find Packard at center, !
Massey and Topping, forwards, and j
Jenkins and Smith, guards.
i Alter "beginning all over" this i
week, following the collapse of the :
team in the games of last week-end, i
the Papoose squad showed some
' thing of their early season form in
scrimmage yesterday.
Defense Stressed
Following an hour's work on fun
damentals, which have been the fea- |
ture of frosh workouts all week, :
I Bunn sent his first-year charges !
through a tough scrimmage, with |
emphasis on defense. Offense was i
stressed in previous practices.
Yesterday's workout was the last
strenuous session before the game, !
as today's practice will consist of a
light polishing off.
i In spite of the improvement shown I
by the Papoose quintet, the Cali- ;
j forma babes will be favorites to re- I
( tain their undefeated status tomor- j
row night.
Cubs Undefeated
Where the Stanford yearlings have
been erratic, the Berkeley five has i
t steadily mowed down every one of j
| seven teams met. Wednesday night {
they trounced the St. Mary's fresh
' men, 4o to 28, in their final practice |
tussle.
Harold Eifert has been one of the
biggest factors in keeping the Cali
fornia frosh slate clean, being not
only a dead shot at the bucket, but
a fast floor man. He accounted for
j 1J tallies in the Galileo contest a j
; week ago. Coughlan trailed him j
j closely with 11 counters. This pair
, is expected to provide a busy eve
ning for the Papoose guards.
