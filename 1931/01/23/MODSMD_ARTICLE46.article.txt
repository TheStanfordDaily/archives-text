# NEW BASEBALL PARK NEAR COMPLETION: HAILED AS BEST COLLEGIATE DIAMOND
## 
### BY FRITZ GOODWIN 
On a diamond unrivaled by any j
' collegiate park in the country, the j
' Stanford baseball varsity will begin j
its Pacific Coast Conference sched- j
S ule next month. This park, the latest 1
i project in the Board of Athletic !
Control program, located at _ the j
1 runway end of the Stadium, is now
! nearly completed.
Formal opening and dedication of |
! the new baseball field v/ill occur 1
; during February, according to Don j
Liebendorfer, B.A.C. news service
' director, although ail varsity games
played before that time will take
i place there. The first of these prac- i
■ tice games is slated for Saturday, j
January 31, with the Olympic Club, j
Coach Praises Field
"One will have to look a long ■
j ways to find a larger, more modern,
I and more beautiful playing field j
than the new* Stanford park," says!
| Harry Wolter, head Indian baseball j
• coach. In the opinion of Liebendorfer 1
also the new diamond is the finest i
on any college campus.
The field is sunk 10 feet below j
the level of the adjacent ground,
j and is surrounded by the outfield
j fence, rising on the edge of the
earth embankment, Steel fences, and I
newly planted hedges. The entire j
inner area, both infield and outfield, I
| is covered with short trimmed turf, j
i and Lippia grass has been sown on j
I the sloping dirt banks of the out- j
field.

A new method of staking the bases
will be used on the diamond, the
bags being strapped lirectly above
posts permanently driven into j
ground. This is an original idea of j
Wolter's which will make base run- I
ning much safer, preventing acci
dents similar to that which occurred \
last year to Captain Bill Laird, who
broke his ankle sliding into a base i
stake.
The foul lines are marked by i
four-inch redwood posts, driven into
the turf..ln the right and left field
foul zones are two regulation home :
plates and pitching boxes, for warm
ing-up purposes.
Stands Seat 4500
The scoreboard is below the level
of the outfield fence, a good feature
in most parks, but one which seems !
rather unnecessary in the new Stan- i
ford field. The distance from the |
homo platter to the fence is longer
than on most fields, and very few.
if any, clouts will e\jer travel over
the board wall.
At the northern corner of the dia- I
mond modern and comfortable
stands have been erected on the
hillside, with a seating capacity of
4500. Fine press boxes and deep,
spacious dugouts arc features of the
stands, which are entered by three ;
gates and stairways.

also the new diamond is the finest i
on any college campus.
The field is sunk 10 feet below j
the level of the adjacent ground,
j and is surrounded by the outfield
j fence, rising on the edge of the
earth embankment, Steel fences, and I
newly planted hedges. The entire j
inner area, both infield and outfield, I
| is covered with short trimmed turf, j
i and Lippia grass has been sown on j
I the sloping dirt banks of the out- j
field.

A new method of staking the bases
will be used on the diamond, the
bags being strapped lirectly above
posts permanently driven into j
ground. This is an original idea of j
Wolter's which will make base run- I
ning much safer, preventing acci
dents similar to that which occurred \
last year to Captain Bill Laird, who
broke his ankle sliding into a base i
stake.
The foul lines are marked by i
four-inch redwood posts, driven into
the turf..ln the right and left field
foul zones are two regulation home :
plates and pitching boxes, for warm
ing-up purposes.
Stands Seat 4500
The scoreboard is below the level
of the outfield fence, a good feature
in most parks, but one which seems !
rather unnecessary in the new Stan- i
ford field. The distance from the |
homo platter to the fence is longer
than on most fields, and very few.
if any, clouts will e\jer travel over
the board wall.
At the northern corner of the dia- I
mond modern and comfortable
stands have been erected on the
hillside, with a seating capacity of
4500. Fine press boxes and deep,
spacious dugouts arc features of the
stands, which are entered by three ;
gates and stairways.
