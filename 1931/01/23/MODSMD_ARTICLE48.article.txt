## Promising Material Makes Up For Dearth Or Squad Numbers 
### 
With the uncovering of some
promising baseball material, Coach
Murray Cuddeback is losing his pes
simistic attitude toward his minia
ture freshman baseball squad of 14
players.
A week of practice indicates that
the frosh are going to have quality
even if they lack quantity. This
week's practice has uncovered a new
left-handed player from San Fran
cisco answering to the name of
Newton Goldm&nn. According to
Cuddeback, Goldmann has the mak
ings of a "peach of a player" pos
sessing lots of natural ability .He
will probably land in one of the
outfield berths.
Stanley Anderson, candidate for
the chucker's berth, may develop
into quite a slugger as well, Cudde
back says. Anderson may be in for
a season of hard work, since the
fresh mentor characterized him aa
"big and strong and capable of
standing a lot of work."
Arthur Hearne and John Bacon
are the remaining Papoose nuggets
that show promise for holding down
the first base sack. At the termina
tion of the hoop season the squad
will be augmented by James Massey
and Bob Maentz, and with the pos
sibility of a few more aspirants
turning out, the frosh roster may
yet reach standard size.
