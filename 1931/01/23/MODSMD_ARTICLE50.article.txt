# U.C. SPRINT STAR BEATS GREYHOUND IN 5 MILE JAUNT
## 
### 
DOB KEISEL, University of
California freshman, who is
officially credited with having
run the 100-yard dash in 9.7 in
high school, probably should be
given unofficial recognition for
some record or other in a'five
mile run which he turned in
last summer when pursuing one
of his father's greyhounds,
which had broken from the
leash and outdistanced the
high school flash until the final
lap of the chase.
Kciscl related the story to
Freshman Coach Alva Ragan
upon reporting for practice re
cently, adding that he had spent
the holidays training racing
dogs on his father's ranch.
