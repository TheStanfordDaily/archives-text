### 
A mild epidemic of injuries has
1 taken hold of "Dink" Templeton's
j track squad, keeping from practice
| ome of Stanford's most brilliant cin
j der path stars. Captain "Podge"
Smith, Hector Dyer, Jim Howell, and
George Naylon are all suffering from
one ailment or another. Don Black
man, who has been incapacitated by
| an appendicitis operation, will prob
| ably be out for practice next week,
i however.
With a gentle drizzle making the
; old track a very muddy oval, the
i runners on the track squad yester
| day worked out under the covered
1 passage of the stadium. Weather
I permitting, the usual weekly meets
will be held today at 4 o'clock. Full
distances will be run only in the
sprints, the longer races being cut
down to three-quarters of their
usual length.
