# ERNIE NEVERS TO PLAY WITH WEST AT KEZAR SUNDAY
## Former Stanford Grid Star Hailed As Best Back In Pro Football 
### "Stew" Crawford 
J Ernie Nevers, Stanford's all -
j American fullback of 1925, gi.f.'atest
j of all grid stars to play undei; "Pop''
Warner, and hailed today as the
best backfield man in professional I
football, will perform again for fans
on the West coast when East meets 1
West in the charity contest spon- j
sored by the Knights of Columbus I
in the Kezar stadium Sunday.
Nevers, who has been playing for
a professional team in Chicago, will i
| fill the fullback berth for the eleven
J representing the West. Not since his I
| last brilliant year on the Cardinal
team of 1925 under the tutelage of
Ihe Old Fox, have gridiron enthusi
asts on the West coast had the op
j portunity to witness the hard-driv- j
ing, line-ripping fullback.
The blond giant from Santa Rosa
lias the distinction of being one of
the four men selected by Knute
; Rockne as his choice for an all-time
[ backfield, a quartet which the South
Bend wizard named in a radio talk
| last season. Incidentally, Rockne did
; not pick one Notre Dame man on
| this combination, and no one can
| doubt that he has coached some of
j the nation's greatest.
"Jumping Joe" Savoldi and Russ I
■ Saunders will also play in the char
| ity contest. Savoldi, the ex-Notre
' Dame star, showed up well in pro
! fessional football after he was forced
| to quit school last autumn. Saunders
j will be remembered by most bay
| region fans as the star who led the
j Trojans to victory over Stanford in
■ 1929.
