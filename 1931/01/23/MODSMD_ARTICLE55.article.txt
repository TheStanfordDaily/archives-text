# STOVER TO MAKE REALISTIC STAGE SETS FOR DRAMA
## 'Wings Over Europe' Needs Correct Reproduction Of Famous Room 
### 
Characterization of "Wings Over i
Europe" as a dramatic extravaganza,
which to the designer in the theatre
connotes something reminiscent of
"Chu Chin Chow" or a follies, has
no force as a descriptive phrase, |
.states Frederick Stover, technical !
director.
Such a statement as "All throe acts j
take place at No. 10 Downing Street,
London, England, in the Council
Chamber reserved for the potentious
deliberation of the gentlemen of
destiny who control the vast affairs
of the British Nation," which is
'quoted from the first page of Act 1,
effectively restrains any designer
lrom indulging in any pet fancies.
By consulting all available de
scriptive and pictorial material, a
realistic likeness of the chamber
has been produced. lis high ceiling
and simple panelled walls suggest
a grave dignity and would be al- i
most austere in feeling were it not
for the well-proportioned Georgian
fireplace and mantle crowned by a 1
dark pediment and carrying as a I
background for a portrait of Rich
ard Walpole. The sides of the long
room are flanked by tall bookshelves ,
containing ponderous-looking legal
volumes.
Details Stressed
The smaller details leave nothing ;
to be desired and yet are almost
mean in their simplicity. A polished
oval table on which in front of each
place are flat leather portfolios with
the words, "Cabinet member, First I
Lord," inscribed in gold letters on
each cover. Two inkstands, a tele
phone, several ashtrays, and a mar- I
ble clock on the mantel complete j
the furnishings.
As planned by Stover, the set will
be an extremely accurate reproduc- (
tion of a room made famous by a j
long and distinguished line of states- j
men.
