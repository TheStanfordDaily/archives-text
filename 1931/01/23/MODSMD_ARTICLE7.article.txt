i there are 17 Williams, 17 Wilsons, j
16 Johnsons (only one from Minne- j
sota), 15 Millers, and 14 Jones'. That
Stanford has a colorful student body j
can bo seen by the fact, that there ■
are 8 Blacks, J Grays, 15 Whites, 3 ,
Greens, 1 Lavender, and I Redhead.

Trades and automobiles arc also
sprinkled about the Farm, there
being 8 Taylors, 2 Dyers, 2 Masons,
