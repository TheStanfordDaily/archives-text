# INDIAN CAGERS COME THROUGH AGAINST GEARS
## Overtime Contest Brings 37-32 Victory After 14 U.C. Triumphs REYNOLDS HIGH SCORER 
### Len Kullmann 
Stanford basketball came into its
own Saturday night.
In a hectic overtime clash the In
dians scalped the Bears, 37-32, for
the first Stanford victory in fifteen
meetings with the Blue and Gold,
and the Oakland Auditorium was
the scene of the carnage on Satur
day night.
Trailing 20-16 at half time, the
Indians put on a determined scoring
spree in the second period to draw
even with the Bears. With but a
minute left to play and the score
deadlocked at 28 all, Rintaja put
Stanford in front with a long bucket.
Bill Davis of California countered
with an equally distant toss, and the
game went into an overtime session.
Reynolds Sinks Technical
This same Davis opened the over
time with a bucket to put California
in front, 32-30, but Cordry came
back to sink a set-up and knot the
score once more. Little Tommy fol
lowed with a side-shot to put the
Redshirts in the lead. At this point
Price sent in Granger to replace
Read at center, and Granger proved
to be a conversationalist of no mean
ability. Reynolds sank the throw
awarded Stanford for Granger's
technical foul, and the game was on
ice, 35-32.
Adding insult to injury, Moffatt
and Fawcett teamed together to add
another field goal to the total. With
seconds to play, Moffatt sneaked un
der the California basket. Fawcett,
dribbling down the court, was
checked by a Californian, but batted
the tip-off which followed to Mof
fatt. "Nifty Phil" sank the final gflal
of the game without a soul near
him.
Five Stanford Heroes
A hero? Stanford had five of them.
First was Captain Mike Reynolds,
who took high-point honors with
eight free throws and two field
goals, and who kept the California
center covered whenever the Bears
threatened. Vance Fawcett, by his
brilliant floor work, his flawless de
fensive play, and his heads-up play
ing also deserves a niche in the
Redshirt Hall of Fame.
To Tommy Cordry goes the credit
for two vital field goals in the over
time session which were sorely
needed by Bunn's boys. Cordry's
speedy fioorwork also dazzled the
Bears.
"Nifty Phil," cool-headed, always
doing the right thing at the right
time, is the fourth hero of the game,
while Rudy Rintala completes the
roster. Rintala's three long goals
brought joy to the hearts of his
teammates; his first shot opened the
scoring of the game, while his third
in the closing moments appeared to
have given the Indians a victory.
Kintana, Davis Star
For California, Kintana and Davis
were the chief cogs in the Blue and
Gold machine. Together they ac
counted for 15 of the 32 California
points. Completely blanketed by the
Cardinal defense, Jack Read was
unable to gather more than two field
goals during the course of the eve
ning. The lanky Bear center's failure
to garner the largest quota of Blue
and Gold points was a big factor in
the Indian victory.
Displaying the same stout defense
which they have produced in other
tilts, the Indian cagers added a
swift-moving offense to their stock
in the California contest. Aided by
brilliant fioorwork on the part of the
guards and beautiful shooting by the
whole team, the Indians would not
be denied, and the final score indi
cates the margin of superiority.
Not unusually lucky in sinking
their shots, the Indians won because
of their superior teamwork. Missed
assignments under the basket on the
part of the Bears gave Stanford sev
eral set-up shots ,while the smooth
working Cardinal defense held the
Blue and Gold men to distant tosses.
Ability to capitalize on their free
throws also meant much to Bunn's
boys.
