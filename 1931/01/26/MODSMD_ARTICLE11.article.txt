DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Jan. 25
(/P). â€”Given a properly designed car
and an ideal course, land speed can
be raised indefinitely, Captain Mal
colm Campbell of England said to
day as he began final preparations
for his proposed assault on the
world's automobile speed record
here.
The 46-year-old speed veteran be
lieves, however, that there is no
known course in the world where a
land speed of more than 280 or pos
sibly 300 miles an hour can be at
tained.
"If it were possible to obtain a
perfect course and a rn3n had suf
ficient money to build a proper car,
with tires made to stand the pace,"
he said, "I say there is no limit to
the speed he could make."
