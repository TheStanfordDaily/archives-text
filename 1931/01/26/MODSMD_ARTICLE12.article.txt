HOLLYWOOD, CaL, Jan. 25 (/PL â€”
Another Coogan, Jackie's brother
Robert, will begin a screen career
tomorrow.
He has been signed by Paramount
for the role of Sooky, pal of Skippy,
in a filmization of "Skippy" from
Percy Crosby's cartoons and novel.
By coincidence, Robert Coogan will
make his screen debut at the age
of five, the age Jackie appeared in
his first motion picture, "The Kid,"
with Charles Chaplin. Jackie is
making a series of older boy pic
tures, the next of which will be
"Huckleberry Finn."
