ished today when informed the Brit
i ish government' had ordered his un
conditional release from prison along
with other members of the Nation
alist Congress working committee.

Irwin's act v/as conveyed to the
I Nationalist leader by the Associated

ture on the part of the British.
Ejection Looms
As Gandhi has made it known
previously that he will not accept
even unconditional liberty unless all
Congress members and political
prisoners are liberated with him, an
extremely embarrassing situation
| may confront the officials. If he
, definitely refuses to leave the prison,
it may be necessary for the local
officials to eject him.
Jailed Since May 5
The wizened little Hindu leader
has been in jail here since May 5
i under an old ordinance which per
mits the internment of anyone ad
judged a menace to the public order.

dred-mile march from Ahmebabad
to the Gulf of Cambay to break the
