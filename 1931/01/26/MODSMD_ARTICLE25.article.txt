# Hospital Service For University Beyond Finances
## Elaborate Health Program to Take Place of Building Schedule; Storey Declares Effectiveness of Medical Department Increased IMPORTANT ITEMS OF PROGRESS ARE STRESSED 
### 
STANFORD cannot afford to build an infirmary, a hospital, an isolation
unit, or a convalescent home similar to those provided by her more
fortunate sister universities. Such was the answer given yesterday by
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director of the School of Hygiene and Physical
Education and medical adviser for men, to questions regarding the
student health service asked last week by The Daily.

Finances Needed
Admitting the present inability of
the University to provide a 24-hour
a day student medical service, Dr.
Storey declared the organization,
program, and effectiveness of the
Stanford health service have in
creased enormously during the past
three years and will continue to
grow, especially if added financial
resources may be secured. He listed
the following as the more important
items of progress the University is
stressing in regard to the ultimate
Stanford health program:
1. At least one health examination
or health conference with every
student every year.
2. A habit and attitude that will
bring every student in trouble to
the Health Service promptly wheth
er his troubles be physical, emo
tional, or social, knowing that the
relationship will be personal and
private between him and a trusted
health adviser.
Plan Practical Service
3. A complete practical Univer
sity Health Service that will safe
guard the campus community from
disease carriers and communicable
diseases of all sorts.
4. A hospital arrangement that
will furnish an observation unit, iso
lation facilities, out-patient sei'vice,
complete hospitalization facilities,
and a convalescent unit, within the
financial means of the student.
Every registered student pays $5
a quarter for medical care. Dr.
Storey said the total income from
these fees last year, in round num
bers, was $57,200. Of this total
$28,000 was expended from the bud
get for hospitalization, medical fees,
and surgical fees; $23,700 for the
health budget for approximately
3,000 men, and $4,700 for the health
budget for 500 women.
Uses of $5 Fee
The $5 quarterly health fee, ac
cording to Dr. Storey, pays in part
for, or helps the University pay for:
(1) the hospitalization and medical
care of sick students; (2) the surgi
cal treatment and hospital care of
students in need of emergency
operations; (3) the Rest Home ser
vices for men and for women pro
vided by the Mothers' Club of Stan
ford University.
(4) The Isolation Hospital care of
all students with communicable dis
eases required to go into isolation
and quarantine by the laws of the
state; (5) the health examination
and advice of all new students en
tering Stanford University; (6) the
examination and advice of all stu
dents reporting voluntarily to the
Student Health Services for help
with their problems of physical,
emotional, or social health.
Office Treatment
(7) The examination and safe
guarded office treatment of all sick
students able to report to the Stu
dent Health Service offices for help;
(8) the examination of all candi
dates for athletic training and com
petition who wish to establish their
physical eligibility; (9) the examina
tion of all suspected carriers of
communicable disease.
(10) The health examination of all
candidates for teaching credentials,
who must be certified as to physical
and mental health in conformity
with the State law; (11) the ex
amination of all petitioners for
leaves of absence who present
health reasons for their petitions;
(12) the examination of students
whose poor records may be due
to health reasons.
(13) The bacteriological analysis
of campus drinking water and the
water of the swimming pools; (14)
the bacteriological examination of
milk for campus use; (15) the bac
teriological examination of throat
cultures and other cultures of sus
pected infections; (16) the sanita
tion inspection of the campus; (17)
the control of epidemics as well as
their prevention.
Work Valued at $22,864
On the basis of average fees
charged by private practitioners for
office visits and medical examina
tions, Dr. Storey evaluates the work
of the Men Students' Health Service
during the past quarter at $22,864.
Adding to this the monetary value
of the health insurance furnished the
student by nearby hospitals for the
autumn quarter (308 students for a
total of 1,453 days) amounting to
approximately SI 2,000, Dr. Storey
believes the total monetary value of
the combined health and hospital
services could be placed at $34,864
for the quarter just passed.
"This conservative estimate of
value received, declared Dr. Storey,
"does not include the value of the
University Health Service with its
preventive influence on the dis
semination of communicable disease
and the occurrence of epidemics,
nor does it include the value of the
work done by the Women Students'
Health Service under the direction
of Doctor Dyment."

bers, was $57,200. Of this total
$28,000 was expended from the bud
get for hospitalization, medical fees,
and surgical fees; $23,700 for the
health budget for approximately
3,000 men, and $4,700 for the health
budget for 500 women.
Uses of $5 Fee
The $5 quarterly health fee, ac
cording to Dr. Storey, pays in part
for, or helps the University pay for:
(1) the hospitalization and medical
care of sick students; (2) the surgi
cal treatment and hospital care of
students in need of emergency
operations; (3) the Rest Home ser
vices for men and for women pro
vided by the Mothers' Club of Stan
ford University.
(4) The Isolation Hospital care of
all students with communicable dis
eases required to go into isolation
and quarantine by the laws of the
state; (5) the health examination
and advice of all new students en
tering Stanford University; (6) the
examination and advice of all stu
dents reporting voluntarily to the
Student Health Services for help
with their problems of physical,
emotional, or social health.
Office Treatment
(7) The examination and safe
guarded office treatment of all sick
students able to report to the Stu
dent Health Service offices for help;
(8) the examination of all candi
dates for athletic training and com
petition who wish to establish their
physical eligibility; (9) the examina
tion of all suspected carriers of
communicable disease.
(10) The health examination of all
candidates for teaching credentials,
who must be certified as to physical
and mental health in conformity
with the State law; (11) the ex
amination of all petitioners for
leaves of absence who present
health reasons for their petitions;
(12) the examination of students
whose poor records may be due
to health reasons.
(13) The bacteriological analysis
of campus drinking water and the
water of the swimming pools; (14)
the bacteriological examination of
milk for campus use; (15) the bac
teriological examination of throat
cultures and other cultures of sus
pected infections; (16) the sanita
tion inspection of the campus; (17)
the control of epidemics as well as
their prevention.
Work Valued at $22,864
On the basis of average fees
charged by private practitioners for
office visits and medical examina
tions, Dr. Storey evaluates the work
of the Men Students' Health Service
during the past quarter at $22,864.
Adding to this the monetary value
of the health insurance furnished the
student by nearby hospitals for the
autumn quarter (308 students for a
total of 1,453 days) amounting to
approximately SI 2,000, Dr. Storey
believes the total monetary value of
the combined health and hospital
services could be placed at $34,864
for the quarter just passed.
"This conservative estimate of
value received, declared Dr. Storey,
"does not include the value of the
University Health Service with its
preventive influence on the dis
semination of communicable disease
and the occurrence of epidemics,
nor does it include the value of the
work done by the Women Students'
Health Service under the direction
of Doctor Dyment."
STANFORD cannot afford to build an infirmary, a hospital, an isolation
unit, or a convalescent home similar to those provided by her more
fortunate sister universities. Such was the answer given yesterday by
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director of the School of Hygiene and Physical
Education and medical adviser for men, to questions regarding the
student health service asked last week by The Daily.

Finances Needed
Admitting the present inability of
the University to provide a 24-hour
a day student medical service, Dr.
Storey declared the organization,
program, and effectiveness of the
Stanford health service have in
creased enormously during the past
three years and will continue to
grow, especially if added financial
resources may be secured. He listed
the following as the more important
items of progress the University is
stressing in regard to the ultimate
Stanford health program:
1. At least one health examination
or health conference with every
student every year.
2. A habit and attitude that will
bring every student in trouble to
the Health Service promptly wheth
er his troubles be physical, emo
tional, or social, knowing that the
relationship will be personal and
private between him and a trusted
health adviser.
Plan Practical Service
3. A complete practical Univer
sity Health Service that will safe
guard the campus community from
disease carriers and communicable
diseases of all sorts.
4. A hospital arrangement that
will furnish an observation unit, iso
lation facilities, out-patient sei'vice,
complete hospitalization facilities,
and a convalescent unit, within the
financial means of the student.
Every registered student pays $5
a quarter for medical care. Dr.

Work Valued at $22,864
On the basis of average fees
charged by private practitioners for
office visits and medical examina
tions, Dr. Storey evaluates the work
of the Men Students' Health Service
during the past quarter at $22,864.
Adding to this the monetary value
of the health insurance furnished the
student by nearby hospitals for the
autumn quarter (308 students for a
total of 1,453 days) amounting to
approximately SI 2,000, Dr. Storey
believes the total monetary value of
the combined health and hospital
services could be placed at $34,864
for the quarter just passed.
"This conservative estimate of
value received, declared Dr. Storey,
"does not include the value of the
University Health Service with its
preventive influence on the dis
semination of communicable disease
and the occurrence of epidemics,
nor does it include the value of the
work done by the Women Students'
Health Service under the direction
of Doctor Dyment."
STANFORD cannot afford to build an infirmary, a hospital, an isolation
unit, or a convalescent home similar to those provided by her more
fortunate sister universities. Such was the answer given yesterday by
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director of the School of Hygiene and Physical
Education and medical adviser for men, to questions regarding the
student health service asked last week by The Daily.

Finances Needed
Admitting the present inability of
the University to provide a 24-hour
a day student medical service, Dr.
Storey declared the organization,
program, and effectiveness of the
Stanford health service have in
creased enormously during the past
three years and will continue to
grow, especially if added financial
resources may be secured. He listed
the following as the more important
items of progress the University is
stressing in regard to the ultimate
Stanford health program:
1. At least one health examination
or health conference with every
student every year.
2. A habit and attitude that will
bring every student in trouble to
the Health Service promptly wheth
er his troubles be physical, emo
tional, or social, knowing that the
relationship will be personal and
private between him and a trusted
health adviser.
Plan Practical Service
3. A complete practical Univer
sity Health Service that will safe
guard the campus community from
disease carriers and communicable
diseases of all sorts.
4. A hospital arrangement that
will furnish an observation unit, iso
lation facilities, out-patient sei'vice,
complete hospitalization facilities,
and a convalescent unit, within the
financial means of the student.
Every registered student pays $5
a quarter for medical care. Dr.
Storey said the total income from
these fees last year, in round num
bers, was $57,200. Of this total
$28,000 was expended from the bud
get for hospitalization, medical fees,
and surgical fees; $23,700 for the
health budget for approximately
3,000 men, and $4,700 for the health
budget for 500 women.
Uses of $5 Fee
The $5 quarterly health fee, ac
cording to Dr. Storey, pays in part
for, or helps the University pay for:
(1) the hospitalization and medical
care of sick students; (2) the surgi
cal treatment and hospital care of
students in need of emergency
operations; (3) the Rest Home ser
vices for men and for women pro
vided by the Mothers' Club of Stan
ford University.
(4) The Isolation Hospital care of
all students with communicable dis
eases required to go into isolation
and quarantine by the laws of the
state; (5) the health examination
and advice of all new students en
tering Stanford University; (6) the
examination and advice of all stu
dents reporting voluntarily to the
Student Health Services for help
with their problems of physical,
emotional, or social health.
Office Treatment
(7) The examination and safe
guarded office treatment of all sick
students able to report to the Stu
dent Health Service offices for help;
(8) the examination of all candi
dates for athletic training and com
petition who wish to establish their
physical eligibility; (9) the examina
tion of all suspected carriers of
communicable disease.
(10) The health examination of all
candidates for teaching credentials,
who must be certified as to physical
and mental health in conformity
with the State law; (11) the ex
amination of all petitioners for
leaves of absence who present
health reasons for their petitions;
(12) the examination of students
whose poor records may be due
to health reasons.
(13) The bacteriological analysis
