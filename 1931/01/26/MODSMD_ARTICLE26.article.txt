## Authorities Place Emphasis On Liberal Study 
### 
WINTER PARK, Fla., Jan. 25. (/P) |
—Educational experts who attended |
the Rollins College Conference here 1
expressed the opinion that colleges of !
30 years hence will place more em- '
phasis on the cultural education of ;
each student as an individual.
Arthur E. Morgan, president of ;
Antioch College, and John Palmer j
Gavit, editor and journalist, agreed !
there already is a tendency to es- !
cape from present separation of ■
higher education into liberal arts :
and vocational schools and in the j
future colleges will stress cultural j
education of the individual.
Practicality Aim
Dr. Morgan's vision of the college
curricula of the future showed that
experience with practical life will j
be woven into the school program. |
Development of moral and social
purpose will be regarded as no less ;
important than intelligent develop- 1
ment.
Mr. Gavit said there wei'e two !
forces at work in higher education.
One is propelled under impulse of ,
the vast development of machinery I
and mass production which tends i
toward standardization of the stu
dent as a product. The other ten
dency is that represented by pro- j
gressivc schools, which he pointed
out "is equally bad when it is car
ried to such extremes as building
curriculum upon first whims and j
adolescent interests of students."
Individual Tendency
The kind of education Gavit be- '
Sieved was needed and toward which |
he thought there is a strong ten
dency which will lead to a new i
conception of college is founded on i
the premise that the individual stu
dent is the all-important unit.
"There is need for colleges," he
said, "which shall give cultural edu
cation without reference to research i
or special professions." He said he i
believed the primary purpose of the 1
university should be research and I
the primary function of the small s
liberal arts college should be teach- j
ing.
