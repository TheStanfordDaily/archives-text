# STANFORD'S LUCKY FIFTEENTH
## 
### 
Stanford 37, California 32!
Another fighting Stanford team, following the precedent set so
many times before In other fighting Stanford teams, returned from
I'erkeley Saturday night proudly bearing the axe-hewn scalp of
the once-proud ( Jolden Dear.
Stanford has collected California scalps with regularity each
vear for victories in football and track, lint this latest Indian raid
merits special recognition, since the medium of battle was basket
ball: and Stanford won. Saturday's win, coming as it did after 14
straight defeats on the court, was particularly sweet to supporters
of the Red.
If Stanford fails to win another game this year, it will still be
a banner season. The tide has turned. The odds have changed.
California's six-year basketball supremacy has been checked, it
still will be a successful season if the Indians lose every other game,
but Coach John I hum and his men have no idea of abruptly ter
minating their winning streak. The Stanford team is now a win
ning team, and its supporters may look forward to continued suc
cess.
The basketball schedule carries no '"breather" games. Another
crucial contest will be played next Saturday night when the league
leading I'.C.L.A. Ilrnins meet Stanford in the local pavilion. Al
though Coach I'unn harbors no championship aspirations this year,
a victorv over the Bruins would give the Indians a chance to tie
for conference honors.
Stanford basketball is definitely on the upgrade. As the Stan
ford team has improved, undergraduate support and enthusiasm
has increased. Continued support of basketball by the student body
should do much to assure continued victories.
