()ne more discovery in the X-ray field lias been made by a visit
ing scientist who recently announced the development of the fluo
rescent X-ray photometer, designed to measure the intensity of
radiation.
The use of X-rays in medicine lias been limited becausc of the
intense and dangerous radiation produced by the rays. It is used
in varving ways; to burn cancerous tissues and to reveal foreign
objects in the otherwise impenetrable human body.
With the photometer, medical science will be able to use the
X-ray freely and with little fear of injury. This latest contribution
to the practical task of alleviating human suffering is indicative ol
the trend of Stanford research.
