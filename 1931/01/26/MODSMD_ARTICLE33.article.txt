# WHY WE BUY BOOKS
## 
### 
Many students complain at the seemingly unnecessary changing I
of textbooks at Oregon State. That other colleges have the same
complaint is evidenced In a committee appointed at the University
of Washington to investigate the reasons for changing texts.
The committee after a research into the question reported nine
reasons submitted by faculty members for requiring new books.
1. Current changes in material in the courses.
1. Changes in courses from upper division to lower division.
3. Notations by students, answering the questions in the book.
4. Average life of textbook not more than two years.
5. Changes and segregations in courses.
h. New and better textbooks should be used when available. â€”
