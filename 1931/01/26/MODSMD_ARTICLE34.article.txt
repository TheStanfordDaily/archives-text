DANCING BEAUTIES—At the Var
sity Theatre.
"Dancing Beauties" is a Cinderella
| sexess story with Sue Carroll as
j ingenue, and Grant Withers as the
I man who came back to her.
i We use the word "Cinderella" to
I indicate the flavor of "Dancing
I Beauties." There is no fairy prince.
| Grant Withers is a drug store cow-
I boy instead.
But Sue's two ugly sisters and the
j author's utter disregard for dramatic
i continuity stamp this picture as un
j mistakable romance of the best
| Hollywood variety.
We are not trying to be facetious,
j The picture has no unwarranted
j pretentions. The dancing is excel
| lent. The music is agreeable. Sue
('Carroll is good to look at.
j Even if Sue and Withers are mar
j lied without the convenience of a
! license, and a few other such un
! necessary complications are blithely
' ignored, the picture is entertaining.
There is a rah-rah college comedy
i that would be entirely inexcusable
! were it not for a mad driving epi
sode. —B. P.

Although there is one "story of
| 1930". outstanding in the collection,
I the "O. Henry Prize Stories" pre
i sent as a whole an unusually good
j general collection.
In consideration of style and poetic
' beauty, Elizabeth M. Robert's
j "Sacrifice of the Maidehs" is by far
! the best. Using almost no action,
| she achieves a fine study of charac
| ter and pathos. Yet there is no doubt
; that the committee was justified in

choosing W. R. Burnett's "Dressing
' Up" and W. M. John's "Neither Jew
Nor Greek" for first prize. The first
!is one of those things—a "perfect
j short story." Plot, character, words,
and action are well balanced. The
j second has less realism but more
human feeling.
Notable for its ruthless progres
! sion, Irwin S. Cobb's "Faith, Hope,
. and Charity" tells of three escaped
| convicts who, in a weird and fatalis
: tic manner meet fates similar to
I those they had escaped in prison.

GERMAN GRAND OPERA — "Die
j Walkuere" by the German Grand
Opera Company at the Civic Audi
torium. with Johanna Gadski,
Marie von Essen, Max Roth, and
Johannes Sembach.
| A second-rate opera company
! settled itself for five days in the
i Civic Auditorium and as proof of
j its mediocrity, at its very open
ing last Saturday evening, gave "Die
Walkuere."
The classic test of the production
as such lies in the presentation of
j the first and second acts, with its
many dreary stretches to the hearer
—the third act, with its spectacular
flame scene and magnificent music
even Gadski and Roth couldn't spoil.
The singers did not come up to
the standards set by a Metropolitan
! company. Only the orchestra with
| the eminent Berlin conductor, Max
| von Schilling as leader, made the
first part of the opera tolerable. If
one had waited until the latter part
of the third act and then walked in
gratis, one might have heard all worth
hearing, as well as saved time and
money for something really worth
while, like the coming of the Chi
cago Civic Opera Company in March.

Marie von Essen, Max Roth, and
Johannes Sembach.
| A second-rate opera company
! settled itself for five days in the
i Civic Auditorium and as proof of
j its mediocrity, at its very open
ing last Saturday evening, gave "Die
Walkuere."
The classic test of the production
as such lies in the presentation of
j the first and second acts, with its
many dreary stretches to the hearer
—the third act, with its spectacular
flame scene and magnificent music
even Gadski and Roth couldn't spoil.
The singers did not come up to
the standards set by a Metropolitan
! company. Only the orchestra with
| the eminent Berlin conductor, Max
| von Schilling as leader, made the
first part of the opera tolerable. If
one had waited until the latter part
of the third act and then walked in
gratis, one might have heard all worth
hearing, as well as saved time and
money for something really worth
while, like the coming of the Chi
cago Civic Opera Company in March.

DANCING BEAUTIES—At the Var
sity Theatre.
"Dancing Beauties" is a Cinderella
| sexess story with Sue Carroll as
j ingenue, and Grant Withers as the
I man who came back to her.
i We use the word "Cinderella" to
I indicate the flavor of "Dancing
I Beauties." There is no fairy prince.
| Grant Withers is a drug store cow-
I boy instead.
But Sue's two ugly sisters and the
j author's utter disregard for dramatic
i continuity stamp this picture as un
j mistakable romance of the best
| Hollywood variety.
We are not trying to be facetious,
j The picture has no unwarranted
j pretentions. The dancing is excel
| lent. The music is agreeable. Sue
('Carroll is good to look at.
j Even if Sue and Withers are mar
j lied without the convenience of a
! license, and a few other such un
! necessary complications are blithely
' ignored, the picture is entertaining.
There is a rah-rah college comedy
i that would be entirely inexcusable
! were it not for a mad driving epi
sode. —B. P.

Although there is one "story of

j general collection.
In consideration of style and poetic
' beauty, Elizabeth M. Robert's
j "Sacrifice of the Maidehs" is by far
! the best. Using almost no action,
| she achieves a fine study of charac
| ter and pathos. Yet there is no doubt
; that the committee was justified in

choosing W. R. Burnett's "Dressing
' Up" and W. M. John's "Neither Jew
Nor Greek" for first prize. The first
!is one of those things—a "perfect
j short story." Plot, character, words,
and action are well balanced. The
j second has less realism but more
human feeling.
Notable for its ruthless progres
! sion, Irwin S. Cobb's "Faith, Hope,

| convicts who, in a weird and fatalis

I those they had escaped in prison.
