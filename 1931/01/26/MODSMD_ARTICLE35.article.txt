## INSULTING REQUIREMENTS? 
### 
j The Editor, Sir:
The four original recommendations !
| ol' the Executive Committee
| trimmed to two, through the wis
dom of members of the faculty. But, I
j though the more manifestly absurd I
of the proposals were dropped, the |
remaining items are by no means
acceptable.
* They are: (1) "That no written ;
work to be used as a basis for grades j
be corrected unless there be api
pended a personally written and |
signed pledge, as follows: 'I hereby
certify on my honor that I have
neither given nor received .aid .in 1
this test (report or examination).'"!
And (2) "That all faculty members |
| be requested to remind their classes j
, before each examination, quiz, or !
i report assignment that the Honor j
Code is an institution at Stanford j
and that students are expected to
conduct themselves accordingly by j
doing their work unaided, and by |
giving no help to others."
To consider first the*second.pro
posal: The situation at present is j
that any instructor may addresss his
| class in such a fashion if he wishes;
i and in case good taste and expe- j
| diency permit it, he will likely do i
; so. I have heard and known of a j
number of such speeches during my
I college career. But it is a serious and j
! pernicious piece of interference in j
j classroom conduct to require each !
j instructor to insult his students be- j
I fore every examination. I imagine i
| that if this proposal were put into j
j effect, most of the faculty would re- j
| fuse to obey it, and the others would j
j accompany their orations with apol
j ogy. As to the probable effect of >
j such procedure, I believe it would !
j defeat its own ends by arousing an- j
i tognism and resentment. If it is :
presumed that students are by na- I
ture dishonest, and in requirement !
of constant reminders, they will i
probably do their best to fill the bill. !
The first proposal, as it applies to |
| examinations, would have no more j
and n6 less effect than such an i
artificial measure might be expected !
! to have. The effect might be slightly ;
] good, due to the respect a man holds !
| for his signature, or it might be j
rather bad, through arousing an- j
tugonism. I, personally, would re- !
gard such a requirement as insult- !
ing.
But as it applies to papers and i

I reports, the first proposal makes a
I more serious error than merely that
of misunderstanding the basis of the
'I Honor Code. It misconstrues the one
j basic purpose of the University. We
j-are here for the purpose, and only
j for the purpose, of i-eceiving aid
from the faculty and our fellow stu
dents. It would be impossible for a
| conscientious student to write a
; paper and sign a pledge that he had
| not. received aid in its construction,
j It may be said that the pledge is
| intended to apply only to aid that
j is subversive to education. But such
distinctions cannot be made by arti
i ficial pledges, resolutions, or laws.
| They can be made only by the in
j dividual judgment of an honorable
I man.
This is a fundamental reason for
j preferring a true honor system to
; the proctor system or such a com
promise with the proctor system as
j we now have. â€”Jim Tucker.
