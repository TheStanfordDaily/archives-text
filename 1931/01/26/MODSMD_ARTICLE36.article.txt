# "INTENT TO DECEIVE"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The proposal that tests and re
ports should be followed by an
honor pledge, "I certify that I have
neither given nor received aid," may
or may not be wise. In either case
it is ambiguous and misleading.
There are many situations in which
students obtain aid in a perfectly
honorable way and without any in
tent to deceive; for instance, the
reading of other students' notes, the
discussion of bibliographies, general
criticism, and suggestions. As ap
plied to tests, the wording of the
pledge is accurate enough, but as
applied to written reports it brands
as dishonorable every sort of inno
cent and helpful co-operation.
This ambiguity is not only con
fusing, but dangerous. Innocent co
operation will continue In spite of
it, of course; but breaking of the
letter of the law will make breaking
its spirit just that much easier. By
association with innocent things, the
concept of dishonor, in students'
minds, will tend to become diluted
and indistinct. The essential point,
certainly, is whether or not the stu
dent attempts to obtain undeserved
crcdit by dcceit. I suggest, there
fore. that the pledge be reworded
by the simple addition of the words
"with intent to deceive." It would
then x - ead, "I hereby certify on my
honor that I have neither given nor
received aid, with intent to deceive,
in this test( report or examination)."
