# CABBAGES and Things..

; For the first time in six years we
! chortled with glee at our California
! friends, after the basketball game
; Saturday night. After all, baseball
j season hasn't opened yet, and maybe
j they can shine there this year . . .
i Of course, we doubt it.
| If someone had charged us with
{assault and battery, at the game, we
! couldn't have denied it. The alum
I sitting next to us got so excited
j that he filled his pipe with broken
| peanut shells, and started to smoke
! it. Try that when your room-mate's
j around, some day, and observe his
i reaction (The scientific spirit, at all
i costs!).
Wonder if their awful new jerseys
i had anything to do with the team's
j success? They are said to strongly
. resemble the swimming' suits worn
: in Roble gym by the five-hundred
; athletes. If they're too much alike,
I we'd better go back to the old red
| and-white suits. We certainly can't
! afford to confuse the two brands.
At last! The secret of why some
j girls are popular, and some just
! collitch girls trying to get along. The
I dean of women at one of our better
known colleges makes a plea to the
girls of that institution to "give an
; old-fashioned scrubbing, daily, to
; the backs of their necks. Hundreds
jof attractive girls diminish their
| beauty by carelessness regarding
I neck washing. ' Well ....
And now a report comes from the
! national capitol that President
! Hoover was suffering a severe case
I of indigestion, yesterday. He prob
i ably sent for the Secretary of the
i Interior to relieve him?
Results of the rushing season just
1 past appear more appalling each
j time we think of them. We're re
minded of an old, old song we used
to hear people sing, before the days
j of prohibition:
49 DG's standing in a Row,
l 49 DG : s, wondering where to go.
One of 'em went crazy,
But the others were too slow;
That leaves 48 DG's standing in a
Row.
