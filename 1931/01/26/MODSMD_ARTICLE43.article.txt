### Abe Mellinkoff 
Dartmouth placed itself in a fast
1 gx-bwing class of schools. First by
being beaten by a Stanford football
i team and second by abolishing haz
j ing.
Hazing was one of those things
abotit which each sophomore class
used to say, "We are against it; but
j if we went through it, these frosh
j can, too."
Some women at the University of
Nebraska feel that living in a dormi
tory decreases their individuality.
Too many co-eds today feel
that individuality is expressed in
the latest Paris creations, by
driving red roadsters, and living
the heroine's part.
The Stanford rough may be rough,
I but he is being outdone by the Hus
' kies at the University of Washing
! ton who have just completed a 30-
| day beard-growing contest.
The furry growth on and about
j the chin keeps the cold wind of!
the Adam's apple, is a wondei'ful
■ place to hide notes during examina
! tions, and surely cuts down the
| shaving bill.
Michigan State College will

offer a course in hotel manage
ment. The big problem in run
ning hotels is keeping the water
cold in summer and the heaters
hot in winter.

Harvard, the pride of Amer
ica and the hope of Vassar. has
been forced to have guards at
all exits to the library to insure
that industrious students do not
make oIT with university hooks,
j The Stanford Library misses books
at times but most of them come
back when they are no longer being
' used by the classroom —just in time
I to be too late for the worried stu-
I dent.
