Once upon a time .a simple street
sweeper inherited one million
smacks. Unaccustomed as he was
to the public gaze, it took him less
ime it takes to tell this to shed his
wealth, and so shortly he was back
sweeping streets again.
Moral: Keep your feet 011 the
floor when Fortune smiles, and
it v, iii not he so far to fail if
you slip. Or, in plainer words,
once a winning team does not
mean always a winning team.
After 14 straight lickings, Stanford
came to and grabbed a victory Sat
urday at the expense of Nibs Price
and his California Bears. And as the
general public is now i*emarking,
"Can't those boys .from Stanford
leave that guy Price alone?"
It would appear from the nu
merous flashlight powders ex
ploded in the Oakland Audi
torium that it was a convention
•if photographers and not a bas
ketball game that had attracted
the crowd. Evidently California
has its "Stinky" Davis's too.
With the triumph over U.C., Stan
ford climbed from the cellar posi
tion in the Pacific Coast Conference
Cage circle. But it is still a long
road that the Indians must tread
before they can hold their heads
erect.
Having lost the first game by
a fairly close margin, California
will invade the Farm for the?
seeojid epic in no sweet frame
of mind. Out to capture the Con- '
ference crown, the Blue and
Cold must take the series from
Stanford or fail in their quest.
And it will be a tougher bunch of
Californians to beat a second time.
Not only have the Bears learned a
lot from the first tilt, but their men
tal attitude will be vastly different.
Last Saturday night it was a confi
dent band of Bears, next time it will
be a fighting team.
After years of combat, it is a
relief to see the Stanford eager
sing his free throws. Captain
Mike Reynolds was a fair-haired
boy 011 the foul line, getting
eight out of twelve attempts.
California sunk but four of her
ten foul shots.
Most gratifying to the Indians was
the clean game Stanford played. But
ten fouls were called on the Red
shirts, and none of Bunn's boys had
more than two chalked up against
them. But 24 fouls were called on
both teams, which is not bad for a
California-Stanford game, nor did
the officials miss any noticeable
miscues. —L. K., Jr.
