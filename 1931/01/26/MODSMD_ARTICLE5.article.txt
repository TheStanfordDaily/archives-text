# INDIAN ROOTERS GLOAT OVER WIN
## Feeling Runs High During Varsity Clash 
### 
i The long lane came to its turning
• I on Saturday night, and a giant Cali
, fornia crowd sat sullenly in its seats
; trying to digest the unpleasant reali
-1 zation that the Golden Bear had j
. been knocked spinning off the high i
[ road to victory and in the future j
■ would have to fight for his share of j
: the highway with a Stanford Indian. |
i On the other side of the smoke
| filled pavilion the small but select
t ; Stanford rooting section made the
t most of the long awaited occasion in
1 raucous gloating.
, | Feeling, running high all evening,
flared sharply during the freshman j
contest as a Bear Cub hoopster took [
! a punch at one of the yearling In
dians. The cheering from the Stan
ford section was scattered and des
ultory at the close of the prelimi
nary.
Crowd Cheers Fast Start
And then the varsity clash. Rin- :
tala from far out, Reynolds a free j
throw, Moffatt a looping one-handed
shot, and Reynolds a cripple under
1 the basket. Seven to nothing, and
! behind the press box the Cardinal
war-cry blared madly out, to fade
1 away disappointedly as the Blue and j
Gold quintet, unable to miss, wiped
out the lead faster than it had piled |
' . up.
But the Indians did not fade. Four i
| points behind, they matched the j
Beai's basket for basket throughout
! the remainder of the half in a te
! nacious uphill battle. "If we get the
I first field goal to start the second
half we'll win," a Stanford rooter
whispered hoarsely.
Reynolds Connects
They got it—Reynolds going under
i the basket in a hurry. But it v/as
not until they had taken a 24-21
I lead with ten minutes left to play j
that the Indian rooters suddenly j
realized that there was better than j
I an even chance to actually win the j
game.
Almost as quickly as the realiza- j
tion came, it was consumed in the I
1 flame of the Bears' final desperate |
rally. At 28 all, Rintala made it vir- |
tually certain with the longest shot i
of the evening, only to have Davis
drop one at full tilt 30 seconds be
fore the closing whistle.
Davis Gives Lead
Then California rising to the man
as Davis sent the Bears into an
j overtime period lead with a flip
I shot from the corner. A stunned
1 silence on the Stanford side was
broken by a roar as Cordry darted
i into the hole for a basket, a roar i
; that gathered volume as Cordry j
again counted from the side, and i
burst in a mad crescendo at the final
j gun as Moffatt, alone under the bas- I
ket, reached calmly up and broke
the Bear's back with a cripple shot. !
37-32, and two to go. If we know
the Bear, he'll show his teeth the
next time.
