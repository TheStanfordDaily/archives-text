## EIFFERT STARS US CUB CAGERS TAKE DECISIVE VICTORY Stanford Quintet Stages Rally In Last Period; Smith Plays Well 
### Lowell Cox 
Taking advantage of every Stan
ford miscue, a smoothly working
University of California freshman j
quintet trounced the Indian frosh, I
39 to 22, in the preliminary to the ■
varsity game at Oakland Saturday i
night.
Led by Eifert, brilliant forward i
and captain, the Bear yearlings were I
complete masters of the situation by I
the middle of the first period.
After Packard opened the game j
with a field goal to put the Papoose ;
five in front momentarily, a free !
throw and a field goal put the j
Berkeley five in the lead, and they j
were never again headed. The first !
half ended with the Indian babes on !
the short end of a2oto 8 count. j
Papooses Stage Rally
Coach John Bunn accomplished
wonders between halves, for the
Papoose quintet returned to the
floor in the second period to battle j
the Bear Cubs on exten terms.
In a rally led by Packard, Topping, j
and Smith, the Stanford babes out- j
scored the Cubs in the second half, '
14 to 11, until Eifert ran wild in the j
closing minutes to score three field ;
goals in rapid succession. ,
Eifert Cub Star
Eifert lived up to his advance i
publicity, breaking up many Fapoose j
plays single-handed. He accounted
for 22 tallies, as many as the Indian j
babes scored altogether.
Coughlin was another Cub who >
consistently made trouble for the
Stanford yearlings, until he was
ejected from the game in the second ;
half after lie slugged Topping.
Smith Stands Out
For Stanford, Smith was the most
consistent player on the floor. This
flashy little guard was cool-headed
at all times, made few mistakes, and ;
exhibited more scrap than the rest !
of the team put together. In spite of !
the fact that he is a guard, he con- I
tributed seven points to the Stanford |
total, trailing only Topping for high- !
point honors.
Topping, with nine tallies, played
a good game until unnerved by the j
tiff with Coughlin. He was an inte- i
gral cog in the second half rally. j

wonders between halves, for the
Papoose quintet returned to the
floor in the second period to battle j
the Bear Cubs on exten terms.
In a rally led by Packard, Topping, j
and Smith, the Stanford babes out- j
scored the Cubs in the second half, '
14 to 11, until Eifert ran wild in the j
closing minutes to score three field ;
goals in rapid succession. ,
Eifert Cub Star
Eifert lived up to his advance i
publicity, breaking up many Fapoose j
plays single-handed. He accounted
for 22 tallies, as many as the Indian j
babes scored altogether.
Coughlin was another Cub who >
consistently made trouble for the
Stanford yearlings, until he was
ejected from the game in the second ;
half after lie slugged Topping.
Smith Stands Out
For Stanford, Smith was the most
consistent player on the floor. This
flashy little guard was cool-headed
at all times, made few mistakes, and ;
exhibited more scrap than the rest !
of the team put together. In spite of !
the fact that he is a guard, he con- I
tributed seven points to the Stanford |
total, trailing only Topping for high- !
point honors.
Topping, with nine tallies, played
a good game until unnerved by the j
tiff with Coughlin. He was an inte- i
gral cog in the second half rally. j
