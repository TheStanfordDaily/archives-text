### Mike Crofoot 
Sequoia Hall I is no longer the
top-heavy favorite to win the 1931
intramural basketball title.
Displaying impressive teamwork
and sevex*al stars of first magnitude
in their initial game against Delta
Chi, Sigma Chi. 1930 champions,
' served notice that they would be
1 very much in the running for this
year's- title, thus providing the out
standing development of the second
week's play in the annual intra
mural tournament.
Stars on Each Team
Sequoia I won its opener from
Encina V, 38-5; Sigma Chi beat
Delta Chi, 35-10. Harrisan, right for
, ward for the hall men, tossed in 14
points in the former game; Gold
water, Sigma Chi forward, got 20 in
the latter. Getts, smooth-working,
experienced center, and Hunnicutt,
! former all-conference guard for
Whittier College, both of Sequoia,
are matched by Sigma Chi's big
center, Ed Elliot, and brilliant guard,
Joujon-Roche.
i All around ability of Palmberg,
Sequoia's left forward, and the trick
knee of Roche give the hall men a
little the better of the man-for-man
comparison. Because both teams
! must win premier honors in their
leagues, before they meet, a struggle
between them may not take place,
I but from their showing to date one
; of the two is going to be crowned
champion.
