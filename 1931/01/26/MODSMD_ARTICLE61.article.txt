# GLEDHILL WINS TOURNEY FINAL FOR NET TITLE
## Win Over Easton Reveals Highlights Of Stellar Tennis Playing 
### 
Keith Gledhill is still the tennis j
champion of Stanford.
By defeating Ted Easton 6-4,
! 13-11, in a struggle abounding in all :
! the highlights of stellar tennis, Gled
| hill last Friday once more proved
! himself beyond a doubt the undis- ;
puted king of the local courts. '
Players Off Game
Both players, Gledhill especially,
1 were decidedly off thoii 4 service
| game, but Easton's drives were
I working to perfection, his brilliant
I placements oftentimes proving dead
| ly. Time and again each lost his own
I serve in the first set, but the score
, card soon began to tell a different
j story. Tightening up in the second
set, they fought a terrific give-and- j
! take battle until Gledhill finally
pulled through with the winning
push to cinch the match at 13-11.
This is the second time Easton has
j been on the short end of a score
j with Gledhill in less than a week,
ihe and Chuck Weesner having
; dropped the doubles championship
to Gledhill and Joe Coughlin last
Tuesday.
Phil Niederauer turned in a big
I surprise by trouncing Chuck Wees
ner 6-0, 6-1, thereby upsetting the
| fifth man and jumping into that po- .
j sition himself. This puts him within I
striking distance of the four "big"
: boys, which means he is entitled to
| a shot at either Joe Coughlin or ,
Harry Plymire in the near future.
The only other varsity ranking
match placed George Bergstrom in
i George Forney's position by a score j
j of 6-1, 12-10, 6-2.
Otis Keeps Laurels
Chuck Otis and Monte Shwayder
staged a contest Friday, as a result
| of which Otis still wears the fresh- i
' man laurels, winning the match
' rather easily by 6-3, 6-1. Shwayder, ;
consequently, must play Dan Ellis
in defense of his second-place posi
tion.
Several freshman ranking matches
were settled over the week-end.

! 13-11, in a struggle abounding in all :
! the highlights of stellar tennis, Gled
| hill last Friday once more proved
! himself beyond a doubt the undis- ;
puted king of the local courts. '
Players Off Game
Both players, Gledhill especially,
1 were decidedly off thoii 4 service
| game, but Easton's drives were
I working to perfection, his brilliant
I placements oftentimes proving dead
| ly. Time and again each lost his own
I serve in the first set, but the score
, card soon began to tell a different
j story. Tightening up in the second
set, they fought a terrific give-and- j
! take battle until Gledhill finally
pulled through with the winning
push to cinch the match at 13-11.
This is the second time Easton has
j been on the short end of a score
j with Gledhill in less than a week,
ihe and Chuck Weesner having
; dropped the doubles championship
to Gledhill and Joe Coughlin last
Tuesday.
Phil Niederauer turned in a big
I surprise by trouncing Chuck Wees
ner 6-0, 6-1, thereby upsetting the
| fifth man and jumping into that po- .
j sition himself. This puts him within I
striking distance of the four "big"
: boys, which means he is entitled to
| a shot at either Joe Coughlin or ,
Harry Plymire in the near future.
The only other varsity ranking
match placed George Bergstrom in
i George Forney's position by a score j
j of 6-1, 12-10, 6-2.
Otis Keeps Laurels
Chuck Otis and Monte Shwayder
staged a contest Friday, as a result
| of which Otis still wears the fresh- i
' man laurels, winning the match
' rather easily by 6-3, 6-1. Shwayder, ;
consequently, must play Dan Ellis
in defense of his second-place posi
tion.
Several freshman ranking matches
were settled over the week-end.

• Thorpe for sixth place in a 3-6, 6-1,
6-4 struggle, Joe Melczer won over
