# LEONARD POCKMAN WINS EIGHT TILTS IN FOIL PRACTICE
## Last Year's Frosh Fencing Captain Continues To Hold First Place 
### 
In the first inter-team, varsity
fencing matches held at the last
; regular practice session Leonard
pockman, last year's frosh captain,
; defeated eight men to win the event.
This contest was one of a series
that are held during the regular
: workouts so that the squad can get
regular competitive practice before
the actual intercollegiate meets start.
The bouts were one touch affairs,
! and were run off in the form of
; straight elimination matches. Pock
i man, in winning, was forced to de
-1 feat six men in succession. In doing
j this he displayed a knowledge of
swordsmanship that should make
i him a feraed opponent in the com-
I ing .events.
1 These one touch contests are only
' being held for the benefit of the
| practice the team gets from them,
| and not to rate the men on the
i squad.
Head Fencing Coach Maloney
supervised the bouts. Coach Ma
i loney and Asistant Instructor Elwyn
Bugge started the affair with a
closely contested bout. Both men
j showed great skill with the foils.
