# PRESIDENTIAL YACHT SWEPT BY FLAMES
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 25 (/P). â€”
The former presidential yacht May
flower, on whjjse decks have walked
many world figures of her day, lay
today fire-scarred and sunk in more
than thirty feet of water at the
Philadelphia Navy Yard.
The once proud presidential yacht
was swept by fire last night. Tons
of water were poured into the ship
until she settled-on the river bot
tom at her dock.
