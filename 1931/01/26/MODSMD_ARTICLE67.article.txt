# THOMAS EDISON'S LIFELONG HELPER LIES NEAR DEATH
## Meadowcroft, Biographer And Friend For Fifty Years, Very III 
### 
BOONTON, N.J., Jan. 25 (/P).--A
man who for half a century has sub
merged his own scientific genius in
his devotion to Thomas A. Edison,
lies seriously ill tonight.
A short, white-haired man with a
slight Eglish accent, William H.
Meadowcroft has reached his seven
ty - eighth year. For nearly fifty
years of his life, he has been called
a Boswell and even more to the in
ventive genius of the age and until
he was taken down with grippe two
weeks ago was engaged in his "spare
time" in compiling a detailed chron
icle of Edison's works.
Friends Since 1881
To Meadowcroft. Edison is "the
old man." The intimacy which such
a designation conjures has been in
the making since 1881.
Fame came to him with his de
velopment of the first electric dis
play signs. He toyed with little
square lamps and there evolved the
beginning of a new phase of adver
tising. Later came experiments with
the X-ray and with liquid air.
From the beginning there was a
strong tie between the two men, and
in 1910 Meadowcroft became confi
dential secretary and assistant to Mr.
Edison. â€¢
Leaving New York because he
grew fond of this hilly north Jersey
village, Meadowcroft for two score
years has driven daily into West
Orange to the Edison laboratories,
taking up his place in a little office
just a few steps from"the old man."
For a while, Meadowcroft ceases
to be Edison's Boswell. He becomes
Edison's diplomat, answering pa
tiently even the most trying letters.
His decision determines who shall
see Edison and for how long.
For years now, "the old man" has
been deaf. But there is little change
in the method of his conversing with
Meadowcroft. His assistant may pro
nounce words a little more articu
lately, but there is seldom the need
of writing what has to be said. Here
are two men who really know each
other.
