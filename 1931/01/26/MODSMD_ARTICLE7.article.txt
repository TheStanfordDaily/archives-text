# TROUBLE LOOMS FOR PRESIDENT
## Extra Session Threatened; Congress Hostile 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25. (JP) —
Triple trouble for President Hoover
prohibition, emergency food fund,
j and cash bonus—will continue to 1
j boil in the caldron of Congress this
I week.
! And more trouble looms larger
! with each passing legislative day
1 that brings an extra session nearer.
For Congress has only 33 working j
days until March 4, and not a single ;
supply bill has reached the Presi- i
dent for approval.
Extra Session Seen
] Administration leaders may strain
I at the collar to drag the legislative
; load over the finish line before time i
expires, but either they or the
President have provided the balky
ones with ample reason to hold back
on the breeching and a "big stick"
| won't budge them.
A tactical error has been scored
against the administration leaders in i
the Senate for making the Howell |
"Home Raid" bill the unfinished i
business of that body, largely be
cause this was done coincidentally i
with the issuance of the Wickersham
report.
Prohibition Dispute
All this week, and probably for
several weeks to come, the Howell
bill will be used as a spring board
to launch attack on the President's
position on prohibition. This was
evident today when Senator Wheeler
of Montana issued a statement
through the Democratic National
Committee.
"Will the country be kept in !
anxiety fof another fifteen or six
teen months until the next Repub
lican National Convention to know
where Hoover stands on this im
portant and controversial subject?" !
asked Wheeler, in his statement
which was obviously an organization
effort to "smoke out" the President.
