# ARKANSAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR EXPECTED FLOODS
## Drought Sufferers Busy Improving Grounds And Drainage Areas 
### 
I MARKED TREE, Ark., Jan. 25. </P)
J —Drought sufferers being fed by the
Red Cross here are cleaning drain
! age districts to get ready for the
j next flood.
The flood may not come this
spring. But again it may.
Before last summer's record
j breaking drought, now causing a
! growing amount of distress in Ar
kansas and other states of the South
■ and Southwest, three floods came in
rapid succession here.
Section Hard-Hit
That's one reason Poinsett County
, is one of the hardest hit in the state.
When the Mississippi goes on a
| spree, southeast Missouri empties a
j large part of its flood waters down
on this section. And the Red Cross
! has to go to work again feeding the
j farm tenants —the "share croppers,"
1 whites and negroes alike.
Many Tasks Begun
So they're cleaning out the drain
j age districts, but that is only one of
: the jobs being done by the destitute
j farm tenants.
Trees are being planted along the
; highways. Schoolyards are being
I cleaned up. Other public buildings
I and grounds are being improved.
To get the $2 weekly per couple,-
plus fifty cents additional for each
child, up to a total of $4.50, the able
bodied men have to work at least
I two days a week.
