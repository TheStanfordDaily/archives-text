Does reading in bed hurt
your eyes? It shouldn't.
Enough light over your
shoulder, no cramped posi
tion, your book held at proper
reading distance—and the bed
can be your "library".
If reading in bed isn't com
fortable for your eyes, if it tires
you—your eyes need care. You
may need glasses. It's easy to
make sure your eyes are right.
Let us examine them for you.
