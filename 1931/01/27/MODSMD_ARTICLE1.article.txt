# GANDHI LEAVES CELL TO MEET WITH LEADERS
## Indian Prophet Taken To Bombay To Discuss National Policy WANTS ABSOLUTE RULE 
### 
POONA, India, Jan. 26. (/P) â€”
Mahatma Gandhi, the little man
whom India's 320,000,000 regard as
the prophet of tho New Freedom,
tonight was taken out of the prison
where he had spent almost nine
months, and placed on a train for
Bombay, where he will talk over
with the rest of the Nationalist
leaders the political problems with
which both India and Britain are
deeply concerned.
Just before midnight he left the
prison by the back door. The prison
authorities helped him into an auto
mobile and the car raced through
the night along close-guarded roads
to a railway station about ten. miles
away. The train was due in Bombay
at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Crowds Await Idol
All day and all night a great
crowd,of Gandhi's disciples had sat
about the front gates of the prison
hoping for a glimpse of the national
idol, but no one knew when he was
to be released and the departure in
the night was witnessed by only a
handful of persons.
Just before he left Gandhi gave
the prison superintendent a note in
which he thanked the authorities for
their courteous treatment during his
incarceration.
Tells Indian's Desire
It was in fact more an intern
ment than an imprisonment, for
since last May when Gandhi was
arrested for making salt in defiance
of the British law he had been
quartered in a suite looking upon
the prison garden. He was treated
with great consideration.
"Nothing short of unequivocal
home rule will satisfy India's op
pressed masses," he said, at that,
time. Since Ramsay Mac Donald's
pronouncement of policy he has
made no statement regarding the
present situation in India.
