# SEQUOIA, CLUB HOOP QUINTETS IN MURAL WINS!
## Toro Beats S.A.E.; Campo Trims Encina 5; Theta Chi Bows To Hall 
### Francis Hamilton 
Sequoia trampled over a fighting :
! Theta Chi team 24 to 8 in the feature
. game of the intramural basketball
; play last night. In other contests of |
the evening El Toro went on a wild ,
shooting spree to gather in a 30 to 6 1
; victory over S.A.E. while El Campo
downed Encina 5 in a heated strug- j
gle by an 18-13 score.
Two games are scheduled for to- \
night in the gym; Los Arcos vs. Phi
i Kappa Psi at 7 o'clock and Phi Delta 1
Theta vs. Menlo hashers at 8 o'clock.
Because of the varsity game in the 1
pavilion at the same time, the intra
mural frays may be postponed by j
i mutual consent of the participants.
Sequoia displayed the same smooth j
I teamwork that has distinguished their
play in earlier games. They forged I
| to a clean lead soon after the tip-off,
j and by a stubborn defense held their j,
| opponents scoreless during the first j
i period. They breezed easily through
the remaining play, Palmberg help- ;
ing himself to 9 points to take home
I high-scoring honors.
Encina 5 and El Campo struggled
furiously throughout an interesting
contest. Leading at half time 10 to 7, |
| the Club found themselves in a dan- |
gerous position when the hall men,
spurred on by Pellegrini, drew up on j
even terms. With the score tied at
: 13 up, Cox came through with two |
' baskets and a free throw for El
Campo, which put the score 18 to 13,
1 where it stood until the end of the \
game.
In their meeting with Sigma Alpha i
Epsilon the El Toro's broke out in a
fever of miraculous shooting to run
their total up to 30 points to offset
the meagre 6 of their opponents, j
Everybody shot and everybody sank
his attempts for the club. Oppen
heim with 10 markers and Fisher j
with 8 led the van of high-point men i
for El Toro.
Neither team showed up for the |
. scheduled Kappa Sigma-Phi Gamma]'
, Delta game.
