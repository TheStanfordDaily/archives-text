## Aviation, Theology Studied By Ex-Kaiser 
### 
DOORN, Holland, 26. (/1 J )—
I As he enters his 73rd year tomor
i row, Wilhelm 11, former Emperor of
; Germany, ean look back upon an
| active twelve months during which
jhe has devoted much time to his
I favorite studies along four lines—
| aviation, theology, archaeology, and
i the so-called "war guilt" question.
Although he never has ridden in
! an airship, the former German ruler
! has followed the progress of avia
! tion with keen interest and is famil
; iar with all phases of aeronautics,
j He watches every ocean flight close
i ly and he is personally acquainted
•. with some of the famous fliers of
! today.
He took a great interest last Oc
| tober in the opening of the valuable
; Pergamon Museum at Berlin. About
i once a year there is a sort of
| archaelogocical congress at Doom
iManor, to which leading savants
from various European countries
J are invited.
In connection with the "war guilt"
j question the former Kaiser is bent
j upon proving to the world that Ger
| many was not responsible for the
j war. Every movement made by a
i serious investigator which he con-
I siders erroneous, he challenges and
! tries to disprove.
