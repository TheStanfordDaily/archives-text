# HARVARD SCIENTIST SUPPORTS THEORIES OF PLANETARY LIFE
## Believes Atmosphere On Venus, Mars Is Livable 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 26 (/}>).â€”
Dr. Leon Campbell, instructor of as
tronomy at Harvard University, to
day supported the theory that the
planets Mars and Venus have some
forms of life.
With others at Harvard, Dr. Camp
bell is making a close study of Eros,
an asteroid or planetary fragment
and it was in this connection that he
gave his opinion concerning habita
tion of other planets in the solar sys
tem.
"Our work," Dr. Campbell said,
"proves that Mars is not a cold planet
in the sense that it has not life. At
mosphere as determined on Mars are
found to be livable. The temperature
in the middle of the day is sixty de
grees above zero Fahrenheit. It
ranges downward 100 degrees. The
same range exists on our planet, but
the temperature does not drop 100
degrees in a single day here as it
may on Mars."
