# Vocational Guidance Quiz Shows Banking Popular
## 
### BY SHANNON ALLEN 
That the field of banking interests j
the majority of Stanford students !
was revealed yesterday by the i
A.S.S.U. Vocational Guidance Com- ]
mittee as the result of a question- j
naire sent out last quarter on the j
subject of "Selecting a Vocation."
The student committee, under Ihe .
chairmanship of Gilbert Carr, re- ;
quested information in the question- j
naire concerning the most popular
vocation. Several hundred replies j
were received.
Next in choice to banking was the J
field of aviation, with engineering |
and law following in order. Adver- j
tising, business, mining, and petro- |
leum were included as among the
most popular vocations.
Contrary to expectations engineer- ]
ing and business were lower in the

list this year than formerly, accord
ing to the committer. They attri
buted this to the present period of
economic depression.
A few answers showed a leaning
toward social work, such as the vo
cation of prison officer. Others
showed a desire to take up religious
work.
Contrary to common belief only 1
a very few students expressed a de- 1
sire to go into the bond or insur
ance sales business.
The Vocational Guidance Com
mittee holds office hours in the of
fice of the A.S.S.U. President every
Monday and Thursday afternoon
from 2 to 3 o'clock, at which time
men seeking any information on this
subject will be able to find assist
ance.
