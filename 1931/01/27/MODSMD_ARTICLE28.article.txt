# INDIAN SECOND STRING CAGERS FACE CLUBMEN
## Regulars Rest For U.C.L.A. Tilt As "Subs" Play For Experience BUNN PROMISES FIGHT 
### Jack Jernegan 
Stanford will take on the Olympic
Club basketball team here tonight
with the "number two" quintet on
the floor and will fight it out with
I that line if it takes all night. Such
is (he effect of a statement by Coach
j John Bunn yesterday in regard to
j Cardinal tactics for this contest.
When the varsity tilt, preceded by
a freshman preliminary with Gali
leo at 6:150 o'clock, gets under way
at 8 o'clock not a single member of
the first string quintet will be on
the floor for Stanford. Hawkins and
Tyler will be in at forwards, Doub
at center, and Baker and Mears at
guard.
No Let-down Planned
j This does not mean, most decided
ly it does not mean, that the Red
skins are merely going to sit back
and rest while the Post Street hoop
sters win an easy victory and trot
serenely back to their lair.
Bunn declares that he never platts
a game with Ihe idea of losing H;
when he sends a team into a con
test it is with the determination to
come out on top. And he believes
that, man for man, the players who
will start tonight are the equals of
those who make up the first string,
the only difference being that the
regulars work more smoothly to
gether.
Indians Out To Win
Consequently the Cardinals are
! out to win tonight, and they feel
; that thoy can win. All of the second
line men will be fighting for a place
, on the first five, which will mean
that there won't be any let-up in
I the play on Stanford's part.
The Indians will meet a mighty
tough foe tonight, for the Winged
; "O" cagers are a bunch of experi
-1 enced and expert players who have
, encountered a lot of strong teams
| this season. Led by Ray Maloney,
sharp-shooting forward, the San
Francisco aggregation would rate an
( edge over the Stanford regulars and
j must in consequence be accorded
j the favorite's position for the scrap
with the number two men.
Two factors that favor the Indians
i and may make the tide of battle
even are the facts that the clubmen
played a game with the Y.M.C.A.
j of San Francisco last night and that
1 the game will be played in the
| Stanford Pavilion, which often seems
to throw visiting teams off-stride.
With respect to the somewhat sur
i prising move of using only his re
serves in the contest, Bunn declared
1 that he has a double objective. In
j the first place he wants to give the
reserves all the experience that they
1 can get in non-conference games.
If he can keep these men up to first
team standard he will be able to
| make substitutions in the importan
games without weakening the eom
j bination.
In the second place he feels that
j the men who worked hmxl agains*
| California Saturday may not be in
j good shape to play a strenuous til*
tonight and will be better off lor
! the U.C.L.A. contest next week-end
if they have a lay-off in the mean
time. It is npt improbable (hit the
! reserves, who are fresh, will play
better ball than would the regular?,
if they are still feeling 'he effect of
the California game.

Stanford will take on the Olympic
Club basketball team here tonight
with the "number two" quintet on
the floor and will fight it out with
I that line if it takes all night. Such
is (he effect of a statement by Coach
j John Bunn yesterday in regard to
j Cardinal tactics for this contest.
When the varsity tilt, preceded by
a freshman preliminary with Gali
leo at 6:150 o'clock, gets under way
at 8 o'clock not a single member of
the first string quintet will be on
the floor for Stanford. Hawkins and
Tyler will be in at forwards, Doub
at center, and Baker and Mears at
guard.
No Let-down Planned
j This does not mean, most decided
ly it does not mean, that the Red
skins are merely going to sit back
and rest while the Post Street hoop
sters win an easy victory and trot
serenely back to their lair.
Bunn declares that he never platts
a game with Ihe idea of losing H;
when he sends a team into a con
test it is with the determination to
come out on top. And he believes
that, man for man, the players who
will start tonight are the equals of
those who make up the first string,
the only difference being that the
regulars work more smoothly to
gether.
