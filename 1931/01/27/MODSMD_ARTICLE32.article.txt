A recent contribution to the Campus Opinion column complains
bitterlv about the lack of courage of Stanford students, dissatisfied
with their business relations with the [ 'Diversity but afraid to object.
Ouoting from his letter, devoted chiefly to a criticism of the
Stanford health service, "There are other items about the I'niver
sitv's business relations with its students that we would kick about if
we had a backbone instead of a sheepskin wishbone."
After thus bewailing the lack of temerity of Stanford students,
the Campus Opinion writer appends this note to his letter, "1 he
above letter to the editor is submitted for publication only on the
condition that the identity of tlic writer be held confidential."
Mis note seems rather out of place after his remarks concerning
student backbones. The Daily maintains its Campus Opinion col
umn as a forum of student opinion, with only one restriction —that
contributors names be attached. ( riticism. pr<> or con, on any sub
ject will be printed, provided the writer's names or their initials are
also published with the contribution.
