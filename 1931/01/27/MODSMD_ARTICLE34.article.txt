# FOLLOW STANFORD'S EXAMPLE
## 
### 
An admirable system of student government is working at Stan
ford I'niversity. As an example of it. twenty-three members of a
language class, convicted of violating the honor code, were recently
placed on honorary probation. Six others who were convicted were
llunked in the course and placed 011 probation to boot. This was .'ill
done by the men's and women's councils, organs of student self ex
pression.
The honor code in itself is very desirable. I'ut it could not be
used effectively unless there were an organization such as at Stan
ford.
The councils at Stanford have declared that if any of the violators
of the. honor code are convicted again, they will be expelled from
school. And those organizations have the necessary power and ma
chinery to accomplish such a move.
Many students at Nebraska would like a Student Council with
power such as the Stanford councils possess. \ constitution which
would give approximately such power is before the subcommittee of
the faculty committee on student organizations. It is hoped ibis com
mittee and the other committees which must pass on the document
before it is brought to the students will see the light and allow
progressive piece of work to be passed.
If they do, final decision will lay with the students. And if.the,
students reallv want a council with more power all they will have to
do is put down their signature in the right spot. Let us hope that
lime will not be long in coming. The Daily Ncbmskaii.
The F.ditorial staff will meet at 1:15 o'clock today instead oi at
the usual hour of I o'clock.
