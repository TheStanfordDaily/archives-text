TOLABLE DAVID—At the Califor
nia Theatre, Mayfield.
"Tol'able David" bids fair to be
1 the maker of two stars, for Richard
! Cromwell does a splendid job of the
talkie version of the Joseph Herge
sheimer story which started Richard
Barthelmess on the highroad to
fame.
What was one of the greatest of
' silent pictures loses little in its
audible resurrection, Cromwell hav
! ing been surrounded with a stellar
cast which includes Noah Beery,
Henry B. Walthall, and Joan Peers,
j Those who saw the original will
undoubtedly enjoy seeing the talkie
! version, and those who did not
! should not miss it. —L. C.
TIIE JACK-ROLLER—By Clifford
R. Shaw. The University of Chi
cago Press, Chicago. IJ).'SQ. (At the
Palo Alto Library.)
i"The Jack-Roller," a delinquent
. boy's own story, records the ex
pensive reclamation of an erring
' child to society by University of
Chicago psychologists acting in col
i laboration with the forces of law
i and love.
"Jack-rolling" is prison parlance
for the mean practice of slugging
' and robbing drunks. It is only one
] of the illegal diversions performed
for measly profit that this book de
scribes.
Biiefly deducing: the criminal is
i the natural product of an unkind

I environment. Usually the innocent !
; victim of a cruel circumstance, he
! is not apt to be won to the society
he despises by the modern methodi
cal and stupid persecution mis
named correction.
Crime is the natural consequence
| of social neglect. The society which '
1 permits crime is more guilty than [
the individual who commits it. Hu
manitarians demand prison reform.
Following out the advice of short- 1
! sighted snivelers will not solve the
problem. Society must remove the
cause to eradicate the result.

ILLICIT—At <lie Stanford Theatre.
| "Illicit" is billed as one of those
| pictures best suited for adult minds.
- Whether the producers actually be
lieved this to be true, or whether
they merely wished to attract larger !
| crowds is a question not easily set
l tied. There really is nothing frankly
i immoral about "Illicit." It is not one
i tenth as bad as many more obscure
shows.
Barbara Stanwyck stars as the
girl who is afraid of marriage. James !
Rennie, Rieardo Cortez, Natalie j
Moorhead are among the supporting
! cast. In general the acting is good !
| and the action runs smoothly. There ;
are some places, though, when slight,
! hitches occur. Claude Gilligwater
as the inevitable drunk is delight
ful and deserving of a better role.
