# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
With another basketball game |
coming up, tonight, we call your at- :
tention to a deplorable situation on
the Stanford campus. Our registra- :
tion books say we may choose be- ;
tween physical training and mili
tary practice, and now military j
training is compulsory to most of j
| us. After basketball season is over, ,
every rooter will be accustomed to I
gunfire, whether he likes it or no.
Something should he done
about conflicts at pedestrian in
tersections on the Quad. If
you're going full speed around I
a corner and bump into half the
varsity football squad, you can
beam momentarily, mutter
apologies, and slink away. But
when the obstruction is only a
! life-sized gravoltruck, Mr. Pre/.i- j
dent, we object. What are side
walks for? (No, we don't mean
hopscotch, either.)
There may be room for something
I else on the reading desk in the li
-1 brary, now that rushing is tempor
! arily out of mind. The various
! sorority national magazines were re
' moved yesterday, after being on

| display for the past week. Even the
; library worries about it! Odearodear! j
Now we wonder if the word
"snake" owes its use to the fact
(hat snakes are supposed to he
able to hypnotize chickens?
Dirges (translate: "songs of death- ;
j warning") are being sung for P-ul j
! Spe-gle, prominent campus man, ,
. who has had to capture and hold [
autopsies on three hundred moths 1
in order to get his tuxedo back. Now
t he has lost his suspenders.
SOPHOMORE SIGHS
I hold an ice-cream cone and
think
How oh! beer glasses used <o
clink
When underclassmen used to
drink
At places other than the sink . .
Bewail what fate has done (o
meâ€”
I'm of the Class of '33.

Pineapple was served for lunch
eon, yesterday, at Roble. What a j
doleful dessert!
