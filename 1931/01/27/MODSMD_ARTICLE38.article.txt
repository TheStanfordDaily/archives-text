Today we come to speak
To you in song and story;
The former sad and sweet,
The latter somewhat gory.

The Song
Not that I did not remember, dear, ,
Was thine so sad a lot,
Though all I brought to thee of cheer
| Was little enough, God wot;
For though I've caused thee many a
tear,
Think not, believe it not,
j No, not that I did not remember,
dear,
But just that I forgot.
The Story
A supercilious dago
Who suffered from lumbago
Was halted by an overzealous cop:
V/hcn clapped upon the shoulder,
His eyes began to smoulder:
A wop atop a cop, his stop a flop.
And say, how about those contri
butions? The address is 324 S. 11th
Street, San Jose, or hail us on the
Quad.
