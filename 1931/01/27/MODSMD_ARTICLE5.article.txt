### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (/P).—Red
Cross receipts today totaled $2,205,-
000 in its campaign to raise a $10,000.-
000 relief fund.
Simultaneously it announced that
reports from drought areas indicated
the traditional one-crop planting
would be abandoned for the practice
of diversified farming with the com
ing of spring.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26
retary Hyde declared today the ag
riculture department was making
loans under emergency relief meas
ures as rapidly as possible to aid em
ployment and relieve drought strick
en farmers.
Called before the House Appro
priations Committee to testify on the
Senate $25,000,000 Red Cross relief
fund, Hyde said that to his knowl
edge no actual loan under the $45,-
000.000 drought fund for loans for
seed, feed and fertilizer had been
made.
Chairman Wood of the committee,
explained at the beginning of the
hearing that the purpose "is to ob
tain to the fullest possible extent all
facts" as to the needs of the country
for funds to be used in purchase of
food for those in distress.
Wood laid aside committee rules
and permitted public instead of secret
hearings as originally planned.
Hyde testified that the actual area
affected by the drought in which crop
production was less than 30 per cent
of normal could be considered twice
as large as Arkansas. It included
that state and sections in southern
and mid-western states of an equal
aggregate area.
As far as the nation as a whole was
effected by the drought, he said only
the corn and hay crops, along with
pasture, suffered. The corn crop, he
said, was about 300,000,000 bushels
short.
J. B. Kinger, agricultural meteorol
ogist, said today thus far conditions
generally in drought sections are
much worse than a year ago. At the
same time he saw a possible fall of
snows or heavy spring rains still
might remedy dry subsoil conditions.
"If Congress is going to do any
thing." Byrns said, "we should do it
immediately. Every member of Con
gress understands the actual condi
tion existing throughout the coun
try."

loans under emergency relief meas
ures as rapidly as possible to aid em
ployment and relieve drought strick
en farmers.
Called before the House Appro
priations Committee to testify on the
Senate $25,000,000 Red Cross relief
fund, Hyde said that to his knowl
edge no actual loan under the $45,-
000.000 drought fund for loans for
seed, feed and fertilizer had been
made.
Chairman Wood of the committee,
explained at the beginning of the
hearing that the purpose "is to ob
tain to the fullest possible extent all
facts" as to the needs of the country
for funds to be used in purchase of
food for those in distress.
Wood laid aside committee rules
and permitted public instead of secret
hearings as originally planned.
Hyde testified that the actual area
affected by the drought in which crop
production was less than 30 per cent
of normal could be considered twice
as large as Arkansas. It included
that state and sections in southern
and mid-western states of an equal
aggregate area.
As far as the nation as a whole was
effected by the drought, he said only
the corn and hay crops, along with
pasture, suffered. The corn crop, he
said, was about 300,000,000 bushels
short.
J. B. Kinger, agricultural meteorol
ogist, said today thus far conditions
generally in drought sections are
much worse than a year ago. At the
same time he saw a possible fall of
snows or heavy spring rains still
might remedy dry subsoil conditions.
"If Congress is going to do any
thing." Byrns said, "we should do it
immediately. Every member of Con
gress understands the actual condi
tion existing throughout the coun
try."
