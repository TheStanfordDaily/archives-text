QUITE A LEAGUE

Standings in the southern division
of the Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball league, after Saturday's con
flicts, reveal a close race i'or the
title. Following is the order of quin
tets:
Won Lost
U.C.L.A 3 1
California 2 1
Stanford 2 3
U.S.C 1 3
So closely are the four teams
matched that seven points, right
ly distributed, would have com
pletely changed the course ''112
events in 110 less than four
games. California lost to Stan
ford in a game where one point
in the regular time meant vic
tory or defeat. Southern Cali
fornia dropped a game to the
Bears by two points, while the
Bruins won one from Stanford
by the margin of a field goal and
iost a tangle to California by the
same slim edge.
As matters now stand, no team is
completely out of the running in the
Conference scramble, while all of
the games are certain to be close.
Stanford plays four more league
clashes, and two of them are to be
played on foreign soil. The Indians
meet Sam Barry's Trojans down
South, and have another tete-a-tete
set with California at the Oakland
Auditorium. The other three teams
each have five hurdles to clear.
After the Olympic Club com
bat tonight, the Indians will at
tempt to assimilate the Bruins
as well as they dealt with the
elder brother. Having lost two
contests to U.C.L.A. in the Con
ference openers, the Bunn five
must produce a torrid game to
take the final meeting with
Caddy Works' combination, litis
scrimmage will mark the Bruins'
first and last appearance on the
Farm during the hoop
havoc.
According to advance dope, the
regulars will nst tonight, leaving
the reserves to deal wiih the Club
five. The game should be none the
less interesting on that account, for
although the Winged "O" has an ag
gregation of stars, the so-called
"Gray" cagers should give them an
interesting evening. Men like Meade,
Palmer, Hawkins, Tyler, Hancock,
Tway, Edelen, and others do fairly
well themselves, thank you.
Tli at freshman team looked
fairly well against the Bear
Cubs. Topping is easily the out
standing Papoose hoopster, with
Smith out of the game. Packard
is siili a triile green on short
shots, but Massey's speed and
Jenkins' height help the fresh
men considerably. Due to their
failure to stop Eifert. the Red
shirts lost to California, but they
looked like a basketball team
more consistently than before.

take the final meeting with
Caddy Works' combination, litis
scrimmage will mark the Bruins'
first and last appearance on the
Farm during the hoop
havoc.
According to advance dope, the
regulars will nst tonight, leaving
the reserves to deal wiih the Club
five. The game should be none the
less interesting on that account, for
although the Winged "O" has an ag
gregation of stars, the so-called
"Gray" cagers should give them an
interesting evening. Men like Meade,
Palmer, Hawkins, Tyler, Hancock,
Tway, Edelen, and others do fairly
well themselves, thank you.
Tli at freshman team looked
fairly well against the Bear
Cubs. Topping is easily the out
standing Papoose hoopster, with
Smith out of the game. Packard
is siili a triile green on short
shots, but Massey's speed and
Jenkins' height help the fresh
men considerably. Due to their
failure to stop Eifert. the Red
shirts lost to California, but they
looked like a basketball team
more consistently than before.

QUITE A LEAGUE

Standings in the southern division
of the Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball league, after Saturday's con
flicts, reveal a close race i'or the
title. Following is the order of quin
tets:
Won Lost
U.C.L.A 3 1
California 2 1
Stanford 2 3
U.S.C 1 3
So closely are the four teams
matched that seven points, right
ly distributed, would have com
pletely changed the course ''112
events in 110 less than four
games. California lost to Stan
ford in a game where one point
in the regular time meant vic
tory or defeat. Southern Cali
fornia dropped a game to the
Bears by two points, while the
Bruins won one from Stanford
by the margin of a field goal and
iost a tangle to California by the
same slim edge.
As matters now stand, no team is
completely out of the running in the
Conference scramble, while all of
the games are certain to be close.
Stanford plays four more league
clashes, and two of them are to be
played on foreign soil. The Indians
meet Sam Barry's Trojans down
South, and have another tete-a-tete
set with California at the Oakland
Auditorium. The other three teams
each have five hurdles to clear.
After the Olympic Club com
bat tonight, the Indians will at
tempt to assimilate the Bruins
as well as they dealt with the
elder brother. Having lost two
contests to U.C.L.A. in the Con
ference openers, the Bunn five
must produce a torrid game to
take the final meeting with
Caddy Works' combination, litis
scrimmage will mark the Bruins'
first and last appearance on the
Farm during the hoop
havoc.
