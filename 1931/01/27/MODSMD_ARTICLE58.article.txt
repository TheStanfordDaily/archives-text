Who can ever forget the deeds
I of the Passaic High School basket
ball team of nine and ten years
ago? The "Wonder Teams" of Coach
! "Prof" Blood of 1918-'2l set so many
basketball records that it would
1 take a book to enumerate them all.
| But lend us your cars, you court
| fans, and I'll remind you of a few
j of them. So here goes! ,
i "Century" scores were common
occurrences wilh this marvelous
outfit. The highest was a 345 to 5 <
triumph over Williams Prep, of
Connecticut. This was the game in ;
which Bobby Thompson, a forward, '
scored sixty-nine points.
400 Points a Week
They beai Englewood 133 to 18, j
Ocean City 122 to 6 and 109 to 1(5,
Haekensack (the team that finally
snapped their winning streak of 159 •
games) 109 to 23, George Washing
ton 19 to 18. Jamaica 91 to 19, and
Madison 104 to 23. And, as men
tioned iii my cartoon, they won four
victories in one week, scoring 100
points or more in each game!
In thirty-two games in the 1922
. season Thompson scored exactly*J
1000 points, a world's record. But
don't forget good old Fritz Knothe,
who performed the role of "Tom
my's" feeder and was generally
■ recognized throughout the land as
the peer of all schoolboy guards of
his day. He later had a tryout with
• the Yankees and is now in the
' Coast League. Thompson had to

I quit the game because of an athletic
| heart.
Mike Hamas scored sixty-three
points in the big victory over Engle
wood. His brother, Steve, a ten
; letter man at Penn State and now a
j successful professional boxer, wasn't
I good enough to make the team. Mike
! once gave a foul-shooting exhibition
j in which he made 100 consecutive
baskets! ''Prof" Blood, the coach,
| however, made. 105 fouls out of 107
i attempts in another exhibition and
! when he was more than fifty-five
j years old, too!
In twelve years, the team has
never tasted defeat on its own court,
I and the five has won the New Jer
j sey State title seven times!
Now how's that for a record?
