# HELEN WILLS MOODY GIVING EXHIBITION HERE ON THURSDAY
## 
### Richard Van Wagenen 
Helen Wills Moody, who will play
in a series of exhibition sets here
Thursday, is well-known for her
complete domination of womer/s
tennis, but perhaps a fact which has
escaped general knowledge is the
proof of her superiority over her
rivals.
She has attained the record of
never having been carried to deuce
games by.any player during" the last
three years of her championship. In
the 1929 national tournament she
went through to the final round
with the achievement of having lost
a total of but two games in all her
matches.
Mrs. L. A. Harper, finalist in the
1929 Pacific Southwest Tournament,
who will also play here Thursday,
has been among the first ten rank
ing players for the last three years.
Phil Neer, another visitor Thursday,
prominent in many recent tourna
ments, brought home the national
intercollegiate championship for
himself and Stanford in 1921.
It is likely that Keith Gledhill,
fourth ranking California player and
former national junior singles and
doubles champion, and Cautain Ted
Easton, active in numerous local and
eastern tournaments, will be tem
porarily outshone by the brilliance
of the visitors day after tomorrow.
