bis way to a decision over Portal in a fast, rough extra
round bout, Fred Johnson, captain of the varsity boxing team, won a
place for himself on the card of the University championship matches in
the most sensational encounter of yesterday's preliminaries in the Encina
gym gallery. Portal pressed the varsity middleweight star throughout the
match. In the lirst round both men sparred cautiously, with Johnson
holding a slight advantage. Ihe second frame opened with a slugging
flurry. Portal kept leaping in and forcing the light, artfully ducking and
sidestepping many of Johnson's counters.. In one furious exchange of

blows Portal caught his opponent off
balance and dropped him to the
floor, but Johnson was right up
again, and the round ended nearly
even.
