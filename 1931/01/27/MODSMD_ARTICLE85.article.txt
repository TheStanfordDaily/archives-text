HAMBURG, Germany, Jan. 26 (A 3 )
â€”A woman's baton for the first time
led Karl Muck's philharmonic or
chestra here tonight.
The conductress was an American,
Miss Antonia Brico, of Berkeley. Last
year she made something of a sensa
tion by being the first woman to con
duct the Berlin Philharmonic Orches
tra. She has been a pupil of Dr.
Muck.
