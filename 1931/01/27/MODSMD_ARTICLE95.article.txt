# COST OF LIGHTED AIRWAYS EXCEEDS ANNUAL BUDGET
## Night Air Routes Necessary Despite Future Bill Of $10,000,000 
### 
I WASHINGTON, Jan. 26. (/P) â€”
Ten million dollars a year is the
prospective bill for the country's
night-lighted airplane routes.
With something like a shock, gov- i
i ernment officials have the \
[ size of the expenditure they let j
i themselves in for when Congress
; decided to furnish illumination for I
the air routes.
Maintenance Asked t
At present the expense is about i
$210,000 a, year for each 1,000 miles i
| of lighted airways, distinctly above j
the original estimate. The eventual j
total cost was computed by Secre- !
tary Lamont, under whose jurisdic- :
! tion in the Commerce department !
! the expenditure comes. Yet, he has
concluded after a special review of
the situation, that the expenditure |
| will have to be maintained.
"My attention to the matter was
: drawn when Congressional commit
-1 tees first undertook to review the
department's appropriations," Secre- [
I tary Lamont said, "and some repre- 1
j sentatives of experience protested
( then that such expenditure had been
I estimated in advance to run only to
i a limit of $750,000 annually.
Economy Used
"Yet we have now worked out
I costs, testing them in operation, and
j making the economies suggested by
| experience, and find that $200 per
I year per mile is the lowest charge
J which can be expected.
"That will mean, even if the light
ed airway mileage is held down to
i limits now projected, that eventually
' the government will have to spend
the $10,000,000 sum given each year
in making the routes available."
