# LOESCH STATES CHICAGO WILL REDUCE CRIME
## Veteran Gangland Fighter Lauds Exposing Of Capone's Men CAMPAIGN DESCRIBED 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 27. (/P)—Frank J. 1
Loesch, president of the Chicago
Crime Commission and member of
the Wickersham Law Enforcement
Commission, promised the nation
tonight that Chicago, "the first city
to realize its responsibilities to itself :
and its neighbors," would settle the
crime problem "and settle it right."
"Chicago is the first city in the
world," Loesch told a radio audi
ence over the National Broadcasting
Company network, "to recognize the
serious fact of crime, drag it into the
open, and declare war. It is per
forming a service not only to itself,
but to its neighbors, because it
realizes that crime anywhere means
crime everywhere. And it will finish
that job."
Policy Praised
The city has a reputation as a
crime center, said the ageing foe of ,
gangland, not because there is more
crime here but because Chicago has
courage and fortitude to acknowl
edge our owii shortcomings.
The war on crime started twelve
years ago, Loesch said, with the
creation of the Chicago Crime Com
mission for the sole purpose of driv
ing out the gangsters. The attack
was recently concentrated, he con
tinued, "upon a selected group of
28 professional criminals of which
Alphonse Capone is the overlord.
Gangsters Trapped '
"They were listed, branded 'pub
lic enemies,' and a vigorous cam
paign begun. Constant, continuing
pressure was exerted until, after six
months' strenuous activity, I may
summarize the status of these 'pub
lic enemies' tonight.
"Two are dead at the hands of
their own kind.
"Three arc serving penitentiary I
sentences.
"Two have been sentenced to a
federal prison."
