# LOVE INTEREST LACKING IN PLAY
## All-Male Cast To Present "Wings Over Europe" 
### 
The eighth wonder of the modern
stage—a play without love interest —
comes to the campus this Friday
night with the performance of
"Wings Over Europe," in the As
sembly Hall.
Instead of planning on sex to lure
the roughs and the "500'' to the box
office between now and Friday eve
ning, Harold Helvenston, director of
dramatics, has built his hopes on fine
character performance to do the
trick. All-amateur, all-male though
the cast may be, so much dramatic
talent has been exhibited in re
hearsal, according to Helvenston,
that even a play without the three
W's—Wine, Women and Wickedness,
will be thoroughly enjoyed by dis
criminating patrons.
The realms of science as the very
latest source of plots have been ex
plored to give the play its highly
unusual flavor. When a mad scientist
of the future threatens the destruc
tion of the world if the British Cabi
net does not help him re-arrange
atomic matter for mankind's good,
the cabinet members, seeing pros
pects of the world going up before
their eyes and they with it, reveal
their true personalities, thus giving
talented actors a splendid chance to
show the kind of stuff their talents
are made of.
So difficult are the character por
trayals that Stanford will have the
honor of 'being the first and only
American university to produce the
play. But Helvenston and others
who have seen the players in re
hearsals believe that audience en
joyment this Friday night will more
than justify the production.
