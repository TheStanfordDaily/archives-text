# GANDHI FREE, STANDS FIRM ANTI-BRITISH
## Out Of Prison, Frail Rebel Leader Reavows Hope Of Independence 
### 
BOMBAY, British India, Jan. 27.
(/P) —Mahatma Gandhi, toothless,
shriveled, wraith of a man, sat
cross-legged on a stone floor today,
serving notice on the British Em
pire that India's campaign of civil
disobedience would continue una
bated, while outside a frantic crowd,
mad for a glimpse of him, struggled
so furiously that a woman was
crushed to death.
Round Table in Vain
Regardless of Mac Donald's pro
posals and of the approaching peace
talks with delegates returning from
the Round Table Conference, he
said, all activities of the Nationalists
—the boycott on foreign cloth, the
refusal to pay taxes, the picketing
of shops—will continue.
Speaking excellent English and
weighing every word carefully, the
little man elaborated the first state
ment of policy he has made since
he was released last night from the
prison at Poona where he spent
nearly oiine months.
India Unreconciled
"No amount of good will estab
lished between Great Britain and
India will, so far as I can see, recon
cile the Indian public to the evils
of alcohol and foreign cloth, and the
refusal of the government to allow
the peasants to make their own salt."
It was for making salt in definance
of the British law that Gandhi was
sent to prison.
Sees Democracy
"The authorities evidently do not
yet understand that the Nationalist
movement has so affected the minds
of the masses that their leaders are
utterly unable to dictate any course
of action. In my opinion this is a
very healthy condition, for inde
pendent thinking is the / very es
sence of democracy."
