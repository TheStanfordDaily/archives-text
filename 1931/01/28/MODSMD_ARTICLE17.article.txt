# PIKE CHOSEN FOR COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP
## Men's Council Post Filled By Executive Group; Concert Planned 
### 
Tom Pike, president of the assso
ciated students, was appointed to fill
the vacancy on Men's Council left
by the resignation of Phil Moffatt,
at the regular weekly meeting of the
Executive Committee of the A.S.S.U.
in the Old Union last night.
Moffatt's resignation from the stu
dent judiciary group because of con
flicting activities was tendered the
Committee at the meeting and ac
cepted. Pike will hold office until
the regular winter student body
elections on February 11, when the
position will be submitted to the
polls.
The appointment of Francis Bates,
Jr., to the senior handball manager
ship for the '931 season was ap
proved by the legislative body.
Carl McDowell, A.S.S.U. Concert
Series manager, informed the Com
mittee that an extra concert, which
would be given by Mischa Elman,
noted violinist, in the first week of
Spring Quarter, was under consider
ation.
McDowell declared that the deci
sion would depend on whether or
not a large enough audience could
be obtained to lessen the estimated
deficit which the series will have
incurred at the close of the current
season. No definite arrangements
have yet been made, he said.
A request for an appropriation to
the Rifle Club, to be used by that
organization in the construction of
a pistol range in the basement of the
Administration Building, was laid
aside for future consideration.
The minutes of the Publications
Council meeting of January 21 were
accepted by the Committee.
