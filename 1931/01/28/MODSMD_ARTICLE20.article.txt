# Teacher-Tenure Bill Is Advocated By Almack
## 
### 
Favoring the teacher-tenure bill
now before the legislature, Proies
sor J. C. Almack, of the School of
Education, believes that "protection
of labor as well as other natural
resources" should be a universal
principle.
"You do not allow displacement of
a capable .bank teller just because
another man wants the job. Critics
of the measure say that it has no
precedent. If not, it is high time to
establish one. But the civil service,
similar in principle, was finally in
troduced after, a hard fight."
The bill, endorsed by the Calilor
nia State Teachers Association at
its December convention, has two
main provisions: first, that after
three years of consecutive service
teachers shall receive tenure except
in districts having fewer than .100
pupils, in which district tenure shall
be permissive rather than manda
tory; second, that a dismissed leath
er may appeal to a professional body

of seven school people appointed by
the state superintendent of public
instruction and consisting also of
three teachers of the same status as
the appellant and three from ad
joining counties.
That rural boards objected be
cause they have not understood the
law is Professor Almack's belief. "It
is harder to get a teacher to suit a
limited rural community than a city
because in the latter a teacher may
be transferred to another school in
the same system. The rural board
takes the viewpoint that it is im
possible for any teacher to stay in
the country town more than a few
years because in that period the
teacher collects many objections to
it."
Commending the second provision,
that relating (o appeals, Professor
Almack said that if it passes, the
courts will become the last resort,
with a corresponding boon to pro
fessional ideals and removal of fric
i lion.
