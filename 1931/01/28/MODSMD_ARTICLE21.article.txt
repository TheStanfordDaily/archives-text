# Indians Drop Hectic Overtime Battle To Olympic Five, 36-35
## Boberg Sinks Foul Shot to Put Game Away in Extra Period; Bunn's Second String Battles Club On Even Terms Throughout Game 
### BY' STEWART CRAWFORD 
POOL, blond, and smiling in spite of frenzied yelling from a mob of
thrill-fired fans, Cal Boberg, brilliant guard for the invading Olympic
Club five, sank a free throw near the end of a five-minute overtime period
last night to give the Club quintet a 36 to ;».! victory over the Stanford
Indian in one of the weirdest and most hectic basketball struggles ever
witnessed in the Pavilion. After a hard-fighting combination of Rcdshirt
second-stringers had battled for 10 minutes of free-for-all basketball on
even terms with the strong Olympian quintet, Coach John Bunn sent in

liis entire varsity five to see what
they could do in five short minutes
about breaking up the 33-33 dead
lock.

For three hectic minutes the ball
changed hands repeatedly, going up
and down the court while the crowd
stood on its feet, yelling itself
hoarse. But neither team seemed
able to work the leather sphere into
scoring distance, and long shot after
long shot missed by inches. Finally
Schuppert, forward for the invaders,
1 running fast down the center of the
court, received a well-timed pass to
put one in from just back of the
foul line, and the Cardinal rooters'
hearts sank—33 to 35.
A moment later, however, Captain
Mike Reynolds, parked under the
opponents' bucket, took a long throw
from Cordry and calmly dropped a
set-up shot with no one near him—
35 to 35.

The fans fairly went wild as

j on the tip-off starting the last and
deciding minute or so. The ball went
,to Stanford. Dribbling down the
floor in an attempt to get around
Boberg and into scoring territory,
Vance Fawcett went a step too far,
: and the. blond guard succeeded in
! getting the ball away from him.
Fawcett, too eager to return the
compliment, fouled Boberg in what
j proved to be a fatal misfortune, for
the gun ended the game two sec
i onds after the Olympian made good
his dramatic foul shot.

Club five, sank a free throw near the end of a five-minute overtime period
last night to give the Club quintet a 36 to ;».! victory over the Stanford
Indian in one of the weirdest and most hectic basketball struggles ever
witnessed in the Pavilion. After a hard-fighting combination of Rcdshirt
second-stringers had battled for 10 minutes of free-for-all basketball on

For three hectic minutes the ball
changed hands repeatedly, going up
and down the court while the crowd
stood on its feet, yelling itself
hoarse. But neither team seemed
able to work the leather sphere into
scoring distance, and long shot after
long shot missed by inches. Finally
Schuppert, forward for the invaders,
1 running fast down the center of the
court, received a well-timed pass to
put one in from just back of the
foul line, and the Cardinal rooters'
hearts sank—33 to 35.
A moment later, however, Captain
Mike Reynolds, parked under the
