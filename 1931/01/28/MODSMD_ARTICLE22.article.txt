# Large Audience Hears McManus String Program
## Quartet Well Received By Appreciative Crowd 
### 
Marguerite MacManus and her'
string quartet, consisting of Elizabeth
Peirce, second violinist, Lucelia
Bates, playing the viola, and Norma
Letroadec, violin-cellist, entertained
a large audience in the Little Thea
tre last night. Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist, accompanied the
quartet at the piano.
The program featured the compo
sitions of Mozart and Schumann. The
first number, Mozart's Quartet in C
; major, divided into four parts,
Adagio-Allegro, Andante cantabile,
1 Menuetto, and Allegro molto, was
played with precision and artistry,
in the rather formal manner typical
,of the composer's style. More feel
ing was expressed in the Quintet,
Opus 44, in E flat major, by Robert
Schumann, of which the third move
ment, Scherzo-Molto vivace, was the
i best received.
In a brief interview at the close
of the concert, Mrs. MacManus said,
"We wish to express our gratitude
to the audience for the kind enthu
siasm with which they received our
program, and to Mr. Allen, whose
' sympathetic accompaniment helped
us a great deal."
