### 
LONDON, Jan. 27. (/Piâ€”A politi
cal battle which may end possibly
in the downfall of the Labor govern
j ment began in the House of Com
! mons this afternoon with discussion
of Stanley Baldwin's motion to re
ject the bitterly contested Trades
Disputes bill.
The final division will be taken
i late tomorrow evening and the gen
eral opinion in the House was that
the Government would be victorious
by a small majority.
Most of the Liberals decided yes
! terday to abstain from voting on the
measure, thus leaving the decision
to a straight Labor-Conservative
fight with the advantage on the side
I of the Government.
