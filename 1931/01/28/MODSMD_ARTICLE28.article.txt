WASHINGTON, Jan. 27. f/P)—The
Western Pacific Railroad was given
permission today by the Interstate
Commerce Commission to build its
5 own all-rail entrance into San
Francisco, by construction of a new
line from Niles via lTcdwood City to
Quint Street, within the municipal
! limits.
Need For Line Seen
I In granting the approval the com
mission said that there had been an
"impressive showing of the West
ern Pacific's need for an all-rail
! entrance into San Francisco," as
well as a clear indication of the de
sirability of furnish competitive rail
service to the industrial arpa of San
Francisco. It reviewed the previous
' steps taken by the Great Northern
and the Western Pacific by which a
| completely new railroad will be ex-
I tended down from Klamath Falls in
Oregon to a connection with the
Western Pacific-San Francisco line.
Bridge Usage Needed
As a further detail of the San
Francisco entrance, the Western.
Pacific also was authorized to ac
quire a one-third interest in the
! Quint Street line, a short terminal
system in San Francisco now jointly
controlled by the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe.
The negotiations with the South
ern Pacific over the Dumbarton
bridge usage may be opened imme
j diately, the decision said, and the
I result reported to the commission.
If the Western Pacific fails to obtain
■ the bridge right it will construct 39
i miles of new line, but if a common
i use agreement is made the actual
I construction will be cut to 25 miles.
