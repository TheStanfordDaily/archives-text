TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. B.v Louis
Bromfield. New York, PKIO. (At
tlie Stanford Bookstore.)
Metallic brilliance in the early
chapters give a promise of enter
tainment from this book that the
later chapters are far from fulfilling.
Bromfield has gone modern and the
result is depressing. The book is
unhealthy, and -grubby, and leaves
one with the feeling that he has
been over-dosed with Freud and
Eugene O'Neill.
The title, "Twenty-Four Hours,"
is derived from the peculiar struc
ture and setting of the plot. All the
action takes place in the span of u
i single twenty-four hours, beginning
with an elaborate dinner party at
which most of the characters in
cluded in the book are introduced
to the readers.. Such a plot is more
suited to a ' mystery or detective
"spell-binder" than to the refined
and sophisticated pen of Louis
Bromfield, apparently, for about
half-way through his story he finds
1 himself in a labyrinth from which
there is no logical nor convincing
escape. The one which he finally in
vents would do credit to "True
Confessions." It is more than a little
incongruous to have such incredibly
trite and sentimental incidents as
the melodramatic strangling of
Rosie, a "Night Club Queen" of the
most typical sort, by her jealous and
worthless husband described intri
| cately—and messily—by one of the
oustanding novelists of today.
; "Twenty-Four Hours" is not a
; pleasant book to read, in short.
—M. L. R.
BETWEEN TIIE LINES. By 11. M.
Tomlinson. Harvard University
Press. 1930.
H. M. Tomlinson made a good
■ speech. It was so very good he was
| induced to deliver it at Princeton,
i Yale, D'Youville, Cornell, Colum
j bia, and Harvard.
"Between the Lines" tries to dis
cover the machinery of literary
| creation. The Ibsenesque regard for
j truth that Tomlinson displays
j meshes with his belief that a zeal
; for truth is the spring of art. Sin

cerity is the first essential to ex
cellence in literature and literary
expression.
He proceeds upon the principle
that religion and literature are in
separable, that in the best of poetry,
as in music, man is a bit above
himself.
"The Second Conrad" does not
try to codify his convictions. He is
quite aware truth is a vague thing,
that "literature is an expression of
fundamental life . . . and an in
dication of national health." He ar
gues well that whoever will not
courageously face the facts of life,
whether he likes them or not, will
never be able to tell the true from
the false in literature.
In his despair of modern letters
he prayerfully concludes that "some
day the ugliness which is supreme
shall be laid low." —B. P.
GYSPY ADAIR—At the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.
Impudent as ever and several
pounds lighter, the perennial Mitzi
Ilajos appears in Myron C. Fagan's
comedy. It takes a good entertainer
to knock a first-night audience out
of their seats, but Mitzi did it; she
kept everyone in an uproar with
her winks and tricks, including the
cast.
Ordinary spoken comedy is not
enough for Mitzi, so she sings a song
now and then, putting them across
in her dwn little way, making com
edy which equals Chevalier's sing
ing. Probably the best proof of
Mitzi's ability that can be given—
outside of seeing her performance
yourself—is that none of her suc
cess depends on s-e-x appeal.
Of course, there is a bedroom cli
max in the la>t act in which our
heroine, Mitzi, retires for the night
with the leading man, Herbert Clark,
but that is to be excused when you
learn that they were secretly mar
ried a week ago. Not risque at all.
Franklin Parker, as the hero's pal,
and Davison Clark, his uncle, are
very good. So is Carlotta Madden, a
revealing figure in riding habit or
love plot. The others are somewhat
weak, but Mitzi makes that up.

Impudent as ever and several
pounds lighter, the perennial Mitzi
Ilajos appears in Myron C. Fagan's
comedy. It takes a good entertainer
to knock a first-night audience out
of their seats, but Mitzi did it; she
kept everyone in an uproar with
her winks and tricks, including the
cast.
Ordinary spoken comedy is not
enough for Mitzi, so she sings a song
now and then, putting them across
in her dwn little way, making com
edy which equals Chevalier's sing
ing. Probably the best proof of
Mitzi's ability that can be given—
outside of seeing her performance
yourself—is that none of her suc
cess depends on s-e-x appeal.
Of course, there is a bedroom cli
max in the la>t act in which our
heroine, Mitzi, retires for the night
with the leading man, Herbert Clark,
but that is to be excused when you
learn that they were secretly mar
ried a week ago. Not risque at all.
Franklin Parker, as the hero's pal,
and Davison Clark, his uncle, are
very good. So is Carlotta Madden, a
revealing figure in riding habit or
love plot. The others are somewhat
weak, but Mitzi makes that up.

TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. B.v Louis
Bromfield. New York, PKIO. (At
tlie Stanford Bookstore.)
Metallic brilliance in the early
chapters give a promise of enter
tainment from this book that the
later chapters are far from fulfilling.
Bromfield has gone modern and the
result is depressing. The book is
unhealthy, and -grubby, and leaves
one with the feeling that he has
been over-dosed with Freud and
Eugene O'Neill.
The title, "Twenty-Four Hours,"
is derived from the peculiar struc
ture and setting of the plot. All the
action takes place in the span of u
i single twenty-four hours, beginning
with an elaborate dinner party at
which most of the characters in
cluded in the book are introduced
to the readers.. Such a plot is more
suited to a ' mystery or detective
"spell-binder" than to the refined
and sophisticated pen of Louis
Bromfield, apparently, for about
half-way through his story he finds
1 himself in a labyrinth from which
there is no logical nor convincing
escape. The one which he finally in
vents would do credit to "True
Confessions." It is more than a little
incongruous to have such incredibly
trite and sentimental incidents as
the melodramatic strangling of
Rosie, a "Night Club Queen" of the
most typical sort, by her jealous and
worthless husband described intri
| cately—and messily—by one of the
oustanding novelists of today.
; "Twenty-Four Hours" is not a

Of course, there is a bedroom cli
max in the la>t act in which our
heroine, Mitzi, retires for the night
with the leading man, Herbert Clark,
but that is to be excused when you
learn that they were secretly mar
ried a week ago. Not risque at all.
Franklin Parker, as the hero's pal,
and Davison Clark, his uncle, are
very good. So is Carlotta Madden, a
revealing figure in riding habit or
love plot. The others are somewhat
weak, but Mitzi makes that up.
