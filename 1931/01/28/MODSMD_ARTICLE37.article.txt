What with the sap running j
(meaning that it's Spring) and the I
Spirit of Sport running rife, we've !
another athletic activity to present j
for your inspection and approval. ]
What about a few block letters to ;
be distributed cautiously among the
stalwart crew of Robleans, fresh and j
sponsors, who take a constitutional 1
bicycle ride around the Quad each
evening, to develop appetite?

And in the midst of basketball
season, the good old problem of
subsidized athletes stares us in
the face, again.
It is rumored that certain athletes j
in this University are having all tui- j
tion and expenses paid by their par- j
er.ts, and also that many of them
have worked for money during sum
mer vacations. Such jobs as pump- ,
ing gasoline, driving trucks, and i
paddling canoes are considered pro- j
fessional because the athlete uses J
his athletic ability for gain.
Furthermore, it is pretty well
confirmed that great numbers of
athletes have had their expenses
paid during the last few years
while traveling to and from
games and track meets.
It is not only in athletics that
professionalism is rife. See, for in- '

| stance, the professional professor,
professional eaters, sleepers, snakes, ,
professional dumbells and
polishers.
Professional gum-chewers and !
professional tanks are listed in an
other paragraph.
We have inside information
that the sensational Mr. Faw
cett, of the Indian five, played
tag for three minutes when he
was six years old, and then re
reived five cents from his uncle,
to buy candy.
Is queening a profession, a habit, J
or an affliction?
Does an athlete receiving a letter
containing u two-cent stamp, from
his best girl, constitute professional
ism?
Why not declare everybody
ineligible to study?
It is rumored that any athlete re- !
ceiving a nickel in dhange for the I
quarter paid for a choc malt will 1
be declared a professional.
Many athletes have been induced ;
to come to Stanford by offers of free I
speech and free blank checks.
If using professional skill for
gain is professionalism, what
about the Jolly-Ups?
Yes, we sometimes wonder . . . . |
