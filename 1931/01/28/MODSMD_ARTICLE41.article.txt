The Editor, Sir;
The students admitted to Stanford
are a select group as per Professor
Robinson. They are scholastically,
morally, spiritually, and leaderly
1 the elite men and women of the
country.
As soon as they cross the throsh
j old the Administration says, "Chil
dren, GRADES AND HONOR
| POINTS ARE THE GOD HERE.
1 The honor code is an institution in
this University, but we do not trust
you; consequently during an exam
ination refrain from using outside
i aid, occupy alternate seats, and to
I enforce this, each of you must spy
| on your fellow student."
Adds Injury to Insult
That was and is an insult. But
i now, the honorable executive com
' mittee of the Associated Students
adds injury to the prevailing insult:
(1) That no written work to be
| used as a basis for GRADES be
| corrected unless there be appended
' a personally written and signed
! pledge, as follows: "I hereby certify
1 ON MY HONOR that I have neither
i given nor received aid in this test
| (report or examination)."
(2) That all faculty members be
requested to remind their classes
before each examination, quiz, or re
port assignment that the HONOR
; CODE is an institution at Stanford
I and that students are expected to
j conduct themselves accordingly by
! doing their own work unaided, and
by giving no help to others.
Concept of Honor
! That, Sir, is the administration's
! and Executive Committee's concept
' of HONOR. It is bad enough to
make cheaters out of the students
i without making them hypocrites.
Webster says, "HONOR, A NICE
' SENSE OF WHAT IS RIGHT, JUST,
AND TRUE, WITH STRICT CON
FORMITY THERETO. Sir, contrast
the two, and decide for ypurself
which constitutes HONOR, and
which constitutes HYPOCRISY.
Instead of the administration and
the Executive Committee formulat
ing KINDERGARTEN RULES TO
i ENFORCE THE SO-CALLED HON
OR CODE, THEY SHOULD RE
, MOVE THE CAUSE. GRADES!â€”
' HONOR POINTS!! are so insuffi
! cient as an indication of a student's
knowledge and ability that only a
feebleminded individual could un
resentfully accept them.
Do They Doubt?
If the honorable University lead
ers doubt, let them recall the re
cent action of Johns Hopkins; let
I them recall the contempt which the
' famous centers of learning in Europe
hold for the American universities
, and their GRAMMAR SCHOOL
METHODS.
Since the PLUS-MINUS system

.has functioned so wonderfully in
| other higher educational institutions
i and in certain courses in this Uni
versity, why not ADOPT IT AS A
WHOLE and as a prelude to the de-
I veloping independent study plan.
Then THE STUDENT WILL COM
PARE ONLY WITH HIMSELF, OR
HERSELF, AND WILL LEARN TO
' STUDY AND THINK, RATHER
I THAN SCHEME, MANOEUVER,
j AND APPLE-POLISH FOR CON
j TEMPTIBLE GRADES AND HON
OR POINTS. The over-taxed Execu
! tive Committee in working to
ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS RATH
ER THAN THE CAUSE reminds
! one very much of the IGNORANT
INDIVIDUALS WHO RELIGIOUS
tLY GULP DOWN DOSES OF
I "HEADACHE POWDERS" SOLD
1 TO THEM BY QUACKS.
Enforce Honor?
Breaches of our SO-CALLED
| HONOR CODE, like the violations
!of that certain amendment to our
j national constitution, make crime a
case of being caught, and PROVES
1 THAT HONOR CAN NOT BE EN
FORCED.
SINCE THE ADMINISTRATION
! AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
DO NOT HAVE FAITH IN, AND
; RESPECT FOR, THE SO-CALLED
HONOR CODE, THEY CAN NOT
1 EXPECT SUCH FROM THE STU
DENTS .
Therefore, let us eliminate, (1)
i GRADES AND HONOR POINTS,
(2) THAT KINDERGARTEN RE
MINDER OF CONDUCT ON THE
EXAMINATION BOOKS, (3) THE
, RECENT PROPOSALS OF THE
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, (4)
FORCE, and substitute in their
| places, (1) THE PLUS-MINUS
SYSTEM WHICH WILL MAKE
I STANFORD THE SEAT OF CUL
TURE INSEAD OF THE SEAT OF
! DISHONESTY AS PORTRAYED;
i (2) FAITH IN STANFORD'S ABIL
| ITY TO SELECT AND ADMIT
! MEN AND WOMEN IN WHOM
HONOR IS A TRAIT INNATE.
