# LOOKING AROUND

### Abe Mellinkoff 
The University of North Dakota is
planning a hall of fame for promi
nent students of their campus. In it
! will go Phi Beta Kappas who made
i the varsity and any varsity man that
i could make two Kappas.
The editor of the U.C.L.A.
Daily Bruin claims that grades
and activities do not go to
gether. That may account for
U.C.L.A.'s high scholastic stand-
I iiigâ€”and her football teams.
Sororities at the University of
Oregon are to present programs
over the student-owned radio
station. Rushing takes to the air!
The dean of women at the Uni
versity of Minnesota has proposed a
time clock for co-eds going out on
dates. The device would indicate
1 when the co-ed left and when she
returned. There would also be a
space to place the name of the fel
low, the occasion, and other desired
information.
That surely is putting date
making on a business basis.
Soon they will be mounting
automatic sound cameras in the
boy-friend's car to have a still
more adequate check on the
co-eds.
It is claimed at Pennsylvania State
College that stopping subsidization
increases the caliber of their athletic
1 teams. The Ancient and Royal Order
of College Fullbacks will be forced
| to stop such statements or soon they
will be back on the ice-wagons from
whence they came.
| Ohio Slate College has 17 libraries
on the campus. But the book you
want is always out, lost, or just
being ordered whether there is one
or one hundred book depositaries.
Clammy hands, the death knell to
the politician, can be cured by a
minor operation, according to dis
, coveries just completed at the Uni
, versity of Kansas.
That is indeed a wonderful
contribution to modern civiliza
tion; but the man who invents
a way to prevent "glad-banders''
from squeezing a normal hand
i into a lump of mashed bones and
twisted skin will have the uni
versal praise of suffering man
! kind.
