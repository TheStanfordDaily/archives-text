Once again the Stanford rnitt
slingers will gather in the ring to
morrow night to do battle for the
Tunney medals, the University
championships, and their places on
the varsity boxing team. And once
again Harry Maloney's charges will
put on a show well worth seeing.
Boxing at Stanford, in spite
of the severe handicaps it has
had to overcome, will always
remain dear to the hearts of
loyal sons of Stanford lied. Not
only because the presence of
Harry Maloney at the helm
guarantees a spirit of sports
manship, but also because of
the appeal of the game itself, the
manly art of self-defense at
tracts a crowd.
For the past few years, at least,
Harry Maloney has had but a hand
ful of men to work with in the
boxing gallery. In spite of the short
age of material, Maloney has gone
his way, uncomplaining, and has en
deavored to make up for the dearth
of men by his own unceasing ef
forts to train the available timber.
This year it is the same story.
lii the heavy divisions, good ma
terial is conspicuous—by its ab
sence. It is a miraculous season
which finds a Stanford boxing
team with even two dependable
performers in every division,
and with injuries apt to cripple
the squad, it is a wonder Ma
loney is able to sleep nights.
But tomorrow night fans will be
able to see for themselves what is
available in the squared circle. With
the medals donated by Gene Tun
ney awards well worth having, the
boys are certain to give their best
in an effort to win. Following the
all-University tilts, the boxing team
will meet Nevada here on the week
following.
Stanford crowds have been
fairly well-behaved at past tour
naments. With the feeling of
fight in the air when the men
start mixing it, a crowd may
easily lose its head, but the stu
dents have in the past remained
sportsmen. After ail. it is not a
professional exhibition which
they have come to see, and they
arc not prone to scream for gore.
Several experienced men will
crawl through the ropes tomorrow
night. Spectators wili do well to
watch the work of Captain Fred
Johnson, Vance Rogers, Fred Glover,
Hugh Keenan, Yuji Imai, and others,
for they will be wearing Stanford's
colors in the intercollegiate clashes
to come.
During the past season, the
liedshirts broke even with Cali
fornia in the ring. Since this
seems to be a big Red year in
athletics, at least as far as Cali
fornia is concerned, the boxing
team will be out to continue the
Cardinal winning streak against
the Rears. llow much chance
they have will be determined in
the Pavilion, so we'll see you

Boxing at Stanford, in spite
of the severe handicaps it has
had to overcome, will always
remain dear to the hearts of
loyal sons of Stanford lied. Not
only because the presence of
Harry Maloney at the helm
guarantees a spirit of sports
manship, but also because of
the appeal of the game itself, the
manly art of self-defense at
tracts a crowd.
For the past few years, at least,
Harry Maloney has had but a hand
ful of men to work with in the
boxing gallery. In spite of the short
age of material, Maloney has gone
his way, uncomplaining, and has en
deavored to make up for the dearth
of men by his own unceasing ef
forts to train the available timber.
This year it is the same story.
lii the heavy divisions, good ma
terial is conspicuous—by its ab
sence. It is a miraculous season
which finds a Stanford boxing
team with even two dependable
performers in every division,
and with injuries apt to cripple
the squad, it is a wonder Ma
loney is able to sleep nights.
But tomorrow night fans will be
able to see for themselves what is
available in the squared circle. With
the medals donated by Gene Tun
ney awards well worth having, the
boys are certain to give their best
in an effort to win. Following the
all-University tilts, the boxing team
will meet Nevada here on the week
following.
Stanford crowds have been
fairly well-behaved at past tour
naments. With the feeling of
fight in the air when the men
start mixing it, a crowd may
easily lose its head, but the stu
dents have in the past remained
sportsmen. After ail. it is not a
professional exhibition which
they have come to see, and they
arc not prone to scream for gore.
Several experienced men will
crawl through the ropes tomorrow
night. Spectators wili do well to
watch the work of Captain Fred
Johnson, Vance Rogers, Fred Glover,
Hugh Keenan, Yuji Imai, and others,
for they will be wearing Stanford's
colors in the intercollegiate clashes
to come.
During the past season, the
liedshirts broke even with Cali
fornia in the ring. Since this
seems to be a big Red year in
athletics, at least as far as Cali
fornia is concerned, the boxing
team will be out to continue the
Cardinal winning streak against
the Rears. llow much chance
they have will be determined in
the Pavilion, so we'll see you
at the all-University fisticuffs!

Once again the Stanford rnitt
slingers will gather in the ring to
morrow night to do battle for the
Tunney medals, the University
championships, and their places on
the varsity boxing team. And once
again Harry Maloney's charges will
put on a show well worth seeing.
