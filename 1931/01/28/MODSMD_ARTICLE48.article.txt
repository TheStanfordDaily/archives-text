j Taking the floor in a fighting mood,

' Smith and Topping were both kept
'■ on the sidelines by injuries.
Packard drew first blood when he
; sank two free throws, and shortly
1 after dropped in a field goal to give
J the frosh a 4 to 0 lead. Three suc
i cessive field goals by Carniglia, Blak

Frosh Lead at Half
The second period saw the fresh
! men make their best stand of the
; evening, the scoreboard reading 15
|to 8 in Stanford's favor when the
! teams left the floor. Maentz, Massey,
j and Packard went on.a spree, ac
j counting for four field goals and
I three free throws .in this quarter.
; Close guarding by Galileo in the
| third period .prevented the frosh
| from scoring a single field goal, but
i also gave them opportunity to ac
i count for four tallies via the free
j throw route.
Many fouls were committed by
iboth fives in the hectic quarter, and
J Packard was forced out of the game
j with four personals near its close.

j parent in the final quarter, when a
j desperate closing rally by Galileo
j very nearly snatched the game from
j the fire.
j Stanford was held to but a single
! foul shot, by Maentz, while the preps
j piled up seven tallies. The gun was
| fired as Doyle tanked a difficult shot,
and had play continued another min

; been reversed.
j Packard was high point man for
i the frosh, with nine tallies. Maentz
! accounted for six and Massey four.
I Doyle led the preps with five points,
I Kurtela trailing with four.
