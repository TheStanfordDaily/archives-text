# PRELIMINARY TENNIS SHOWING INDICATES GOOD FROSH SEASON
## 
### 
Led by Chuck Otis, from Pasadena
Junior College, the freshman tennis
squad may be expected this year to
at least uphold the reputation of
former yearling outfits.
A preliminary tournament, to de
termine roughly the standing of
squad members, has been played off,
although the provisional ranking
matches have not yet been com
pleted.
Among the outstanding players
are: Monte Shwayder, from Lowell
High, San Francisco; Dan Ellis, from
Tamalpais School, San Rafael; A1
Bogan, from Webb School of Cali
fornia; Jim Sheahan, Dean School,
Santa Barbara; Norman Wright,
Tamalpais School; Phil Kneisley,
Fairfax High, Hollywood; Alden
Sadler, John Muir Technical High,
Pasadena; and Kelley Thorpe, Van
Nuys High.
While the freshman schedule has
not yet been completed, it is known
that U.S.C., always a strong aggre
gation, will not be on the list.
