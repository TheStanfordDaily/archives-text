# INJURED THUMB TO KEEP TOPPING OFF FROSH FIVE
## 
### 
INJURIES having already
robbed the freshman hoop
team of its best guard. Smith,
yesterday plucked Topping
from the quintet.
X-ray photographs revealed
that Topping's thumb, injured
in the California game, was
broken. This deprives Coach
John Burin of his two steadiest
players on the squad.
Smith is out for the season,
and Topping will not be able
to rejoin the squad for at least
a week or two.
Wright started at guard in
place of Smith in the Galileo
game last night, and Maentz
was at Topping's forward post.
