# TRACKMEN RUN GOOD PRACTICE TIMES ON OVAL
## Les 						Hables lakes Dashes; Nisbet Wins Hurdles; Track Is Slow 
### 
Practice competition in the track
events was the order of yesterday's
workout at the varsity oval. Al
though the running track is still a
little loose and slow, times turned
in by Coach "Dink"' Templeton's
runners were good for early season
competition.
Les Hables and Lombardi finished
in that order in both the century
and 220-yard sprints. Dyer, who is
getting his first real workouts of
the season this week, took third in
the 100. Willson, star freshman run
ner, finished just behind the leaders.
Eastman Takes 440
Eastman, sophomore middle-dis
tance man, after getting off to a
slow start, nosed out Shove in the
quarter. Howell and Ike Hables
came in third and fourth. In a (560-
yard race Cooper, Storms, and
Brown finished in that order.
Nisbet broke the tape just ahead
of Smith in the high hurdles, with
Herbert, a sophomore who has been
working on the low barriers this
season, in third place. Nisbet was
also out in front at the end of the
220-yard low hurdles.
Lyman, freshman weight man
from Santa Monica, has been show
ing remarkable promise in the shot
put. During a recent practice he
tossed the 16-pound ball out to the
48-foot chalk line, a distance not
far short of the Little Big Meet
record.
