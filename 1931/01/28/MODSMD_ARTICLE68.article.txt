# VARSITY NINE PLAYS OLYMPIC CLUBMEN IN GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball varsity will
open its 1931 season Saturday after
noon when they encounter the
Olympic Club in a practice game
at 2:30 o'clock on the new local
diamond.
In the two tilts of last year with
the Winged "O," the Indians came
off second best to the tune of 13-7,
and 5-3. Harry Wolter's boys are
looking forward to securing a re
venge over the Clubmen, and indi
cations, from the practice which has
been going on since the beginning
of the quarter, point to a hard strug
gle.
Neither team has released its
starting line-up as yet. However it
has been the custom of Harry Wol
ter to give every man on the Stan
ford squad a chance to play for an
inning or so during these first prac
tice tilts.
