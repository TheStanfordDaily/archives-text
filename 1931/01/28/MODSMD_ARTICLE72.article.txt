# KELLEY SPEAKS ON ACHIEVEMENTS OF MODERN SCIENCE
## 
### 
The story of colossal arches, city
skyscrapers, miles of pavement and
gigantic dams, lay behind a lecture
j on "Research in Concrete," given by
K. A. Kelley of the Portland Cement
Association at 4:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon in the Little Theatre.
Ilustrating with lantern slides of
the Portland laboratories, Kelley
showed how blocks of concrete are
bility, and reaction to fire, upon
which factors the whole structure of
modern architecture rests.
"In this day of professional compe
tition," he said, "it is not enough to
learn what has been done. The en
gineer must pay constant attention
to practical research."
Thirty thousand scientists are
conducting research for great indus
tries today, at an annual expendi
ture of $200,000,000, according to
Kelley's report.
