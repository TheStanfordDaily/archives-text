# MACDONALD TO HOLD WEAVERS' MEDIATION
## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 27 (/P.). â€” Prime
Minister Mac Donald took a hand to
day in the industrial difficulties of
the Lancashire cotton textile indus
try, where nearly a quarter of a mil
lion weavers have been locked out
because they refused to agree to the
inauguration of the so-called more
looms per weaver system.
He invited representatives of both
sides to lay their grievances before
him on Thursday, and it was hoped
that this effort at meditation would
be more successful than the govern
ment's previous attempts to inter
vene.
