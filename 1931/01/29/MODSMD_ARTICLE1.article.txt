# BUNN BELIEVES U.C.L.A. GAME TO BE CRUCIAL
## Score Of Last Bruin Meet Will Influence Final Coast Standing RESERVES LOOK GOOD 
### Stewart Crawford 
The crucial game of the Coast
Conference race.
That is what Coach Bunn has
termed the third tilt of the Stanford-
U.C.L.A. series which is scheduled
for the Pavilion Saturday night.
The result of this contest, Bunn
believes, will make a great differ
ence in just which of the four posi
tions the Indians will be occupying
in the Coast Conference standings
at the end of the 1931 court season.
Victory Needed
If his team can win over an outfit
which already holds two victories
over Stanford, he is confident that
the chances of the Cardinals for
coming out victorious in the re
maining California and Trojan tilts
will be considerably boosted.
With this in mind, the cage coach
in yesterday's workout began a
week of strenuous practice, and in
tends to have his men at their peak
of l'orm for Saturday night's en
counter.
Reserves Are Good
That Stanford's reserve strength
leaves nothing to be desired was
evident in Tuesday night's fracas
against the Olympic Club quintet
when the second-stringers held a
strong club five to a 33-33 deadlock
in 40 minutes of hard basketball.
"I was very well satisfied with
the showing of the reserves," Bunn
said last night, "especially the per
formances turned in by Bill Doub,
Don Tyler, Phil Baker, and Reggie
Mead."
The coach explained that he had
intended to keep the varsity five on
the bench throughout the game so
they could be at their very best for
the Bruins. He decided to send them
in for the overtime period, how
ever, though he realized that with
out a chance to warm up, they were
at a disadvantage.
Except for Fawcett's foul and the
moment when Schuppert set himself
to toss in an exceptionally long one,
Bunn believes that his men showed
a marked superiority over the club
men in the matter of teamwork.
