## 
### 
With only one experienced man
on hand, prospects for a successful
freshman fencing season are not en
couraging.
Despite the large number of first
year men who are out for the team
only one, Richard Criley, ha§ had
previous competitive experience.
Criley fenced in France before com
ing to the Farm and is expected to
carry the brunt of this year's ac
tivities for the squad.
Fred PeaiTnan, varsity fencer, has
been working with the new men for
the past two quarters and hopes
that by tho time the annual fresh
man encounter with California takes
placc two or three more promising
men will be uncovered.
The frosh squad this year is going
to find it doubly hard to defeat the
Berkeley babes, and also to live up
to the record made by last seas'on's
freshmen. The team last year de
feated California 18 to 7, with two
of the men winning all of their
bouts.
Several of the varsity squad are
participating tomorrow night at the
Olympic Club in an open foils con
test, in which well-known fencers
