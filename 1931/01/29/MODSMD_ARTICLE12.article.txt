# Red Cross Refuses To Take Charge Of Senate Relief Fund
## Robinson Says Congress Will Find Own Agencies For Distribution of the Appropriations Which Are Proposed by the Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28. (/P) —A threat that Congress would find its own
relief agencies came today in answer to a flat refusal by the Red
Cross to administer the $25,000,000 relief fund proposed in the Senate.
Democratic Leader Robinson told the Senate Congress would find its
own agencies for distribution of such funds as it feels should be used in
the emergency "if the Red Cross refuses to measure up to the proper
standard." Robinson was speaking in reply to testimony John Barton
Payne, chairman of the Red Cross, had given the House Appropriations
Committee. Payne said his organization could not accept administration

of the fund. He presented a rcsolu
lution adopted by the Red Cross
Central Committee.
The Arkansas Senator called on
all Senators who had even an "or
dinary" regard for suffering to "re
pudiate the policy which implies a
refusal on the part of those re
sponsible to the people as a whole to
take any action whatever to i-elieve
the distress."
Robinson said the $10,000,000 being
sought by the Red Cross was inade
quate, ■ threatened an extra session
if necessax - y to make Congress "do
its duty," and described the attitude
of President Hoover against the
$25,000,000 appropriation as "incom
prehensible" even to his closest
friends.
Red Cross Sole Rural Relief
"No organization but the Red
Cross," he said, "could give relief
in the rural areas."
He added, however, that the Red
Cross would destroy its private
sources of income if it went into
partnership with the Government.
Payne said the Robinson resolu
tion would necessitate the setting up
of Red Cross agencies in 400 cities
at great cost. Pie termed such a
course as "utterly impractical."
"It would duplicate the efforts of
organizations in cities which are
adequately caring for local condi
tions," Payne said.
