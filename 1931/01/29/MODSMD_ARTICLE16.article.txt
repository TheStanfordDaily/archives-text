# Mellon Advises Against Cashing Veteran Bonus
## Predicts Treasury Deficit; Fears Conversion 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (/I 5 ). —
Secretary Mellon told the Senate j
finance committee today that pro
posals for cashing the bonus certi
cates of World War veterans are i
I without "economic merit" and in- !
stead of improving conditions would 1
! "deepen" the world depression.
Mellon was closely questioned as
: he predicted a treasury deficit of
$375,000,000 and warned the cash
convex - sion plan would not only have
! "serious consequences" on public,
credit but would "greatly disturb
world equilibrium."
Harrison Asks Relief
The veteran treasury secretary had
barely concluded his statement of
the administration's opposition when
Senator Harrison, of Mississippi, a
; Democratic member of the commit- i
j tee, told the Senate "a majority of
' the committee is going to favor some j
relief."
j Harrison announced he favored j
paying the veterans the present cash
j value of their certificates.
Veto Possible
Mel lon's personal appearance was
! considered by committee members as
added evidence of the administra- I
I tion's strong attitude toward the pro- j
posed legislation. It increased the
j belief among some senators that j
President Hoover would veto a bill
to pay the veterans the face value
| of their certificates.
Mellon's prepared statement,
which was read to the committee by
Undersecretary Mills, confined its
! attack to the proposal for paying the j
face value of the certificates which
I would cost about $3,400,000,000.
