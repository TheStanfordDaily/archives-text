•MEXICO CITY. Jan. 27. lA't—Vir
tual abandonment of the Mexican i
navy probably will be one of the j
results of a request today by the
Treasury Department for a cut of
$22,500,000 in the federal budget for
the current year.
The request, which bears the ap
proval of President Ortiz Rubio, was !
made in view of a slump in cus
toms receipts and cancellation of a
number of government taxes.
One of the principal cuts is i
planned in the War iind Navy bud
get and officials are studying a pro
posal to begin slashing expenses by
abandoning the few old vessels that
make up the war fleet. They will |
be docked at various ports and left j
to rust, if the proposal is accepted. '
