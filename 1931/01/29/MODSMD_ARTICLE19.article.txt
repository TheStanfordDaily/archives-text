# Dyment Seeks Infirmary For Stanford Students
## 
### 
An entire floor of the new Palo j
Alto Hospital will be reserved as
an infirmary for Stanford students,
if Dr. Bertha Stuart Dyment, medi
cal adviser of women, gets her wish ,
in the matter.
The pressure of inadequate medi
cal facilities was evident last quar
ter, according to Dr. Dyment, when, ;
because the Palo Alto Hospital was
full, she was forced to send hospital
cases to the Women's Rest Home.
Rest Home Full
"The cramped situation of both
University medical units can be re- |
lieved by the establishment of the
proposed infirmary, with 24-hour
emergency service, and use of the i
hospital diagnostic laboratory, said '

Dr. Dyment. "The latter two can be
part of the regular hospital equip
ment, used intermittently and at no
great expense by Stanford.
Fees Gratified
"Stanford women get their
money's worth from medical fees,
but despite this, we need the in
firmary. In no university is the in
firmary entirely financed by student
fees."
Last quarter 2150 treatments were
given by Dr. Dyrnent's office to the
500 women students, including con
sultations, basal metabolism tests,
and treatments for colds, infections,
and injuries. Recently installed
equipment ihcuudos ultra-violet ray
lamp, vibrator, and zoalite lamps.
