# GANDHI SPEEDS TO ALLAHABAD HEADQUARTERS
## Leaves Word To Followers To Continue Struggle Against British 
### 
BOMBAY, Jan. 28. (/P)—-Leaving
behind him a mesage to India's Na
tionalist millions that their fight for
independence must go on, Mahatma
Gandhi today speeded by train to
ward Allahabad, central Indian city,
where are gathered most of the Na
tionalist working committee.
At Allahabad, India's "City of
God," located on the sacred Ganges,
he will visit the bedside of one of
his dearest friends, the aged Pandit
Motilal Nehru, father of Jawaharlal
Nehru, president of the All India
National Congress, and discuss with
him Britain's offer of an eventual
qualified dominion status for India.
Welcome Waiting
He faces in Allahabad, when he
arrives there tonight, a welcome
probably as enthusiastic and fren
zied as that which tens and hun
dreds of thousands gave him here
yesterday upon his ai'ival from eight
months in Yeroda prison. In the
crush which centered about his frail
96-pound body one woman was
trampled to death and 31 persons
were sent to hospitals.
"We can suspend judgment on
Prime Minister Mac Donald's state
ment to the round table conference
at London," he declared just before
departing from Bombay, "but we
cannot suspend the activities of the
All-India National Congress (the
organization which has sponsored
the Nationalist civil disobedience
movement).
Conference Planned
"Even if after our conference with
the delegates coming home from the
round table conference it is found
that the Prime Minister's statement
affords sufficient ground for the
congress to suspend its non-co-oper
ation movement, the party cannot
abandon its right to picket liquor
shops and drug shops and those
selling cloth, nor can the right of
India's starving millions to make
their own salt be given up."
