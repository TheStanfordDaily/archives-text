•MARVELL, Ark., Jan. 28. (/P>—
One meal a clay, consisting usually
of bread and molasses and perhaps
beans or plain salt pork, is what
the average drought sufferer's fam
ily gets out of what the Red Cross
gives him.
"But wje're thankful to get that
because it keeps us from starving,"
said Jacob Miller, a negro tenant
farmer and life-long resident of this
community. "About all it does is
keep us alive though."
Miller's case is typical of that of
most of the tenant farmers of this
and other counties—whites and ne
groes alike.
He has a wife and two children
and has been receiving food from
the Red Cross for three weeks. It
amounts to about $5 a month.
"We eat one meal a day,"he said.
"If we tried to get more than that
out of the food we get, it wouldn't
last two weeks."
The food is allotted every two
weeks.
