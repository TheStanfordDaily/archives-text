# BOXING'S CRUCIAL PERIOD
## 
### 
( ampus leatherpushcrs will gather in the Pavilion tonight to
battle for the I niversity championships, the 'l'linney medals, and
probable positions on the varsity boxing squad. Stanford's chances
in the coining intercollegiate tournaments will depend largely on*the
talent that turns out for the title bouts.
I'oxing at Stanford has deteriorated during the past few years
because of the type of men reporting for the sport and the lack of
interest among those capable of making the squad. Uecause of the
super-human efforts of Coach Harry Maloney, Stanford has been
able to hold its head up in intercollegiate competition so far.
1 low ever, this year is the'crucial period as far as boxing is con
cerned. If the proper material is not forthcoming, boxing may be
discontinued because it would be detrimental to the best interests of
the sport to match experienced mitt-men against inexperienced
boxers, bate of boxing at Stanford depends upon the showing to
night and the results of afternoons of practice in the boxing gallery
before the intercollegiate season opens.
