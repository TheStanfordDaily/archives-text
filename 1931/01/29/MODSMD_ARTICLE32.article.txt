Under the heading "We Don't P.lame Stanford for Refusing
To Ue Made Into a Super Junior College,'' the Daily Califnniiaii
gives its opinion of restrictions against the Lower Division and the
encouragement of junior college graduates to enter Stanford. Al
though the Califorii'ntii is known for its stand against junior col
leges, its comment is interesting to every Stanford student. The
entire editorial follows:
" Vccording to current reports, acting President Robert E. Swain,
Washington leased wire administrator of the 'farm,' has released a
program for the expenditure of the $100,000 present that was neatly
handed over by the (ieneral Kducation board some days ago. "His
ideas are enough to rile the most ardent friend of the University,
for indirectly they aim at the disintegration of the two lower classes
at Stanford.
"The gift was gratefully received until President Swain indi
cated that the funds would be used to adapt the present upper-divi
sion to the needs of junior college transfers. Mis plan further
arouses righteous antagonism by inferring restrictions on the lower
division.
"The pre-Wilbur generation of alumni may well become worried
over ibis recent turn of affairs. Those who grew up in the warmth
and congeniality of the Jordan administration have ample cause for
alarm over the permanence of the old four-year curriculum which
was free from restrictions, and in the words of Senator Stanford
'aimed for personal success and direct usefulness in life.'
"Although traditions are not always the most useful assets of
a universitv, "it is not pleasant to see them go by the board in so
wholesale a manner. The old alumni may not approve of sending
their boys to junior college in order to get them into Stanford. Per
haps the (Juad will not look so appealing in its new 'super junior
college* garb.
"To the students, the change is a little too drastic to accept.
Thev can visualize the gradual influx of junior collegians and junior
college ideas overthrowing the Stanford man and bis efforts in
athletics and activities. It is not pleasant to think of the day when
the life and vigor of the underclass shall ring through the 'dorms'
no longer: when fresh high school graduates shall filter through
the academic bars in decreasing number to receive the advice and
help, not of the thoroughbred Stanfordite, but of the half caste
junior collegian.
"If Swain stands behind his veiled assertions, it will mark the
final and complete perversion of the original purpose of the junior
college. What were originally designed to meet the need of men who
desired more than high school, but could not afford the time and
monev for the university, will become preparatory colleges for those
whose intellect has not enabled them to meet the requirements of a
university.
"If Stanford wishes to lower the bars of higher education; if
vhc wishes to neglect the needs of her own uppendassmen for those
of the junior colleges, let her go ahead with her substitute admini
strator's plan.
"However, it is a sorry state fit" affairs when a university which
is as old and as sound as Stanford must lay her head at the feet of
the untried junior college."
Rudy Yallec, who is reported to have been keeping that college
hoy's complexion on a diet that included grajiefruit, is now said to
be ratine miffed rice. You can't throw it.

entire editorial follows:
" Vccording to current reports, acting President Robert E. Swain,
Washington leased wire administrator of the 'farm,' has released a
program for the expenditure of the $100,000 present that was neatly
handed over by the (ieneral Kducation board some days ago. "His
ideas are enough to rile the most ardent friend of the University,
for indirectly they aim at the disintegration of the two lower classes
at Stanford.
"The gift was gratefully received until President Swain indi
cated that the funds would be used to adapt the present upper-divi
sion to the needs of junior college transfers. Mis plan further
arouses righteous antagonism by inferring restrictions on the lower
division.
"The pre-Wilbur generation of alumni may well become worried
over ibis recent turn of affairs. Those who grew up in the warmth
and congeniality of the Jordan administration have ample cause for
alarm over the permanence of the old four-year curriculum which
was free from restrictions, and in the words of Senator Stanford
'aimed for personal success and direct usefulness in life.'
"Although traditions are not always the most useful assets of
a universitv, "it is not pleasant to see them go by the board in so
wholesale a manner. The old alumni may not approve of sending
their boys to junior college in order to get them into Stanford. Per
haps the (Juad will not look so appealing in its new 'super junior
college* garb.
"To the students, the change is a little too drastic to accept.
Thev can visualize the gradual influx of junior collegians and junior
college ideas overthrowing the Stanford man and bis efforts in
athletics and activities. It is not pleasant to think of the day when
the life and vigor of the underclass shall ring through the 'dorms'
no longer: when fresh high school graduates shall filter through
the academic bars in decreasing number to receive the advice and
help, not of the thoroughbred Stanfordite, but of the half caste
junior collegian.
"If Swain stands behind his veiled assertions, it will mark the
final and complete perversion of the original purpose of the junior
college. What were originally designed to meet the need of men who
desired more than high school, but could not afford the time and
monev for the university, will become preparatory colleges for those
whose intellect has not enabled them to meet the requirements of a
university.
"If Stanford wishes to lower the bars of higher education; if
vhc wishes to neglect the needs of her own uppendassmen for those
of the junior colleges, let her go ahead with her substitute admini
strator's plan.
"However, it is a sorry state fit" affairs when a university which
is as old and as sound as Stanford must lay her head at the feet of
the untried junior college."
Rudy Yallec, who is reported to have been keeping that college
hoy's complexion on a diet that included grajiefruit, is now said to
be ratine miffed rice. You can't throw it.
Under the heading "We Don't P.lame Stanford for Refusing
To Ue Made Into a Super Junior College,'' the Daily Califnniiaii
gives its opinion of restrictions against the Lower Division and the
encouragement of junior college graduates to enter Stanford. Al
