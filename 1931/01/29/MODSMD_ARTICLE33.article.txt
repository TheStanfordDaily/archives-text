i "Egyptian Day is a reverent
| travel journal written by the author
i of "The Green Parrot."
Princesse Bibesco was led into
! Egypt and sober reflection by "that
1 dread goddess, pneumonia." She
s came back with two convictions;
I first, there is no such thing as lotus
in Egypt; second, the Egyptians have
| always worshipped a single god.
She hopes that her book will be
an inspiration to travel and not to
j reading more books, that it will
i vary from the formula of those vol
i umes "in which there is so much
1 discussion of nature that it is no
; longer necessary to go and look at
| it."
I Egypt, she says, is a badly slan
! dered nation, but adds with pleasure
j that "some of {lie best people in the
world are today making their apolo-
I gies to her as they kneel in the dust
; to solve her luminous riddles."
I Her active mind in constant touch
! with life considers death and its
I great monuments to find the resur
j rection older than the cross, the
; endless dawn-of day unquestionably
i assured. — B. P. '
; ONCE A SINN I ;R—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
With the advent of the talkies,
Hollywood began to take itself r.eri
| ously. The result, generally speak
ing, has been ghastly. The convic

| tion grows that the silver screen is
a once-upon-a-time medium.
"Once a Sinner" says the old
things in the old way. Once upon a
i time there was a beautiful girl who
I fell in love with a jealous boy. It
| took trouble to make their under
! standing complete, but after con
; siderable unhappiness they returned
i to each other's arms to live happily
i ever after.
Tho boy is an Horatio Alger suc
j cess. The girl is Dorothy Mackaiil.
| There is a Dully villain, and a lot
of whole-wheat sentimentality.
All in all, it's the sort of a picture
' one is slow to praise, isn't enraged
1 to attend, and that put exclusive
: shops on Hollywood Boulevard.
—B. P.
Is
TIIE MAN WIIO CAME BACK—At
I the Varsity Theatre.
It's a far cry from "Seventh
Heaven" to "The Man Who Came
| Back," and Fox might have chosen
i a better vehicle to again bring io
! gether Jane) Gaynor and Charles
; Kartell.
Fans of the popular co-stars will
| not be disappointed at their respec
tive performances, although many
J may feel that Miss Gaynor's role is
i too sordid for her.
The charming Janet does very
well, however, as a dope addict who
| finally rises from a Shanghai dive
i to health, wealth, happiness, etc.
The production has little to
| recommend it but the Gaynor-Far
' rell combination.
