## PANNING AN HONOR? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is unfortunate that, in a uni
versity with the reputation for en
lightenment enjoyed by Stanford, a
youth who is endeavoring in his
own humble way to make this world
a better place should be made the
subject of ridicule by the campus
"humorists."
I am referring to the very recent
case of the Chaparral versus Wil
liam N. Plymat, '34. The Chappies,
as the funny men designate them
selves, saw fit to poke fun at Mr.
Plymat because of his past and cur
rent activities on behalf of prohibi
tion.
The undersigned is not preparing
to open a discussion of the merits or
disadvantages of the nation's liquor
laws. But inasmuch as Mr. Plymat
has conducted in the University no
public campaign to save sinners
from alcohol, but has comported
himself in that respect like the or
dinary student, I believe he might
be spared the doubtful honor of
being "panned" by Chaparral. If
and when Mr. Plymat circulates
prohibition pamphlets about the
campus or harrangues young fresh
men from the Encina front steps,
then the Chappies may have some
thing approximating an excuse for
the tid-bit that appeared in their
last issue. Under the existing cir
cumstances, that tid-bit was simply
a display oÂ£ execrable taste.

which has yet appeared.
The succinct, clear, and ralher
complete treatment of the situation
calls for no additional remarks, ex
cept that too much emphasis cannot
be laid upon the contents of the
closing paragraph of that article; let
there be more effort concentrated
upon the selection of men and wo
men who have shown themselves to
possess a high degree of honor, as
well as showing promise of scholas
tic attainment.
Honesty in all of its aspects is
supposedly taught to the child in
the home and in the schools, and
should be a part of the individual's
character at the attainment of col
lege age. If the pre-college school
record should show this not to be
the case, then the acceptance of
such a candidate would be mani
festly dangerous to this kind of an
institution.
Universities are the centers of
higher intellectual pursuit and gen
eral culture. Certainly they should
be institutions which also set an
example of the highest honor, both
in methods of selection and in the
kind of men and women upon whom
they confer degrees.
M. Jameson's suggestions are feas
ible, and worth trying.
