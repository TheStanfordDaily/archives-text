## NETS 'N RACQUETS

Today's exhibition marks Mrs.
Helen Wills Moody's second appear
ance on the Stanford courts, and the
stands are certain to be jammed.
"Miss Poker Face" plays a fair game
of tennis, so scats will be scarce.
Just by the way, v/e warn members
of the student body to bring their
little tan cards along to prove that
they are Stanford students.
On Mrs. Moody's first appear
ance here, student body cards
were required to admit people
to the stands, much to the cha
grin ol' many. We remember that
I lie president of the Women's
Athletic Association had been
thoughtless enough to leave her
card behind that day, and after
much argument was barred from
the bleachers.
It remained for a freshman lass to
be the heroine. Coming in, she had
her card punched, circled the busy
B.A.C. copper, and dropped the card
to the unfortunate young lady. The
eyes of several score roughs fol
lowed Miss as she ascended
the stairs with the used card. But
the policeman was a gentleman, and
bravely punched another number,
amid the cheers of the multitude.
Mrs. Moody - won all of the
sets in which she took part on
that auspicious occasion, and
may do the same today. On the
whole, however, the Indians will
be able to put a far stronger
tennis team on the court this
year than was the case during
the 19,'J0 season, in spite of how
the Stanford varsity looks play
ing against the world's tennis
queen.
With Keith Glcdhill, Captain Ted
Easton, Harry Plymire, Joe Cough
lin, "Chuck" Wcesner, Phil Nieder
aur, and others displaying a win
ning species of net work, the Car
dinals should triumph over Cali
fornia's tennis team. And it would
bi j the first net victory for Stanford
since 1928.
We read in the Daily Califor
nian that some optimists are
already doping the Big Meet,
with California given a chance
to win by one point. If Stanford
does: not win that cinder combat
by at least 20 points—we were
going to say .'lO, but we'll save
that for later in the season—
Robert Lyman Templeton will
be grossly disappointed, along
with numerous other Redskins.
And so, conceding Stanford a win
in tennis and track, we come to the
third major sport of spring—base-
ball. Here the Bears can offer Little
Norman Horner, of axe and pitching
fame, for which no balm has been
found in the ranks of the Indian
nine. That chap has just been dyna
mite to the Cardinals, having won
SIX games—two series—from the
locals.
In view of his pitching, it is
too had the famous 21 did not
bring Horner back with them
too, and thus giving Harry Wel
ter's tribe an even break. But
this started out to be a tennis
yarn, so enough of baseball.
With Mrs. Moody will be Mrs.
L. A. Harper, herself a player
of international reputation, and
•Joe Coughlin. Aided by mem
bers of the Stanford varsity,
some perfect tennis will he
visible today. —L. K.. Jr.

too, and thus giving Harry Wel
ter's tribe an even break. But
this started out to be a tennis
yarn, so enough of baseball.
With Mrs. Moody will be Mrs.
L. A. Harper, herself a player
of international reputation, and
•Joe Coughlin. Aided by mem
bers of the Stanford varsity,
some perfect tennis will he
visible today. —L. K.. Jr.
Today's exhibition marks Mrs.
Helen Wills Moody's second appear
ance on the Stanford courts, and the
stands are certain to be jammed.
"Miss Poker Face" plays a fair game
of tennis, so scats will be scarce.
Just by the way, v/e warn members
of the student body to bring their
little tan cards along to prove that
they are Stanford students.
On Mrs. Moody's first appear
ance here, student body cards
were required to admit people
to the stands, much to the cha
grin ol' many. We remember that
I lie president of the Women's
Athletic Association had been
thoughtless enough to leave her
card behind that day, and after
much argument was barred from
the bleachers.
It remained for a freshman lass to
be the heroine. Coming in, she had
her card punched, circled the busy
B.A.C. copper, and dropped the card
to the unfortunate young lady. The
eyes of several score roughs fol
lowed Miss as she ascended
the stairs with the used card. But
the policeman was a gentleman, and
bravely punched another number,
amid the cheers of the multitude.
Mrs. Moody - won all of the
sets in which she took part on
that auspicious occasion, and
may do the same today. On the
whole, however, the Indians will
be able to put a far stronger
tennis team on the court this
year than was the case during
the 19,'J0 season, in spite of how
the Stanford varsity looks play
ing against the world's tennis
queen.
With Keith Glcdhill, Captain Ted
Easton, Harry Plymire, Joe Cough
lin, "Chuck" Wcesner, Phil Nieder
aur, and others displaying a win
ning species of net work, the Car
dinals should triumph over Cali
fornia's tennis team. And it would
bi j the first net victory for Stanford
since 1928.
We read in the Daily Califor
nian that some optimists are
already doping the Big Meet,
with California given a chance
to win by one point. If Stanford
does: not win that cinder combat
by at least 20 points—we were
going to say .'lO, but we'll save
that for later in the season—
Robert Lyman Templeton will
be grossly disappointed, along
with numerous other Redskins.
And so, conceding Stanford a win
in tennis and track, we come to the
third major sport of spring—base-
ball. Here the Bears can offer Little
Norman Horner, of axe and pitching
fame, for which no balm has been
found in the ranks of the Indian
nine. That chap has just been dyna
mite to the Cardinals, having won
SIX games—two series—from the
locals.
In view of his pitching, it is
too had the famous 21 did not
bring Horner back with them
too, and thus giving Harry Wel
ter's tribe an even break. But
this started out to be a tennis
yarn, so enough of baseball.
