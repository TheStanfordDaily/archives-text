# Middle West Seething With Athletic Disputes
## THREE SCHOOLS FOUND IN ROW OH ATHLETICS Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin Arguing On Salaries, Subsidization 
### 
CHICAGO. Jan. 28 (/P). —All is not
quiet along the western conference
front.
In the wake of the era of peace
and tranquility that followed lowa's
reinstatement to good standing last
spring, many internal disputes and
ruptures have broken out. The ath
letic group, composed of ten of the
leading midwest universities sizzled
with excitement today.
Down at Indiana, Coach Pat Page
was involved in a dispute with the
University Athletic Board over his
resignation and salary differences.
It may eventually affect the entire
conference.
House Investigates
A sharp reverberation of its ex
pulsion from the conference was
heard over at lowa where the edu
cational committee of the state
House of Representatives demanded
an investigation of charges that
Walter A. Jessup, President of the
University, was largely responsible
for the conference's ouster order.
At Wisconsin, the controversy over
the retention of Glen Thistlethwaite
as head football coach refused to
die. Many alumni still fought his
backers and while the Faculty Ath
letic Committee refused to dismiss
him at its meeting December 19, the
fight against him was carried on.
Eligibility Examined
Added to these cases were the
agitation here and there among
alumni to get coaches with winning
football and basketball ways and an
investigation by the conference of
the athletic eligibility of several
football players—an investigation
still marked by secrecy as far as
names were concerned.
The Page case attracted attention
of the conference leaders because
of a purported "Alumni Salary
Pool."
Alumni Pay Wage
Page contended that when he
came to Indiana in 1926, a small
group of friendly alumni volunteered
to pay half of his salary of between
$12,000 and $13,000 a year. When he
failed to place a winning team, he
said, they broke their promise, the
University absorbing the full con
tract. Subsequently, he said, the
University gave him another con
tract through the year of 1931 for
$13,000. Since he was requested to
resign, Pace contended further, the
University owed him $16,750, in
cluding his 1931 salary.
The University Board of Control,
however, is fighting his demand,
claiming it owes him salary only up
to April 1 when his resignation takes
affect.
