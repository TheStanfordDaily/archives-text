# STEEL THUNDERBOLTS
## Bluebird II, New Speed Monster, to Challenge World Racing Record al Daytona Beach, Florida 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Everybody is interested in these j
annual attempts by Englishmen to j
break the world's speed record at
Daytona Beach. Florida. There is
something horribly fascinating about
these speed-monsters which come to
our shores every year at this time,
and as we all are more or less wor- \
shippers at the shrine of the God
of Speed anyway, we, therefore, look
[ upon these British sportsmen and
! their creations with awe and envy.
That's why you can buy miniature
Sunbeam "Mystery S's," "Golden |
Arrows," and "Blue Birds" in al- '
most any toy shop. What boy would- |
n't give his right eye for a chance '
to seat himself in one of these Bui- I
lets-on-wheels, and imagine himself
a death-defying racing driver setting
a new world's speed record?
Danger Is Attraction
The unavoidable element of dan
ger too, attracts the morbidly curi- j
ous. At least two who tried to go j
faster on wheels than man has ever
gone before met a terrible dea ( th in
the sands of the Florida beach, and s
Segrave, the holder of the present
record, died in setting a new speed
mark for motor boats last year. So
here's good luck to the intrepid
Captain Campbell, more power to
you and more horse-power to your
gallant steed!
For the benefit of those who have ,
forgotten, the chronology of man's |
attempts to set new world's speed
records at Daytona Beach, Florida, j
"Mystery S" did 203.79. Campbell's ;
"Mystery S'' did 203.79. Sampbell
took the record away the following !
year with his Bluebird, doing 206.95. i

Lockhart Killed
Frank Lockhart was killed trying
to beat this mark, but J. M. White's
Triplex, driven by Ray Keech, suc
ceeded in going at a rate of 207.55,
also in 1928.
Then came 1929, with Segrave's
Golden Arrow and a new mark of
231.36, which still stands, and a new
tragedy, when Lee Bible met his
death in the smash-up of White's
Triplex. Campbell set a five-mile
record of 1:25.11 this year, averag
ing 211.91 in South Africa. Kaye
Don, with his "Silver Bullet," came
over last year but failed to reach
even 200 miles per hour.
