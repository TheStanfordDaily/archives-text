# LYONS TO MAKE CAMPUS DEBUT
## Gives Fine Characterization In Physicist's Role 
### 
Making his debut to Stanford
audiences in "Wings Over Europe"
Friday night, James Lyons, cast as
the physicist Lightfoot, gives prom
ise of doing one of the finest char
acterizations seen on the local stage.
No other campus actor could give
a more understanding performance
of the highly strung, sensitive art
ist-scientist, declared Harold Hel
venston, director of dramatics. Lyons
has the capacity for submerging his
personality into his role and making
His interpretation a vivid, realistic
whole in which there are no let
downs.
Lyons, who was engaged in dra
matic work at Reed College in 1926
and 1927, has since worked with the
Portland Civic Theatre. Algernon in
Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of
Being Earnest," and the part of Wu
Hu Git in "The Yellow Jacket" are
two parts which he has played.
While at the University of Oregon
he also received favorable comments
for his characterization of Villon in
"If I Were King."
Described as modest and nervous,
Lightfoot goes from the extreme of
confusion to the confidence of a
man who holds the destiny of the
British Cabinet and of the world
itself in his hands. Not at ease in
the world of affairs, when possessed
by an idea or principle, his awk
wardness vanishes. His voice
strengthens and his gestures and
bearing display a certain nobility as
fiery as it is un-English.
Few productions offer more op
portunity for accurate and delicate
inflections and gestures upon which
the success of the play will depend.
