## Babe Baseball Coach Has Only Seventeen From Which To Choose 
### 
Making their" debut in baseball
1 circles next Tuesday, the freshman i
baseball nine under the tutelage of
i Coach Murray Cuddebaek will meet j
one of the prep school nines of the |
bay region in the first game of the i
season.
Although the freshman baseball j
] schedule is practically complete, it j
. is yet to be approved by the Faculty j
Athletic Committee which will meet j
Friday night to put its official stamp ,
l of approval on the schedules ol both
the frosh and varsity contests. ,
Outcome Is Doubtful
• Just how the freshmen will bear ;
up under the initial encounter is a i
question. With only 17 players from j
' which to pick a smooth-running j
' nine, Coach Cuddebaek has no small j
task before him.
In the outfield Cuddebaek has only ;
, two men showing promise of doing
first-rate work. Richard Miles and |
1 Newton Goldmann are the candi- j
1 dates that will probably snag the j
! long hits.
Pitchers Compete
Stan Anderson, who appears to j
i be a cinch for the pitching position,
! is going to have some stiff compe- j
! tition from Bob Savinske, who j
{turned out for practice for the first :
| time yesterday.
Plenty of green material and less i
than two men for each position ,
make the prospects of a brilliant !
season for the nine improbable.
