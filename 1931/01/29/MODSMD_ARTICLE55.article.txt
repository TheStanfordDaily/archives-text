# FROSH QUINTET PREPARES FOR FRESNO CAGERS
## Coach Bunn Drills Babes With Workout On Fundamentals 
### Lowell Cox 
Following their close win over
j Galileo Tuesday night, the freshman
basketball quintet went to work yes-
I terday afternoon in preparation for
| their tangle Saturday night with the
! Fresno prep team.
Coach John Burin sent the year
| lings through the usual workout on
j fundamentals, and drilled them on
i the rough spols they showed in
Tuesday's game.
The frosh will probably lino up
! against Fresno much as they did
j against the San Francisco high
! school five, with Maentz and Mas
; sey, forwards; Packard, center, and
i Jenkins and Wright, guards.
Babes Play Smoothly
This combination functioned
smoothly in the first half of the
Galileo contest, but was rather
wobbly in the closing periods.
The loss of Smith at guard was
felt keenly, his sharp-shooting eye
being missed in particular. Wright
works hard but is no Smith. Jon
kins' height is a big help on de
fense, and the big fellow is show
j ing improvement.
: Packard was high-point man fyr
! the Galileo game because of his
! ability to sink foul shots. He dropped
: in no less than five of them, while
! accounting for only two field goals,
i He seems to have forgotten how to
| shoot short shots uc.der the bucket,
however.
Maentz Looks Good
Maentz had an opportunity to
show what he can cfo at forward,
' Topping being kept on the bench
' with a broken thumb. He has a
, nice shooting but is inclined to
' roughness.
Massey is aJways a dependable
i floor man, ansd if he could only
j shoot, might (J evelop into the most
valuable on the squad.
