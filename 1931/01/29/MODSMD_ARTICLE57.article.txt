# THIRTY YEARS LATER— Bawlout Reveals Change EAST AND SOUTH LOSE
## 
### 
As the twentieth century thunders |
along, Stanford is becoming a world !
cosmopolite, while the aristocracy of -
the eastern states, and the spirit of
the old South is disappearing from
the campus.
This much is apparent in a com
parison of the bawlout which began
the century in the winter of 1900,
and the present winter quarter edi
tion.
Many Californians
Then as 'pow, three-fourths of
Stanford students are native Cali
fornians. Either eastern colleges are
claiming their own, or "Go West,
young man" is discarded wisdom,
because the proportion of Easterners
in the student body, offering pleas
ant variety when they numbered
six per cent of the enrollment, has
dwindled to half that.
Soft-voiced Southerners are a
passing shadow. Less than one per
cent of Stanford students claim
plantation backgrounds.
But what Stanford has lost in
savior-faire of the East and charm .
of the South, she has gained in pic- i
turesque mixture of foreign nations. I
Foreign Students Drawn
In 1900. Stanford drew a foreign j
student element from nine countries, |
principally from Japan. Today the
proportion of foreigners in the stu
dent body has doubled, China lead
ing, and Japan pushed to fourth j
place in a list of 20 nations.
Three major island groups and all j
the continents except Antarctica are 1
represented at Stanford, in a stretch j
from Norway to southernmost Bo- I
livia. Other far-flung counries listed !
in the bawlout are Alaska, Mexico, ■
Holland, Peru, Austria, Belgium, j
Brazil, France, Italy, Porto Rico, I
Canada, Germany, England, Hawaii, j
the Philippines, and Central Amer- I
ica.
