# NATION'S CAPITAL TURNS AGAIN TO PLAN OF CITY MADE BY FRENCHMAN IN 1790
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28. (/P)—ln
the late 1790's two men stood on a
hill and scanned the ten-mile square
of wilderness beside the Potomac
river which was to be the capital
of the United States.
One was Pieire Charles I'Enfant,
French engineer. The other was his
friend, George Washington. These
two visioned on the eminence where
they were standing the capitol of
the nation vaulting its dome toward
the sky and before them a city
beautiful rising from cane brake
and forest.
Most of America's cities since 1920
have expanded with the smoke from
their industrial chimneys. Washing
ton turned back to I'Enfant for guid
ance. In the ten years it has done
more toward carrying out his dream
than in any other like period in the
country's history.
L'Enfant's Dream Realized
The Frenchman quarreled with
those who did not grasp his concep
tion and quit after laying out the
broad plan. His hope for the most
beautiful capitol in the world was
almost forgotten as time went on.
But not quite. The idea persisted
and grew into the semblance of
reality in 1926 when a $200,000,000
building program for Washington
was agreed upon.
The close of 1930 found that pro
gram which will obliterate the relics
and ruins on the south side of Penn
sylvania avenue under way. The
shabby, dreary-eyed buildings hous
ing Chinese laundries and wholesale
grocery concerns still stand, but the
wreckers' hand is upon them.
$17,500,000 Commerce Building
Some have already gone, torn
down to make way for the $17,500,-
000 commerce building near Fif
teenth street and the avenue. It is
virtually complete. The 810,000,000
bureau of internal revenue not far
away is finished.
These two are a part of the group
which will stand in "the triangle,"
the 70 acres between Pennsylvania
avenue, Band Fifteenth streets.
Back of them is "The Mall" which
I'Enfant saw as a wide strip of park
running from the capitol to the Po
tomac river on the west with the
three-crowned hills of Virginia in
the background.

! The capitol faces the east, for it
was thought the town's residential
and business growth would be large
ily in that direction. It went the
other way instead and the period
; from 1920 to 1930 saw the movement
] to the north and west increase in
| stead of diminishing.
Historic Houses Razed
Business made a sweep on Con
| necticut avenue, once the best resi
dential district, from Lafayette
Square to Dupont Circle. Alexander
Graham Bell's house just south of
the circle, was torn down and the
i old Vanderbilt mansion on K street
demolished. The mansions in which
; John Adams and John Hay once
i lived were razed.
Georgetown, where one cannot
move a brick without disturbing
history, became fashionable again.
1 Colonial mansions are being remod
eled and the wealthy and famous
have displaced negro tenants.
For all its celebrities and public
, magnificcnce, Washington has a no
i ticeable touch of country village at
mosphere. The bulk of its population
i is farm sons and daughters. Pedes
trians still stroll along the principal
streets, the pace only slightly faster
{ than that around a county scat
i courthouse.

more toward carrying out his dream
than in any other like period in the

L'Enfant's Dream Realized
The Frenchman quarreled with
those who did not grasp his concep
tion and quit after laying out the
broad plan. His hope for the most
beautiful capitol in the world was
almost forgotten as time went on.
But not quite. The idea persisted
and grew into the semblance of
reality in 1926 when a $200,000,000
building program for Washington
was agreed upon.
The close of 1930 found that pro
gram which will obliterate the relics
and ruins on the south side of Penn
sylvania avenue under way. The
shabby, dreary-eyed buildings hous
ing Chinese laundries and wholesale
grocery concerns still stand, but the
wreckers' hand is upon them.
$17,500,000 Commerce Building
Some have already gone, torn
down to make way for the $17,500,-
000 commerce building near Fif
teenth street and the avenue. It is
virtually complete. The 810,000,000
bureau of internal revenue not far
away is finished.
These two are a part of the group
which will stand in "the triangle,"
the 70 acres between Pennsylvania
avenue, Band Fifteenth streets.
Back of them is "The Mall" which
I'Enfant saw as a wide strip of park
running from the capitol to the Po
tomac river on the west with the
three-crowned hills of Virginia in
the background.

was thought the town's residential
and business growth would be large
ily in that direction. It went the
other way instead and the period
