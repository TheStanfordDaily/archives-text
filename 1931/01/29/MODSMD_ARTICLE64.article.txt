# MEENTZ ADVANCES NEW EXPLANATION OF SEA CURRENTS
## Water Sucked From Ocean To Earth's Center And Ejected At Poles

DALLAS, Tex., Jan. 28 (/Phâ€”A
i theory that sea water circulates
j through the center of the earth by
means of innumerable fissures
reaching down from the ocean floors
is advanced by Dr. Richard Ammg
Meentz of the Geology Faculty of
Southern Methodist University to
explain the 14 great ocean currents,
such as the Gulf Stream.
Dr. Meentz's revolutionary theory,
published today, is thai water is
j sucked from the bottom of the ocean
in the equatorial regions to the
earth's center and then expelled in
the vicinity of either the North or
South Poles.
He conceives the interior of the
earth to be composed of gaseous
vapors, plastic material and solids.
The fissures are located, he says,,
in ocean deeps in the equatorial re
j gions, of which oceanographcrs have
located 57 having a known depth of
I more than 18,000 feet,
j He referred to the great ocean
| currents as "reflecting eddies," pro
, pelled by the subterranean whirl
! pool-like exit of the waters from the
!center of the earth.
