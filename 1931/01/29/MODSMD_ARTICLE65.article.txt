# BUSINESS VALUE OF EDUCATION IS TOPIC OF SEARS LECTURE
## 
### 
That if education is to be worth
while it should be taken more seri
ously from a business standpoint
was the statement of Dr. J. B. Sears,
professor of education, in his talk
on the "Relation of Education to
j Business" before the Palo Alto Ex
j change Club Tuesday night.
Two points must be taken seri
j ously, according to Sears, when
| business makes a diagnosis of edu
j cation. They are these questions:
1. Is education a business of im
portance among businesses?
2. Is our investment in education
a good investment?
To show the trend of education
toward "big business" it was stated
that approximately $15,000,000 is
spent annually by California on
elementary public education.
"Every dollar invested in school
plants throughout the country car- :
ries a debt of 50 cents. The long
time bond plan of financing school
buildings is one that is working a I
heavy burden on this country at the \
present time, but this is just one
item of inefficiency in the present
system of school management."
In conclusion the speaker said i
: Ihat the schools in this country had j
j done more than any other agent in ;
; banishing fear, superstition, â€¢ and '
l hatred from the minds of people, J
j and that through the schools the
j correct conception of government is '
j carried to the populace. 1
