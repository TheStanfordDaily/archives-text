# EASTON HOLDS POST ON TENNIS TEAM BY DEFEATING PLYMIRE
## 
### 
Ted Easton decisively held his po
sition as second man on the varsity
team against the onslaught of Harry
Plymire by a score of 6-1, 6-3.-This
definitely fixes the first three rank
ing players unless an upset occurs
later in the season.
Results of other ladder matches
show a few steady "climbers." Kel
sey Petterson emerged victorious
from a three-set struggle with Hu
bert Butler, 8-6, 3-6, 6-4, to pull
into tenth place; Blethen won from
Johnston by default, and Bergstrom
defeated Johnston 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Freshman results follow: Torrence
defeated Barnes 6-1, 6-1, and John
son won over Hodge 6-8, 7-5, 7-5,
then downed Fries by a 4-6, 6-4,
6-4 score.
