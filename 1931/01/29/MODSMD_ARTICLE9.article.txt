: counted for 7 points, most of them
scored under difficult circumstances.
Breakers and the Business School
I were the other victors of the eve
ning. The former quintet won from
Phi Sigma Kappa 32-6 after a sloV
start. Despite the top-heavy score
the Phi Sigs put up a courageous
fight. Their aggressiveness broke up
J whatever teamwork Breakers had
during the entire first half, and it
was not until Goldsmith and Philippi
started dropping in shots from alt
i angles in the second half that they
were swamped. This is the second
! straight victory for Breakers; they
1 downed the Southerners, 25-7, in
! their first start.
Theta Xi Downed
Showing occasional streaks of bas
ketball, the Business School downed
Theta Xi, 18-9, in the third game
of the evening. Delta Tau Delta,
which was to have played the Law
! School, won by default.
Games tonight are:
i Southerners vs. El Capitan in the
| gym at 8 o'clock and Chi Psi vs.
! El Tigre in the gym at 7.
