# HOOPSTERS SET TO TURN BACK BRUIN INVASION
## Improved Indian Five Given Chance To Atone For U.C.L.A. Defeats LINTHICUM IS THREAT 
### Jack Jernegan 
Despite the fact that U.C.L.A. is
at present first in the Pacific Coast
Conference southern division stand
ings with a record of three wins
and only one loss, the Stanford In
dians have a very good chance to
defeat the Bruin basketball players
tomorrow evening when the two
teams met in the Pavilion.
Since the Cardinal quintet lost
the first two games in its series with
the Bruins much has transpired in
basketball circles. Coach John Bunn
has brought the Redshirts along
slowly but steadily, with the result
ihat, they have won their last two
conference games and have looked
better on each appearance.
Improvement (iocs On
That this improvement is still
continuing is evidenced by the snap
and dash that the cagers have dis
played in scrimmages this week. The
practice Wednesday afternoon was
characterized by Coach Bunn as the
best he has seen this year, while
yesterday's workout was by no
means discouraging the Stanford
followers.
Varsity Meets Grays
The first team was engaged by a
Gray quintet made'up of Meade and
Tyler, forwards; Doub, center; Han
cock and Baker, guards. This com
bination gave the regulars an even
battle, and both teams played fast,
hard basketball for the half-hour
that the scrimmage lasted. A very
fast break was much in evidence as
was a rapid-fire passing attack.
In consequence of these encour
aging exhibitions Stanford fans can
feci that the Cardinal aggregation
is in no way inferior to the U.C.L.A.
men.
Linthicum a Threat
The chief problem that Coach
Bunn and his men have facing them
is to stop the blond-headed Bruin
center, Dick Linthicum. Linthicum
is the shining star of Coach Caddy
Works' team, accounting for a large
portion of the Bruin points. He was
the biggest cause of the Indians' de
feat in the first tilts with the South
erners, piling up big totals in each
contest.
Lubin, veteran guard, is another
obstacle which Stanford must sur
mount. He stands six feet four
inches in height and has the ex
perience to match the Redshirt de
fensive star, Vance Fawcett.
If Captain Mike Reynolds and his
cohorts can win a victory over
U.C.LA. they will be on the high
road to a clean slate for the rest of
their conference season. Having de
feated both U.S.C. and California
they feel that they can do it again,
and there is no real reason why
they should not. The Bruins are the
doubtful hurdle; if they get over it,
all will be well.
Starting lineups as announced yes
terday are:
Stanford— U.C.L.A.—
Moffatt F Von Hagen
Cordry F Knowles
Reynolds C Linthicum
Fawcett C Brotmarkel
Rintala G Lubin
