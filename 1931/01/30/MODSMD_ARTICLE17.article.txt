# OFFICIAL DECLARES RETAIL MERCHANTS ARE HOLDING OWN
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 211 <7Pi._Dr.
Julius Klein, assistant secretary of
commerce, believes the independent
retail merchant is holding his own
in competition with the chain store.
Basing his conclusions on data col
lected on a tour of the mid-west, he
is outspoken in his opinion that the
local independent, engaged in the
stillest commercial contest in modern
times, is achieving a considerable
measure of victory.
"The new chain store extensions
are taking their first experience with
seriously slackened business," Dr.
Klein observed, "and my idea is that
the impact of adversity hasn't been
any lighter upon this relatively new
form of retail organization than upon
the traditional independents.
