## 
### BY COLLIER CONNELL 
Future tennis rivalry between
California-Stanford women is the
hope expressed by Helen Wills
Moody, former student at the Uni
versity of California, now world
famous sportswoman.
"Little Poker-Face" was anything i
but that, as she discussed women's I
tennis, after finishing a brilliant ex- j
hibition match on the Stanford 1
courts yesterday afternoon.
Women's intercollegiate matches I
would put new vigor into Coast ten
nis circles, raise the level of the
undergraduate game, and be an
other picturesque contact between
the two universities, she suggests.

Lag in women's athletics she at
tributes to the restricting influence
of physical education departments,
which frown upon any form of wo
men's intercollegiate competition, on
the grounds that it forces the college
girl too strenuously into the game.
The grace and poise of Mrs. :

Moody, her lithe body, controlled
strength of muscle, and her perfect
health arc significant denial of this
argument.
"Tennis four or five times a
week " is her formula for keep
ing fit, and exquisitely fit she is,
despite the so-called ruinous effects
of hard-played tennis.
Beauty Not Blemished
Her charming femininity, in no
way blemished by the rifle-shot of
her racquet, discredits the belief
that woman's place is on the bleach
ers.
The college years are important
training years, Mrs. Moody declared.
Her tennis experience at Berkeley
was confined to a private club. She
did not play on university teams,
she said.
"Stanford shows a gratifying in
terest in tennis," said the veteran
of Wimbledon courts. "I've enjoyed
the informality and enthusiasm to
ward the match this afternoon."
