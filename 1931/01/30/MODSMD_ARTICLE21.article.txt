# CAPITAN, TIGRE IN INTRAMURAL HOOP VICTORIES
## Hall Teams Down Chi Psi, Southerners After Close Tilts 
### 
Launching a second period rally
after trailing El Tigre 6-11, at half
time, the Chi Psi basketball team
came within one bucket of tying the
game, which ended 15-13.
Highlights in this Chi Psi rally
were Russ and Winger, each of whom
shot two buckets from far out. These
circus shots typified the Chi Psi scor
ing, their teamwork being inadequate
to working the ball in for setups. El
Tigre, on the other hand, counted
most of their points on short shots.
Garibotti led their assault with seven
points; Petit and Bernstrom led the
battery, besides getting four points
apiece.
After matching El Capitan's bucket
barrage during the early part of the
game, the Southerners wilted enough
to drop a 22-13 decision. Their drib
bling was the factor which enabled
them to make a showing in the first
half. Not only did it upset the Capi
tan defense, but also gave the South
erners numerous free throws, half of
which they made good.
El Capitan had a passing attack
good enough to give them a lot of
easy tries and in Stump, their for
ward*, a man who could take ad
vantage of opportunities. He got five
baskets and one free throw to take
high point honors of the evening.
Fair, Capitan guard, garnered eight
markers.
Intramural games which have been
postponed may be played off any

Parker Reed, director of intramural
athletics. By notifying him ahead of
time, a referee can be obtained.
