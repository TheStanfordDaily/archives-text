body, Ben Palamountain, freshman,
thumped his way to the University
heavyweight championship in the
concluding battle of last night's
tournament in the Pavilion.

in weight, reach, and boxing ex

and clever boxer. After being drop
ped to the canvas in the first round,
he came back strong in the second
and, in spite of the punishment he
was taking, succeeded in opening a
cut over Palamountain's eye in the
third frame. The fight was mostly

landing everything in his repertoire,
when Referee Flannigan jumped in.

outpointed by his veteran antagon
ist.
In a dazzling exhibition of speed,
punch, and ring tactics, Miller got
i a technical K.O. in his welterweight
clash with Tommy Glover. At the

around with lightning fast rights and
; lefts that usually found their mark.
Rogers Victor

! knockout in the second frame of his
fight with Fred Gist. Gist forced the

I Gist over the K.O. route.
Freddie Glover greatly outclassed
1 his game but bewildered feather
rival. Griffith Page, throughout the
. match. Page didn't get a chance to
| land on Glover's bobbing, aggressive
head, and was on the floor shortly

Imai put on a fast and clever box

were Gordon Gilbert, light-heavy;
Fred Johnson, middleweight; Dick
Miller, welter; Vance Rogers, light
weight; Fred Glover, feather; and
Yuji Imai, bantam.
After getting off to a slow start in
the first round, Gilbert improved
steadily in his bout with Hugh
Keenan, and was outpunching and
outboxing his rival at the bell in
the third. After getting inside
Keenan's guard in the second, Gil
bert rocked him time and again with
right hooks to the button.
Johnson vs. Johnson
Fred Johnson, captain of the In
dian varsity leather-pushers, un
leashed all the dynamite he packs
in either hand when he climbed into
the ring with M. C. Johnson, and
was awarded a technical knockout
near the end of the first round. Fred
had his man on the ropes and was
landing everything in his repertoire,
when Referee Flannigan jumped in.
M. C. was a long ways from out, but
he had been sadly outclassed and
outpointed by his veteran antagon
ist.
In a dazzling exhibition of speed,
punch, and ring tactics, Miller got
i a technical K.O. in his welterweight
clash with Tommy Glover. At the
! first of the one and only round,*
Miller proved that he is anything
but an easy target, but after the
I first few seconds he followed Glover
around with lightning fast rights and
; lefts that usually found their mark.
Rogers Victor
Rogers had his mitt hoisted for a
! knockout in the second frame of his
fight with Fred Gist. Gist forced the
fight in the first, and showed uo
fairly well until Roger's superior
I pugilistic skill got him inside Gist's
i longer reach. A left jab to the face
j and a hard right to the body sent
I Gist over the K.O. route.
Freddie Glover greatly outclassed
1 his game but bewildered feather
rival. Griffith Page, throughout the
. match. Page didn't get a chance to
| land on Glover's bobbing, aggressive
head, and was on the floor shortly
! before the bout ended.
Imai put on a fast and clever box
ing show for three rounds with the
asistance of Mark Kai-Kee. Both
boys sparred and slugged nicely, but
Imai's leads found their marks of
| tener, and Ksfi-Kee was weakening
I rapidly when the third bell rang.
At the conclusion of the card,
Hary B. Smith, San Francisco sport
! ing editor, awarded the University
medals and the Gene Tunney minia
ture gold gloves to the winners.
Staving off all attacks with a stiff,
jarring left and landing vicious
hooks to Bill Harding's face and
body, Ben Palamountain, freshman,
thumped his way to the University
heavyweight championship in the
concluding battle of last night's
tournament in the Pavilion.
Palamountain shaded his opponent
in weight, reach, and boxing ex
perience, but the bout was no walk
away. Harding proved to be a game
and clever boxer. After being drop
ped to the canvas in the first round,
he came back strong in the second
and, in spite of the punishment he
was taking, succeeded in opening a
cut over Palamountain's eye in the
third frame. The fight was mostly
Palamountain all the way, however,
the big freshman showing plenty of
punch and ring form throughout.
