ITom the throes of discussion over the recent award of $100,000
1o the I Diversity for a five-year investigation of the advantages of
lhe independent study plan, there have risen two questions:
1. Does the grant mean that the existence of the Lower Division
is guaranteed for another five years?
2. Is the grant an indication the once-strong desire of the \\ ilbur
administration to eliminate the Lower Division, is still being con
sidered ?
To prove the affirmative of tbeX"'st question, there are those who
quote the following from Acting-President Robert I\. Swain's an
nouncemeiit of the gi ft :
"The grant of the (ieneral Education Hoard will make possible
(luring ibis fivc-vear period a marked development in the preparation
of individual students, particularly in the first two years of their
college work. I Mans for the new work now under consideration will
go into effect during the current academic year."
Then there are those who say the second query is more apt and
quote Dr. Swain's announcement as follows:
"In the state of California and particularly at Stanford, there is
interest in the development of new methods for handling instruc
tion in junior colleges and in setting standards for the admission of
junior college students into the upper division."
This last quotation was the third and final reason for which
Stanford was given the $100,000 grant, Dr. Swain announced. The
other reasons were because Stanford has "a highly selective student
body" and because it "has developed, in the freshman year and in
the independent study plan for the upper division, a means by which
:i beginning has been made in education for the individual student."
