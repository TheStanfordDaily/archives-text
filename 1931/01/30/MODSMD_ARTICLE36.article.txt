# DOLLARS FOR DUMBBELLS
## 
### 
I nrlivirlual donations to the Women's' (iyin Fund have readied a
total of more than four hundred dollars in the past few days as re
sponses come in from the parents of the freshman women. In fact
the grand total of the furnishing fund is within one hundred and
fifty dollars of three thousand. Which leaves only seventeen thou
sand to go ! And two months to do it.
While the bulk of the remainder will probably come from out
side donations eventually, the members of the Five Hundred will
have an opportunity next week to make their contribution as a body.
Jll an economically bad year, literally crowded with appeals of all
sorts the already drained pocketbooks of the women will probably
be approached with difficulty. But the new gym does not come under
ihe same head as the yearly charity drives held in such dread.
The furnishing of this magnificent new building is a constructive
and lasting projectâ€”one which will be a permanent monument to
the endeavor and accomplishment of the Five Hundred. As such it
is fitting that the present women students dig down deep and make
it a thing of beauty which they can rightly call their own.
The deeper you dig next week, girls, the more dumbbells and
trapezes for you and the future athletic "squaws" of the harm. Ihe
more moiiev the more muscle; and the more muscle the more money.
