CERTAIN PEOPLE. By Edith
Wharton. Appleton, N.Y. 19110. (Al
the Palo Alto Hook Shop.)
Six entirely different stories, writ
ten with the consistent and unusual
artistry that make Edith Wharton
one of the foremost American writ
ers, comprise a cosmopolitan whole
that ranges from everyday people to
the realms of fantasy.
Perhaps the best is "After Hol
bein," which delves into the old age
of two society members clinging to
the grandeur of their youth with
pathetic and almost splendid
staunchness. Another is the story of
Professor L) una id, mistaken for a
refugee during the war.
The most mysterious is "Mr.
Jones," which < ffers possibilities of
various interpretations. The most
horrible is "A Bottle of Ptrrier." Its
ending creeps on the reader with its
gripping significance — fascinating,
peculiar, penetrating the.depths of
human moods. —J. N.
THE DICKENS ADVERTISER.
Edited by Bernard Darwin. New
York. 'I'iie Macmillan Co.
(At Stanford Bookstore.)
This hook is a record of the ad
vertisements that appeared in the
original parts of novels used by
these Victorian advertisers, as well
as the texts of their manifestos to
the public.
The reproductions and the com
ments of the editor are very inter
esting, whatever may be their value

| as contributions to the social history
|of the period during which they
j were published. The testimonials, in
j particular, are charming reflections
j of the age, and there are many of
1 them, though none purport to come
j from the pens of contemporary eele-
I brities.
It may be noted that no signs of
great intelligence in the reading
public is to be found, since there are
more advertisements of cure-all pills
, than of any other commodity.

| BERKFLEY SQUARE. By John L.
Baldcrston; Macmillian. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Peter Standish was one of those
i fellows with acute imagination. His
| ideas that past, present, and future
! were one, that he could transport
! himself from time to time were only
' a figment of this overwrought ima
i gination; but when lie did do 1 his,
| when ho arrived in eighteenth cen
i tury Berkeley Square in place of
I one of his ancestors, the people
[ about him thought that the devil
incarnate was among them.
Crudely as we have suggested the
j content of this unsual tale—an im
j possible one to relate with any de
j gree of success —we can only remark
i upon its charm, state that is not the
I play for the cyinical undergraduate.
| Rather is it a piay for one who can
' submerge himself into the person
l ality of Peter, who can live the play
jas he reads it. —J. S. S.
