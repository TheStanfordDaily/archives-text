AGED HENRIETTA SIGHS
FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS
The Editor, Sir:
"The only trouble with Misters
Pence, Jameson, and Fox," remarked
Henrietta, "is that Ihey are crying
i for something out of reach. The abo
lition of the grading system would
strike at the root of our present evil
and a good many others besides—
but it is a change that hardly comes
within the province of student gov
ernment..
{ "On the other hand, we students
I do have (we assume) a degree of
I control over the Honor Code. We
can smile sweetly at the
j of the Executive Committee —or we
| can tell them to go to hell."
{ Henrietta blushed at her own
j brazenness.
"Maybe sometime the Academic
S Council or the Board of Trustees, or
whoever decides such matters, will

I see their way clear to eliminate giv
i ing grades in courses—and here's to
j the day.
i "But what worries me is that if
j we all keep our eyes on that distant
j day, we may forget that it isn't
really necessary for us to handle the
j grading system in as childish a man
j ner as we have been. We don't
' really have to destroy the Honor
! Code by officialism.
"As n matter of fact, there are
: several arguments for giving grades
j —but none at all for encouraging
I dishonesty by making a game of it,
: which seems to be the only result
iof multiplying the penalties and
formalities conected with the pres
' ent 'Honor' Code.
"Yes," sighed Henrietta, "I get
' myself all worked up over it. Maybe
; it is just because I remember when
;we really had an honor system
j here." —Jim Tucker.
