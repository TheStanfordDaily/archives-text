an awfully clean game. Have never

Tonight some of us who couldn't
think of a good excuse for not going,
and some others who really wonder
about it, will get our feet pinched

pre-writes have been so enthusias
tic, we wonder if there's a possi
bility of disappointment?
Being a war picture, or at least
sounding that, way beforehand, it

the Stanford Symphony Orchestra
playing "Over There," and other
real favorites (?).
Which reminds us of that
lovely poem, "In Philanderers'
Fields the Poppies Grow." (Oh,
Popper!)
