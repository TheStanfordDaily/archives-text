BRUIN BAITING
With a varsity fairly self-satisfied
after their win over California last
week, the Indians meet the U.C.L.A.
Bruins tomorrow night in the Pavil
ion. And unless the local cagers can
J'eel that it will be a tough game,
Stanford stands an excellent chance
to lose.
The Bruins already have two
Cardinal scalps dangling from
their licit, and are leading the
way in the Coast Conference.
They have every incentive to
win from Stanford, for such a
victory would set them up for
the championship of the loop,
and the Uclans have a team to
lie feared.
<» <i.i <s>
Tn Linthicum, the Bruins have
what appears to be the all-Confer
ence cage center. In Lubin, they
have one of the best guards in the
league, while their forwards will
stack up with the best on the Coast.
All told, it is a dangerous team
which faces the Indians in the
Pavilion.
Stanford is in an inevitable
mental slump after winning the
first game from the California
Bears. Whether the Itedshirts
are in a lighting mood when
game time rolls around remains
to he seen, hut certain it is that
a lethargic team cannot and will
not win from Hie southern outfit.
Most encouraging is the lioop out
look for next season, however. In
spite of the weird collection of bas
ketball assembled during the Olym
pic Club outrage, some fair ball
players cavorted for the Cardinal.
We like the playing of Baker, of
Hancock, of Meade, and of Doub—<
all of whom v/i 11 be in the fold next
year.
That Olympic Club game, by
the way, was the most amusing
spectacle to be dished up in a
long time. Hawkins' pass to Ma
loney under the local bucket;
Baker's beautiful clip of Ford;
Ford's presence on the floor in
the midst of a play; and the
irony of losing with the first
team in at the finish combined
to make it an insane evening.
Following the U.C.LA. game, the
Cardinals play the College of Pacific
five in what should be a terrific
struggle. That death battle will oc
cur on Tuesday, while a week from
today the Indians will leave for Los
Angeles, where they will conclude
hoop relations with the Trojans.
After that, the snarling Gold
cii Bear will remain to he dealt
with. A game here on the 14th
of February will be followed by
a third clash, this time in the
Oakland Auditorium, 011 Febru
ary 21. And that California
series is far from won yet. A
great many things may happen
before February 21. and a ball
game is never won until—el

ence cage center. In Lubin, they
have one of the best guards in the
league, while their forwards will
stack up with the best on the Coast.
All told, it is a dangerous team
which faces the Indians in the
Pavilion.
Stanford is in an inevitable
mental slump after winning the
first game from the California
Bears. Whether the Itedshirts
are in a lighting mood when
game time rolls around remains
to he seen, hut certain it is that
a lethargic team cannot and will
not win from Hie southern outfit.
Most encouraging is the lioop out
look for next season, however. In
spite of the weird collection of bas
ketball assembled during the Olym
pic Club outrage, some fair ball
players cavorted for the Cardinal.
We like the playing of Baker, of
Hancock, of Meade, and of Doub—<
all of whom v/i 11 be in the fold next
year.
That Olympic Club game, by
the way, was the most amusing
spectacle to be dished up in a
long time. Hawkins' pass to Ma
loney under the local bucket;
Baker's beautiful clip of Ford;
Ford's presence on the floor in
the midst of a play; and the
irony of losing with the first
team in at the finish combined
to make it an insane evening.
Following the U.C.LA. game, the
Cardinals play the College of Pacific
five in what should be a terrific
struggle. That death battle will oc
cur on Tuesday, while a week from
today the Indians will leave for Los
Angeles, where they will conclude
hoop relations with the Trojans.
After that, the snarling Gold
cii Bear will remain to he dealt
with. A game here on the 14th
of February will be followed by
a third clash, this time in the
Oakland Auditorium, 011 Febru
ary 21. And that California
series is far from won yet. A
great many things may happen
before February 21. and a ball
game is never won until—el

BRUIN BAITING
With a varsity fairly self-satisfied
after their win over California last
week, the Indians meet the U.C.L.A.
Bruins tomorrow night in the Pavil
ion. And unless the local cagers can
J'eel that it will be a tough game,
Stanford stands an excellent chance
to lose.
The Bruins already have two
Cardinal scalps dangling from
their licit, and are leading the
way in the Coast Conference.
They have every incentive to
win from Stanford, for such a
victory would set them up for
the championship of the loop,
and the Uclans have a team to
lie feared.
