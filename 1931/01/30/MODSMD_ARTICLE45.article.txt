# LES HABLES BREAKS MARK FOR 352-YARD SPRINT IN PRACTICE
## 
### 
Flying around a cinder track
which is still a little soft and loose,
Les Hables, Indian sprinter, broke
the campus record for the 352-yard
practice run Wednesday afternoon.
llis time was 3G.5 seconds, clipping
alimost a second from the former
record of 37.2 set by Bud Spenccr,
which Hables has himself equalled.
Willson, freshman runner, given
n 15-yard start, furnished competi
tion for Hables over the distance,
one which "Dink" Templcton finds
is ideal for training quarter-milers
in speed and sprinters in stamina.
This afternoon Templeton's pro
teges will compete in the weekly
squad meet. With a faster track than
Ihey have run on yet this quarter,
the varsity trackmen should give
good indications of the performances
which may be cxpected of them in
competition this season.
