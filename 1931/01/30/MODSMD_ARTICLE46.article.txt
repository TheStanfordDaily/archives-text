When the veteran battery of
Loomis and Hardy begin to open
fire across the plate at the Olympic
Club ball sluggers on the new local
diamond at 2:30 o'clock Saturday
afternoon, Stanford's 1931 baseball
season will be officially under way.
In the two encounters with the
Winged "O" outfit last season, the
Indian nine came out second best to
the tune of 13-7 and 5-3. Although
the team which will go on the field
for Stanford tomorrow is undoubt
edly a better balanced aggregation
than last year's nine, the Olympic
Club is also reputed to have a
stronger outfit.
Ex-College Stars
Among the stars on the Olympic
Club team, who are known to fans
of Bay district collegiate baseball,
are John Valianos, captain of the
1930 Golden Bear nine, Frank Wil
ton, captain of the 1929 Indian per
formers, and Garibaldi, one of Stan
ford's best-known shortstops of a
few years ago.
i There will be three positions on
the Stanford nine filled by new
comers when the umpire dons his
mask and calls ' Play ball!" tomor
row afternoon. Vince Philippi will
be holding down the hot corner,
Bert Delmas of last year's yearlings
will be in short field, and Vern
Bowles will be located in center
field.
Fast Infield Four
Judging from practice sessions
which have been held up to date,
I this year's infield appears to be one
| of the fastest and smoothest work
i ing combinations seen on the Farm
for quite some time. The ease with
: which they have been knocking off
' imaginary double plays would en
thuse even the most optimistic fan.
Harry Wolter, coach of the Indian
nine, has selected three chuckers
who will alternate on the mound,
; each taking about a three-inning
workout. They will perform in the
following order: Loomis, Johnson,
and Eadie.
The complete lineup which will
I start the game is as follows: Hardy
! catcher; Loomis, pitcher; Cook, first
| base; Philippi, second base; Delmas,
i shortstop; Johnson, third base;
Campbell, right field; Bowles, center
