i nine and 10 goal polo, and are ex

The Cardinals have played but
one game this year, with Oak Knoll,
whom they swamped easily last
quarter. Scrimmages have shown
j that Coach Govdan has developed a
j quartet of riders who work.smoothly
J together, more smoothly than any
i Stanford polo team has ever worked
j before. This afternoon's encounter
is expected to demonstrate just how
brilliant the team is.
Spalding will be at No. 1, with
Gorham No. 2, Captain McDougall
No. 3, and Fleming No. 4.
The Presidio four will line up
with Captain Robinett, No. 1; Cap

j Mathews, No. 3; Captain McChrys
,tal, No. 4.
Several new plays Captain Gordan .

Fleming, who hits the longest ball j
on the squad, doing the knocking.
To Face Arizona
Definite dates for the twolgame |
series to be played with the Uni
| versity of Arizona four here this J
quarter have not been set, but are
expected to be announced shortly,
i The University of Utah is also
; seeking games with the Cardinals to j
! be played during the spring quarter, j
They desire a home-and-home
; series, which if arranged, would be
a great stimulus for polo on the
1 Farm.

Stanford's hard-riding poloists will ;
be seen in their first game of the :
season against major competition to- i
day, when they will meet the Pre
sidio of San Francisco four. The
