CHICAGO, Jan. 29. (/P)—Science,
with the aid of the "lie detector," is
on the trail of a lot of things besides
fibs.
By employment of the machine,
which measures emotional changes
when applied to a person under
questioning, scientists hope to learn
the secrets of the influence of the
ductless glands on human conduct,
as well as determine the causes for
certain nervous disorders.
It is even possible, the speaker
said, that the "lie-detector" will be
vised in personnel work, such as
testing for character in those about
to be engaged in positions of trust.
Hence it may be important to know
the name of the apparatus in case
a prospective new employer asks
you to sit for a session with the

"pneumo-cardio-sphygmograph."
