ble fault, put Coughlin in the lead. !

failed to clear the net, and Mrs. 1
Moody took the game and set with
the next point after a good rally.
Paired with Ted Easton opposite I
Mrs. Harper and Keith Gledhill, she '
lost this encounter after three sets, j
which went 3-G, 7-5, G-4. Mrs. j

Dcuce Games
Several games were carried to ,
deuce, but the last was especially j
drawn-out. Mrs. Moody ran the
score up to point-set at 40-15, but j
lost her lea'' on two outside shots !
and a net. Now Coughlin's advan- >
tage, she pulled out in two serves j
to turn the advantage her way, but j
the next shot went astray t>f the j
court, which, combined with a dou
ble fault, put Coughlin in the lead. !
On the next play, however, his shot J
failed to clear the net, and Mrs. 1
Moody took the game and set with
the next point after a good rally.
Paired with Ted Easton opposite I
Mrs. Harper and Keith Gledhill, she '
lost this encounter after three sets, j
which went 3-G, 7-5, G-4. Mrs. j
Moody served a love game to take j
the set.
Teamwork Wins
By virtue of superior teamwork, :
largely, Mrs. Harper and Gledhill
took the second set at 7-5.
During the third set Gledhill
tried three or four times to catch
Mrs. Moody off her guard by serv
ing short to her, but in spite of her !
[stance at an unusual distance from
; the net, he never succeeded in gain
ing a point from her by this strategy,
although he did ace her once with
i his powerful service. With the score
. at 4-4, Mrs. Harper won her service
with the aid of Gledhill's - accurate
j smashes, and Mrs. Moody dropped
the next game on her serve to close
the match.
Before a crowd estimated at be
tween 3500 and 4000 persons, Mrs. >
Helen Wills Moody and Mrs. L. A. ;
Harper yesterday presented an ex
hibition of women's tennis such as j
has seldom been witnessed on the ;
local courts.
Mrs. Moody won her set with Joe |
Coughlin by the score of G-2, strok
ing easily most of the time, but tak
ing the aggressive even on Cough
lin's serve when necessary.. Her
long back-court drives, struck with ;
remarkable force, sizzled close over |
the net, oftentimes proving too much ;
for Coughlin, who played a del ens- j
ive game a good part of the time.
