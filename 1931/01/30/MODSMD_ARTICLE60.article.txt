## Eleven Colleges Drop It, Thirteen To Continue, Nine Undecided 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 29. (/P)—The
seed of moderation, sown in football I
lields by coaches and graduate man
agers at their annual pow-wow in j
New York City during the Christ- j
mas holidays, is already bearing j
fruit in elimination or reduction of
spring practice at many of the lead
ing Eastern colleges and universi- |
ties.
Thirty-three colleges today were !
asked by the Associated Press as to '
their plans for spring practice. Thir- j
teen are to continue the practice, al- j
though on a curtailed scale at some j
places. Eleven plan no spring prac- j
ticc. Nine, including the big three— i
Harvard, Yale, and Princeton —have ,
come to no definite decision. Indi- j
cations are, however, that the Big i
Three and probably several others j
on the "undecided" list will not call i
out a football squad this spring.
The list of those that will continue j
spring practice includes the Naval j
Academy, Rutgers, Dartmouth, Cor- ;
nell, Syracuse, Colgate, Pittsburgh, j
Washington & Jefferson, Duquesne, i
Penn State, Bucknell, and Temple.
Temple, however, will have only |
one week of drill and the program i
will be short at several other places, j
