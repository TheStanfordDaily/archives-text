CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 29. </P)
—A stroboscope so powerful that
still and motion pictures of a 160-
horscpower motor can be made
while the machine is running at full
speed, has been developed at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology.
The stroboscope is a scientific de
vice for "stopping" motion to study
parts of machines operating at high
speed.
The new device is used chiefly in
the study of rotating electrical ma
chinery, but it can be employed to
"stop motion" in almost any type
of machinery. It is especially useful
in determining the behavior of
cams, springs, valves, and other
moving parts.
