BERKELEY, Jan. 29. (/Piâ€” Danger
in Africa? There isn't any, says
Captain Carl von Hoffman, explorer
and ethnologist, who lectured at the
University of California last night
on "Zulu rites."
Von Hoffman, who has spent 15
years in the "Dark Continent," said
despite the legends to the contrary
the wild beasts of Africa did not
care for white meat and that the
savage tribes let white men alone
as much as possible.
"After hunting wild beasts for
days you have to stalk them to pre
vent them from running away be
fore you are near," the lecturer said.
