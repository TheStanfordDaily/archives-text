# GUARD SHIP RACES JOSEPHINE K FOR BOARD OF INQUIRY
## Gunplay Is Questioned In Probe Over Shelling Of Rum Runner 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 29. </F) — The
Josephine K, Canadian rum runner,
and the Coast Guard cutter 145 this
afternoon peacefully repeated the
race they had Saturday night off
Ambrose Light and again the Guard
ship won.
The race was held to determine
whether the cutter might have cap
tured the liquor ship in Saturday's
encounter without resorting to
shelling. That speed contest ended
with two direct hits on the Joseph
ine K by shells from the 145 and
the killing of her commander, Cap
tain William P. Cluett.
Gerald Campbell, British Consul
General in New York who has been
attending the investigation at the
request of the Canadian government
of the incident by a Coast Guard
board of inquiry, raised the ques
tion whether the gunplay was ne
cessary.
Boatswain Karl Schmidt, who fired
the shells that ripped into the rum
runner, was in command of the 145
at today's test. The Josephine K
was handled by her own men with
one exception—Boatswain W. T.
Murphy took the place of Captain
Cluett.
The cutter walked away with the
race, making a speed of 11.15 knots.
The Josephine K did only 9.55.
