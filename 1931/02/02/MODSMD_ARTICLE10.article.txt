# GRIPPING PLAY GIVEN NOTABLE DRAMATIZATION
## James Lyons, As Physicist, Wins Honors; Gantner Splendid In Role 
### Stall Reviewer 
Last Friday night was a milestone
in Stanford dramatics.
"Wings Over Europe," directed by
Harold Helvenston, by far the most
powerful, the most staggering play
attempted on this campus for years,
sent home an audience pondering
and shuddering over the fate of
mankind.
Breath-taking in its forceful de
piction of the struggle between hope
and despair — between universal
love and brute hatred—this play of
tomorrow pounded out its message
with relentless energy through three
acts of conflict.
Helvenston's Art
Builded on the scientific prophecy
that man will someday utterly and
completely control matter, "Wings
Over Europe," by Robert Nichols
and Maurice Browne, is a drama
dangerously stupendous to be put
in the hands of a college cast. But
the maturity and assurance which
characterized both the acting and
the directing of Friday night's per
formance entirely justify the exist
ence of the university theater.
With few exceptions the play
moved with a rhythm and power
belonging to the better professionals.
Helvenston's art in the building up
of cumulative emotion and in the
handling of large groups in climactic
situations is unmatched.
Lyons Has Honors
Almost, but not quite, walking
away with the laurels of the pro
duction, James Lyons in the part of
Francis Lightfoot, the young genius
physicist, put genuine fire into the
difficult role of a scientific idealist.
The play reached what was perhaps
its highest peak during Lyons' scene
at the close of the second act; and
throughout the performance it was
his understanding and almost in
spired portrayal of the controller-of
atoms and liberator -of - humanity
that held the play together.
As the inscrutable "inhuman"
Evelyn Arthur, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, Vallejo Gantner
took second honors. Far superior to
any of his previous work on the
Stanford stage, his acting in "Wings
