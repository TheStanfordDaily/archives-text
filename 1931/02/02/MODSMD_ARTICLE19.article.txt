# FINAL APPEALS FOR GYM FUND BEGIN AT ONCE
## Main Campaign Scheduled To Last Till Thursday Says Chairman. 
### 
In order to raise money to equip
the new gymnasium, Stanford wo
men will begin an intensive cam
paign for funds in the women's liv
ing groups today. The drive, which
is headed by Elisabeth Larsh, will
continue through Thursday.
This activity will comprise the
main appeal on the campus for the
$17,154.59 which has yet to be ob
tained before the building can be
sufficiently equipped and furnished
for use.
The appeal for funds has also been
taken up by various alumnae groups
and friends. Among the most re
cent of the contributions are those
from the parents of freshman wo
men.
Benefit Shows
Other campus plans include the
possibility of giving the annual
dance drama at the opening of the
gymnasium which will be about the
first of March. Arrangements are
also being made for a benefit per
formance of the puppet show "Em
peror Jones" by Eugene O'Neill.
Work on the gymnasium is nearly
completed and practically all that
remains to be done is finishing the
painting and plastering inside, and
completing the cementing of the
swimming pool and surrounding
walks.
Furnishings new in use in the old
building will be used until money
can be secured to obtain new equip
ment, although there is very little
being used which is worth moving.
Among the first things scheduled to
be bought are up-to-date medical
equipment and office furniture.

The drive in Roble, Madrono
Hall, and among the commuters will
be headed by Jane Snyder, and Lucy
Bancroft will have charge of the
