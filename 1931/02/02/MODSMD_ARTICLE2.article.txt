(/P)_All Sweden is thrilled today
at the royal romance of a 21-year
old prince and a 20-year-old daugh
ter of a commoner which has drawn
the frown of the youth's grand
father, King Gustave.
A family council was held at ihe
palace today to consider the engage
ment just announced of young
Prince Lennart and Miss Karin
Nissvandt, the daughter of a wealthy
Stockholm industrialist who is not
of royal blood or even noble blood.
No Swedish prince has married a
commoner in almost 400 years.
Should the marriage take place,
young Lennart, who has always
wanted to be a farmer, would be
sheared of his title of Royal High
ness and the right to succession to
the throne.
While no official statement was
forthcoming from the palace, news
was circulated in sources close to
the court that King Gustave had
forbidden the love match.
