Stanford's Five Hundred will not
swing racquets against the women
of the University of California, as
suggested by Helen Wills Moody in
her wish for the establishment
of women's intercollegiate tennis
matches.
Until Stanford withdraws its
membership from the Athletic Con
ference of American College Wo
men, the Farm women cannot com
pete against the women athletes of
any other university.
The American Conference, to
which and California also be
long, supports the system of niixed
collegiate "play day," a women's
field meet for the display of all
sports, with pre-eminence to no one
university.
The Stanford Women's Athletic
Association, however, gains little
satisfaction from hockey played with
California back, Stanford wing, and
Mills goalie. Or from tennis where
two Stanford women play against

each other, one to share the glory
! of the other's defeat with a player
from an alien campus.
Athletic coaches at California op-
I pose the straightforward competition
which Stanford favors. Main reasons
offered are that, the girls "enter too
strenuously into the game," and
that women's athletics, like the
men's, would develop into "com
mercial enterprise."
Stanford is to be hostess to Pacific
Coast colleges at ttyc "play day" in
1 spring quarter. Tennis and golf en
thusiasts are hoping that after that
J obligation is discharged, withdrawal
from the Conference may be brought
' about.
Tennis and goli offer the most in
teresting fields for rivalry. These
! sports, besides their universal ap
peal, individual effort, and continu
ance after college, lack the faint
savor of rah-rahism, and the heart
breaking effort which the Confer
ence fears is characteristic of team
sports.
