# FILIPINO VETERANS REFUSE TO UNITE WITH ROXAS GROUP
## 
### 
MANILA, Feb. 1. (/P)â€”The Fili
pino Veterans Association at the an
nual convention today voted solidly
against affiliating with the Bagong
Katipunan, the brain child of Man
uel Roxas, designed to unify vari
eus elements behind the Philippine
independence campaign. Roxas is
speaker of the Insular House of
Representatives.
General Emilio Aguinaldo, leader
of the Filipino insurrection against
the United States and president of
the veterans association, had been
rxpected to attack the new party.
Instead he limited himself to saying
it looked like a trick to win more
votes for the Nationalista party and
to a statement that Filipino national
unity could not be attained through
resorting to schemes of defying the
sovereign power of the United
States.
