The recent visit of Helen W ills Moody, former C alifornia stu
dent and queen of women tennis players, to the campus again brings
forth the present ridiculous program of intercollegiate sports for
women.
Women's intercollegiate athletics are not intercollegiate in any
sense of the word. True it is that fair athletes from Stanford. Cali
fornia, and Mills gather annually for the triangular sports day, hut
competition at that meet is run on an interclass basis.
The Athletic Conference of American College Women and the
women's section of the .National Amateur Athletic Federation, of
which most American universities, including Stanford, are members,
forbids intercollegiate competition, holding that such activity forces
women "too strenuously" into the game and may result in physical
injuries.
Mrs. Moody's own program of tennis four or five times a week
with competition in numerous tournaments as well is an adequate
rebuttal to the "too strenuous" argument. She characterizes present
interclass competition as "silly."
It is quite possible that the opinion of a world-famous feminine
athlete who has suffered no ill effects from a sports program far
more strenuous than intercollegiate athletics, is thoroughly as reli
able as that of the directors of the A.C.A.CAV. and the X.A.A.F.
Intercollegiate competition would inject new life and interest in
the women's sports program. Stanford women and their sisters
across the Ha\ might well withdraw from the near-sighted national
bodies, and institute an intercollegiate program of their own.
