# WHO CONTRIBUTED TO PALO ALTO'S GROWTH?
## 
### 
I lie recent suggestion of Dr. liertha Dynient. medical adviser of
women, that a lloor in the new Palo \lto Hospital he set aside for
Stanford students has brought .about an indignant outburst from
our i'alo \lto neighbors.
The I'alo \lto Times is emphatic in "dinging" the idea, declaring,
"on mi ground does that request for preferential accommodation of
students find justification. . . . The student enrollment at Stanford
is approximately 3.500. or one-fourth the size of the population of
the tit\ of I'alo Alto. Ily this ratio, the students are by no means
entitled to any such proportion of exclusive claim on the institution
as Dr. Dvmcnt proposes."
Saturday Comptroller Roth reassured I'alo \ltans. stating that
at no time have Stanford authorities responsible for the management
of the new hospital had anv idea of establishing a student infirmary
in this hospital, nor of giving any preferential treatment to students
or others connected with the university.
Dr. Dyment asked for a lloor for students in the new hospital,
i; is true; but she did not ask that students he given preference in
any way, but only that more adequate accommodations for them
be provided. With the completion of the new hospital, ample accom
modations will be available for both students and I 'alo Alto residents.
The fundamental idea on which f)r. Dyment's statement was
based seems not to have been that students be given preference in
the matter of hospital treatment, but that they be provided with more
complete care by the I'niversity health services.
Kverv cent of student-contributed health fees is being spent by
the I'niversity for hospitalization and the medical services, the re
cent report of Dr. Thomas \. Storey shows. The report indicates
lhat this service is more extensive than in past years and is, mirier the
['resent plan of operation, the most complete obtainable.
I Jut the questions may still be asked : Is the present plan of opera
lion the wisest and best for all concerned, the students and I'niver
sity? Might not a rebudgeting of available funds make possible a
more complete and better student health service?
