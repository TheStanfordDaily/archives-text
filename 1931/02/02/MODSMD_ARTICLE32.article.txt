TWO THIEVES—By Manuel Kom
roff. Coward, McCaun. N.Y. 1031.
(At the Palo Alto Hook Shop.)
Two thieves, riding, stealing, plot
ting recklessly to wrest Judea from
the rule of Pilate and restore it to
the Jews; two thieves entering the
tomb of Herod, kidnapping three
Greek girls in order to obtain Pi
late's all-powerful signature; two
thieves who separate, with success
in sight, only to have their plot fail
through the untimely death of the
Rabbi, who was tq be king.
Komroff may twist historic facts a
bit, but he makes thereby a more
exciting story—a story that with all
its ridiculous humor is interesting.
"Two Thieves" lacks the thematic
power of "Coronet." It is absurd at
times. But it is pure adventure, situ
ated in the Holy Land of long ago,
written with a modern style and
Komroffian intensity, which make
it "all right" while it lasts, but noth
ing that one remembers long or
cares to read again. —-J. N.
OLD ENGLISH—At the Varsity.
"Old English" is playing a three
day return engagement at popular
request. The picture is so old and
George Arliss is so popular that it is
hard to imagine there are still many
theatre-goers who have not enjoyed
this picture.
"Old English," written by John

' Galsworthy and a former stage suc-
I cess of Arliss, is well filmed. Espe-
J cially commendable is the splendid
casting, and the good sense of the
Hollywood director who was con
! tent to leave the original dialogue
j intact.
With the exception of the Hearst
Metrotone Reel of Joffre's impres
sive military funeral, the bill is
I poor. „ —B. P.
UNDER SUSPICION—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
j Pleasant and wholesome. The
Northwest Mounted appears as a
| genial, well-groomed boy who en
joys quaffing beer and singing in the
i approved "spirited" fashion. The
j hero is an utter paragon of good
, looks and fearlessness, and that
hurts some, but he has a nice per
! sonality. Lois Moran adorns the pic
ture agreeably, looking very sweet
j and flower-like in clinging chiffon
! affairs that set the child off very
well in contrast to the dashing, stal
j wart hero.
The best action comes in the air
plane rescue made at an enormously
! convincing hazard of life in the
! midst of a forest fire that defies con
i trol. The shots in this scene are
effective and thrilling. The plot is
j the type that unfolds itself just as
: you knew it would after the first
! five minutes, but you don't mind.
