CAN HONOR ISE TEMPTED?
The Editor, Sir:
An article in the Campus Opinion
of January 28 suggests that the
present and proposed methods of
I enforcing the Honor Code upon this
campus are an "insull" to Stanford
students. Yet it seems to the present
writer that the article itself is the
greatest "insult" yet put forth upon
the subject. Let us examine Mr.
! Jameson's premises.
Honor, says he, wisely following
; in the footsteps of Mr. Webster (and
in the style of the eminent "Call-
Bulletin") is "a nice sense of what
is right, just, and true, with strict
conformity thereto." Now, even if
i we concede that one can be honor
i able where no other pathway but
honesty is available. I doubt if it will
j be maintained that dishonorable
conduct is less dishonorable because
jit is the result of yielding to a temp
j tation to be dishonorable. Tha true
| test of honor comes only where
! there is some incentive to do some

' thing other than what is honorable.
Mr. Jamesson tells us that we have
a gradepoint system at Stanford
which tempts us to violate the Honor
Code, and he has the effrontery to
tell us that the only way to make
us honorable is to remove tempta
tion from our paths! If so, we have
no honor at all!
The Executive Committee, unlike
! Mr. Jameson, is willing to face the
facts. It has more faith than he in
the majority of Stanford students,
and believes that we can be honest
jin the face of temptation. Yet it
I i-ecogni7.es the fact that there are
I among us some who are without
j honor, and takes steps to protect us
j from them. In a system of grading
I which is frankly competitive, that
! protection is essential. I hold no brief
j for the "Grade Point" system. But
j here it is, and we must make the
i best of it. If anyone needs more
! faith in the honor of the Stanford
I student, it is Mr. Jameson,
i Ben C. Duniway.
