# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Monday morning cabbages are '
getting to be almost completely j
healthy, flourishing ones, thanks to
seven or eight hoopsters a week.
Long may they continue to call the ,
sunny southland names, if it's going
to give us a winning score to boast
about.
I
At least three Stanford students j
took the trouble to drop in at the (
Assembly Hall Friday night—and j
those three wore greeted by THE
production of their college careers.
Cabbages is neither a reviewing
column nor a news box, and tends
more to mentioning thorns than
roses, but "Wings Over Europe," as I
the campus cast presented it, was j
something to be remembered long
after all the Gaieties chorus girls
have rheumatism.
We did take pains to listen to
that orchestra, too, feeling in a bo
queting mood—and military marches
are fine and inspiring. But, when it
comes to playing "Ave Maria" dur
ing a recess of the British Prime
Minister's Cabinet, something must
be said or done. We remotely
thought that recesses were for
cigarettes and lemon cokes—but
worshipping? No.
After two hours of deep con
sultation with three of those
sorority women we insulted last
week, Cabbages has decided to j
go in for serious reform of kol
lcge kustoms. aided and abetted
by ail of the five hundred who
want a better world to queen in. j
The idea is to systematize dating. !
or at least the acquiring of dates, i
During formal rushing, we are told,

the rushee is given a particular
formula with which to answer in
vitations, either positively or nega
tively. Applying the same tactics to
the question in hand:
Joe Spitz calls for Mary Tobacco-
King, and says, "Mary, my room
mate and his girl friend and and I
request the pleasure of your com
pany at a dinner dance, Friday eve
ning, February sixth, at 8 o'clock.
Will you be able to come?"
Mary coughs, fumbles for her
neighbor's handkerchief, and re
plies, "I'm sorry, I cannot accept
your invitation because I have a
conflict."
Then, of course, it's up to Joe
to fix it up for some other time.
But if, at this first invitation, she
simply says that she cannot ac
cept the dale, it's definitely over
with. Joe says he is sorry, and
that he hopes he will see her
wearing his favorite enemy's
fraternity pin in the near future,
and everyone is happy.
At least, the University wou,ld be
spared the expense of dragging
Lagnuita's bottom for broken hearts.

simply says that she cannot ac

Simple, what?
Monday morning cabbages are '
getting to be almost completely j
healthy, flourishing ones, thanks to
seven or eight hoopsters a week.
Long may they continue to call the ,
sunny southland names, if it's going
to give us a winning score to boast
about.
I
At least three Stanford students j
took the trouble to drop in at the (
Assembly Hall Friday night—and j
those three wore greeted by THE
production of their college careers.
Cabbages is neither a reviewing
column nor a news box, and tends
more to mentioning thorns than
roses, but "Wings Over Europe," as I
the campus cast presented it, was j
something to be remembered long
after all the Gaieties chorus girls
have rheumatism.
We did take pains to listen to
that orchestra, too, feeling in a bo
queting mood—and military marches
are fine and inspiring. But, when it
comes to playing "Ave Maria" dur
ing a recess of the British Prime
Minister's Cabinet, something must
be said or done. We remotely
thought that recesses were for
cigarettes and lemon cokes—but
worshipping? No.
After two hours of deep con
sultation with three of those
sorority women we insulted last
week, Cabbages has decided to j
go in for serious reform of kol
lcge kustoms. aided and abetted
by ail of the five hundred who
want a better world to queen in. j
The idea is to systematize dating. !
or at least the acquiring of dates, i
During formal rushing, we are told,

the rushee is given a particular
formula with which to answer in
vitations, either positively or nega
tively. Applying the same tactics to
the question in hand:
Joe Spitz calls for Mary Tobacco-
King, and says, "Mary, my room
mate and his girl friend and and I
request the pleasure of your com
pany at a dinner dance, Friday eve
ning, February sixth, at 8 o'clock.
Will you be able to come?"
Mary coughs, fumbles for her
neighbor's handkerchief, and re
plies, "I'm sorry, I cannot accept
your invitation because I have a
conflict."
Then, of course, it's up to Joe
to fix it up for some other time.

simply says that she cannot ac
