# ENGLISHMAN IS TRYING TO BEAT 231 RECORD
## 
### 
DAYTONA BEACH. Flo., Feb. 1.
{/¥) —Fifteen seconds may be only
<t fleeting period of time to some
people but to a man driving an auto
mobile 200 miles an hour or more it
seems like an age.
Take it from Captain Malcolm
Campbell, of England, who is here
waiting favorable conditions to at
tack the world's speed record of 231
miles an hour.
If Campbell can cover a mile twice
in the average time of 15 seconds
for each run he will set a new
world's record of 240 miles an hour
—four miles a minute. But to him,
he says, those few seconds will seem
'•'eternity." *
