HOOI'S, MY DEAR

Good old Joe Pandemonium
reigned in the Pavilion here Sat
urday night when the Stanford
students did their best to lift
the roof during the closing min
utes of the Bruin-Indian tilt. No
less a person than Coach John
W. Bunn admits that the noise
warmed his heart, and that the
cheering did much to put fight
into the hearts of the varsity.
But one thing is certain—that j
much of the noise directed at the j
referees went against the f-rain or]
the Stanford coach. After all, Fitz- j
patrick and Kay are the best men
available, they do their work im
partially, and they are conscientious j
in calling all they see.
Too often the crowd yelps
when the referees are right.
Broken dribbles, charging, and
walking penalties seem to call
forth the wrath of the crowd,
and nine times out of ten the
referees are correct and the mob
in error. A broken dribble, for
instance, may be classified as
any dribble during which the
player loses control of the bail,
then regains it, and continues
the dribble.
Yet when a player stumbles over
Ihe ball in his dribble, and continues i
to pat it down the court, a crowd ■
will rise in wrath at the whistle, j
Another point, often overlooked by
the bleacher coaches, is the fact that
in starting a dribble, walking is apt
to be called.
In starting a dribble, a player
is allowed one step, and NO
MORE. As soon as he picks up
his foot for the second step, a
player is walking. Thus, a player
must bounce the ball before
moving his foot, and close at
tention to the footwork will con
vince any doubting Thomas that
he has been wrong in boohing
the referee for many decisions
on this rule.
To add one more point—charging |
may be defined as a dribbler dash- '
ing into the player guarding him.
For instance —A, the guard, stands
near the basket when B, dribbling
in, crashes into him. The foul is on
B for not avoiding the man. If A,
however, moves out of his position
to block the shot and bumps into
B, the foul is on A. If both are
equally responsible, a double foul
.should be called.
But enough of rules. Stanford
is now tied for second place in ,
the Conference race, with a hare
chance to win the league cham
pionship if the Indians can come j
through in their remaining
games. From the past few epics, j
that Cardinal crew is never j
beaten until the final gun goes,
either, for against California and
U.C.L.A., the old hall game was
won in the closing seconds.
*' ' !
Phil MofTatt, with 12 points, again
took high scoring honors against the
Uelans, while he shared the spot
light with Vance Fawcett for gen- J
eral all-round play. It was Vance j
whose long shots first put the In- !
diar.s up there, and then finally won :
the tilt for Stanford. Baker and I
Doub, playing the bulk of a Confer
ence game for the first time, com
ported themselves well.
Those poor unfortunates who
missed Saturday night's engage
ment arc more to be pitied than
blamed. That, boys and girls,
was a ball game. Just about one
more evening like it and the
B.A.C. can remove the seats
from the Pavilion, although it j
might be well to fence off the
playing area before the student i
body attempts to serpentine on
a basketball court. —L. K., Jr.
