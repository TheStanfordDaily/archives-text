# Freshmen Cagers Trounce Fresno High, 24-14
## SUPERIOR HEIGHT GIVES REDSHIRTS EASY ENCOUNTER Packard Takes High Score Honors; Substitutes Show Ability 
### 
Superior height and a superior ]
system of play gave the freshman j
basketball team a 24-14 victory over ■
Fresno High in a game preceding j
the varsity clash last Saturday eve- j
ning in the Pavilion.
It was the Bunn system of play j
which enabled the frosh to pierce j
the Fresno defense and work the j
ball in under the hoop; it was their j
height which enabled them to lay j
in the buckets after they had fol- I
lowed their season-long habit of :
missing set-ups.
Fresno Outclassed
Fresno had no definite system for j
working the ball down the court j
and therefore no chance of pene- |
trating the freshman defense. As a j
result they were forced to resort to j
hope shots from far out, and al- ;
1 hough Rustegan and Emerzian, i
their outstanding players, sank one j
or two of these, Fresno never had a I
chance of matching their opponents' j
constantly mounting total.
Working out an 8-2 lead at ihe j
quarter, the freshmen increased this j
to 17-6 at half time. Bunn sent in 1
his reserves to start the second half, ,
and Fresno made its best showing !
of the evening, pulling up to 17-11 j
on two buckets by Rustegan. One j
of these was the prettiest shot of the j
game. Rustegan, dribbling down one |
side of the court and hemmed in by i
i'ed jerseys, cut loose with a one- j
hand toss which did not even touch j
the iron on its way through the
hoop.
Regulars Shine
Injection of the regulars during
the closing minutes of the game ran
the score up to 24-14 before the final
gun.
The chief thorn in the side of the
Fresnians all evening was Packard, :
lofty frosh center. During the three
quarters that he was in the game
he accounted for nine points. His !
alert play under the basket, com
bined with his reach, were the chief .
factors in his showing. He exhibited
signs of becoming expert at the art j
of handling backboard rebounds.
Jenkins, Stanford guard, also I
turned in a nice game. Twice oppor
tune breaks and a good eye got him
buckets.
Like the varsity, the freshmen
have capable reserves. This was
demonstrated again by the showing
the second string made against '
Fresno while they were in. Panero,
Massey, and Seaver, all of whom
have seen much service during the
season, all turned in good games
during their short stay.

trating the freshman defense. As a j
result they were forced to resort to j
hope shots from far out, and al- ;
1 hough Rustegan and Emerzian, i
their outstanding players, sank one j
or two of these, Fresno never had a I
chance of matching their opponents' j
constantly mounting total.
Working out an 8-2 lead at ihe j
quarter, the freshmen increased this j
to 17-6 at half time. Bunn sent in 1
his reserves to start the second half, ,
and Fresno made its best showing !
of the evening, pulling up to 17-11 j
on two buckets by Rustegan. One j
of these was the prettiest shot of the j
game. Rustegan, dribbling down one |
side of the court and hemmed in by i
i'ed jerseys, cut loose with a one- j
hand toss which did not even touch j
the iron on its way through the
hoop.
Regulars Shine
Injection of the regulars during
the closing minutes of the game ran
the score up to 24-14 before the final
gun.
The chief thorn in the side of the
Fresnians all evening was Packard, :
lofty frosh center. During the three
quarters that he was in the game
he accounted for nine points. His !
alert play under the basket, com
bined with his reach, were the chief .
factors in his showing. He exhibited
signs of becoming expert at the art j
of handling backboard rebounds.
Jenkins, Stanford guard, also I
turned in a nice game. Twice oppor
tune breaks and a good eye got him
buckets.
Like the varsity, the freshmen
have capable reserves. This was
demonstrated again by the showing
the second string made against '
Fresno while they were in. Panero,
Massey, and Seaver, all of whom
have seen much service during the
season, all turned in good games
during their short stay.
Superior height and a superior ]
system of play gave the freshman j
basketball team a 24-14 victory over ■
Fresno High in a game preceding j
the varsity clash last Saturday eve- j
ning in the Pavilion.
It was the Bunn system of play j
which enabled the frosh to pierce j
the Fresno defense and work the j
ball in under the hoop; it was their j
height which enabled them to lay j
in the buckets after they had fol- I
lowed their season-long habit of :
missing set-ups.
Fresno Outclassed
Fresno had no definite system for j
working the ball down the court j
and therefore no chance of pene- |
trating the freshman defense. As a j
result they were forced to resort to j
hope shots from far out, and al- ;
1 hough Rustegan and Emerzian, i

or two of these, Fresno never had a I
