Track Coach Dink Templeton will
have good reason to congratulate
himself if Elbert Sellers, former
University of Washington track star,
makes good his anounced intention
of entering Stanford for a pre-medi

of the Pacific Coast, will compete
for the Olympic Club this season,
but will have a year of competition
at Stanford.

track reinforcement from Washing

the southern institution.
