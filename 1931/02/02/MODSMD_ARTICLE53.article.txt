# SPEAKING OF VAULTS
## Sturdy, of Yale, May Make Another 14-Foot-Vault in Millrose Games To Be Held on February 7 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Now that the indoor track season j
is getting under way in New York,
look for another 14-foot-vault, be
cause the high-school kids are doing :
13 feet nowadays, and it wasn't so
long ago that that height was looked
up to as the ultimate "ceiling" in
vaulting efforts. Fred Sturdy, that ;
long, gangling, likeable kid from
Los Angeles, who is taking post
graduate work at Yale, may vault 14 j
feet on February 7 next when he j
competes in the annual Millrose
games in Madison Square Garden,
New York City. But if he does, it
won't be the first time Fred has
cleared that height, nor would it be
the first time that one vaulter has
reached that dizzy altitude for the
second time.
First Vault
Back in 1927, at the 1.C.4-A. games
at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, Sa
bin Carr of Yale made the first 14-
foot-vault in athletic history. Nine
months later "Sabe" cleared 14 feet
1 inch in an indoor meet in the
Garden. Two months after that, Lee

' Barnes, who had tied for first in the
pole-vault at the Olympics in Paris
in 1924, when he was just a school
boy, vaulted 14 feet lV'a inches out
doors in California. That mark is
now the accepted world's record.
Carr, however, was a better vaulter
than Barnes, and always beat hum
I except once, at the final Olympic
tryouts in 1928, when Carr was sick.
Carr Winner
| Carr won at Amsterdam, in the
rain, but Barnes (with Carr absent)
won at Stamford Bridge a couple
of weeks later in typical "California
weather," setting a new British rec
ord of 13:9.
While on the subject of vaulters,
it is my opinion that Charley HofT,
that great Norwegian athlete who
was disqualified by the A.A.U. a
few years ago, could have cleared
14 feet almost any time he cared.
Oscar Sutermeister of Harvard is
probably the most promising vaulter
today. If well coached, he has the
natural ability and the build to do
14:4 or even more.
