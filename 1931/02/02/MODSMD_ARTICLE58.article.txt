### Lowell Cox 
Demonstrating that Stanford has
a polo team capable of giving battle
to any collegiate quartet in the
country, the Redshirt four Friday
afternoon overwhelmed the crack
Presidio of San Francisco riders, 10
to 4, in a fast game played on the
highway field.
After being held even for two
chukkers, the Cardinals found a
stride which surprised the veteran
Army team with its aggressiveness.
The second period ended in a 2 to 2
lie, after which Stanford was never
headed.
McDougall Stars
Captain Jack McDougall was the
outstanding player of the field, scor
ing three goals for the Redshirts
and stopping many Presidio attacks
1 with his brilliant riding and stick
work.
After Captain McCrystal scored
the opening 'goal, McDougal took
the ball down the field to scoring
position, where Spalding sent it
through the goal posts to even the
j count.
Gorham Scores
Gorham fiashed brilliantly in the
j third period, scoring two goals in
| rapid succession after McDougall
had opened the chukker with a tally
' on a penalty shot from the 20-yard
line. Gorham took the ball 100 yards
! for his first score and 150 yards for
j his second to give Stanford a 5 to 2
j lead as the bell tolled at half time.
With Carter and Clausen replac
ing Spalding and Gorham at No. 1
I and No. 2 positions, the Redshirts
! continued their drive in the second
1 half. Fleming accounted for two
| goals in the fourth chukker, the first
! of which went 50 yards to curve
I through the posts.
Closing Attack
A determined Presidio attack held
: the Redshirts in check in the clos
| ing period and netted them their
! fourth taliy.
i Every one of Ihe six Stanford men
| used in the game played splendid
! poro. each accounting for at least
! one goal. Besides McDougall, Gor-
I ham and Fleming are deserving of
| particular mention.
; Captain Kilburn was the out
j standing Army player, although he
( did not score. Lieutenant Mathews
