Last Friday's varsity practice
track meet, although featured by
excellent early season winning times
on the track and good marks in the
field events, which presage a strong
Indian bid this spring for the Pacific
Coast and national honors, was
1 marred by a small tragedy in the |
; injury of Arnie West.

in last year's 1.C.4-A. meet, won the
