"Instead of carrying a Bible to
the native, I would carry a pump."
Thus did Dr. Bailey Willis, emeritus
professor of geology, speaking to a
group in Encina Hall last evening,
metaphorically set forth his idea of
the only effective method of pro
moting civilization in Africa.
Describing social conditions in
Uganda as compared with those in
the Cape Colony, Dr. Willis pointed
out the totally different method of
the British in handling natives in
the former area. This method, of
gradually and slowly raising their
civilization by placing advanced
ideas in their way rather than for
cibly inculcating modern doctrines
into their heads is, he said, the only
true way of raising the civilization
of these people, and he was hearty
in his praise of the British method
in this area of some 5,000,000 na
tives and but 200 whites.
