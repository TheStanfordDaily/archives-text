# RELIGION IS LOYALTY TO IDEALS â€“ GARDNER
## 
### 
"We come to church to prove our
loyalty to the great principles of
j life, such as truth, love, and good
i ness, and because we believe that
I they are bound up in the idea of
j God," said the Reverend D. Charles
! Gardner, University chaplain, in his
| sermon yesterday morning.
Dr. Gardner took as the text of
his sermon the words of Saint Paul:
j "Whatsoever things are true, what
soever things are honorable, what
soever things are pure, whatsoever
things are in report, think of
these things." Holy Communion was
celebrated immediately after the
I service.
