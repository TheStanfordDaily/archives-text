# B.A.C. TO PERMIT CONCESSION SALE FOR GYM BENEFIT
## California Track Meet And Baseball Game Will Be Scene of Sale 
### 
Women .students of the University i
will sell concessions at the California |
track meet and the third baseball
game with California, April 18, the
Board of Athletic Control decided at
its monthly meeting Friday night.
Permission for the women to sell
the concessions was granted after a
deputation of students and alumni
visited the board and requested lhat
Ihoy be allowed to vend goods at the
sports events on April 18, which is
University Day.
Money to be raised from the sale
will go toward the purchase of fur
nishings for the new women's gym
nasium.
The concessions will be sold both
inside and outside the stadium and
baseball diamond bleachers, the
board ruled. The board's decision is
a departure from a long-established
rule permitting no concessions in
side the stadium or the baseball
bleachers. The B.A.C. permits no
sale of concessions by outsiders.
The board also reduced the fee
charged outsidei's for playing on
the Stanford golf course during the
week-end from $4 to $3. The board
said a larger number of outside
players could be expected to use
the course if the rate was reduced. !
