WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (A 3 ).â€”The I
large-sized bank notes, which were j
abandoned 19 months ago in favor i
of smaller currency, rapidly are dis- !
appearing from the nation's pocket
book.
They have been replaced so rap
idly that only about one-eighth of a j
total of nearly $5,000,000,000 still is
outstanding. |
