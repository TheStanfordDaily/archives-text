# MACMILLAN TO TELL OF NORTH
## Pictures To Illustrate Deeds Of Explorer 
### 
Commander Donald B. MacMillan,
well-known arctic explorer, will tell
of his experiences during 20 years
of exploration in the far North to
morrow night in the Assembly Hall
at 7:30 o'clock.
He will have with him 50 colored
slides and will use six reels of mo
tion pictures to illustrate his lecture
on "Under the Northern Lights."
MacMillan's selection of still and
motion pictures of life in the arctic
is one of the best in existence and
is exceptionally interesting and
spectacular, according to Professor
E. A. Cottrell, who considers the ex
plorer one of the most interesting
men ever secured for a campus lec
ture.
On Peary Trip
MacMillan v/ent to the North for
the first time with Rear Admiral
R. E. Peary on the North Pole ex
pedition of 1908. Since that time he
has made 12 more trips and has
lived with and studied five different
Eskimo tribes.
Last June, for the first time in 20
years, MacMillan and his party for
sook their research work in the Arc
tic to visit Iceland, where a unique
historical celebration was held. It
was a celebration of the one thou
sandth anniversary of the founding
of the Icelandic Parliament, the old
est parliament in Europe.
Is Author
MacMillan is now professor of an
thropology at Bowdoin College. He
has written "Four Years in the
White North,'' "Etah and Beyond,"
"Kah-da. The Life of an Eskimo
Boy," and is working on two more
books at present.
The commander has the distinc
tion of being the first explorer to
use the radio successfully, 1923. Not
only was the radio a great addition
to his party, but the messages and
special programs were of special in
terest to the Eskimos.
MacMillan will also be the guest
speaker tomorrow at a joint meeting
of the Palo Alto service clubs. Res
ervations for luncheon can be made
