Beer. ,
They pledge them with it in Ger
man fraternities. And they make
the "sophomores" furnish it after
they pledge.
It's a pleasant custom, and only
one of a number of interesting ones
volunteered by Christian Carstensen,
a transfer from the University of
Kiel in Schleswig-Holstein, at Stan
ford.
Carstensen, who has also attended
the University of Freiburg in the
Black Forest, and the University of
Koenigsberg in East Prussia, was the
guest of the local committee of the
National Student Federation of
America at the Fellowship tea Fri
day afternoon.
"German schools militaristic? Not
so. That's only an American impres
sion and an eroneous one. I had to
come to Stanford to take military,"
said Carstensen. "Fencing is the
nearest to a military science and
that is only prevalent among fra
ternities."
Scars are still enviable marks and
friendly duels are common outside
the city limits. "Fraternity pledges
hold contests with rival houses but
casualties are usually limited to the
loss of an ear or section of the
scalp," he added.
Since a large portion of the Ger
man population is female, there is

I much competition among the wom
; en, and although co-education is
common, women students arc for the
; most part ignored—a situation which
: apparently doesn't exist at Stanford,
he declared.
I Carstensen commented upon the
systematized studying in the Ameri
| can universities. "At home, he said,
j "examinations are only given at the
! end of four years' work. Then there
is a six months' period of prepara
: tion for them. If a student fails in
j the examinations he may take them
! over. They are usually passed the
! second time."
Since most of the German colleges
are located in large cities, Carsten
sen noticed the lack'of school spirit
there which is prevalent in Ameri-
I can universities. "Students major
ing in the same subjects live to
j gether in boarding houses, but fra
j ternitics are not used for room and
board, only for meeting and drink
' ing places." Food is much cheaper
: in Germany, and 15-cent meals are
1 common. When one is very hungry,
1 one gets a 30-cent dinner, he said.
Despite the differences in student
life here and abroad, Carstensen de
clared the students were the same,
. had much the same interests and
pastimes. "They are especially alike
I in their way of doing school work,"
ij he added.

Scars are still enviable marks and
friendly duels are common outside
the city limits. "Fraternity pledges
hold contests with rival houses but
casualties are usually limited to the

I Carstensen commented upon the
systematized studying in the Ameri

is a six months' period of prepara

j the examinations he may take them

Since most of the German colleges
are located in large cities, Carsten
sen noticed the lack'of school spirit
there which is prevalent in Ameri-
I can universities. "Students major
ing in the same subjects live to
j gether in boarding houses, but fra
j ternitics are not used for room and
board, only for meeting and drink
' ing places." Food is much cheaper
: in Germany, and 15-cent meals are
1 common. When one is very hungry,
1 one gets a 30-cent dinner, he said.
Despite the differences in student
life here and abroad, Carstensen de
clared the students were the same,
. had much the same interests and
pastimes. "They are especially alike
I in their way of doing school work,"
ij he added.
