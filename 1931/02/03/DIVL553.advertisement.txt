Today's swift pace calls for
accurate tireless vision. If
you cannot see easily, clearly,
without strain or fatigue,
your eyes need attention.
Perhaps you need glasses.
If you do, modern lenses in
their new inconspicuous
frames will give your eyes
surprising comfort.
The only eyes you'll ever
have deserve the best of care.
Come in and let us examine
them.
