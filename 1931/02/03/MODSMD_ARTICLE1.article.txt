# PHI KAPS WIN FROM D.U.'S IN OVERTIME TILT
## Sigma Chi, 30 Champions, Win Third Straight From Encina 2W DEKES GAIN THIRD WIN 
### 
Phi Kappa Sigma boat off a grim
assault of Delta Upsilon 21-1!) in an
extra period play to take a victory
in the most spectacular game of last
night's intramural cage play.
Theta Delta Chi smeared El
Cuadro 21-9, Delta Kappa Epsilon
drew a hot Haattle out of the fire
with a 13-8 count, and Sigma Chi,
defending champions, walked away
from Encina 2W in other encounters.
Tonight's games include Beta
Theta Pi vs. Sigma Nu in the gym
at 7 o'clock, and the Vagabonds vs.
Alpha Delta Phi in the gym at 8
o'clock. Kappa Alpha draws a bye.
D.U. Ties Score
The Phi Kappa Sig-Delta Upsilon
broil contained an abundance of
thrills. Trailing throughout the
game, the D.U.'s crawled up within
striking distance and then crashed
through to tie the game up when
Rendle nicked the ring for a basket
and a free throw to make the score
17. up.
In the beginning of the extra
period Rendle came through again
with another basket to put the
D.U.'s out in front for the first time
in the game. Their lead was short
lived, however, as Rendle left the
game on fouls and Woodworth drew
blood twice for the frantic Phi Kaps
to put the game on ice. Woodworth
and Rendle led their respective
teams for high scoring honors with
12 points a piece.
A.K.L. Leads at Half
The A.K.L.-Dekes was another
torrid affair. The Dekes were
checked throughout the first half
and at the rest period were clinging
to the short end of a 6 to 4 score.
The A.K.L. defense was outstanding
during the whole of the game, but
they lacked a consistent offensive
threat. The Deke scoring power was
not to be denied and they eked out
enough counters to peg the score at
13 to 8. Warren accounted for eight
of the Dekes' 13 points.
Cuadro Shots Wild
The El Cuadro-Theta Delta Chi
fray was rough and tumble, with
the Row men making their shots
count. El Cuadro had ample oppor
tunities to score but couldn't find
the ring. Romiez led Theta Delta Chi
scorers with 9 points.
The Sigma Chi-Encina fray was a
weird game. Encina managed to col
lect two free throws to account for
their evening's scoring efforts. Gold
water went wild for Sigma Chi,
easing eleven field goals and a free
throw into the net for an aggregate
of 23 points.
