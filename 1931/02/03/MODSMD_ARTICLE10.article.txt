### COLLIER CONNELL 
New and significant data about
inhabitants of the Stanford Farm
has been gleaned from Leonard C.
Ward, caricaturist, who has sketched
cartoons of more than 900 Stanford
students during his past week's work
along the Row and at Roble.
Ward, who visited Stanford three
years ago, is en route to the uni
versities of Washington and Oregon
to continue his caricaturing of the
western collegian. He maintained a
studio at Berkeley during Autumn
Quarter.
''Stanford students hatfe an active
sense of humor," says Ward. "Berke
ley students look at their caricatures
and offer a high-class smirk. Stan
ford looks, and yells with joy."
Ward has. an acute perception of

personality, as well as an amazing t
| skill with the artist's pencil. He j
I takes, a general impression of the
; person, a glance at the profile, and
! completes a penciled sketch within
| ten seconds to half a minute. Inking
the lines requires two minutes.
Ward admits that he is harder on i
the men than on the women. "A |
woman's caricature, no matter how j
exaggerated, must retain a sweet ;
expression," he contends. Roble wo- j
men who posed for him Friday i
night are inclined to doubt the prac- '
ticc of his theory.
But Ward's donation to the Wo
men's Gym Fund of 20 per cent of
l his earnings at Roble successfully i
j blunts the sting of any too-skillful ;
i caricatures.
