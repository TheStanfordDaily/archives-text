# STANFORD HIT DEBATE HARVARD
## May Hold Nation-Wide Radio Debate In March 
### 
Following a telegram received
from Harvard by John R. Pascoe,
debate manager, last Friday night,
negotiations have been opened be
tween the eastern university and
Stanford for a nation-wide radio de
bate to be held over the Columbia
Broadcasting system sometime in
March.
The telegram, which expressed a
possibility only, proposed a debate on
some subject of national interest for
which the Stanford team would
broadcast from California with the
Harvard team in Boston. The full
arrangements have not yet been
completed by the Columbia Broad
casting system. The proposal was
met with strong approval by the
Stanford Debate Council at a meet
ing held yesterday afternoon.
Emerson Gives Approval
"We arc delighted with the invi
tation,'' stated J. G. Emerson, debate
coach. "Members of the all-Califor
nia team, captained by Robert Mc-
Clintock, visited Harvard last year
and were greatly pleased with the
treatment accorded them. Although
Harvard is engaging in radio debates
with eastern universities, Stanford
debaters feel signally honored to
have an invitation to engage in what
is very probably the first transcon
tinental intercollegiate debate."
"The fact that Stanford was chosen
shows the debating importance of
Stanford in the eyes of the East,"
believes John R. Puscoc, debate
manager.

A debate with College of the Pa
cific, at Stockton has been scheduled
for February 18, with Stanford tak
ing the negative of the question "Re
solved that the nations should adopt

met with strong approval by the
Stanford Debate Council at a meet
ing held yesterday afternoon.
Emerson Gives Approval
"We arc delighted with the invi
tation,'' stated J. G. Emerson, debate
coach. "Members of the all-Califor
nia team, captained by Robert Mc-
Clintock, visited Harvard last year
and were greatly pleased with the
treatment accorded them. Although
Harvard is engaging in radio debates
with eastern universities, Stanford
debaters feel signally honored to
have an invitation to engage in what
is very probably the first transcon
tinental intercollegiate debate."
"The fact that Stanford was chosen
shows the debating importance of
Stanford in the eyes of the East,"
believes John R. Puscoc, debate
manager.
