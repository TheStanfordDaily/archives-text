# Reserve String To Play Against Tiger Hoopsters Tonight
## Bunn Will Inject All Possible Reserves During Game; Cardinal Second Quintet Should Assure Victory; Odale Sole Tiger Threat 
### JACK JERNEGAN 
rOLLEGK OF THE PACIFIC will come to the campus tonight to play
a game of basketball with the Cardinal second- and third-string
teams. Scheduled to start in the Pavilion at S o'clock, after the freshman
quintets of the two colleges decide the preliminary contest, this practice
game will not be graced by the Stanford regulars except for a few minutes.
Coach John Bunn announced a probable starting lineup yesterday which
included five reserve players. Forwards will be Reggie Meade and lion
Tyler, center, Charles Bonner, and guards, Irwin Tway and John Hancock.

"Tyler was reported down with a
cold, however, and may not be able
to play. If he is out Payne Palmer
will take his place.
Feeling that this is a good chance
to build up his replacement ma
terial, Coach Bunn will inject all of
Ihe reserves for whom he can find
a place during the course of the
game.
Indians Favored
Judging by the season record of
Ihe Pacific team, the Cardinals
should be able to collect a victory
even with the second quintet on the
job. The Tigers have split games
with both San Jose State and St.
; Mary's, tv/o teams which Stanford
defeated quite easily, and have lost
more tilts than they have won this
year.
Odale at center is the only man on
the Pacifie five who has had any
I success in scoring during the season,
j so it looks as if the problem of the
Redskin defense will be to stop that
one man. Odale stands 6 feet 3
inches tall and should give Bonner
plenty of exercise at the center
jump.
Tigers Annoying in Past
A glance at past records of Stan
ford-Tiger games shows that the
Stockton aggregation has not al
ways been easy for the Indians to
down, and indicates that there may
be trouble in store tonight, despite
the previous showing of the Tigers.
In 1927 the score was Stanford 23,
Pacific 15; in 1928 Pacific trounced
the Redshirts by a 29-18 margin; in
1929 it was close, Stanford 34, Pacific
31, while last year Stanford came
I through with a 55-23 decision.
The Cardinal cagers had a com
paratively light workout yesterday
afternoon, a short scrimmage being
prescribed by Coach Bunn. The
first team men did not get in much
' work, but the players who will par
j ticipate in tonight's engagement had
i a few minutes of competitive exer
cise.
