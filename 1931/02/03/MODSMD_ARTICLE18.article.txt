In a lecture entitled "Under the

ald B. MacMillan, daring Arctic ex
plorer, will tell of his experiences
during 20 years of exploration in the
far North, at 7:30 o'clock tonight, in

MacMillan's selection of still and mo
tion pictures of life in the Arctic is
one of the best in existence and is
composed of startling and spectacu
lar scenes, many of which were
taken on his expedition for the Na
tional Geographic Society.
First Arctic Flight
MacMillan has the distinction of
having taken the first aircraft into
the Arctic, with Commander Rich
ard E. Byrd and Floyd Bennett as
pilots, in 1924-25 under the auspices
of the National Geographic Society
and Field Museum Expedition.

Rear Admiral R. E. Peary on the
North Pole expedition of 1908. Since
that time he has made 12 other trips
and has lived with and studied five
different Eskimo tribes.
Established Baffin School
MacMillan carried out Grenfell
work in Baffin Land, and left teach
ers at the northern base, who turn
the place into a school throughout
the winter. Among the historic Arc
tic spots in which the explorer has
stayed is the site of Greeley's Starva
tion Camp at Cape Sabine, where he
erected a memorial tablet to the 18
men who died of starvation in 1884.
Last June, McMillan and his party
forsook their research work in the
Arctic to visit Iceland, where a
unique historical celebration was be
ing held. It was in honor of the
millenial anniversary of the found
ing of the Icelandic Parliament, the
oldest parliament in Europe.
