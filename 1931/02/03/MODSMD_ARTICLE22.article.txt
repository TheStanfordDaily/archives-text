# Economics Expert Says Business Trails Science

### RUTH FISHKR 
i Twentieth century industrial so
ciety has lost pace with the runaway
stride of invention, and is being
! dragged along after it, battered by
I maladjustments.
That is the belief of Dr. Earl Dean
Howard, professor of economics at
j Northwestern University and vice
president of Hart, SchafTner and
Marx Company, who arrived here
j yesterday to give a series of lectures
' before the Graduate School of Busi
! ness on problems of industrial rela
tions.
"The science of business must
1 catch up to the highly developed
physical sciences," Dr. Howard de
clares. "The present depression is
but one indication of the lack of
understanding of modern industrial
complexity."
Business revolves around the four
factors of production, distribution,
control, and mass. The horizon of
business must be widened beyond
I these, to include .i view of indus-

I trial relationships. Society can be
geared to run smoothly when man
regains control of the tremendous
forces of business, and understands
its workings; when he can intelli
gently avoid market crash and
revolution, according to Dr. Howard.
"Business school is a place where
most people send their sons to lear.
to get rich quickly," he said. "In
reality, it is a place to learn the
philosophy of business —to get a
i sweeping view of present-day com
plexities. The business school gradu
| ato should possess the happy art of
i readability, the capacity to think.''
Stanford is one of few universities
j where the method of teaching busi
j ness is being gradually suited to the
I subject, Dr. Howard asserted. Dean
Hotchkiss of the Graduate School of
j Business has been a long-time col
laborator with Dr. Howard, and is
in sympathy with his belief in a
si-mi-Socratic method as the more
I efficient way of teaching business.
