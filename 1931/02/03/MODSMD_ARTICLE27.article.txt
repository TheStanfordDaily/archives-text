The timid "nil ihe fence" policy in regard to Honor Code vio
lations Stanford's .Men's Council has followed during the present
academic year was again evidenced in the latest decision of that
body. \ student, appearing before the council for the third time
charged with violation of the Honor Code, was suspended from
the I.'Diversity for the remainder of the quarter.
The Honor Code is a contract of the students with themselves
not to give or receive unpermitted aid in their examinations and
classvvork. The successful operation of the i lonor Code depends on
its observance by every student. \on-observance merits only one
reward —punishment.
Lenicncv bv the council is permissible, perhaps; in the case of a
student's violation of the Code for the first time. I»ut it is decidedly
ill-advised when it happens in the case of a second or third I lonor
Code violation.
Suspension from the I'niversity for the remainder of the quarter
is not a heavy sentence when it is remembered that the student con
cerned was appearing before the council for the third time charged
with violation of the 1 lonor Code.
If the I lonor Code is laughed at and not observed, it is because
the student bodies formed for its enforcement are afraid to punish
violators as their offenses deserve.
The I lonor Code asks only one thing, that Stanford men and
women behave as university students.
