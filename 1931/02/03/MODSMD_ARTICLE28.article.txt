# ONLY ANOTHER YEAR TO WAIT

### 
Although Stanford women are morally bound to continue the
unsatisfactory "interclass" collegiate athletic competition for the
remainder of the year, since the "500" will he hosts to California
and Mills at the Triangular Kield Day this spring; sentiment ex
pressed by undergraduate women and several members of the phy
sical education faculty indicate that a definite movement to institute
real intercollegiate competition will be undertaken as soon as that
duty is discharged.
As it is doubtful if California and Mills could be persuaded to
withdraw from the Athletic Conference of American College
Women, the national body which forbids intercollegiate athletic
competition for women, before the field day takes place: Stanford
women, who are hosts thi> year, feel that it would be an unfriendly
gesture for them to sever their connections with the A.C.A.C.W .
at this time. It is hoped that next year will see the two Eastbay
institutions joining with Stanford in a general exodus from the
Mid-Victorian regulations of the national body.
The ban on women's intercollegiate athletics is ridiculous, par
ticularly for tennis and golf. "I'ure sport for the sport s sake.'' is
the watchword of the A.C.A.CAV. I hit without the zest and interest
that can only be supplied by intercollegiate competition, a discour
aging small percentage of women are interested in any kind of sport.
Stanford women.need not shed a tear at the thought of severing
their connection with the A.C.A.C.W. benefits derived from mem
bership in that body are still to be discovered, while in return mem
ber universities are bound with a number of antiquated rules and
bans.
1 he "500" should enjoy all the privileges accorded their male
contemporaries in the field o! athletics. Let not this temporary
delav in action weaken the resolve of Stanford s fair athletes to
gain intercollegiate competition.
