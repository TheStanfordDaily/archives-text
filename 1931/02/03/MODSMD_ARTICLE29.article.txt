# THE
						ATHLETIC WHITEWASH
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast Conference is reported to have readied a
verbal agreement to report rumors of subsidization and soliciting of
athletes to the; respective member universities for whom the athletes
are supposed to be competing.
The conference came to this decision after it had failed If) make
anv definite and concrete plans for the abolishment of the evils
attendant upon the present system of intercollegiate competition.
I'nder the conference's new scheme of things, should the uni
versitv hear that loyal supporters of another institution were sup
porting a star athlete while he achieved honor for his alma mater
011 the gridiron or track, the first university would immediately
report it to the second.
This scheme is certainly hunky-dory in its seemingly practical
application. The catch comes when it is realized that the university
concerned is not forced to take official cognizance of the situation
and act upon the information supplied by another institution.
