# Campus Opinion
## DISAGREEING WITH JAMESON 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
On first reading Mr. Jameson's
contribution to last Wednesday's j
I Campus Opinion, I agreed heartily
with his belief in the benefits to be j
. derived from the annihilation of the
I grade system. However, after care- j
ful thought, I find myself unable to j
second hi.s implicit assumption that '
j cheating would be reduced thereby.
If the dividing line between plus
; and minus were the same as that 1
between passing and flunking ac
cording to the grade system, various
as that line may be, it would take
| just as much study to be passed
under the former as under the lat
( ter system, and just as many stu- ;
j dents who did not care to study !
would cheat in order to "get by." I
Attraction To Serious
We may, I realize, validly assume
that such a change would attract i
to the University a more uniformly
serious student element which would !
displace the less serious, but I am ,
rather inclined to doubt it. Diploma i
prestige, hope of social distinction, ;
and campus life, with its freedom J
from home supervision, will con- j
tinue of themselves to form irre- j
sistible lures. j
Of course, the University authori
ties say wh'o is and who is not
eligible to enter the University, but j
the data on which they base their :
choice is often misleading in that it
| does not take into account the pros- ,
pective student's reaction to changed i
! circumstances such as being away
from home, under whose influence
j he may have attained the highest
standing in high school, but away
from whose influence he may find it
i necessary to cheat in order to stay
I in school.
Code Aids Cheating
Nor can an honor code logically
l be expected to dissipate the prob
lem, for it totally misses the student
| who more or less lacks the particu- 1
lar type of honor involved. Cheat
ing during an examination is, if we
j wish to grade evils, a quite minor
offense in its social implications, i
Many a student who would not
; think of purloining his roommate's
comb, suffers no pangs of conscience
when it comes to gleaning informa
tion from his exam-neighbor's cuff.
The honor system is an aid to him.
Suppose Chicago should put the
| matter of adopting the honor system
j to the vote. It is not difficult to
imagine the glee with which the
gangsters would rush to the polls
| and unanimously vote for the meas-
I ure.
Cheating a Habit
The mental carelessness of the
I cheating student is a habit usually
of long standing; and habit, accord
ing to modern psychology, is a
' physical condition of a group of
sensory and motor nerve circuits
' allowing of the comparatively effort
j less completion of the action em
bodied in the habit. Should we ex-
I peel such a physical condition to re
verse itself unailed? The thought is
! totally illogical.
Cheating, as the habit under con
j sideration, must be made more dif

' ficult of accomplishment. Punish
j ment will not do it, for few of
fenders are apprehended. There re
mains only the proctor system. Cer
i tainly I do not regard such a sys
tem as a positive ftrre; and yet the
presence of a proctor during an ex
amination would put a concrete ob
i stacle before the cheater which
| would serve more or less to keep his
bad habit in obeisance, instead of
the mere threat of punishment usu
ally evaded.
Two Choices
After all who is responsible in the
first place for the existence of ex
aminations. The University authori
ties, of course. And is it quite logical
for them to leave the veritable
■ supervision of their examinations to
! the students for whom said examin
i ations are intended as tests of
J knowledge acquired by hard work
I not always done?
Chicago, or even Palo Alto, has
not yet seen fit to discard its police
j department in favor of the honor
j system. Have we, on the whole,
i evolved any farther in the social
j responsibility scale?
! We may take our choice: Assum
-1 ing the retention of written exam
! inations and some kind of final
( marks, whether plus and minus or
A, B, C, D, and E, we may either
junk the false-pride conception of
■ group honor and follow the com
: mon-sense lead of other universities
j in resuming the proctor system, or
i continue, as at present, to contribute
1 to the survival of the unfit.
