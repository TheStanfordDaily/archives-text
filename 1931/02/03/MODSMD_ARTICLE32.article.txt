# THE 						"500" ON SPORTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In Friday's Daily was an article
! which told of Helen Wills Moody's
: opinion of women's intercollegiate
! athletics. I very much agree with
Mrs. Moody, and so am taking this
opportunity to express my opinion
publicly.
I believo that intercollegiate ath
letics would, first of all, make wo
men more interested in taking part
in the sports given here. If they
know there was to be something
gained by their efforts—something
to show for their work —many wo
: men who now consider it a waste of
time would change their minds. And
| health as well as brains are import
ant to everyone, and exercise is
j very necessary for real health.
Secondly, I don't see that any
harm could possibly come,of this,
i As Friday's Daily said, Mrs. Moody
! is a fine example of a woman who
has worked hard and continuously
at a sport, and no one could say it
, has hurt her. Besides, isn't a college
j girl perfectly capable of taking care
i of herself? Doesn't she know when
! she is straining herself? If not, she
doesn't deserve to be a Stanford
i student. A little bit of common
sense is just as important as high
scholastic standing.
I should like to know how the rest
of this Univei'sity feels on this sub
ject. I realize that other colleges
must change their systems before
we could have any competition, but
if Stanford started it I believe many
j would follow. —N. O.
