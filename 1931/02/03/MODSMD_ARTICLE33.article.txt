# Cabbages and Things

### 
I Today we present for your ap
-1 proval an ancient, fable, dug up from
I the annals of the past, the favorite
j moralizing story of the original
j Cabbages.
Once upon a time there was a
very wealthy, healthy young
duffer. Michael, who had re
mained single anyway. He final
ly decided that he would pet
married if he could find the
right kind of a girl. (You can
easily see how that qualification
limited his field of choice.)
He began giving large parties and
inviting all the prospective brides

from miles around. From the first
it was evident that one girl led the
field. Elizabeth had a world of class,
and was the only daughter of a mil
lionaire pretzel king.
At last the time came for a choice
to be made.
Chapter II
The very wealthy, healthy young
duffer had the stage all set for the
biggest brawl of all. His house had
been prepared in every respect to
look its very best, except for one
thing.
Right near the door a broom had
been left lying on the floor!
