HARD LINES—By Ogden Nash. Il
lustrated by Soglo. New York.
Simon & Schuster. 1930. (At the
Stanford Bookstore.)
Ogden Nash began hin career as
a humorous poet by contributing 1o
the New Yorker, and this, his first
volume, is composed largely of verse
that has appeared in that magazine.
The author admits that ho is in
debted to Mrs. Parker, Mr. Hoffen
stein, Mr. Roget, and the Sweet
Singer of Michigan. His verse is

112 good, but it lacks some of Ihc pol
ished perfection of wil 1o he found
in the works of the old master, Hof
fenstein.
Nash treats and mistreats a va
riety of subjects and one remem
bers, in particular, the titles: "Birth
! Comes to the Archbishop" and '"Are
Sects Necessary?" There is also an
elegant poem which tells of the
noble purification of literature at
tempted by Mr. Smoot of Ut.. The
two-line epigrams are recommended.
—E. E. W.
