The University of Nebraska pro
-1 poses* that the price of football
I tickets be determined according to
! the desirability of their location.
This method would be very
similar to the theatre plan where
those who play "tit-tat-toe" on
the felling pay less than those
who sit where they can hear
"stage-whispers" that are meant
for whispers.
Under this plan, 50-yard seats at
the Big Game would sell (legiti
mately) for $100 and the student's
i $1.50 pasteboard would be outside
( the stadium but possibly within
earshot of the noise.
The woman editor of the Mills
! weekly claims, contrary to majority
1 opinion, that college women are

ladies.
Even murder is justified in
SELF-DEFENSE.
The University of Minnesota has
1 been swept by a controversy as to
how much clothes the ballet (called
chorus by the less-refined) should
wear in the annual campus show.
The extent of the audience
varies inversely to the extent of
the chorine's costume.
