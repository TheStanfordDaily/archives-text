LET US HAVE PEACE
As others have said before, this
southern division of the Pacific
Coast Conference basketball league
is quite an organization. As matters ,
now stand, any team may move
J'rori top to bottom in the standings j
on die basis of one week-end's work.
Take California, for example. The ;
Trojans did on two successive oc- i
casions, with amazing results.
So far. the most one-sided
contest featured the Bruins i
downing the Trojans by a store
of 26-15. Aside from this lop
sided (?) game, the majority of
the clashes have gone at from
one to three points difference,
and have been won or lost in
the closing moments of play.
And so, the wise sports writer
lets his readers pick the winner 1
of the loop for himself.
Tonight, for a change, the 51 an- .
furdites should see a fairly unequal ;
contest. Although the reserves will '
start, they appear too strong for the ;
Ccli' ge of Pacific Tigers. With Bear, \
Bruin, and Trojan hides already j
lacked up on the wall, Bunn should 1
li'j able to start a taxidermist shop
pretty soon.
The Indians still have the Broncos
to deal with, and if everything j
come:; to the Cardinal's liking, may
hap the Huskies will also be an op
ponent of the local five. However, at ;
this writing that horsehide seems to
Ije firmly attached to the frames of j
th'> Santa Clarans, and Ihe Huskies I
too remote to be considered.
After the Stanford reserves held *
ihe far-famed Olympic Club team
even last week, we have come to
the conclusion that Bunn has very
capable substitutes, and so things
look pretty dark for the invaders.
We hope that all of the men on the
squad will have a chance to play, j
for there is one chap in practice |
who sinks 'em from all angles. What
will he do in a game?
That TJ.C.L.A. game still
sticks in the minds of those who
saw it. Aside from the miracu
lous shooting of Fawcett, this
lad Lubin did pretty well him
sclf. He looped one in from the
center of the court, and they
seldom throw them from any
farther out than that. And the
prize quip of the game was
hurled by a member of the year
ling squad at Lubin—who was
asked "Who cut your hair?" i
The impartial press lost much of
its sang-froid Saturday. Approxi
mately !ro'; of the pressmen watched
the last 15 minutes of that game on 1
their feet, and with the exception (
of the three U.C.L.A. supporters; !
• i "ted the final gun with hoarse !
cheers. It seemed as though the gun j
went off as soon as Stanford was j
ahead, and not too soon at that.
After two hectic week-ends,
with the Olympic Club over
time encounter thrown in for
good measure, we hope and pray ;
for a fairly quiet game tonight— >
at least one that is not decided
with three seconds to play. Just
about two more games like the
Bruin affair, and the Rest Home
will have another customer.
