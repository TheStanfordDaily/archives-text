# WEATHER HALTS FLIGHT OF DO-X
## Commander May Omit Stop At Cape Verdes 
### 
MADRID, Feb. 2 (TP).â€”The giant ;
German seaplane DO-X lay an- j
chored in Gandobay, near Las Pal- )
mas, Canary Islands, tonight, pre- j
paring to hop off for the Cape Verde j
Islands early Tuesday morning
should weather and ocean conditions j
be favorable.
Messages received from Las Pal- j
mas indicated, however, that a chop- !
py sea might cause difficulties in the
take-off with a heavy load of gaso- j
line, oil and crew.
For the flight to the Cape Verde j
Islands, the second leg of a projected j
journey to Rio de Janeiro, the big !
flying-boat was taking on an addi- j
tional 1,500 gallons of gasoline, sup- !
plementing the supply taken aboard j
at Las Palmas last night.
One report, to the newspaper La |
Nacion, declared that the commander j
was contemplating a direct hop to j
the island of Fernando do Noronha, 1
off the Brazilian coast, omitting the 1
halt at the Cape Verde Islands. This |
report was not confirmed, however. !
