# Stanford Babes Favored To Beat Tiger Frosh
## OLD INJURIES PUT FROSH CAGER OUT OF TIGER CONFLICT Maentz To Be Paired With Massey At Forward Posts Tonight 
### Lowell Cox 
Again without the services of
Topping, star forward, the freshman
hoopsters will meet the College of
Pacific yearling quintet in the
Pavilion at 6:30 tonight in a pre
liminary to the varsity-Pacific clash.
After playing a brilliant game
against Fresno Saturday night, Top
ping is in the hospital being treated
for slight concussions sustained in
the California contest at Oakland
two weeks ago. While his injuries
are not regarded as serious, he will
be confined to the hospital for a
week.
Maentz to Start
This is the second time Topping
lias been lost to the team because
of the California melee, a broken
thumb having kept him on the
bench during the Galileo game last
Tuesday.
Maentz will be paired with Massey
at the forward posts tonight, with
the remainder of the starting lineup,
as usual: Packard, center, and
Wright and Jenkins, guards.
Although inclined to employ grid
iron tactics at times, Maentz played
a good game against Galileo, and
showed up well during part of the
Fresno contest. Panero is also likely
to see service tonight.
Bunn Pleased
Coach John Bunn yesterday ex
pressed himself as highly pleased
with the performance of the babes
against the Fresno squad, which
they stopped easily, 24 to 14. The
first team played only half the
game, with second-string combina
tions making good showings when
injected into the contest.
The yearlings seem to be finding
themselves again, after a complete
slump in the contests with Menlo
and Palo Alto. The return of Jen
kins at guard has added needed
height to the squad, although the
loss of Smith is felt keenly, and the
rest of the team is settling down io
the pace they set in early season.
The Tiger kittens have a strong
outfit that is expected to push the
babes to the, limit, however, and a
fast game is expected.
