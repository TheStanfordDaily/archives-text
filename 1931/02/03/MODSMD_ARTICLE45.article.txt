# A 						SECOND MATTY
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The unexpected pitching hero of
! the last 'world scries was "Big
Moose" Earnshaw, Connie Mack's
! splendid righthander, who had not
i made a very good season's record in
j 1930, yet proved to be a better
, pitcher in the games with the Cards
j than the more famous "Lefty'' Grove
| was.
j Whereas Grove had won twenty
| eight games and lost only five,
j Earnshaw had won but twenty-two
I and lost thirteen, yet when the
"Autumn Classic" of 1930 was a
matter of history, George Earnshaw
was the toast of the baseball world,
and "Lefty" just another good
! pitcher.
Earnshaw Betters Grove
True, Grove and Earnshaw each
I got credit for winning two games,
! but Lefty also lost one, and Big
George pitched 24 innings to the
j southpaw's 19, struck out 19 batters
; as against Grove's 10, allowed only
1 13 hits and 2 runs (Lefty allowed 15
and 5) and didn't lose any games
i at all.
To refresh your memory, Earn
i shaw won the second game 6 to 1,

I and the sixth 7 to 1, and was re- j
! lieved in the eighth inning of the
i fifth game, with Grove getting credit
for the win when Foxx's home run
scored Cochrane in the 9th inning, j
Earnshaw allowed not a score from j
the second inning of the second ;
game until the ninth inning of the '
last contest, a total of 22 consecu
tive scoreless innings.
lit!th Was Great Pitcher
Of course the great Christy
Mathewson pitched 27 consecutive j
scoreless world series innings in
1905, and Babe Ruth held the Red j
Sox's opponents scoreless for 29 j
consecutive frames (in two series, J
1916 and 1918) but the work of Earn- ,
| shaw was superb, and entitles him I
i to a niche in baseball's hall of fame
: alongside the other immortals. >
George was born of socially
! prominent people, a graduate of
i Swarthmore Coilege in Pensylvania,
.a former football player, and is a
member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
Connie Mack paid a lot to get him ;
from Baltimore, and won't ever re- "
gret it. He is just thirty-one years |
j old.

j "Big Moose" Earnshaw, 1930 World Series Mound Hero,
Stole Show From Grove With 19 Strikeouts i
The unexpected pitching hero of
! the last 'world scries was "Big
Moose" Earnshaw, Connie Mack's
! splendid righthander, who had not
i made a very good season's record in
j 1930, yet proved to be a better
, pitcher in the games with the Cards
j than the more famous "Lefty'' Grove
| was.
j Whereas Grove had won twenty
| eight games and lost only five,
j Earnshaw had won but twenty-two
I and lost thirteen, yet when the
"Autumn Classic" of 1930 was a
matter of history, George Earnshaw
was the toast of the baseball world,
and "Lefty" just another good
! pitcher.
Earnshaw Betters Grove
True, Grove and Earnshaw each
I got credit for winning two games,
! but Lefty also lost one, and Big
George pitched 24 innings to the
j southpaw's 19, struck out 19 batters
; as against Grove's 10, allowed only
1 13 hits and 2 runs (Lefty allowed 15
and 5) and didn't lose any games
i at all.
To refresh your memory, Earn
i shaw won the second game 6 to 1,

I and the sixth 7 to 1, and was re- j
! lieved in the eighth inning of the
i fifth game, with Grove getting credit
for the win when Foxx's home run
scored Cochrane in the 9th inning, j
Earnshaw allowed not a score from j
the second inning of the second ;
game until the ninth inning of the '
last contest, a total of 22 consecu
tive scoreless innings.
lit!th Was Great Pitcher
Of course the great Christy
Mathewson pitched 27 consecutive j
scoreless world series innings in
1905, and Babe Ruth held the Red j
Sox's opponents scoreless for 29 j
consecutive frames (in two series, J
1916 and 1918) but the work of Earn- ,
| shaw was superb, and entitles him I
i to a niche in baseball's hall of fame
: alongside the other immortals. >
George was born of socially
! prominent people, a graduate of
i Swarthmore Coilege in Pensylvania,
.a former football player, and is a
member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
Connie Mack paid a lot to get him ;
from Baltimore, and won't ever re- "
gret it. He is just thirty-one years |
j old.
