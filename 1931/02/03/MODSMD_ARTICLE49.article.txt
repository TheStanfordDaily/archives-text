According to latest reports from |
the tennis front, play so far this '
quarter in the varsity and freshman
ladder tournament has resulted in
| several casualties which have
i changed the ranking lists to a con
| siderable extent.
I Varsity men are ranged from
| number one to number ten as f'ol
j lows: Keith Gledhill, Ted Easlon,
i Harry Plymire, Joe Coughlin, Phil
Niederauer, Trow Stephens, Chuck
Weesner, Bob Forbes, Wilbur Cox,
I and Kelsey Pctterson.
The second ten are Russ Robin
son, John Gordon, Hubert Butler,
Howard Blethen, John Gantner,
George Bergstrom, Burton Forney,
Bill Went worth, Ray Edwards, and
i Harry Eichelberger.
' Chuck Otis leads the freshmen,
I followed in order by Monte Shway
! der, Dan Ellis, Jim Sheahan, A 1
Bogan, Norman Wright, Kelley
Thorpe, Alden Sadler, Joe Melczer,
j George Torrence, Frank Barnes,
i John Lohman, Bob Quinn, Fred
' Hills, Herbert Johnson, Paul Fries,
i A 1 Woodward, Richard Hodge, and
I Kendall El ling wood.
j This list is still subject to very
radical shifting, and there is no
doubt but that it will look entirely
different below the first five men or
so in both groups within a few
weeks, according to Coach Elwyn
Bugge.
