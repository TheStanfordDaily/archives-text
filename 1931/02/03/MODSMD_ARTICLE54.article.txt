# Stanford Nine May Lose Cook For Game
## Leave of Absence Ruling May Bar Star First Sacker; Kenealy Seals Play Here Tomorrow 
### FRANCIS LLOYD 
DAIN and B.A.C. rulings have brought a good portion of misery to the
Stanford baseball team during the last few days. The old joker
Pluvius prevented the Indian nine from coming to grips with the Olympic
Club outfit in their first scheduled game, and the far-from-joking rules
of eligibility which the B.A.C. has filed away, to be brought out at em
barrassing moments, have cast their shadow over Kalph Cook, Walter's
star first baseman. Whether or not Cook will be able fo cover the initial
sack in the game tomorrow with the Kenealy Seals, will depend on a
decision passed down by Registrar Mitchell concerning a leave of absence

which Cook is supposed to have
taken out last quarter. In the event
that Cook does not play Glen Tucker
will cavort about Ihe premier base.
The Kenealy Seals, who will face
I the Indian nine at 3:15 o'clock to
morrow in the new local ball park,
have been in the habit of causing
plenty of trouble for Stanford's dia
mond artists. In the encounter last
year the Seals trotted homo with
the bacon to the tune of ( J-7.
Many Big League stars, whose
reputations have been made in the
past and are being made today,
make up the roster of the Seals;
Cronin and Johnson are but two of
those who need no introduction to
j the followers of professional base
ball. The fans are bound to see some
fine exhibitions of the noble, if
I somewhat misunderstood, art of
playing baseball with such men as
Cronin on the field.
The extra days of practice have
visibly smoothed out some rough
spots in the working of the Stanford
infield combination. The guardians
of the distant pastures, led by Cap
; tain Johnny Hunkon, show excep
! tional ability for this early in the
| season and should prove able men
I on the defense in tomorrow's game.
