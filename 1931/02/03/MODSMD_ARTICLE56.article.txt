# RUSSIAN INTEREST CONCENTRATED ON INDUSTRIALIZATION
## Abandon World Commune Plan; Seek To Better Trade Relations 
### 
MOSCOW, Feb. 2 (/P).—Turning
her back temporarily upon the rest
of the world, Soviet Russia is de
voting every ounce of energy to the
five-year plan for industrialization.
For the moment the project of ed
ucating the rest of the world to
Communism has been virtually
abandoned and during the period of
truce the Soviet Union is willing to
make the best of capitalism in so
far as the capitalistic system can be
of material benefit to her.
Significant of the revised attitude
on propaganda abroad is the clos
ing of the Sun Yat Sen University
which frankly was a school for the
training of Communist missionaries
to China. Stalin University, whose
purpose was the education of all for
eign students in the tenets of Marx
and Lenin also has been closed, and
it is not believed that the Communist
party is spending much money on
propaganda abroad.
Such propaganda as is conducted
is in the interests of improving trade
relations and combating charges of
forced labor and in establishing
credits necessary to the success of
the five-year plan.
There are indications that if the
"world revolution" should come to
morrow or even next year, the Rus
sian Communists would be the most
embarrassed people in the world. For
it would mean disruption of the in
dustrialization program which is up
permost in the minds of all the lead
ers.
War is the Soviet Union's greatest
fear now, for it would mean the un
doing of the tremendous work of
reconstruction which the leaders are
now proceeding on schedule.
