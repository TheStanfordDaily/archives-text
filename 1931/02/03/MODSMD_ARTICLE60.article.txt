# PLANS FOR ANNUAL DANCE DRAMA SOON TO BE COMPLETED
## 
### 
Plans for the annual Dance Drama
to be staged by the women ol' the
advanced dancing classes on March
10, are now being completed. Kathe
line Musante has been elected man
ager by the group, which is working
under the direction of Mrs. Gretchen
K. Butts.
Eleanor Furst was appointed by
Mrs. Botts to take charge of the
costuming, Frances Sanford of the
music, Margaret Friedman of pub
licity, Aline Lissner of staging and
lighting, and Jean Bunnel of pro
grams and tickets. The personnel of
the various committees has not been
announced.
It is not yet decided whether the
Drama will be held in the Assembly
Hall, as it has of necessity been in
the past, or whether it will be made
the occasion of officially opening
the new women's gymnasium, since
an adequate place for it exists there.
The Women's Athletic Association
is inagurating a new system this
quarter by giving regular W.A.A.
points to participants in this pageant,
although the exact scale of these
points, which will be awarded on a
merit basis, has not been settled
upon.
