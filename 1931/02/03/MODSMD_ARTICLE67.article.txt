# GROUNDHOG APPEARS Sight Of Shadow Scares SIX WEEKS' RAIN SEEN
## 
### 
Six weeks or more of winter
weather is foreseen by H. Tobias
Groundhog, who emerged yesterday
from his burrow in the highlands of
Frenchman's Hill and observed his
shadow sharply marked out by the
noonday sun.
Meanwhile his relatives of the
Marmota Monax family—to give it
the official name—waddled forth
from vantage burrows all over the
United States, and according to the
old Monaxian custom, looked about
for their shadows.
Skies were clear in most parts of
the South and Middle West and
along the Atlantic seaboard, so that
the various local groundhogs, wood
chucks, or Marmota Monax—call
them what you will—retreated rap
idly into their holes to sleep through
six more weeks of cold weather.
The Pittsburgh groundhog was in
a quandary. He came out of his hole
to find the sun shining, but so ob
scured by a dense pall of smoke
which hung over the city, that he
couldn't be sure of a legitimate
shadow. A similar situation existed
at St. Louis yesterday.
The patriarch woodchuck of New
York spent only a short time in the
open, according to comparatively re
liable statistics collected from vari
ous parts of the country, but during
that time he paused long enough to
predict more snow.
But how much rain would a wood
chuck predict, if a woodchuck could
predict rain, is the point raised by
the national weather bureau. Ac
cording to Associated Press dis
patches, the bureau contends that
the Monax emergence has no scien
tific significance and declines to
make groundhog readings.
