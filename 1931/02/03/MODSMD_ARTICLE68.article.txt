# FORD TO ABANDON SOUTH AMERICAN PROJECT, REPORT
## Brazil Dubber Plantation "Gamble," Officials Refuse Comment 
### 
DETROIT, Feb. 2 (/P). â€”A "gigantic
gamble," with the stakes so great as
to be difficult of comprehension was
the characterization in many quar
ters when Henry Ford announced in
1927 that he intended to establish a
i huge rubber plantation in the Ama-
I zon valley of Brazil.
Reports that the project in which
j Ford already has invested many mil-
I lions of dollars was about to be
abandoned brought neither denial
nor confirmation, from authorized
spokesmen at the Ford offices here
today.
Although the project had been
J praised in many quarters as an un
j dertaking that would bring to the
! Amazon valley a civilization rival
j ing that of the great Mississippi val-
I ley in North America it also came
iin for criticism. The terms of the
I grant that gave to Ford some 4,000,-
000 acres of land on the Piquatuba
Plateau, State of Para, 750 miles
from the city of Para, were criti
| cized by some Brazilian newspapers.
| Also there was not infrequently
j difficulty with the native laborer,
j The "Caboclos," as these native
I workers were called, were unaccus
! tomed to the efficiency methods in
| troduced by representatives of the
! Ford organization brought from De
troit. Moreover, many of them did
I not take kindly to the orders that
j alcoholic drinks were to be barred.
