Pressurciess -Writing Pen
GUARANTEED FOR LIFE
31% mere Parkers in college too
as nation-wide pen poll shows
The late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
wrote reams of manuscript—tried
all sorts of pens. Came the day, as
it has to 26 million others, when
he discovered the Pressureless-
Writing Parker Duofold, "I have
at last met my affinity in pens," he
said. You, too, can gain great aid
from this Pen that lets you write
without strain, and think without
irritation. Go to the nearest pen
counter and look for the name—
'•Geo. S. Parker DUOFOLD"—
on the barrel. That Guarantees the
genuine for Life.
