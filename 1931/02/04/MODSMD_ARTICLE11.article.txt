# CARD CAGEMEN DEFEAT PACIFIC IN SLOW GAME
## Small Crowd Views Second, Third String Men in Ragged Workout 
### Harry "Stew" Crawford 
Fifteen of Coach John Bunn's
Cardinal basketeers engaged in a
lethargic court workout last night in
the Pavilion against an erratic quin
tet representing the College of the
Pacific, coming out on the long end
of a 44 to 27 count despite the fact,
that it was an "off" night for the
Indian hoopmen.
Except that referees, time-keep
ers, and a handful of spectators
were present, the affair resembled
a regular afternoon skirmish be-
I twoen Bunn's second- and third
string squads.
Indians Never Headed
However, had his cagemen dis
[ played such ragged ball in practice
| as they did last night, it is prob
ble that the Indian coach would
have stopped the play to point out
mistakes almost as ,often as the
officials did to call fouls, jump balls,
and broken dribbles.
Starting the tilt with Reggie
Meade, Payne Palmer, Mike Rey
nolds, Rudy Rintala, and John Han
cock, the Redshirts chalked up four
points before Tigers could score.
Stanford was never headed in the
contest, though the visitors man
aged to tie the count at 12-12 a few
minutes befox-e half time through
the good work of Odale, star for
i ward for the Tigers.
Teamwork Lacking
j Leading 18 to 15 at half time, the
| Cardinals came back to increase
j their advantage steadily until the
j final gun. Neither outfit showed
I any teamwork, the smoothest pass
j ing taking place for the most part
j between members of the opposing
! teams.
i Though the Indians put on white
j jerseys in place of the red ones for
I the second period, the added con
j trast between the colors worn by
| the opposing teams failed to rem
edy the situation. Stanford contin
j ued to oblige by tossing to Tiger
j men, and the visitors did not hesi
| tate to return the compliment.
Reynolds, with 11 points, tied for
| scoring honors with Crandall of Col
; lege of the Pacific, Palmer showed
I some good basketball before he left
I the game early in the second half,
I v/hen Bunn began sending in a
! steady stream of second- and ihird
i stringers from the bench.
