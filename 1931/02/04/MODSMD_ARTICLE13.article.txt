Indicatiolat the world may be |
j entering a»r great ice age will ]
be studied! Commander Donald |
B. Mac Mil iyeteran explorer, in;
his trip to jArctic scheduled for
, this June. •
Plans for : year's scientific ven- j
lure, which® explorer described
I in an inter! yesterday, include
, primarily th»§k of aerial mapping |
of so-far iiplored land to the!
north of Lallor, and mapping the j
j great ice eajfeaffin Land, which j
is the last ainder of the great
, glacier whicovered the northern
half of the rid many thousand
years ago.
Glial Growing
By obtainiab accurate picturc
of the great (ftp, it will be pos- I
sible to makicurate comparisons
in the future discover the rela
tive size of tflncier. If the cap,
has expanded,will probably indi
cate the begirtg of another gla
cial period sir other Arctic gla
( eiers are knoVtc be growing. |

| MacMillan plans to use the air
I for this exploration, and says, "We
j can cover more ground in a week
j with a plane than in 10 years with
: a dog team. There is territory to
! the west of the coast line, extend
j ing 250 miles north of Nain, Labra
i dor, that has not been explored or
I mapped, and with an aerial camera
' we can place this district accurately
I on the world map."
Lockheed to Be Used
| The Commander expects to be
I gone three months, to use three
ships and three planes. For one of
his flying machines he expects to
use a Lockheed-Vega cabin mono
plane, which is to be fitted with a
large mapping camera. The ma
i chine will be able to record six
miles of territory with each plate
exposure from an altitude of 10,000
feet. A short-wave radio set will
enable him to keep in touch with
the Bowdoin, and extra gasoline
tanks will give the plane a cruising
I distance of 2100 miles.
