## Announcement Of Specific Charges Delayed With Navy Department 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (/P). -
Major Henry Leonard, counsel for
Major General Smedley D. Butler
of the Marine Corps, believes it's
better to work in the dark than not
at all.
He and his client plan to get to
gether in Leonard's office tomorrow
morning to talk over defense pro
cedure for Butler's pending court
martial.
Leonard said they were "work
ing in the dark" until specific
charges had been served on Butler
by the Navy Department.
Uncertainty to End
Their period of uncertainty may
end by nightfall, however. Secre
tary Adams said today that "in all
probability the charges would be
available tomorrow."
Major Leonard said John W. Da
vis, 1024 Democratic nominee for
president, was planning to assist in
Butler's defense.
Sessions of the court will be open
to the public unless this right is
waived by Butler or unless the
court, for reasons of propriety, shall
ask and receive approval for them
to be closed from Secretary Adams.
Watts, Prosecutor
Captain William C. Watts, prose
cution* counsel, with Rear Admiral
David F. Sellers, judge advocate
general of the Navy, conferred to
day with Secretary Adams.
When approved by the secretary
the charges will be submitted to
Major General Ben H. Fuller, ma
rine commandant, for transmission
to General Butler.
