# VAGABONDS SET SCORING RECORD
## Defeat Alpha Delts, 44-4, in Mural Contest 
### Michael Crofoot 
Swamping Alpha Delta Phi's bas
ketball team, 44-4, the Vagabonds ;
won their third straight victory, set '
j up a new high scoring record for |
I the intramural season, and practi- j
! tally clinched first place in League
111 last night in the Encina gymna- j
; sium.
On account of the freshman and ;
varsity basketball games in the Pa- j
vilion only one other intramural'
1 contest was scheduled; Sigma Nu |
won it from Beta Theta Pi by de- j
fault.
Games to be played this evening I
i follow: Sequoia I vs. Phi Gamma j
' Delta in the Pavilion at 7 o'clock; !
Encina V vs. Kappa Sigma in the I
gym at 7; El Campo vs. Theta Chi j
in the Pavilion at 8; Alpha Tau |
Omega vs. Delta Chi in the gym !
at 8.
Vagabonds Good
Although the Vagabonds estab- i
i lished themselves as one of the good j
i teams in the intramural tournament |
i by their topheavy win from the Al- i
pha Dolts, they did not win a place j
i alongside Sequoia I and Sigma Chi j
I as one of the outstanding quintets j
jin the tourney. The reason for this j
j is that their strength was the Al- j
pha Delt weakness. However, any j
| intramural team scoring 44 points in I
| one game deserves the adjective, j
:good.
Long passes, well executed fast j
breaks after Alpha Delt hope shots, |
and Rood shooting were the means I
to the Vagabond end, 44 points. The
I fact that their opponents had nei
j ther offense nor defense helped the
j record breaking.
MoClurg On Islanding
Outstanding man for the Vaga-
I bond bucket brigade was McClurg,
j who tossed in seven baskets and
1 one free throw for the evening's
high point honors. Taken out five
J minutes before the end of the game, i
j he found his team had a chance for |
I a new record, went back in, and
! outdid the Minute Men, accounting
' for seven points in three minutes.
Bartlett also turned in a nice
game for the Vagabonds. Savage
! of the Alpha Delts deserves much
"kudos" also for saving his team ;
! from a shut-out.
Intramural fans will have a
chance to see the prospective cham
pions, Sequoia I. in action tonight.
The all-star hallmen are heavily
favored to take their third straight
j contest. A line can be gotten on El i
j Campo, the only obstacle in the
path of Sequoia I to the champion
ship of League IV, when they meet
the Theta Chi's, whom Sequoia
trimmed last week 24-8.
