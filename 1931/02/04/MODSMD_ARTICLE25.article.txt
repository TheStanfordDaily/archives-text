# UNIQUE TRAFFIC FINE SYSTEM TO BE TRIED
## 
### 
EVANSTON. 111., Fob. 3 f,Ti.â€”
Evanston is going to adopl a "cafe
teria" system for minor infractions
of its traffic laws.
Prices for each type of violation
will be fixed in advance and the sen
sitive motorists will have nothing to
do but walk in, pay his fine to a
clerk, and walk out without seeing
the judge.
The "cafeteria" system, announced
by Police Magistrate H. H. Porter,
is designed to speed up disposal of
such cases. Of course, if the accused
motorist wants to plead not guilty,
he may do so and come back later
for trial.
