# PENN ADOPTS STANFORD'S B.A.C.
## 
### 
After endeavoring to reduce a $4,000,000 debt incurred through
athletic expenditures, the Vniversity of Pennsylvania announces the
adoption of a system, of control which appears to be sensational to
the eastern sports writers. In reality, it is very similar to that em
ployed here.
I'nder the new plan, I'enn's athletics are to be subject to the
direct control of the president of the university. The institution's
executive is to appoint a dean of the new department of physical
education, in which will be located the student health services, physi
cal instruction, find the entire range of athletics, both intramural and
intercollegiate. Athletic coaches are to become members .of the
faculty, instead of existing as heretofore as employees of the present
Council on Athletics, an independent corporation.
At Stanford the set-up is alike, with the president of the I'ni
versitx controlling the policy and administration of the Hoard of
\thletic ( oiitrol.
In the majority of eastern institutions, athletic control is usually
in the hands of an independent body. I nder this scheme these or
ganizations contract large debts, and huge gate receipts, which cause
over-emphasis of intercollegiate competition, are sought to fulfill
lhe obligations.
I'enn's move is by no means an experiment. If the plan can suc
cessfully operate at Stanford, it should do equally well at the Quaker
institution.
