"( Ibjectionable" matter printed in Columns, I'niversity of Wasli
ill jLCI<»II comic magazine, has aroused the faculty there. I lie editorial
heads of the magazine will he placed on probation and its contents
censored in the future, if recommendations of the faculty committee
♦
on publications are accepted.
The committee proposes that I'rofcssor Leslie J. Aver, acting
dean of the Washington law school, read all the contents of each
issue in advance of publication. The committee further recommends
that the continuance of Columns depend on its being "a magazine
that is clean and in good taste."
Ralph Shaffer, editor of Columns, charges that the Washington
faculty committee has directed much unnecessary and unfair pub
licity at the magazine, haying previously given no intimation that the
tone of the publication ought to have been changed.
It appears that the Washington faculty members arc making a
big stir over an apparently small matter. They are right in their
stand that vulgarity has no place in any kind of a college publication,
but they are amusing themselves with committee investigations, talk
of censorship, and of editorial probation where a mere expression of
facult\ disapproval would probably have produced the desired effect.
I'acuity censorship of college publications is not necessary and is
almost never justified. A few words of advice often can be of great
aid to student editors, but censorship is seldom-productive of bene
ficial results.
