# RELIGION AND EDUCATION

### 
Voting men and women of college age all too frequently neglect
religion and religions education. A survey of the Stanford Chapel
any Sunday morning reveals row after row of empty seats, and a
predominance of outsiders in the small assembly present.
No life is complete without due attention to religion in one of its
many branches. Stanford students are in an enviable position in
this respect. A beautiful chapel is close at hand. Services are non
sectarian. Leading theologists are brought to the campus as guest
speakers each Sunday. And the University chaplain, Dr. D. Charles
Gardner, is a most able man.
"We come to church to prove our loyalty to the great principles
of life, such as truth, love and goodness," said Dr. Gardner in his
sermon last Sunday. Stanford undergraduates might well demon
strate this loyalty more regularly.
