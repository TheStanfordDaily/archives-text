DON'T FORGET HONOR
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Duniway, in his letter that
appeared Monday, has said, . . . "In
a system of grading that is frankly
competitive, that protection is essen
tial." His statement is true. Let us
have protection.
He has also said, "The Executive
Committee ... is willing to face
the facts." Here are the facts:
Protective Ways
There are two ways in which to
secure protection. One is the proc
tor system, with careful supervision
of examinations and rigid penalties.
Its disadvantages are that it gives
cheating the savory flavor of re
bellion against authority, and that
it makes general the feeling that "If
he can get away with it, he deserves
it."
And there is the honor system,
which uses the most powerful of all
preventatives, fear of contempt and
social opprobium. The person who is
despised by his fellows is punished
far more terribly and effectively
than the one who is assigned 50
hours of work at the Convalescent
Home. And the enforcement of an
honor system is far more certain
and just.
Cannot Combine?
But—These two systems cannot
be combined.
When authority (it is immaterial
whether that authority be vested in
Men's Council or in the faculty) and
formal penalties are thrust upon an
honor system, the honor system
both loses its only power and ceases
to deserve its name. The feeling im
mediately arises, "If he is willing to
take the chance of punishment, it is
none of our business." Cheating
ceases to be dishonorable, in the
sense that it ceases to be despised.
We now have such a compromise
between the two systems, and we
are feeling its effects.
Has the Executive Committee
faced these facts?

THEY'RE ONLY HUMAN
The Editor, Sir:
I should like to reply to the letter
in today's Campus Opinion by the

writer on sports for the."300.
The first point that women would
take more interest if there were |
intercollegiate competition is, I
think, irrefutable. At any rate it is j
; quite evident that the interest in !
| women's athletics is remarkably low
I here. Furthermore, the women need
the stimulus of foreign competition
! just as much as men. They are hu
man—the ancients notwithstanding— i
and like to receive credit for their
results.
As for the women doing them- ,
; selves bodily injury the point that '
! commonsense is the proper control
i was well put. If the women can't
j take care of themselves, I ask, who i
can? It is certain that no one can 1
i be blind to the effect of any sort of I
i prohibition.
I should like to bring up one more j
point. Women will have their com
petition and if they can't get it in
i the college they turn to the clubs as
! Mrs. Moody did. I think that does
infinite harm to the morale of the i
women students. The leaders in !
j women's athletics should be college j
I women, not club women,
j —J. P. S., Jr.
! ENFORCEMENT IS THE END
The Editor, Sir:
; Granted, Mr. Duniway, that we
have no honor at all unless we re- j
sist temptation, I still believe that j
j Mr. Jameson sought to reconcile I
| "honor" and "absence of incentive!
to do something other than what is !
honorable." With him, I think, {
honor was not the end.
The question, you will perceive, j
1 may be looked at somewhat differ- j
1 ently. We may do away with the |
i "Grade-Point" system and thus—in
; part—with problems calling for j
honor, or we may abandon the ex- j
I isting compromise between an honor
! code and a proctor system.
Compulsion by authority fore-
I dooms honor—as a code or as an j
entity. And this, Mr. Duniway, is j
the reason I dislike the attempts of !
I the Executive Committee to foist j
honor upon us. Honor cannot be I
i foisted.
