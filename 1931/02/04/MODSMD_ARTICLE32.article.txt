PORGY —At the Geary Theatre, San ,
Francisco.
Porgy, a powerful negro play by j
i Dorothy and Dußose Heyward, has i
; opened for a limited run at the
i Geary Theatre. It is a melodramatic
i story of negro life on the waterfront !
' of Charleston, excellently acted, ad
! mirably directed and highly excit-
I ing. I
The play itself has no weak
points. The Heywards have set forth
; a gripping talc, filled with tragedy,
superstition, and vice, but yet up
: lifted by negro melody and rhythm,
land throughout which runs a reck
; less joy of living.
The cast with minor exceptions is ]
1 entirely negro. It is extremely large j
I and yet each individual gives a fin
ished performance. Evelyn Preer as ,
Bess, and Clarence Muse as Porgy, j
! the cripple, play the leads and as j
j such are outstanding. However, the i
I other actors, though playing lesser !
; roles, do usually good work. j
j. Perhaps the outstanding feature j
1 of the play is the singing. Negro
voices are renowned for their
beauty, and the singing in Porgy is j
no exception. The wake held over j
the murdered Robbins is terrifically
i effective. Songs as part of the negro
life play an equally important part
: in the play.
To Alan Mowbray, the director, !
' goes much credit. There is scarcely !
i a flaw in the handling of any of the I

I scenes and many of them are im- i
i mensely powerful. The sets also add j
| much to the entire effect. In fact j
Porgy is that rare combination of a !
superior play, unusually good di- !
rection and staging, and a finished j
cast. —N. J.
UP POPS THE DEVIL—At the Cur
ran Theatre.
"Up Pops the Devil" conclusively j
proved its right to the epithet, !
"laugh riot of New York," on its |
opening night. It is a clever play of |
the marital life of Anne and 'Steve •
Merrick.
Steve is a writer without time
-enough to write. Anne persuades
him to take her place in the home
and write his novel. Burlesque I
shows clearly and comfortably that, j
in spite of modern trends toward
equal rights, man's place is not yet j
in the home during the day.
John Arledge as Biney and Esther j
Howard as his "girl friend" steal
the first act and save an otherwise j
dragging situation. With the rise of I
the curtain on the second act, Ray
mond Hackett comes to life and
plays a convincing Steve, admirably
paired with Ann Teaman. From
then on the excellent cast and clever
direction speed the play along to
its climax.
"Up Pops the Devil" makes a very j
good evening's entertainment for all
those who have a broad mind, 1930 i
model. —J. N.
