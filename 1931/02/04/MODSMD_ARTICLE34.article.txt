The Stanford rough may be dead
but his ideals are living after him.
U.S.C. men have decided 10 ban
corsages from campus formals.
Corsages are disapproved not
because Trojan men love Tro- I
jan women less but because the
slock market is down more.
The rough likes posies but he !
likes to see them bloom in some
body's backyard.
Oberlin College has just completed j
a survey which reveals that Ihere '
are as marly persons incarcerated in
insane asylums as students in Amer
ican colleges. Everybody can feel j
relieved. America is saved!
It is claimed that Oxford un
dergraduates owe $1,250,000 to
storekeepers. Both the villages
of Oxford and Palo Alto realize
that education PAYS.
Students at the University of |
Mexico have the right to strike, take
part in the administration, and oust
professors when they desire. Yes, !
but so is everybody a general in j
the Mexican army.
The UniversiLy of Colorado is to
have an unusual stag dance. The
unusual feature being that women j
will act as "stags" (or more proper- I
ly "stagesses"). The co-eds will do j
the cutting in and perform other !
features of the genuine stag.
If the men are to play their
part properly, they should keep
their "escorts" waiting half an
hour, keep up a running talk on
former swell dates, smoke cigar
ette after cigarette with forced
nonchalance, and perform other
typically feminine acts.
The University of Nebraska is to I
give a course in yell leading which
will include instruction in voice j
training and handling crowds.
The course should include how
to stop booing of basketball
referees and how to direct con
vincing smiles to scattered rep
resentatives from ten different
sororities at the same time.
