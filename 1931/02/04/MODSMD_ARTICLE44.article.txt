## FALL IN LINE 
### 
The other day, having little to do,
we went down and visited the new
ball park. Large enough to permit
home runs inside the park, with
spacious bleachers, that new home
of the Stanford nine is certainly the
sweetest collegiate ball park one
could wish for. In fact, it will com
pare favorably with a great many
big league homes.
Looking back over ancient his
tory, some interesting facts are
revealed. Stanford has not won
a baseball series from California
since 1025, when Ernest Nevers
and company came back after
losing the first game by a score
of 27-5 to win the final two en
counters.
Since the glorious season of 1925,
the Stanford Indians have won ex
actly two games from the California
Bears. A victory in 1926 and another
victory in 1927 sum up the few
bright spots in the baseball rivalry.
Since 1927, Stanford has not won
a ball game from California. In live
years, Stanford has triumphed in
two, California in thirteen clashes.
In fact, ten straight Indians'
scalps have gone with the Blue
and Gold nines in the past, and
the end is not yet in sight. While
i( is early to predict how a team
will look before it plays any
games, the mere fact that Norm
Ilorner will chuck for California
makes the diamond sport appear
very gloomy to Farm dweliers.
The season of 1930-31 should be a
big red affair. With a high-score
record in football, the first basket
ball triumph since the dork ages,
and better things to come, Cardinal
athletics seem to be moving in time
with a victory march. Where there
are victories, there must be ma
terial.
In keeping with the siring of
Berkeley conquests on the dia
mond is a low mutter within
(he student body whenever the
sport is mentioned. Whether tiie
tumble precedes an earthquake,
or whether the matter is merely
the result of passing friction re
mains to be seen. On the face of
the situation, it would seem that
the present season will decide
the case.
This column does not hold with
the view that the chief aim of ath
letics is to win; neither do we hold
that a team should continue to lose
with monotonous regularity. Judg
ing by the results in other fields, a
change of scenery sometimes has
been known to work wonders; even
the mention of such a possibility
may not be without stimulation.
And so there the matter is. If
a team cannot win in intercolle
giate competition, it can gain
just as much exercise and prac
tice playing intramural or in
terclass. Intercollegiate matches
lose much of their charm if the
results are a foregone conclu
sion. There is no thrill in kick
ing a Bear or an Indian when he
is down. —L. K., Jr.

The other day, having little to do,
we went down and visited the new
ball park. Large enough to permit
home runs inside the park, with
spacious bleachers, that new home
of the Stanford nine is certainly the
sweetest collegiate ball park one
could wish for. In fact, it will com
pare favorably with a great many
big league homes.
Looking back over ancient his
tory, some interesting facts are
revealed. Stanford has not won
a baseball series from California
since 1025, when Ernest Nevers
and company came back after
losing the first game by a score
of 27-5 to win the final two en
counters.
Since the glorious season of 1925,
the Stanford Indians have won ex
actly two games from the California
Bears. A victory in 1926 and another
victory in 1927 sum up the few
bright spots in the baseball rivalry.
Since 1927, Stanford has not won
a ball game from California. In live
years, Stanford has triumphed in
two, California in thirteen clashes.
In fact, ten straight Indians'
scalps have gone with the Blue
and Gold nines in the past, and
the end is not yet in sight. While
i( is early to predict how a team
will look before it plays any
games, the mere fact that Norm
Ilorner will chuck for California
makes the diamond sport appear
very gloomy to Farm dweliers.
The season of 1930-31 should be a
big red affair. With a high-score
record in football, the first basket
ball triumph since the dork ages,
and better things to come, Cardinal
athletics seem to be moving in time
with a victory march. Where there
are victories, there must be ma
terial.
In keeping with the siring of
Berkeley conquests on the dia
mond is a low mutter within
(he student body whenever the
sport is mentioned. Whether tiie
tumble precedes an earthquake,
or whether the matter is merely
the result of passing friction re
mains to be seen. On the face of
the situation, it would seem that
the present season will decide
the case.
This column does not hold with
the view that the chief aim of ath
letics is to win; neither do we hold
that a team should continue to lose
with monotonous regularity. Judg
ing by the results in other fields, a
change of scenery sometimes has
been known to work wonders; even
the mention of such a possibility
may not be without stimulation.
And so there the matter is. If
a team cannot win in intercolle
giate competition, it can gain
just as much exercise and prac
tice playing intramural or in
terclass. Intercollegiate matches
lose much of their charm if the
results are a foregone conclu
sion. There is no thrill in kick
ing a Bear or an Indian when he
is down. —L. K., Jr.
