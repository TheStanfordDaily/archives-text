By Lowell Cox
After getting away to a slow start,
the Cardinal freshman quintet set
tled down to a relentless pace early
in their preliminary with the College
ol' the Pacific yearlings last night to
crush the Tiger kittens, 41 to 24.
The first minutes of the contest
found the Stanford babes on the
short end of a 4-0 count. Stanford
seemed about to take the lead as
successive baskets by Packard and
Maentz knotted the score, but Pacific
matched tit for tat until the count
was knotted at 8-all.
Indians Take Lead
Here two free throws by Packard
put Stanford into a lead which they
never relinquished. As Packard and
Massey adjusted their guns the score
rapidly amounted to 27-16 at half
time.
The slaughter continued in the
second period, with Coach John
Bunn sending in a continual stream
of second- and third-string players.
Had the first team been used
throughout the game the score could
easily have been increased another
dozen points.
The fray was featured by a tight
Stanford defense which allowed the
invaders few shots in the hole, and
a smoothly working attack which
could not be stopped.
Second Pacific Defeat
The game marked the Kittens'
only loss since their opening contest,
when they dropped a close decision
lo Oakdale.
Free throws contributed much to
the Stanford total, particularly in
ihe first half, when the frosh sank
all but three of 10 tries, Maentz
being guilty of the three misses.
Packard accounted for four, Wright
for two, and Massey for one in this
period. On the other hand, Pacific
made but two of nine attempts.
Packard again won high-point
honors, tallying 13 points in the
time he was in the game. Massey,
who usually has difficulty in finding
the basket, tied with Maentz for
second with eight points.
Jenkins, besides playing his best
game of the season at guard, tanked
three field goals for six points.
