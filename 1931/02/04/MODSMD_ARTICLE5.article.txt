Life in the far North was real-
I istieally depicted to a large audience
[ last night by the fascinating stories
of Commander Donald B. MacMil
lan, veteran Arctic explorer, illus
! trated by his spectacular collectior
,of colored slides and motion picture
I reels.
His lecture and pictures coverec
his six years' exploration tour o!
| northern Labrador, Greenland, anc
the Arctic regions, during which he
i associated intimately with the na
j tive Eskimos, photographing them in
I their daiiy live?. lie also obtainec
i many unique pictures of the wile
I flowers that bloom in the summei
' season, and rare views of birds anc
I animals.
To Make 14th Trip
"Arctic work gets a grip on i
| man," said the speaker. "I have beer
! in this field for 23 years, and I am
| planning to make my 14th trip to
I these regions in June.
! "In spite of the tragic results of
j so many of the excursions, which
have delayed the actual discovery of
j the North Pole and the complete ex-
I ploration of the uncharted northern
I seas for over 300 years, I have never
! lost a man throughout the 23 years
s of my experience.
Has Veteran Aides
"I have always had an excellent
j staff of assistants," he continued,
j "Ralph Robinson, my first mate, has
j been with me ten years. My engi
neer, John Jaynes, has assisted me
! for nine years, and Frank Hender
son, second mate, has been with me
for six years. These men, with their
dependability and experience, have
I been invaluable to me. The rest of
my stafl is ordinarily made up of
college instructors and students* spc-
I cializing in botanical and geographi
cal fields, or men who are interested
! in exploration and preparing books
' on our experiences."
Commander MacMillan showed
: pictures of the most northern tribe
of Indians, driven north at some time
in the past by warring enemies. The
Indians, who came near his home in
i Labrador, were at first wild and re
sented the intrusion of the white
] men, but finally became friendly
; after being treated kindly by the
commander and his party.
The explorer has become very
popular with the Eskimos, whom he
I has been studying. lie established a
' school for the children, in the little
Eskimo village near his Labrador
home, and he frequently entertains
the people with moving pictures, the
radio and phonograph, and occa
| sional rides in his snow automobile,
a Fort fitted with runners in front,
which is used for transportation
when the snow is packed.
