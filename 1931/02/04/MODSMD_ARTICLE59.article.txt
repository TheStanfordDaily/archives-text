# STANFORD NINE TO CLASH WITH KENEALY SEALS
## Dan Johnson, Speed Hardy Start As Battery In Today's Opener 
### 
If old man weather is kind, the
I Stanford varsity nine will begin its
j season today against the Kenealy
| Seals at 3:15 o'clock in the new local
I diamond when Dan Johnson, the
I Indians' star hurler, begins firing
| the little white pellets across the
■ plate at Spud Hardy, ,Wolter's veter-
I an catcher.
I The Seals have been in the habit
| of causing a lot of trouble on their
j visits to the Farm, having come off
] on the long end of a 9-7 count in
I last year's encounter. The chances
!of the Indians were greatly en
| hanced by an announcement from
Bill Owens, Stanford's faculty rep
resentative for the Pacific Coast
Conference, that Ralph Cook, bii 1—
! liant first sacker, would be eligible
| for competition.
j Heavy hitting on the part of the
I Seals may be expected with such
I men as Hoy Johnson and Joe Cronin,
prominent players in the Major
Leagues, in the lineup. To offset
this weighty artillery, Stanford will
jbe able to put on the field the
j strongest array of pitchers who have
! toed the local mound in several
\ years. Besides Dan Johnson, the
j starting pitcher, Harry Wolter has
, Vard Loomis, Eadie, Caddeil, Mil
j sap, and Harry Plymire.
The complete starting line-ups are
I as follows: For Stanford, Dan John-
I son, p; Hardy, c; Cook, lb; Philippi,
j 2b; Dykes Johnson, 3b; Delmas, ss;
| Hunken, If; Bowles, cf; Campbell,
rf.
For Kenealy Seals, Bahr, p; Cox,
c; Hutchinson, lb; Maloney, 2b;
Montague, 3b; Cronin, ss; Donovan,
If; Johnson, cf; Ward, rf; O'Keefe,
