# UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA COPIES STANFORD SPORT SYSTEM: STOREY

### Ralph Malloch 
Yesterday's widely heralded an
nouncement by the University of
Pennsylvania that henceforth the
athletic structure of that university
will be reorganized on a basis of
simplicity and "underemphasis" on
sports, is not as revolutionary as it
would seem, according to Thomas A.
Storey, head of the Board of Athlet
ic Control. Stanford, according to
Storey, has been running athletics
for some time under virtually the
same system as announced by the
University of Pennsylvania.
A committee from Pennsylvania
traveled about the country last year
and inspected the athletic systems
of various universities. Stanford's
methods of conducting athletics

| were investigated, and their result
| ant adoption by the Eastern institu
; tion is highly gratifying to the local
I authorities.
Control and management of ath
letics at Pennsylvania have been
taken over by the president of the
university, and the sports them
selves have been given back to the
students. The present all-powerful
! council on athletics, composed of
alumni, students, and faculty, will
I be abolished.
! Spring and pre-season training in
football, training camps, training
tables, dormitories for athletes, have
been wiped out. In all sports coaches
have been made members of the fac
ulty and will receive the salaries of
! faculty members.
