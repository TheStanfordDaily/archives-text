# BRIDGE ACROSS SAN FRANCISCO BAY APPROVED
## War Department Reports No Objection to Kahn Bridge Measure NAVY ALSO FAVORABLE 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (/P). â€”The
world's biggest bridge project had
the approval today of the War De
partment.
That branch of the government
reported to the House Commerce
Committee it could see no objection
from either a navigation or military
standpoint to the Kahn bill which
would allow California to build a
bridge between San Francisco and
Oakland. The $75,000,000 project to
be financed by a bond issue and
completed in about five years, would
not interfere with navigation, the
War Department said.
To Touch Goat Island
The report added that stipulations
in the bill referring to the portion
of the bridge that would touch Goat
Island government reservations had
eliminated possible objections from
a military standpoint.
The Kahn Bill provides that be
fore the structure can be built the
state must obtain permission from
the secretaries of war, navy and
commerce to cross Goat Island. It
would require the state to replace
any government buildings or im
provements damaged by construc
tion of the bridge on sites acceptable
to the Federal Government depart
ment heads.
No Objection
Because of the stipulations', the
War Department reported, there is
"no military objection to passage of
the bill in its present form."
When the bridge first was pro
posed, both the War and Navy De
partments objected. The Navy, how
ever, has withdrawn its objections
and approved the present measure.
