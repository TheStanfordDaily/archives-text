according to Professor Raymond

"There are now three centers of
world affairs—Europe, Japan, and
the United States," Professor Get
tell said. "The United States is the
only nation which faces both of the
other centers—Europe on the At
lantic and Japan on the Pacific. The
Pacific is bound to become of in
creasing importance.
"The bay area of San Francisco
will become a center of world af
fairs and Oriental influence. We
living here are going to be in the
heart of world affairs in a genera
tion or two."
Professor Gettell divided the for
eign policy of the United States into
three periods—the first from the
colonial times to th eMonroe Doc
trine, the second from the Monroe
Doctrine to the Spanish American
War, and the third from the Span
ish American War to the present.
"The Spanish American war
marked a turning point in Ameri
can history," he said. "Since then
our expansion has been external,
and we have been very active in
world politics."
