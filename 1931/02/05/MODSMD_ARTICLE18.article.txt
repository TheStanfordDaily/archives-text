# European Travel By Car Is Advised By U.C. Head
## 
### BEATRICE BISHOP 
I Touring by automobile is the only !
way to really see the countries of !
Europe in the opinion of Professor
Raymond S. Garfield Gettell, head
of the political science department !
of the University of California,
j "in no other way can one really i
learn to know and understand the
people of foreign countries," Pro
fessor Gettell said. "One must go )
into the interior and talk with the '
' people. You can get along very J
nicely with the English language j
I anywhere, and the American dollar j
' is eagerly accepted in any place. '
English is becoming an interna- j
tional language; nearly everybody |
; studies it.

j "European roads have been built
for military purposes, so they are
excellent," Professor Gettell con
tinued. But in northern Africa they
are in much poorer condition. In
many places it is possible to drive
right over the sand, following no
road in particular because it is ,
packed hard.
"American cars are much more
popular because they are faster and
more powerful, but the English and
I French have put a very high tariff

on them. Gas and oil are very ex
pensive, costing twice as much as
in the United States, but they are I
easy to buy. Parts are sometimes
1 harder to get."
Disease Is Common
One of the most striking things 1
Professor Gettell noticed about the
people in the less traveled parts of
I the countries was that they are sur- !
| prisingly dirty and diseased. "In i
| countries like Egypt, Algiers, and
Turkey half of the people seem de
' fective, diseased, lame, dirty," he
' said. "In the European countries i
they are poor as compared with i
| those of the United States, but many
j of them are comfortable."
Professor Gettell arrived in Ven
ice during the coldest winter in a j
i hundred years, and found the ca
nals frozen over—a sight which had
never been seen before.
He is now delivering a series of
I lectures on international events at
th Palo Alto Woman's Clubhouse
, (he first Wednesday of each month.
|He is a fascinating lecturer, and
j presents present-day problems in
I such a manner as to hold the at
tention of every member of the au
-1 dience. i

I Touring by automobile is the only !
way to really see the countries of !
Europe in the opinion of Professor
Raymond S. Garfield Gettell, head
of the political science department !
of the University of California,
j "in no other way can one really i
learn to know and understand the
people of foreign countries," Pro
fessor Gettell said. "One must go )
into the interior and talk with the '
' people. You can get along very J
nicely with the English language j
I anywhere, and the American dollar j
' is eagerly accepted in any place. '
English is becoming an interna- j
tional language; nearly everybody |
; studies it.
Koads Arc Excellent
j "European roads have been built
for military purposes, so they are
excellent," Professor Gettell con
tinued. But in northern Africa they
are in much poorer condition. In
many places it is possible to drive
right over the sand, following no
road in particular because it is ,
packed hard.
"American cars are much more
popular because they are faster and
more powerful, but the English and
I French have put a very high tariff

on them. Gas and oil are very ex
pensive, costing twice as much as
in the United States, but they are I
easy to buy. Parts are sometimes
1 harder to get."
Disease Is Common
One of the most striking things 1
Professor Gettell noticed about the
people in the less traveled parts of
I the countries was that they are sur- !
| prisingly dirty and diseased. "In i
| countries like Egypt, Algiers, and
Turkey half of the people seem de
' fective, diseased, lame, dirty," he
' said. "In the European countries i
they are poor as compared with i
| those of the United States, but many
