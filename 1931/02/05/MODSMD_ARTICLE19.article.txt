El Cainpo vs. Theta Chi,
postponed.

With Karl Falk, diminutive for
ward, looping in ten field goals for
a total of 20 points, Delta Chi's
basketball team won a 28-16 de
cision over Alpha Tau Omega last
night in the Encina gymnasium.
Encina V doubled th Kappa Sig
ma total to gain a 16-8 victory, and
Sequoia I, perhaps as a result of
their championship reputation, was
presented with a default by the Phi
Gams in the other games set for the
evening. El Campo and Theta Chi,
postponed their clash by mutual
agreement.
Four Games Tonight
Four games are scheduled for to
night: Los Arcos vs. Phi Delta
Theta in the Pavilion at 7 o'clock;
Phi Kappa Psi vs. Sigma Alpha Ep
silon in the gym at 7; Delta Tau
Delta vs. Business School in the
Pavilion at 8; Sequoia II vs. Theta
Xi in the gym at 8.
Falk's feat of counting 20 points
from the field was brought about
primarily by his uncanny eye for
the basket, but his fioorwork and
the passing of his two running
mates, Brown and Pearson were
also factors. Brown added 12 points
and Pearson 6 to the Delta Chi
total.
A.T.O.'s Tire
Despite the score run against
them, the A.T.O's were not hope
lessly outclassed and put up a fine
showing until they tired in the sec
ond half. They chose to match their
offensive against the sure shooting
forward trio of Delta Chi, thus mak
ing the game spectacular, but some
what disastrous for themselves.
Smith, Allen, and Arbuckle figured
in their offensive.
Karl Falk came within two buck
ets of beating Bob Goldwater's in
dividual high scoring record of the
season, 23 points, made when his
team, Sigma Chi steamrollered En
cina 2W. Goldwater, also counted
20 points in the preceding game.
Both he and Falk whenever they
get a set shot within 20 feet of the
bucket are dead eyes. Both ai*e op
portunists and clever at floorwork.
Both are candidates for the All-In
tramural team. Goldwater, who has
a superior supporting cast, also has
a slight edge in all-around play.
