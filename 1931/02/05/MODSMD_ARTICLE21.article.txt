# HOSPITAL IS SEEKING NEW WATER SUPPLY
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 4 (TP).â€”Un
less an adequate water supply can
be obtained, the Norwalk State Hos
pital must be abandoned as a state
institution, declared Dr. J. M. Toner,
director of institutions, here today.
The hospital property is almost
surrounded by oil wells, which con
taminate the present water supply,
Dr. Toner explained. He said a bill
had been introduced in the legisla
ture providing for purchase of land
next to the hospital site, and that
the bill would be amended to des
ignate certain property to be bought
after he and other state officials
make investigations.
