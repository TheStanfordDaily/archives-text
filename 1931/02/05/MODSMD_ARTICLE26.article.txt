## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 4
atlantic card sharps arc specializing
in bridge now. Sidney Lenz, bridge
master, back from abroad, has sized
them up. They do nothing so crude
as to spring marked cards or cold
decks. Changes of words and in
flections in bidding enable con
federates to tell the hands. They've
grabbed Sidney several times, but
haven't taken him over. In fact he
turned the tables on them, knowing
a trick or two himself.
