# INDIAN CAGERS BUILD OFFENSE TO DOWN TROY
## Bunn Stresses Quick Break to Get Ball Through Trojan Defense VICTORY SEEMS LIKELY 
### Stewart Crawford 
Three weeks ago today Coach
John Bunn and his squad of var
sity courtrnen began the strenuous
work of preparing an offense for the
express purpose of taking a couple
of ball games from a veteran quin
tet from Southern California which
was scheduled to invade the Farm
the following week-end.
Failing by three points to ac
complish their purpose in the first
encounter, the Indians proceeded to
break through the walls of Troy in
comparatively easy fashion in the
second tilt, thereby surprising that
veteran band of basketeers and let
ting the world know that Stanford
was not to be reckoned with lightly
in a basketball way.
Work on Attack
Yesterday the Cardinals again put
their noses to the proverbial grind
stone to work on a type of offense
slightly different from tho regular
plan of play, an attack fashioned
especially to crack through the Tro
jan defense, which is unlike that of
Stanford's other Coast Conference
opponents.
Especially is Bunn stressing the
quick break which his men must
employ to work the ball through
that airtight, man-to-man Trojan
guarding.
Practice Floor Work
The coach devoted some time to
fundamental floor play, pointing out
how the U.S.C. men had outshone
the Indians in individual perform
ance. He is taking precautions to
see that there is not a repetition
Saturday night of those fast, indi
vidual dribbles with which the Tro
jan forwards broke around the
Stanford guards to drop in setup
shots which were responsible for
the first U.S.C. victory.
In this third and deciding con
test, the chances for a Cardinal vic
tory look much brighter than before
the first meeting of the two teams.
Then, Stanford was in the cellar
position, having just returned from
a two-game trouncing at the hands
of the Bruin in the South.
Indians Confident
Saturday night it will be a more
confident Indian five, a quintet
which knows it is possible to beat
Troy, an outfit which has won its
last three games, one from each of
its three conference opponents.
However, it will also be a strong
er U.S.C. five playing on its home
court, a factor which plays a big
part in basketball. The added
strength of the southern aggrega
tion comes in the form of a star
named Nemer, who became eligible
just before the Trojan-California
j series last Saturday.
Tliis ex-L.A. high school hoop
| artist filled the shoes of Frank, the
I only Trojan basketeer who was not.
: a veteran from last year. Nemer
1 was high-point man in both of the
U.S.C.-Bear encounters, and seemed
i to be the fire plug of the squad.
