The recent move of the Executive Committee to individually
petition members of the faculty giving mid-quarter examinations
to remind their classes that the i lonor C ode is in existence at Stan
ford, comes after student leaders find too much Administration
red tape standing in their path towards fulfilling provisions of the
code.
The purpose of the committee is to acquaint students, who are
shortly to take their annual mid-quarters today, tomorrow and next
week, that it intends to lind an effective method to discourage cheat
ing and other violations of the code. a
In the educational scheme prepared by the student executives,
the co-operation of the faculty was deemed necessary so that each
student would be reminded in class that he or she had a definite part
'to play in the proper function of the honor system. The committee
deemed it best to bring this to student attention through the medium
of the instructor before each examination.
If the faculty consents to co-operate with the Executive Com
mittee in this latest move to enforce the code, and it is successful,
then an important step in the trisk of rejuvenating the honor code
has been accomplished.
