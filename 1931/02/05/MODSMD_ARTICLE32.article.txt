\cross the liny at Berkeley, University of California student
leaders arc bee*lining concerned over llie spirit being displayed about
the coining spring rally, where the Stanford Axe was formerly
brought to light, it concerned the editor of The Daily Californian
sn much that he wrote the following editorial:
"Yell leaders, managers, politicians and. generally speaking,
officers of the \.S.I are now settling down to a little serious
worrying over the fate of the spring rally. Last year, it seems we
had an objective in holding a conflagration in the (ireek Theatre ;
bnl now that we haven't any crude instruments to guard, opinion
has it that ( alifornia would expose herself to attacks on the grounds ■
of hypocrisy if she continued to maintain a tradition.
"Such an attitude is foolishly passive; it puts a chloroform i
blanket on enthusiasm just at the time, when a little vigorous respira- !
lion i> sadly needed. It the spring rally is abolished, the semester
will gradually assume the aspect of a drab, drawn out. spiritless but
necessary period between football seasons.
"It is granted that there should be an objective for a rally, one
that is able to inspire real feeling among the followers of the Colden
Hear. This semester. W ashington comes down to match her crews
against California's oarsmen in the Oakland estuary for the rowing!
championship of the I'acillc Coast —an event which never fails to]
excite the interest of sportsmen all over the west. What better!
incentive could be asked for a rally, outside the I'.ig Came itself?
"While these races only constitute a biennial event as far as the
Fast hay is concerned, the recent record turnout for track indicates I
that crew will not play a lone hand in l>ear sports this semester; j
while varsity baseball, which rose to great heights last April, gives
promise of another successful season.
' In view of the heavily-loaded sporting calendar for the next |
few months, it is necessary that team support be aroused. We need
a rally, and we need a good one. Spring with its connotations re-j
garding the reincarnation of things vernal, seems hardly adequate I
as a title for a yell feast: there should be a big rally, with a big lire. I
next April, and it should be the Axe Rally.
"To stille the support of an upward trend in spring sports be- !
cause a weapon of far fetched significance was stolen—would be j
hypocrisy."
