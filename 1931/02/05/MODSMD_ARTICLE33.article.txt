# STANFORD'S DRAMATIC FUTURE
## 
### 
Tomorrow night for the second time, a student cast will pre- '
sent "W ings Over Kurope,'' after popular demand, mostly from J
persons interested in Stanford living in this vicinity, convinced i
the Dramatic Council that the play could he produced profitably for'
a second time.
The initial performance of this play received an enthusiastic j
ovation from the small audience that was present. Instead of the .
usual half-hearted single encore the audience forced the cast to give |
three encores before the curtain could be rung down for the final i
time.
If "Wings Over Kurope" i> any indication of the future trend
of Stanford dramatics, they should attend tomorrow night's per
formance and see for themselves this new movement in campus
productions. If they appreciate it, they should say so. If they don't,
the>' should he doubly emphatic in making known their objections. '
Stanford's dramatics are for the entire community and the only
method whereby the community's likes may be determined is by
their constant attendance at various productions.
