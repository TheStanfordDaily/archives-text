A JEW IN LOVE—By Ben Hecht;
Coviei-Friede (at the Stanford
Bookstore).
With a savage mockery unknown
even in "The Front Page," Ben Hecht
acid-etches a Jew in love. A series
| of incidents in the erotic life of Jo
Boshere (born Nassbaum), com
-1 pose this interestingly wicked vol
■ ume.
Jo fluctuates like a weather cock
on a stormy day between his four
women: Bessie, the wife; Sara, the
disconcerting—insofar as he is con
cerned —virgin; Tilly, the passion
j ate dancer; and Alice, the long-term
j mistress. He quarrels to great and
boririg lengths, mouths the plati
tudes of others, poses as an author
ity on anything, occasionally glances
J toward his publishing business.
The book is too savage. Hecht,
completely the warring scoffer,
would be more rationalistic if he
I would convince.

The book would appear to be
headed toward suppression's doubt
ful fame if toward no other notice.

REDUCING at the Stanford Thea
ter. i
Here we have again (hat riotous
combination of Marie Dressier and
Folly Moran. "Reducing" is even
better than the last Dressler-Moran
scream, "Caught Short."
It isn't the plot that makes such
pictures the success they are, it's ,
Marie's comical faces and Polly's
own peculiar manner. Then of 1
of course the lines are funny and
the situations utterly natural and j
always amusing.
Anita Page and Lucien Littlefield
are very nice and furnish the nec
essary love interest excellently. All
in nil "Reducing" is one of those !
shows assured of success as long as
(here is no overproduction of iike
pictures.
