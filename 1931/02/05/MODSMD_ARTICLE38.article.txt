## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emeri
tus of geology and author of the
recently published book, "Living
Africa," talked to the Boys' League
of the Palo Alto Union High School
Tuesday on his trip into the dark
continent.
He stressed the superiority of the
white man over the black but con
cluded by telling his audience that
"we are the gorilla's first cousins."
The gorilla, he explained, has not
learned to use his feet as hands,
thus giving him a chance to develop
hi brain.
