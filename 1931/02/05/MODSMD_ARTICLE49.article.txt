—AND THE OUTCOME?
. Saturday night in Los Angeles,
the Stanford cagers will face a re
juvenated Trojan quintet in the
final and deciding encounter in a
three-game series. Aside from the
Stanford-U.S.C. series, the outcome
of the P.C.C. hoop race may hinge
upon the result of the game.
Not only are all of the Con
ference teams very much in the
running for (he championship of
the league, but also it would ap- •
pear that the Trojans will be the
team to beat from here on. With
a brand-new center who ap
pears to be the spark-plug of
the Trojan machine, Sam Bar
ry's outfit took two games from
California last week, and bid
fair to take one from Stanford
this week.
But the Indians in the past have
never bitten the dust until the game
ended, and judging from past per
formances the Red.shirts stand at
least an even chance against the
Trojans. In fact, that ball game,
like the majority of Conference
jousts, will in all probability be
settled in the last 45 seconds of
play.
But. more than any other fac
tor in the race will be the out
come of the Bear-Bruin twin
bill on Friday and Saturday
nights. These duels will be
fought in dear old Harmon gym
nasium—or perhaps we should
say old Harmon gymnasium.
The mere fact that Harmon is
the site of the combat makes
California a heavy favorite, and
it will be no surprise to us if
the Bears move back up to the
top of the list again.
This tall Lubin of U.C.L.A., by
(he way, struck us as being about
60 per cent of the Bruin team. He
not only controlled the tip-off a
large part of the time against Stan
ford, but he was the mainstay of
the Bruin defense and ihe key-man
of the offense. It seems lhat the
outstanding Conference cagers are
all guards this season, with Cald
weil of S.C., Coffield of California,
Lubin of the Uclans, and Fawcett
of Stanford, all stars.
Next week, the Farm will be
the locale for as bitter a clash
as one could hope to see. The
second Stanford-California hoop
epic should be even better than
the first, and the first was jam
med with thrills from Rintala's
Opening long shot to Mo Halt's
closing sucker shot. The Santa
Clara game may not be so hor
rible, either.
Never have we seen a game which
could compare to the rccent Pa
cific-Indian farce, however. With
a total of something like 37 fouls,
both personal and technical, with
the clumsiest exhibition of court
work to be had in. a varsity game,
it is best forgotten as soon as pos
sible.
.And so. with the Trojan and
California encounters on his
mind, Bunn can sing with Gil
bert and Sullivan that '"a hoop
coach's life is net a happy one,
happy one." Bui if the game
ends down South Saturday night
with the Cardinals out in front,
there is a great deal to be said
for the coaching racket. But
two more weeks, and Bunn can
begin to worry about next sea
son. —L.K., Jr.

(he way, struck us as being about
60 per cent of the Bruin team. He
not only controlled the tip-off a
large part of the time against Stan
ford, but he was the mainstay of
the Bruin defense and ihe key-man
of the offense. It seems lhat the
outstanding Conference cagers are
all guards this season, with Cald
weil of S.C., Coffield of California,
Lubin of the Uclans, and Fawcett
of Stanford, all stars.
Next week, the Farm will be
the locale for as bitter a clash
as one could hope to see. The
second Stanford-California hoop
epic should be even better than
the first, and the first was jam
med with thrills from Rintala's
Opening long shot to Mo Halt's
closing sucker shot. The Santa
Clara game may not be so hor
rible, either.
Never have we seen a game which
could compare to the rccent Pa
cific-Indian farce, however. With
a total of something like 37 fouls,
both personal and technical, with
the clumsiest exhibition of court
work to be had in. a varsity game,
it is best forgotten as soon as pos
sible.

California encounters on his

bert and Sullivan that '"a hoop
coach's life is net a happy one,
happy one." Bui if the game

there is a great deal to be said
for the coaching racket. But
two more weeks, and Bunn can

. Saturday night in Los Angeles,
the Stanford cagers will face a re
juvenated Trojan quintet in the
final and deciding encounter in a
three-game series. Aside from the
Stanford-U.S.C. series, the outcome
of the P.C.C. hoop race may hinge
upon the result of the game.
Not only are all of the Con
ference teams very much in the
running for (he championship of
the league, but also it would ap- •
pear that the Trojans will be the
team to beat from here on. With
a brand-new center who ap
pears to be the spark-plug of
the Trojan machine, Sam Bar
ry's outfit took two games from
California last week, and bid
fair to take one from Stanford
this week.
But the Indians in the past have
never bitten the dust until the game
ended, and judging from past per
formances the Red.shirts stand at
least an even chance against the
Trojans. In fact, that ball game,
like the majority of Conference
jousts, will in all probability be
settled in the last 45 seconds of
play.
But. more than any other fac
tor in the race will be the out
come of the Bear-Bruin twin
bill on Friday and Saturday
nights. These duels will be
fought in dear old Harmon gym
nasium—or perhaps we should
say old Harmon gymnasium.
The mere fact that Harmon is
the site of the combat makes
California a heavy favorite, and
it will be no surprise to us if
the Bears move back up to the
top of the list again.
