# Indians Lose Opening Game To Kenealy Seals
## VARSITY DEFEATED BY CITY PLAYERS BY SCORE OF 8-3 Third Inning Proves Fatal For Stanford Indians Millsap Stars 
### FRANK LLOYD 
The Kenealy Seals slapped down
the ambitious Indians in the open
ing game of the local season here
yesterday to the tune of 8-3. A sud
den and unexplainable case of
1 aboulia, scientific name for not being
' able to make up one's mind, at
tacked the left side of the Stanford
infield during the third inning and
1 resulted in the Seals pushing over
; four runs and clinching the ball
game.
I During the course of this disease
Gearin cracked out a single, and
(Donovan collected a double which
was enough to score four runs for
the Seals. Later in the fifth inning
the city outfit chalked up two more
markers, to nullify the effect of the
Indian rally which netted three runs
in their half of the fifth. Hunken
sent three Redskins scampering
across the plate when he hit a wick
ed cut to center field.
Good Indian Defense
Eliminating the third inning ca
! tastrophe, the Stanford nine showed
' promise of considerable ability on
the defense. However, the hitting
of the team as a whole was not of
a high order. Captain Hunken col
j lected two fo his team's eight hits,
while Cook and Dykes Johnson ac
i counted for two each, and Philippi
| and Eadie got one apiece to com
j plete the total.
Roy Johnson, of the Kenealy
! Seals, was the outstanding performer
of the game, having scored three
i runs and cavorted about the out
| field in a business-like way. Joe
Cronin who played short stop for
the city outfit made quite a few
hard plhyo seem comparatively easy,
and did not disappoint anyone who
came to see the American League
! star in action.
Pitching is Steady
For the first game of the season,
j the pitching for the Stanford aggre
j gation was decidedly encouraging.
Dan Johnson, who pitched the first
j three innings for the Indians, had
i complete control of the spheroid
! while' he was on the mound, and if
jit hadn't been for shaky support of
j his teammates, Johnson might have
got off without being nicked for any
runs.
Millsap, who threw them over for
two innings, was the only Indian to
. keep the Seals scoreless, and in ad
ministering his whitewash he made
! some of the Seal '"heavies" swing
| lustily at that most important of all
strikes—the third.
Nine errors and the inability, for
the most part, to hit in the pinches
were the fundamental reasons why
the Farm diamond performers once
again bowed in defeat to the care
; fully trained Seals. Both of these
j faults are more or less expected in
j any first encounter, and the fans
j need not despair for happier results
: later on.
Members of both teams seemed to
experience no little difficulty in
maintaining an upright position be
cause of the wet diamond. Several
j unintentional slides were made into
the sacks because of the "treacherous
instability."

Gearin cracked out a single, and

Indian rally which netted three runs
in their half of the fifth. Hunken

across the plate when he hit a wick

Good Indian Defense
Eliminating the third inning ca

' promise of considerable ability on
the defense. However, the hitting
of the team as a whole was not of
a high order. Captain Hunken col

while Cook and Dykes Johnson ac

of the game, having scored three

hard plhyo seem comparatively easy,
and did not disappoint anyone who
