# THE
						RED MENACE
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
j A rough, tough gent is Mr. Red
j Dutton of the New York Ameri
i cans Hockey Club. A lad who likes
the going best when the melee is
the hottest, who is happiest when
sticks are thrashing in the air and
| razor-edge steel blades flashing
I here and there, with men going
| down onto the hard ice in crunch
i ing body checks, and here and there
j a fist meeting a jaw or a nose.
Coming to the Americans from
! the Montreal Maroons, and under
i a new manager, Eddie Gerard, Red
j has helped transform the A's into
| a much more interesting outfit than
j they were last season. The pugna
i cious red-head is well liked by the
j fans, and his fine playing merits his
1 popularity.
| Right now Rod is laid up with a
! damaged eyeball, which unfortun
j ately came into contact with the end
| of somebody's stick in a recent con
| test. Wounds are not new to broth
ier Dutton, however. Back in 1917
i in Fiance he met up socially with
| a German shell and the war had to

| do without Red from that time on.
The then 18-year-old Canadian
| had pieces of shrapnel in his right
hip and left side, and still carries
i some of it in his side. He's a human
projectile, if you ask some of his
j opponents whom this terror on
j skates has upset in the brilliantly
hard and fierce play for which he
1 is noted.
Red went to school at Russell,
Manitoba, where the other kids soon
; learped to call him Red instead of
Mervyn. He played hockey for St.
: John's College in Winnipeg (he was
; studying there when he left to en
-1 list in the Princess Pats at the age
of 16.) Later he joined the Calgary
team of the Western Hockey League
and then the Maroons.
Probably Red has toned down the
brand of knock-'em-down and drag
'em-out hockty that he used to play,
for a more strategic brand, but he
still is an utterly fearless desperado
on blades to rival puck carriers, who
if they read the first part of this
sentence would probably say, "How
i do you mean, 'used to'?"
