their first intercollegiate match of
the season at 8 o'clock tonight in
the Pavilion.
Coach Harry Maloney announced
at yesterday afternoon's squad prac
tice that Miller would replace Jim
Kelley in the line-up, and his pres
ence in the ring tonight should bol
ster Stanford's chance of winning
considerably. ''Miller is the best
welter we've had at Stanford since
the time of Jon Murphy, who fought
about ten years ago," Maloney
states.
Opening Bantamweight
Tonight's card will open with a
bantamweight bout between Yuji
lanii of Stanford and Max Thomp
son. The other encounters of the
program are as follows: Fred Glo
ver, Stanford, vs. Cliff Devine, Na

ford, vs. Wally Rusk or Bernard
York, light-heavies; and Paul Tar
ghetta, Stanford, vs. Al Theis, Ne

Yesterday afternoon the Indian
leather-pushers skipped rope, and
wrestled arodnd, and shadow boxed

tough antagonists in Glover, Rog
ers, Miller, and Johnson. These
boxers have been improving rap

they are at the place now where
they can make an interesting eve
ning for any college opponents.
Students will be admitted to the
Pavilion free upon presentation of

York, light-heavies; and Paul Tar
ghetta, Stanford, vs. Al Theis, Ne

two-minute rounds. The same of
ficials who handled the University
championships last week will be on

Niderost and Al Sandell, judges.
Yesterday afternoon the Indian
leather-pushers skipped rope, and
wrestled arodnd, and shadow boxed
through a light final workout. To
day they will weigh-in at 1 o'clock,
along with the Nevada fighters, who
will come down from San Fran
cisco this morning. After weights
are chalked, Maloney's crew will re
tire to a hotel in Palo Alto to rest

Matches Equal
With the addition of Miller to the
team, Stanford's possibilities seem
about equal to those of the Wolf
Pack in copping intercollegiate hon
ors tonight. The Reno outfit has a
lineup-of veteran and clever boxers,
but they wiil meet particularly
tough antagonists in Glover, Rog
ers, Miller, and Johnson. These
boxers have been improving rap
idly under the tutelage of Maloney
and his assistant, Myron Schall, and
they are at the place now where
they can make an interesting eve
ning for any college opponents.
Students will be admitted to the
Pavilion free upon presentation of
student body cards. General ad
mission is $1, with a special price
of fifty cents for high school stu
dent^.
Dick Miller, who has turned out
for the varsity since he won the
University championship in the wel
terweight division, will handle the
welter assignment against Nevada,
whom the Indian boxers meet in
their first intercollegiate match of
the season at 8 o'clock tonight in
the Pavilion.
Coach Harry Maloney announced
at yesterday afternoon's squad prac
tice that Miller would replace Jim
Kelley in the line-up, and his pres
ence in the ring tonight should bol
ster Stanford's chance of winning
considerably. ''Miller is the best
welter we've had at Stanford since
the time of Jon Murphy, who fought
about ten years ago," Maloney
states.
Opening Bantamweight

bantamweight bout between Yuji
lanii of Stanford and Max Thomp
son. The other encounters of the
program are as follows: Fred Glo
ver, Stanford, vs. Cliff Devine, Na

ford vs. Joe Horton or Elmer Haw
kins, lightweights.
Miller, Stanford, vs. Robert Har
ris or Harry Whitehead, welters;
Captain Fred Johnson, Stanford, vs.
