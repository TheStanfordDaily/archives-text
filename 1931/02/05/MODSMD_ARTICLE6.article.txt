# ADAMS RETICENT ON BUTLER CASE
## Counsel Denies Scandal Is Defense Basis 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (/P).—A
series of charges described as "se
vere" rested tonight in the hands of
Major General Smedley D. Butler,
but the responsibility for their pub
lication immediately was passed by
him back to the Navy Department
whence they came.
Despite this indication that of
ficials had not softened their atti
tude toward his now celebrated ref
erence to Premier* Mussolini the
Marine General was said by Major
Henry Leonard, his counsel, to have
returned to his self-confinement at 1
Quantico, Va., with his "morale still
high."
Elude Reporters
Earlier, Butler and Leonard proved
they had lost none of the resource
fulness that characterized their days
as brother marine officers by elud
ing Washington correspondents for
hours. They spent virtually the en
tire day secretly preparing the de
fense to be presented at the court ,
martial in Philadelphia, February 16.
Secretary Adams, who late today
approved the charges and specifica
tions against General Butler, said i
tonight they certainly would not be
made public immediately, adding
"I guess we'll have to talk it over
tomorrow."
Bares Defense I'lan
Meanwhile, Major Leonard made
known some of the defense plans
for the trial. He said John D. Davis,
who had been mentioned as an at- j
torney for Butler, could not par
ticipate, but that another counsel,
also "nationally known" would be
retained.
"We intend to conduct our case j
strictly on the merits of the charge,"
Leonard said. "There is a clean cut i
issue involved and there will lac no
scandal-mongering or mud-sling
ing."
