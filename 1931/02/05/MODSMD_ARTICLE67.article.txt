# FROSH CAGE TEAM FACES HARD TILT WITH BRONCO FIVE
## Papoose Cagers Meet S.C. Babes Tuesday; Frosh to Play Grays 
### 
With the varsity traveling south
; for their third encounter with U.S.C.,
| no game has been scheduled for th<>
1 frosh basketeers. Saturday. The
babes' next contest will be with the
fast Santa Clara yearlings, Tuesday,
when a battle royal is expected.
Freshmen and grays left behind
will tangle in a scrimmage at
o'clock Saturday afternoon, but
otherwise there will be no basketball
activity on the campus this week
end.
Topping May Play
Topping, first string guard who
was injured in the California game,
is still in the hospital but is ex
pected to be back in the lineup next,
j week. He may be able to start
j against Santa Clara, and is almost,
j certain to be ready for the second
I Bear Cub game a week from Sat
i urday.
Coach John Bunn continued his
i drill on fundamentals in yesterday's
practice, the results of which are
! increasingly noticeable. The frosh
| handled the ball nicely in their
j game Tuesday with the Pacific
! yearlings, presenting a smoothly
I working attack and tight defense.
Free Throws Good
j The free throw department finds
j the babes with little to be desired,
j the nonchalance with which they
j tanked their foul shots in the first,
j half of the Pacific game bringing
j laughs from the early-comers.
! Once Wright strode up to the line,
| tossed the casaba in the general di
i rection of the basket, and trotted
i back toward the center of the floor
with the ball still in the air. Maentz,
who by the way otherwise played
a good game, was the only habe to
| miss a single free try in the opening
| period.
I While the yearlings having appar
ently found their stride, Coach Bunn
believes the day of reckoning may
be at hand, for Santa Clara has a
rangy lot of frosh who can be ex
pected to give a good account of
themselves.
