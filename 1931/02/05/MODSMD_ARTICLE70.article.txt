That the bond of appreciation of

The subject of Dr. Kroll's lecture
was ''The Influence of Ancient

He outlined the principle features
of the Grecian theatre including the
atmosphere of oppression, the in
troduction of the plot and charac
ters, and the presentation of the he

cussed the change brought about by
the writers of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries in regard to
the subject and treatment of their
drama. â€¢
