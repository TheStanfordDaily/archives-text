# DEATH TOLL NEARS THOUSAND MARK N.Z. EARTH TREMOR

NAPIER, New Zealand, Feb. 4 (/P).
â€”The bodies of fifty-seven victims,
killed when Tuesday's earthquake
virtually wiped this bustling sea
port from the may, had been identi
fied today, while more than 1,000
injured, several hundred of them in
a critical condition, had been treated.
No official estimate of the num
ber of dead had yet been attempted,
but popular belief and the unofficial
estimates of relief workers placed it
at more than 500 and possibly as
many as 1,000 for Napier, Hastings
and other towns of Hawkes Bay
Province in the earthquake affected
zone.
All efforts were spent today in
aiding the injured, searching the
ruins for still living victims and pre
paring for a general evacuation of
the city before disease can follow in
the footsteps of disaster.
