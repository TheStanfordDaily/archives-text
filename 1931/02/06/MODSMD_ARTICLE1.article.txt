# INDIAN CAGERS LEAVE TONIGHT FOR TROY TILT
## Fifteen Men to Make Trip; Trojan Victory Would Blast Title Hopes GAME DECIDES SERIES 
### 
By Jack Jernegan
Stanford's basketball talent, as
represented by 15 husky varsity
men and Coach John Bunn, will
board the Lark this evening bound
for Los Angeles where they have
an important engagement with the
U.S.C. hosts of Troy. The Indian
eagers will clash with the Trojans
tomorrow night in the third and de
ciding game of their 1931 series.
More than a mere series victory
lies at stake in this encounter, how
ever. Stanford and U.S.C. are at
present tied in second place in the
conference standings, just one game
behind the league-leading U.C.L.A.
Bruin and just one game ahead of
the California Bears. The team that
loses out tomorrow night will be
practically eliminated from the race
for the southern diivsion champion
ship, while the victor will be within
striking distance of the title.
Both Teams Strong
The present position of the two
teams in the standings just about in
dicates their relative strength as
they prepare for the final tilt. Last
month they divided a double pro
gram here, close scores being in evi
dence on each occasion.
Since then both aggregations have
picked up in apparent power. Hav
ing found themselves in the second
contest with the Trojans, the Cardi
nal hoopsters have accelerated no
ticeably in their play as is evidenced
by their victories over California
and U.C.L.A.
Nemer Is Threat
After bowing to the Bruins the
U.S.C. team picked up a newly eli
gible star, Jerry Nemer by name, at
the weak center position and pro
ceeded to surprise the Golden Bears
irom Berkeley in two successive
contests. This sudden spurt has
made the Trojans look like the
strongest quintet in the conference.
Since both aggregations appear
much stronger now than when they
met before, it is evident that a stren
uous time will be had by all tomor
row night. The team that comes out
on top will probably have no more
than one or two points of margin.
Bunn Takes 15 Men
To use in the attempt to subdue
the southern team Coach Bunn will
take a squad of 15 with him. The
members of the group who will
make the trip were announced yes
terday ak follows:
Forwards: Moffatt, Cordry, Meade,
Palmer, Tyler, Hepp; centers: Doub
and Reynolds; guards: Fawcett, Rin
tala, Baker, Hancock, Tway, Mears,
McElwain.
Bunn will probably start Cordry,
Moffatt, Reynolds, Fawcett, and Rin
tala.
