# CARNEGIE MEDAL WAITS NINE YEARS FOR LUMBERJACK
## 
### 
SPOKANE, Feb. 5 MYâ€”H. Her
shel Mott, who probably is bulling
logs with a pike pole in some north
west timber country stream, ought
to come to Spokane; there's a Car
negie hero medal here for him.
Nearly nine years ago Mott leaped
into a mill pond in an unsuccessful
effort to save three young people
from drowning. His friends saw to
it that his bravery was recognized
by the Carnegie committee.
That much of the story is known;
the second chapter is blank.
A realtor here, supervising the
cleaning of a house just vacated by
a second-hand dealer, kicked into
a pile of rubbish and found the
medal. Whether Mott ever received
it, or whether, even, he knew his
rescue attempt had been considered
more than the expected effort of a
man to save the life of others in
peril, it is not known here.
The medal was turned over to a
newspaper here, and Mott may have
it if he comes after it.
