# Prohi Report Summary Misleads, Says Barclay
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Amazing discrepancies between |
the Wickersham report and the
summary attached to it serve to j
blindfold the implication contained ;
in the text, according to Thomas S.
Barclay, associate professor of po- j
lilicai science.
"The summary makes the report
seem more favorable to national
prohibition than the facts warrant," |
says Barclay. "Seven members of
the commission favor the immediate
abandonment of constitutional pro
hibition, and two more are ready to j
do so, if enforcement is not speed- j
ily secured.'
"The entire membership adopts a i
defeatist attitude," Barclay assert
ed. "Most of them advocate plans
which involve, in substance, an un
doing of the Eighteenth Amend
ment."
Future success of prohibition, by
the Wickersham report, rests on)

two factors.—co-operation of the
states and greater voluntary observ
ance by the people.
"There is nothing new in either
of these forlorn hopes," declares
Barclay. "Only an optimist can im
agine the American public heeding
such a pious admonition as volun
tary observance. While the states
are neither morally or legally bound
to assist in the enforcement of na
tional prohibition."
■ Better enforcement of the exist
ing law is suggested under nine
points by the report. Barclay, sum
ming them up, says: "Some of these
are inconsequential, the rest de
mand more men and more money."
The commission seems to believe
that the present situation is not
only intolerable but is rapidly get
ting beyond control. And, as Bar
clay sees it, the problem of a vast,
unregulated and untaxed liquor
traffic remains unsolved.
