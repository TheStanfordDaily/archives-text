## Dick Miller Loses Decision to Visiting Slugger in Extra Round Bout; Glover Knocks Out Nevada Featherweight in Third Frame VISITORS WIN IN HEAVY, LIGHTHEAVY BOUTS 
### FRITZ GOODWIN 
Dropping his man for a count of seven with a right uppercut just
alter the opening hell, and then knocking him groggy in the corner with
a vicious left hook, Captain Fred Johnson, Stanford middleweight, was
awarded a technical knockout over Kenneth Austin for the fourth decision
in the 4to Indian boxing win from Nevada in the Pavilion last night.
After a few seconds of sparring Johnson worked his man over to
the ropes and landed square on the button with his deadly right, putting

* Austin on the floor. The Nevada
! middleweight got up unsteadily and
| was making an easy target for
: Johnson's left when Referee Flani
j gan stopped the bout.
In the most sensational slugging
! match of the program, Bob Harris
got an extra-round decision over
Dick Miller, flashy Stanford welter.
Both fighters employed wide, hook
ing attacks, and during the entire
encounter stood toe 1o toe exchang
ing blows to the head. Miller's hooks
packed more steam in the first two
rounds, but ,he missed time and
again when Horton stood dazed in
the center of the ring.
After the third bell, lack of con
dition began to tell on the Indian
boxer, and Harris landed oftener
on Miller's tiring head and body. In
the fourth period both men were
staggering and clinching continual
ly, but Harris was clearly pounding
out his decision.
Fred Glover had his hand hoisted
for a technical K.O. in the third
round of his featherweight melee
with Nevada's Cliff Devine. After
an even but fast opening frame,
Glover came out fast in the second
and landed a series of jarring rights,
chasing Devine all over the canvas.
It was the same story in the third,
the affair ending when Devine was
helpless on the ropes.
Targhetta Loses
Paul "Red" Targhetta lost athrec
round decision to Ihe big Al Theis
of Reno in the heavyweight match.
Theis' longer reach and greater
height enabled him to pummel the
Stanford man at will from long
range, but at close quarters slug
ging honors were about even. By
the end of the bout both men w<?re
weak and tottering. Targhctta's
stout heart and ability to take it
were all that put him over the full
route.
Yuji Imai, of Stanford, got the
nod over Max Thompson in the firs<
regular fight of the card. Both of
the bantam battlers showed speed
and power, but Imai's greater fresh
ness in the final round gave him
the advantage.
Vance Rogers, Indian lightweight,
won a close extra-round decision
from Joe Horton of the Wolf Pack.
The fight was purely a boxing match
from start to finish, with Rogers'
longer reach and harder right hook
deciding the issue.
The light-heavyweight match be
tween Gordon Gilbert, Indian, and
Wally Rusk was the slowest bout
of the evening. Both men played a
waiting game in the first tv/o
rounds. Not until the third was tho
first solid punch landed, when Rusk
connected to hhe head with his
straight right frequently enough to
get the judges' decision.
In the two exhibition matches be
fore the main events, Ray Mulvanc,
Stanford, and Elmer Hawkins, Ne

Joe Niderost and Al Santlo]
judged the bouts, with Peter Flan
igan officiating within the ropes.
Timers were Fred Frehc and My
ron Spraguc, while Phil Moffatt did
the announcing.
Dropping his man for a count of seven with a right uppercut just
alter the opening hell, and then knocking him groggy in the corner with
a vicious left hook, Captain Fred Johnson, Stanford middleweight, was
awarded a technical knockout over Kenneth Austin for the fourth decision
in the 4to Indian boxing win from Nevada in the Pavilion last night.
After a few seconds of sparring Johnson worked his man over to
the ropes and landed square on the button with his deadly right, putting

* Austin on the floor. The Nevada
! middleweight got up unsteadily and
| was making an easy target for
: Johnson's left when Referee Flani
j gan stopped the bout.
In the most sensational slugging
! match of the program, Bob Harris
got an extra-round decision over
Dick Miller, flashy Stanford welter.
Both fighters employed wide, hook
ing attacks, and during the entire
encounter stood toe 1o toe exchang
ing blows to the head. Miller's hooks
packed more steam in the first two
rounds, but ,he missed time and
again when Horton stood dazed in
the center of the ring.
After the third bell, lack of con
dition began to tell on the Indian
boxer, and Harris landed oftener
on Miller's tiring head and body. In
the fourth period both men were
staggering and clinching continual
ly, but Harris was clearly pounding
out his decision.
Fred Glover had his hand hoisted
for a technical K.O. in the third
round of his featherweight melee
with Nevada's Cliff Devine. After
an even but fast opening frame,
Glover came out fast in the second
and landed a series of jarring rights,
chasing Devine all over the canvas.
It was the same story in the third,
the affair ending when Devine was
helpless on the ropes.
Targhetta Loses
Paul "Red" Targhetta lost athrec
round decision to Ihe big Al Theis
of Reno in the heavyweight match.
Theis' longer reach and greater
height enabled him to pummel the
Stanford man at will from long
range, but at close quarters slug
ging honors were about even. By
the end of the bout both men w<?re
weak and tottering. Targhctta's
stout heart and ability to take it
were all that put him over the full
route.
Yuji Imai, of Stanford, got the
nod over Max Thompson in the firs<
regular fight of the card. Both of
the bantam battlers showed speed
and power, but Imai's greater fresh
ness in the final round gave him
the advantage.
Vance Rogers, Indian lightweight,
won a close extra-round decision
from Joe Horton of the Wolf Pack.
The fight was purely a boxing match
from start to finish, with Rogers'
longer reach and harder right hook
deciding the issue.
The light-heavyweight match be
tween Gordon Gilbert, Indian, and
Wally Rusk was the slowest bout
of the evening. Both men played a
waiting game in the first tv/o
rounds. Not until the third was tho
first solid punch landed, when Rusk
connected to hhe head with his
straight right frequently enough to
get the judges' decision.
In the two exhibition matches be
fore the main events, Ray Mulvanc,
Stanford, and Elmer Hawkins, Ne

Stanford, and Paul Fontana, Nevada,
welters, put on interesting shows.
