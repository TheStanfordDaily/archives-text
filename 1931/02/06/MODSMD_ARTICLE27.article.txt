# A 						BIT LATE TO DETERMINE POLICY
## 
### 
The Inllow ing policy ;is to the conduct of The Daily is recom
mended to the editor of Volume 7 ( >, who assumes his post with the
puljJ icalion of the first issue of his regime Monday (it is not hind
in!/, however ) :
Kudeavor as much as possible to remain free and unbiased in
editorial actions and only assume such attitudes when the situation
calls for it. However, in spite of this seemingly no policy at all.
there are certain fundamentals that should be considered.
'I o explain this it is well to remember that The I )aily is a college
newspaper, for and by the students of this I niversity. It is not a
mere bulletin to record anounccments and such propaganda that
many organizations desire published. It should take a healthy in
terest in campus activities. If it does not approve of certain move
ments, it should privately approach the individual or organization
and express its dislike; should the disapproval continue, then The
Daily should conduct an attack, both in the news columns and in
the editorial columns, against the offending elements. If there is
lieartN approval of certain activities, this approval should be made
publicly. All criticism, good or bad or indifferent, should be con
structive.
The Daii.y owes an obligation to its readers and to fulfill this
obligation it is entitled to investigate anything its directors believe
i- injuring the cause of the student body, the I niversity, or even
the Lower Division.
There are situations about the campus and the I "niversity that
require investigations, both supporting and attacking. The most
important of them follow:
I here is the problem of equitable allotment of tickets to ath
letic events. Should the students receive first preference, should the
alumni, or should the general public? The answer is still to be
unearthed.
There is a need for educating the students to the realiza
tion that the honor code means something more than being
an "institution" in the University. The term, "honor code,"
is a conceded misnomer, but a name that would fit the situ
ation is yet to be found. Students should be brought to real
ize that cheating in examinations, class work, or anything that
is done for grades, is comparable to cheating yourself in
solitaire.
There is the question of allow ng fraternity and sororitv living
groups to build new quarters so as to do away with their present
ramshackle appearance on the campus. There is also the problem
of additional dormitories for students now residing in I'alo Alto.
There is the matter of University finances. The Univer
sity has been reported as having had to discharge 27 men from
their jobs because there was not sufficient money to justify
their working during the next three weeks. The University is
said, on reliable and trustworthy information that probably
will be confirmed by the comptroller's statement in the Presi
dent's Report, to have incurred a deficit in its operations dur
ing the past fiscal year. The idea that Stanford's endowment
is ample enough to allow it to do as it pleased should be
changed and persons shown that the financial situation is very
precarious.
liccause the University has no additional money to spend and
because of the apparent unwillingness of the\ physical education
department to re-budget its expenditures, the hope of ever having
a I niversity infirmary, where students will not be charged with
the upkeep of a costly community hospital, appears to be extremely
indefinite. I he present student health service is functioning in a
< apable manner, but its chief desire is to prevent illness, liccause
most students do not seek aid from the service until thev are sick,
ihe purpose of the service is thereby weakened and its effect lost
because the service has no adequate means for hospitalization or
proper emergency treatment.
Back of the financial situation lies the problem of the
bower Division. Temporarily resting while its sponsor, Dr.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, is occupying the chair of the secretary'
of the interior, the plan to restrict and then abolish, perma
nently, has aroused such antagonism from the alumni that
ihere has been little, if any, financial support from this source.
The plan to restrict the Lower Division is indirectly respon
sible for the increased tuition fees now being assessed new
members of the University.
\nd behind the indefinite situation created by the adoption of j
the restriction plans and the subsequent opposition which caused a
temporary delay, lies a factor which threatens to injure the aca
demic. reputation of the University. Faculty members are afraid the |
unsettled conditions are liable to endanger them and when replace j
incuts to the faculty are required, the contemplated instructors sliv I
from any proposals because their future here is unknown. Thus
the I Diversity is forced to lake what it can get.
And the Lower Division also affects athletics because, j

under the Pacific Coast Conference rules, students transfer-'
ring from junior colleges or institutions not awarding bache
lor's degrees are eligible to participate—Stanford is not get
-1 ting the athletic material that has been expected from the
! junior colleges. And under the present system of athletics,
no athlete, no matter how good or how poor he may be, will
enter a junior college because he way get into Stanford two
i years later.
Stanford's success in athletics during the past decade lias,
| brought in money which lias gone to campus improvements, which'
j the l'niversity itself could not afford to build. The Hoard of Ath
letic Control, foreseeing that gate receipts would result during a I
j period of years to come, spent more than it had at the time to
make these improvements. As a consequence, it is more than a half-1
million dollars in debt. With further restriction of the Lower l)i-!
I vision, the athletes who are capable of ablv representing Stanford,
would not pass the high requirements, and only those students who i
do little else than study would be able to make the. grade—thus
ability of teams to to draw crowds would be lessened and gate re
ceipts would drop.
I hen to cap it all, the tradition that the spirit of the student
! press shall be untrammeled and free to print what it mav as long as
the good name of the I niversity is not involved, should be allowed
1 to exist forever. 'I here should be no attempt to stifle it because a
l'niversity officer, a member of the faculty, or even a student, is
criticized because of selfish ambitions which appear to endanger llie!
I niversity.
To sum it up, Stanford should exist for Stanford.

There is a need for educating the students to the realiza

an "institution" in the University. The term, "honor code,"
is a conceded misnomer, but a name that would fit the situ

There is the question of allow ng fraternity and sororitv living
groups to build new quarters so as to do away with their present

their jobs because there was not sufficient money to justify
their working during the next three weeks. The University is
said, on reliable and trustworthy information that probably
will be confirmed by the comptroller's statement in the Presi

is ample enough to allow it to do as it pleased should be

precarious.
liccause the University has no additional money to spend and
because of the apparent unwillingness of the\ physical education
department to re-budget its expenditures, the hope of ever having
a I niversity infirmary, where students will not be charged with
the upkeep of a costly community hospital, appears to be extremely
indefinite. I he present student health service is functioning in a

most students do not seek aid from the service until thev are sick,
ihe purpose of the service is thereby weakened and its effect lost
because the service has no adequate means for hospitalization or
proper emergency treatment.
Back of the financial situation lies the problem of the
bower Division. Temporarily resting while its sponsor, Dr.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, is occupying the chair of the secretary'
of the interior, the plan to restrict and then abolish, perma

ihere has been little, if any, financial support from this source.
The plan to restrict the Lower Division is indirectly respon
sible for the increased tuition fees now being assessed new
members of the University.
\nd behind the indefinite situation created by the adoption of j
the restriction plans and the subsequent opposition which caused a
temporary delay, lies a factor which threatens to injure the aca
demic. reputation of the University. Faculty members are afraid the |
unsettled conditions are liable to endanger them and when replace j
incuts to the faculty are required, the contemplated instructors sliv I
from any proposals because their future here is unknown. Thus
the I Diversity is forced to lake what it can get.
And the Lower Division also affects athletics because, j

under the Pacific Coast Conference rules, students transfer-'

lor's degrees are eligible to participate—Stanford is not get

no athlete, no matter how good or how poor he may be, will
enter a junior college because he way get into Stanford two

Stanford's success in athletics during the past decade lias,

make these improvements. As a consequence, it is more than a half-1
million dollars in debt. With further restriction of the Lower l)i-!

calls for it. However, in spite of this seemingly no policy at all.
there are certain fundamentals that should be considered.
'I o explain this it is well to remember that The I )aily is a college
newspaper, for and by the students of this I niversity. It is not a
mere bulletin to record anounccments and such propaganda that
many organizations desire published. It should take a healthy in
terest in campus activities. If it does not approve of certain move
ments, it should privately approach the individual or organization
and express its dislike; should the disapproval continue, then The
Daily should conduct an attack, both in the news columns and in
the editorial columns, against the offending elements. If there is

There are situations about the campus and the I "niversity that
require investigations, both supporting and attacking. The most
important of them follow:
I here is the problem of equitable allotment of tickets to ath
letic events. Should the students receive first preference, should the
alumni, or should the general public? The answer is still to be
unearthed.
There is a need for educating the students to the realiza
tion that the honor code means something more than being
an "institution" in the University. The term, "honor code,"
is a conceded misnomer, but a name that would fit the situ
ation is yet to be found. Students should be brought to real
ize that cheating in examinations, class work, or anything that
is done for grades, is comparable to cheating yourself in
solitaire.
There is the question of allow ng fraternity and sororitv living
groups to build new quarters so as to do away with their present
ramshackle appearance on the campus. There is also the problem
of additional dormitories for students now residing in I'alo Alto.
There is the matter of University finances. The Univer
sity has been reported as having had to discharge 27 men from
their jobs because there was not sufficient money to justify
their working during the next three weeks. The University is
said, on reliable and trustworthy information that probably
will be confirmed by the comptroller's statement in the Presi

is ample enough to allow it to do as it pleased should be
