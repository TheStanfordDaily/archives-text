I THE FIRST YEAR—At the Alca
! zar Theater, San Francisco.
Once upon a time someone dis
: covered that the first year of mar
j ried life was the hardest. Henry
Duffy and Dale Winter demon -
| strate the truth of difficult "first
: years," appearing as the young
1 young couple leaving their small
I home town to make their fortunes.
Tommy's former rival apparent
; ly spoils their hopes of success, and
| Grace leaves, expecting Tommy to
I follow. But leave it to the Uncle
Myrons, who will always help the
young couple to at their first
quarrels.
Henry Duffy's drawling and con
tinually inflected lines drag. Lloyd
Neal as Grace's father is by far
the best in the cast. For a simple,
amusing little play—the children
need not be left at home—' The
First Year" will satisfy. —J.N.
THE LASH—at the Varsity Thea
ter.
This is the type of a show that
makes one wonder if romance is
not dead in these modern quasi
sophisticated days. If you are one
of those so-called college cynics
"The Lash" won't appeal to you,
but if you can forget yourself long
enough to enjoy ranches and ban
dits and the colorful days of 3848,
you will be entertained. j

"The Lash" is a tale of the quar
rels of the California land owners
and the Yankees after the Mexican
' war. The plot is not unusual but
' exciting. The actors, Richard Bar
| thelmess, Mary Astor and Marion
j Dixon, give good performances. Be
i sides there are those ever neces
; sary factors: color, suspense and
j love in a glamorous setting.
To all those who think they can
enjoy such an excellent combina
tion without a sneer, "The Lash" is
recommended. —N.J.
I EVA—By Jacques Cadronnc. Si
mon and Schuster. New York,
j 1931. Translated by Viola G. Gar
| vin. (At Stanford Bookstore. $2).
This novel is written in the form
of a diary of the principal charac
ter. He sacrifices all of his per
sonal pleasures for his wife, and he
thinks that he understands her per
fectly and has made her happy,
i The climax comes when she tires
of him arid is divorced.
The book is dull. The author
comments upon anything that
comes to his mind and a good many
of the comments are not worth
reading. Just another attempt at
stream - of-consciousness ('narration
has failed to result in anything
worthy of notice. —E.E.W.
