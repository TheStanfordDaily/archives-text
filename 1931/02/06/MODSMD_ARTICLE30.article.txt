Rollins University, which re
cently shocked the* educational
world by abolishing professors, text
books, and other implements of the
usual college, has established a class
in "Love Making."
Just further proof that col
leges are becoming too practi
cal. Classes in love making will
only serve to standardize (he
"lines."
Chaperones at Syracuse Univer
sity are requested to keep all rooms
lighted and see that rooms are not
used as sitting salons between the
dances.
And these necessary appendages
to campus affairs should also shine
flashlights into all parked cars at
intervals of not greater than ten
minutes.

Barnard College gives full class \
credit for students in sleeping
courses. Any lired student may en- j
roll.
Hut American college students
are not after units and most of
them will sleep in class without
credit.
As a special concession to seniors !
of Lynchburg College, ibey are al- j
lowed to make dates with permis
sion of the administration, and leave
the campus after six in the evening <
without an O.K.
Such lack of control of the co-eds j
is sure to bring dire results.
