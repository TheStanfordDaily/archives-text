# CABBAGES and Things..

### 
Concerning the recent flurry
about Stanford women taking part
in intercollegiate athletics, there is
copious information still to be dis
closed. For instance, we went over
to interview one of the teaching
staff, on the subject. It was just at
the end of a class period. His voice
boomed out:
"Oh. MUSKELUNGE, when
you fence? That's all for
today. Yes, you're FINISHED.
Ou the scales! . . . ."
We, mentioned it timidly, last
week, but nothing seems to have
been done about it. Brethren and
sistern, we must band together and
light shoulder to shoulder against
the latest fad to wind its insidious
tentacles around the fair Stanford
co-ed. (We've been reading a col
umn written in 1900.) The Demon
Bicycle must be kept from Roble
and the Row. Their souls must be
saved, even if we have to about
it.
The next step is scooters, and then,
doubtless, roller skates to match
the dancing sandals the Silly Sopho
mores are wearing on Quad. At this
time of year? Tsk!
And while we're on campus
fashions, we recommend for your
inspection the very latest in
sweaters, being paraded by
courageous frosh. The effect is
something like a bath-towel
gone wrong. Too hud modern
Pullman towels aren't larger,
so we could have another in
triguing suit on our hands.
A pastel-minded upper-classman
is going in for delicately-hued cord
uroys. He insists that white cords
are monotonous, and that Spring
has came. Oh for a fraternity house
dining room that blooms like the
flowers in May, tra-la!
Tonight, the Indians will take the
trail South again. And the boys at
home will celebrate in Western style.
The Sigma Chis have to whoop it
up (publicly) at least once a year.
The ATO's are turning rustic, and
the Daily staff; old and not so an
cient, will dine "with cjuiet dig
nity." (See Emily Post.) At least,
now you have a social calendar
(omitting the usual over-the-week
end at-homes held by every worth
while fraternity group).
Proof positive that Cabbages'
taste is good, they're re-doing
'"Wings Over Europe," tonight.
May the Prime Minister's tie
keep at a discreet angle all
through his sufferings; and three
shivers for the student audience.

the Daily staff; old and not so an
cient, will dine "with cjuiet dig
nity." (See Emily Post.) At least,
now you have a social calendar
(omitting the usual over-the-week
end at-homes held by every worth
while fraternity group).
Proof positive that Cabbages'
taste is good, they're re-doing
'"Wings Over Europe," tonight.
May the Prime Minister's tie
keep at a discreet angle all
through his sufferings; and three
shivers for the student audience.
Concerning the recent flurry
about Stanford women taking part
in intercollegiate athletics, there is
copious information still to be dis
closed. For instance, we went over
to interview one of the teaching
staff, on the subject. It was just at
the end of a class period. His voice
boomed out:
"Oh. MUSKELUNGE, when
you fence? That's all for
today. Yes, you're FINISHED.
Ou the scales! . . . ."
We, mentioned it timidly, last
week, but nothing seems to have
been done about it. Brethren and
sistern, we must band together and
light shoulder to shoulder against
the latest fad to wind its insidious
tentacles around the fair Stanford
co-ed. (We've been reading a col
umn written in 1900.) The Demon
Bicycle must be kept from Roble
and the Row. Their souls must be
saved, even if we have to about
it.
The next step is scooters, and then,
doubtless, roller skates to match
the dancing sandals the Silly Sopho
mores are wearing on Quad. At this
time of year? Tsk!
And while we're on campus
fashions, we recommend for your
inspection the very latest in
sweaters, being paraded by
courageous frosh. The effect is
something like a bath-towel
gone wrong. Too hud modern
Pullman towels aren't larger,
so we could have another in
triguing suit on our hands.
A pastel-minded upper-classman
is going in for delicately-hued cord
uroys. He insists that white cords
are monotonous, and that Spring
has came. Oh for a fraternity house
dining room that blooms like the
flowers in May, tra-la!
Tonight, the Indians will take the
trail South again. And the boys at
home will celebrate in Western style.
The Sigma Chis have to whoop it
up (publicly) at least once a year.
The ATO's are turning rustic, and
the Daily staff; old and not so an
cient, will dine "with cjuiet dig
nity." (See Emily Post.) At least,
now you have a social calendar
(omitting the usual over-the-week
