Despite the quick sellout of the
rooters' allotment of seats in the
Pavilion for the California basket
ball contest a week from Saturday,
students who failed to pay their
fines early still have an opportunity
to witness the tussle, though from
what angle it is doubtful.
Three hundred more ducats call
ing for seats in the aisles, under
the railing in front of the regular
stands, or on the floor, will go on
sale at the B.A.C. office at 9 o'clock
today. Fans who present these tick
ets at the gate will not be admitted
to the festivities until 8 o'clock.
The pasteboards will sell for 50
cents, and only one will be flowed
each student at that price. Ho may
i purchase as many more of these im
provised seats at the general sd
! mittance price of $1.50.
