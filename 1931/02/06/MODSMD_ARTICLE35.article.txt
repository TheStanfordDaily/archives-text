ADIOS
Dear Stew:
Beginning with Monday's papi>r,
it will he your job to fill this col
umn at the top-left of the sports
page. There will he times when
you will curse the thought of the
column, but there also should he
times when you reach far a type
writer rather than a cigarette. Rut
before you tear into things, permit
a word or two of advice and what
have you from your predecessor.
In the first place, don't pay
much attention to what anyone
says about the column. There
will always he a certain number
who tell you how good or how
bad they think it is; then there
is always the .ioe who thinks
Brother Grunt/ should be given
a break, and you are the boy to
boom him.
In the second place, remember
that a surprising number of people
read the column. If you don't think
so, boot one some morning and
count the people who tell you about
i(. Then, too. the athletes will see
what you have to say—so insult
(hem when they need spurning, or
when they get fat-headed after a
rush of success to the head.
You know. Stew. I rather hate
to leave. Here it is, in the mid
flic of the hottest basketball race
these parts have ever seen, and
the Indians are right up there in
the thick of it. And after that,
the track season will be here,
and I won't even be in the in
stitution to see it. It's all a guy
can do to be calm when he
thinks of track season, too.
That U.S.C. meet will talje place
in the Stanford Stadium, and what
we should do to those boys will he '
plenty—to say nothing of what we j
will do to poor California on the
track and field. And then, of course. ;
there is the Enter-Collegiate meet !
bach Ejist, with Stanford standing
an excellent chance to come through, j
In tennis, too. we ought to
smear the Golden Bear, and if
all goes well, that will be the
fourth major sport win Stanford
will collect this season. The
baseball season is also on tiie
way, but secretly think that col
legiate baseball has it all over
any of the ancient methods of
torture. After all, it is a more
subtle form of agony.
If you want a scrap. Stew, the sit- 1
nation is all set up. There's the i
(piostjon of inter-collegiate compe
tion for women. With that brand
new gy:v,in!sium—although heaven
Knows when the Five Hundred will j
« ver raise enough money to furnish
it—affording adequate facilities, the
women may be able to secure out
side competition.
Either sports are good or bad
—and if they are good, then
there should be some incentive |
to attract people to compete. In
ter-collegiate fencing, swimming,
tennis, golf, and the like certain
ly seem innocuous enough 'for
the women, and it would hardly
st em possible that these sports
would become "highly commer
cialized."
It's a great game, Stew. We had
the football season, and the first half
of the hoop clashes. You'll have all
the rest of the sports calendar, but
i( will have to go a long way to make
up for the Big Game. High-score ,
records in football only come once
in a long, long time, and we got the
story of that one, although you may
have a new high score record set in
t rack.
Yes, (hat was an eventful Au
tumn quarter, what with the
U.S.C. disaster, the Oregon Stale
squeeze, the Washington win,
the marvelous Big Game, and
(lie downfall of Dartmouth. And
"Pop" Warner's adoption of the
shift late in the season, too. had
something of the element of
news in it. It's too bad you won't
have an opportunity to get ac
quainted with the Old Fox—he's
well worth knowing.
But football is over, and there is
plenty to talk about in basketball. |
This man llunn certainly has made
a world of difference in the Cardi
nals. and it seems unbelievable that
Stanford has a winning hoop five. To
him must go (In* lion's share of tin*
< redit for the improvement in the
locals' style of p'-f.y, along with the
work of the men on the team.
And as the last thing we have
to say—we want to pat Captain
TViik<* l{e>nolds on the back. Play
ing a new position in his senior
year, he h.is made us complete
ly forget that he ever was a
guard, and right now it is im
possible to see him at any other
position hut that which he now
holds. It takes a good man to
move from one place to another
on the court, and Mike has done
the job well.
And so, Stew, you take over the
column. Do it justice, as I know
you will. It may be lough to fill it
ti|> lale in Spring quarter, but you
< an have a merry old time for the
balance of Ibis one. If, within six
weeks, the student body has forgot
ten who I-. K., -!r. was. I'll owe you
a big debt of gratitude.
—L.K., Jr.
