# FRESHMAN NINE TO TACKLE MISSION HI IN SEASON OPENER
## 
### 
Baseball enthusiasts will have
their first opportunity of the sea
son to witness the freshman nine in
action when the yearling outfit
meets the Mission High School team
on the local diamond tomorrow at
10:30 o'clock.
Unless the Mission boys bring
down a super nine, they won't find
the frosh easy pickings. With Stan
Anderson, stellar pitcher for the
babes, displaying mid-season form,
and with John Bacon and Arthur
Hearne capable of holding down the
first bag, Wataru Sulow and A1
Peaehe vieing for second, Jo Robin
son at third, Leffel Holmes at short,
and Charles Dodge behind the
home plate, things look promising
for a smooth functioning infield.
Newton Goldman, Cal Emeis, and
James Neuman will probably fill the
outfield positions.
