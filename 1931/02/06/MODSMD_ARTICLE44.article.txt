# INDIAN NINE TO TACKLE ATHENS CLUB SATURDAY
## Caddel, Pihl Start Game; Quayle, Third Base, Is Real Threat 
### Francis Lloyd 
A highly touted and advertised
baseball team operating under the
banner of the Athens Club of San
Francisco will meet the Stanford
nine at 2:30 o'clock Saturday after
noon on the local diamond. A new
battery composed of Caddel and
Pihl will start for the Indians.
Now that the local ball players
have gotten the '"feci" of their new
park, under the tutelage of the
Keneally Seals, followers of Farm
baseball hopes should get an exer
cise in reading larger numbers on
the scoreboardâ€”in the Stanford
column.
Great things have been heard
about Bill Quayle, third baseman
for the Athens outfit and late of the
hard-hitting Oregon Aggies team.
According to reports Mr, Quayle is
just about on the verge of going to
the big leagues, which fact, if veri
fied Saturday, should make things
quite interesting for the Indians.
A1 Woodward, a new comer on
the starting line-up of the Farm
diamond artists, will play in right
field and is expected to put an extra
punch in the batting order. Harry
Plymire, who reserves one arm for
tennis and one arm for baseball, is
slated to pilch if Caddel weakens.
The starting line-ups are as fol
lows: For Stanford, Caddel, p; Pihl,
c; Cook, lb; Philippi, 2b; Dykes
Johnson, 3b; Delmas, ss; Hunken,
If; Campbell, cf; Woodward, rf.
For the Athens Club: Welch, p;
Rodgers, c; Gardner, lb; Vonah, 2b;
Quayle, 3b; Rennella, ss; Douthit,
If; Bill, cf; Starasinich, rf.
