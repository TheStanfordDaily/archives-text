# ERASTON WRESTS TENNIS CROWN FROM GLEDHILL
## Stephens Captures Fifth Position; Weesner Vanquishes Cox 
### 
Pulling the biggest upset of the j
yeai*, Ted Easton yesterday fought
his way through Keith Gledhill in 1
three brilliant sets to gain the cov
eted first place on the varsity tennis !
team. The score, 2-6, 0-3, 6-2, clear
ly shows the tremendous push with
which Easton overwhelmed the for
mer junior champion after being i
snowed under in the first set.
His powerful forehand drive and {
superb net play, working to perfec- I
tion yesterday, combined with a 1
temporarily superior service to sur- |
pass his old rival, and, while Gled- l
hill's forehand was, perhaps, a little
weaker than usual, the new first
man deserves all the credit that goes
with his title. Gledhill will now
have to defend his second position
against Harry Plymire, and, if he
successfully does so, may regain his
first place in about two weeks.
Another shift among the higher
ups occurred when Trow Stephens |
won over Phil Niederauer, 6-3, 10-8. 1
to grab the latter's new-gained fifth j
position and, incidentally, a shot at I
Joe Coughlin. In a three-set strug- j
gle Chuck Weesner managed to hold
onto his seventh place, turning back
Wilbur Cox, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2. Kelsey
Petterson failed to move up, stopped
by Bob Forbes, number eight, by a
score of 6-4, 8-6.
Among the lower ten players two I
netmen held their positions, while j
one lost. The successful defenders :
were Hubert Butler, who staved off ,
Howard Blethen 7-5, 6-0, and Bill i
Wentworth, who defeated Ray Ed- j
wards 6-2, 8-6. George Bergstrom !
won a three-set lilt, 6-2, t 4-6, 6-2, to
move into John Gantner's position.
