# NOTED PIANIST TO GIVE PERFORMANCE HERE FEBRUARY 19
## Tickets for Fourth Concert of Series on Sale at Old Union 
### 
Harold Bauer, internationally fa
mous pianist, will be heard here in
the Pavilion on Thursday, February
19, in the fourth concert of the A.S.
S.U. series.
Bauer is making his twenty-eighth
tour of the United States, having
made his debut in 1900 with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. He
has since given recitals in every
important musical center of the
country, and has played with many
famous symphony orchestras.
Henry T. Finck, late critic of the
New York Evening Post, says of
him: "One does not need to be a
musician to listen to him. He makes
the meaning of the composer so clear
that a person without the least con
ception of harmony could hear and
enjoy him. Bauer is heart and soul ;
in the piece he is rendering, and j
his masterly intellect recognizes ev
ery value of tone, phrase, or climax,
to the exclusion of all mannerism.
His playing i the absolute perfec
tion of interpretation."
Tickets for the concert, as well as
for those to be given by Mischa El
man and Paul Robeson, may be ob- 1
tained at the offices of the concert j
series in the Old Union.
