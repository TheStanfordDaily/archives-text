SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 5 (/P). â€” |
Departing radically from the trend
of colleges toward ending spring
football training, the University of ;
San Francisco today announced an j
elaborate program for both spring j
gridiron practice and games.
Jimmy Needles, head coach, said 1
the plan was a "declaration of inde- j
pehdence of eastern and middle- i
western custom dictated in those |
sections by miserable climate that |
prohibits extended spring work."
Games will be played every Sat- '
urday among teams organized with
in the student body and will be con
tinuous from early in March to the
opening of the summer vacation, i
Needles said, "Our coaching staff!
will be augmented and no student, 1
no matter how small or how little ,
experience he has had, will be re
fused a suit and attention from a
coach."
