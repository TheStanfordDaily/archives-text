# COLLEGE PRESIDENT UPHOLDS FOOTBALL
## 
### 
ROME, N.Y., Feb. 4 (/P).—The
Rev. Charles L. O'Donnell, president
of Notre Dame University, said here
tonight that football at most Ameri
can colleges did not compete with
studies and interfered only with the
three "D's"—dancing, drinking, and
dates. He decried the talk of over
emphasis.
He was speaking at the St. Aloy
sius Academy football dinner.
