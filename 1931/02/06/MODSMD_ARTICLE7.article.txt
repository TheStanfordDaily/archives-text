Constitution, involving an increase
in the number of varsity basketball

crease the polo playing time neces
sary for an award from half of all ,
matches to one-third.
The proposed amendments follow:
, Article 8, Section ~"3, part d, to
read as follows:
"Any man who competes in one- ;
third the time of all polo matches ,
shall be awarded a circle Block 'S'."
Article 8, Section 2, part c, to read
as follows:
"Any man who shall have played
a total time equal to twenty min
utes of the total games in the Cali- j
fornia basketball series, or who shall
have played one-half the time of
the remaining conference basketball
games, or who shall have played
