Arc
Welding
Diminishes the Din of Steel
Construction to a Whisper
IN Boston — Dallas —Los Angeles —ancl
in other cities, lofty buildings are going
up so quietly that the passerby all but
stops and strains an ear for the old familiar
clangor.
Silently, swiftly, rigidly, economically, arc
welding knits steel with joints as strong as
! the metal itself.
Arc welding is being used more and more
| in the fabrication of buildings and ma
j chinery, the construction of pipe lines and
j tanks, and as a repair tool of universal
| utility.
Development of General Electric arc weld
ing has largely been the work of college
trained men. Others of the college men at
General Electric are largely responsible for
the high reputation won by hundreds of
G-E products used in industry and in the
: home during the last thirty-seven years.
