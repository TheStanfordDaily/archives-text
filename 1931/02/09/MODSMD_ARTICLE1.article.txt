# INDIAN CAGERS RETURN AFTER LOSS TO U.S.C.
## Cardinals, Out Of Race, Seek More Bear Meat; Pace Broncs Next PALMER OPERATED ON 
### Stewart Crawford 
Payne Palmer, forward) on the
Stanford basketball squad, is re
covering satisfactorily from an ap
pendicitis operation performed Fri
day night in San Jose, according to
word received late last night from
the San Jose hospital. Palmer was
on his way south with the Stanford
hoopsters for the U.S.C. game when
he was taken off the train at Wat
sonville and rushed to San Jose.
Definitely eliminated from the
Coast Conference title race as a rc
? ult of the 33 to 22 loss suffered at
the hands of the Trojan five Sat
urday night, the Indian basketball
.squad of 15 is back on the Farm
today, ready to settle down in prep
aration for their final objective of
the season, a series victory from
California.
Though a pair of wins over the
Bears on the next two week-ends
would put Bunn's men in a tie for
first place on a basis of'lhe number
of games won, provided the Bruins
take one of the two Trojan-U.C.
LA. contests yet to be played, a
Conference rule gives the title, in
case of a tie, to the team which has
won the series from its rival. The
fact that Stanford has dropped two
titles to both the Bruins and U.S.C.
excludes all hope for a Cardinal
cage championship.
Trojans Improved
It was an improved Southern Cali- 1
fornia five which trounced the In
dians Saturday night, though the 11- !
point margin came as a surprise to 1
Farm sport followers. Led by the
rangy Jerry Nemer at center, who
became eligible since Stanford's !
seven-point victory over Troy, the :
U.S.C. quintet gathered 24 points in
the first half while Bunn's men could
only manage to grab seven.
With this large advantage, the vic
tors had mei'ely to pass the ball
around and take no chances, letting
the visitors force the ball .game.
OIT Night for Stars
Unable to find the basket, Mike
Reynolds and Tom Cordry were re
placed by Bill Doub and Reggie
Meade before the end of the first
half. MofTatt's shooting was also far
below his usual standard, since one ;
licld goal was the total result of his j
efforts.
Vance Fawcett's eight points, to- I
gether with his always steady floor
work, was all that saved the contest
from being a complete rout. Nemer
counted 12 markers for scoring hon
ors of the evening.
Santa Clara Next
The immediate objective of Coach j
>unn and his basketeers when they
>cgm practice today will be to win
Ihe last of the non - conference j
. ames, scheduled for tomorrow night |
ja the Pavilion with the strong Santa
C !ara five. The Broncos have
dropped only one game this s; i. on,
;:nd are classed as easily the best
college team in California.
Among other notches carved in
their basketball gun is one for liie
U; of S.F. quintet, which downed the j
Cardinals early in the season.
After a week-end without a game,
the freshman hoopsters take on the
Santa Clara yearlings in a prelimi
nary to tho varsity contest. The
babes' game with the Mission Colts ,
will start at 6:30 o'clock, and Bunn's
youngsters have a good chance to
beat the visitors. The grays lost to
the yearlings, 32-1.9, Saturday after- i
noon, and the Colts, in spite of their
good record, may take a fall.
