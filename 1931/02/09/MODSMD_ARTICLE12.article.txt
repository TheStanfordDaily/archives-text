# B.A.C. TO FREE SELF OF DEBT IN FIVE YEARS
## Department Is Retrenching By Cutting Down Expenditures 
### 
Stanford's Board of Athletic Con-
I trol will be out of debt in four or
| five years, Alfred R. Masters, gener
;al manager, declared yesterday in
j answer to one of several questions
: raised in an editorial printed in Fri
j day's Daily.
"We are retrenching," Masters
; said, "cutting down expenses. If
i present receipts continue, we will
i be able to pay ofT our $564,000 debt
I —probably not in one or two years,
I but certainly in four or five."
To Repair Stadium
Ho added that replacing the stairs
i in the Stadium, to be undertaken
1 this year, would entail a consider
able expenditure, as would replac
j ing the Stadium seats, a project
| which will be necessary within a
i year or two.
Masters refused to be quoted on
1 the effect of the restriction of the
: Lower Division upon athletics or
upon the allegation that poorer ath
letic material than was expected is
I being obtained from the junior col
; leges. Likewise, the consequences of
j a reduction in the quality of ma
, terial upon gate receipt's drew no
' comment.
No More Dormitories
The B.A.C. has no intention of
I building any further dormitories,
I Masters said.
The problem of allotment of tick
i cts to athletic events, for some time
; a thorn in the side of alumni, stu
dents, and general public alike, is
j being considered by the B.A.C. "It
j is impossible ever to have an en-
I tirely equitable allotment of tick
! ets," Masters declared, "but the
, board is working on the situation
now."
