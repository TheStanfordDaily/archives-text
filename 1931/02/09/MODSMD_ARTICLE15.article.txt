# Play Repeats Success In Second Performance
## 
### NINI JAGO 
Repetition of "Wings Over Eu
rope" last Friday night again proved
to an enthusiastic audience that
Harold Helvenston's production of
this gripping play is one of the best
ever to have been seen on this cam
pus.
Extra credit is due to Helvenston
and his excellent cast for their un
deniable success, in view of the dif
ficulty in producing such a play as
Robert Nichols and Maurice Browne
have written. For "Wings Over Eu
rope," aside from its strange story,
presents many problems in its stag
ing.
All three acts are laid in Number
10 Downing Street. Practically ev
ery scene sees 12 or more men
grouped around a large table. The
difficulty in staging such a scene ef
fectively and in presenting 12 dis
tinct characterizations strikingly is
enormous. And yet Helvenston and

i his cast succecded in overcoming
these difficulties in an entirely pro
fessional manner, giving a perform- v
ance worthy of New York itself.
To James Lyons as Francis Light
foot, the young scientific genius, and
Vallejo Canter as Evelyn Arthur,
secretary of foreign affairs, go the
histrionic honors. Both Lyons and
j Canter, the one in the role of a
highly strung physicist, the other as
' the calm, cold diplomat, gave power
! ful and real performances. Scarcely
a fiaw could be # found in their re
markable presentations.
Irving Rosenblatt as the Prime
Minister did good work also. How
| ever, he is capable of more variety
] and color than he exhibited in his
! i6le. Henry Cross, William Lyons,
! and Milton Hand were perhaps the
! most outstanding of the cabinet min
! inters. But when eleven equally fine
| characterizations* aVÂ«, giveji. such a
selection is uiYifrrn
