### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (A*). The
Navy Department today called oft
the court martial of Major General
Smedley D. Butler and issued a for
mal reprimand instead.
This action was taken by Secre
tary Adams after receipt of a letter
from the outspoken Marine officer
explaining his remarks about Pre
mier Mussolini in a recent speech at
Philadelphia.
Butler said he understood his
speech was to be confidential. Ho
added he regretted the incident "and
the fact that my indiscreet remarks
have caused cmbarrasrnent. to the
government."
Italy Closes Incident
Indications were the reprimand by
the Navy Department would not be
questioned in any way by the em
basy, which has considered the inci
dent closed so far as the Italian gov
ernment was concerned. The em
bassy first learned of the Navy De
partment's action through the Asso
ciated Press.
Text of Reprimand
In a letter signed and dispatched
to General Butler today by Secre
tary Adams, it was said the Navy
Department could not "express too
clearly its disapproval of the conduct
of any officer of the naval establish
ment in making remarks which tend
to embarrass the international rela
tions of the government."
"Such action on the part of an
officer of your rank and length of
service," Adams wrote, "merits and
receives the unqualified condemna
tion of the Navy Department, and
for their utterance, which you admit,
you are hereby reprimanded."
The Navy Secretary said, how
ever, that in view of the "letter ex
pressing regret" and "your long rec
ord of brilliant service," the general
court martial would be abandoned.
