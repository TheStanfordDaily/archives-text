# OFFICIALS TO PASS ON TYPE OF SIGNAL ORDERED FOR DRIVE
## 
### 
The question of authorizing the
erection at the intersection of Palm
Drive and El Camino Real of the
type of traffic control signal •• ai
reay ordered by the University is
expected t.o come up for settlement
in the near future before the Santa
Clara Board of Supervisors.
The device which the University
proposes to erect is the three-light
automatically controlled signal with
warning lights on the highway about
ten feet from ihc intersection. The
point of discussion is that ihc plan
differs in several respects from the
standard specifications required i»y
Ihe state highway commission.
If the resolution is adopted by
the supervisors, early erection <>f
the signals at the highway crossing
is contemplated.
