# ANOTHER BIRTHDAY
## 
### 
Once more The Daily lias changed hands and had a
birthday. Today's issue marks Ihe beginning of Volume 7!).
'i lie press ran last night jusl the same as il did last week
and as il will continue lo run, in all probability, until the 72
issues thai will compose Volume 7!) will have been pub-
This process of transition from Volume 78 to has
been an easy one. dale Wallace, retiring editor, did a good
job during his term as head man around The Daily ollice.
He developed an cMicicnl staff organization and did much
lo improve cHinpus news coverage. In addition, he pursued
vigorously, on occasion, editorial policies which had as
their ultimate aim a better Stanford.
The Daily is still strong for enforcement, and stricl en
forcement, of the Honor ('.ode. Honor, as the basis of the
I 'diversity's academic and student life, is something Stan
lord men and women are happy to have and, in most cases,
are glad to maintain. Rut, operating as il does under a
competitive grading system and in view of the fad that
no matter how selective may be the student body there
ere apt to be in il a few "punks" who will cheat, Stanford
of necessity has the Honor ('.ode. Along with the Honor
('.ode there are instruments for enforcement. Success of
the ('.ode and the continuance of honor as an attribute of
Stanford depend on the stricl observance of Hie ('ode by
"students and enforcement of il by the control bodies sel up
for that purpose.
The Daily likewise is still in favor of extending the
student health service to the point where every student
will be assured of 21-hour-a-dav care for all minor ills and
injuries. If funds are not now available for such an exten
sion and if present resources cannot be rebudgeled lo pro
vide for the added service, every effort should be made lo
secure the moneys needed.
And finally The Daily is still in favor of Ihe University's
plan for the ultimate housing of campus social fraternities.
As originally worked out by Stanford and as put into prac
tice al Duke University, Ihe plan seems feasible and far
superior lo Ihe present scattered arrangement of living
groups.
In ils policy. Volume 7!) will remember Ihe words of a
former Daily editor: "Let well enough alone, but when
things aren't well enough well!"
