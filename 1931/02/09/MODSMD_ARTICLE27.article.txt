Tlinl gTorious creature, the American college girl, has
fdvanced another notch in her battle for equality by scor
ing I<i intercollegiate vietoi'ies over mere man, one by
default.
At Memphis, Tcnn., a Presbyterian minister who had
been ([noted as saying that Southwestern 1 niversity eo-eds
wore "indecent" costumes at a dunce, beat a hasty retreat
; s the girls demanded that he make a public apology for
the statement. According to the clergyman, the co-eds had
appeared at a dance clad in pajamas, shorts, and veils.
Now he says that he merely described the costumes, but
did not characterize them as indecent.
The trustees of four eastern universities, however, did
not even dare to cross militant college womanhood. Very
gracefully Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, and Yale de
clined gifts of $2r>,()()0 bequeathed to each of them by the
late Albert K. Pillsbury with the stipulation in his will that
the bequests be used to "develop sound public opinion and
action" against the feminist movement.
The clergyman was made to see the error of his way;
the college officials have apparently seen the handwriting
on the wall. With two such stirring triumphs as this to the
co-eds' credit, who would dare intimate that the college
girls are not yet ready for intercollegiate athletic compe
tition among themselves?
