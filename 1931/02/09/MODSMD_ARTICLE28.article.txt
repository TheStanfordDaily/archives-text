During the imminent season of midquarter examina
tions, Stanford students may feel a bit envious toward the
men who will study under Yale's revised curricular plan,
to go into effect next year, t'nder the new scheme, every
course will run for a whole year, and all examinations will
be discarded save the final and comprehensive ones, cov
ering the year's work in each subject.
A further difference from the Stanford system, by which
one accumulates 1<X() units by many courses mostly of live
units or less, is that Yale students beginning next fall will
be required to take only 20 courses during their four under
graduate years.
