# BISHOP CANNON RESUMES WORK
## Prohibition Leader Freed Of Minister's Charge 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (JP). -
Cleared of charges brought against
him by four ministers of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church, South. Bish
op James Cannon, Jr., prepared to
day to resume his church duties as
soon as his health permits.
The militant prohibition leader
spent the Sabbath today in Sibley
Hospital contemplating the decision
of 12 clergymen last night that the
charges filed against him by the four
ministers did not have sufficient
weight to justify a trial before the
1934 general conference of the
church.
Second Triumph
It was the second time within a
jear that Bishop Cannon has
emerged triumphant from accusa
tions emanating from within his own
church. The first time was at the
general conference last year in Dal
las when he was accused of gam
bling in stocks.
The decision last night was
reached after a five-day investiga
tion behind the locked and guarded
doors of the Mount Vernon Place
Church.
Grave Charges
Because of the gravity of the
charges, Bishop W. N. Ainsworth, of
Birmingham, Ala., who presided,
ruled that the accused churchman
should have the opportunity of
cross-examining witnesses and pre
senting such defense as he desired.
Had the committee found the
charges to be well founded, Bishop
Cannon would have been suspended
from all active duty for three years
before he could have been brought
to trial.
After the hearings ended late last
night Bishop Cannon called the As
sociated Press and said he "had no
statement to make now on any sub
ject." Members of the committee
;md the four men who had brought
the charges also refused any state
ment.
