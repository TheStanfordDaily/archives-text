MOTHER'S CRY—At the New Stan-
ford Theater

"Mother's Cry" is one of those
movies that might appeal to women,
and that doesn't mean those of col
lege age, either. As far as movies
go, it's good. The story is rather in
teresting, the actors handle their
roles well.
The trouble is that mother-love,
sell - sacrifice, ruined little sisters,
the good son and pillar of his moth
er's old age, to say nothing of the
murderous black sheep, do not carry
the coicvntion of the gay nineties.
As such a production, "Mother's
Cry" is excellently done, but is
hardly likely to be appreciated.
Dorothy Peterson and Sidney
Blackmer as the mother and prodi
gal son, respectively, are good ac
tors and do as well as such a plot
allows.

FAMOUS PLAYS OF TODAY. By
Victor Gollancz. $3.50 (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop)

This is an omnibus volume, some
what too violently named, contain
ing some good plays, some bad ones:
Many Waters, a sin of cold tea;
Young Woodley, pathetic encounter
with a poetic adolescent in an Eng
lish school; the widely known Jour
ney's End; The Lady with the Lamp,
whose title and concern—Florence

j Nightingale—interested us not; Such
Men Are Dangerous, weak stuff, u !
' typical Ashley Dukian adaptation;
Mis. Moonlight, which entertains 1
1 audiences at Charles Hopkins' tiny
; New York theater now.
The volume is varied, certainly
! worth looking over for some ii not j
i all of the plays. Several of them
i make a first appearance in the col- ,
, lection.

OH, FOR A MAN —At the Varsity
Theater

As Carlotla Mansur, opera star j
! bubbling over with inconsistent lem- j
perament, Jcanette Mac Donald finds I
I "life" when Reginald Denny as Bar
ney McGann climbs in her window, j
That her conception of "life" changed \
with every dramatic idea that en
tered her head was not exactly Bar
ney's fault, although he helped it
along considerably.
Resulting situations are decidedly i
amusing, even though you groan to i
save your self-respect. When there
is singing, it's meant to be funny, j
In fact, it's the kind of picture thai j
you enjoy in a calm sort of way— |
| mediocre and light, but from one j
point of view satisfying—.Jeanette
Mac Donald never sings out of place
and time, and only occasionally out
of tune.
—J. N. i
