# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Still feeling game, but not so sport
ing, this morning. Now we know that
Southern Sunshine is bad for ath
letes. At least, the boys went down
and tried hard. We've never lost a
basketball game by default.
Meanwhile, baseball is an increas
ing source of editorial joy. We won a
game without trying too hard, Sat
urday, from the Athens Club. It is
even rumored that a baseball man
breaks training rules, every now and
then, which doesn't click with all the
things the Sunday School teacher
taught us. If you can stay out boom
ing till 4:30 o'clock in the morning,
and then win a game practically
single-handed, what could you do if
you just didn't come home at all?
Adding to the oddities of the
hawl-out, this quarter, we have
a certain Alpha () who is listed
as a member of Alpha Tau
Omega, but still has the right
post-box number. Maybe the
ATO's are simply boasting. At
any rate, she must enjoy adver
tisements sent through the mail
â€”"Gents' cleaning and pressing,
'() cents, while you wait."
Looks very much as if we weren't

(going to do much boating on Lagu
j nita this spring unless someone gets
i Jupiter Pluvius so excited that he
j lets loose a couple of cloudbursts.
We will miss the 'annual tadpole
' crop, otherwise.
And so, the annual ping-pong
| war, never quite entirely over with,
'will start again. Back-gammon
; threatens competition, though. It's a
i more vigorous-sounding intramural
S sport, and not quite so oriental,
i Maybe our friends the Dekes could
: win a tilt or so, to revenge them
; selves for vulgar losses suffered so
! far this yeai\
Ilad you all noticed (ha< our
Acting-President was away on
business, and that we were be
ing honored by the government
of an Acting-President for an
Acting-President for the titular
; President of the University?
Now, if something would only
have happened to the Acting-
Acting prexy's Nevada mining
stock, so that he'd have had to
make a hurried trip away, we'd
have had an Acting-Acting
A-a-aa But we're supposed
t to have student government .. .
