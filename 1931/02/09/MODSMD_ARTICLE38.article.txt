Many persons were always won
dering why "Betty Co-ed's dress was
black for old Purdue." The secret is
out. Her dress is black for the men
of Purdue because they outnumber
the women seven to one.
Stanford's ratio of six (o one
was thought to fie a world-wide
record, but the wreath of sym
pathy must needs move from the
I arm to the men of Purdue.
The University of Kansas feels that
if women wish to be modern in all
things, they should adopt the system
of "dutch dates," thus proving their
equality with men.
The first rule in modern life
is: "Oct what you can get." The
co-eds are highly modern at
present.
It is reported from the University
of McGill that at one American col
lege all co-eds. caught "necking"
have their names read at an open
student assembly.
Publicity usually drives things
into the open, but such an
nouncements will drive campus
lovers far away into hidden re
treats.

.After being bombarded with ripe
| grapefruit by irate Harvard men at
; a public theatre appearance, Rudy
Vallee claimed to the press thai, radio
i was his true medium of expression.
Rudy is correct from two view
points. He can avoid missiles by
speaking over the radio; and we
can avoid him by a simple turn
of a dial when he uses the
ether waves.
The president of the University of
| Minnesota claims that the present
! four-year college course will soon
be supplemented by a variable two
i to ten-year course depending«on the
student's ability and money.
This says nothing of his endurance,
will power, eyesight, and capacity*for
I storing up facts. Then also one must
1 consider the individual's ability to
drink black coffee, smoke cigarettes,
and, harder than all, listen to apple
i polishing co-eds for 10 years.
Eighty per cent of Wells College
co-eds are planning to marry. No
longer do women HOPE to marry.
' They merely set about in
manner and PLAN to accomplish
| what their sisters of yesterday hoped
I to do.
