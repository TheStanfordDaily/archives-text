# "FAMILY GAZETTE" IS CHAPPIE'S NEXT TITLE
## 
### 
"The Family Gazette!"
Chaparral's nÂ§xt issue, which will
appear Thursday, will bear that
title and will be a riotous duplicate
of the crude journals of the 19th
century, according to Burnell Gould,
editor.
Filled with antiquated cuts, an
cient types, and redundant articles,
the issue will carry the old style
motif even into the advertising
pages.
Articles on "The Saloon Must Go,"
"The American Frat," "The Fire
wagon," and "New Styles" will
adorn the pages, liberally illus
trated with terrible, old pictures.
Paul Lorton, Don Cameron, Dolph
Winebrenner, and Burnell Gould
are the major contributors to the
issue.
