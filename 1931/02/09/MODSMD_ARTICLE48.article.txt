Dear Len:
Taking over this left-handed
column on the sports page is
going to he tough, Len, not just
because it must he filled faith
fully, day after day. As you
said in your letter, sports on
the Farm, especially with a bas
ketball team that has broken
California's long supremacy on
the court, another 1.C.4-A.
championship track squad in
prospect; tennis, golf, and swim
ming talent worthy of a column
in any newspaper, will furnish
plenty to write about. That's
not the point, Len.
You know, ihe tradition on the
Daily is to make each succeeding
volume better than its predecessor,
and that means to improve what
goes into its columns, for after all
Ihe news, ihe quality of its pre
sentation, IS the newspaper. That's
where it's going to be tough, keeping
this column where the signature of
L.K.,Jr. has placed it in the eyes
of the breakfast table fans.
And that Big Game issue; few
of them realize that you put out
that paper, one of the best
sports sheets this campus has
seen in a long time, practically
unaided. The Big Meet issue
will he coming along this spring,
and it's going to take a lot of
work to put that edition where
it can compare with yours.
A lot has happened around here
since you wrote that letter, Len,
which just shows you what you're
missing. That hottest of all Confer
ence basketball races you men
tioned, plenty has happened to that.
Remember you said that the Golden
Bear had a habit of winning cage
games in dear old Harmon Gymna
sium, and that they would take a
couple from U.C.L.A. over the
week-end. That's just the trouble,
Len, they did. Folks hereabouts
vyoke up Saturday morning to read
in Ihe papers that all four teams
were tied for the lead, or the base
ment, of the Conference.
Wonder what the trouble was
with the Indians down there at
Los Angeles Saturday night.
Maybe this newly eligible cen
ter for the Trojans by the name
of Jerry Neiner is the answer.
He scored 10 paints for S.C.,
just about the margin by which
we were defeated. Looks like
the team was having an off
night.
Remember that Captain Mike
Reynolds gathered 12 points when
the Redshirt five captured Troy up
here in the Pavilion? He didn't take
any Saturday night, and Moffatt
only scored 2. Those 12 that "Fancy"
Phil got ag:iir.st U.C.LA. last week
would have looked good down there.
Vance Fawcett was the high-point
man for the Indians with 8. Win
ning or losing, at home or on a
foreign court, "Dazzy" is always
the same. You'll probably agree,
Len, that it will be a long time
before Stanford finds a better bas
ketball player.
It's too bad you couldn't stay
to see out the finish of the court
season. It's been a successful
one, even though the Cardinals
are definitely out of the Con
ference race. To Coach John
Bunn goes the credit for the
success, which came in the form
of a victory over the Bears up
at Oakland that night. Perhaps
he can add tc the wonders he
has already accomplished, by
taking a series from the Blue
and Gold. If so. Len, it's a cinch
that your care-worn fingers will
he itching to get at a typewriter
again and hammer out another
"slants." —Crawford.

Vance Fawcett was the high-point
man for the Indians with 8. Win
ning or losing, at home or on a
foreign court, "Dazzy" is always
the same. You'll probably agree,
Len, that it will be a long time
before Stanford finds a better bas
ketball player.
It's too bad you couldn't stay
to see out the finish of the court
season. It's been a successful
one, even though the Cardinals
are definitely out of the Con
ference race. To Coach John
Bunn goes the credit for the
success, which came in the form
of a victory over the Bears up
at Oakland that night. Perhaps
he can add tc the wonders he
has already accomplished, by
taking a series from the Blue
and Gold. If so. Len, it's a cinch
that your care-worn fingers will
he itching to get at a typewriter
again and hammer out another
"slants." —Crawford.
Dear Len:
Taking over this left-handed
column on the sports page is
going to he tough, Len, not just
because it must he filled faith
fully, day after day. As you
said in your letter, sports on
the Farm, especially with a bas
ketball team that has broken
California's long supremacy on
the court, another 1.C.4-A.
championship track squad in
prospect; tennis, golf, and swim
ming talent worthy of a column
in any newspaper, will furnish
plenty to write about. That's
not the point, Len.
You know, ihe tradition on the
Daily is to make each succeeding
volume better than its predecessor,
and that means to improve what
goes into its columns, for after all
Ihe news, ihe quality of its pre
sentation, IS the newspaper. That's
where it's going to be tough, keeping
this column where the signature of
L.K.,Jr. has placed it in the eyes
of the breakfast table fans.
And that Big Game issue; few
of them realize that you put out
that paper, one of the best
sports sheets this campus has
seen in a long time, practically
unaided. The Big Meet issue
will he coming along this spring,
and it's going to take a lot of
work to put that edition where
it can compare with yours.
A lot has happened around here
since you wrote that letter, Len,
which just shows you what you're
missing. That hottest of all Confer
ence basketball races you men
tioned, plenty has happened to that.
Remember you said that the Golden
Bear had a habit of winning cage
games in dear old Harmon Gymna
sium, and that they would take a
couple from U.C.L.A. over the
week-end. That's just the trouble,
Len, they did. Folks hereabouts
vyoke up Saturday morning to read
in Ihe papers that all four teams
were tied for the lead, or the base
ment, of the Conference.
Wonder what the trouble was
with the Indians down there at
Los Angeles Saturday night.
Maybe this newly eligible cen
ter for the Trojans by the name
of Jerry Neiner is the answer.
He scored 10 paints for S.C.,
just about the margin by which
we were defeated. Looks like
the team was having an off
night.
Remember that Captain Mike
Reynolds gathered 12 points when
the Redshirt five captured Troy up
here in the Pavilion? He didn't take
any Saturday night, and Moffatt
only scored 2. Those 12 that "Fancy"
Phil got ag:iir.st U.C.LA. last week
would have looked good down there.
