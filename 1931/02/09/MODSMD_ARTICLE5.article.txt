# FINAL DRIVE FOR GYM FUND BRINGS IN $404
## 
### 
As a result of the concentrated
efforts made last week by the Gym
Fund Committee, and the repre
sentatives in the living groups, a
total of $404.24 has been received,
and $89.11 is still to be turned in,
according to Gertrude Laidlaw.
The generous response with which
the solicitors were met has insured
at least the necessities of the fur
nishings which will be needed for
the new Women's Gym, Miss Laid-
law states.
