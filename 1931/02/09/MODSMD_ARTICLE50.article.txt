# Varsity Nine Defeats Athens Tossers, 4 To 2
## JOHNSON ASSUMES MOUND IN FOURTH TO STOP CLUBMEN Indians Take Lead In 5th With Three-Run Rally; Philippi Stars 
### Francis Lloyd 
Six goose eggs all hanging in a
row on the scoreboard after Dan
J Johnson got on the mound for Stan
ford, some indiscriminate hitting,
| and a fancy exhibition at the key
; stone sack by Vince Philippi tell
I the story of the Indians' victory
over the Athens Club Saturday by
\ a 4-2 margin.
During the six frames in which
Dan Johnson was working at the
j slab for the Redshirts the Athens
Club collected six strikeouts, only
two singles, and nary a visitor be
came acquainted with the beauties
of third, base. The Athens ball
hawks got one run from each of the
other two Indian hurlers—Vard*
j Loomis and Harry Plymire.
Rally Cut Short
i Five chances, and all of them
! tough, were chalked up for Vince
Philippi, and not a solitary error to
I blemish his sterling performance
: was recorded against him. A bud
| ding rally in the second inning was
! cut short when, with two of his
| mates on the paths, the Athens
pitcher hit into a double play, Del
| mas to Philippi to Cook.
I After being down 2-1 at the be
| ginning of the fifth, Stanford filled
! the bags on two singles by the
i Johnsons—Dan and Dykes—Cook
I being hit by a pitched ball.
Philippi Scores Two
Philippi then brought in two runs
[ with a long fly to center, Hunken
! walked, and another run crossed
the pan v /hen Delmas rapped out a
sharp single to deep short, putting
the Indians in the lead, 4-2.
Cook- was the heavy hitter for the
Indians, scoring two runs and bat
ting .500. Pihl got the only extra
base blow for the Farm nine when
he hit a liner over the hot corner
in the third stanza, but he was left
stranded on the paths.
Captain Hunken starred in the
outfield when he gathered in three
flies in left field, while Campbell in
the central garden spot also was re- '
sposible for three put-outs. Wood
, worth, Stine, and Riede shared the !
right field berth for the Indians.

Stanford's football coach, Fielding 11. Yost, was to go to Michigan, with
a salary "somewhat better than $2,500."

; stone sack by Vince Philippi tell
I the story of the Indians' victory
over the Athens Club Saturday by
\ a 4-2 margin.
During the six frames in which
Dan Johnson was working at the
j slab for the Redshirts the Athens
Club collected six strikeouts, only
two singles, and nary a visitor be
came acquainted with the beauties
of third, base. The Athens ball
hawks got one run from each of the
other two Indian hurlers—Vard*
j Loomis and Harry Plymire.
Rally Cut Short
i Five chances, and all of them
! tough, were chalked up for Vince
Philippi, and not a solitary error to
I blemish his sterling performance
: was recorded against him. A bud
| ding rally in the second inning was
! cut short when, with two of his
| mates on the paths, the Athens
pitcher hit into a double play, Del
| mas to Philippi to Cook.
I After being down 2-1 at the be
| ginning of the fifth, Stanford filled
! the bags on two singles by the
i Johnsons—Dan and Dykes—Cook
I being hit by a pitched ball.
Philippi Scores Two
Philippi then brought in two runs
[ with a long fly to center, Hunken
! walked, and another run crossed
the pan v /hen Delmas rapped out a
sharp single to deep short, putting
the Indians in the lead, 4-2.
Cook- was the heavy hitter for the
Indians, scoring two runs and bat
ting .500. Pihl got the only extra
base blow for the Farm nine when
he hit a liner over the hot corner
in the third stanza, but he was left
stranded on the paths.
Captain Hunken starred in the
outfield when he gathered in three
flies in left field, while Campbell in
the central garden spot also was re- '
sposible for three put-outs. Wood
, worth, Stine, and Riede shared the !
right field berth for the Indians.

! defeat to Schmidt.


Another important event 3ft years ago was the announcement that
Stanford's football coach, Fielding 11. Yost, was to go to Michigan, with
a salary "somewhat better than $2,500."
Six goose eggs all hanging in a
row on the scoreboard after Dan
J Johnson got on the mound for Stan
ford, some indiscriminate hitting,
| and a fancy exhibition at the key
; stone sack by Vince Philippi tell
I the story of the Indians' victory
over the Athens Club Saturday by
\ a 4-2 margin.
During the six frames in which
Dan Johnson was working at the
j slab for the Redshirts the Athens
Club collected six strikeouts, only
two singles, and nary a visitor be
came acquainted with the beauties
of third, base. The Athens ball
hawks got one run from each of the
other two Indian hurlers—Vard*
j Loomis and Harry Plymire.
Rally Cut Short
i Five chances, and all of them
! tough, were chalked up for Vince
Philippi, and not a solitary error to
I blemish his sterling performance
: was recorded against him. A bud
| ding rally in the second inning was
! cut short when, with two of his
| mates on the paths, the Athens
pitcher hit into a double play, Del
| mas to Philippi to Cook.
I After being down 2-1 at the be
| ginning of the fifth, Stanford filled
! the bags on two singles by the
i Johnsons—Dan and Dykes—Cook
I being hit by a pitched ball.
Philippi Scores Two
Philippi then brought in two runs
[ with a long fly to center, Hunken
! walked, and another run crossed
the pan v /hen Delmas rapped out a
sharp single to deep short, putting
the Indians in the lead, 4-2.
Cook- was the heavy hitter for the
Indians, scoring two runs and bat
ting .500. Pihl got the only extra
base blow for the Farm nine when
he hit a liner over the hot corner
in the third stanza, but he was left
stranded on the paths.
Captain Hunken starred in the
outfield when he gathered in three
flies in left field, while Campbell in
the central garden spot also was re- '
sposible for three put-outs. Wood
, worth, Stine, and Riede shared the !
right field berth for the Indians.
