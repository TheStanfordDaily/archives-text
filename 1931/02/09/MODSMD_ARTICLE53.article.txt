at San Francisco.
The Olympic Club took first hon
ors, with a score of 6-3 over Stan

Indians defeated California, 7-2.
Stanford was represented by
Leonard Pockman, Tom Fockman,
and Jim Reed. L. Pockman was de
feated only by Ferard Leicestei - , of
the Olympic Club, in a bout that
went to four touches each, with the
ninth and deciding touch by Leices
ter.
Pockman was high point man for
Slanford, taking 5 out of 6 bouts, and
qualified himself for the finals in
the open individual saber champion
ship.
That the scores were not entirely
indicative of Stanford's ability is
shown by the fact that five of the
nine bouts lost went to four touches
each and were decided by the ninth
and final touch.

Co-eds at Ihe University of De
troit have been forbidden to con
verse with the male students at any
time on the campus.
