# ACTION ON CODE NOT YET TAKEN
## Examination Committee To Submit Result 
### 
Returning from Washington Sat
urday after a two weeks' absence
from the campus, Acting-President
Robert E. Swain announced Satur
day afternoon that the report of the
Committee on Schedule and Exam
inations, dealing with the Honor
Code, had not yet been submitted
to him, but that he would give it
attention immediatly upon its pre
sentation.
It is expected that the report will
contain recommendations concern
ing the Honor Code enforcement
proposals of the Executive Commit
tee of the A.S.S.U., made nearly
three weeks ago and sent to the
Administration, which handed them
down to the Committee on Schedule
and Examinations for study.
Ex Committee Proposals
These proposals included enabling
students to have proctors in the
examination room if they so desire;
provision whereby papers would not
be corrected which did not bear a
signed statement of honorable con
duct; calling attention of students
by instructors to existence of the
Honor Code; and posting of pla
cards or notices in examination
rooms stating principles of the Code.
Since no action had been taken
on the proposals last Tuesday, the
Ex Committee passed a resolution
requesting faculty members to put
into effect, without official adminis
tration endorsement, the last two
provisions included in the list sent
to the Administration, in time for
mid-quarter examinations.
The Committee on Schedule and
Examinations is composed of Pro
fessors G. E. Osborne, Law Depart
ment; J. P. Mitchell, Chemistry De
partment; A. S. Miles, Aeronautic
Engineering Department; C. P.
Stone, Psychology Department; and
F. E. Terman, Department of Elec
trical Engineering.
