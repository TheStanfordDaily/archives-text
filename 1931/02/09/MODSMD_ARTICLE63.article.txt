# FAMOUS PIANIST ONCE VIOLINIST
## Paderewski Advised Bauer To Take Up Piano 
### 
Harold Bauer, famous pianist who
will be heard here in the Pavilion
on February 19 in the fourth con
cert of the A.S.S.U. series, began his
career as a violinist.
He was born in England of a well
known musical family, and in his
youth attracted wide attention by
his violin playing. However, Pade
rewski heard him accompany a sing
er one day and persuaded him that
his real talent was for the piano.
After a period of study in Paris,
for many years his home, Bauer s
debut was made, and was followed
by tours of every section of Europe.
In 1900 he gave his first concert in
the United States with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, and has since
become an American citizen with
his home in New York. This present
season marks his twenty-eighth
tour of the country.
The remaining concert of the A.S.
SU. series is to be given by Paul
Robeson, celebrated negro baritone.
Besides this, the concert series ollice
has arranged for a concert to be
given by Mischa Elman which will
take place in the beginning of April.
Tickets for both concerts may be
procured at the office of the series
in the Old Union.
