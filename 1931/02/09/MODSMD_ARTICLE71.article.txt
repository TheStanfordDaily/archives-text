# DRIFTING FISHERMEN RESCUED FROM ICE BY PATROL CUTTER
## 
### 
BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. 8. (/Pi -- A
score of fishermen were safe tonight
after two days and a night of cold,
exposure, and hunger on a drifting
ice floe in the wind-swept waters of
Lake Erie.
For nearly 36 hours these men
faced death in the darkness of a
storm-lashed lake, death from freez
ing, drowning, exhaustionâ€”before
an airplane circling 100 feet above
the ice and open channels of the
lake brought them their first mes
sage of hope. The plane guided a
Coast Guard boat to the floe and
the men were brought back to shore
tonight.
Swooping low. the airplane, char
tered by the Courier Express, a
Buffalo newspaper, dropped notes to
the ice. Then out from the underside
of the plane dropped a huge vacuum
container, a parachute blossomed,
and a can of hot coffee settled to
the ice.
The plane sped back to shore.
More notes were dropped to Coast
Guard patrols, and a boat put out
to begin the long battle through
two miles of slush ice, then across
a mile and a half of open water to
the floe on which the men were
marooned.

The favorite sport at Cambridge
I and Oxford is cricket.
