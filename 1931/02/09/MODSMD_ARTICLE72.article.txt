# KING GUARANTEES POPULAR ELECTIONS TO SPANISH PEOPLE
## 
### 
MADRID, Feb. 8. UP)â€”After more
than seven years of dictatorship
constitutional guarantees were re
stored 1o Spanish subjects today by
a royal proclamation which calls for
parliamentary elections in March.
The guarantees and parliamentary
elections were suspended by the
dictatorship of the late Miguel
Primo de Rivera September 23, 1923.
Despite the dictator's frequent
promises to return Spain to a con
stitutional government, this was not
done until today.
General Damasco Berenguer, who
succeeded Primo de Rivera as dic
tator more than a year ago, had
continued the suspension during the
past year, which saw a" series of
labor, political, and radical disturb
ances in the country.
Press censorship will not be raised
officially until tomorrow because
the law forbids Sunday newspaper
work. Political ch'cles say the con
stitutional guarantees will be en
dorsed by the government providing
no attempts are made to disturb the
public peace. Should such disorders
develop the suspension again would
be announced.
