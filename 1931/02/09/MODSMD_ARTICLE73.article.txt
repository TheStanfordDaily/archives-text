# GANDHI REJECTS BRITAIN'S OFFER
## Irwin Asks Investigation Of Cruelty Reports 
### 
ALLAHABAD, India, Feb. 8. (/P)
â€”A deep gloom encircled the head
quarters of (he National Congress
here today as a result of the reply
of Viceroy Lord Irwin to the recent
letter of Mahatma Gandhi asking an
investigation into what the Nation
alist leader termed gross cruelty
and repression by police in subdu
ing those engaged in the present
liberation movement.
Whatever faint hope there might
have been for acceptance of Ram
say Mac Donald's proposal for quali
fied Indian home rule is regarded
now as gone forever.
Members of the working commit
tee of Congress, including Gandhi,
profess to see in the viceroy's reply
no evidence the government really
desires to make peace with the
Congress except on its own arbi
trary terms. The message of the
viceroy is termed "curt and coldly
official."
The hopelessness of the situation
: may be guaged from the fact that
many members of the working com
mittee in conversation with the As
sociated Press correspondent frankly
said they expect to be back in jail
within a fortnight.
Gandhi himself is described as
painfully disappointed and disillu
sioned by the viceroy's letter. The
text of the correspondence between
the Nationalist leader and the vice
roy will be released in a few days.
But because of the viceroy's blunt
communication all hopes for peace
have been abandoned by Congress
leaders.
