# WORK ON GATE STARTED AFTER POSTPONEMENTS
## Delays Caused By Failure To Decide On Site; New Quarry Sought 
### 
Construction work on the long
awaited gateway to the University
at the end of Palm Drive is finally
under way.
The \york has been delayed for
some time by disagreements and
unavoidable difficulties. Consider
able disagreement as to the site and
dimensions of the structure were
met with and the failure of the
quarry from which it was expected
the sandstone would be obtained
made further delay unavoidable. It
was necessary to locate a new
quarry near San Jose.
Templates Located
The work began Friday morning
with an engineer and an attendant
corps of carpenters locating the
templates and forms for the concrete
base of the new structure. Excava
tions for the foundations which
were scheduled for Saturday will
not be started until today.
The' gate is set back approxi
mately 100 feet from the highway
and will consist of two sandstone
pillars roofed with red tile in keep
ing with the architecture of the
other University buildings, on each
side of the Palm Drive, according
to the plans in the offices of Comp
troller Almon E. Roth. Small arch
ways in the pillars will permit the
passage of pedestrian traffic along
the walks.
Mjpior Changes Made
Minor changes in the plan of con -
struction are to be effected, utiliz
ing brick construction with sand
stone facing. The open space be
tween the El Camino Real and the
gateway is to be landscaped.
It is expected that the work will
require approximately a month.
Work was also started on Friday
morning on the new ornamental en
trance to the Convalescent Home,
adjoining the bridge across San
Francisquito creek.
