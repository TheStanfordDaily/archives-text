A Lesson 1921
▼
In Profits 1931
nj 1 In 1921 business conditions were
■ much as they are today. Then,
■ some companies decreased 1 hoir
H advertising budget 1o cut ex
penses; others increased their ad
m vertising to offset the deprecia-
B tion in buying.
■ Statistics compiled by the Curtis
I Publishing Co. show that thirty
fl companies that increased their
■ advertising made a steady gain in
1 profits each year. Forty-six firms
I 9 which reduced their advertising
H budget showed no actual gain in
I I profits until 1924. These were
| 5 all major companies.
; 1 Conditions now are very similar
!! fl to those of 1 921. Many firms are
fl reducing their advertising. A few
$ shrewd business men. however
I realizing that money "saved" on
fl advertising is false economy—
j | that it adds too great a penalty to
! 1 their sales programs—are holding
J their advertising to its normal
k level. These men are facing no
I fl profit shrinkage.
I i There is a lesson to be learned in
!fl the experience sketched. Do you
I fall in the latter group?— One
who has profited by the lesson of
I 1921?
