# CAGERS BATTLE STRONG BRONC SQUAD TONIGHT
## Varsity, Frosh Quintets In Final Non-Conference Games Of Season BUNN PRAISES MEADE 
### Jack Jernegan 
Stanford will play its last non
conference basketball game here to
night with Santa Clara's powerful
quintet as opposition. Cardinal and
Bronco varsities are scheduled to
meet in the Pavilion at 8 o'clock,
while the freshman fives of the two
colleges will play in a preliminary
at 0:30.
Tonight's encounter will be the
next to the last which will be wit
nessed on the campus this year, the
lilt with California Saturday being
the finale.
Team Altered
A .slightly altered Stanford first
team will t;ikc the floor against the
valley team, according to an an
nouncement by Coach John Bunn
yesterday. Reggie Meade won his
way into serious notice by playing
a beautiful game down at Los An
geles in the recent unfortunate in
vasion of Troy and will displace
Tom Cordry at forward. He will
pair with Phil Moffatt tonight.
The rest of the lineup will be as
usual, with Captain Reynolds at
center, and Fawcett and Rintala at
guard.
Yesterday Bunn gave his charges
plenty of work, despite the lact that
it w.is the day before a tough game.
He alternated the starting team
with ' a sceond team made up of
Cordry, Tyler, Doub, Baker, and
Hancock, in a 45-minute scrimmage
against the Grays.
Workout Needed
The Indian coach believes that
the team needs a lot of work to be
in shape for California, and the only
reason that he is starting his. first
string for the game tonight is to get
them ready for the Bears.
Santa Clara will probably be just
what the Cardinals need to put
them in the right frame of mind to
trim Coach Nibs Price and his men,
because they will get some real op
position. One of the factors which
Bunn blames for the defeat at the
hands of U.S.C. is the easy and
lackadaisical victory over the Col
lege of the Pacific last week.
Broncos Strong
Owing to the uncertain condition
of his players, several of whom have
been injured recently, Coach Harlan
Dykes of Santa Clara has not an
nounced a starting lineup. However,
it is a certainty that he will make
every effort to present his strongest
combination, for a win from the
Indians would finish off the Bronc
season very nicely, especially since
Stanford's first team will play.
So far Santa Clara holds a deci
sion over every strong team in the
Bay Region except the Olympic
Club, and will be out to add une
more victory to the string.
