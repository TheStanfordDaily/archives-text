### 
BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. !) (A 3 ).—
The blue clad men of the Coast
Guard scored another victory to
night over that treacherous inland
sea, Lake Eric.
After a 50-hour battle with bitter
winds, blinding snow and fog, they
brought ashore ten men who had
faced death on grinding ice floes.
They were the last of 57 saved since
Saturday.
The official report of the Coast
Guard showed that 50 men went
adrift Saturday morning when a
blizzard, driven by a 50-mile wind
from the northeast, swept down
upon the lake, snapping off the sec
tions of ice on which the men were
fishing. Forty-one were rescued by
the Coast Guard, guided by air
planes chartered by local news
papers; eight walked ashore as the
floes touched shore for a moment,
while still another landed safely on
the Canadian shore when veering
wind swung the ice cake against
the northern shore of the lake.
