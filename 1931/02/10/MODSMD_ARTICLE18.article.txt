Two of the greatest motion pic- I
tures of all time, "Siegfried" and
: "Kricmheld's Revenge," will be pre
sented by the English Club in the
Assembly Hall on Thursday, the
| former at 3:"0 p.m. and the latter at.,
8 p.m. A cartoon comedy, the first]
sound picture on the campus, will !
also be shown.
"Siegfried" is a massive and spec- I
tacular photoplay, depicting the age
! of dragons, dwarfs, beautiful maid- I
ens and strong, handsome princess,
i said to be a masterpiece of film art. j
It is a German UFA production.
Based on the theme of Wagner's
immortal opera and the Norse saga,
i it will probably endure as one of I
the significant triumphs of cinema
, efforts.
| This film is declared a brilliant
example of what a master director
can do, massiveness and magnifi
cence being everywhere in evidence, j
'The cast, comprising some of the j
greatest actors in Europe, is given
wide scope for the display of its
talents. The story of the Adventures
of Siegfried, has ever conquering
spirit, and the winning of the beauti
ful Kriemhild is laid on a back
ground of massive sets such as never
before been seen on the American
screen.
Dr. William Cooper, head of the ]

German department., says that Sieg
frirl is one of tnc most fascinating of
internationally renowned films. It
is a story of adventure, love, and
knighthood." The S. F. Examiner
reviewer said, when the film was
shown in San Francisco, "yesterday
we exhausted our vocabulary in re
viewing "Siegfried." All wr can do
now is grab the Underwood, mutter
a prayer and plunge again into
superlatives."
A striking sequence in "Siegfried"
is undoubtedly thai in which the
dragon appears. This enormous
dummy is about 70 feet long and was
inconceivably heavy. Every detail
was worked out with great care by
the plastering and model department
of the great UFA studios. The hard
skin was fashioned from thin rub
ber sheeting. An effort to obtain
a breathing effect was made with
bellows, and a powerful water pump
I threw out the "blood" when the
! dragon was finally slain by Sieg
fried's sword. A forward crawling
motion was obtained by having a
number of men conccalcd if) the
body.
Admission to "Siegfried" will be
i 40 cents for adults and 25 cents for
children Admission to "Kriem
held's Revenge" is 40 cents. Tickets
| will be on sale today and tomorrow
1 at the A.S.S.U. office.
