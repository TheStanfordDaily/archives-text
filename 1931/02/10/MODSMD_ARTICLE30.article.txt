# GET RID OF THE DEAD WOOD
## 
### 
Flection day is here again, and as usual Iho ballots arc
( lutlered u) > with the names of nominees for the many
worthless class olliees lo he filled. For everv one of I lie four
clashes a president, a vice-presidcnl, a secretary, and a
treasurer iuis to he chosen.
Stanford class olliees mean little, if anything. They
never did. The chief reason for this is that, with the pos
sible exception of the presidents and treasurers, the class
ollieers have nothing to do. Their olliees are of value only
:is snhject matter for sonic of those "success hoys ;il Stan
ford" letters lo the folks al home.
The class presidents have ;i few minor duties lo lend 10,
as have the treasurers. Functions of the two olliees could
easily he combined, leaving to the president of each class
nil administrative work now necessary for the success and
prosperity of the various classes, ('.lass presidents would
not be over-burdened by the addition of the treasurers'
duties to their olliees. All class financial matters have to
pass through the A.S.S.I . olliees and be checked bv the
student manager, so the change would make no difference
in the ultimate handling of these ilenjs.
The olliees of class vice-president, secretary, and treas
urer constitute just so much dead wood in the Stanford
student organization that never had any excuse for being
and should long ago have been discarded.
In regard to Hie election today, it might be well for the
campus voters lo pay particular attention lo their choice of
candidates for Men's Council. The Honor ('.ode and its
enforcement have been under .lire in recent weeks, and
there has been an unusual amount ol discussion concerning
the (lode, pro and con. The Men's and Women's Councils
are the bodies constituted to enforce Hie (lode and punish
violators.
Selection ol men for the Council who will enforce the
provisions of the Honor Code is the only means Stanford
students have of guaranteeing and justifying the Code's
existence.
