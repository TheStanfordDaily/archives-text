ORCHESTRA—At (lie Cumin
Theatre.
Last Sunday's program opened
i with the First Symphony of Hubert
Schumann. It is a gay work, sym
bolieul ol' spring, with alternate
moments of youthful enthusiasm
and delicate grace. Mr. Dobrowen,
j the conductor, brought out the
1 vigorous nature of the Symphony
j by emphasizing these changes in
mood. From this sprightly work the
1 program took a quieter turn to the
meditative Violin Concerto of
| Brahms. Nathan Milstein gave a
| brilliant rendition of this number,
! but one could not help feeling that
brilliance was not' exactly the qual
ity required in the major part of the
Concerto. However in the vigorous
; Finale, the soloist was at bis best.
As a contrast, the program closed
with the wild dances of the Polovsti
I Irom Borodin's "Prince Igor."
Next Sunday, the orchestra plays
a popular program containing a Mo
: /.art. Symphony, two pieces from
1 Mendelssohn's "Midsummer Night's
j Dream" music, and Tschaikowsky's
"Romeo and Juliet." - N. B.

George Jean Nathan. Alfred A.
Knopf. $2.50.

Nathan is most entertaining of
witty writers and demonstrates close
acquaintance with that not-too-of
ten boorr companion of wit a basic
j something to say.
Fearless, frankly egotistical and
fascinatingly so, he states his philo
sophy here without, thought or de
, sire that it be adopted by others. It
is, briefly: work moderately, live
' independently, attain happiness in
the moments that you may. Such
corrolaries as are appended concern
drink, marriage, and other equally
j amusing brow-wrinklers.
Nathan has ever been an optimist
concerning the future of his love,
the theatre. He deplores the quality
of a great deal of the drama which
pervades our theatres, but lis never
despairs.

Nathan is most entertaining of
witty writers and demonstrates close
acquaintance with that not-too-of
ten boorr companion of wit a basic
j something to say.
Fearless, frankly egotistical and
fascinatingly so, he states his philo
sophy here without, thought or de
, sire that it be adopted by others. It
is, briefly: work moderately, live
' independently, attain happiness in
the moments that you may. Such
corrolaries as are appended concern
drink, marriage, and other equally
j amusing brow-wrinklers.
Nathan has ever been an optimist
concerning the future of his love,
the theatre. He deplores the quality
of a great deal of the drama which
pervades our theatres, but lis never
despairs.

TESTAMENT OF A CRITIC. Hy
George Jean Nathan. Alfred A.
Knopf. $2.50.

Nathan is most entertaining of
witty writers and demonstrates close
acquaintance with that not-too-of
ten boorr companion of wit a basic
j something to say.
Fearless, frankly egotistical and
fascinatingly so, he states his philo
sophy here without, thought or de
, sire that it be adopted by others. It
is, briefly: work moderately, live
' independently, attain happiness in
the moments that you may. Such
corrolaries as are appended concern
drink, marriage, and other equally
j amusing brow-wrinklers.
Nathan has ever been an optimist
concerning the future of his love,
the theatre. He deplores the quality
of a great deal of the drama which
pervades our theatres, but lis never
despairs.
Comments upon playwrights, lat

jest innovatory gesture of the :
j movies, actors, plays—all voiced in i

! Nt:W YORK. By Paul Morand,
translated by llannsli Miles. Holt, j
MHO. (At the I'alo Alto Book
Shop.)
More is New York as a Frenchman :
: sees it. Even though, as a native |
New Yorker, the reviewer can tes- ;
i tify to its accuracy, M. Morand has !
added nothing new I" his recital j
| of the manifold charms of the Big ;
I City, except a vivid style, which '
j consists mainly of a nice way with
I adjectives.
From Broadway to Little lLaly ,
and the Battery to the Bronx, M. I
Morand sets forth the familiar facets
! of metropolitan life. Nothing new j
! or exciting to anybody who knows i
i his New York, is this book, but to a ■
j Frenchman in the provinces, and *
j the unfortunates in the "sticks" who 1
| do not follow the wanderings of a I
| host of syndicated Broadway col
umnists, like O. O. Mclntyre, it is j
j full of interest and excitement.

, ASH WEDNESDAY. By T. S. Eliot. !
Fountain Press, mo. $5.00. (At
Stanford Bookstore.)
■ Of all our experimenters, T. S. j
(Eliot shows, perhaps, the greatest :j
'piomise of a full development.
He is still, in poetic form, a mod- j
ernist, though he has become a i
' Catholic, a monarchist, and an Eng- •
, lish citizen. The theme of "Ash j
Wednesday" is this quest of the au- '
thor for order and classical author- !
ity. Evident in this work is the
grace of expression which has won
: for the author a high place in con
lem pprary 11 teratu re.
"Ash Wednesday" is a beautifully
bound and printed volume. There
are only a few pages of poetry, but
one is forced to the conclusion that
bits of the verse are worthy of the
publisher's labor, and the resulting
; price. —E. E. W. i
