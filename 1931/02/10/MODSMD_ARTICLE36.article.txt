The barbers around the Univer
i sity of Illinois offered the student
bedy $500 to call off a beard grow
| ing contest involving 2500 men
j which was ruining their trade. The
[ students refused!
The 500 might raise some
money for their gym fund IF
I hey t'i>uld convince Stanford
men to stop shaving; then de
mand the barbers pay a sum;
I, and finally (hardest of all) con
vince the men to stop the con
test once it was started.
It is claimed at Michigan State
I College that only one out of four
freshmen can stand the grind of
j college life.
Evidently fusel oil in cocktails
or midnight lamps does not
agree with (he frosli.

The so-called dirty cord fad is
| distasteful to the dean of women of
the University of Oregon.
This custom must also prove quite
I anoying to cleaning merchants lo
i coled in college towns.
The University, of Wisconsin
J claims that students at small col
leges are still "collegiate" while ma
! jor universities have ceased to be so
1 inclined.
The content of eollcgiatisni
may have changed from "I'll die
FOR my alma mater" to "I'll die
: IN (his alma mater if the fac
ulty doesn't loosen up with some
grades," but students are still
collegiate none the less.

The dean of Albion College
I claims that women do not; care for
1 the "he-man" type.
Perhaps so, hut did any one ever
' see a fair young thing fall on a
I man's neck and gurgle, "What did
you make your KEY in—chemistry
or zoological sciences?"
It iS claimed at Ohio State College
that co-eds told not to go with men
who drink, smoke, and pet, develop
inhibitions of all men.
If this is true, it is very evi
dent that few women have been
told such things.
Claremont College is conducting
a personality contest for men and
women.
Modern personality is that
thing which makes it possible
for you to slap the host's back
at an extra-formal dinner party
and get away with it.
