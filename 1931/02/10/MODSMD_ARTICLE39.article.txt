# EXCAVATIONS TO BE FINISHED TODAY FOR STANFORD GATEWAY
## 
### 
Excavations for the concrete j
foundations of the Palm Drive gate
way are expected to be completed !
today, according to reports from the
Comptroller's office. The ground
is matted with roots and gravel and j
the work has been necessarily slow. :
Carpenters will build the forms for j
the concrete as soon as the excava- !
tions are complete. The actual pour- j
ing of the concrete will probably be i
completed within a day after the j
forms are put in place.
The landscaping of the area be- j
tween the gateway and the highway
will be done by University gardeners j
and will be carried out during the j
construction of the pillars of the i
gateway.
The new gateway to the Convales- j
cent Home which is also under con
struction will take approximately !
the same foi-m as the Palm Drive ,
structure. The same sandstone faced
brick construction will be used ac
cording to Comptroller Almon E.
Roth.
