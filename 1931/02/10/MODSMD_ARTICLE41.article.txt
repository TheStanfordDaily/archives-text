# FRENCH TABLE THURSDAY
## 
### 
The French Table will meet for
lunch on Thursday noon instead of |
Wednesday noon from now on. This |
change has been made necessary
by the formation of a new Interna
tional Table which meets in the
Union Alcove every Wednesday. At
the French Table, French is ex
clusively the language used. Any
one interested in French conversa
tion is invited to be present.
