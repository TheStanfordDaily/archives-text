Just another word about (hat
Trojan-Indian disaster d®wn
Soulli last Saturday night be
fore passing on to fhe coming
(est which faces the Cardinal
basketeers when they attempt to
wrest a series victory from the
Bears by taking at least one of
tlu* two remaining tussles. The
story as outlined by Couch John
Itiiiui yesterday seems to bear
out that it was just one of
"those nights" for the redshirted
quintet.
Though it might sound like ihe
proverbial sour grape tale to a rabid
U.S.C. fan, one who knows both
teams could see it no other way
than from the "What was wrong
with Stanford?'' angle. For without
detracting from the glory deserved
by the winner, which v/as unques
tionably the better team on that
particular evening, it's a cinch that
something WAS wrong with the
Indians.
Bunn calls Saturday night's
game (he worst his men have
yet played, not excepting the
opening (ill with San Jose, and
ascribes the terrible showing to
a mental state, though just what
brings about that unexplainable
condition is always a mystery.
In the ftrst place, the easy vic
tory over Pacific last Tuesday
didn't do the Cardinals anv
good, especially since they had
won three conference tilts in a
row, and were in quite a confi
dent state of mind. *
Another factor which undoubtedly
played a part was the hoodoo of
Southern California refereeing. A
team which has no confidence in the
referees is not going to play its best
ball, especially when their fears of
atrocious officiating are realized
from the starting whistle.
Incidentally, IS persona! fouls
were chalked up against the In
dians. while U.S.C. was penal
ized but seven times. During the
course of the evening, Messrs.
Lee Dempsey and Bill Dunn
managed to pass up numerous
fouls committed by both teams,
li -sides calling no small number
which were m\series even to the
player to whom the gift was
donated.
After Bill Doub had been in the
contest for some time he pushed
one of the U.S.C. men a little too
hard (probably accidentally), caus
ing that gentleman to fall heavily
tf> the hardwood clear out in the
end zone. Later in the game Baker
fumbled a ball near the sidelines
and it rolled out. In the sincere be
lief that he should be allowed the
privilege of throwing it in, Baker
picked it up, tossed it in to Faw
cett, and the play continued. It
. eems that the officials noticed nei
ther of these irregularities.
The Bronco contest in the
Pavilion tonight should be well
worth an hour or m> away from
the books. The Santa Clarans
are rated as the best college
basketball team in California,
and victories which they hold
over California, Y.M.1.. and the
(J. of S.F. seem to bear out the
contention. Remember that San
Francisco beat the Indians down
here early in the season.
Nicholas at forward for the visi
tors will be the man to watch. He
is a Consistent high-point man for
iiis team, and scored no less than 19
points against the Bears. Captain
Leahy is the mainstay of the
Broncos on defense, and his shoot
ing eye is not so bad either, thank
you. —Crawford.
