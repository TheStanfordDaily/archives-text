### Lowell Cox 
By Lowell Cox

With Keith Topping back in the
lineup for Stanford, tonight's fresh
man-Bronco coll preliminary to the
varsity-Santa Clara hoop clash may
be expected to be one of the best
yearling games of the season.
Topping, who has been absent
from the squad for a week because
of injuries, will be paired at for
ward with Massey at the opening
tip-off, with Packard at center, and
Wright and Jenkins at the guard
posts.
Gets Oft' at 0:30
T'he Colts will invade the Pavilion
at (!:30 o'clock with a squad of big,
rangy players, and Coach John
Bonn's babe quintet will need to
lie at maximum strength to take
them into camp.
Since Jenkins rejoined the squad
at the beginning of the quarter, the
frosh have had the edge on their
opponents in the matter of height.
How Packard, Jenkins & company
will function against equally rangy
players remains to be seen.
Battle Expected
The yearlings have been function
ing smoothly of late, however, and
have a good chance to come out on
top tonight if they do not strike
another slump, as happened earlier
in the season. In any event, a battle
royal is in store.
Continuing their winning streak,
the Colts Friday night trounced the
San Francisco Boys' Club, 30 to 14,
while the Indian frosh were without
a game all week-end. In a scrim
mage with the Grays Saturday af
ternoon the babe's appeared in good
form, coming out on the long end of
a 32 to 19 count.
Should the frosh'successfully hur
dle Santa Clara, they would be con
ceded a good chance to even the
California series when they meet
the Cubs in the second game Satur
day night.
