# FROSH BALL SQUAD LACKS PLAYERS FOR SECOND FULL NINE
## 
### 
With less than enough men to |
make up two full teams, the Indian j
frosh ball players are going to have .
difficulty in displaying anything like ]
a well rounded aggregation on the j
diamond this year.
Stan Anderson, the babe's sole and '
only chucker will develop into iron I
man fame if he negotiates many |
successive Saturday's like last week's
thirteen inning grilling he went
through.
Coach Cuddcback is disappointed
in the back stopping efforts shown
by the Cardinals. Ten men were al- !
lowed to purloin a bag in the Mis- j
sion High fracas.
The next scheduled event on the j
program for Cuddeback's proteges J
is a game with Berkeley High School ]
this coming Saturday.
