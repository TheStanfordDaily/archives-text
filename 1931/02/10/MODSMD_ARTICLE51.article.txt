# DIANA, GODDESS OF GOLF
## ,Diana Fishwick, Queen of British Golf, to Compete in Three Winter Tournaments in United States 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Welcome, Diana Fishwick! The
' Queen of British golf is here to try
! her skill and luck in the winter
I tournaments in Florida. Miss Diana
| Fishwick, conqueror of Glenna Col
lett, greatest of all American women
players in the finals of the British
women's championship last May, ar
| rived in New York on February 3
I in company with several other lead
ing British women players.
She will compete in the Florida
championship at Palm Beach, Feb
ruary 16, in the South Atlantic
championship at Ormond Beach,
February 24, and in. the Fast Coast
championship at St. Augustine,
March 3.
Victory Was Not Upset
To say that the attractive nine
teen-year-old British girl upset the
dope when she beat Glenna would
be putting it mildly. It was practi
cally taken for granted that the
American champion would walk off
with the title which she had been
seeking for so many years, for both
Joyce Wethered, who had beaten
her in 1929, and Miss Cecil Leitch,
the next best Britisher, were miss
ing from the tournament.
But it was not to be. Glenna,

beaten by Molly Gourlay in the
team matches at Sunningdale soon
after the Americans had landed, re
versed the decision at Formby, and
after conquering Enid Wilson, who
had eliminated Helen Hicks, ap
peared to have an easy match in
the finals.
Wins 4 Up at Fifteenth
Bat the â€¢nineteen-year-old Diana
coolly went to work and polished
off the best that the New World
could produce, rising to the occa
sion like a true Britisher and win
ning four up at the fifteenth hole.
Thus Britain, which would have
liked to have seen Glenna win, was
even happier because the homebred
youngster had kept at least one golf
crown from going overseas.
The fact that the petite Miss Fish
wick was competing in her first wo
men's championship made her feat
all the more remarkable. Britain's
golf heroine has been playing the
game ever since she was eleven
years old and in 1927 and 1928 won
the Girls' championship. This is this
modern Diana's first visit to the
United States, and it will be her
first experience with the new and
large golf ball.
