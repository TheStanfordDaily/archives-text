# EASTMAN AIDS BOXING SQUAD FOR AGGIE GO
## Targhetta Shows Promise As Heavyweight Star; Team Trains Hard 
### 
With hopes for a victorious season
increased by the welcome return of
George Eastman, an experienced
welter, to the boxing fold, Coach
Harry Malopey's varsity boxing
squad yesterday afternoon began
intensive training this Friday at
Davis with the California Aggies for
its record intercollegiate match.
Yesterday, giving Eastman per
sonal attention in the ring, Maloney
predicted that his protege would
break into the Stanford roster for
at least one of the forthcoming in
tercollegiate contests.
Targhetta Good
Packing a punishing sock in either
hand Paul Targhetta, Maloney's en
try in the heavyweight division, is
showing more ring form every time
he dons the padded mitts. Game and
colorful in the ring, forever trying
to get inside his opponent's defense
and taking plenty of punishment in
the attempt, the stocky, red headed
Targhetta, under Maloney's eye, is
getting some of the experience he
needs. Targhetta had A1 Theiss, the
U of Nevada's big Boy, practically
out of the picture in their bout last
Thursday, but inexperience and
short arms, stopped Paul from
finishing his man. As it was. Theiss
rallied in an extra session decreed
by the judges, and won the decision.
Stiff Workouts
Boxing and more boxing will make
up the program of Wednesday's
workout, according to Maloney. In
side the ropes, members of the team
will be matched against each other
in a series of one-round mixups.
The Stanford line-up for the bouts
with Cal Aggies will probably be
announced tomorrow.
