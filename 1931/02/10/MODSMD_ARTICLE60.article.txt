# SEMI-PRO OUTFIT TO MEET INDIANS IN MID-WEEK GAME
## Catching And Right Field Positions Still Open; Hitting To Decide 
### 
With only three days left for prac
tice and one game on Wednesday
with the Berkeley Independents, the
Stanford baseball varsity is putting
in some intensive training for its
first league game with Santa Clara
on Saturday, February 14. This first
league game will also be the occa
sion of the formal dedication of the
new ball parlc.
Two positions still seem to be
pretty much in doubt on the Indian
nine, catcher and light field. The
battle for the receiving job has nar
rowed down to Pihl and Miller.
Doth of these men showed up well
in last Saturday's game, and the
outcome will undoubtedly be de
cided on the relative hilling ability
which they show during practice.
The right field berth is not so
easy to decide with such candidates
as Dixon, Riede, Stine, and Wood
worth competing for the position.
The willow-wielding ability of any
one of these ball hawks will decide,
who gets the assignment in this
position also.
All the pitchers on the squad are
reported to have their "business"
arms in good shape. Ernie Caddel,
who last week was suffering from a
sore shoulder, was back on the slab
in yesterday's practice.
