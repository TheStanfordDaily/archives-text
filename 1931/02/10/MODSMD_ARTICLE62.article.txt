# NEW DISCOVERIES MADE BY EINSTEIN AT MOUNT WILSON
## Study Of Gaseous Layers About Sun Produce Vital Theories 
### 
PASADENA, Calif., Feb. 9 (A*).—
Nt'W discoveries about the sun's
atmosphere have been disclosed to
Albert Einstein at the Mount Wil
son solar observatory here.
It is 'J,OOO miles deep, compared
with the 100 miles of the earth's
atmosphere. The outermost layer of
the earth's atmosprere is composed
of the lightest gases, helium and
hydrogen.
The sun's atmosphere is quite dif
ferent, the outermost layer being
of ionized calcium, forty times heav
ier than the layer of hydrogen three
thousand miles closer to the sun.
Photosphere lonized
In the earth's atmosphere the first
seven miles from the earth form a
layer in which wind storms occur
up to a velocity of 200 miles per
hour. This is a layer of turbulence
in the earth's atmosphere. At 35
miles out argon disappears, at GO
miles there is no more oxygen, and
at 70 miles nitrogen disappears, leav
ing only helium and hydrogen for
the last thirty miles to the hundred
mile limit.
At the sun the first fifty miles
from its surface is what astronomers
call the photosphere. This is heavily
ionized, and all wavelengths are
lound in this strata, which result
in the white light being emitted that
reaches the earth, 93,000,000 miles
away as sunlight. It takes but eight
and a half minutes for this light to
reach the earth.
