# FELLOWSHIP HOSTESSES PRESIDE AT TEAS FOR STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS
## 
### 
Afternoon tea week (four days)
for all students and professors, is a
novel feature of campus life in
augurated by the Stanford Fellow
ship Board. The Fellowship hos
tesses preside over such gatherings
held in the Fellowship room on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house.
The list of hostesses for the teas
has been slightly changed by the
board and several new names have
been added. Hostesses for each day
will be drawn from the following
list: Monday, Ruth Beede, Elizabeth
McCulloch, Isabell Warren; Tues
day, Caroline Hall, Lucille Morgan,
Elizabeth West, Pauline Wilson;
Wednesday, Elizabeth Hewit, Nancy
Jones, Susan Noble, Ann Adams;
Thursday, Mary Alverna Givan,
Dolores Van Patten.
The Board was formed, some three
years ago, by a few students who
realized that the social relations be
tween faculty and students on this

campus had been greatly neglected.
In fact, students seen conversing
with their professors outside of the
classroom are frequently looked
upon suspiciously by their fellow
students as "apple polishers."
Thus, by campus opinion, students
were deprived of one of the greatest
advantages of a university life—the
opportunity of social contact with
those whose broad culture, as well
as their expertness in their own
field, make a university what it is.
And, on the other hand, the profes
sor is inclined to lose touch with
students' problems when his only
chance of meeting the student is
from behind the professorial desk.
To counteract this undesirable
tendency of professor and student
to keep in two separate social groups,
the Fellowship Board is attempting
to bridge the gap by extending a
standing invitation to all students
and professors of the University to
. meet informally.
