###

dents and to Stanford students in j
particular was issued yesterday af- |
ternoon by South San Francisco

traffic accidents in that locality in
the past few months, a campaign to j
reduce speeding is being conducted j
by officers there

Twelve Stanford students have
been arrested within the past several l
days in the South San Francisco 1
district

"We arc not interested in arrest- j
ing people," a South San Francisco
leader said yesterday. "We ax - e only
interested in reducing the death and
injury toll. It is natural for drivers i
to ti'avel the highway rapidly and j
come through South City at a j
greater rate of speed than they sus- j
pect. But it is dangerous and we !
need co-operation to effect a needed j
reform."
