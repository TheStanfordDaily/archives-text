# PAPER TO BE EDITED BY STANFORD CLASS
## 
### 
Several new aspects of the ex
periment that the class in Editorial
Management will undertake next
Saturday in publishing the local
Gilroy paper for a day were dis
closed by members of the class yes
terday. No material whatever, it
now appears, will be gathered by
the regular staff of the paper but
members of the Stanford class will
be assigned to the beats. It will be
necessary, therefore, for part of the
class to be in Gilroy on Friday, af
ternoon and for the rest to be on the
ground early Saturday morning.
Previous copies of the Gilroy
paper received by the class indicate
no dearth of thrilling news in the
valley town. To supplement the lo
cal gossip, the class is planning to
run a biography of Sam Mac Donald,
present superintendent of grounds
at Stanford and native son of Gil
roy.
