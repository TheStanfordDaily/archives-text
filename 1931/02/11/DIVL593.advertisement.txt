Let no one persuade you to acccpi
■iome inferior pen, and throw in v j
vague guarantee, or a fancy box, in
place of a Guarantee for Life b)
Parker. There arc no loopholes in
the Parker guarantee.
And there is no other point like
thePrcssureless-Writing Duofold. It
iets you write as easy as you breathe.
Hence, not having to focus youi
thought on what you are doing, you
concentrate on what you are saying.,
Go and see these new, balanced, |
streamlined Beauties that have \IA%
more ink capacity than average, size l
for size, and are convertible for Desk
ifid Pocket, at will.
