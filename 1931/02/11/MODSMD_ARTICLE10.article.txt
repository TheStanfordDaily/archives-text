### 
Two more magnificant motion pic
tures have come out of Germany,
"Siegfried" and "Kriemheld's Re
venge," and both will be shown in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow by the
English Club, the former at 3:30
o'clock and the latter at 8 o'clock.
The first sound picture to be shown
on the campus, a cartoon comedy,
will also be presented.

Both of these UFA productions
j have been filmed in a sufficiently
j masterful manner to make them
stand out among the best moving
pictures ever made. Based on old
: myths, they portray the earth as
: filled with dragons, monstrosities,
bold heroes and beautiful maidens.
â–  Massive sets and spectacular scenes
are used to great advantage, a 70
j foot dragon being among the effects.
I "Siegfried" is the story of the re
' markable adventures of the Norse
! man, and "Kriemheld's Revenge"
j tells of a woman's talent for aveng-
I ing his death.

! Admission to "Siegfried" will be
! 40 cents for adults and 25 cents for
' children. Admission to "Kriem
| hold's Revenge" is 40 cents. Tickets
will be on sale today at the A.S.S.U.
| office.
