with the cellar berth of league VII
as the deserts of the losing quintet;

Alpha Kappa Lambda, 31; Delta
Upsilon, 14; Breakers-El Tigre, post
poned.
Alpha Kappa Lambda's basketball
team pulled away from Delta Upsi
lon in the second half to score a
clean cut 31-14 victory last night in
the Eneina gymnasium in the only
intramural game of the evening.
Featuring the contest was the indi
vidual duel between Cornell of the
A.K.L.'s and Rendle of the D.U.'s.
Each man was the scoring mainstay
of his quintet and as they went, so
went the game. During the first
half, Cornell tallied ten points,
Rendle, eight; the team scores at
the end of this period were 13-8 in
favor of the A.K.L.'s. The score was
indicative of abilities, for Cornell
received better support from his
teammates than the D.U. mainstay
as well as turning in a slightly better
performance.
A.K.L. Attack Improves
In the second half, the A.K.L.'s
showed an improved passing attack,
the D.U.'s slowed up a bit, Cornell
accounted for 10 more points, Rendel
got but five. Also the closely
watched Cornell started passing to
his neglected running mates, Marple
and Jones, who each dropped in
several buckets. Result: 31-14.
Victory kept alive faint chance of
the A.K.L.'s to win league ll's title.
Their loss to the league leading
Dekes had almost erased their hopes,
but if they beat Phi Kaps and the
Pi Kaps in turn beat the Dekes,
thfere will be a triple tie for the di
vision's premier honors.
Present standings of the three
teams:
Won Lost
Delta Kappa Epsilon 3 0
Phi Kappa Sigma 3 0
