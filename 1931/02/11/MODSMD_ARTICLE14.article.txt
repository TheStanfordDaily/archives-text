WASHINGTON, Feb. 10. f/P)
j Proposal to abolish or limit trading
lin grain and cotton futures en
veloped the Senate agriculture com
mittee today in a storm of protest
i from the presidents of New York
| and Chicago cotton and grain ex
changes.
J. C. Murray, president of the
Chicago Board of Trade, contended
! in a letter to Chairman McNary that
| the Capper bill to give the Secre
j tary of Agriculture a greater con
j trol over the grain exchanges would
practically "destroy" the business
his board had conducted for 80
| years.
I "The result will be," Murray
; said,, "that some foreign market,
presumably Winnipeg in Canada,
J will supersede the Chicago Board
of Trade as the great grain market
of the worldâ€”with the broad free
market that has been established
there and with the facilities of
transportation available by both
rail and water, the possibilities of a
corner or a 'squeeze' has been re
duced to a minimum."
