# COURT TO DISCUSS STATUTE TO FORBID THUMBING OF NOSE
## 
### 
A statute prohibiting the thumbing
of one's nose will be the rather un
usual point of argument in a moot
trial to be held tomorrow by stu
dents in the School of Law.

With Professor George E. Osborne,
of the law school, as judge, the trial
will be held in room 12 and will be
open to the public.
John M. Cranston and Robert A.
Hume will argue one side of the
case, while John P. Jennings and
Adron A. Beene will uphold the
other.
The trial involves a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus for a defend
ant who had been jailed after violat
ing an injunction restraining him
from thumbing his nose at his
neighbor. The entire proceedings
will be of a fictitious nature, and it
is expected that they will be one
of the most interesting of the series'
of semi-final trials now being held.
