### 
WASHINGTON, Fob. 10 (/Hi.â€”
I Moving shortly after the treasury
! had issued orders to bar convict pro
! duced lumber and pulpwood from
! northern Russia, the House ways
and means committee today ap
proved a bill to exclude forced labor
(products from all countries.
The treasury ordered collectors of

: customs to require that importers of
1 lumber and pulpwood from four sec
tions of northern Russia to prove
! that convict labor did not enter into
their production.
Officials expect the legality of (he
action to be questioned in the courts
; by the importers. They declined t,o
disclose the new evidence.
