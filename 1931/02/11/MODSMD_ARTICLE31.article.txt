# CARD HOOPMEN CHALK UP LEAD EARLY IN GAME
## Santa Clara Stages Second Half Rally, Finally Defeated 24-21 INVADERS BELOW PAR Moffatt Exhibits Uncanny Art In Looping Goals 
### Stewart Crawford 
Starting in whirlwind fashion to
pile up a .10 to 1 lead before the
Broncos.could find their stride, the
Indian basketball five managed to
keep out. in front of a rallying
Santa Clara quintet last night in the
Pavilion to come out on the long
end of a 24 to 21 final count.
The Redskins owe their victory to
the uncanny shooting of Phil Mof
fatt, who gathered six field goals
during the evening, and to the fact
that the invaders were far below
their, usual standard of play. Cou
pled with this, the Stanford defense
was fairly effective, especially the
guarding of Rudy Rintala.
MofTatt Scores First
After the first tip-off, the ball
went to "Phancy Phil," who pro
ceeded to drop in a long one to
open the scoring festivities. A mo
ment later Meade got his hands on
the ball, and passed to Moffatt, who
caged a cripple shot after the
smoothest-working quick bi'eak (hat
we have seen the Indians make this
season.
Not until Moffatt put in the third
field goal of the tilt did the Broncos
begin to find their shooting eye,
which had been failing sadly up to
this time. During the remainder of
the half the play was basket for
basket, with the gun sounding just
after Meade had scored with a
beautiful long shot from near the
center of the court to put the count
at 1G to 8.
Reynolds Sinks Set-Up
The two teams waged a scoreless
five-minute battle at the start of
the second period until Reynold..;
broke in to sink one of the numer
ous set-up attempts which the visi
tors had been offering him all eve
ning. It was then that Nicholas,
dead-eye forward for the visitors,
began to locate the basket and
dropped three beautiful shots in
quick succession. Captain Leahy at
guard for the Broncs also hit his
stride at this point, and it became a
question of how long the Indian#
could stay out in front.

A couple of more field goals by
MofTatt, together with some foul
conversions by Vance Fawcett kept
the invaders at. arm's length, Ihe
three-point margin at the final gun
being the closest point in the lusslo;

"Dazzy" Vance, as usual, showed
the best floorwork for the Cardinals,
while Meade at forward did a lot
of clever passing, and at times
broke up the Bronco advances
single-handedly.

For Santa Clara, Leahy demon
strated why he is rated as one of
the, best guards on the coast. Every
time he got his hands on the ball
got set, even in the center of
the floor, Ihc Farm fans held their
collective breath. .He is the most
accurate shot from a distance that
we have seen this year.

caged a cripple shot after the
smoothest-working quick bi'eak (hat
we have seen the Indians make this
season.
Not until Moffatt put in the third
field goal of the tilt did the Broncos
begin to find their shooting eye,
which had been failing sadly up to
this time. During the remainder of
the half the play was basket for
basket, with the gun sounding just
after Meade had scored with a
beautiful long shot from near the
center of the court to put the count
at 1G to 8.
Reynolds Sinks Set-Up
The two teams waged a scoreless
five-minute battle at the start of
the second period until Reynold..;
broke in to sink one of the numer
ous set-up attempts which the visi
tors had been offering him all eve
ning. It was then that Nicholas,
dead-eye forward for the visitors,
began to locate the basket and
dropped three beautiful shots in
quick succession. Captain Leahy at
guard for the Broncs also hit his
stride at this point, and it became a
question of how long the Indian#
could stay out in front.

A couple of more field goals by
MofTatt, together with some foul
conversions by Vance Fawcett kept
the invaders at. arm's length, Ihe
three-point margin at the final gun
being the closest point in the lusslo;

"Dazzy" Vance, as usual, showed
the best floorwork for the Cardinals,
while Meade at forward did a lot
of clever passing, and at times
broke up the Bronco advances
single-handedly.

For Santa Clara, Leahy demon
strated why he is rated as one of
the, best guards on the coast. Every
time he got his hands on the ball
got set, even in the center of
the floor, Ihc Farm fans held their
collective breath. .He is the most
accurate shot from a distance that
we have seen this year.
Starting in whirlwind fashion to
pile up a .10 to 1 lead before the
Broncos.could find their stride, the
Indian basketball five managed to
keep out. in front of a rallying
Santa Clara quintet last night in the
Pavilion to come out on the long
end of a 24 to 21 final count.
The Redskins owe their victory to
the uncanny shooting of Phil Mof
fatt, who gathered six field goals
during the evening, and to the fact
that the invaders were far below
their, usual standard of play. Cou
pled with this, the Stanford defense
was fairly effective, especially the
guarding of Rudy Rintala.
MofTatt Scores First
After the first tip-off, the ball
went to "Phancy Phil," who pro
ceeded to drop in a long one to
open the scoring festivities. A mo
ment later Meade got his hands on
the ball, and passed to Moffatt, who
caged a cripple shot after the
smoothest-working quick bi'eak (hat
