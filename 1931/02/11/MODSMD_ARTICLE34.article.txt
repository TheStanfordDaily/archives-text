# WHAT THE CALIFORNIAN THINKS ABOUT IT
## 
### 
Severe criticism of Seerelary Wilbur and President
Hoover was expressed editorially yesterday J>v Frederick
Hot/, editor of The Haiti) (latifornian. Several points in the
editorial require correction.
In the first place, Hot/ charges thai Stanford is at pres
ent "the scene of discordant policies, neglected by the ad
ministration." The University is not the scene of discordant
politics. The administration, under Dr. Swain, acting presi
dent who now has complete authority in directing Stan
ford's affairs, lias pursued during recent months a policy
no different nor more inharmonious than that of the last
few years.
Secondly, Hot/ declares that "decreased revenues are
beginning to have effect." For many years Stanford's bud
get has shown a gradual annual increase. During each of
these years, and including the present one, funds adequate
to meet the budget have been available.
Thirdly, The (Udifornian editorial remarks, "The Uni
versity has either been unwilling to, or incapable of, replac
ing the shacks that house fraternities and sororities." There
is no doubt that the shacks do exist and are not being re
placed. II is true that Ihe University is unable to replace
them, but not because of unwillingness to do so. Long has
Ihe University had a plan for Ihe permanent housing of
Stanford living groups, a project which would cost between
two and live million dollars to carry out. The University, of
course, is unable at present to finance such a program. Hut
not because it doesn't want to.
Finally, Hot/ remarks, "President Wilbur is no doubt a
worthy man, but America is not so depleted of executives
that one man must hold both a high governmental position
and a university presidency." If Ihe decision of the Hoard
of Trustees made October 215, HKiO, is to be believed, Dr.
W ilbur is not occupying two positions. At that time the
board granted "the request of Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur for
a leave of absence as president of the University, without
salary, for one year, from September 1, 1930." The board
further ruled that, during his absence, it would look to Dr.
Swain "as active executive head of the University, to as
stime and exercise ail the functions and responsibilities
of president." That, certainly, is not indicative of a dis
cordant policy, if all its provisions are being observed.
llolz mentions the proposed elimination of the lower
division. The Daily still views this suggested and already
partially carried out plan of abolishing the lower division
as unwise and contrary to the best interests of Stanford.
Following is The Haiti] C.atifornian editorial:
"A university president should act as a university presi
dent in working hours.
"Stanford University, at present Ihe scene of discordant
policies, neglected by Ihe administration and unable to
maintain or initiate campus improvements, is an excellent
example of what happens when a university president
chooses to inaugurate policies over Ihe telephone.
"Despite Ihe fact thai an entire continent lies between
President Wilbur and his duties, plans have been laid for
the creation of a two year university and restrictions have
been placed on Ihe lower division with thai end in view.
"Alumni criticism is becoming louder, decreased reve
nues are beginning to have effect, Stanford is gradually
losing its popularity with professors, and even Ihe garden
ers have been threatened with entry lo the ranks of unem
ployed.

"Despite denials of the administration regarding fin
ances, several tilings remain obvious. The university has
either been unwilling to, or incapable of, replacing the
shacks that house fraternities and sororities. Perhaps a
reason exists, and the condition cannot be blamed on fin
ances. However, the matter of an improper student health
service is of far more serious concern.
"President Wilbur is no doubt a worthy man, hul Amer
ica is not so depleted of executives that one man must hold
both a high governmental position and a university presi
dency.
"With all due respect to Herbert Hooker, we fail to see
whv the President of the t'nited Slates should automati

is no doubt that the shacks do exist and are not being re

them, but not because of unwillingness to do so. Long has
Ihe University had a plan for Ihe permanent housing of
Stanford living groups, a project which would cost between

not because it doesn't want to.
Finally, Hot/ remarks, "President Wilbur is no doubt a

of Trustees made October 215, HKiO, is to be believed, Dr.
W ilbur is not occupying two positions. At that time the
board granted "the request of Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur for
a leave of absence as president of the University, without
salary, for one year, from September 1, 1930." The board
further ruled that, during his absence, it would look to Dr.
Swain "as active executive head of the University, to as
stime and exercise ail the functions and responsibilities
of president." That, certainly, is not indicative of a dis
