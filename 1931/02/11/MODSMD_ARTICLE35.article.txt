INSPIRATION — At the Varsity I
Theatre.
Best ot Greta Garbo's three talk
ies is "Inspiration," the story of the
French model. Here we have the (
gorgeous Garbo at her very best, a
little less sombre and cool than
usual, in fact reaching new heights
in gaiety and charm. She is the i
toast of Paris, everybody's secret !
passion, and she falls for Robert
Montgomery, straightforward stu- j
dent.
The stoi'y isn't the last word in 1
originality, but that matters little I
with such a superlative cast, good |
direction, and smooth photography, j
Marjorie Flambeau and Lewis !
Stone stand out in the supporting j
group, and Garbo plus Montgomery j
do their best work in a long time. ,
Laurel and Hardy in another of '
their worthy comedies round out j
the bill. —J. T.
