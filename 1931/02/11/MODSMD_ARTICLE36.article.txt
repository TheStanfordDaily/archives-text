### 
contemporary literary doaks who
think they know a lot about it com
plain that cabbages consists largely
of long blank lines we mean dashes
so today we are going to be a little
dumber than usual and leave every
thing out but the words unless
there is some objection to those too
there used to be a cabbages
who was also heavyweight
champion of (he basketball pa
vilion and when anyone ob
jected to what he wrote and he
would say what thejiell kid the
devil he would say where do
you get off and flex his strong
right muscle and the mob would
be stilled
now they are all distilled to start
out with but that doesn't rmike
much difference we always pre
ferred killing with a bowie knife
ourselves
we wished for a sure and.sudden
means of execution when we looked
at the caricature the visiting artist
did of our editorial profile espe
cially the chin looked like a lop
sided pin-cushion what did you
think of yours that would be a swell

idea for another all campus inter
view if the betas and all the girls
who had their portraits made dur
ing rushing season would be honest
about it yeah
some officious soul made a mis
take and sent us up in the womens
club house to have a picture taken
and we suddenly noticed a bronze
ywca sign on the stairway with an
arrow pointing straight up they say
that is a new sign proving that it
is an uplifting organization anyhow
il is a sign of progress congratula
tions
the psychology department is
worried they have always bad a
question box left in a conven
ient place so their students
could ask and learn and now
someone has gone and stolen
the box they don't mind much
not having to answer dumb
sophomores but they need the
box to keep white rats in have
a heart kid have a heart
there was another muddy basket
hall game that is a subtle comment
and we don't believe in sarcasm but
you should be told what goes on no
matter what it costs us
according to the daily they are
finishing excavating for the new
gates on palm drive what do the
expect to find another pot of
gold or a donation from an
anonymous alum maybe
and we will finish with one para
graph that really needs mysterious
dashes but the public must be

contemporary literary doaks who
think they know a lot about it com
plain that cabbages consists largely
of long blank lines we mean dashes
so today we are going to be a little
dumber than usual and leave every
thing out but the words unless
there is some objection to those too
there used to be a cabbages
who was also heavyweight
champion of (he basketball pa
vilion and when anyone ob
jected to what he wrote and he
would say what thejiell kid the
devil he would say where do
you get off and flex his strong
right muscle and the mob would

ferred killing with a bowie knife
ourselves

idea for another all campus inter
view if the betas and all the girls
