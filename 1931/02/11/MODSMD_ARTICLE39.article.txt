Fraternities at the University of
Illinois have adopted a policy of hir
ing tutors to aid the scholastic
standing of their members.
Greek letter societies have al
ways been good training
grounds for bull tossing and
beer busting—but now it seems
that book cracking is to be
added to the list.
Dances are termed "crawls" at
the University of Oregon. Dances
often degenerate into "shoves,"
merry-go-rounds, race tracks, shin
digs, and bumping frolics—crawls,
never!

Students at the University of
Columbia retaliated at exam-giving
professors by testing the knowledge
of professors by giving 53 members
of the faculty some student-pro
duced mid-terms.

Needless to say, not one faculty
member passed. The students should
not be elated because even fools
can ask questions that no-so-wise
men cannot answer.

Advertising pays! A new student
at the University of Minnesota
posted a notice on the school bul
letin board asking for a good-look-
I ing co-ed to call his home as he
reeded a partner for the Junior Ball,
i He demanded the woman be a good
dancer.

the P.O. bulletin board: Wanted, one

less than 119—height five feet six
inches—weight not to exceed 123
pounds—none who do not possess
red (or black) roadsters need apply.
A student fell asleep in a class at

the University of Oregon. The pro
fessor Stopped the lecture and
placed a dunce cap on the slumber
ing man—much to the amusement
of the rest of the class.

tion would have shown a little
more originality if he placed a
night-cap on the reposing stu
dent.
