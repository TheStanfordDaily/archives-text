The Editor, Sir:
MORE CAMPUS NEWS
I suggest that the Daily print
fewer Associated Press dispatches
and concentrate on better coverage
of campus news. Every student who
is interested in world news reads
one or more metropolitan papers |
daily, and since these papers have :
the organization to cover such news
more ably Ihan any college paper, ;
the Daily might well present world
news only in synopsis form, and
give the students all of the news j
they want most and cannot get in j
any other way. To try to take the
place of the metropolitan papers, [
and thus avoid duplication, is futile, :
since the students will never forego ;
the large papers' features.
