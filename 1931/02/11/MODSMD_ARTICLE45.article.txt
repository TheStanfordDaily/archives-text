While tlio California basket
bail teams are nearing the home
stretch neck and neck in a race
for the 191)1 hoop title, things
are going quite differently in the
northern half of the Coast Con
ference. The Huskies from IT.l T .
of W. cinched the title last Sat
urday by taking a game from
the Oregon State quintet to put
their total at nine wins and
only one defeat.
It seems to be an old custom up
at that institution to turn out cham
pionship cage teams. This year's
triumph makes it three straight for
tho Purple and Gold. It's too bad
that the Coast Conference playoff is
going to be in the North this year,
for that Husky five always provides
thrill. Shooting from just any old
position on the floor seems to be an
effective specialty for them. They
have taken most of their contests
with anywhere around 40 points or
above to their credit.
If you want a line on the com
parative speed of the northern
half of the Conference this year,
here it is. Oregon State is now
in third place, and when you
recall that that outfit played
havoc with several highly es
teemed Bay Region teams on a
barnstorming trip during the
Christinas vacation, you cannot
help but wonder just liovv the
southern contender for Coast
honors will fare this season.
Losing only to the U. of S.F.. and
that in their last appearance when
several of the regulars were sick
and unable to play, the barnstormers
downed the league-leading Bears,
Olympic Club, Rossi Florists, and
the Y.M.I. Not a bacl record, but
still the Beavers can rate no better
than third. Fast company, we would
say.
Though the Big Meet is stiil
some weeks away, California's
own Brick Morse, writing in
the columns of the Call-Bul
letin, is evidently beginning
early to smooth over the inevi
table disaster which faces the
Bears when they meet the In
dians on the oval. lie has ac
tually conceded that Stanford
will win the affair. Even from
Morse, that, statement should
hardly startle "Dink Temple
ton.
Perhaps Brick has noticed that,
among other things, the Indians at
this early date have no less than
three' dash men who have clipped
even time in the hundred. The ad
dition of "Bangs" Eastman, Nellie
Gray, and a few others to this sea
son's oval squad may have some
thing to do with his prediction. Re
membering that trouncing the Bears
took last year after Morse end
others had warned the fans that
Stanford supremacy would
hesitates to hazard a guess at what
will happen next April.
Rothert has just established a
record for the shotput in New
Zealand with a heave of 4!) feet
4 inches. Wonder what the na
tives would have thought had
the incomparable Harlow tossed
the iron ball out past the 52-
foot mark, as he did in the Sta
dium last year? â€”Crawford.
