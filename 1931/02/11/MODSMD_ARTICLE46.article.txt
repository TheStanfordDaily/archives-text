# RAIN HALT'S FROSH NINE PRACTICE FOR SATURDAY'S CLASH
## 
### 
Rain put a temporary halt to the
Stanford frosh nine's preparations
or its clash with the Berkeley High
school squad of sluggers next Sat
urday.
The Stanford babes may not win
1 flock of games this season but if
hey play all their clashes with the
;pirit of last Saturday's melee, they
,vill have the crowd pulling for
hem. Their runs came through
inched hits in the third and fourth
linings, with Stan Anderson and
Goldman furnishing a good deal of
he power. The thirteenth inning
â€¢ally came at a crucial moment to
ie the game up in a bag.
California's Bear Cubs inaugu
atod their season in the right spirit
vith a win over a hustling Arm
trong Business College outfit by a
to 4 count. The Indians' first clash
vith the California diamond artists
vill take place on April 4 at Cali
ornia and the Redmen will have to
>ut on some steam if they expect
:> reverse the decision in last year's
cries, when Stanford dronped two
ut of the three 'tames to the Bears.
