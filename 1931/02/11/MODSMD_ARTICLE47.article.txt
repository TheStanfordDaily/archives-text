# Card Yearlings Down Santa Clara Frosh, 31-25
## TOPPING STARS IN FAST, HARD GAME; IS HIGH-POINT MAN Erratic Officiating Slows Play; Broncos Make Initial Tallies 
### Lowell Cox 
After training for a week in the
hospital, Keith Topping stole ihc
show in last night's freshman game
with the powerful Santa Clara
yearling hoopsters, by being the
principal factor in a 31 to 25 Stan
ford victory.
Not only playing his usual fine
offensive game, Topping was a de
mon on defense, breaking up many
Bronco ptays before they started,
and more than once turning Santa
Clara scoring attemots into tallies
for the Stanford babes.
The game was a rough-and-tum
ble affair from the opening tip-off
to the final gun, with impartial but
erratic officiating marring the play.
Broncos Score First
Santa Clara got off to an early
start with a free throw and a field
goal to their credit before the In
dian frosh could score. A perfect
throw-in play with Wright sinking
the basket and a follow shot soon
after by Jenkins gave the babes
their start, and once on their way
they clung desperately to a small
lead throughout the remainder of
the game.
Half time found Stanford leading,
17 to 9, but a Santa Clara rally
in the early stages of the second
period brought the Broncos to with
in a basket of a tie, 19 to 21.
Here Topping and Packard took
the situation in hand, and aithough
a succession of free throws kept the
visitors in the running, Stanford had
a safe six-point margin at the gun.
Frosh Defense Strong
A defense that wavered only at
rare moments aided Coach John
Bunn's yearlings in stopping the
rough and ready invaders. Most of
the time the Santa Clarans were
forced to resort to long shots, being
unable to work the ball under the
basket.
Something of a record was hung
up in miscalled fouls, with gal
leries on both sides of the floor
continually raging at the referee.
Topping, who received a big. hand
when he left the floor before the
end of the game, accounted for 13
tallies and high-point honors. He
was closely trailed by Packard with
10.
For Santa Clara the rangy Hunt
was the most dangerous performer,
scoring 10 points and getting the
tip-off about half of the time.
