# EASTON, GLEDHILL PLAY TOGETHER IN DOUBLES TOURNEY
## 
### 
As teams for the doubles tennis
ladder are announced, Ted Easton
1 and Keith Gledhill appear to be the
, strongest contenders for first posi
tion. These two stars have paired
together despite the fact that Gled
hill recently won the Univer.sUy
doubles championship with Joe
Coughlin as a partner, defeating
Easton and Chuck Weesner.
However, this combination will
encounter tough opposition in the
â–  persons of Joe Coughlin and Harry
Plymire, ranking number three and
four, respectively. Other teams
seeking honors on the ladder are
Phil Niederauer and Wilbur Cox,
Chuck Weesner and Bob Forbes,
1 Trow Stephens and Hubert Butle' - ,
Kclsey Petterson and John Gordon,
and Howard Blethen and Ray Ed-
I wards.
I No additions have been made to
the freshman entrants, Otis and
Ellis, Shwayder and Bogan, and
Sheahan and Wright being the only
participants thus far. No singles
ladder matches were played yester
day on account of the rain.
