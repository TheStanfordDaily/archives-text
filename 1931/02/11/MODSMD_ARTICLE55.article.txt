freshman divot diggers will leave
the campus tonight to compete with
the cream of college talent Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday over the
championship Pebble Beach course.
Since Stanford does not give offi
cial recognition to the tournament,

Mi rough their own decision, and
will pay their own expenses.

clude the entire ten-man varsity
team, are as follows: Malcolm Mac-
Naughton, Warner Edmonds, Her

handicap higher than seven, and
MacNaughton's is set at three on

Card Prospects Good
This coast-famous star also holds
the record on the local pasture with

somes of Farm divoteers chalked
up over the week-end in negotiat
ing 18 holes with a best ball of 64.

For th£ freshmen, Seaver and

nationally known, both having
reached the semi-finals of national
amateur championship competition
Within the past two years.
