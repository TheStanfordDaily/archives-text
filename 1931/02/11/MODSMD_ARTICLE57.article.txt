### Fritz Goodwin 
Mark Kai-Kee, Jim Kelley, and
Hugh Keenan will break into the
Indian lineup Friday night when
• Coach Harry Maloney's varsity
i boxers take on the California Ag
! gies at Davis.
These three men, who have all
been working out regularly this j
! season, will replace Yuji Imai, Dick !
Miller, and Gordon Gilbert on the
! Stanford card. Maloney plans to in- i
i ject the new boxers into the Davis I
j mixup in order that they may gain j
j competitive experience, preparing j
j them for entry in the California i
| matches if necessary.
The complete Stanford lineup at j
l Davis will be Kai-Kee, bantam;
Fred Glover, feather; Vance Rogers, j
lightweight; Kelley, welter; Fred i
Johnson, middleweight, captain: ,
Keenan,. light-heavy; and eilher
! Paul Targhetta or Bill Harding, i
heavyweight.
Harding May Box
i Harding has been taking it easy
j since the University championship
j bouts two weeks ago, when his nose
| was injured by the punishing left ;
; jab of Ben Palamountain in the
■ heavyweight final. In case Harding
' is able to go Friday night, he will
: replace Targhetta, who put up a
; game fight in a wild, four-round
battle with Nevada's heavyweight
| last Thursday.
Kai-Kee has shown himself a fast !
and clever bantamweight in varsity ,
practice sessions. He lost the Uni- ;
versify title to Imai in a bout which
; showed him in every department al
l-most the equal of his more experi
i enced opponent. With the assign
! ment at Davis behind him, Kai-Kee
! should be even more valuable to
I the squad.
Kelley Shows Promise
Jim Kelley is a good, straight
punching welter who showed prom
i ise in a preliminary match against
! Nevada. Although he is not in the
class of Miller, he should make a
tough customer .for the Aggie welter
I candidate.
Keenan has already tasted varsity
competition in intercollegiate
i matches last year. He was beaten
i out for University honors in the

light-heavy division by Gilbert, bui
he is a consistent, fast boxer who
has always given a good account
' of Mr. Keenan in the ring.
Maloney plans to take Gilbert,
Fred Gist, Don Frick, and Jim Bell
; to Davis to fight in a series of pre
liminary exhibition bouts. At this
| afternoon's practice, all the varsity
; battlers will tangle with their team
i mates in one-round bouts.

■ heavyweight final. In case Harding
' is able to go Friday night, he will

Kai-Kee has shown himself a fast !
and clever bantamweight in varsity ,
practice sessions. He lost the Uni- ;
versify title to Imai in a bout which
; showed him in every department al
l-most the equal of his more experi
i enced opponent. With the assign
! ment at Davis behind him, Kai-Kee
! should be even more valuable to
I the squad.
Kelley Shows Promise
Jim Kelley is a good, straight
punching welter who showed prom
i ise in a preliminary match against
! Nevada. Although he is not in the
class of Miller, he should make a
tough customer .for the Aggie welter
I candidate.
Keenan has already tasted varsity
competition in intercollegiate
i matches last year. He was beaten
i out for University honors in the

light-heavy division by Gilbert, bui
he is a consistent, fast boxer who
has always given a good account
' of Mr. Keenan in the ring.

i ject the new boxers into the Davis I
