' pendent baseball team which will
i oppose the Stanford nine today at
\ 3:15 o'clock on the local diamond
j for the Farm's third ball of
' the current season. Harry Wolter
; has selected Eddie and Pihl as the
! starting battery for the Indians.
Two members of the St. Louis
| Browns, Bettencourt and Kress, will
■ cavort about the glorious green
I sward for the trans-bay semi-pro
j outfit in today's encounter. Fans
will be afforded on interesting
chance for a comparison of the vari
j ous American League clubs by
; judging the representatives of the
I Browns with those of Detroit and
i Washington, the last two having
! performed last week with the
i Kenealy Seals.
liuss Makes Debut
Wolter plans to alternate Puiss
j and Dixon in the hotly contested
| right field berth. Russ, a newcomer
| to the varsity ranks, has come up
! rapidly since practice began this
! quarter and may prove to be the
! "fair-haired boy" for the position.
' The first baptism of fire will give
| a good indication of what Russ is
i capable.
Pihl, Miller, and Hardy will all
' get a try at ihe receiving end of
i the battery, while Eddie and Mislap
| will take over the hurling assign
| ment for the Indians. For the first
■ time in several seasons Wolter has
J several men for the catching posi
i tion, and at present no regular can
! be picked from the candidates.
