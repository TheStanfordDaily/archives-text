# Independents Dangerous
## 
### 
The Berkeley Independents came
to the Farm last season under the
i title of Lee's Haberdashers and
i were taken down by the Indians by
the generous margin of 10-2. How
ever, with any sort of pitching a
team with so much potential base
| ball knowledge as the Independents,
' is always dangerous.
