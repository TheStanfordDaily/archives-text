Over seventy students had made
appointments yesterday >afternoon
with Miss Ruth Tracksell, of the
service, for interviews with Means.
On being questioned yesterday,
Means said, "General Electric rep
resentatives visit every engineering
school in the country and many of
the arts colleges each year. We se
lect students who show promise and
put them through a period of train
ing, after which they enter the
company. Mechanical and electrical
engineers are first in numbers, but
we also take chemical engineers,
physicists, chemists, and commerce
course graduates. General Electric
maintains seven training schools
throughout the country, with head
quarters at Schenectady."

Means's visit is his fifth to Stan
