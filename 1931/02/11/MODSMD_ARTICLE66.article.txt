# MURDERING DOGS EVADING JUSTICE ESCAPE MASTERS
## 
### 
ARIGINALLY the police dog
was a sort of right-hand
man to the majesty of the law,
but today two of them arc be
ing hunted down by their for
mer masters after killing a per
fectly harmless but neverthe
less pedigreed fox-terrier pup.
If you like the idea of money
clinking around in your pock
ets and at the same time hap
pen to find these two terrors,
turn them in to Fred Frehe,
campus officer, with a word of
persuasion. He might be tempt
ed. although no promise is
made.
At the same time the police
are keeping a strict watch out
for all stray dogs, especially
those with murderous instincts.
