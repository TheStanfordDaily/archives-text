# BRIDGE BILL WAITS PASSAGE BY HOUSE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10. (/P)â€”A
single Congressional barrier, passage
by the House, stood tonight ahead
of legislation to permit construction
of a bridge across San Francisco
Bay. The Senate passed the' Johnson
bill today to authorize the bridge.
The controversy is one of the old
disputes that has harrassed the com
mittees for years. Reams of evidence
have been submitted in past hear
ings presenting contentions for and
against the legislation.
The Navy was one of the most
vigorous opponents to it. In the past
it had argued such a structure
would interfere with passage to and
from its anchorage in the bay.
