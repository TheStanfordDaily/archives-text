//I Profits 1931
Iln 1921 business conditions were
much as they are today. Then,
some companies decreased their
advertising budget to cut ex
penses; others increased their ad
vertising to offset the deprecia
tion in buying.
I Statistics compiled by the Curtis
I Publishing Co. show that thirty
companies that increased their
advertising made a steady gain in
profits each year. Forty-six firms
h which reduced their advertising
budget showed no actual gain in
profits until 1924. These were
Iw all major companies.
Conditions now are very similar
I to those of 1 921. Many firms are
reducing their advertising. A few
shrewd business men, however
realizing that money "saved" on
advertising is false economy—
I that it adds too great a penalty to
I their sales programs—are holding
their advertising to its normal
ft level. These men are facing no
I profit shrinkage.
There is a lesson to be learned in
|j the experience sketched. Do you
I fall in the latter group?— One
