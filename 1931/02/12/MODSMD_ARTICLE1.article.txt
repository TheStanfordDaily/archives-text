ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 11. (/R)
â€”The members of five leading
Greek letter fraternities at the Uni
versity of Michigan awaited word
tonight from university authorities
and the police regarding what ac
tion would be taken as a result of
a series of early morning liquor
raids on their houses.
The raids by local police resulted
in the appearance in justice court
today of 79 students found in the
houses. The raiders reported that
whiskey, gin, and beer were found
in the fraternity houses.
The fraternities raided were Phi
Delta Theta, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Theta Delta
Chi, and Kappa Sigma. The officers
said they found a total of 51 quarts
of whiskey, wine, and gin and a half
barrel of beer, distributed among
the five fraternity houses.
The 79 students, many of whom
were leaders in campus affairs, were
released on their own recognizance
after appearing in justice court to
day. They were ordered to return
Friday.
University authorities headed by
President Ruthven went into con
ference today to determine what ac
tion should be taken. President
Ruthven issued a statement com
mending the police and stating that
the fraternities, while in a sense,
regarded as private dwellings, apart
from the university, would have to
face disciplinary action by both uni
versity and civil authoi*ities.
