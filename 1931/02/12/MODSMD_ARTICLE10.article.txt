# UNUSUAL CASE FOR MOOT COURT TRIAL BY LAW STUDENTS
## 
### 
Declared likely to be one of the
most interesting trials of the moot
court series now being held, an un
usual case, open to the public, will
be argued by law students tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in room 12.

Professor George E. Osborne, of
the Law School, will act as judge,
while John M. Cranston and Rob
ert A. Hume will take one side and
John P. Jennings and Adron A.
Bcene the other.

The case centers around a petition
for writ of habeas corpus to secure
the release from jail of a person in
carcerated for contempt of court
when he ignored an injunction re
straining him from thumbing his
nose at his neighbor. The proceed
ings, of an entirely fictitious nature,
have been forecasted by Ben C.
Duniway, president of the Law As
sociation, as of a most entertaining
nature.
