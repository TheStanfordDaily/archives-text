Trailing Encina 2W's quintet, 14-6,
with but 10 minutes to go, Delta
Chi's basketball team started a rally
in which luck and Karl Falk played
salient parts to win the game, 18-15
last night in the Encina Gymnasium.
Until this rally .started, the En
cina team had been capitalizing on
Delta Chi's slight overconfidence.
Under the guidance of Parmer Full
er, small forward with the knack of
being in the right place and the eye
to put the ball there, they worked
out a 7-6 lead at half.
Delta Chi Rallies
Furthermore they spurted at the
beginning of the second period to
practically put the game on ice at
14-6. Then the Delta Chi rally
started.
Brown was the chief offender
against the Encina cause. Twice he
let fly shots with absolutely no arch
from the suicide corner and twice
netted buckets. On the second of
these, the ball hit the side of the
hoop, and bounced twice before
rolling down through.

Karl Falk helped the Delta Chi
cause along with his three buckets;
so that the Delta Chi's caught and
passed their opponents just before
the finish. The victory clinched sec
ond place in League 1 for them.
Falk off Form
Despite these opportune buckets
Falk was decidedly off form. Pass
ing too much and being passed to
too little, he was also shooting in
too much of a hurry. He had al
most as many chances at the bucket
as he did in his team's last game,
when he scored 20 points, yet in this
one he tallied but 8.
In the only other game played
during the evening El Campo won a
close decision from Theta Chi Mi-] 4,
to keep their place as joint leader of
League IV along with Sequoia I,
whom they have yet to meet. Stad
ler was high point, man for the club
men with 8; Zuger for Theta Chi
with 9.
Games scheduled for tonight:
Los Arcos vs. Phi Kappa Psi in
the Pavilion at 7 o'clock.
Alpha Kappa Lambda vs. Phi Kap
pa Sigma in the gym at 7.
El Cuadro vs. Delta Kappa Epsi
lon in the Pavilion at 8.

netted buckets. On the second of
these, the ball hit the side of the
hoop, and bounced twice before
rolling down through.

Karl Falk helped the Delta Chi
cause along with his three buckets;
so that the Delta Chi's caught and
passed their opponents just before
the finish. The victory clinched sec
ond place in League 1 for them.
Falk off Form
Despite these opportune buckets
Falk was decidedly off form. Pass
ing too much and being passed to
too little, he was also shooting in
too much of a hurry. He had al
most as many chances at the bucket
as he did in his team's last game,
when he scored 20 points, yet in this
one he tallied but 8.
In the only other game played
during the evening El Campo won a
close decision from Theta Chi Mi-] 4,
to keep their place as joint leader of
League IV along with Sequoia I,
whom they have yet to meet. Stad
ler was high point, man for the club
men with 8; Zuger for Theta Chi
with 9.

Trailing Encina 2W's quintet, 14-6,
with but 10 minutes to go, Delta
Chi's basketball team started a rally
in which luck and Karl Falk played
salient parts to win the game, 18-15
last night in the Encina Gymnasium.
Until this rally .started, the En
cina team had been capitalizing on
Delta Chi's slight overconfidence.
Under the guidance of Parmer Full
er, small forward with the knack of
being in the right place and the eye
to put the ball there, they worked
out a 7-6 lead at half.
Delta Chi Rallies
Furthermore they spurted at the
beginning of the second period to
practically put the game on ice at
14-6. Then the Delta Chi rally
started.
Brown was the chief offender
against the Encina cause. Twice he
let fly shots with absolutely no arch
from the suicide corner and twice
netted buckets. On the second of
these, the ball hit the side of the
hoop, and bounced twice before
rolling down through.
