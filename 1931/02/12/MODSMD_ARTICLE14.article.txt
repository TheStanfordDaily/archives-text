# Registrar's Office Has 'Anglophobia' Symptoms
## 
### SHANNON ALLEN 
Mayor William (Big Bill) Thomp- '
! son of Chicago recently issued a
strong protest against the English
j influence in Chicago schools. He
| would be further excited were he
j to wander inadvertently into the
waiting room of the University
i Registration office in his present
j state of violent "anglophobia."
i The registration committee, appar
ently sensing the superiority of Eu
ropean culture, is attempting to in- (
1 fuse some of it into timid but as- '
piring candidates for admission and
I the hardened Stanford rough who
comes brazenly to the office.to drop
'some of these noxious and superflu
ous units with which a strict and
merciless Committee on Scholarship
| has so harshly laden him.
English Magazines
j The table in the waiting room of '

the Registration office is littered and
swamped with English magazines
from the well-known but. little ap
preciated "Punch" to bulkier and
more serious publications' such as
the "London Illustrated Review" and
"BrittaAia and Eve."
Investigation has revealed the fact
that the magazines were supplied by
Dr. Pearce Mitchell, University
registrar, who wished to lighten the
apprehensive misery of waiting ap
plicants.
Possible Results
The only thing that should worry
the registration department is in the
event that an Englishman should
enter Ihe room to apply for admis
sion to the University and leave
hastily under the fearful misappre
hension that he had accidentally
entered the waiting room of a den
tist "back in the old country."
