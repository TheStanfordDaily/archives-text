# Stanford Squad Meets L.A. Duo In Forensic Tilt
## Free Trade Is Non-Decision Debate Subject 
### 
A small but interested audience
heard Wayne A. Bannister and Jo
seph J. Wolf of the Stanford forensic
squad take the affirmative side in a
non-decision debate with Leonard
Janofsky and John Gabbert of Oc
cidetal College last night in the
Little Theatre on the question, "Re
solved, that the nations should adopt
a policy of free trade."
The Southern California debaters
spoke on the free trade question in
a number of universities on a 5,000-
mile debating tour. They both have
an impressive record of victories
and achievements on the speaking
platform, while the Cardinal repre
sentatives were without previous
Stanford debating experience. The
latter were coached by Leland T.
Chapin, public speaking instructor.
Free Trade Not Harmful
Bannister, first speaker for the
affirmative, contended that the prin
ciples of free trade are no more
harmful when applied to interna
tional trade than when applied to
interstate trade, and that a protec
tive tariff raises the cost of living
and the standard of living. He
said that the protective -tariff gives
an unfair advantage to manufac
turers with political influence.
The first. Occidental speaker, Gab
bert, maintained that free trade is
theoretically desirable, but imprac
ticable. He said that it would bring
the standard of living in all coun
tries down to the level of the lowest,

j because the more prosperous coun-
I tries would have to reduce their
wage scale to that of the other
' countries in order to compete suc
cesssfully. He pointed out that chaos
would reign during the transition
| period from i'ne present system to
that of fret trade, and that the cs
! tablishment of free trade would
cause depression and unemployment
| in many countries.
Tariff Wall Cause of War
Wolf of Stanford then spoke on
I behalf of free trade, saying that
I economic strife, because of the pro
tective tariffs, is resulting in na„-
tionalism and, war, while a policy
of free trade would coincide with
the present trend toward interna
tionalism and world peace. He
l stressed ihe fact that the situation
! must be looked at from the view
point. of world citizenship, rather
| than national citizenship.
| The second negative speaker, Jan
! ofsky, argued that free trade would
| jeopardize national security by
I making one nation too dependent on
! another. He contended that world
j peace can be attained only by mak
i ing every nation financially secure.
