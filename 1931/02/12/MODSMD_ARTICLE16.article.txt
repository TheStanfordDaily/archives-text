# Dr. Swain Requests Change In Proposed Honor Code Pledge
## Second Recommendation of Ex Committee Is Given Complete Disapproval from Administration on Grounds Faculty Should Not Be Involved 
### 
Kx Committee's recommendations for enforcement of the Honor
Code will be returned to that body today for revision, Acting-President
Robert E. Swain announced last night. Dr. Swain's announcement fol
lowed a conference with Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president, concerning the
; report of the Committee on Schedule and Examinations. The report was
on the Ex Committee's recommendations for requiring a signed pledge
1 from every student taking an examination that he had "neither given nor
received any assistance," and for requiring instructors to call the attention

Vof their classes to the existence of
| the Honor Code and to outline its
I principles.
I The Committee on Schedule and
Examinations reported to Dr. Swain
j that the first recommendation was
; not entirely feasible, since some
| work done in preparation for ex
! aminations is not necessarily indi
| vidual in its nature and collabora
! tion in its performance would not
I constitute dishonorable practice.
Pike Responds
In response to this objection, Pike
! declared last night that the Ex Com
j inittee would probably revise the
i wording of the pledge in such a way
! as to apply only to the examination
! itself and the individual work done
\ in preparation for it.
The Ex Committee's second
i recommendation received the com
; plete disapproval of the administra
j tion committee on the ground that
i the enforcement of the Honor Code
I rests with the students themselves,
and that the faculty should not be
i involved in this manner.
Pike indicated that the Ex Com
i mittee would abandon the second
; proposal.
Code Defended
Informed last night of Dr. Swain's
i action, Guido Caglieri, new chair
man of Men's Council, expressed
faith in the Honor Code and an
: nounced a continuance of the pres
i ent policy of strict enforcement,
j "We shall continue the firm stand
| in regard to the Honor Code," Cag-
I lieri said. "We are convinced of its
I use, especially because of the%f"act
that students have been furnishing
: information leading to convictions,
! since the recent wide publicity given
j the system, whereas formerly only
i professors ever reported violations."

Dr. Swain's action on the Code
was one of his first officiaJ moves
since his return from Washington
Saturday. He has been confined to
his bod with influenza since Sunday,
and yesterday was the first day he
spent at his office.

Pike Responds
In response to this objection, Pike
! declared last night that the Ex Com
j inittee would probably revise the
i wording of the pledge in such a way
! as to apply only to the examination
! itself and the individual work done
\ in preparation for it.
The Ex Committee's second
i recommendation received the com
; plete disapproval of the administra
j tion committee on the ground that
i the enforcement of the Honor Code
I rests with the students themselves,
and that the faculty should not be
i involved in this manner.
Pike indicated that the Ex Com
i mittee would abandon the second
; proposal.
Code Defended
Informed last night of Dr. Swain's
i action, Guido Caglieri, new chair
man of Men's Council, expressed
faith in the Honor Code and an
: nounced a continuance of the pres
i ent policy of strict enforcement,
j "We shall continue the firm stand
| in regard to the Honor Code," Cag-
I lieri said. "We are convinced of its
I use, especially because of the%f"act
that students have been furnishing
: information leading to convictions,
! since the recent wide publicity given
j the system, whereas formerly only
i professors ever reported violations."

Dr. Swain's action on the Code
was one of his first officiaJ moves
since his return from Washington
Saturday. He has been confined to
his bod with influenza since Sunday,
and yesterday was the first day he
spent at his office.
Kx Committee's recommendations for enforcement of the Honor
Code will be returned to that body today for revision, Acting-President
Robert E. Swain announced last night. Dr. Swain's announcement fol
lowed a conference with Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president, concerning the
; report of the Committee on Schedule and Examinations. The report was
on the Ex Committee's recommendations for requiring a signed pledge
1 from every student taking an examination that he had "neither given nor
received any assistance," and for requiring instructors to call the attention

Vof their classes to the existence of
| the Honor Code and to outline its
I principles.
I The Committee on Schedule and
Examinations reported to Dr. Swain
j that the first recommendation was
; not entirely feasible, since some
| work done in preparation for ex
! aminations is not necessarily indi
| vidual in its nature and collabora
! tion in its performance would not
I constitute dishonorable practice.
