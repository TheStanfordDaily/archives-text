# WORK ON GATEWAY ADVANCES SLOWLY; HINDERED BY RAIN
## 
### 
Work on the new Palm Drive
gateway is progressing slowly. The
excavations for the foundations are
being dug in hard root-matter
ground and the digging has been
further hindered by rain.

The sandstone which will be used
for the facing of the structure is of
a rare type being entirely free from
the dark brown streaks which char
acterises most standstones, accord
ing to Comptroller Almon E. Roth.
The search for the appropriate stone
was partly responsible for the long
delay between the announcement of
the proposed gateway and the actual
commencement of its construction.
