Patriotism, democracy, and sag
acity are the qualities admired in
heroes, if the names of schools are
any indication, Wr. W. C. Eells of
the School of Education said at an
open meeting of Pi Lambda Theta,
women's education fraternity, last
night in the Women's Clubhouse.
A quarter of the country's school
population is in schools named for
Lincoln, Washington, Franklin, Jef
ferson, Roosevelt, and others in the
order named, he said.
"Heroes' names have a truly in
spirational influence on the impres
sionable child," said Dr. Eells, who
advocated the naming of more
schools for women and pointed out
that only one per cent now have
women's names. "Thousands of chil
dren arc going to schools having
such names as No. 10 1-2. But a
school is more than brick and mor
tar; it has personality. Pupils in a
school named for Jefferson or Wil
son absorb the spirit of democracy
which the former helped create and
the latter perpetuated."
