# BRONC-BUSTING INDIAN GAGERS TAKE DAY OFF
## Price Works Bear Varsity Hard For Big Series Game Saturday FIRST STRINGS INTACT Cordry-Meade Question At Forward Undecided 
### Stewart Crawford 
Well satisfied with the showing of
his men in Tuesday night's victory
over the Bronco quintet, Coach John
Bunn held no practice for his cagers
yesterday. Since the first-stringers
played the entire contest with the*
visitors, he felt that they should
spend an afternoon away from the
court, to return for a couple of light
workouts today and tomorrow.

At the same time, word came from
the Bear camp that Nibs Price was
intending to put his Blue and Gold
hoopmen through their toughest
scrimmage of the week last night in
an attempt to perfect an attack which
would .down the Cardinals Saturday
night and even things up at one
game apiece.
Bears in Good Shape
The Bears played their second
and third-string outfits against the
Athens Club five Tuesday night, and
consequently the varsity men were
in condition for the strenuous prac
tice.
At the present time it. is a ques
tion whether Reggie Meade or Tom
Cordry will start at forward against
U.C. The latter fell into a slump
against the Trojans last week, and
Meade's sterling performance after
replacing him seems to have caught
the coach's eye. The fact that Reg
gie started with the first-string five
against the Broncs Tuesday further
substantiates this contention,
liintaia a Bulwark
Rudy Rintala's defensive work,
which Bunn claims was almost per
fect against Santa Clara, should
cause the California forward trio of
Kintana, Davis, and Riede some
worry Saturday night. And if Mcf
fatt is "hot" enough to gaiher an
other six field goals, guards Vendt
and CofTield will have their work
cut out for them.
In reserve strength, the Indians
have it all over the invading Bear.
An Olympic Club quintet which
trounced a Blue and Gold â–  reserve
outfit, could do no better than tie
the Cardinal second-string later in
the season.
