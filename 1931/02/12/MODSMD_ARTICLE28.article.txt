PAN-HELLENIC SHOWING INITIATIVE
Sororily women nl Stanford may well he grateful to Ihe
presen I I'a n-l I<' II (mi it* body Iha I has I ia<l ini lialivo enough (o
agree lo a trial ol Heeling ils otlicers rather than having
llicm rotate.
! his spring quarter, a nominating committee composed
of the three oHicers and two members of I'an-l Icllenic, will 1
place before thai body three candidates, who, if accepted
bv it will become the three executives of the organization,
their exact positions, such as president, vice-president, and
secretary-treasurer, to be decided by the houses.
Willi only 20 members of Pan-Hellenic, a junior and
senior I roni each House, and a fourth of that number mem
bers of the nominating committee, there is bound lo be,
instead of chance rotation to a {food president, careful
choice ol what are known lo be ctlieient members and who,
when elected, will have the support of the body.
I'ppermost in the minds of the two houses who voted
against the plan and of any individuals opposed lo il, is the
question of inter-house vole trading. This is admittedly a
possible evil, but, even so, why not lake the risk for the sake '
of making Pau-I Icllenic a strong and vital organization.!
instead of one which is obviously weak and stumbling?
