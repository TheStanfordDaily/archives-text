# WASHINGTON'S PRESS CENSORSHIP
## 
### 
Al I lie I'liiversily of Washington, recently imposed fac
ulty censorship of the campus humor magazine may be
icsolved into the single censorship of the dean of the law
school. The Seattle university's administration mav well
pause for thought before il commits too great an authority
over a student publication into the hands of a single indi
vidual, even a learned lawyer.
We're not so much concerned with the fate of Washing
lon's (loltunns, for Ihe law dean may be a jolly old fellow,
appreciative of the many funny laws of these I nited Slates.
Rut the principle of placing a single outside individual in
control of a publication, whether student or not, is danger
ous. We hope the t'uiversily of Washington is fully cog
nizant of Ibis danger before it takes definitive action.
A parallel may be drawn in the action of the state legis
lature of Minnesota, normally a progressive commonwealth.
In 11)25, the legislature passed a newspaper "gag law" which
gave any district judge the authority lo suppress any publi
cation which in the judge's opinion printed "malicious,
scandalous, and defamatory matter." After live years' trial
of the law, during which Minnesotans saw the potential
danger of (lie lodging of such absolute discretionary power
in individual judges, there is now a movement in the legisla
ture for repeal of the "gag law."
Stanford is fortunate in having an unmuzzled press
which, free to publish what it sees lit, comports itself in a
manner worthy of ils responsibility.
