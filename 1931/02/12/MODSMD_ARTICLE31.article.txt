## DR. BAILEY SPEAKS ON THE HONOR CODE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Associated Students
of Stanford University:
I I have received your letter, signed
for you with a rubber stamp by
your hard-pressed executive, Mr. !
Pike, asking me to make a few :
1 well-chosen remarks about the ]
honor system on the occasion of my j
mid-terms. This task is beyond me; j
I hope you will patiently allow me I
to tell you why, in a number of j
1 reasons which for convenience may !
be numbered: (1)1 should he very !
much embarrassed; (2) I am not
sure what the honor system is; (3)
I am not sure of what you consider ;
cheating to be; (4) I hesitate to
place all (he responsibility on the !
shoulders of the students; (5) I de
cline to become exercised over a '
system which your councils do not ,
enforce.
(1) If I were to remind my sfcu- I
dents that cheating in examinations j
is improper, I should feel as ridicu- j
lous as if I had asked them to put j
on or take off articles of clothing, i
or to breathe through their nases. !
All students know from the first
years of school that examinations
are tests, or in other words, a
gambling game between teacher
and taught, in which fair play is
essential. The difficulty comes in
the zest with which the game is
played: some people enjoy playing
fair, and do so in spite of every
i thing, and others take their chief j
j delight in beating the dealer by any i
means possible; no amount of ad- j
: juration will change either side, and !
1 continuous talk reduces the dignity j
1 of the whole affair to a petty |
| squabble.
What Is The Honor Code?
(2) Every time I speak to anyone
on the subject, I hear a new idea
i of what the honor code is. I long
labored under the notion that it
was merely an affirmation of what
had been the custom at Stanford j
from long before my time: that one i
was assumed to be honest; that few J
professors stayed in a room during t
ail examination, or if so. read a book
and ignored (he class; that everyone
moved about easily, went out for a
smoke if he felt like it or walked
up and down in the cloisters to
compose an idea—it was merely un
derstood that one did not look up
information or talk upon the ques
tions. There were lib pledges, no
rules, no palaver. It was a very I
small student body, in which the'
seniors and juniors mingled with
; new students and passed the word
around.
Now, however, 1 am assured that
i the really important part of the I
Syste/fi is that everybody in a class
is to spy on everybody else during
: examinations, with the difficulty
1 that it is offensive to students of
good character, and I dare say, of
j fensive to many members of the
I faculty. It is to me. T. detest prigs,
and I haVe never had information
given me by any except prigs. '
| (Note: the information so far has
been invariably wrong.)
Faculty Interference
But if it is to work, we are told, j
1 the students must be absolutely re
sponsible; if the faculty interferes
| at all, the system breaks down; I ,
have even been assured that the j
professor should, ideally, ignore any ;
I trace of cheating unless it be
| brought to his attention by a stu- I
dent. What if a pair of the unre
generate manage their cheating so
! cleverly that their neighbors do not ,
I notice it, whereas the professor in
reading the papers, does? Is ha to !
overlook it? I once read two papers, I
stupidly alike, to class in order to 1
clear this Problem. The class was
annoyed and embarrassed at hav
ing to play jury, and found for the
defendants with a look at me which
said strongly, "What a ninny you
are, leaving your work for us to
attend to!" I agreed with them, rnd '
have never tried this laborious ful
filment since.
(3) What do you consider cheat
ing? All of your emphasis seems to j
be laid upon examinations, whereas j
there are much more serious phases
of trickery. Two or three students
! whispering during an examination i
are without doubt sharing informs
' lion —but in many cases they have
all studied together, and they are
perfectly innocent in thinking that
| their information is their common i
i property. Terror at a sudden blank- j
ness in the mind may cause one's
eyes to slither sideways at the next
man's paper, to release one from
the sick sensation that the world is
slipping.
Consider These Cases
Pressure of make-up work may j
create a panic, in which reason de- !
parts—not because one wants good
i grades, but because this incubus of
extra work must be got off: this
was the case of one we v/ill call j
Dinkelspill, son to a man high in
the administration; he had been ill, ,
and frantically sought to get some
! ideas for compositions missed, in
the encyclopedia. He quite sincerely
I did not realize that he had copied
paragraphs verbatim, with a phrase
or two of his own as introductions. ;
Even the best of prigs is sometimes j
, hustled into cheating!
A few quarters ago a stvulent of i
mine, whom we will call Sirivis, was
J very busy on a committee set to i
catch other students at misdemean
ors of another sort, with a printing j
of names and so on as penalty: he
became so very busy at this, in fact,
that he was about to be late in
writing a paper lor me. In order to
j keep his standing on a high level,
1 he used as his report several para- 1
I graphs from an old critic with a

vocabulary and syntax very dif
ferent from his own normal expres
sion. When 1 pointed this out, he
was regretful, and seemed to feel
that he had settled matters com
pletely by assuring me that it "went
against the grain to do it.' As he
had no humor, my remark that ol
couise his police. duties had pro
duced this refinement of feeling did
not register.
"Gilded Youth '
Are all of these performances
cheating? And what do you call
the form of it which I particularly
despise, and which you seem utterly
to overlook—the deliberate defiance
of standards from sheer laziness? 11
always occurs among our gilded
youth, the sort who come from pri
vate schools where Father's money
was all-powerful, and who assume
(properly, I am afraid) that it is so
here; they are usually good-natured,
almost invariably fat, proud of (heir
excessive shrewdness, existing at
college "to make friends and con
nections." and perfectly sure that a
little thing like cheating throughout
a whole composition or report class
is something exquisitely comic.
They have doubtless been brought
up on stories of how Guzzle Smith
got the best of ole Prof Whiskers
in '96—the usu;»l successful-alumnus
s;tate of mind. Take the case of fat
genial Hubert Butcher (who finally
made The Team), whose side-kick
look great pleasure in telling a party
the other day that all Hubie's com
positions in 1927 had been written
by Side-Kick, with sufficient vil
lainous spelling and bad syntax to
convince the prof that they were in
sooth Hubie's own product. I don't
know whether he did it for money
or not.
(4) The items just above being
considered, I can't see how the stu
dents, however they snoop, can be
completely responsible for Ihc sup
pression of cheating; in the long
run, most of it can only be detected
by the teacher, and often he is
helpless. There will always be a
certain amount of cheating which
goes of! successfully unpunished,
but two steps can reduce a common
practice of it (H such a state of
things exist) — severe penalties,
which should remain in the hands
of the student councils, and a great
er care on the part of the faculty
in assigning topics for reports and
in setting examinations.
And Now—The Faculty!
None of the communications which
I have seen so far has been so
uncivil as to lay any blame on the
faculty for indolence and careless
ness in this regard, but as a faculty
member it is permissible for me to
say that it is just here that the fac
culty should exercise a sense o! re
sponsibility—and sometimes fails to
do so. Niggling examinations on
petty fact are pure invitations to
cheating; the use of one type of ex
amination year after year> ditto;
I have heard of a professor who
used the blank-to-be-fillcd-in type
of examination, employing the same
sheets for two years running, and
who was astounded that members
of a certain house had perfect an
swers when no one else did.
I myself once &ave a yes and no
quiz in which I was so stupid as to
leave (he rhythm the same through
out —and found of course that sev
eral bright wits had caught it to
perfection, producing singularly
good papers on material they were
found to know nothing about; strong
criticism may be mode of the pro
fessor who issues sheets of blanks
to be filled in, and leaves the class
to fill them at leisure. Don't talk
about honor in such circumstances;
human nature is too strong, and in
the instinctive sense of antagonism
that exists always between professor
and class on the occasi6n of an ex
amination, these lazy modern types
of examination for over-large classes
invite the student to get the best of
ole Prof Whiskers. An analogy
would be the behavior of a dealer
at a gambling table who should
hand out to the players a few extra
aces, expecting the players "on
honor" not touse them.
Publish The Names
(5) However, in spite of all these
things, I might make a very touch
ing oration about cheating (in ex
aminations only, as you seem to
require!), taking some ten minutes
oIT the examination hour—if I had
any trust that your Councils would
exercise any firmness in dealing
with cases which I might send them,
and would administer jarring penal
ties, preferably with a cool publica
tion of names.
It has been sufficiently irritating
in the past, but the latest announce
ment that "a prominent student"
has been merely suspended for his
third breach of your honor system,

has made mo a complete cynic on
| the subject. I hear that the reason
i for this leniency was that the promi
| nent gentleman threatened suicide;
I you should have been firmer with
| him on the first offence—or did he
threaten suicide every time? That
• threat (never carried out) is a great
j weapon in the hands of the weak,
j 1 would rather hereafter send notice
j to the Daily that I have promised
a failure to Mr. John Binks Hun
-1 cump for obvious reasons, and t let
iit go at that; weak as that is, it
; might produce results faster than
j your methods.
The Real Remedy
I But if you really want to reduce
! (lie trouble in oiy midst, attack the
heart of the matter: see to it that
the administration bring about a
i reduction of the swarms of students
who overcrowd this place; see to it
that the departments have sufficient
funds to allow a reduction of these
j giant classes, where a man's sense
of individuality and responsibility
disappear as they do when he is
i uniformed as a private in the mob
called an army; see to it that ad
mission to the University be truly
\ selective, and failing that, repair the
damage by selecting a little your-
I selves. You have the power. Use it.
Your very humble servant,
Margery Bailey.
