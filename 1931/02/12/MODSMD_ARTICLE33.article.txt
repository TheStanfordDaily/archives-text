Nothing like boosting home prod
ucts, or even giving them undue
I mention out of turn, but Sequoia
Hall is being considerate enough of
the family pocketbook to offer spe
cial bargain rates for quantity at
• tendance at their hard-luck dance
] this week-end. There never was a
j surplus of women around Ibis place,
|so how can they dare advertise
j $1.98 for a bid, and $3.9G for two?
! Where's the other one coming from?
!
And today the Old Chappie Boy
J goes under public scrutiny, again,
! with daguerreotypes and lace paper
j bar-room paintings, after the true
| spirit of Valentine. That's one thing
| they never put on bargain sale,
i People might think there was a
! catch somewhere besides on the
| cover.
