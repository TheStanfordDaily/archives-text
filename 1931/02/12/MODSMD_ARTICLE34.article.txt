Students at the University of Mis
sissippi recently burned the gover
nor in effigy because he dismissed
several professors from the college
faculty.
Yes, and the students would
turn around and burn members
of the faculty in effigy if they
expelled several football stars.
Burning people in effigy is
about as useful as clenching
your fists in your pockets when
some six-footer wrinkles your
fender.
The University of Colorado is
waging a war to exterminate what
they term the "noisy library pest."
Why not build a social annex
to campus libraries where men
and women can go to smoke
cigarettes, gossip about the per
son at the next table, make
dates for the coming week-end,
and still have enough books
around to make them think they
are fulfilling their obligation to
the textbooks?
Coe College, like most department
stores, aims to please all its "cus
tomers." This university holds a
"Flunker's Frolic" at the end of each
academic year in honor and for the
special benefit of those students
who flunk out each year.
If it is a pleasure to leave this
college, then those that do not
fail deserve letters of condol
ence. If it is not a joy to leave
the university, then the English
custom of giving all Hunkers a
serious "funeral" procession to
the depot is more appropriate.
Willamette College lists date
making as one of the advantages of
attending Sunday chapel.
Date-making is an advantage
not only of attending chapel,
but of going to classes, standing
on library steps, getting mail,
drinking milk-shakes on the
campus, and pursuing every
and any college activity.
President Frank of the University
of Wisconsin claims that regular
sessions are a waste of time.
Well, that is one statement, at
least, of which the radical dean
can get full student support and
approval.
