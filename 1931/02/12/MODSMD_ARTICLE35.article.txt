IN OUR TIME—By Ernest Heming
way. Scribncr, N. Y. (At the
I'alo Alto Hook Shop.)
Sketches and short stories, bound
together by brief, brutal impres
sionistic incidents of war and bull
fights, form the now reprinted first
book of Ernest Hemingway. They
are backgrounds, experiments which
later became novels. But because
Hemingway's characteristic style is
brief, ruthless, and direct, the
shorter sketches, while incomplete,
contain more <<i' the vivid, grim hu- j
inanity than the novels developed
from them.
The keynote of Hemingway's
plan, which is vague at first, appears
suddenly. Nick, fishing in the
stream, expertly kills trout; men
shoot down men trying to advance |
over a "simply priceless barricade"'; i
bits of life suggest other incidents;
bits of human brutality expose hor
rors which are committed every day
without thought.
Those who have read "A Farewell
to Arms" will be interested to find j
its actual "first draft" in the "Very
Short Story." The brevity and cold
ly fatalistic ending is more impres
sive than that of the novel.
