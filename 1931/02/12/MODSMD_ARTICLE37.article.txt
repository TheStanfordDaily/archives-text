GOOD NEWS
According to Coach John
Runn, the press reports of the
Santa Clara hoop tussle failed
to show proper appreciation of
the fine style in which the In
dians performed. He was par
ticularly in disagreement with
scvcrai sports scribes who called
the game a "ragged alf air. The
coach characterized the play as
the best offense that Stanford
has shown yet this season.
Copious shots missed by the blond,
flashy Bronco forward, Nicholas,
Bunn attributes to the fact that the
Cardinal defense did not allow that
gentleman to get set. We had feared
thai the comparatively easy win
against Santa Clara would effect
anything but improvement in the
Indian state of mind before the im
portant Bear tussle which is just
three days away. But evidently
Tuesday night's affair is not to be
compared with the College of the
Pacific tilt which was undoubtedly
;i factor in throwing the Redshirts
oIT stride previous to the U.S.C.
disappointment.
In the Tiger contest, the Farm
cage men played poor ball to win;
;'.gainst the Broncs, they functioned
properly to gain victory. Though it
appeared to the average spectator
that the Santa Clarans were far be
low par, Bunn maintains that Stan
ford simply proved to be capable of
better ball than the visitors. From
this revelation of the man who
sh >uld know, we take new hope,
for the Indian quintet is the first
college team to have vanquished the
.strong Bronco outfit.
When John Bunn arrived on
the campus last September to
take over the direction of any
and all basketball at this insti
tution. folks informed him that
to make the season a success lie
had only to grab just one, just
one measly ball game from Nibs
Price's quintet. It had been a
long. lean five years, people,
since a redshirted team had
even threatened a Blue and
Gold five.
The trick has been turned, but
v/e |ust can l be satisfied with our
inch, and are now seeking the pro
verbial mile. With one U.C. victory
Tinder the bolt of the Indian and
two tilts yet to be played, a series
win appears far from impossible.
Both teams have improved since
the first overtime meeting, so pick
ing Cal for a pair of victories would
be no more justified than choosing
Stanford.
The safest bet would be to
predict a split, with each team
winning on its own court. When
two such venerable and staunch
Cardinal supporters as "Pop"
Warner and Trainer Wallace
Denny can't gel together in their
opinions as to who will triumph
down here Saturday night, you
can iiel it will be close.
A wager has been placed between
the Old Fox and his friend con
cerning he outcome of the tilt,
thought it has not been revealed
who is placing his money on which.
And if there is any inside dope
floating about the athletic plant,
these two should have it.
By the way. "Navy Bill" In
gram has announced that spring
grid practice at Berkeley will
begin shortly. It just goes to
show that the Army and Navy
never did gel along, since Ma
jor Fleming at West Point re
cently made it known this year
will see the discontinuance of
spring football workouts for the
soldiers. â€”Crawford.
