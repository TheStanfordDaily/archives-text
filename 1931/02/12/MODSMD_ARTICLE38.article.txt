# COUGHLIN'S ATTACK DEFEATS GLEDHILL IN SURPRISE UPSET
## 
### 
Even more rstounding than last
week's two tennis upsets is the sen
sational three-set victory of Joe
Coughlin over the hitherto seldom
beaten Gledhill yesterday. Abso
lutely at the top of his game,
Coughlin took the first set 0-2. But
with the second period Gledhill
changed his tactics, continually
hammering against his opponent's
backhand, and pulled through on
top. 9-7.
The third and deciding set, how
ever. saw Coughlin attack with vi
cious drives to vanquish his oppon
ent by the decisive score of six
games to three. Just as Easton, last
week, showed courage in winning
;>gainst such a heavily favored op
ponent, so Coughlin deserves every
hit of credit due him for continu
ally out-driving the former first
rn;in. He and Easton will soon meet
to determine the now unstable posi
tion of first man, but Easton is given
in edge to hold onto his title unless
he former fourth ranking player
hows form comparable to today's
•xhibition.
The only other varsity ladder
natch to be settled saw Kelsey Pet
erson rtain his tenth position
igainst John Gordon after a three
et struggle, 3-G, 6-3, 0-4.
Three freshman matches were
Jayed, one deciding the position of
lumber eight, George Torrence
novrd onto this rung by defeating
Gorman Wright 6-1, 7-5. Leighton
fohnson won over John Lohman
•«; ily (i-1, 0-1, to take fourteenth.
