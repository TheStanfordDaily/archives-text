# Baseball Varsity Bows To Semi-Pro Team, 5-0
## BERKELEY SCORES IN SECOND, THIRD INNING SLUGFESTS Indian Errors Help Shove Over Winning Tallies; Rallies Are Nipped 
### Tom Pockman 
A combination of big-leaguers, \
minor-leaguers, and bush-leaguers ;
proved too much for Stanford's
baseball varsity yesterday, and the |
Indians were whitewashed, 5-0, by !
the Berkeley Independents in nine !
innings of .slow baseball on the local
diamond.
After a tight squeeze in the first
canto, when J. Mellana, erstwhile
member of the Oakland ball club,
was nipped at the plate as he tried j
to stretch a triple into a homer, the j
visitors settled down to a bombard
ment in the next two frames.
Errors Allow Tallies
Errors by Delmas and Russ, cou
pled with a triple by Holmes, ac- i
counted for two tallies in the sec- |
ond, while successive hits by Mel- i
lana and Bettencourt, a Stanford j
misplay, and a two-bagger from j
Best *shoved three men across the j
platter.
The Indians attempted several ral- j
lies, but all of them fizzled out in- j
gloriously. Cook singled to start the ■
fourth, and after Philippi and Hunk- '
en had failed to produce basehits, J
Delmas connected with a fast one
for two bags. The double, however, j
was too short to bring in Cook all !
the way from first.
Indian Rallies Futile
Cook grabbed off another safety in '
the opening inning, but Philippi hit |
into double play. Campbell garnered |
a base hit in the seventh, but was |
unluckily stranded for the rest of
the period. Philippi reached the bags i
in the sixth canto, and likewise, ;
failed to make the circuit.
Many of the visiting players cavort
in the big ball parks. Bettencourt
and Kress are members of Ihe St.
Louis American League outfit, and
Cronin is a star of the Washington
Senators.
Cook was the big gun of the lo- 1
cals yesterday, gathering in two safe !
bingles out of four trips to the plat
ter. Coach Harry used three pitch
ers, Milsap and Caddel holding the
Independents' scoretess, while Eadie
allowed five of the visitors eight hit.s
as wel las the five runs.

Mellana. Struck out: By Lieber, 4: j
Milsap, 1; Caddel, 1. Base on balls: j
Off Lieber, 1; Milsap, 2: Eadie, 1. |
Credit victory to Lieber; charge de- j
feat to Eadie. Time: 1 hour, 50 min- ;
utes.
A combination of big-leaguers, \
minor-leaguers, and bush-leaguers ;
proved too much for Stanford's
baseball varsity yesterday, and the |
Indians were whitewashed, 5-0, by !
the Berkeley Independents in nine !
innings of .slow baseball on the local
diamond.
After a tight squeeze in the first
canto, when J. Mellana, erstwhile
member of the Oakland ball club,
was nipped at the plate as he tried j
to stretch a triple into a homer, the j
visitors settled down to a bombard
ment in the next two frames.
Errors Allow Tallies
Errors by Delmas and Russ, cou
pled with a triple by Holmes, ac- i
counted for two tallies in the sec- |
ond, while successive hits by Mel- i
lana and Bettencourt, a Stanford j
misplay, and a two-bagger from j
Best *shoved three men across the j
platter.
The Indians attempted several ral- j
lies, but all of them fizzled out in- j
gloriously. Cook singled to start the ■
fourth, and after Philippi and Hunk- '
en had failed to produce basehits, J
Delmas connected with a fast one
for two bags. The double, however, j
was too short to bring in Cook all !
the way from first.
Indian Rallies Futile
Cook grabbed off another safety in '
the opening inning, but Philippi hit |
into double play. Campbell garnered |
a base hit in the seventh, but was |
unluckily stranded for the rest of
the period. Philippi reached the bags i
in the sixth canto, and likewise, ;
failed to make the circuit.
Many of the visiting players cavort
in the big ball parks. Bettencourt
and Kress are members of Ihe St.
Louis American League outfit, and
Cronin is a star of the Washington
Senators.
Cook was the big gun of the lo- 1
cals yesterday, gathering in two safe !
bingles out of four trips to the plat
ter. Coach Harry used three pitch
ers, Milsap and Caddel holding the
Independents' scoretess, while Eadie
allowed five of the visitors eight hit.s
as wel las the five runs.

A combination of big-leaguers, \
minor-leaguers, and bush-leaguers ;
proved too much for Stanford's
baseball varsity yesterday, and the |
Indians were whitewashed, 5-0, by !
the Berkeley Independents in nine !
innings of .slow baseball on the local
diamond.
After a tight squeeze in the first
canto, when J. Mellana, erstwhile
member of the Oakland ball club,
was nipped at the plate as he tried j
to stretch a triple into a homer, the j
visitors settled down to a bombard
ment in the next two frames.
Errors Allow Tallies
Errors by Delmas and Russ, cou
pled with a triple by Holmes, ac- i
counted for two tallies in the sec- |
ond, while successive hits by Mel- i
lana and Bettencourt, a Stanford j
misplay, and a two-bagger from j
Best *shoved three men across the j
platter.
The Indians attempted several ral- j
lies, but all of them fizzled out in- j
gloriously. Cook singled to start the ■
fourth, and after Philippi and Hunk- '
en had failed to produce basehits, J
Delmas connected with a fast one
for two bags. The double, however, j
was too short to bring in Cook all !
the way from first.
Indian Rallies Futile
Cook grabbed off another safety in '
the opening inning, but Philippi hit |
into double play. Campbell garnered |
a base hit in the seventh, but was |
unluckily stranded for the rest of
the period. Philippi reached the bags i
in the sixth canto, and likewise, ;
failed to make the circuit.
Many of the visiting players cavort
in the big ball parks. Bettencourt
and Kress are members of Ihe St.
Louis American League outfit, and
Cronin is a star of the Washington
Senators.
