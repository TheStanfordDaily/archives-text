# A 						HARDY PERENNIAL
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The other night in Brooklyn a 32-
year-old man jumped over a wooden
crossbar held between two uprights
placed so high above the floor that
he could easily have put on a derby
hat and walked under the bar with
out touching it.

The man's name is Harold Os
born. He is a school teacher at Vir
ginia Polytechnical Institute, and
during the past 10 or 11 years he
has traveled about as far as eight
trips around the world to compete
in nearly 200 athletic meets. Osborn
holds the world's indoor (board)
record and the world's outdoor rec
ord. as well as the Olympic record,

and he also has, among his trophies,
a gold medal symbolic of first place
in the Olympic Decathlon champion
ship in 1924.
Has Unusual Ability
Now to jump over a horizontal
stick almost G feet 9 inches from the
ground requires certain ability not
possessed by the average person,
most assuredly, whether or not the
achievement has any bearing on the

human race in general or not.
The fact remains that Harold Os
born, the 32-year-old school teach
er, has jumped higher more times
than anyone else who ever lived,
and even though he is not the best
jumper in the world now, the fact
that he can still clear G feet G inches
(the Olympic record) *at the age of
32 speaks very well for his condi
tion and technique.
Best in 1924
Osborn's greatest year, of course,
was 1924. He set his world's record
of G feet 8 1 i inches in May, made
the Olympic team easily and won
two first places in Paris, setting
two new Olympic records. In 1928 he
was fifth in the high jump at Am
sterdam.
Osborn adopted the style of jump
ing made famous by Horine, of
Stanford, and Beeson, of the Uni
versity of California,' and surpassed
the marks of both of these Far-
Westerners. He sees no reason why
he should not do G-feet-4 when he
is 40.
