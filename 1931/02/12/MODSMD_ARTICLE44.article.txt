# JOHN SAUTER WINS HANDBALL TITLE IN UNIVERSITY SERIES
## 
### 
Winning easily in straight games. |
John Sauter yesterday defeated
Lincoln Rode for the University â– 
four-walled handball championship
on* the San Jose Y.M.C.A. court. I
Sauter. a veteran varsity player,
found little difficulty in disposing of
Rode by scores of 21-12 and 21-11.
Sauter's greater experience proved
the deciding factor in the games.
However, Rode, who proved the
"find" of the recent tournament,
extended Sauter several times dur
ing the match.
Both of the finalists will likely be
rated one and two on the varsity
squad that meets California in the
annual matches March 7.
Yesterday's final battle marked |
the end of one of the most sue- |
cessful All-University tournaments I
ever held. More than 30 men en- j
tered the contest and not one match >
was won by the default route.
Besides the coming meet with !
California, the annual doubles j
matches will take place early in |
April.
