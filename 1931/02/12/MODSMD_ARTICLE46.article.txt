Mermen competing in elimination
heats for" the annual intramural
swimming meet scheduled for *his

succeeded in chalking up two' new
intramural records, according to As
sistant Coach Myron Sprague.

Alfred Johnson of Delta Chi fin
ished the 100-yard free-style race
in the fast time of 1:02 minutes,
just 11 seconds better than the for
mer mark established by Fred Dietz
of Sequoia, while the Delta Upsilon
relay team bettered the former Phi
Sigma Kappa record of 2:OG minutes
for the 200-yard relay by five sec
onds. These marks will stand as
new records if they are not im
proved today, Sprague said.
An additional feature of today's
meet, which should draw a large
audience, was announced yesterday
when the coach declared that Pete
Desjardins, world champion diver
and holder of the 1928 Olympic-
Games title, will repeat the exhibi
tion he gave last week at the inter

from both the 10- and 30-foot
boards.
