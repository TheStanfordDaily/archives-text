# GRIDIRON LUMINARY JOINS FISTIC SQUAD AS HEAVYWEIGHT
## 
### 
Thomas "Bull" Driscoll, Stanford
gridiron luminary of the 1929 sea
son, is the latest to don the padded
gloves for Coach Harry Maloney's !
squad of varsity boxers. Driscoll
turned out for the first time yester
day afternoon, when he boxed two
rounds with Ed Dillon, former var
sity captain.
Driscoll is a heavyweight whose
brawn and drive made him an im
portant cog in Pop Warner's football
machine. Inside the ropes he should
develop into a first rate fistic bat- \
tier, if his performance yesterday
was any indication.
The entire squad engaged in a se
ries of one-round bouts yesterday,
by way of preparation for the
matches with the California Aggies
at Davis Friday night. Maloney had
his boxers paired with men one rung 1
above them on the weight ladder.
Paul Targhetta will be the Stan
ford entry in the heavyweight di
vision at Davis, Maloney announced,
as Bill Harding is still kept out of
competition by a nose injury. Dris
coll's appearance on the big boy
horizon may affect the choice for
this assignment, however, as Tar
ghetta has already participated in
one intercollegiate affair this season. I
