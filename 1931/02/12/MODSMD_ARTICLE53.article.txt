# Improved Babe Five To Meet Cubs Here
## Stanford Freshmen Show Improvement Since Last Game With Bear Cubs Three Weeks Ago 
### LOWELL COX 
PRESENTING a smoothly working offense and (lie tight est (lcfonso yet
I shown this season, the freshman hoopsters demonstrated by their :U-2, r >
vietor.v over Santa Clara Tuesday night that the> will give the California
yearlings a real battle when they meet in their second game Saturday.
I The Bear Cubs stopped the Farm quintet, :)!) to 22, at the Oakland audi-

•'torium throe weeks ago, hut they
twill luce a vastly improved team
ihis week.
Topping Aids Team
With Topping back on the squad
j and playing his best brand of basket
I ball, the chances of the frosh to
1 even the annual series are excellent.
lii spite oi" having been confim d
I to the hospital with injuries for a
! week, Topping stole the show against
| Santa Clara. Massey will probably
J be paired with him at forward Sat
: urday, and with Packard at center
i this will form a powerful offensive
j combination.
Maentz Disappointing
Maentz started in place of Massey
: against the Broncos, bui did not per
j form up to his capabilities. Pack
i ard was a little off form also, miss
! ing several easy chances under the
basket, but Coach John Bunn will
! probably smooth up his work by
! Saturday.
Jenkins played a splendid game at
j guard, his best of the year, while
| Wright performed well at the other
| guard post:
I Smith, who played throughout the
( first Cub game with a broken arm,
> :is of course missed. In spite of his
: injury, he played the best game of
j any Redshirt babe on the floor that
" ; night.
Cub Star Injured
■ i The loss of Smith is offset, how
| ever, by the injury of Eiffert, bril
; liant Cub forward. He broke his
I wrist in a game with the University
' : of San Francisco frosh, and will be
' out for the rest of the season.
Eiffert was the principal factor in
the Cub victory in the first Stanford
game, while on the other hand
Smith was the only player who kept
j the Farm quintet in the game at all.
I That Coach Bunn is intent on
) evening the babe series Saturday
; night is shown by the fact that al
' though he gave the varsity a rest
i yesterday, he put the frosh through
I their usual practice session.
