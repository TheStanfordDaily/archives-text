# UNEMPLOYED MEN SET TO WORK BY "CELLAR" OFFICIAL
## Student Force Of Workers To Remain In Employ, Announces Strauss 
### 
C. S. Strauss, manager of the
"Cellar division" of the Stanford
Union dining system, yesterday re
vealed a beneficent policy of his
organization that has been followed
for several weeks. Sensing the im
portance of the unemployment prob
lem throughout the country, Strauss
has been using his position to re
lieve it in Palo Alto. By maintain
ing a daily communication with the
local Comunity Chest, Strauss ar
ranges to give the especially needy
unemployed men two or three
hours' work during the part of the
day when students are unavailable.

It is not to be understood that
the customary policy of employing

students for the most part is to be
abandoned in favor of the new sys
tem, says Strauss. Students are si ill
being given first consideration for
work in addition to the necessary
regular staff; eight of them, for ex
ample, are behind the counter dur
ng the noon rush hour, and several
of them continue. throughout the
day. Only during the hours when
they can be most conveniently fitted
in without infringing on the stu
dents' prerogative, are unemployed
townsmen given work.
