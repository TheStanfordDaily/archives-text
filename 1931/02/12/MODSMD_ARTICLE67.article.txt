### 
FORT MYERS, Fla., Feb. 11. (/P)
j â€”Thomas A. Edison, 84 years old
i today, told reporters business has
! started a three-year trend toward
regaining the level of activity that
I prevailed before the depression.
The answer was to a question
; asking how long it will take the
j country to make the ascent.
Human endeavor can never con
; trol cycles of business depression
! and prosperity, the inventor added,
however. "It lies in the very nature
! of man," he said. "We will always
' have them."
As to the unemployment problem,
! Edison lelt he was unable to pre
scribe a remedy. After studying the
; question, he wrote:
"This question is several sizes too
large for me."
The interview was the first public
event of the celebration of Edison's
j birthday. In jovial humor and with
| a broad smile lighting his face under
| his thatch of snow-white hair, he
wrote answers to written questions
submitted previously by newspaper
men.
