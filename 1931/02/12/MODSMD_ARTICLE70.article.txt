BERKELEY, Feb. 11. (P.1.P.) —
| While they evince interest in the
plan of the University of Pennsyl
! vania for changing its control of
, athletics, officials of the University
j of California believe no change will
i come at the state institution.
"I am interested in the new plan
lof the University of Pennsylvania
i for the administration of physical
\ education as I am interested in any
| experiment which may reduce the
| over-emphasis of intercollegiate
j athletics and football particularly,"
■ said President R. G. Sproul.
"However, the system of the Uni
versity of California is based on
I control of intercollegiate athletics
,by the Associated Students. This
'■ system has worked well, in my
j opinion, and no change is contem
j plated. The students of the univer
! sity are in accord with the president
j as to the proper place of athletics
. in the life of the university and
| have bden most helpful in promot
| ing a sane program."
