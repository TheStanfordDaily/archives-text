### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12. (A 3 ) -
The Administration 'informed the
Senate today that the pending $20,-
000,000 drought loan fund could be
used by the farmer borrowers for
the purchase ■of food and clothing
if necessary for agricultural re
habilitation.
With this word from Secretary
Hyde the way was opened for adop
tion of the much-disputed compro
mise and notice was served by Sen
atory McNary, of Oregon, the as
sistant Republican leader, that he
would ask the Senate to stay in
session tomorrow until it had voted.
Borah in Favor
Senator Borah of Idaho, a leader
of the Republican independents, who
offered the resolution calling for the
interpretation of Secretary Hyde,
said the reply of the agriculture
chief was "clear enough, that there
is no prohibition against food."
Nevertheless there was no sign
tonight after another Democratic
outbreak that the opposition of some
of the Democrats and Republican
independents to the substitute for
the $25,000,000 Red Cross relief ap
propriation had subsided.
Republicans Confer
Hyde's statement was sent to the
Senate from Louisville. It followed
a series of conferences between
President Hoover and Senate Re
publican leaders.

Hyde reaffirmed the Administra
tion's contention that the purpose of
the loan fund was not for the pur
chase of food and supplies for the
farmers and that this relief was
being left to the Red Cross.
"On the other hand," he con
tinued, "it is my understanding that
the major purpose of this additional
legislation is in effect to restore the
weakened credit situation and that
when loans under any part of the
amendment are made to those who
have the securities indicated for that
purpose and for making the next
crop and for rehabilitation from the
drought, there could be no prohibi
tion against the proceeds of such
loans being used for food or other
supplies if they were necessary to
effect the purpose."
