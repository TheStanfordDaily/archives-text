Continuing to set the pace in
League 11, the intramural basketball
teams of Phi Kappa Sigma and Delta
Kappa Epsilon both won their fourth
straight games, the Phi Kaps from
the A.K.L.'s 24-12, the Dekes from
El Cuadro, 23-1, last night.
Phi Kappa Sigma had the most
difficult assignment of the two, and
in winning stamped themselves as
one of the better teams of the tour
nament. Held to a 12-0 score at the
end of tlie first half, they clinched
victory in the second by outscoring
the A.K.L.'s 12-3.
Woodworth, Lindesay Star
Causes were Eddie Woodworth,
who played a big part in his quin
tet's teamwork, and Lindesay, who
counted 10 points. Cornell of the
A.K.L.'s kept his team in the run
ning during the early part of the
contest with his three buckets.
As for the Dekes, they met in El
Cuadro a team with no offense and
a defense far from airtight. Despite
this, El Cuadro contributed two
startling incidents to the game. One
of their men broke the ice for the
Dekes by accidentally batting the
ball through his own hoop during a
melee under it, and their total of 1
point established a new low scoring
record for the season.
Phi Psi Never Pressed
Phi Kappa Psi went into the lead
in League V by virtue of their win
over Los Arcos. They were never
pressed, and during the last few
minutes sent their shock troops
for Guido Caglieri and Perelli-Mi
netti.
By trouncing Delta Upsilon, 19-4,
the Theta Delts moved into a tie for
third place in League 11, the same
one which the Phi Kaps and Dekes
are pacing. Romig, as usual, was the
big shot for the Theta Delts with 8
points. Incidentally, he made four
out of five fouls, and his team made
8 out of 12.

Woodworth, Lindesay Star
Causes were Eddie Woodworth,
who played a big part in his quin
tet's teamwork, and Lindesay, who
counted 10 points. Cornell of the
A.K.L.'s kept his team in the run
ning during the early part of the
contest with his three buckets.
As for the Dekes, they met in El
Cuadro a team with no offense and
a defense far from airtight. Despite
this, El Cuadro contributed two
startling incidents to the game. One
of their men broke the ice for the
Dekes by accidentally batting the
ball through his own hoop during a
melee under it, and their total of 1
point established a new low scoring
record for the season.
Phi Psi Never Pressed
Phi Kappa Psi went into the lead
in League V by virtue of their win
over Los Arcos. They were never
pressed, and during the last few
minutes sent their shock troops
for Guido Caglieri and Perelli-Mi
netti.
By trouncing Delta Upsilon, 19-4,
the Theta Delts moved into a tie for
third place in League 11, the same
one which the Phi Kaps and Dekes
are pacing. Romig, as usual, was the
big shot for the Theta Delts with 8
points. Incidentally, he made four
out of five fouls, and his team made
8 out of 12.
