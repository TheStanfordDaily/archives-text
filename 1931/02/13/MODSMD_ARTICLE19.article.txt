ters in "The Royal Family," which j
is to be presented to the campus
February 27, will have a large scope j
for her talents.

presentation.
Satire on Theatre
She is a woman who aspires to be j
rid of the petty artificial existence
of the stage and yet is so chained by j
those financially dependent upon her I
that all her decisions are in reality 1
dictated to her. That "man is a vic
tim of habit" is shown over and over '
in this satire of the theatrical world, j
Although Tony, Gwen and Julia
Cavendish all want to give up their
careers they return to the old rou
tine of "rehearsal, show; show, re- ;
hearsal."
The role of the 72-year-old actress,
Fanny Cavendish, which is to be I

played by Katherine Keho, is ex
tremely difficult and calls for dra
matic stage presence with many sig
nificant gestures. Although totally
different from any part, she has taken
before, Katherine Keho has shown
such talent in dramatics that she
should be capable of giving a realis
tic and outstanding performance.
Carter Has Lead
Nelson Carter known through his
work in numerous "Football Gai
ties" and as co-author of last year's
"Junior Opera" will bo playing as
Tony Cavendish his first authentic
lead in a campus production.
Tony is an amusing temperamental
fellow whose troubles based on his
fascination for women furnish some
of the most amusing scenes of the
comedy.
Gwen Cavendish characterized as
"the third generation of a family of
actors" will be acted by Caroline
Hall. Although as yet unexperi
enced in the dramatic field she has
taken part in several campus musi
cal shows.
