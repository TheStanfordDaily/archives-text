### 
1 ASHIN(»TON, Feb. 12. (/P) —The charge tiiat pressure from large oil
I companies influenced him in awarding patent to Colorado oil shale
lands was described today by Secretary Wilbur as a "flat falsehood."
That was the cabinet member's reply, made today before the Senate
Public Lands committee, to charge by Ralph S. Kelley, former field agent
of the Interior Department's general land office. Kelley, sitting across a
narrow table from the Interior Secretary, listened in silence as Wilbur

him of having "sold out"
Ito a newspaper "statements he
should have made to the depart-
I ment."
| "In passing upon oil shale patent
i applications," said Secretary Wil
| bur, "I can assure you there has
; been no ulterior motive.
"My action was not in any single !
! case influenced by any personal, 1
political, financial, or other interest I
'or pressure. The decisions of the
I general land office, the department, !
j and myself personally have been ,
based on merits as disclosed by the
i record.
Kclley Avoids Wilbur
"My office is and always has been !
; open to any man who has business
i there, including Kelley, who has
never entered it nor asked to. Ho
first saw me, so far as f know, at
| the House oil shale hearings two j
; weeks ago. Kelley has avoided exer- ,
J cising the right of coming to me.
"The statement that I have been
| subjected to any pressure or yielded
| to it is a flat falsehood."
Conservation Assured
The Secretary assured the com
mittee that "despite Kelley's non
! sense the oil and gas reserves of
! this nation will continue to be con
-1 served by this department as long j
| as I am Secretary but with regard
; for all equities and with respect for
statutory requirements."
Wilbur added that while Kelley
| was with the Land Office in Denver !
; he had written to the department
j letters that were "vague, egotistic,
; and full of charges containing by- j
perbole" but that the department
( had made every effort to discover
! whether any basis existed for his
! criticisms.
