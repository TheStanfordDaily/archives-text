# BEARS, INDIANS VIE TOMORROW IN HOOP CLASH
## Possible Chance For South Division Title Decided In This Contest REYNOLDS HIT BY FLU Cordry, Meade Battle For Forward Post 
### Jack Jernegan 
Tomorrow night an aroused Gol
den Boar will invade the stamping
grounds of the Stanford Indian, and
down in the Pavilion, citadcl of the
Redskin, John Bunn and his husky
bunch of savages are sharpening up
the tomahawk and practicing the
war whoop today with the sole ob
ject of preserving a momento >»f
that brilliantly hued Bear—to-wit,
his hide.
At 8 o'clock tomorrow evening the
long down-trodden Redskins hope
to get some more of the revenge
which they drank when they scalped
the Berkeley Bear last January 24.
May Win Series
If the Stanford basketball team
can defeat California in this second
game of the annual series, it will
accomplish something for which
Cardinal athletes have labored' in
vain through many weary years; it
will wiji a series from the ancient
rival across the bay.
And it has a darn good chance to
do just that thing. The Farm quintet
is 100 per cent better than it has
been in a long, long time; it has
the confidence of victory behind it;
and it is meeting a foe which is by
no means invincible, a foe that has
been beaten more than once this;
year, a foe, moreover, which has
lost its "Indian sign" that used to
jinx the sons of the Stanford Red.
Title at Stake
A possible cUance at the southern
division title lies at stake for both
teams in this contest. The Bears
have the best chance, but the In
dians are not out of the running. By
taking two more games from Cali
fornia while U.C.L.A. is defeating
U.S.C. at least once down in Los
Angeles the Cards can tie for first
honors.
This will mean a play-ofT, accord
ing to the new practice in the con
ference, and the winner of the
play-off will meet Washington,
northern division winner of the
play-off will meet Washington,
northern division winner, for the
Coast Conference championship.
This is contrary to the system used
in previous years, when the tied
team which had won its series with
the other partner in the tie was
awarded the title.
Reynolds' Condition
Being still undecided in the
Meade-Cordry dispute for a forward
position and somewhat doubtful of
the physical condition of Captain
Mike Reynolds, Coach John Bunn
would not announce a starting line
up yesterday. Rintala and Fawcett
are certain to start at guard, as is
Phil Moffatt at one forward post.
Reynolds reported a slight touch
of flu yesterday which may mean
that Bill Doub will start at center,
but Mike didn't look very sick in
the scrimmage which Bunn gave
the team. Cordry and Meade were
alternating during the practice, so
it looks like an even bet as to which
one will get the call.
California will use its regular
combination in the game; Kintana
and Davis, forwards; Read, center;
Coffield and Vendt, guards.

By 1!j;57 Missouri will have cx
pended $262,000,000 on tier state
highway system.

May Win Series
If the Stanford basketball team
can defeat California in this second
game of the annual series, it will
accomplish something for which
Cardinal athletes have labored' in
vain through many weary years; it
will wiji a series from the ancient
rival across the bay.
And it has a darn good chance to
do just that thing. The Farm quintet
is 100 per cent better than it has
been in a long, long time; it has
the confidence of victory behind it;
and it is meeting a foe which is by
no means invincible, a foe that has
been beaten more than once this;
year, a foe, moreover, which has
lost its "Indian sign" that used to
jinx the sons of the Stanford Red.
Title at Stake
A possible cUance at the southern
division title lies at stake for both
teams in this contest. The Bears
have the best chance, but the In
dians are not out of the running. By
taking two more games from Cali
fornia while U.C.L.A. is defeating
U.S.C. at least once down in Los
Angeles the Cards can tie for first
honors.
This will mean a play-ofT, accord
ing to the new practice in the con
ference, and the winner of the
play-off will meet Washington,
northern division winner of the
play-off will meet Washington,
northern division winner, for the
Coast Conference championship.
This is contrary to the system used
in previous years, when the tied
team which had won its series with
the other partner in the tie was
awarded the title.
Reynolds' Condition
Being still undecided in the
Meade-Cordry dispute for a forward
position and somewhat doubtful of
the physical condition of Captain
Mike Reynolds, Coach John Bunn
would not announce a starting line
up yesterday. Rintala and Fawcett
are certain to start at guard, as is
Phil Moffatt at one forward post.
Reynolds reported a slight touch
of flu yesterday which may mean
that Bill Doub will start at center,
but Mike didn't look very sick in
the scrimmage which Bunn gave
the team. Cordry and Meade were
alternating during the practice, so
it looks like an even bet as to which
one will get the call.
California will use its regular
combination in the game; Kintana
and Davis, forwards; Read, center;
Coffield and Vendt, guards.

By 1!j;57 Missouri will have cx
pended $262,000,000 on tier state
highway system.
Tomorrow night an aroused Gol
den Boar will invade the stamping
grounds of the Stanford Indian, and
down in the Pavilion, citadcl of the
Redskin, John Bunn and his husky
bunch of savages are sharpening up
the tomahawk and practicing the
war whoop today with the sole ob
ject of preserving a momento >»f
that brilliantly hued Bear—to-wit,
his hide.
At 8 o'clock tomorrow evening the
long down-trodden Redskins hope
to get some more of the revenge
which they drank when they scalped
the Berkeley Bear last January 24.
