•In response lo an Executive Committee letter mailed
lasl week lo faculty members asking thai lhey remind their
students of I lie Honor (lode on I lie occasion of mid-([iiarler;
examinations, Dr. Margery Bailey, of the Department of
1111•_»Iish, in yesterday's campus opinion column gave five 1
reasons tor not wishing to comply with this request.
C.hiet of these was that she declined lo become exer
cised over a system which the student councils do not en-1
force. Dr. Hailev wrote: "I might m?ke a very touching;
oration ahout cheating (in examinations only, as you seem
to require), taking some 10 minutes off the examination
hour if 1 had any trust that your Councils would exercise I
any lirmness in dealing with cases which 1 might send them
and would administer jarring penalties, preferably with a
cool publication of names."
Dr. Hailev suggested the only possible answer to the
question facing Stanford students quarter after quarter—
What's wrong with the Honor Code? when she declared
that it is not being enforced. And there is no denying that
is the truth. j
Occasional attempts, usually unsuccessful, have been!
made in the past lo prod the wavering, indecisive student
Councils into a little action and lo make of them a sem-j
blance of the judicial bodies they are supposed to repre
sent courts deciding every case impartially and firmly on j
its own merits.
Four of Hie five members now composing the Men's!
Council are newly elected. II is up lo them and to the mem- 1
hers ol" the Women's Council to insure the success of the.
Honor Code by enforcing its provisions concerning viola
lions. Publication of the names of convicted violators I
might aid materially the efforts of the Councils in securing j
stricter student observance of Ihe Code.
Enforcement of Ihe Code means punishment of vio-j
lalors. Their conduct merits nothing else.
