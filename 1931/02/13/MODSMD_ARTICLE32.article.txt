The ( Diversity at the present time is contemplating the
removal of the dial telephones in the halls because stu
dents, in the past six months, have made some #200 worth
of long-distance calls for which they have not paid.
Those dial telephones were installed for the conven
ience of men wishing to place a call after 10 o'clock at
night, at which hour the t niversity exchange closes. Stu
dents were especially cautioned not to make long distance
calls over these lines, but g to use the pay phones instead.
This request has been disregarded by a few, so the rest
will suffer with them. In addition, I Diversity officials an

phone company and the names of the defaulting students
will be turned over to Men's Council unless these students
inquire at the A.S.S.t ". oftice concerning their calls.
The spirit of which Stanford is so proud must be a
