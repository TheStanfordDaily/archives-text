THE CHALLENGE OF RUSSIA—
By Sherwood Eddy. Farrar and
Marchant, the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
When the largest country in the
world attempts the boldest experi
ment in world history, people will
talk, This book is the latest word
on the experiment, and from many
the reviewer has read, the most ade
quate.
Sherwood Eddy made six trips to
Russia, twice before the war and
again as recently as last year. He
apparently knows what he is writ
ing about. liis book is a most un
biased and interesting presentation
of a nation in metamorphosis, a new
social and economic order in the
Union of Socialistic Soviet Repub
lics which is changing the religion,
home life, ideals of 160,000,000 peo
ple, and which may sweep to far
thest peoples of the world. That is
"The Challenge of Russia."

THE REDLAKES—By Francis Brett
Young. Harpers, New York. 1930.
Much in the manner of Priestly
or Maugham is this book by Fran
cis Brett Young, another English
author.
In "The Redlakes," Young traces
the life of Jim Redlake from early
childhood, through Winchester,
youthful days in medical school, the-
World War as it was fought in
South Africa, and ends with his
marriage.
On this count, one might judge
the book devoid of originality. On
the contrary, the author offers new
angles, vivid personalities, and a
fascinating story. It is long, but
never drags; a book one hates to
put away until completely read. It
is essentially well-written, simple
but real, and proves the author to
have an amazing descriptive ability.

ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE — By
Andre Maurois.
Andre Maurois is a distinguished
biographer. But—if the "Atmosphere
of Love" is any criteria, he is step-

I ping out of his field when he at
• tempts subjective fiction.
As an outstanding example of
how unrestrained egotism and ex
cessive sentimentality can mar the
■ work of a really fine writer, this
book may have at least one claim
to your attention. Of course, no one
can quarrel with Maurois' style. His
! sentences are polished, his words
} fastidiously chosen. To this extent
! his book is a pleasure. Scarcely l'ur
j ther than this, howevex\
Maurois lays bare the gamut of
; the emotional experiences of an
esthete, on the cheerful assumption
that they nre vital, significant, and
j engrossing. They are not. They are
| quite ordinary. Half the book is
i taken up with the hero's first love,
who abandons him, and whom he
i stupidly continues to love. The other
[ half concerns the second love, who
I is constant and adoring, and who,
; of course, bores him to extinction.
The plot is negligible.
The admirers of "Ariel" and
| "Byron"—both of which are ad-
I mitledly excellent biographies —
j will be disappointed in the inferi
ority which stamps Maurois' latest
' novel. —M. L. R.

I
jNO LIMIT—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
1 Paramount's attempt to capitalize
|on Clara Bow's Calneva escapade
i reaches the screen as "No Limit,"
! now unreeling at the New Stanford.
It is not Clara at her best, and in
j spite of efforts to surround her with
i a good cast, is rather feeble. Stuart
Erwin is good in his usual dumb
| way, and Harry Green provokes a
| few laughs, but only glimpses of
l either are seen.
The story concerns a theatre
j usherette (Clara) who suddenly
finds herself in charge of a fashion
| able gambling apartment. There is a
villain (Norman Foster) who tries
to clean out the place, but he falls
i in love with the erstwhile usherette,
! and you can guess the rest.
It is to be hoped Paramount
j spares us a production based on the
I "Daisy" affair. -»-L. C.
