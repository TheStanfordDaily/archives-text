# Campus Opinion
## THANKFUL FOR UNEXPECTED HOPE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Either the Ex Committee is a j
group of engaging liars, or else it
is being generous to the point of
extinction. That was the genuinely
alarming dilemma which faced me
upon discovering the anouncemcnt
of the new Stanford Monthly in
yesterday's paper. After being nur
tured in the understanding that the
A.S.S.U. funds are in such a condi
tion that no further liabilities can
possibly be supported, and that the
entrance of an additional publica
tion into the struggle for advertis
ing support could not be permitted
by the present campus publications,
I could find utterly no meaning in >
the surprising announcement that i
the "Ex Committee Plans to Edit :
New Magazine."
However, perhaps the consistency I
and general acuteness of the Execu- ,
tive Committee is a matter of little |
importance. But the matter of a new ,
magazine, of which there is un- j
doubtedly a great need, is really i
quite momentous, and it is the na- !
ture of the magazine which is the ;
subject of the most significant criti- !
cism.
The announcement of the style of j
Ihe new periodical carried in yes- I
terday's Daily read like a veritable !
dirge. In each issue there will be
one article on a literary subject, one '

by an educator on a college student
problem, and then a section devoted
to the careers of prominent profes
sional men. How wonderfully ex
citing all that will be! It sounds like
a periodical for the purpose of pre
serving the meat and substance of '
all Tuesday evening lectures—and 1
that is not to question the value of
the Tuesday evening lpctures, either, i
but is only to suggest realistically j
the support which may be expected
from the students.
Though there is no indication of
who really betrays the sanity atti
tude which colors all Stanford of- i
ficialdom. The attitude of those '
within the magic circle seems to be j
that of extreme concern for the rest i
of us heathen—all their work is j
concerned with some sort of uplift- j
ing enlightenment. The magazine ,
appears to continue in the mission- j
ary spirit. Most of the space, nu- j
parently, will be devoted to the
mature judgments of successful men, i
and the only really unique function
which this magazine could perform,
that of publishing critical and liter
ary efforts of students, is to be prac
tically ignored.
However, criticism on the basis
of one report is unfair. We need a j
magazine; we cannot choose but be
thankful for this—this unexpected I
hope. —Guy Barker, j

tured in the understanding that the
A.S.S.U. funds are in such a condi
tion that no further liabilities can
possibly be supported, and that the
entrance of an additional publica
tion into the struggle for advertis
ing support could not be permitted
by the present campus publications,
I could find utterly no meaning in >
the surprising announcement that i
the "Ex Committee Plans to Edit :
New Magazine."
However, perhaps the consistency I
and general acuteness of the Execu- ,
tive Committee is a matter of little |
importance. But the matter of a new ,
magazine, of which there is un- j
doubtedly a great need, is really i
quite momentous, and it is the na- !
ture of the magazine which is the ;
subject of the most significant criti- !
cism.
The announcement of the style of j
Ihe new periodical carried in yes- I
terday's Daily read like a veritable !
dirge. In each issue there will be
one article on a literary subject, one '

by an educator on a college student
problem, and then a section devoted
to the careers of prominent profes
sional men. How wonderfully ex
citing all that will be! It sounds like
a periodical for the purpose of pre
serving the meat and substance of '
all Tuesday evening lectures—and 1
that is not to question the value of
the Tuesday evening lpctures, either, i
but is only to suggest realistically j
the support which may be expected
from the students.
Though there is no indication of
who really betrays the sanity atti
tude which colors all Stanford of- i
ficialdom. The attitude of those '
within the magic circle seems to be j
that of extreme concern for the rest i
of us heathen—all their work is j
concerned with some sort of uplift- j
ing enlightenment. The magazine ,
appears to continue in the mission- j
ary spirit. Most of the space, nu- j
parently, will be devoted to the
mature judgments of successful men, i
and the only really unique function
which this magazine could perform,
that of publishing critical and liter
ary efforts of students, is to be prac
tically ignored.
However, criticism on the basis
of one report is unfair. We need a j
magazine; we cannot choose but be
thankful for this—this unexpected I
hope. —Guy Barker, j
The Editor, Sir:
Either the Ex Committee is a j
group of engaging liars, or else it
is being generous to the point of
extinction. That was the genuinely
alarming dilemma which faced me
upon discovering the anouncemcnt
of the new Stanford Monthly in
yesterday's paper. After being nur
tured in the understanding that the
