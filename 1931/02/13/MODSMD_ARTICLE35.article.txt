# CABBAGES and Things..

We're back to the original black
omen day, with thirteen cats trail
ing thirteen fish mongers all through
the campus back-alleys. So far
j we've had no reports of fatal acci
| dents and only three minor calami
i ties, this morning (being alarm
j clock, roommate, eight o'clock).
This is the age of spirited
fearlessness, or else college stu
dents are just plain dumb. More
would-be brawls are scheduled
for tonight than any other
week-end so far this quarter.
If you'd all been brought up in
Massachusetts, too, you'd know
it wasn't safe to swear at a pro
fessor or make even polite faces
at traffic cops, before midnight,
today.
Apropos of the subject of crowded
sorority houses and campus dances-—
At a recent get-together of the
J jolly-up nature, one of the fairest
I fifty of the Gramma Kooky tong de-
I manded of her partner, "Who is that
| girl with the fuzzy hair, that Bob
1 is dancing with?" "Lord, Marian!
You ought to know. She's a Gramma
Cooky, too." "Funny .... I don't
| remember seeing her before. But
then, I'm living on the third floor,
i this year."
Just ask us, would we like to be
! part of a sweet united sisterhood
' like that, or would we?
And tomorrow they'll play
"Hearts and Flowers" over all
broadcasting stations, while ex
brute-husbands return home to re
ceive forgiveness, and funny fra
ternity fellows demand red coloring

lin their ginger ale, to add to the
i spirit of celebration. Who's volun
teering to send Cabbages a piece of
lace paper? or even a comic valen
tine will do. Sob. Snort. Cabbages
i sent a violent double-decked valen
i tine to a pretty girl, once, and got
! suspended from school. How was a
mere cabbage to remember to take
I the excess animals off the fly paper
| the thing was made of, before mail
| ing it? That cost a lot ... .
