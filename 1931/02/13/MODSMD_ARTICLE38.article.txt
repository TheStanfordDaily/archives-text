# SIDELINE SLANTS
## STILL A CHANCE 
### 
llovv is the title of the Coast
Conference basketball race de
cided in a case of a tie between
two teams? Especially pertinent
is that question to court fans
tins season, what with all four
outfits still holding a chance at
least to tie for the lead in num
ber of games won. But just ask
anyone around the Farm to en
lighten you on the matter, be he
B.A.C. sports mogul or philoso
phy major, and you will prob
ably remain in the dark.
Last year the Bears tied U.S.C.,
but waived a playoff, allowing the
Southern team the honor of meet
ing the Huskies from the North in
the const title series, and, incident
ally, of defeating them. Since the
U.C. five had lost its series to the
Trojans, followers of the court game
gathered that an unwritten agree
ment existed among graduate man
agers, giving the title, in case of a
deadlock, to the team that had de
feated its rival two out of three.
The last ruling on the subject was
made at the conference meeting of
March 1928. Notes from (his con
clave indicate that there shall be a
one-game playoff between two
quintets tied in percentage, to be
played a week following the last
scheduled game. The outfit which
had only one of the three tilts be
tween the schools on its home court
is to be host for the contest.
This year, with every quintet
trouncing each other aspirant,
it is a safe bet that if two insti
tutions end in a tie lor the title,
there WILL be a game to de
cide the championship. Coach
Bunn has indicated, at least,
that firs basketball team will not,
even if given the opportunity,
donate the southern half title
to anyone, regardless of how the
Indians fared against them in a
three-game series.
Thus the Cardinal quintet is still
very much in . the thick of a title
race in which anything can happen.
At present, the Bears and the Tro
jans are tied for the lead with four
wins and three defeats. For second
best, the Redshirts are in a deadlock
with the Bruins, at tnre victories
and four losses. Two California-
Stanford tussles remain, while
U.C.L.A. has a couple left with the
men of Troy.
Each team has a hope, though
two are but slender threads. To
tie, Caddy Works' Bruins must
grab two from the Trojans while
the Cardinals arc copping at
least one from the Blue and
Ciold. Bunn's cagers need two
triumphs over the Berkeley
lioopmen to stay in the race,
provided the Uclans can win at
ieost one from Southern Cali
fornia.
That the Indians can trounce Nibs
Price's five twice in a row does not
seem impossible. The stage is set
about right, with the redshirted
team in a fighting mood after the
ignominious showing in the South
last week. And if U.C.L.A. can take
care of its part of the assignment,
there si room for hwpe. If they don't,
U.S.C. v/ill walk off with title hon
ors, since we figure Stanford a cinch
1o take at least one from the Bears.
Though helpless to stop the
Trojans from winning their
panics, in an unlocked for man
ner the Indians have already in
fluenced the basketball odds be
tween the southern institutions.
II appears that Gardner, for
ward. and Capps, star guard for
U.S.C., are out of tomorrow
night's contest from injuries sus
tained last week while "easily"
trimming the Cardinals.
