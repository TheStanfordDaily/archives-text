# Indian, Bronco Nines To Cross Bats Tomorrow
## FIRST CONFERENCE TILT TO DEDICATE VARSITY DIAMOND Dan Johnson Will Start On Mound For Stanford; Lineups Named 
### Francis Lloyd 
Late yesterday the B.A.C. declared
Ralph Cook, star first baseman, in
eligible to compete because of his
scholastic standing after the mid
quarters. Spud Hardy, erstwhile
catcher, has been placed at first
base and will start the Santa Clara
game in that position.

With Dan Johnson on the mound,
the Indian varsity nine will open
its conference schedule and formally
dedicate the new Stanford baseball
park when it meets the battling
Santa Clara Broncos at 2:39 o'clock
Saturday afternoon.
Johnson showed to great advan
tage in his second start of the sea
son against the Athens Club. After
the star chucker got in the game in
the fourth inning, the clubmen
never got beyond second base. With
any kind of support from the Indian
willow wielders, Johnson should be j
credited with a victory tomorrow, j
Thustees, Officials Invited
The Trustees, members of fhc
Board of Athletic Control, and for
mer baseball captains of Stanford
have been sent invitations for the
dedication game. In all, more than
500 invitations were sent out.
It had been planned to have Dr.
Swain throw the first ball of "the
game, but owing to a recent attack
of influenza, it was thought unwise
for him to do so, according to Don !
Liebendorfer, director of athletic I
news. I
Wednesday's game with the f
Berkeley Independents only served |
to tighten the races for catcher and j
right field, the positions which have j
been bothering Coach Harry Wolter.
Starters at these posts will not be
named until game time.
Hardy, Pihl, and Miller are the
candidates for the receiving job,
while Dixon, Russ, Stine, and |
Woodworth are competing for the
privilege of gamboling in the right ;
garden.
Broncos Unknown Quantity i
The Santa Clara outfit has played i
but one game so far, losing last j
week to the S.P. nine, 9-5, which ,
makes them rather an unknown
quantity. If past teams are any cri- 1
terion from which to judge, how
ever, the Broncos may be expected
to offer plenty of competition. Coach
Walter l- The Great" Mails should
have developed a strong pitching
staff at the least.
Captain "Swede" Harper, who j
presides over the keystone sack, is 1
the individual star and most ex- >
perienced player on the team.
Thomas is expectcd to start on the 1
mound for the Mission aggregation, I
with Morey catching.
The lineups are as follows: Stan
ford, Dan Johnson, p; catcher, not
announced: Cook, lb; Philippi, 2b;
Dykes Johnson, 3b; Del mas, ss;
Hunken, If; Campbell, cf; right field,

Broncos Unknown Quantity i
The Santa Clara outfit has played i
but one game so far, losing last j
week to the S.P. nine, 9-5, which ,
makes them rather an unknown
quantity. If past teams are any cri- 1
terion from which to judge, how
ever, the Broncos may be expected
to offer plenty of competition. Coach
Walter l- The Great" Mails should
have developed a strong pitching
staff at the least.
Captain "Swede" Harper, who j
presides over the keystone sack, is 1
the individual star and most ex- >
perienced player on the team.
Thomas is expectcd to start on the 1
mound for the Mission aggregation, I
with Morey catching.
The lineups are as follows: Stan
ford, Dan Johnson, p; catcher, not
announced: Cook, lb; Philippi, 2b;
Dykes Johnson, 3b; Del mas, ss;
Hunken, If; Campbell, cf; right field,
not anonunced.
For Santa Clara: Thomas, p; j
Morey, c; Lee, lb; Harper, 2b; Stu- j
art, 3b; Murray, ss; Rowland, If: j
Long, cf; Farrell, rf.
Late yesterday the B.A.C. declared
Ralph Cook, star first baseman, in
eligible to compete because of his
scholastic standing after the mid
quarters. Spud Hardy, erstwhile
catcher, has been placed at first
base and will start the Santa Clara
game in that position.

With Dan Johnson on the mound,
the Indian varsity nine will open
its conference schedule and formally
dedicate the new Stanford baseball
park when it meets the battling
Santa Clara Broncos at 2:39 o'clock
Saturday afternoon.
Johnson showed to great advan
tage in his second start of the sea
son against the Athens Club. After
the star chucker got in the game in
the fourth inning, the clubmen
never got beyond second base. With
any kind of support from the Indian
willow wielders, Johnson should be j
credited with a victory tomorrow, j
Thustees, Officials Invited
The Trustees, members of fhc
Board of Athletic Control, and for
mer baseball captains of Stanford
have been sent invitations for the
dedication game. In all, more than
500 invitations were sent out.
It had been planned to have Dr.
Swain throw the first ball of "the
game, but owing to a recent attack
of influenza, it was thought unwise
for him to do so, according to Don !
Liebendorfer, director of athletic I
news. I
Wednesday's game with the f
Berkeley Independents only served |
to tighten the races for catcher and j
right field, the positions which have j
been bothering Coach Harry Wolter.
