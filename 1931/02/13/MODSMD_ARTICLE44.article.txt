# INDIAN SCRAPPERS TO CLASH TONIGHT WITH DAVIS SQUAD
## Maloney's Squad Favored To Repeat Victories Of Nevada Bouts 
### Fritz Goodwin 
With a boxing squad that at pres
ent appears to be the strongest ag
gregation of Stanford leather-push
ers in the last few seasons, Coach
Harry Maloney and Assistant Myron
Schall leave for Davis at 9 o'clock
this morning to match their proteges
tonight against the California Ag
gies.
Little is known on the Farm of
the present crop of Aggie fighters,
but the Davis school has turned cut
strong teams in recent years, and
should offer a tough line-up tonight.
The Aggie matches will be the sec
ond intercollegiate clash for the In
dians, who outboxed the Nevada
Wolf Pack for a 4 to 3 victory in
the Pavilion a week ago.
Four Again Billed
Veterans of the Nevada bouts who
will climb through the plush ropes
wearing the Stanford colors again
tonight are Fred Glover, feather;
Vance Rogers, lightweight; Fred
Johnson, captain and middleweight;
and Paul "Red" Targhetta, heavy.
Glover, Rogers, and Johnson are
better than average college boxers
in their respective divisions, and
may be expected to fall little, if
any, short of repeating their winning
performances of a week ago. Tar
ghetta is a tough opponent for any
collegiate heavy, but his shorter
height and reach have proved a
handicap so far that he has not
quite overcome.
Other fighters in the Indian line
up tonight will be Mark Kai-Kee,
bantamweight; Jim Kelley, welter;
and Hugh Keenan, light-heavy.
They replace Yuji Imai, Dick Miller,
and Gordon Gilbert of the crew
which met Nevada.
The new men are all clever and
fast in getting about on the canvas
and seem capable of handling their
Aggie assignments. Keenan looked
better in a practice round Wednes
day against Ed Dillon, former Stan
ford heavyweight, than at any time
during the season.
