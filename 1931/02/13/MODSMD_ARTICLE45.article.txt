I The Warner system vs. the modi- '
j lied Warner system.
That will probably be the situa
j tion in the Big Game next year,
when "Navy Bill" Ingram leads the
Golden Bears in his first invasion
of the Stanford stadium in an at
| tempt to end the long string of
Cardinal football victories.
Just how modified Ingram's sys-
I tern will be from Pop's own re
mains an unanswered question. It
i was at first thought that he would
employ a shift, but his choice of as
j sistants includes not one graduate
j of either the Rockne or the Jones
] schools.
Allison, Wickhorst Chosen
Leonard B. "Stub" Allison, as-
I sistant grid coach at Wisconsin, and
Frank Wickhorst, line coach at
lowa, will assist Ingram at Califor
i nia, it has been announced at the
; Berkeley institution.
j The choice of Wickhorst is not al
together surprising, he having been

| captain of the greatest eleven In
gram ever turned out, the 192tJ An
napolis team. Wickhorst was named
line coach of lowa in 1927, a posi
tion he has held ever since.
Allison is not a stranger to the
coast, having been assistant grid
coach at the University of Washing
ton in 1919 and 1920. He was gradu -
ated from Carleton College in 1917,
where he captained the football
team the year before. During the
I war he saw 16 months' service in
France, rising to the rank of cap-
I tain.
Arrives February 21
"Navy Bill" and entourage will
1 arrive in Berkeley February 24, a
j week earlier than he first an
| nounced. He is evidently quite
j anxious to commence drilling his
j system into the Bears in spring
I practice.
And then maybe we shall sec
! whether he plans to use his regular
; modified Warner system, or a modi
| fied modified Warner system.
