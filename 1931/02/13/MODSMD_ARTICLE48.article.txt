# BABES READY FOR PRELIMINARY TILT WITH CUB QUINTET
## Cardinal Frosh Determined To Even Series; Each Team Loses Star 
### 
Determined to even the series and
avenge themselves for the 39-22 de
feat of three weks ago, a fighting
freshman quintet will clash with the
University of California Cubs for
ihe second time of the season to
morrow night.
The game, which will be a pre
liminary to the varsity contest,
promises to be a nip-and-tuck battle
from the opening tip-off at. C:3t)
i o'clock until the final gun. The
. Cardinal babes have shown such
great improvement since the Oak
, land fray that they must be con
ceded at least an equal chance lo
! win.
Coach John Bunn remarked after
the first California game that the
Indian frosh were just beginning to
\ demonstrate that they knew some
basketball. Since that time they
have improved to the extent that
Bunn believes they are capable of
tieing the series tomorrow night.
Two Stars Injured
The Eastbay game produced two
stars, two stars who will not be in
j the game tomorrow. Smith, who was
the best Redshirt on the floor that
night, is recovering from a broken
arm. An X-ray photograph the day
after the contest revealed that he
had played throughout the game
i with the fracture. What he might
have done had he not been troubled
with the injury is a matter of con-
Ijeeture.
Eifert, the Cub captain, who was
| the biggest factor in the California
victory, will also be on the sidelines
J tonight, having -received a broken
i wrist in the recent S.F.U. game.
Wright has been filling in well for
| Smith, however, and Essner seems
jto be filling the shoes of Eifert
1 nicely. Both looked good in practice
! games last Tuesday night, when the
j Indian frosh downed Santa Clara,
131 to 25, and the Cubs nosed out
| Lowell High School of San Fran
(cisco, 23 to 21.
| In July out of 12,803 applicants
| for entrance into the navy only 1(530
j were accepted.
