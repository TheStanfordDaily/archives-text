ested group of more than thirty at

room of the Stanford Union. Miss

Ichihashi of the Stanford History

The Baha'i movement is a social
as well as a religious one. It offers
practical plans for universal peace,
such as universal education, ex
change of students between one
country and another, an interna
tional tribunal, and an auxiliary in
ternational language. For this, Miss
Root favors Esperanto, which she
claims is both simple to learn and
beautiful.
Founded in Persia
The foundation of the Baha'i cause
was laid, according to Miss Root, by
Baha'u'llah in Persia toward the
middle of the last century. He was
greatly persecuted and was impris
oned until, with the coming into
power of the Young Turks, he was
set free. He died soon after and his
eldest son, 'Abu'l-Baha was appoint
ed to take his father's place as lead
er of the movement. Shoghi Effendi,
grandson of 'Abu'l-Baha and the
present leader of Baha'i, spoke be
fore the Stanford students in 1912
at the invitation of Dr. David Starr
Jordan.
Other important Baha'i teachings
are that prejudices of all kinds must
be forgotten, that religion must be
the cause of unity, and that religion
must be in accord with science and
reason. It is interesting to note that
the World Congress for Interna
tional Peace through Religion, which
is to meet in November, 1932, in
Washington, has a Baha'i as chair
man of the program committee.
It is possible to be a Christian or
a Buddhist and a Baha'i at the same
