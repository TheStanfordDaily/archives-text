# STANFORD BOASTS OF BEST COLLEGE DIAMOND IN U.S.
## Even Babe Ruth Not Good Enough To Hit Ball Over Fence 
### 
Any player who Hits a baseball
! over the centerfield fence on the new
I Stanford diamond will have to be
] better than Babe Ruth. The new
field, to be dedicated Saturday in
' the Santa Clara game, is 495 feet
| from the home plate to the center
| field fence, while Ruth's longest of
i ficial homer was only 420 feet, and
I his best with a fungo bat, 460 feet.
"The only home runs that will be
! made on the new field will be when
| the ball lands in deep center," says
i Coach Harry Wolter.
Three triples have been made so
I far in practice games, the only player
; who tried to stretch his hit into a
| homer having been put out by the
I catcher.
Field Is Sunken
The field, in the opinion of ex
perts, the best collegiate diamond in
the country, is sunk 10 feet below
the surface of the ground. Special
methods of staking down the bases
will prevent leg injuries to runners,
i such as happened to Captain Bill
! Laird last season.
The stands will seat 4,500 and have
| ample room for the press and spa
j cious dug-outs for the players. Three
! gates and stairways provide the en
i trances.
The field, erected by the Board of
I Athletic Control, will also be used
j for various types of intramural
I games, as well as rallies and outdoor
concerts.
