# DUCK RULES IN ROOST Frosh Chased By Monster APES ENCINA SPONSOR
## 
### 
Sequoia may have its horses, cows,
automobiles, et al. to lend a unique
touch to the interior decorations, but
Encina lays claim to a duck and is
proud of it.
Wednesday night John Lauritzen,
head sponsor, was startled to find a
duck under his bed. Said duck was
forcibly ejected from his room to
continue its unassuming career in
the cold, bleak halls of Encina.
Kindly freshmen, attracted by the
duck's pensive glances, sought to
bring it happiness by housing it in
the room of Chuck White, of frosh
football fame.
White's roommates were awakened
early in the morning by the shrieks
of the former, who was scrambling
about the room as in an endeavor
to evade the clutches of a monster.
Quick rescue measures saved White
from an unknown fate at the hands
of the duck, and after calm was re
stored, White disgustedly flung
Monsie'r Duck out of the room.
Later adventures of the duck were
legion. He paid his compliments to
several frosh and led a merry life
until early the next morning, he was
captured by one of the barbers from
the Encina barbershop. The now
famous duck at present resides in a
Palo Alto backyard, where he de
votes his time to catching slugs.
