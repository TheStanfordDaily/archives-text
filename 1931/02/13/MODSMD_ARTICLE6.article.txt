# BROWN REFUTES FRAUD CHARGE
## Postmaster Declares Blaine Attempts Deception 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12. (/P)
Chairman Blaine of the Senate pos
tal lease investigating committee,
was charged tonight by Postmaster
General Brown, with using "the
cloak of his Senatorial immunity"
in a "deliberate" attempt to deceive
the American public into believing
there has been widespread fraud in
post office leases.
"The Senator has not a scintilla of
evidence to support such a charge,"
Brown said, in a formal statement.
No Large Gifts
The Postmaster General denied
that beneficiaries of the postal leases
have contributed a million and a
quarter dollars to the Coolidge and
Hoover campaign funds, asserting
that although they number many
thousands they have contributed
"the insignificant sum of $500 to
Republican campaign funds since
1924.
Referring to this incident, he said:
"Senator Blaine now charges the
present administration of the post
office department with failure to co
operate with his committee.
Department Gave Aid
"The fact is that the department
has afforded Senator Blaine's agents
and investigators every facility for
doing their work.
"It has made available to them
the complete files concerning all
existing lease contracts. It will con
tinue to make such records avail
able.

"The department does not intend,
however, to make any disclosures
of information which is related only

to its future policies, and which, if
made pu√ülic prematurely, would
embarrass and handicap the trans- ;
action of public business." , ;
