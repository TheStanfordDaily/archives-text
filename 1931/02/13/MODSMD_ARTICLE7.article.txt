# TRACK MEN TO RUN HALF DISTANCES IN PRACTICE WORKOUT
## 
### 
Looking forward to the interclass
track meet and Irish marathon
scheduled for next Friday, Coach
"Dink" Templeton will probably lun
his varsity and freshman trackmen
over half distances at the weekly
squad meet this afternoon.
Injuries and a soft track have
been holding back progress at the
Oval during the past week. Arne
West, star broad jumper, is still out
with a pulled leg muscle. Ned Johns,
pole vaulter, has been running
around the field these days, but an
injured hand has been keeping him
out of vaulting practice.
Yesterday, Neikirk, half-miler,
aggravated an old ankle injury, put
ling him on (he shelf for at least
Â«'i week. DeGroot, another pole
vaulter, is still out of competition
with a bad ankle.
A1 Ray has been steadily improv
ing in the javelin, getting off one
toss during the week that sailed out
past the 180-foot mark. Bob Jones
has been consistently throwing the
discus out around the 150-foot
mark, while in the other weight
event George Grey, Here Laborde,
and Nellie Gray are putting the shot
46 feet regularly.
