# GERMAN FILMS WELL RECEIVED
## Large Audiences View Two English Club Pictures 
### 
Yesterday saw the curious spec
j tacle of two moving pictures, as
; good as they were advertised. "Sig
! fried" and "Kriemhild's Revenge,"
i presented in the afternoon and eve
| ning, respectively, by the English
! Club, both fulfilled all the flattering
i predictions concerning them. Over
i 400 people saw the first, and over
250 the latter.
I The backgrounds and spectacular
effects could not be bettered in Hol
lywood, and the perfect detail and
unusual photography were sure in
l dications of the German origin of
I these film masterpieces.
Based on the Nordland saga im
' mortalized in Wagner's opera, the
: films were a perfect blending of the
1 dream-like unreality of a myth, and
! the strong action of an adventure
story. The actors, who lived up to
their reputations, as among the best
j in Europe, were particularly inter
esting from the standpoint of cos
tuming. The details and background
of medieval life and the clever facial
! distortions of various characters
) were perhaps more impressive to
' American eyes lhan Hollywood-like
long shots of court scenes.
The German flare for working out
I every minute point to perfection was
! everywhere evident, and the photog-
I raphy, revolutionary in past, will
! give other producers something to
! think about for some time.
