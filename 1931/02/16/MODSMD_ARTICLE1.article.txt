# CONGRESS MAY EXCLUDE ALIEN 'UNDESIRABLES'
## Measure Now In Committee And Approval Of Hoover Is Expected Soon CURBS DOPE TRAFFIC Passage Will Also Limit Quota Of Immigrants 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (/P). â€”
Undesirable aliens will be deported
from the United States and few
immigrants will be admitted for two
years if pending legislation is enact
ed at this session.
The administration drive to rid
the country of undesirable aliens
advanced a step today. President
Hoover received a bill to deport
aliens convicted of smuggling nar
cotics. His approval is expected.
Favorable action on the chief ex
ecutive's request for $500,000 to em
ploy 245 patrolmen to accelerate de
portation of undesirables has been
indicated by the House Appropri
ations Committee.
The Johnson-Hayden bill, in line
with Hoover's recommendation, is
to be considered by the House Im
migration Committee tomorrow. It
would authorize the Secretary of
Labor to institute deportation pro
ceedings, particularly against aliens
convicted of charges involving a
penalty of one year imprisonment or
more.
Proceedings also could be insti
tuted in districts where the aliens
made unlawful entry instead of
through the Labor Department.
The burdfen of proof of legal en
try would be placed on the alien
and any person having knowledge
of illegal entry also could be prose
cuted. The last provision is aimed
at smugglers.
A vote is scheduled for tomorrow
by the House Immigration Commit
tee on the Jenkins bill to restrict
immigration for two years as an
employment aid.
