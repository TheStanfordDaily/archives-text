# VETERAN BONUS BEFORE SENATE
## Couzens Seeks To Hold Up Loan Bill Action 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15. (/P) —
With a majority of the House Re
publicans supporting the Democrats
in their desire for a fifty per cent
veterans' loan proposal, Senator
Couzens of Michigan announced his
intention to hold up further legisla
tion of any sort in the Senate until
disposition of the veterans' bonus is
made.
Opposition to Speaker Longworth's
plan for House action tomorrow on
veterans' legislation was voiced by
Republican Leader Tilson announc
ing his intention to vote against the
measure. The open break in the
House Republican leadership came
as sponsors of the measure forecast
quick action by Congress in an ef
fort to lay the legislation before
President Hoover early to avoid a
possible pocket veto. <,
Tilson Hits Measure
This has been predicted in ad
ministration circles and Tilson's
statement added strength to the
opinion. He is a strong administra
tion follower.
'The apparent determination to
pass under suspension of the rules
of the House," Tilson said, "the so
called bonus certificate bills, is in
my judgment, most regrettable."
Too Little Time
He chargcd that there had been
insufficient time in which to study
the proposal and said he could not
support a measure "recklessly
rushed to a vote over the protest
of the Treasury." Secretary Mellon
has indicated that such a measure
will disrupt all the well-laid plans
of the Treasury in the immediate
future.
Tilson said that there should be
no difficulty in preparing a bill
which would permit additional loans
to veterans who are in actual need
in such a way that it would not put
a strain on the Treasury.
