# Death Chinese Penalty For Unguarded Speech
## 
### VIRGINIA ELSTON 
"Death is a common penalty pro
fessors pay for unguarded speech in
Chinese schools, for China must
still use militaristic measures in her
education," stated Henry Lin, trans
fer from Wuchang University to
Stanford, in a discussion of Chinese
schools Thursday. Lin was the honor
guest at the regular fellowship tea
sponsored by local members of the
National Students' Federation of
America.
Although China is in a revolu
tionary state, there is no military
training in her colleges, Lin said.
The students themselves take no
active part on either side of the
conflicting" forces. "Their work is
the study of the political situation
and the spreading of propaganda,"
said Lin.
University education in ihe Orient
is much like the American system,
according to Lin, for China in her
changing has copied our' ways.
However, fivo years is the average
time required to complete the uni
versity course. There is no honor

I system in the Chinese schools, and
i Lin doubts whether it will ever be
| introduced. "Human nature is too
j anxious to take advantages," he re-
I marked.
"Fraternities and social clubs
, don't exist in Chinese universities,"
j Lin said. "The social life widely
I differs from that of American col
! leges. Dancing is held in ill-repute.
J Gatherings usually consist of lec
tures, musicales, and the like."
Drinking is not so wide-spread
j in China as in America. "The Chi
nese enjoy light wines with their
j meals. Brandy, gin, and whisky are
generally imported from America,"
Ihe added.
Soccer is the favorite sport in
Chinese schools. In the Orient it is
i called football. Baseball is also
! played, but not as much as soccer.
Intercollegiate meets arc held and
thousands attend them,
i "Education in China is more im
i port ant than it has ever been," de
i olared Lin, "because it is in the
j hands of the college graduates that
I the future of the country rests."
