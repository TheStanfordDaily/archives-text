# BACK TO FARM MOVE SEEN IN SOVIET RUSSIA
## Government Embarrassed By Immigration To Collectives 
### 
MOSCOW, Feb. 15.
Russia is going "back to the farm,"
according to figures just issued by
the government.
During the last ten days in Janu
ary and the first ten in February a
total of 726,000 families joined the
collective farms, the figures show.
This migration is the greatest in
history. Development of these farms
always has been the backbone of
the soviet government.
Rich Peasants Barred
The word "joined" is used by the
government as meaning these fami
lies have made application to enter
the collective farms. The majority
will be accepted, although the ku
laks, or rich peasants, are not per
mitted to take part in the move
ment.
The widespread acceptance of the
invitation to settle on the farms is
causing the government some em
barrassment, as the agriculture
commisariat has agreed to provide
all the collectives with tractors and
other machinery. Last year much
machinery was bought in the United
States while machine plants were
constructed here. These are not
operating full capacity, and there is
not sufficient machinery on hand.
No Machinery
As a result, numerous workers on
the collective farms this year will
not have modern machinery, and
will have to struggle along with old
methods.
It is estimated the collective farms
will cultivate 66.000,000 hectars of
land in 1931. The capital invested
by the state on the collective farms
this year is placed at 3,800,000,000
rubles (about $1,900,000,000).
