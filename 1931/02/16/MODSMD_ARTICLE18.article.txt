Scales may be disregarded in a
1 musical education, according to
Harold Bauer, famous pianist who
i will play here Thursday evening
under the auspices of the A.S.S.U.
! Concert Series.
"Students sometimes toil for years
• to play a perfectly even scale," says
Bauer, "and then they never use it.
Perfectly even tones are monoton
ous; the primary object of music is
! expression. On the violin or any of
the stringed instruments one note
j can be played in a variety of ways,
\ but on the piano variety is achieved
by the relation to each other of a
series of notes.
"The music student should first
find out what his music expresses
and then use every means to make
! it possible to express it in just the
way he understands and feels it. It
takes a great deal of imagination to
think of a scale as expressing any
thing. Therefore I say begin with
pieces, for in the course of playing
a piece the pianist can find out
where his technique is deficient and
remedy it."
