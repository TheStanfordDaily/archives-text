# ROBERT DURYEA, '13, ONCE CREW CAPTAIN, MAY BECOME ARTIST
## 
### 
Robert Duryea, who rowed on
the Stanford crew in '11, '12, and
'13 and captained it in '13, the year
he graduated, has pursued the vo
cation of civil engineer ever since
ad now bids fair to become an
artist.
Duryea, finding that time passed
slowly during his daily commute
between Palo Alto and San Fran
cisco, found that he could make it
pass more quickly by whittling
small objects out of bits of wood.
Yesterday he made his debut as
a sculptor when bits of wood and
bronze castings which he had de
signed went on display at the Public
Library gallery as part of a Palo
Alto Art Club exhibition.
The figures which he carves out
on the train and finishes at home
with a dentist's foot drill represent
griffons, lizards, snails, and all man
ner of beasts, real and imaginary.
Being an engineer, Duryea be
lieves that beauty should be com
bined with utility. Therefore his
bits of art work are designed as
paper weights, foot-scrapers, radi
ator caps, faucet handles, and other
useful articles.
