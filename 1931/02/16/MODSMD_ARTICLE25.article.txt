# SERIES WIN IS FINAL HOPE OF CARD HOOP IN
## Title Chances Blasted By Saturday Night's Loss To Bear Quintet KINTANA DECIDES TILT Moffatt Takes High-Point Honors With 12 
### Stewart Crawford 
As a result of the 37-34 decision
that the Indian basketball five
dropped in the Pavilion Saturday
night to an inspired Golden Bear,
but one objective, remains in the
1931 Cardinal court season, a series
win from California. The slender
hope for a tie in the conference
race has been blasted, but the argu
ment with the Berkeley cagers re
mains at one game each. It will be
settled in the Oakland Auditorium
next Saturday.
By winning from the Cardinals,
the California quintet kept abreast
with U.S.C., whose basketball team
eliminated the Bruins from the
scramble on the same evening.
Situation Changed
So when Bunn's men meet the
Berkeley five in the deciding game,
the stage will be set differently than
it was here in the Pavilion. The
Bear, sniffing of conference title
meat, will have every reason to
win, while defeat might mean elimi
nation. The Indian, with no cham
pionship hopes clouding its mind,
will be concentrating on one thing,
its first Bear series scalp in many a
year.
With Farm sport gossip today still
centering around that nip and tuck
battle of Saturday night, fans look
ing for the reason why Stanford
lost seem to agree on Joe Kintana.
After California had led throughout
the first half, which ended 17 to 13,
and the Cardinal basketeers had
come back at the opening of the sec
ond period to tie the score at 21 to
21 and keep pace with the U.C. five
until but two minutes remained, that
gentleman broke loose to chalk up
two field goals and a free throw to
cinch the contest.
MofTatt's Shooting Feature
To the uncanny shooting of Phil
MofTatt goes the credit for keeping
the Indians in the contest at all. It
was he who countered with field
goals each time Davis, Coffield, or
Kintana recorded one earlier in the
tilt. Time and again, "Phancy" Phil
shot long ones from right under the
nose of a guarding Berkeleyite.
Reggie Mead's work, also, should
leave no doubt in the eyes of the
fans that he is worthy of the first
string forward berth. Though he
took but few tries at the basket, he
made every opportunity count, gath
ering seven points, and exhibiting
some of the best passing that a local
hoop axi,ist has shown in some time.
High scoring honors for the eve
ning went to MofTatt with 12 points.
Davis led the Bears with 11, while
Kintana had a total of nine.
