# THE 						MEN WITH THE WHISTLES
## 
### 
-By Jiltendance figures and Hie brand of basketball dis
played this year, (he Pacific Coast Conference has defi
nitely established itself as a major league hoop circuit. All
lour teams in the southern division of the conference put
last, well-coached quintets on the court this season, with
sensational contests before packed pavilions being the
natural outcome.
It is therefore unfair to the spectators to have basket
ball of high caliber marred by the sub-standard officiating
that has characterized nearly every one of the 1!).'{1 confer
ence games. The muttered rumblings and outspoken pro
tests concerning that officiating must have been fully justi
fied by the wretched exhibition staged by the referees at
the Big (lame last Saturday.
No alibis are intended, inasmuch as The Daily believes
that competent officiating would not have affected the final
outcome of the contest. For the many, many fouls that
were committed by members of both teams and not called,
there is some semblance of an excuse. The referees, not
being Argus-eyed, cannot see everything. Hut when the
player dribbling down the court, whom the officials might
be expected to watch, breaks a dribble and takes extra
steps without being called, there is room for protest. Time
and again on Saturday night these infractions were per
mitted without a whistle being blown.
Both Caddv Works, l .C.L.A. coach, and Sam Barry,
I'.S.C. basketball chief, were much dissatisfied with the
work of local officials in the games that their teams played
in this section. Barry, it will be recalled, spent a great deal
of (he Stanford-Trojan games here leaping to his feet and
grimacing disgustedly at the referees' decisions, as did
Nibs Price of California on Saturday night.
The officiating in the Southland has been equally as
unsatisfactory, reports would indicate. Price, after the two
Bear - Trojan games in Los Angeles, formaJlv protested
against the work of the referees there. Coach John Bunn
of Stanford has declined to comment officially about the
arbiters.
Where there is so much smoke, there must be some fire,
even when allowances are made for the disgruntled feel
ings of defeated teams. The Pacific Coast Conference is
big enough to deserve competent officiating, something that
has been lacking during the current season.
