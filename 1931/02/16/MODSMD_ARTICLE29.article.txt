# RATING THE FACULTY MEMBERS

Submitting faculty members to a grading system simi
lar to that under which students operate has already been
tried in three eastern universities, and this spring will be
attempted at Ohio State I'niversily. Seniors at Ohio State
will grade their professors during the spring quarter, and
the results will aid the university administration in judging
the individual and instruction value of the faculty mem
bers,
To the Daihf Califomian, "With the evils of the present
student grading system very evident and much talked of,"
it seems "rather improbable that students, even seniors,
will be able entirely to put away their prejudices and per
sonal feelings to grade the faeullv fairlv."
That is a pretty fair objection. The question resolves
itself into one of just what standards of grading are to be
applied to the faculty or is il just another popularity con
test? In addition to the bias of personal feeling, the pro
posed plan appears to have other important disadvantages.
Most students are unable to measure accurately the com
petence of an instructor, without in some degree confusing
il with their own success in the instructor's subject. And
there are many factors of competence which might he dis
torted in student judgment out of their true importance,
which itself might be unknown. How would wc rate a
fluent lecturer against a man of distinct ability in his field
but whose lectures are cold and uninspiring? On what
((million basis could we grade a laboratory instructor and
section leader in citizenship?
Without seeming too technical, may we ask whether
the grades would be plus-minus or not and would the
Honor (lode apply? Professors, alternate seals, please!
