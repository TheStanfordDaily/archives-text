## EXPEL ALL CHEATERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
1 have just read Dr. Bailey's arti
cle on the present honor system. It
brings to my mind several points
which I should like to mention in
your column.
First of all, is what we have in
any way an honor system? Students
are put on their hono;-, but if they
are caught it is the duty 'of other
students to report them. Is that
honor? It seems to me that we
should do one of three things:
1. Go back to the old idea of an
instructor being always present to
see that there is no cheating.
2. Put the students absolutely on
their honor and then forget about
watching them.
3. Make it—and name it—a sort
of student supervision, in which
each student is responsible for what
he and his neighbors do.
Another point that seems to be
prevalent here is the idea that there
isn't much difference between copy
ing a neighbor's examination paper
and cramming with him before the
ex. After all, it is the knowledge we
are after, so does it matter if a
student finds it easier to work with
another? If the examination can be
passed, the student must know his
subject at least fairly well. But after
the questions have been handed
out, it is decidedly cheating to get
any new information on the subject
from any outside source.
And then there is the fact that
there is too much talk about the
failures of our system. A new stu
dent, hearing constantly that "every
one cheats" is pretty apt to think
that it isn't so bad after all, since it
is so common. We must, as I said,
decide on a course of action and
then stop talking about its failures.
Last of all, no matter what our
system is, WE MUST OBEY ITS
RULES. Instead of pardoning this
student and that, we must, without
exception, expel all cheaters who
are caught for at least a year, dur
ing which time they must work for
a set period—that is, if we expcct
any system to work. This business
of suspending them for about two
months, or giving them special
privileges (I happen to know of
two such cases) is one of the best
reasons why there is so much of it
going on. For flunking out, we must
work for seven months and miss
three quarters, and now even that

f privilege has been taken away. Rut
for cheating we §re given th.ee
chances and then told to leave for
the rest of the quarier. Is this at all
fair? I'm afraid I can't see it.
As a final word, we must figure
i out some course of action, and, once
decided, WE MUST EXPECT
I EVERYONE TO FOLLOW OUR
OWN SET REGULATIONS.

subject at least fairly well. But after
the questions have been handed
out, it is decidedly cheating to get
any new information on the subject
from any outside source.
And then there is the fact that
there is too much talk about the
failures of our system. A new stu
dent, hearing constantly that "every
one cheats" is pretty apt to think
that it isn't so bad after all, since it
is so common. We must, as I said,
decide on a course of action and
then stop talking about its failures.
Last of all, no matter what our
system is, WE MUST OBEY ITS
RULES. Instead of pardoning this
student and that, we must, without
exception, expel all cheaters who
are caught for at least a year, dur
ing which time they must work for
a set period—that is, if we expcct
any system to work. This business
of suspending them for about two
months, or giving them special
privileges (I happen to know of
two such cases) is one of the best
reasons why there is so much of it
going on. For flunking out, we must
work for seven months and miss
three quarters, and now even that

f privilege has been taken away. Rut
for cheating we §re given th.ee
chances and then told to leave for
the rest of the quarier. Is this at all
fair? I'm afraid I can't see it.
As a final word, we must figure
i out some course of action, and, once
decided, WE MUST EXPECT
I EVERYONE TO FOLLOW OUR
OWN SET REGULATIONS.

The Editor, Sir:
1 have just read Dr. Bailey's arti
cle on the present honor system. It
brings to my mind several points
which I should like to mention in
your column.
First of all, is what we have in
any way an honor system? Students
are put on their hono;-, but if they
are caught it is the duty 'of other
students to report them. Is that
honor? It seems to me that we
should do one of three things:
1. Go back to the old idea of an
instructor being always present to
see that there is no cheating.
2. Put the students absolutely on
their honor and then forget about
watching them.
3. Make it—and name it—a sort
of student supervision, in which
each student is responsible for what
he and his neighbors do.
Another point that seems to be
prevalent here is the idea that there
isn't much difference between copy
ing a neighbor's examination paper
and cramming with him before the
ex. After all, it is the knowledge we
are after, so does it matter if a
student finds it easier to work with
another? If the examination can be
passed, the student must know his
subject at least fairly well. But after
the questions have been handed
out, it is decidedly cheating to get
any new information on the subject
from any outside source.
And then there is the fact that
there is too much talk about the
