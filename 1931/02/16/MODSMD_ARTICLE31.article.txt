| The Editor, Sir:
We, the undersigned, wish to ox
; press our hearty appreciation of a
i refreshingly tolerant editorial which
graced your publication on Friday,
; February 13, 1931. We rejoice in the
| fact that campus journalism, at last
lat Stanford, is at last to afford
| something more than cheap and
neurotic pacifism. We have been
sincerelv ashamed of the militarist
| baiting which has substituted for
j editoria 'lacumen heretofore. Per
j sonal insults, petty sarcasm, and
\ self-righteous contempt have been
| the measure of most effusions in
i aimed at all wearers
j of riding boots.
Unfortunately, it is indeed un
! likely that slumbering mentalities
; will be effectually disturbed even
j by the rattle of musketry. It has
| been our lot to learn how, in piping
| times of so-called peace, certain
j people blithely, and with significant
i lack of modesty, call down biess-
I ings upon themselves and what thoy
j fatuously acclaim as #their anti
militarism. When these same self
j blessed mis-leaders of history have
; once again helped to muddle things
| into a state of war, they will be
\ found hysterically calling down
j curses upon untrained slackers and
j enemy alike.
Blessing ourselves and cursing the
; other fellow is pretty poor sport in
! peace or war. To wage war, more
i stamina is required than cursings
! and fickle unwillingness. Similarly,
I to secure peace, more is required
than vacuous willingness and bless-
I ings. Perhaps with a little modesty
j and patient reading our fire-eating
i anti-militarists could get over
blindly reacting like a bull to a red
i flag. They might thereafter find time
I to do something more nearly appro-
I priate and constructive.
Sincerely yours,
Hobart Young
