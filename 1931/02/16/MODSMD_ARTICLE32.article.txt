# Cabbages and Things

Our five little campus flaming
hearts, the cardinal team (jerseys
are still red, and not Indian color!),
stayed home Saturday evening and
presented us with a basketball game
that made the calmest and most un
enlightened spectator sit up and
pound his neighbor's fedoi'a.
Even though Cal won, wc can
feel still that we played tactful
gentlemen's parts; and it will
make next week's victory seem
much more worthwhile. We've
decided against a week-end trip
South in favor of a trip to Oak
land to see the last game of the
series. Line forms to the right,
for tickets. Start early, and have
picnic supper with the rest of
the audience.
We have real sympathy for Tyler,
the snappy little forward who won't
have another chance at the ball
game this season. He has joined the
ranks of the anti-pickle eaters, with
a swell case of the mumps. (Thanks
for that opportunity!)
Baseball enthusiasts from/
miles around had been anxious
ly awaiting the dedication of the
new Stanford sunken baseball

diamond, on Saturday. Santa
Clara's swarthy sons were all
ready for a smashing start of
the conference season, and sn
arc we. The weather man de
veloped another opinion on the
niaiUir, though—and Santa Clara
hasn't much of a water-polo
team to boast about. And so,
we wait.
Now we have a nev/s item of in
terest, proving that collitch em
ployees are all for the Bible and
what it says, but student have their
own ideas of the matter.
The Bible, you know, says, "Let
there be light. And there was light."
Mr. Stanford Community said, "Let
there be light." And there were
lights on street corners on the Row.
Some of them were placed by soror
ity house driveways, so that the
little girls wouldn't stumble in get
ting out of cars, late at night.
Now the Corporation Yards
objects to one of these houses
that they've put twelve globes
in one lamp, during the last two
months, and every one has been
knockcd down. It's really aw
fully dark, now, too. lint maybe
they don't mind stumbling?

that made the calmest and most un
enlightened spectator sit up and
pound his neighbor's fedoi'a.
Even though Cal won, wc can
feel still that we played tactful
gentlemen's parts; and it will
make next week's victory seem
much more worthwhile. We've
decided against a week-end trip
South in favor of a trip to Oak
land to see the last game of the
series. Line forms to the right,
for tickets. Start early, and have
picnic supper with the rest of
the audience.
We have real sympathy for Tyler,
the snappy little forward who won't
have another chance at the ball
game this season. He has joined the
ranks of the anti-pickle eaters, with
a swell case of the mumps. (Thanks
for that opportunity!)
Baseball enthusiasts from/
miles around had been anxious
ly awaiting the dedication of the
new Stanford sunken baseball

diamond, on Saturday. Santa
Clara's swarthy sons were all
ready for a smashing start of
the conference season, and sn
arc we. The weather man de
veloped another opinion on the
niaiUir, though—and Santa Clara

team to boast about. And so,
we wait.
Now we have a nev/s item of in
terest, proving that collitch em
ployees are all for the Bible and
what it says, but student have their
own ideas of the matter.
The Bible, you know, says, "Let
there be light. And there was light."
Mr. Stanford Community said, "Let
there be light." And there were
lights on street corners on the Row.
Some of them were placed by soror
ity house driveways, so that the
little girls wouldn't stumble in get
ting out of cars, late at night.
Now the Corporation Yards
objects to one of these houses
that they've put twelve globes
in one lamp, during the last two
months, and every one has been
knockcd down. It's really aw
fully dark, now, too. lint maybe
they don't mind stumbling?
