REDUCING-At the Varsity.
Some more Marie Dressier-Polly
Moran comedy, not quite so custard
pieish as in "Caught Short," but
more effective. The two make a
perfect pair, and there is nothing
i in all moviedom that quite equals
some of Miss Dressler's facial gym
i nasties.
Anita Page and Lucicn Littlefield
i do their best to make the heart ap
peal stuff convincing, but it is all
incidental to the Dressler-Moran
hilarities, the highlight of which
occurs when the latter gets tangled
iupin a reducing belt. —E. E. H.

SCANDAL SHEET —At the New
Stanford

The director of this picture wont
to a lot of trouble to got a fairly in
| teresting plot about the hard-boiled
managing editor of a tabloid news
paper, captured the city room at
! mosphere quite successfully, and
| (hen wrecked everything by tagging

| it with a typical Hollywood ending
that jerks the audience from tragedy
| to farce without warning.
George Bancroft is splendid as the
managing editor who printed every
thing, no matter whom it hurt, and
the streamlined Kay Francis is
1 equally good as his wife. Clive
Brook, one of the better actors, does
| a beautiful job as the "other man."
If it weren't for the asinine finish,
I "Scandal Sheet" might have been
I a fine picture. As it is, entertaining
[ is the word.
