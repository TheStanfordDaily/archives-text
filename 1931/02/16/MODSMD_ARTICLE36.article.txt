University of Oregon students
i who express their artistic or literary
i ability on library books are liable
to a fine of $50 or six months' im
prisonment.
Students who feel that their
underlinings, marginal notes,
and graphic portrayals are of
lasting value and interest to
posterity must be suffering from
some kind of a complex.
And the person who puts mus
taches on pictures of Catherine II
| and trousers on cuts of Venus de
' Milo should be given a "coloring
: book" used to divert four-year-olds.
The Interfraternity Council of the
University of Wisconsin is attempt-
I ing to devise a plan of co-operative
buying and better rushing for the
| Greek letter societies of that cam
! pus.
Their work would be more useful
if they could devise a plan of co
! operative rushing and better buy
ing.
Dance tariffs .at Butler Uni
versity vary with the weight of
one's partnerâ€”so many cents a
pound. All co-eds are weighed
before they enter the dance hall.
There is a vital argument for
straight lines as against pleasingly
plump curves that is unanswerable.
Men students at the Massachu
i setts Institute of Technology recent
ly petitioned the administration for
newer and better co-eds.
That almost sounds like an
appeal of the Stanford rough
execpt that he would cry for
MORE co-cds and trust in fate
that they would be better.
The University of Chicago has in
stituted a course in modern police
! methods. Ex-gangsters are to aid in
i the instruction.
The course would probably
include careening madly down
the boulevard to get a milk
shake, stopping co-cds and ask
ing them their age, address,
telephone number, and where
they are going in such a hurry,
and breaking into places to de
termine if beverages containing
an illegal percentage of alcohol
arc being sold.
The course will probably prove
very popular with the students.
