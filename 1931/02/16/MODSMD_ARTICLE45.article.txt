A HEART-BKEAKER
For the benefit of ihose un
fortunates who missed the
drama in the Pavilion Saturday
night when a scrapping hard of
Indian basketeers put every
thing they had in the way of
basketball talent and fight into
a fray that was hopeless
against an undeniably "hot
Golden Bear, let us say that it
was heart-breaking. Though
they lost, to the Cardinal hoop
sters we offer a big hand. That
they deserve it, anyone who
witnessed the struggle will tes
tify.
From the chart of the game comes
Ihe surprising revelation that Stan
ford tankeel 33 per cent of its at
tempted field goals, while California
v/as only 25 per cent effective. To
most of the spectators it seemed
that almost every Berkeley try, no
matter from what angle of the court,
found its way through the hoop by
some manner or other. Among other
freak antics on the part of that
hoodooed basketball was the occa
sion when it left the hands of Cof
field on a long, beautifully arched
shot, struck the juncture of the
hoop and the backboard, bounded
high in the air, and then dropped
straight down through the ring for
I wo points.

The whole story, however, is
disclosed in the fact that the
Bear cage artists took 20 more
tries than the Redshirts. Most
of them were shots from behind
the foul line, shots taken on the
run. The most perfect defense
cannot prevent an opponent
from shooting. It can prevent
its rival from getting set for
these attempts. We wonder how
often Davis, Coffield, and Kin
tana surprised themselves as
well as the paid customers when
some of those one-handed at
tempts from the corner ended
Tip by making that swishing
sound through the net.
A pace that will tire even the in-,
comparable Vance Fawcett is no
less than furious. Still "Dazzy tired
so Saturday night that Bunn had to
take him out at the height of the
nip-and-tuck second-half battle.
Fawcett watched from the bench as
the score mounted, basket for bas
ket, until Moffatt knotted it wit;iin
two minutes of the final gun at
30-30.
At this point, the coach leaned
over to his most valuable playei
to ask if he was rested enough
to go in there and check that
Berkeley steam roller. With
"sure, I'm all right," Fawcett
slipped off his sweatshirt and
re-entered (lie fray. Within the
next three plays it was evident
that "Dazzy" had given all he
had. Nearly out on his feet, he
left the battle while fans on
both sides of the Pavilion joined
in a big ovation.
And so the southern half of the
Coast Conference has evolved into
a race between the Trojans and
California, since Troy defeated the
Bruins Saturday night. We
that John Bunn, early in the season,
predicted that the Bears would win
the title. Yet he also predicted that
if his courtmen grabbed the first
U.C. tilt, they would win the series.
To do that they must triumph up
in the Oakland auditorium next
Saturday. In that event, it will be
up to the Uclan quintet to down
U.S.C. in order that Nibs Price's
men may still be in the running.
Recently the Call-Bulletin
flashed a headline on the sports
page which read "Muir timed in
ten fiat."* This Bear sprinter is
considered the only hope of the
Berkeley institution for break
ing into the scoring in dash
events of the Big Meet. They
sec Hcc Dyer as the man to
beat. Wonder if they have no
ticed that Les Hables ran the
century Friday in 0.8 despite the
muddy oval? And with Lom
bard!. Giberson, and Howell all
capable of shading even time, it
looks as though the Blue and
Gold hope will remain unreal
ized. â€”Crawford.
