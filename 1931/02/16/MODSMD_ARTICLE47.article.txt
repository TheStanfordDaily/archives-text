### Lowell Cox 
His broken left wrist encased in
heavy bandages and adhesive tape,
Captain Hal Eifert took his place at
forward with the University of
California Cubs in the Pavilion Sat
urday night in a hcroic attempt to
clinch the freshVnan series, but in
spite of his efforts, the Indian quin
tet won a wild game, 42 to 39.
In a contest which exceeded the
varsity fray for thrills, the Red
shirts piled up big leads at the start j
of both halves, only to see them j
dwindle as the Cubs twice rallied.
Score Tied at Half '
The first period ended in a 24 to
24 deadlock, after Stanford had run
up a 15 to 1 lead at the one quar
ter post, while a desperate closing
California drive fell just short of
nosing the Cubs under the wire in
the lead.
Eifert Brilliant
It was Eifert's efforts which near
lv snatched a well-earned victory
from the fresh, and kept the in
i vaders in the game. In spile of a
! recently fractured wrist which was
expected to keep him on the bench
I for the rest of the season, the flashy
Cub forward accounted for seven
' field goals and three free throws, a
I total of 17 points. Several times he
looped in seemingly impossible shots
with his one good arm.
Topping Plays Well
Only the heroic efforts of the in
' jured Eifert overshadowed the
! splendid play of Keith Topping and
; Dave Packard. The former played
! up to the standard he set for him
! self in the Santa Clara game, scoring
| 17 points for high point honors, and
| being a demon on both offense and
defense.
Packard, who has seemed a little
off his game of late, again per
formed up to standard, trailing on
the heels of Topping with 16 tallies.
California in Lead
Only once were the California
; yearlings in the lead, near the end
jof the first period. After Topping
: and Packard had run wild at the
j start of the fracas, the Cub defense
I suddenly tightened, and with Eifert
j dropping in baskets from all parts
i of the court, Stanford was forced to
I call time out with the score 17 to 20
i against them.
Babes Tie Score
After a rest the babes came back
| to tie the score by half time, 24 to
i 24. The second half saw them again
; spurt ahead, with Topping leading
j the attack, but again they slumped
I half way through the period,
j Sloppy passing and a defense that
I strangely collapsed at this point very
nearly cost Coach John Bunn's pro
teges the game, but they tightened
| up in time to stave off the desperate
l Cub rally.

with his one good arm.
Topping Plays Well
Only the heroic efforts of the in
' jured Eifert overshadowed the
! splendid play of Keith Topping and

defense.
Packard, who has seemed a little
off his game of late, again per

the heels of Topping with 16 tallies.
California in Lead
Only once were the California

jof the first period. After Topping

j start of the fracas, the Cub defense
I suddenly tightened, and with Eifert
j dropping in baskets from all parts
i of the court, Stanford was forced to
I call time out with the score 17 to 20
i against them.
Babes Tie Score
After a rest the babes came back
| to tie the score by half time, 24 to
i 24. The second half saw them again
; spurt ahead, with Topping leading
j the attack, but again they slumped
I half way through the period,
j Sloppy passing and a defense that
I strangely collapsed at this point very
nearly cost Coach John Bunn's pro
teges the game, but they tightened
| up in time to stave off the desperate
l Cub rally.
