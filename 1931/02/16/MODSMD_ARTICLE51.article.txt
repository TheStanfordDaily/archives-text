# FOUR INTRAMURAL HOOP LEAGUE LEADS CLINCHED BY LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION
## 
### 
At the close of last week's compe
tition for the 1931 intramural bas
ketball championship, four league
leaderships were virtually clinched
and three remained to be decided
by fifth-round games.
Sigma Chi of League I, the Vaga
bonds of 111, Sequoia I of IV, and
the Business School of VI, are the
teams which have riveted their hold
upon first place in their divisions.
Sigma Chi Strong
The first mentioned, 1930 cham
pion, holds decisive victories over
the second-and third-place teams in
League I and hae only one more
game to play, that against the tail
end A.T.O.'s. They have shown
themselves to be one of the two
strongest contenders for this year's
title.
In League 11, Delta Kappa Epsilon
and Phi Kappa Sigma are staging a
keen contest for divisional honors.
Both are undefeated; both have won
four games. The Phi Kaps have
been running up higher scores; the
Dekes have been winning by bigger
margins. They beat the D.U.'s, 17-10,
a team which forced the Phi Kaps to
an overtime period to win, 21-19,
for example. Matched against each
other in the fifth round, they will
settle their differences and the
league championship.
Vagabonds Ilead League
Heading League 111 are the Vaga
bonds with no serious rival. Sigma
Nu, the second-place team, has
gained credit for all its victories
through the forfeit route. If they
should upset the Vagabonds in their
fifth-round clash, however, they will
fall heir to divisional honors.
Although El Campo is matching
the pace of Sequoia I in League IV
with three straight victories, they
have yet to meet the all-star hall
men and are conceded little chance
of winning.
Phi Kappa Fsi and El Toro
have distanced the opposition in
League V, the title of which they
will settle in their fifth-round con
test.
Business School in First
By their 22-14 victory over Delta

Tau Delta, the business School,
made certain their first-place posi
tion in VI. Ever, if they lose their
last game, they will get no worse
than a tie.
Three teams, Breakers, El Tigre,
and El Capitan, are making the
race in League VII a wide-open
affair. Two of them are due to be
knocked out of the running in com
ing clashes
Games scheduled for tonight are:
Kappa Alpha vs. Sigma Nu in
the Pavilion at 7 o'clock.
Beta Theta Pi vs. Alpha Delta Phi
in the gym at 7.
Sequoia I vs. Kappa Sigma in the
Pavilion at 8.
Encina V vs. Theta Chi in the

been running up higher scores; the
Dekes have been winning by bigger
margins. They beat the D.U.'s, 17-10,
a team which forced the Phi Kaps to
an overtime period to win, 21-19,
for example. Matched against each
other in the fifth round, they will
settle their differences and the
league championship.
Vagabonds Ilead League
Heading League 111 are the Vaga
bonds with no serious rival. Sigma
Nu, the second-place team, has
gained credit for all its victories
through the forfeit route. If they
should upset the Vagabonds in their
fifth-round clash, however, they will
fall heir to divisional honors.
Although El Campo is matching
the pace of Sequoia I in League IV
with three straight victories, they
have yet to meet the all-star hall
men and are conceded little chance
of winning.
Phi Kappa Fsi and El Toro
have distanced the opposition in
League V, the title of which they
will settle in their fifth-round con
test.
Business School in First
By their 22-14 victory over Delta

Tau Delta, the business School,
made certain their first-place posi
tion in VI. Ever, if they lose their
last game, they will get no worse
than a tie.
Three teams, Breakers, El Tigre,
and El Capitan, are making the
race in League VII a wide-open
affair. Two of them are due to be
knocked out of the running in com
ing clashes
Games scheduled for tonight are:
Kappa Alpha vs. Sigma Nu in
the Pavilion at 7 o'clock.
Beta Theta Pi vs. Alpha Delta Phi
in the gym at 7.
Sequoia I vs. Kappa Sigma in the
Pavilion at 8.
Encina V vs. Theta Chi in the
gym at 8.
At the close of last week's compe
tition for the 1931 intramural bas
ketball championship, four league
leaderships were virtually clinched
and three remained to be decided
by fifth-round games.
Sigma Chi of League I, the Vaga
bonds of 111, Sequoia I of IV, and
the Business School of VI, are the
teams which have riveted their hold
upon first place in their divisions.
Sigma Chi Strong
The first mentioned, 1930 cham
pion, holds decisive victories over
the second-and third-place teams in
League I and hae only one more
game to play, that against the tail
end A.T.O.'s. They have shown
themselves to be one of the two
strongest contenders for this year's
title.
In League 11, Delta Kappa Epsilon
and Phi Kappa Sigma are staging a
keen contest for divisional honors.
Both are undefeated; both have won
four games. The Phi Kaps have
been running up higher scores; the
Dekes have been winning by bigger
margins. They beat the D.U.'s, 17-10,
a team which forced the Phi Kaps to
an overtime period to win, 21-19,
