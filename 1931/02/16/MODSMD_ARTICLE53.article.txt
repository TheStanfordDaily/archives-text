# CARD FIGHTERS GAIN VICTORY IN DAVIS MEET
## Capt. Johnson, Glover Win Extra Round Matches; Targhetta Victor 
### 
Completing a five out of seven
bout victory for Coach Harry Ma
loney's boxers against the Califor
nia Aggies at Davis Friday night,
Paul "Red" Targhetta, Stanford
heavyweight, succeeded in landing
his dynamic body punch for the first
time this year, scoring a knock-out
for the varsity. This was Stanford's
second intercollegiate victory of the
season.
Targhetta drew an opponent in the
last match of the evening in Cort
Durara who overshadowed him in
height, weight, and reach. The
stocky red-headed Indian battler
got inside Durara's defense early in
the first round with a right hook to
the jaw followed by the right to
the body which won him the bout.
Captain Fred Johnson of Stan
ford had his hands full in defeating
the Davis middleweight, Gene
Crump. Both excellent boxers, the
men mixed it up so evenly through
out the scheduled three rounds, that
the judges called for an extra pe
riod. In the fourth, Johnson's vi
cious right hand administered such
severe punishment that the Aggie
fighter was clearly outclassed, and
Johnson was awarded the decision.
In an exceptionally fast extra
round fray, Fred Glover, Stanford,
defeated Clinton Jewett, Davis fea
ther. Glover's antagonist was by
far the toughest customer he had
ever been up against, but the In
dian's slashing hooks told the story
in the extra round.
Hugh Keenan, Stanford light
heavy, fought the best battle he has
entered in taking the decision from
George Lowrie in three rounds.
Keenan's swift, dancing footwork
kept him out of Lowrie's range
most of the time, while his punches
found their target on the Aggie
countenance oftener than ever be
fore.
Mark Kai-Kee scored the other
! Stanford victory by defeating M.
J Arrojado in the bantamweight bout,
i Both boys were clever and aggres-
I sive, but Kai-Kee had his man
! shaded throughout the three rounds.
Putting up a game fight, but los
. ing ground all the way, Jim Kelley,
! welter, lost a three-round decision
! to Captain Les Waight of the Aggie
varsity. Kelley was up against a
! superior and more experienced op
; ponent in Waight, who is considered
! the star of the Davis line-up
