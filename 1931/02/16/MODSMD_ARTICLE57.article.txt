# KEITH GLEDHIIL GETS FOURTEENTH POSITION IN NEW TENNIS RATING
## 
### 
Keith Gledhill, Stanford junior,
was ranked as tho 14th best tennis
player in the United States by the
1930 rankings of the United States
Lawn Tennis Association, issued
last Friday in New York City. Along
with Ellsworth Vines, Gledhill was
also placed at number five in -the
men's doubles ranking.
1 John Hope Doeg, captain-elect of
i the Stanford tennis team in 1930,
and present national tennis cham
pion in both singles and doubles,
! headed both these lists".
Present holder of number three in
the varsity rankings, Gledhill won
1 the national junior championship in
1929 after being runner-up in 1928,
I and was runner-up to Chandler in
'the 1930 California men's champion
jship.
He made his first Atlantic Coast
: invasion last summer, failing to
make the showing he was expected
to. This was due to the clay and
! grass courts of the East, to which
Gledhill s Western grip was not
1 adapted. He has since changed his
| grip and is looking forward to his
second Eastern invasion, scheduled
for the coming summer, which he
will probably start of! by playing in
the Intercollegiates at Philadelphia
along with the Stanford team.
