# RAINS, MUD CAUSE POSTPONEMENT OF CARD-BRONCO TILT
## Two Teams To Meet On Santa Clara Field Wednesday 
### Francis Lloyd 
Jupe Pluvius and Old Man River |
combined to make a mud puddle of j
the new varsity baseball diamond
Saturday afternoon, and the sched- !
uled conference opener between the
Indian nine and Santa Clara was ,
called off. The game will probably j
be played by a double header here
on February 28.
The cancellation of the game car- J
ried with it the postponement of J
the opening ceremonies of Stanford's
new ball orchard. The official cere- j
monies will now probably take place
here Saturday when Coach Wolter's
men take on the Saint Mary s out
fit.
Bronco Game Wednesday
Wednesday, the Redshirt varsity
journeys down the highway to the
wind-swept pasture of Santa Clara
for a nine-inning fracas. After play
ing on the new Stanford "tennis
court," the Indians will doubtless
feel the change of the Mission lot,
but should take the Bronco team
into camp anyway.
The question of Ralph Cook's eli- |
gibility is still the big worry of
Coach Wolter. If the star first-sack -
er is ruled out for the rest of the
quarter, Stanford's chances for the |
intercollegiate pennant will take a I
decided slump. At present, however, |
the outlook is bright for Cook's re- |
turn to the game in time for the j
Santa Clara struggle day after to
morrow.
Line-up Indefinite
Wolter's line-up for the coming
fracas is by no means definite. With
Cook out of the game, Hardy will
probably play on first, with either
Pihl or Miller behind the bat. Dan
Johnson seems to be the likely
starter on the mound, with Philippi,
Delmas, and Dykes Johnson in the
infield. Hunken and Campbell are
certain of playing in two of the outer
gardens, while the other is a toss
up between Riedo, Dixon, and
Wood worth.
Coach Walter Mails' Santa Clara
aggregation is a rather unknown
quantity, few of last year's veterans
remaining on the staff. Captain and
second - baseman "Swede" Harper,
Murray, shortstop, and Rowland,
outfielder, are the most experienced
men on the squad. "The Great'
Mails, however, has probably de
veloped a strong pitching staff.
