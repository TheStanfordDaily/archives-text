# STANFORD HITS GILROY Class Amazes Journalist VALLEY PAPER EDITED
## 
### 
The Saturday edition of the Gil- j
roy Evening Dispatch was published
by the Stanford class in editorial
management, under the guidance of
Professor Buford O. Brown and at
the invitation of Lloyd E. Smith,
; owner and publisher. Twelve mem
! bers.of the class did a creditable job
; of substitution for the regular staff
j to the surprise of Smith and them-
I selves.
The editorial staff - for - the - day
was headed by Philip Humphreys as
j managing editor; he was assisted by
Elmer Meadows as desk editor,
J Lowell Cox as telegraph editor, and
j Virginia Tanzey as sociely editor.
Despite complications caused by
! the non-arrival of three key mem
| bers of the reportorial staff due to
! an automobile breakdown, a good
deal of local news was uncovered
by those who did arrive. The reap
pearance of a Gilroy celebrity who
had been A.W.O.L. for a matter of
daj's, a full coverage of society
events, and a series of snappy edi
torials ranging from the guayule
crop to the shocking audacity of Ai
Capone were the chief features for
which the class was responsible. The
heralded interview with Sam Mac-
Donald, Gilroy oldtimer and grounds
! official at Stanford now, also ap-
I peared on the front page.
| CAvner-publisher Smith and Pro-
I fessor Brown both expressed them
| selves as completely satisfied with
! the results, while the members of
| the class report having had a great
| time on the unusual job.
The other members of the clgss
who completed the staff of copy
editors, reporters, and other news-
I paper necessaries were John Gilder
i sleeve, Abbott Roberts, Richard
; Rodda, Harriet Sutton, Paul Lorton,
I Frank Clough, Alfred Williamson,
1 and Ronald Rogers. Managing Edi-
I tor Humphreys felt that it would
be injudicious to reveal just which
members of the class failed to arrive
because of the breakdown.
