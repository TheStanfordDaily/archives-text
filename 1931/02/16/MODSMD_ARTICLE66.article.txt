# LAW COURT SAYS NOSE â€“ THUMBING RUDE BUT LEGAL
## 
### 
If your neighbor irks you,
don't thumb your nose at him.
It's not polite, although le
gally it is not a nuisance.
This seems to have been es
tablished by a decision handed
down by Professor George E.
Osborne, of the law school,
Thursday night in awarding
the decision in a moot trial to
John M. Cranston and Robert
A. Plume, attorneys for the
plaintiff, who were opposing
John P. Jennings anct Adron A.
Beene as attorneys for the de
fendant.
"Continued repetition of this
inelegant act transcended all
reasonable patience and con
stituted a nervous shock," the
plaintiff's attorneys declared in
opposing the defendant's > ef
forts to obtain a writ of ha
beas corpus which would
lease him from jail, wherein he
was placed after violating an
injunction restraining him from
thumbing his nose at his neigh
bor, the plaintiff.
Theoretically, the nose
thumber is probably still in
iail.
