Three Stanford swimmers will be
members of the Northern California
all-star water polo team that is be
ing organized to compete with all
star teams throughout the country
as part of the tryouts for the 1932
Olympic Games. The Indians so rec
ognized are Austin Clapp, member
of the 1928 Olympic Games relay
team and star sprinter on the var
sity squad, and Frank Booth and
Whitey Burns, aces of the water
polo varsity.
The date for the California-Stan
ford swimming meet has been ad
vanced from February 28 to March
7 to avoid a conflict of dates with
the first of these all-star games
which will be played between the
Northern California and Southern
California teams in Los Angeles on
February 27 and 28.
The National Intercollegiate Con
ference last week gave special per
mission to college mermen to com
pete in these games on teams with
club players, an act that would or
dinarily be a violation of eligibility
rules.
