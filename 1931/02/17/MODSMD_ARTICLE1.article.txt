# Varsity Hoopmen Shoot Blind-Fold In Practice Today
## Reggie Meade Will Probably Not Play in Varsity-Frosh Game; May Be Laid Up For The California Tilt; Bears Accurate on Long Shots FULL-TIME GAME WITH FRESHMEN TOMORROW A
						Three-Game Series To Be Played Next Year Between Varsity and Freshman Teams 
### JACK JERNEGAN 
DEST and diversion are the prescriptions which Coach John Bunn
ordered filled yesterday and today for the varsity basketball men.
Holding no practice at all yesterday, Bunn has announced a style of
workout for this afternoon which is distinctly new in local circles and
which should provide entertainment for the cagers; even if it has no
other effect. Chief among the features of practice today will be a blind
fold free-throw shooting contest for the members of the squad. Other
intriguing novelties on the program are "Crane and Crow." "100 per
cent" and "Twenty-one." Curious fans who would like to watch the
athletes enjoying these and other, unrevealed, pastimes will be dis-

appointed, however, since secret
practice is to be the rule every day
this week except tomorrow.
Frosh Game
Tomorrow Coach Bunn will spring
another innovation on the campus
basketball public. Instead of the
usual workout the varsity and fresh
man quintets will engage in a regu
lar full-time game with each other.
Refereed by Jimmy Bradshaw, the
contest will go the full 40-minuto
route and will be played under
strict competitive rules.
Meade, Moffatt, Reynolds, Baker,
and Fawcett are the probable start
ers for the varsity squad, and Top
ping, Maentz or Massey, Packard,
Jenkins, and Wright or Seaver will
open the action for the frosh.
This encounter is to be expanded
into a three-game series after this
year and made into an annual af
fair, played near the end of every

season. The bars will be let down
to admit any spectators who care
to witness the fray.
Meade Injured
Some doubt exists as to whether
Reggie Meade will play in the
frosh-varsity tilt, and it is possible
that he will not be in first-class
shape to face California Saturday.
The injury to his knee which he re
ceived last Saturday has been diag
nosed as a case of pulled tendons,
something which does not always
heal rapidly. If Meade does not see
action Tom Cordry will probably
take his place.
Study of the chart of the Cali
fornia game last Saturday reveals
how much the uncanny accuracy of
the Bear marksman on long shots
was responsible for their victory.
Out of-the 16 field goals made by
the Berkeley team one was a set-up
from under the basket; two were
shots from the foul line; and the
remaining thirteen were all from a
long way out in the middle or at
the side. This speaks well for the
Stanford defense, despite the final
score.
