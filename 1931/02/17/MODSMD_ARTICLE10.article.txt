# MME. RIOLA OFFERS LECTURE ON POMPEII
## 
### 
Mme. Riola, recently from Naples,
Italy, will lecture on Wednesday eve
ning at 8 o'clock in the basement of
the Women's Clubhouse before Chi
Nu Kappa, Classical Literature
Honor Society. The topic of the lec
ture, "Excavations at Pompei," is an
excellent one to be augmented by
the lantern slides that Mme. Riola
has brought along from Italy.
Chi Nu Kappa extends an invita
tion to all who arc interested to at
tend the lecture. It is impressed that
the talk to Chi Kappa will be the
only appearance of Mme. Riola in
the Bay region.
