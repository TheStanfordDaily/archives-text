IMACON. Ga., Feb. 16. (TP)—
All (he alcoholic liquor
everyone wants for a week,
distributed by all the filling
stations in the country, is Dr.
Bascom Anthony's idea of the
best way to popularize prohibi
tion.
"If I were King Bascom An
thony, Imperial Dictator of
these United States," the 75-
year-old circuit-rider of the
Methodist Church, South, told
a Baptist congregation here last
night, "I'd let everybody have
all they want for a week and
then issue a statement that I
would do the same thing in ten
years. I would be so besieged
with petitions that there never
would be any more doubt that
the prohibition law is a good
thing."
