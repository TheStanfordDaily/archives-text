# INDIAN LEADER TO MEET IRWIN
## Peace In India Now Rests On Ghandi's Decision 
### 
NEW DELHI, India, Feb. 16. (/P) •
Peace in India now rests in the
hands of Mahatma Gandhi, Lord
Irwin, the viceroy said today, for
the government is ready to concede
most of his demands if he will
agree to call oil his civil disobedi
ence campaign and give some evi
dence of a "change of heart—to
ward the government."
Lord Irwin has set aside all of
tomorrow and the next day for con
ferences with the picturesque little
man who is leading India's cam
paign for independence, and today
he spent several hours talking to
three influential Indian delegates to
the recent Round Table Conference
in London.
To Grant Amnesty
Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, who is
credited with having broken down
Gandhi's resistance to the point of
arranging a personal talk with the
viceroy, gave Lord Irwin his own
ideas of the situation in a meeting
also attended by Srimivasa Sastri
and M. P. Jayakar.
It was to them that Lord Irwin
said he was ready to grant amnesty
to the political prisoners in India
and to consider withdrawal of the
present laws against congress party
activities in Gandhi will make some
concessions on his side.
Brutality Charges
He is willing to start an inquiry
into charges of police brutality if a
prima facie case of brutality is es
tablished. thus reversing his stand
outlined in a l-eccnt reply to Gand
hi's letter asking such an inquiry.
He cannot, however, grant the na
tionalist demand for the right to
make salt, he said, for the salt laws
can be changed or repealed only
by the legislature.
