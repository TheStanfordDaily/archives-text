Sigma Nu's extra period victory
over Kappa Alpha by a one-point
margin was the feature of last j
night's intramural cage competition. |
Kennedy cinched the game for the j
victors with two clean shots through
the bucket duiing the hotly con- |
tested overtime play.
It was one of the tightest strug- |
gles of this year's intramural play,
with neither team enjoying more
than a two-point margin at any j
time. Buckets were scarce and
counted for a lot when made.
Sigma Nu Leads
Sigma Nu clung to a slender 4 to
2 lead at the half, but the Kappa
Alphas wiped that out on the tip-off j
for the second period. From there j
on both teams opened up and ran i
the count up to 11 points each when j
the final whistle sounded. In the j
overtime Hammans put a free throw
in the ring to add to the Kappa i
Alpha string.
Here Kennedy got in his deadly |
work for the Sigma Nu's by ringing |
two buckets in succession. Davis
came back with a long shot to make j
the score 15-14 at the finish. Davis
with 8 and Kennedy with 7 led in i
scoring.
Theta Chi's clash yith Encina V
proved little more than a stiff
workout for the Row team. After
chalking up a 13 to 6 lead in the
first half, the winners breezed eas- |
ily through the second frame. Zuger i
was hot under the basket for the '
Theta Chi's and accounted for
enough tip-ins to lead the van of
high-scorers with 12 markers. His '
teammate, Howe, peppered the net ;
with four shots that were good for |
8 points.
Game Forfeited
Kappa Sigma forfeited their con- J
test with Sequoia I while neither
team appeared for the scheduled
Beta Theta Pi-Alpha Delta Phi
game.

Campo-Phi Gamma Delta in the j

margin was the feature of last j
night's intramural cage competition. |
Kennedy cinched the game for the j
victors with two clean shots through
the bucket duiing the hotly con- |
tested overtime play.
It was one of the tightest strug- |
gles of this year's intramural play,
with neither team enjoying more
than a two-point margin at any j
time. Buckets were scarce and
counted for a lot when made.
Sigma Nu Leads
Sigma Nu clung to a slender 4 to
2 lead at the half, but the Kappa
Alphas wiped that out on the tip-off j
for the second period. From there j
on both teams opened up and ran i
the count up to 11 points each when j
the final whistle sounded. In the j
overtime Hammans put a free throw
in the ring to add to the Kappa i
Alpha string.
Here Kennedy got in his deadly |
work for the Sigma Nu's by ringing |
two buckets in succession. Davis
came back with a long shot to make j
the score 15-14 at the finish. Davis
with 8 and Kennedy with 7 led in i
scoring.
Theta Chi's clash yith Encina V
proved little more than a stiff
workout for the Row team. After
chalking up a 13 to 6 lead in the
first half, the winners breezed eas- |
ily through the second frame. Zuger i
was hot under the basket for the '
Theta Chi's and accounted for
enough tip-ins to lead the van of
high-scorers with 12 markers. His '
teammate, Howe, peppered the net ;
with four shots that were good for |
8 points.

test with Sequoia I while neither
