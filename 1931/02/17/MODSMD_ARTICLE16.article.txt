# Bauer Contrasts Music Lovers Here And Abroad
## 
### 
Explaining I he difference between
European and American music lov
ers, Harold Bauer, famous pianist
who is to lie heard here Thursday
night, says, "European people do not
go to concerts until they have some
kind of a musical education; here
they go, in the first place, from a
feeling of curiosity and a natural
intuition for music, which is stimu
lated by what, they hear, and the
desire to acquire a musical educat ion
is the result. It is this fact that
makes an American audience so
stimulating to artists who recognize
the responsibility which it brings.
War Question
"Before the war it would have
been difficult to say whether the
United States was more a theatre
loving or a music-loving country.
But the great question which eco
nomic conditions forced upon all
countries at that time had to be
answered: what could the nation dis
pense with and what was it neces
sary to keep? In America that choice
was made in an unmistakable fash

ion, and music of all forms and
quality developed as never before.
The war disclosed the full force of
the appeal which music has for peo
ple of the United States, and those
men and women who are sensitive
and intelligent listeners are doing
more than they realize to create a
soil favorable to the growth of mus
ical taste and the production of
musical composition."
Musical Education
That the great cultural force of
music appreciation continues to
grow and develop here, Bauer points
out, finds most convincing expres
sion in the rapidly increasing de
mand for musical education through
out the country, not only with pri
vate teachers but in our public
schools and other institutions of
learning.
"It is no small thing," he empha
sizes, "that the natural musical intui
i tion of our people should thus find
its outlet, and it is gratifying to ob
serve the fine talent that has stepped
forth from the ranks."
