## Thwarts Enemies By Bold Policy Conversion 
### 
MADRID, Feb. 16. (/P)—King Al
! fonso today made the daring politi
! cal gesture in an hour of crisis of
j inviting the enemies of his regime
J to help govern Spain and thereby,
j in the opinion of most political ob
| servers, saved the monarchy from
I the most menacing situation of re
[ cent history.
The medium of his invitation was
Jose Sanchez Guerra, a powerful
political opponent of Alfonso him
self, who tonight at the King's re
quest, was working to form a* minis
try to replace that headed by Da
maso Berenguer, which resigned
Saturday.

The royal gesture had an immedi
ate effect of restoring confidence.
The stock exchange had one of the
busiest sessions it has known for
months. Values rose generally and
bankers and business men expressed
an optimism that has been long ab
sent.
Sanchez Guerra's plan is a radical
one, and one that if it is successful
will strip the crown of much power
and privilege.
It contemplates first of all the
i freeing of political prisoners, ar-
I rested by the hundreds after the
| Republican revolts of last Decem-
I her. Then would come conversion of
j the new parliament into a constitu
-1 tional convention. The convention,
J Sanchez Guerra proposes, will de
| termine the future of Spanish gov
| ernment.
