# A 						LITTLE "SQUAWKING" ABOUT S.F. JOURNALISM

ifs ;i fine thing that San Francisco newspapers have he
come so Stanford-conscious in recent months. Ifs great
publicity, no doubt, for the I'niversity to have ils name
frequently shouted in the headlines of these metropolitan
newspapers.
Hut it's getting rather irri <11i 11 <4 for The Daily to find
itself deliberately misquoted again and again in these same
papers. Admitting that it is a long, long way from being
faultless, The Dail> still feels that if it has to be quoted it
deserves to be quoted correctly.
Latest of the manufactured quotations printed in San
Francisco newspapers and credited to The Dai.y editorial
column is the following excerpt, which appeared yesterday:
"... . particularly in the dribbling of a prominent California
player." The article referred to a Daily editorial criticising
the poor quality referecing in conference basketball games
this season. The Daily said nothing about the California
team or about any California player.
The Daily's only editorial references to last Saturday's
game with California were as follows: "The muttered
rumblings and outspoken protests concerning that officiat
ing must have been fully justified by the wretched exhibi
tion staged by the referees at the Hig (lame last Saturday.
.. . . No alibis are intended, inasmuch as The Daily believes
that competent officiating would not have affected the final
outcome of the con test."
II may be well and good for metropolitan papers to seek
to stir up friction between California universities and to ac
cuse them of unsportsmanlike attitudes 011 any provocation
whatsoever; but, if these papers are the high type journals
they claim to be, thev should either resort to some other
means than that of manufactured quotation to accomplish
their end or employ competent correspondents who are not
in the habit of making mis-statements.
