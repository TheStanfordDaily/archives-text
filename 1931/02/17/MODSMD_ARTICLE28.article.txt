To those students who 11 iiknown Hint foolish feeling
Hint comes after one tuts stood in ;i line outside the Old
l nion # waiting to purchase tickets lor campus dramatic
productions, and finally been allowed to buy two in the 2f>th
row, on the side, the recent change of policy announced by
the Dramatic Council comes as very good news indeed.
Heretofore, off-campus patrons had been allowed the
privilege of seem ing choice seals by mail before the tickets
were offered to the student public, because the Council be
lieved that those patrons constituted the bulk of the support.
A checkup on the attendance at the last two plays was made
bv A1 Denny, dramatic manager, and he discovered that
students made up more than half the audience.
So now students will also be accorded the privilege of
purehasing tickets before the general sale. To the Dramatic
(louncil, many thanks.
