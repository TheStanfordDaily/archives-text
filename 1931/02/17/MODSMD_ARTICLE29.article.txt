Slid < lays I wive nunc for our neighbor across llic bay.
Traditions are going hv Hie boards at Ihe I'niversily of
(California. Freshmen lliere are showing a disineliiwilion lo
wearing of "dinks," and, surprising though i! niav seem,
I hey are daring to smoke and "queen" on Ihe campus.
All lliis The Daily ('aliforiiian points oul in mournful
terms as il tiroes I lie sophomore class 011 to bigger and be tier
I hint's in the mailer of freshman discipline. II must have
been with real shame thai (California second-year men read,
"If means are not taken at once to justify the sophomores
in their weak enforcement, we can believe either of two
things: thai (California's hardy sophomore athletes are not
so hardy or the sophomore class is poorly led."
II was back about that Stanford decided ils sopho
mores had something better to do than spend their time
applying the water cure and simiSar treatments to those
freshmen who did not approve of the campus-dictated style
of I'rosh headwear and behavior. II was likewise thought
that freshmen might have more important duties to attend
lo than that of acting as subject matter for Ihe sophomore
treatments and experiments.
So. freshman hats were forgotten and freshman discip
line was abolished. Strangely, Ihe I'niversily has managed
lo get along quite well without these "traditions."
The editorial staff will meet in The Daily olT'icc at 1 ,
o'clock lodav.
