MORE ABOUT HONOR
The Editor, Sir: —
There is much fine talk about
honor. But when a thing outwears
its usefulness it is time to scrap it.
Efficiency dictates that.
The Honor Code, limping alon'g in
its decrepit way with the Men's
Council as a crutch, is ready for (he
junk-pile. Faculty members concede
it; students know it.
It is evident that a system that de
pends on "stool-pigeon" methods is
pretty likeiy to fail.
You do not "tell on" your fellows
in grade school.
You do not "tell on" your fellows
in high school.
Yet you are expected to turn ama
tuer sleuth at Stanford.
A good many students find it hard
enough to tread the straight path
themselves—they will pause before
they give an answer to "Am I my
brother's keeper?"
If the Honor Code used to work
it probably did so because of a dif
ferent environment. The aspect of
honor seems to change.
Men thought kerosene lamps were
an efficient means of lighting 30
years ago. Something hotter came.
People adopted it. There was no
cant, or hypocrisy regarding the "old
and traditional."
Invention and enterprise—not sob
bing sentimentalism and antiquated
technique solved our problems in the
past.
That proved economical as well as
sensible.
Someone discovered long ago that
if you go neither forward nor back
ward you stand still. Student leaders
cannot afford to go backward in this
problem. They stand still now, im
provising, bickering, hesitating—
what are they going to do?
If the present system is rotten, it
should not be and would not be if it
were changed.
Go ahead Mr. Men's Council and
Dr. Swain. Let's forget how nice
"honor" sounds, and get an efficient
substitute, proctoring, that will do
away with legerdermaine, duplicate
blue books, and class room chicanery.

MORE ABOUT HONOR
The Editor, Sir: —
There is much fine talk about
honor. But when a thing outwears
its usefulness it is time to scrap it.
Efficiency dictates that.
The Honor Code, limping alon'g in
its decrepit way with the Men's
Council as a crutch, is ready for (he
junk-pile. Faculty members concede
it; students know it.
It is evident that a system that de
pends on "stool-pigeon" methods is
pretty likeiy to fail.
You do not "tell on" your fellows
in grade school.
You do not "tell on" your fellows
in high school.
Yet you are expected to turn ama
tuer sleuth at Stanford.
A good many students find it hard
enough to tread the straight path
themselves—they will pause before
they give an answer to "Am I my
brother's keeper?"
If the Honor Code used to work
it probably did so because of a dif
ferent environment. The aspect of
honor seems to change.
Men thought kerosene lamps were
an efficient means of lighting 30
years ago. Something hotter came.
People adopted it. There was no
cant, or hypocrisy regarding the "old
and traditional."
Invention and enterprise—not sob
bing sentimentalism and antiquated
technique solved our problems in the
past.
That proved economical as well as
sensible.
Someone discovered long ago that
if you go neither forward nor back
ward you stand still. Student leaders
cannot afford to go backward in this
problem. They stand still now, im
provising, bickering, hesitating—
what are they going to do?
If the present system is rotten, it
should not be and would not be if it
were changed.
Go ahead Mr. Men's Council and
Dr. Swain. Let's forget how nice
"honor" sounds, and get an efficient
substitute, proctoring, that will do
away with legerdermaine, duplicate
blue books, and class room chicanery.
