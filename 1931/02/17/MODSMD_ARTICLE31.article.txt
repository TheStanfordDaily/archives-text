SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA —At (he Curran
Theatre.
Delicacy and precision, character
istic of Dobrowen's interpretations, |
were sustained throughout last Sun- >
day's popular concert. The program 1
opened with the rapid tuneful Mo- J
zart Symphony in E flat, followed
jby a tone poem "Zorohayda'' by |
j Svendsen, which somehow proved '
! rather dull. Two numbers from '
Mendelssohn's "Midsummer Night's
Dream"—the Nocturne and the deli- j
cate Scherzo—were played, the lat
ter especially well. The program
closed* in a heroic vein with Tschni- j
kowsky's musical dramatization of
Romeo and Juliet.
Next Friday and Sunday the pro- j
' gram includes Berlioz's "Benvenuto j
| Cellini," Beethoven's First Sym
j phony, and Stravinsky's "Petrouch
; ka," which is given for the first j
j time in San Francisco. —N. B.

THE SWEET SINGER OF MICHI
GAN. By Julia A. Moore. Pascal
Covici, Chicago. 192 X.
It is the first business of a re- |
viewer to discuss new books. It is
his double duty and pleasure to call 5
attention to less recent but possibly
better ones.
In the dedication of Ogden Nash's
last volume of light-headed verse
he gives honest credit to Mrs. Moore
(requiescat in pace) "without whose
collected works this little volume
could not have been written so |
quickly.!' The Nash quatrains owe
an obvious debt to the slightly less 1
lyric lines of Julia Moore.
Bad verse has rarely risen to such
awful depths. Mrs. Moore with
Emily Dickenson and Herman Mel
ville is enjoying a just resurrection.
Read "The Sweet Singer of Michi- |

gan." It is one of the few triumphs
of nature over art. —B. P.
A HISTORY OF MUSIC. By Grace
Gridley Wihn. Dodd, Mead. $3.00.
(At the Stanford Bookstore.)
After a shamelessly hurried perusal
of this volume one suggests that the
introduction, with its scientific dis
section of the spontaneity that is
music, seems slightly depressing,
and the content of the history proper
is dissatisfyingly uncritical.
Interesting through the grace of
brevity, it is, as the author hoped,
neither handbook of condensed in
formation nor reference book—rath
er something between the two.
On the whole, it presents an eas
ily read recital of familiar facts —
an ideal text for the beginner.
—J. S. S.
