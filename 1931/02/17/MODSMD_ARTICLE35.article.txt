The University of Cincinnati has
! built a "bumming room" for lazy
[ students. It is to be used as a gath
-1 ering place between classes where
| students can come and "do noth
! ing."
The name "bumming room"
would seem to apply to a room
that will be used as a cigarette
exchange for those who have
| "sworn off"—that is "sworn olT''
buying cigarettes.
The University of Colorado boasts
j a "Cactus Club." It would seem fit—
! ting that Stanford should have a
j "Cactus Club" to study the history,
the use, the legends, the apple
sauce, and the romance connected
with our own Cactus Gardens.
According to the University of
Texas inspiration is needed to make
j an education, study alone not being
1 enough.
Maybe that is why most col
leges feel that co-education is
desirable—the co-eds supplying
the inspiration and the men the
study; thus making a well
balanced educational plant.
But if the co-eds fail to inspire
the men ;ind the men fail to study,
i then co-education would seem to be
a failure.

i lowa may be the home of the
i corn-husker and the hog-caller but

|it seems things do happen there
I sometimes.
Men at Morningside College 1
(located in the Hawkcyc state)
have raised an objection be
cause co-eds appear for break
fast in pajamas.
Pajamas at breakfast may be an !
| outrage to masculine taste but how !
i about these "sandals" that we hear 1
I pattering all along the Quad?
The physical education depart- '
ment of the University of Nebraska (
has taken a stand against high heels
—claimed to be the delight of
<; sweet sixteen." In a campaign bear- !
ing the name, ''High Heels and (
Health," the department is urging |
co-eds to drop high heels.
One way that has proved very
effective at Stanford to abolish
high heels is to keep walks so
rough that only co-eds wearing
fiat shoes can manage to walk }
in safctv or comfort.
