IS IT RIGHT?
With huskcthall season Hear
ing a close, the matter of block
"S" awards will soon confront
the Ex Committee, and, more
particularly, a group of Indian
cagetnen wiio have worked
faithfully in the Pavilion since
early in the autumn quarter for
Stanford and for themselves. As
in every sport, there will be
thosp unsung heroes who were
not good enough to make the
five, hut who labored day in
and day out simply as material
upon which the first-string
players could practice to im
prove their basketball.
There can be no method of grant
ing letters which would give recog
nition to all (hose whose efforts de
serve praise. To the hoopmen with
the talent plus the industry to play
on the varsity quintet should go the
awards. In the case of basketball,
the block "S' is given to men who
have played at least half of the
conference playing time other than
.that against the Bears, OR at least
twenty minutes against the Blue and
Gold outfit. The basis for this rule
is evidently the contention that the
man playing the most time with the
team is most deserving of a letter.
We question this assumption.
The coach might consider worthy
of his letter a player who has com
peted less than the required time.
That man might have sat on the
bench for most of the season, but
in some important game might have
gone into the fray at an opportune
momen 1 and sunk a bucket, thereby
winning the contest and affecting
the standing of his team in the con
ference race. He could be a man of
unusual shooting ability, but too
poor in general floor work to de
serve a regular berth on the first
string five.
Let us illustrate with the case
of Reggie Meade in the last
U.C.L.A. tilt. Meade, having
gone into a slump due to ill
ness, had been warming the
bench ail season. With but three
minutes left to play against the
Bruins and the score deadlocked,
his accurate shooting was need
ed. Bunn sent him in; he got his
bucket, and those two points
proved to be the margin of vic
tory. Though Meade lias earned
his letter since by playing most
of the game against California
last Saturday, had he continued
to sit on the bench, he would
not have won his "S."
Baker has played IIS minutes
of conference play. He needs 120.
What he has played of the U.C.
games does not count in this total.
Unless he participates in» the com
ing Bear tilt long enough to bring
his total against California to 20
minutes, he will not deserve his let
ter according to the rule. And. too,
there are men who might have
played sufficient time, but are not
as deserving of the award as the
player in either of these illustra
tions. As evidence of this, on the
Indian bench at present arc two of
last year's lettermen whose rating
as reserves might well be disputed.
The matter comes to this,
then: that the coach should be
given the power to name the
men who should be awarded the
block "S." A good mentor plays
to win ball games, not to give
certain men time to (heir credit.
Yet he might think it unfair that
' a certain man lose the prize be
cause of the Ex Committee rul
ing. John Bunn is responsible
for the recent change in the
rules which reduced (he time
required against the Bears to
20 minutes instead of 30, as it
was formerly. Bunn has brought
new life to Farm basketball: he
has won a lot of tough ball
games. Is not he the one who
should decide which of his
hoopmen are responsible for
winning these contests?

Let us illustrate with the case
of Reggie Meade in the last
U.C.L.A. tilt. Meade, having
gone into a slump due to ill
ness, had been warming the
bench ail season. With but three
minutes left to play against the
Bruins and the score deadlocked,
his accurate shooting was need
ed. Bunn sent him in; he got his
bucket, and those two points
proved to be the margin of vic
tory. Though Meade lias earned
his letter since by playing most
of the game against California
last Saturday, had he continued
to sit on the bench, he would
not have won his "S."
Baker has played IIS minutes
of conference play. He needs 120.
What he has played of the U.C.
games does not count in this total.
Unless he participates in» the com
ing Bear tilt long enough to bring
his total against California to 20
minutes, he will not deserve his let
ter according to the rule. And. too,
there are men who might have
played sufficient time, but are not
as deserving of the award as the
player in either of these illustra
tions. As evidence of this, on the
Indian bench at present arc two of
last year's lettermen whose rating
as reserves might well be disputed.
The matter comes to this,
then: that the coach should be
given the power to name the
men who should be awarded the
block "S." A good mentor plays
to win ball games, not to give
certain men time to (heir credit.
Yet he might think it unfair that
' a certain man lose the prize be
cause of the Ex Committee rul
ing. John Bunn is responsible
for the recent change in the
rules which reduced (he time
required against the Bears to
20 minutes instead of 30, as it
was formerly. Bunn has brought
new life to Farm basketball: he
has won a lot of tough ball
games. Is not he the one who
should decide which of his
hoopmen are responsible for
winning these contests?
—Crawford.
IS IT RIGHT?
With huskcthall season Hear
ing a close, the matter of block
"S" awards will soon confront
the Ex Committee, and, more
particularly, a group of Indian
cagetnen wiio have worked
faithfully in the Pavilion since
early in the autumn quarter for
Stanford and for themselves. As
in every sport, there will be
thosp unsung heroes who were
not good enough to make the
five, hut who labored day in
and day out simply as material
upon which the first-string
players could practice to im
prove their basketball.
There can be no method of grant
ing letters which would give recog
nition to all (hose whose efforts de
serve praise. To the hoopmen with
the talent plus the industry to play
on the varsity quintet should go the
awards. In the case of basketball,
the block "S' is given to men who
have played at least half of the
conference playing time other than
.that against the Bears, OR at least
twenty minutes against the Blue and
Gold outfit. The basis for this rule
is evidently the contention that the
man playing the most time with the
team is most deserving of a letter.
We question this assumption.
The coach might consider worthy
of his letter a player who has com
peted less than the required time.
That man might have sat on the
bench for most of the season, but
in some important game might have
gone into the fray at an opportune
momen 1 and sunk a bucket, thereby
winning the contest and affecting
the standing of his team in the con
ference race. He could be a man of
unusual shooting ability, but too
poor in general floor work to de
serve a regular berth on the first
string five.
