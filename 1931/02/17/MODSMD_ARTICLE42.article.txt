# PRO AND CON TENNIS
## Wrestling Impresario Will Star Tilden and Kozeluh in Tennis Match at Madison Square Garden 
### Feg Murray, '16 
There's going to be some fun in
; Madison Square Garden, New York,
j the evening of February 18 when
; Jack Curley, wrestling impressario
Great Neck, puts on his first pro
i fessional tennis act, starring Big Bill
: Tilden, the Bad Boy of Tennis. Ti 1 —
| den will be meeting Karel Kozeluh,
; the Czeeho-Slovakian sleight-of
; hand artist, and it's just too bad
| (hat they aren't playing in the open
j tennis championship of the world,
! along with Richards, Cochet, La
! Coste, Doeg, Shields ,and Borotra,
| for that would be SOME FUN! But
| maybe that will come later,
Players like Tilden and "K" aren't
f getting any younger, however, Til—
| den having just passed his thirty-
I eighth birthday. Norman Brookes,
; (hat old Australian Wizard, could
1 still wield a mean racket at the ripe
-old age of forty, but that's aside
| from the question.
Richards in Doubles
Vinnie Richards, who turned Pro
i for "Cash and Carry" Pyle some

years ago, will be seen in the dou
bles on the evening of February 18,
I understand. Perhaps later he will
meet Tilden in singles. Vinnie vised
to trim Bill quite regularly anyway,
and he has been showing vast im
provement as a professional. I'd go
a long ways to see those old rivals
hook up again in mortal combat.
Richards is the present U.S. profes
sional champion, having beaten
Kozeluh in four sets at Forest Hills
last September.
Gives Good Show
Tilden and Kozeluh met in an in
formal match in Europe last year,
the American winning quite han
dily. The incomparable "K" always
gives a good show, being one of
ihose rare souls who seems to take
a tennis match lightly. He has been
known to kick a ball with his foot,
and after batting one high up in
the air with his racket, bounce it
deftly on his head as it fell. All in a
big match, too. Sort of a Court Jes
ter, this Kozeluh!

Richards in Doubles
Vinnie Richards, who turned Pro
i for "Cash and Carry" Pyle some

years ago, will be seen in the dou
bles on the evening of February 18,
I understand. Perhaps later he will
meet Tilden in singles. Vinnie vised
to trim Bill quite regularly anyway,
and he has been showing vast im
provement as a professional. I'd go
a long ways to see those old rivals
hook up again in mortal combat.
Richards is the present U.S. profes
sional champion, having beaten
Kozeluh in four sets at Forest Hills
last September.
Gives Good Show
Tilden and Kozeluh met in an in
formal match in Europe last year,
the American winning quite han
dily. The incomparable "K" always
gives a good show, being one of
ihose rare souls who seems to take
a tennis match lightly. He has been
known to kick a ball with his foot,
and after batting one high up in
the air with his racket, bounce it
deftly on his head as it fell. All in a
big match, too. Sort of a Court Jes
ter, this Kozeluh!
