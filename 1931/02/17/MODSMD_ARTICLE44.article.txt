By Fritz Goodwin
Track fans will have an oppor
tunity of watching Coach "Dink"
Templeton's 1931 Indian varsity in
s . -/us competition for the first time
this season Thursday afternoon,
when the entire squad will match
talents on the track and in the pits
at the annual interclass meet and
Irish Marathon.
Thursday's meet promises to pre
sent some of the most interesting
:wlries ever witnessed at an in- j
tersquad contest on the Farm. With
a team as well-balanced as the pres- i
ent Redshirt aggregation and as
formidable in several events, almost
anything may happen in such com
petition. With favorable weather
conditions and a solid track, spark
ling performances may be expected
: Thursday.
Dashes Promise Thrill
In the dash events, Hec Dyer and
Lcs Hables, both of '31, seem likely
to finish first and second in one
i order or the other, while Jim "Will —
J son, '34, and Ralph Giberson, 32, j
should be close on their heels for
third-place points. Hables finished
1 ahead of Dyer and Willson last Fri
day in the rain for a season record
of 9.8 seconds.
The 440, one of the strongest '
points in the 1931 varsity attack, 1
1 should develop into a thrilling race.
Ben Eastman, '33, will be the fa
vorite to take first in the event if !
he is entered. He will have no j
l cinch, however, in breaking the tape
j ahead of Ike Hables, '32, Maynor .
Shove. '31, and Jim Howell, '31.
Mile Should Be Good
The mile looks like a duel bc
; tween Bob Brown, '31, and Allan !
Storms, '31, although Manuel Aze- j
' vedo, a brilliant freshman miler, I
may break into either of the first |
two positions. Again in the hurdle 1
races, interest will center upon two j
seniors, Captain Podge Smith and j
A1 Nisbet, who never fail to run |
close, exciting barrier events.
Good individual performances are i
certain from Nellie Gray, '33, Here j
Laborcle, '33. and John Lyman, '34, -
in the shot put, wilh Gray the fore
most by virtue of past winning ■
marks. Bob Jones, '32, in the dis- j
I cus, Don Blackman, '33, high j
j jumper, John Parker, '31, and Paul |
Aebersold, '32, two-milers, and Art
: Zuger, '31, may also be counted I
1 upon as point-winners for their
separate "classes.

Ben Eastman, '33, will be the fa
vorite to take first in the event if !
he is entered. He will have no j
l cinch, however, in breaking the tape
j ahead of Ike Hables, '32, Maynor .
Shove. '31, and Jim Howell, '31.
Mile Should Be Good
The mile looks like a duel bc
; tween Bob Brown, '31, and Allan !
Storms, '31, although Manuel Aze- j
' vedo, a brilliant freshman miler, I
may break into either of the first |
two positions. Again in the hurdle 1
races, interest will center upon two j
seniors, Captain Podge Smith and j
A1 Nisbet, who never fail to run |
close, exciting barrier events.
Good individual performances are i
certain from Nellie Gray, '33, Here j
Laborcle, '33. and John Lyman, '34, -
in the shot put, wilh Gray the fore
most by virtue of past winning ■
marks. Bob Jones, '32, in the dis- j
I cus, Don Blackman, '33, high j
j jumper, John Parker, '31, and Paul |
Aebersold, '32, two-milers, and Art
: Zuger, '31, may also be counted I
1 upon as point-winners for their
separate "classes.

Track fans will have an oppor
tunity of watching Coach "Dink"
Templeton's 1931 Indian varsity in
s . -/us competition for the first time
this season Thursday afternoon,
when the entire squad will match
talents on the track and in the pits
at the annual interclass meet and
Irish Marathon.
Thursday's meet promises to pre
sent some of the most interesting
:wlries ever witnessed at an in- j
tersquad contest on the Farm. With
a team as well-balanced as the pres- i
ent Redshirt aggregation and as
formidable in several events, almost
anything may happen in such com
petition. With favorable weather
conditions and a solid track, spark
ling performances may be expected
: Thursday.
Dashes Promise Thrill
In the dash events, Hec Dyer and
Lcs Hables, both of '31, seem likely
to finish first and second in one
i order or the other, while Jim "Will —
J son, '34, and Ralph Giberson, 32, j
should be close on their heels for
third-place points. Hables finished
1 ahead of Dyer and Willson last Fri
day in the rain for a season record
of 9.8 seconds.
The 440, one of the strongest '
points in the 1931 varsity attack, 1
1 should develop into a thrilling race.
Ben Eastman, '33, will be the fa
vorite to take first in the event if !
he is entered. He will have no j
l cinch, however, in breaking the tape
j ahead of Ike Hables, '32, Maynor .
