### 
TUFVV YORK, Feb. IG. (/P)—A
J possible complication in the
recently resumed athletic rela
tions between Harvard and
Princeton appeared today in
the decision of Yale athletic
authorities t«» end its football
season against these two rivals
in alternate years instead of
having Harvard as a final op
ponent annually.
The revised Yale football
schedule calls for Yale to meet
Harvard November 21 this fall
a/id Princeton on November
28. The rotating schedule lias
long been favored by Prince
ton, and this one condition
must be considered in any pro
posals to resume football rela
tie is with Harvard. Princeton
and Harvard agreed last week
to resume relations except in
football.
The Harvard Crimson editor
ialized today: "Between friends,
reasons must be frankly stated.
Yale is obligated to explain
this action."
The Yale Daily News obliged:
"Yale has discriminated against
Princeton for a long time. She
now considers Princeton as a
legitimate rival on the same
basis as Harvard."
