## Place Of Women In Modern World Is Topic 
### 
Dr. Lorine Pruette, widely known
psychologist, will speak tonight on
"Women in the Modern World' in
the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman of the Stan
ford psychology department, who has
heard her, says, "She is a very pleas
ing lecturer. She speaks very easily
and interestingly, not oratorically,
and with a touch of humor."
Dr. Pruette is considered one of
the more alert and capable analysts
of American phychology today, com
bining wide learning and extensive
observation with provocative and
stimulating interpretations of our
leading contemporary problems. In
writing to her, Dr. Joseph Peterson
of the George Peabody College for
Teachers, has said, "You have en
tered a field that is very important,
one that you should continue to
hammer and hammer at until you
see more women waking up to their
opportunity."
Besides being a leading psycholo
gist and an able lecturer. Dr. Pruette
shows versatility in writing. She is
the author of scientific articles,
stories and poems. Her latest work
is a romantic novel, "Saint In Ivory,"
a story of the patron saint of Paris.
Her first book, "Women and Leisure,
a Study of Social Waste," is now a
standard reference, while her biog
raphy of G. Stanley Hall is consid
ered one of the best biographies ever
written, showing a very keen psy
chological insight.
Dr. Pruette attaches great import
ance to the open discussion at the
close of her lectures. The program
is being given under the auspices
of the Committee on Public Exer
cises. The public is invited.
