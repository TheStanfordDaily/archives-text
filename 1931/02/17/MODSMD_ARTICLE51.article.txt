# Card Nine To Meet Broncos Tomorrow
## Pasture-Like Diamond of Missions To Be Sight of Game; Dan Johnson and Pihl Stanford Battery 
### 
ITNLESS there is another exhibition of California weather about which
there has always been a strict press censorship, the Stanford nine will
come to Krips tomorrow with the Santa Clara Broncos at 2:150 o'clock on
the latter's own back-yard where agricultural endeavors go on, much to
the anguish of the outfielders. Ralph Cook, star sackcr, is still
declared ineligible and will not be able to compete Wednesday against
the Mission outfit. Yesterday's practice saw Spud Hardy scooping them
up around the initial sack. Hardy is slated to start the Santa Clara game

- and is capable of filling the assign
■ ment in competent fashion.
Eddie Fielder
Because of his marked ability,
Jim Eddie has been chosen by Wol
j ter to start the game at right field.
' In the two games played thus far
j Eddie has smacked the horsehide
i with telling effect. However, j\s
| Eddie's main job is hurling, a regu
| lar right fielder will eventually bo
| chosen from Dixon, Russ, Stine, or
I Woodworth.
! The receiving post has been given
; to Don Pihl, who will gather in the
j fast-breaking curves of the Indian
ace, Dan Johnson. Art Miller will
j very likely play part of the game
j against the Brones, as the catching
I position is far from permanently
, decided. Lawrence and Livermore
I are two other catchers who have
been coming along fast in practice
lately and will no doubt be heard
j from soon.
Coaches Old Stars
Two major league stars, of not

'in 1914 was one of the leading
| hitters in the American League
[ while playing for the Boston Red
Sox, is now guiding the destiny of

Mails will be in the Santa Clara
dugout, which situation may or may
not remind him of *"the good old
days'' with the Giants.

Coaches Old Stars
Two major league stars, of not
1 so long ago, will be sitting in op
j posing dugouts when* the Indian-
Bronco baseball party gets under
! way tomororw. Harry Wolter, who
'in 1914 was one of the leading
| hitters in the American League
[ while playing for the Boston Red
Sox, is now guiding the destiny of
! the Farm's nine. Walter "the Great '
Mails will be in the Santa Clara
dugout, which situation may or may
not remind him of *"the good old
days'' with the Giants.
The starting lineups are as fol
| lows: Stanford, Johnson, p.; Pihl, c;
Hardy, lb; Philippi, 2b; Johnson, 3b;
Delmas, ss; Hunken, If; Campbell,
! cf; Eddie, rf.
For Santa Clara, Thomas, p;
' Morey, c; Lee, lb; Harper, 2b; Stu
i art, 3b; Murray, ss; Rowland, If;
1 Long, cf; Farrell, rf.
ITNLESS there is another exhibition of California weather about which
there has always been a strict press censorship, the Stanford nine will
come to Krips tomorrow with the Santa Clara Broncos at 2:150 o'clock on
the latter's own back-yard where agricultural endeavors go on, much to
the anguish of the outfielders. Ralph Cook, star sackcr, is still
declared ineligible and will not be able to compete Wednesday against
the Mission outfit. Yesterday's practice saw Spud Hardy scooping them
up around the initial sack. Hardy is slated to start the Santa Clara game

- and is capable of filling the assign
■ ment in competent fashion.
Eddie Fielder
Because of his marked ability,
Jim Eddie has been chosen by Wol
j ter to start the game at right field.
' In the two games played thus far
j Eddie has smacked the horsehide
i with telling effect. However, j\s
| Eddie's main job is hurling, a regu
| lar right fielder will eventually bo
| chosen from Dixon, Russ, Stine, or
I Woodworth.
! The receiving post has been given
; to Don Pihl, who will gather in the
j fast-breaking curves of the Indian
ace, Dan Johnson. Art Miller will
j very likely play part of the game
j against the Brones, as the catching
I position is far from permanently
, decided. Lawrence and Livermore
I are two other catchers who have
been coming along fast in practice
lately and will no doubt be heard
j from soon.
