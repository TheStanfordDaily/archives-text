# EINSTEIN, CLARA BOW Campus Guests Of Walton TO APPEAR FOR CLASS
## 
### Lowell Cox 
Einstein and Millikan are on the
campus, guests of Instructor Albert
Walton, preparing for their appear
ance tomorrow morning before the
instructor's Psychology 51 class.
The famous pair will participate
in an experiment designed to
demonstrate conditioning and the
trial and error process of learning.
By way of contrast, Clara Bow and
Daisy DeVoe will also appear before
the class, attacking without previous
training a problem designed by Wal
ton.
The experiment was first sched
uled to have been held last week,
but owing to an injury suffered by
Einstein last Thursday, it had to be
postponed.
In preparing for the experiment,
Einstein was attacking a particu
larly difficult feature of the prob
lem, when he received an accidental
but severe blow on the head from
Millikan.
Einstein was just entering a
chamber, in which a teeter-totter
was located, as Millikan was leav
ing. The heavy plank came down
with a crash on Einstein's head, and
as a result it was some time before
Walton could get the latter to go
on with the experiment.
Walton at first intended to train
Clara and Daisy in the intricacies
of the problem, which is an elabor
ate maze, but Clara exhibited too
low an intelligence quotient.
In commenting on the four princi
pals of his experiment, however,
Walton said last night Ihat he has
never worked with white rats who
showed greater eagerness to co
operate.
