# NAVY PLANS SHOW AT LAUNCHING OF NEWEST DIRIGIBLE
## Thousands Will View First Flights Of Ship Over Akron Airport 
### 
AKRON, 0., Feb. 1(5 OP).— I The
Akron Municipal Airport is to have
the appearance of a war-time can
tonment when the United States
Navy, some time this summer, stages
one of its biggest shows —the launch
ing and putting into flight of the
new dirigible Akron.
Preliminary preparations for the
big show are being made by Lieut.
T. G. W. Settle, senior naval inspec
tor at the huge Goodyear-Zeppelin
dock, where the Akron is being con
structed. Lieut. Settle had charge of
the landing of the Graf Zeppelin at
Los Angeles during the world flight
and consequently is fully familiar
with the magnitude of the job.
The show may run over several
weeks, covering the several trial
flights. Thousands of spectators are
expected to be cn hand day and
night, when the ship emex-ges from
the shed for the first time. It is
planned to construct a substantial
fence, for four miles around the air
port. Augmenting the fence will be
approximately 500 guards, encamped
nearby. As the municipal airport
lies in a saucer-shaped bowl, the
surrounding low hills will provide
stadium vantage points for specta
tors. The airport itself will be kept
entirely clear for handling the air
ship.
The date of the first test flight
of the ship will not be determined
in advance but will depend upon
weather conditions at the time, Lieut.
Settle says. It might take place in
the middle of the night.
