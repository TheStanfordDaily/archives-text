# STANFORD DEBATE SPEAKERS OPPOSE NAZARENE COLLEGE
## Nations' Free Trade Policy Is Question; Stanford Has Affirmative 
### 
Stanford upheld the affirmative in
| a debate with the Northwest Naza
rene College last night in the Little
Theatre on the question, "Resolved,
; that the nations should adopt a pol
| icy of free trade." Frank L. Fullen
wider *nd David J. McDaniel, Car
dinal sophomores, argued against
i Theodore Martin and George Tay
i lorson of the northern school.
The affirmative contended that
| free trade would do away with
both external and internal friction.
! They maintained that unless a sys
tem of free trade is established, the
! European nations will not be able
I to pay their debts. They also pointed
I out that the tariff makes the price
lof poor local products as high as
| that of good foreign products, and
' that under a tariff the farmer often
| sells to an unprotected market and
I buys from a protected one.
The negative stressed the fact that
the tariff does not keep foreign com-
I petitors out, but merely puts them
, on the same basis as local manufac
-1 turers. They said that a system of
free trade is impractical because it
is impossible for the nations to make
i satisfactory trade agreements, and
j that it is unsound because it opens
J the door to monopolies.
