### 
I EGAL difficulties in yesterday's class elections caused the Executive
Committee at its regular weekly meeting held last night to accept
only the election returns of the 1932 and 1934 classes and the returns on
the position of junior member of the committee.
William Doub polled a plurality over his opponent, Ernest Hatch, to win
the office of junior member of the Ex Committee. Ed Boyles, Stan Mad
den, and William Mearns were elected to the positions of junior class

president, vice-president, and seere- '
tary, respectively.
Stark Heads Frosh
The office of freshman class presi
dent was won by Bill Stark, while
Bruce Tarver was elected vice
president and Jeanne Millard, sec
retary.
Election results for the sophomore
and senior classes were held up be
cause the A.S.S.U. constitution fails
to state whether or not "write in"
votes in revote elections are legal.
According to Stewart Stadler, chair
man of the election board, the ques
tion came up when Burnell Gould
received 41 "write in" votes for the
position of senior class president.
Seven "write in" votes for Les Walls
for the position of sophomore class
vice-president brought up the same
question in the i;econd-year class
voting.
Law Faculty Decides
In order to settle the matter, the
Ex Committe decided to plafce the
matter before members of the law
school faculty to determine the le
gality of the "write in" votes.
In addition to the election discus
sion, the Ex Committee granted the
following dates: Kappa Kappa Gam
ma "7-8," February 18; Roble Club
"7-8," February 25; Sigma Kappa
"7-8," February 26; Dramatic Coun
cil's Junior Opera, April 17.
