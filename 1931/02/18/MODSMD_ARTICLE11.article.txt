# SENATE FAVORS VETERANS' LOAN
## Smoot Believes Bill Will Pass Over Veto 
### 
! WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (/P). â€”'The
veterans loan bill tonight was headed
for precipitate passage in the Senate
with the administration forces over
whelmed by a stampede that swept
across the Capitol from the House.
The measure had barely reached
the Senate chamber from the House
when Senator Ashurst, Democrat,
Arizona, moved to take it up. Block
ed by the rules, he entered a .motion
:to discharge the finance committee
! from the consideration and said he
| would ask a vote tomorrow.
Pleads for Time
I Pleading for regular procedure,
Chairman Smoot, of the finance
committee and Senators Watson, of
Indiana, and Reed, of Pennsylvania,
the ranking Republicans, said the
committee had a right at least to
! read the bill and consult with Sec
-1 retary Mellon regarding it.
The chairman has called a meet
j ing of the committee for tomorrow
! to take up the measure, at which
| meeting he will ask Mellon to ap
-1 pear. Smoot late in the day called
upon President Hoover.
Concedes Early Action
He conceded that the measure
! which permits veterans to borrow
i up to 50 per cent of the face value,
!of their bonus certificates, would
! be quickly passed by "the Senate and
| probably would pass over a veto.
However, Smoot said he had no idea
| of the attitude of the President to
! ward the bill.
A band of 27 war veterans reached
the capitol today from Seattle,
; Washington, to add their plea for
prompt action by the Senate. They
called upon Senator Dill, Democrat,
Washington.
