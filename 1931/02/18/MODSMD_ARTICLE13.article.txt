16 score.

gains the right to play Sequoia I for

S.A.E. Foul Shots Poor
Inability to make foul shots good
cost S.A.E. the game. Out of nine
chances from the free throw line
they were only able to sink two in
the ring. Lee had a chance to win
the game for the S.A.E.'s when he
was presented with two free shots
a few seconds before the finish of the
sti uggle.
The Row team depended on a
sucker shot game, taking their time
and waiting for the breaks. Los
Arcos played a wide open style and
depended on connecting with their
long shots for the victory.
Fry collected six of the S.A.E.'s
point total, while Madden played an
outstanding game for the club and
garnered 8 markers to lead the eve
ning's high scorers.
