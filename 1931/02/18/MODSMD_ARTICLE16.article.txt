# Encina Hall "Low Down" Given In Terms Of Food
## 
### 
Encina Hall and the four eating
clubs attached to the same kitchen
bid fair to their way to fame,
if figures gathered by Mrs. Hilda
Watson, in charge of the Encina
Commons, and Christine Ricker, di
rector of dining halls, are proof.
These quantities are calculated on
the basis of food consumed during
an average three quarters. Here
they are envisioned:
Milk amounting to 68 tons, or
enough to fill a swimming pool 20
feet square and five feet deep.
Sufficient apples, if eaten one a
da v v, to keep the doctor away for
nearly 150 years; or, if thrown out
of an Encina bull pen window by an
energetic freshman at the rate of
one per minute, they would last
him more than a school quarter if
he stayed on the job continuously
ten hours a day.
Now let us consider lettuce. It has
been found that the 111,104 heads
consumed in a year, if planted in a
row two feet apart, would stretch

from here to Redwood City, some
five miles.
A herd of 3fi steers is gobbled up
each year by Ihe Encina Common
ers, as well as thousands of pounds
each of lamb, veal, and ham.
The seven tons of butter devoured
at the Commons would build an
eight-foot wall 150 yards in cir
cumferance to corral the herd.
If salad oil could supply the lubri
cation needs of a Ford, and the
amount annually running down the
throats of hungry Encina diners
could be fed to nine deserving
mechanical contraptions of the i
above description, it would suffice
to run them each some 70,000 miles,
provided four quarts of fresh oil
were administered every 1,000 miles.
If all the eggs laid for Encina
were shot from a machine gun at
the rale of three per second, the
process of scrambling would have
to continue for almost ten and a
half hours before the supply would
be exhausted.
