# Modern Woman Should Be Able To Earn Living
## Women Seldom Have Wives Says Lecturer 
### 
Dr. Lorine Pruette, speaking very
interestingly and with a touch of
humor in the Little Theatre last
night on "Women in the Modern
World," expressed the opinion that
it is very dangerous for a girl today j
to be married before she has had j
some experience in earning her own j
living. "There is no assurance in
matrimony now," Dr. Pruette said.
"The older women who are left after
a few years of dependent married
life to make their own way are in a
most desperate situation. They don't
know how to do anything, and the
demand today is for youth. More
over, the girl who has had some
business experience will be a more
tolerable wife and more helpful to
her husband when he has come
home from a bad day at the office.
Several reasons why women do
not succeed as well as men were
given by Dr. Pruette. "First, women
do not have to succeed. Men are
forced to make a living, regardless
of unpleasant conditions. Women
are the greatest inventors of alibis.
We have certainly overstressed
them."
That their men do not want them
to succeed is a third reason, which,
according to Dr. Pruette, men are
unwilling to admit. Men are very
much disturbed when their wives
are. doing better in business than
they. But, Dr. Pruette pi'ophesies,
"Women are going to stop standing
between men and their inferiority
complexes. Then we will have to
develop a new type of man."
"Women seldom have wives," was
the rather unusual fourth reason
given by Dr. Pruette. She explained
that it is usually the wife protecting
the husband from the petty details
that insures his success. The last,
but very important cause of the less
noticeable success of women, is that
they lead such contingent lives.
"The main value any college can
give," said Dr. Pruette, "is to create
a joy in working and develop a
feeling for workmanship. Then the
women will get the satisfaction they
need out of working and will be
concerned in putting the job over
and not trying to please some par
ticular individual."
