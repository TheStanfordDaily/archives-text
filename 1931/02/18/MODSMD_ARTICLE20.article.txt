# Speegle Holds For Control Over Honor System By Council
## Men's Council Control Over Honor Violations Asked By Speegle, New Secretary of Men's Ruling Body, in Interview Yesterday 
### 
J F retention of the Honor Code is wanted, Men's Council must have
unrestricted jurisdiction over its enforcement," Paul Speegle, new
secretary of the body, declared yesterday. Speegle stated that a "half
way" attitude of the faculty toward the council is "entirely unsatisfactory."
and that if faculty control over the council develop, the jurisdiction
should be removed from the council. In maintaining advocation of strict
enforcement of the Code, Speegle insisted that the council, as a student
organization, should be entitled to full control over its own actions and

decisions, and he appealed to the
students for support of the Code.
At the same time, the council
secretary presented the proctor sys
tem as a substitute if the students
do not wish to keep the honor sys
tem. From his remarks, however,
inference is drawn that lie favors
the Honor Code to the proctor sys
tem.
The text of his statement follows:
Council Freedom Stressed
"Keeping the honor system means
that Men's Council must be allowed
freedom to enforce its decisions. It
must not develop into a deliberative
body, whose decisions are subject
to faculty approval, and it must not
be used by the faculty as a buffer in
its relations with the students. It
is necessary that the council have
full power to determine its own
views on the subject in question,
and it must be free to put into effect
whatever decisions it renders.
"A half-way atitude of the fac
ulty toward the council is entirely
unsatisfactory. We must have either
full support or complete removal
of jurisdiction over Honor Code
violations.
Favors Enforcement
"I am in favor of strict enforce
ment of the Code, and am con
vinced that the only equitable means
of enforcing it is through Men's
Council. The view is sometimes ex
pressed that the council is, after all,
composed of students charged with
the judging of other students. That
is true, but since the council is a
student organization, created by the
students themselves, it is entitled to
full control over its own actions and
decisions.
"Expulsion of a student for an
honor violation is a heavy responsi
bility, but the council must be al
lowed to take even this step when
it proves necessary for the mainten
ance of honor in academic work.
Defines Enforcement
! "Enforcing the Honor Code does
| not mean that Men's Council wants
I everyone to go into his examina
[ lions for the expi-ess purpose of spy
! ing on his neighbor; rather, an atti
! tude should be maintained whereby
one takes it for granted that the
I students in his particular class are
I honest until their actions show them
[ to be otherwise.
"If the students want to keep the
honor system, well and good; if they
| don't, substitute a proctor system.
! However, I don't believe that those
I who have agitated most strenuously
j for a proctor system actually realize
what it would mean.
"The council welcomes any criti
| cism of a constructive nature, but
the recent deluge of rhetorical let
ters appears, for the most part, ut
terly without value."
