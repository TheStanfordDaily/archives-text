# FROSH BATTLE VARSITY COURT QUINTET TODAY
## Fans Assured Real Game When Teams Meet In Annual Contest REGULARS TO START Bunn To Coach Yearlings During Struggle 
### Stewart Crawford 
Fans who wander over to the Pa
vilion any time after 4 o'clock this
afternoon are likely to find a battle
royal going on in the form of a
basketball game between the var
sity and freshman quintets. Regular
20 minute halves, referees, score
boards, water buckets, and all the
rest of the paraphenalia which in
dicate that an orthodox hoop iilt is
in progress will be in evidence.
Bunn is going to coach the fresh
men, while the varsity five will be
under its own management. Both
outfits will be out to win, and will
start their strongest combinations.
Varsity Favored
Naturally favored to down the
yearlings, the varsity cage ai'tists
may find themselves up against some
very tough competition. That the
coach is running the babes seems
to indicate that the object is to de
feat the older men. Though it is
not probable that the first year
hoopstel's will triumph, they will at
least put up a very interesting bat
tle.
In the first place, the youngsters
will have it all over the varsity in
height. Packard, six-foot four cen
ter, should easily control the tipoff
over Mike Reynolds. Jenkins and
Wright, both tall yearling guards,
could probably win a game of take
away from Cordry and Moffatt any
day, while Kuechler, with his six
feet six inches of skin and bone,
could easily step clear over Tyler in
one stride.
Topping Helps Frosh
If Topping is anywhere near as
"hot" as he was against the Bear
Cubs last Saturday night when he
scored 16 points, it will behoove
Messrs. Rintala and Fawcett at the
guard positions to keep him far
away from the bucket, for once the
lanky babe forward gets as close as
the foul line, he just stretches a little
and drops one through.
Figuring this an excellent oppor
tunity to put his basketeers through
quite a strenuous scrimmage with
the interest of competition to pre
vent them from going stale, Bunn is
using this game to keep the offense
of the Indians in fighting trim for
the final and deciding Bear tussle
up in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
urday night.

away from Cordry and Moffatt any
day, while Kuechler, with his six
feet six inches of skin and bone,
could easily step clear over Tyler in
one stride.
Topping Helps Frosh
If Topping is anywhere near as
"hot" as he was against the Bear
Cubs last Saturday night when he
scored 16 points, it will behoove
Messrs. Rintala and Fawcett at the
guard positions to keep him far
away from the bucket, for once the
lanky babe forward gets as close as
the foul line, he just stretches a little
and drops one through.
Figuring this an excellent oppor
tunity to put his basketeers through
quite a strenuous scrimmage with
the interest of competition to pre
vent them from going stale, Bunn is
using this game to keep the offense
of the Indians in fighting trim for
the final and deciding Bear tussle
up in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
urday night.
