# THE 						FUNCTION OF EXAMINATIONS

A( Ihe t'niversity of California at Los Angeles, examina- i
lions came in for (heir usual attack just before the close of
the semester. The Daily lirtiin, however, rallied to the de
fense o!' the system, maintaining that "in a very practical)
sense examinations are a preparation for the more severe!
tesls of the non-collegiate world, which every student will
he entering in a few years In the examinations of the j
world, there will he the same psychological tenseness, multi
plied many limes; there is the same last-minute review of
personal knowledge and abilities, before the oral blue-book
is opened for the employer, buyer, or critic.
"II has been said that college work is more learning how j
lo study, than memorizing vital facts, ('ollcye examinations \
similarly should leach how lo 'cram' and how to work in the ;
lesl, rather than stand merely as an obstacle to the attain-;
men I of the* degree."
In stressing what is merely an accidental feature of col-1
lege examinations, our southern contemporary erred. It isj
false to assume that because practice in taking examina
tions may aid in acquiring a deftness in "cramming," ex
aminations should be designed toward the fostering of that j
deftness.
Kxaminations are simply an expedient way to meet the i
problem of judging whether students are able profitably to
undertake more advanced work. Examinations arc not the
perfect method of meeting this problem, nor are they of-j
fered simply as hurdles upon which to practice before at-:
tempting the hurdles of post-collegiate life.
President Walter Dill Scott of Northwestern University j
recently emphasized a similar point when he said: "The,
function of the professor is to develop intellectual interests
l ather than to provide dillicult hurdles."
That examinations tend to encourage "cramming" is
one of their defects. I bis is recognized in some univer
sities, where frequent specific reviews, which most en-1
courage "cramming," are replaced by a few broad and!
comprehensive examinations covering the year's work.
Ideally, perhaps the best system is that proposed bv i
those who advocate much smaller class groups than at j
present, in which each instructor knows personally every
student under him and can fairly accurately determine!
through this personal contact whether a student is lit to!
proceed to more advanced work.

world, there will he the same psychological tenseness, multi
plied many limes; there is the same last-minute review of
personal knowledge and abilities, before the oral blue-book
is opened for the employer, buyer, or critic.
"II has been said that college work is more learning how j
lo study, than memorizing vital facts, ('ollcye examinations \
similarly should leach how lo 'cram' and how to work in the ;
lesl, rather than stand merely as an obstacle to the attain-;
men I of the* degree."
In stressing what is merely an accidental feature of col-1
lege examinations, our southern contemporary erred. It isj
false to assume that because practice in taking examina
tions may aid in acquiring a deftness in "cramming," ex
aminations should be designed toward the fostering of that j
deftness.
Kxaminations are simply an expedient way to meet the i
problem of judging whether students are able profitably to
undertake more advanced work. Examinations arc not the
perfect method of meeting this problem, nor are they of-j
fered simply as hurdles upon which to practice before at-:
tempting the hurdles of post-collegiate life.
President Walter Dill Scott of Northwestern University j
recently emphasized a similar point when he said: "The,
function of the professor is to develop intellectual interests
l ather than to provide dillicult hurdles."
That examinations tend to encourage "cramming" is
one of their defects. I bis is recognized in some univer
sities, where frequent specific reviews, which most en-1
courage "cramming," are replaced by a few broad and!
comprehensive examinations covering the year's work.
Ideally, perhaps the best system is that proposed bv i
those who advocate much smaller class groups than at j
present, in which each instructor knows personally every
student under him and can fairly accurately determine!
through this personal contact whether a student is lit to!
proceed to more advanced work.
