# UNWELCOME DOLLARS
## 
### 
Harvard and Yale, (lolumbia and Princeton wore each i
awarded $25,000 by llic will of Albert K. Pillsburv, former i
Massachusetts atlorney general. The stipulation was that
the money should be used by the universities to combat j
feminism. Kach of the four universities politely declined!
Ihe privilege of spending *25,000 of someone else's money I
for that purpose.
Sylva Weaver, \'JO, as women's editor of The Daily, I
pleaded for $10,000,000 to put the Five Hundred on aj
numerically equal b;isis with Stanford men. The quota (
has not yet been reached.
Obviously, Mr. Pillsbury's executors cannot use his un
welcome dollars in furthering the interests of the Five Ilun
dred. ljut their dillieullies may suggest a solution to po
tential willdrawers of 19151. We have yet to reach the time
when checks payable to Stanford ( diversity ill be de-!
clined, even politely!
