# Famous Pianist Started Career On Russian Tour
## Bauer To Present Concert Here Tomorrow 
### 
The death of p. Russian Czar was
the turning point in the life of
Harold Bauer, .celebrated pianist.,
who will play here in the Pavilion
at 8:20 o'clock tomorrow night.
Bauer had begun his musical
career as a violinist, after playing
the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto
with a London orchestra at the age
of ten. His family was well-known
in English musical circles and as a
boy he had also studied the piano.
At the time of the Czar's death he
was engaged to accompany a singer
on a tour in Russia and to play
violin .solos to fill out the program.
Owing to the strict Court mourning
which followed the Emperor's death,
no public concerts could be given
in the principal cities and the ma
jority of the youthful violinist's
performances were given in small
towns on a semi-private basis. How
ever, no accompanist could be found
for him in such places and he was
compelled to substitute piano solos
to complete the program. Later,
when the ban was lifted, the man
ager decided that, in the larger cities
as well as the smaller ones, Bauer
could play the piano well enough
for his purposes and the expense of
another accompanist would be
spared.
It was at this time that Paderew
ski heard him play and convinced
him that his greater talent was for
the piano. Three years of study
prepared him for debuts in Berlin,
London, and Paris that assured his
future success.
Bauer is happy to enjoy both the
devotion of the musical public and
that of his colleagues. Long the
president of the Beethoven Associa
tion in New York City, he was also
decorated with the Legion of Honor
by the French Government in recog
nition of his valuable services in the
cause of French music. Both De
bussy and Ravel have been his
friends, the former choosing him to
play for the first time his newly
completed "Children's Corner," and
the latter dedicating to him one of
his own compositions, "Ondine."
Tickets for the concert tomorrow,
which is to be given under the aus
pices of the A.S.S.U. Concert Series,
may be purchased at the concert
series office in the Old Union or at
the Pavilion box office immediately
before the concert.
