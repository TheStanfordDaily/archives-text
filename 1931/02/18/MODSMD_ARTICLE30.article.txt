Tliiil great old romancer, heller ih. ,v called charlatan, |
(iabriele d'Annunzio, Italy's poet-patriot, continues to an-!
nounce his plans for an elaborate death. Some time since,
he announced his plan to have himself blown from a can-1
lion. Now. as soon as his mausoleum is completed, he plans 1
to stage this event, and he tells his followers:
"When I Ijavc disappeared in a storm of fire and smoke
you must search thoroughly, and you will find my right ear,;
for there is not a more perfect organ in the world and il
cannot perish/"
D'Annunzio and George Hernard Shaw, that other de-'
lightful old publicity man, have a lot in common. Shaw
has a more varied attack, but d'Annunzio may we speak
loosely? puts an aesthetic wallop in his single theme.
The Dai It/ Trojan.

Michael Arlcn has changed his mind about Xew York, i
"The women are not the lovely goddesses who used lo walk
along the avenues seven or eight years ago. They do not
dress as stylishly, and Ihal rapt, superior look which dis
tinguished their faces has given way to gloom." Perhaps
Michael is getting old.
