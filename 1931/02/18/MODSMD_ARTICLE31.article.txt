# Campus Opinion
## FOR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In spile of a growing doubt as to
just what Messrs. Young and Cheo
were intending to say in yesterday's
Campus Opinion, I have a suspi
cion that inasmuch as I have at
least a leg under that blanket classi
fication of pacifists, I should com
ment briefly:
Frankly, I am prejudiced and I
can imagine anyone might well be
who deserted the peaceful pursuits
of life to give personal attention to
the task—admittedly disagreeable
though lofty—of ridding the world
of a race of atrocious monsters who
defiled women and children (of
which there has been no evidence
to substantiate) and in genei'al
"Make the world safe for Demo
cracy." Marvelous, wasn't it? And
so much of lasting good accom
plished—as in the case ol' all mod
ern wars, as we mis-readers of
history would say.
Now I cannot find it in my heart
to object to riding boots, nor the
pleasant pastime of learning to sit
the saddle and post properly. My
quarrel is not with the R.O.T.C. nor
the military—but with a system
which, while it lasts will be a con
stant hindrance to progress. Warjs
to end v/ars some ways always seem
to miscarry. Pardon again a mis
reader of history.
I am committed to oppose the war
system because it has beon proven
uneconomic, inhuman, and totally
incompetent as an instrument for
settling international problems. If
this be sentimentalism, then I am
most guilty.
Mr. Young is an American, Mr.
Cheo, a Chinese. They are room
mates. They aspire to be oll'icers mi
the next war. I am almost tempted
to say that I would be willing to
join the Artillery on the chance of
being present when Mr. Young
meets Mr. Cheo and each says to
the other, "Too bad, old top, but
you know we must not let our
friendship and the sense of kinship
under the skin stand in the way of
doing our duty for God and for
country."

doing our duty for God and for
country."
Tom Vasey, '32.
