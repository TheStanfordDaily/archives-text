# ABOLISH GRADEPOINT AVER..

The Editor, Sir:
It is quite surprising that the
campus discussion of Stanford's de
funct honor system could have gone
as far as it has without resulting in
better suggestions for remedying ihe

! situation. The saying about "Failing
i to see the forest because of the
! trees" is particularly apt here.
Two recent letters have been pub-
I lished which demonstrated micro-
I scopic scrutinization of the "trees"
but left the "forest" unseen. Dr.
Bailey suggests more drastic penal
! ties for cheaters, including publica
tion of names; a reduction of student
enrollment; and a better sele'ction
I of applicants. N. Overton believes
i cheating will be discouraged by ex
i pelling all offenders and telling
everyone that we "MUST OBEY
i THE RULES." Contemplation dem
! onstrates that such measures are
| pitifully inadequate.
"My reason for claiming the inade
i quacy of such methods is that they
| overlook the real motivation lying
behind the cheating done here and
I elsewhere. This motivation is of two
j sorts. One is social pressure and the
i other is a mania for "Grades"
| brought about by an unfortunate
| educational system. The force of
I social pressure needs no explana
| tion.
When a student is faced with
being required to leave his circle of
( friends for having low grades,
; cheating becomes secondary in im-
I portance, honor system or no. The
! modern educational system has de
| veloped to such a point where
"units" and "grades" are all-im-
I portant, regardless of the develop
ment of the individual student, who
I gets an "education" in spite of going
to college, not because of . going.
These social and educational forces
' are of course closely related.
The honor system can never suc
j ceed under such conditions. Abolish
j petty course requirements, grade
| point averages, and the bawl-out,
I and substitute instead a curriculum
| such as the University of Chicago
; has recently adopted. After all, a
' comprehensive examination over a
j year's work yields a higher return
I to the student and is less of an evil
! than a lot of pesky quizzes through
| out the year. The very nature of a
I comprehensive examination avoids
I the possibility of cheating altogether,
j for each examination is an indi
j vidual product and facts per se are
j valueless.
If Stanford has any of the Jordan
tradition left, such a change might
happen here. If it does not, jolting
j penalties and the like will only
, drive cheating into more subtle
J ways.

The Editor, Sir:
It is quite surprising that the
campus discussion of Stanford's de
funct honor system could have gone
as far as it has without resulting in
better suggestions for remedying ihe

! situation. The saying about "Failing
i to see the forest because of the
! trees" is particularly apt here.
Two recent letters have been pub-
I lished which demonstrated micro-
I scopic scrutinization of the "trees"
but left the "forest" unseen. Dr.
Bailey suggests more drastic penal
! ties for cheaters, including publica
tion of names; a reduction of student
enrollment; and a better sele'ction
I of applicants. N. Overton believes
i cheating will be discouraged by ex
i pelling all offenders and telling
everyone that we "MUST OBEY
i THE RULES." Contemplation dem
! onstrates that such measures are
| pitifully inadequate.
"My reason for claiming the inade
i quacy of such methods is that they
| overlook the real motivation lying
behind the cheating done here and
I elsewhere. This motivation is of two
j sorts. One is social pressure and the
i other is a mania for "Grades"
| brought about by an unfortunate
| educational system. The force of
I social pressure needs no explana
| tion.
When a student is faced with
being required to leave his circle of
( friends for having low grades,
; cheating becomes secondary in im-
I portance, honor system or no. The
! modern educational system has de
| veloped to such a point where
"units" and "grades" are all-im-
I portant, regardless of the develop
ment of the individual student, who
I gets an "education" in spite of going
to college, not because of . going.
These social and educational forces
' are of course closely related.
The honor system can never suc
j ceed under such conditions. Abolish
j petty course requirements, grade
| point averages, and the bawl-out,
I and substitute instead a curriculum
| such as the University of Chicago
; has recently adopted. After all, a
' comprehensive examination over a
j year's work yields a higher return
I to the student and is less of an evil
! than a lot of pesky quizzes through
| out the year. The very nature of a
I comprehensive examination avoids
I the possibility of cheating altogether,
j for each examination is an indi
j vidual product and facts per se are
j valueless.
If Stanford has any of the Jordan
tradition left, such a change might
happen here. If it does not, jolting
j penalties and the like will only
, drive cheating into more subtle
J ways.
