# CABBAGES and Things..

Our little pals of the sporting bas
ketball tribe thought they'd do
something really intriguing and dif
ferent, and so, all for their own
amusement, they had a practice "ses
sion yesterday that was like a
grammar school play-day program.
Maybe one of them had gotten an
idea on shipboard athletics, once.
Anyhow, one of the prize events
at which they proved their true
merit was the blindfold attempt at
basket-shooting. Scores weren't very
high; but they never are. If we
could institute a new rule for the
game, saying that all forwards must
shoot blindfolded, there'd be a good
excuse for failure.

Wo can't decide whether it's a
sign of death's angel hovering, or
an Italian garden scene, represented


And here we have a co-ed's
dream, an idea of what some
one on the campus might have
looked like, once. A composite
picture of all of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, as seen by one of the
local chapter members.
