It is claimed at Swarthmore that I
every college game that becomes a j
spectacle deteriorates.
That may be so, but every
college sport that becomes a
spectacle brings in more money,
and the more money that is
raised the greater number of
non-spectacle sports that can
Ke financed at the university.
The brand of "commercialism" and
j other less printable things are
hurled at football, but without foot- j
j ball the average college would have '
j no gymnasium, no swimming pool,
j and no dance pavilion to write about ,
| in its circular.
Laborers are agitating for the j
five-day week. Not to be outdone :
by those who work with their \
j hands, students at the University of j
| Georgia have begun a drive for the I
i elimination of Saturday classes.
Saturday elasscs are .some
filing like Fate—you may dislike
them, you may fight against
them, but sooner or later they
get you.
Dean Mandell of Yale claims that
the extinction of group singing, so i
popular during the last decade, may
; be laid to the abolition of the oid
l time beer gardens.
Now, who is there to claim
that prohibition is not a grand
success?
| The president of the University of
Florida claims that Florida has no
j traditions; he is glad of it, for he
feels that college traditions are a lot
of bunk.
Tin* only difference between
the Florida and other campuses
is that Florida has no traditions
and is satisfied, and other col
leges have none and attempt all
sorts of campaigns to stimulate
the production of traditions.
All these campaigns that start out
with, "Podunk Must Have More
Traditions," forget that traditions
are spontaneous productions of the ■
past and cannot be manufactured
like so many sausages.
