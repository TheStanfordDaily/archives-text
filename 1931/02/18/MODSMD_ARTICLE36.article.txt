i MOROCCO—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
'"Morocco" has been criticized for
a weak story and for long dull
stretches. We found neither. It starts
so well that you are satisfied with
everything. Northern Africa is aptly
j transferred to the screen—the diffi
culties of the love of a jaded vaude
villian and an irrepressible legion
i naire, complicated with an extreme
; ly rich man-of-the-world, provide
j strong interest.
The story proceeds with clever
; handling of the characters. The cn
| chanting, cool Marlene Dietrich
! handles her part with perfect fin
: esse. Gary Cooper and Adolph Men
; jou give excellent performances;

Von Sternberg's direction stands cut
notably; the photography and sound
are well done.
A look at Menjou's Rolls Royce is
worth the price of admission.

VAGABOND DE LUXE. By John
Marsh. The Century Company,
New York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
When Richard Halliburton left
Princeton to play the role of Ro
mantic Youth Seeking Adventure,
his (financially) successful books
pointed a path to fame and fortune
that has kept the printing presses
sweating ever since, pouring out
innumerable narrations by youths

I who have toured the world, forti- !
I fied with nothing but a Kodak and
; a set of pearly-white teeth.
This latest attempt by a member
of the Halliburton School of Litera- i
tare contains the conventional num- j
her of arrests of our bold hero by j
■ wicked foreign police, the conven- |
i tional moonlit nights on tropical J
i beaches, and the conventional large !
i number of illustrations showing The ;
i Author and the Pyramids, The Au
■ thor and the EifTel Tower, et cetera; |
; worth reading if you enjoy modi- j
i ocre thoughts phrased in common
| place style. —R. M.

TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT. By
Charles Scott Erskine Wood, 1931.

(At the Palo Alto Hook Shop.) i
As an up-to-the-minute disciple j
jof the anarchists Eakunin and j
Kropotkin, Erskine Wood in '"Too j
Much Government" takes another j
slam at the corrupt and inefficient j
j system of government existing in j
these United States of America, j
Here the author of "Heavenly Dis- |
; course," imbued with the noble de- ■
; sire to see that justice is done by '
the poor taxpayer, appears in his I
I most eloquently sarcastic form.
Despite Hearst and many another I
1 100 per cent American, the bearded ;
Mr. Wood has grounds for com- '
plaint. Even some of our eminent ■
political scientists, who should j
know if anybody, have raised the j
j question—ls there "Too Much Gov- j
ernment" here? We personally do '
I not know, but Wood thinks so, and j
| rays so as only he can. —W. R.
