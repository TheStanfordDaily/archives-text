WHAT A PROGRAM!
From the moment that hurler Dan
Johnson offers up the first pitch of
the 1931 Indian conference baseball
season against the Broncos down at
Santa Clara this afternoon, until
Captain Gordan's redshirted polo
four rides off the Highway field
Monday after settling their mallet
argument with a crack Arizona
quartet, so many sporting events
will take place in the region of the
Farm that the dyed-in-the-wool,
all-around fan will find himself
physically incapable of attending
even a large percentage of them.
To the horsehide enthusiast
will he offered a delectable dish
in two varsity conference games
and one freshman tilt in that
comparatively short period of
time. After the season's opener
on the Bronco pasture today,
the Cardinal nine will take on
St. Mary's Saturday in a con
test baptizing the new Stanford
hall park. The yearling sluggers
will meet Polytechnic I!igh
School on the same day.
Followers of swimming will get a
treat Friday afternoon in Encina
pool when the Indian mermen face
tin invading team from the Univer
sity of Oregon. Those men from
Oregon practically live in the rain,
and the fact that they are called
the Webfeet is not without signifi
cance. Good paddlers, they should
furnish plenty of excitement for the
local swimmers, though Coach Ernie
Brandsten's men should come out
on top. Austin C'lapp looked mighty
good in setting a new 440-yard free
style coast collegiate record last
week, as did Tuppy Gardner and
Frank Booth in setting new marks
for Ihe 50-yard free-style and the
100-yard backstroke, respectively.
To Captain (Jordan, who has
coached polo on the Farm to f»
place where it is now compar
able to any college riding quar
tet in the country, the comple
tion of arrangements with the
undefeated Arizona riders for
two games here on Saturday and
Monday was a great hope real
ized. Last year the local four
had a tough time getting match
es with peninsula mallet-swing
ers, since most of them did not
relish the thought of being
trounced by a college outfit.
This year, the Indian poloists
are better than ever, with Jack
McDougall holding down the
key position in big league style.
McDougall is the best player
ever to ride for this institution,
and perhaps on a par with the
best any college has seen.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 o'clock
the annual interclass track meet will
begin, promising this season to be
bigger and better than ever. Al
ways a good indication to the In
dian oval prospects, the finish of
this year's meet should find several
new class records hanging on the
scoreboard, if not at least a close
shave for an intercollegiate mark
or two. Every event is packed with
close competition, especially the
dash events, which we wouldn't
miss witnessing for plenty.
Les Hables, who has credit for
running the hundred in 9.8, the
fastest time recorded on the coast
yet this season, will be attempting
to repeat his Friday's performance
of downing Hec Dyer, who has
shaded even numbers a time or two
himself this year. One can never be
sure of what Giberson is going to
pull, and Lombardi and Howell
have no compunction about defying
10 fiat themselves. Ben Eastman,
who can run the quarter-mile in
consistently close to 43 seconds, may
start in the 880. Should he enter
the 440, however, don't be too quick
about awarding him the prize. Les
Hables might not like it.

Fight fans v. ill also have their
si ia re of entertainment over the
coming week-end, since a group
of husky boys from Berkeley
are to be guests of Harry Mo
loney and his sluggers in the
Pavilion Friday night. Add to
this a freshman-varsity cage
contest in the Pavilion this af
ternoon, which promises to he
very interesting; a yearling hoop
tussle against California in the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday
night, and you have what might
be termed a pregnant sport pro
gram. Incidentally, there is a
little matter that the varsity
basketball team has yet to settle
with a Blue and Gold five up
there, too; a casaba series, to be
specific. —Crawford.

Brandsten's men should come out
on top. Austin C'lapp looked mighty
good in setting a new 440-yard free
style coast collegiate record last
week, as did Tuppy Gardner and
Frank Booth in setting new marks
for Ihe 50-yard free-style and the
100-yard backstroke, respectively.
To Captain (Jordan, who has
coached polo on the Farm to f»
place where it is now compar
able to any college riding quar
tet in the country, the comple
tion of arrangements with the
undefeated Arizona riders for
two games here on Saturday and
Monday was a great hope real
ized. Last year the local four
had a tough time getting match
es with peninsula mallet-swing
ers, since most of them did not
relish the thought of being
trounced by a college outfit.
This year, the Indian poloists
are better than ever, with Jack
McDougall holding down the
key position in big league style.
McDougall is the best player
ever to ride for this institution,
and perhaps on a par with the
best any college has seen.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 o'clock
the annual interclass track meet will
begin, promising this season to be
bigger and better than ever. Al
ways a good indication to the In
dian oval prospects, the finish of
this year's meet should find several
new class records hanging on the
scoreboard, if not at least a close
shave for an intercollegiate mark
or two. Every event is packed with
close competition, especially the
dash events, which we wouldn't
miss witnessing for plenty.
Les Hables, who has credit for
running the hundred in 9.8, the
fastest time recorded on the coast
yet this season, will be attempting
to repeat his Friday's performance
of downing Hec Dyer, who has
shaded even numbers a time or two
himself this year. One can never be
sure of what Giberson is going to
pull, and Lombardi and Howell
have no compunction about defying
10 fiat themselves. Ben Eastman,
who can run the quarter-mile in
consistently close to 43 seconds, may
start in the 880. Should he enter
the 440, however, don't be too quick
about awarding him the prize. Les
Hables might not like it.

Fight fans v. ill also have their
si ia re of entertainment over the
coming week-end, since a group
of husky boys from Berkeley
are to be guests of Harry Mo
loney and his sluggers in the
Pavilion Friday night. Add to
this a freshman-varsity cage
contest in the Pavilion this af
ternoon, which promises to he
very interesting; a yearling hoop
tussle against California in the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday
night, and you have what might
be termed a pregnant sport pro
gram. Incidentally, there is a
little matter that the varsity
basketball team has yet to settle
with a Blue and Gold five up
there, too; a casaba series, to be
specific. —Crawford.
WHAT A PROGRAM!
From the moment that hurler Dan

the 1931 Indian conference baseball
season against the Broncos down at
Santa Clara this afternoon, until
Captain Gordan's redshirted polo
four rides off the Highway field
Monday after settling their mallet
argument with a crack Arizona
quartet, so many sporting events
will take place in the region of the

physically incapable of attending
even a large percentage of them.
To the horsehide enthusiast
will he offered a delectable dish
in two varsity conference games

on the Bronco pasture today,

St. Mary's Saturday in a con

shave for an intercollegiate mark
or two. Every event is packed with
close competition, especially the
dash events, which we wouldn't
miss witnessing for plenty.
Les Hables, who has credit for
running the hundred in 9.8, the
fastest time recorded on the coast
yet this season, will be attempting
to repeat his Friday's performance
of downing Hec Dyer, who has
shaded even numbers a time or two
himself this year. One can never be
sure of what Giberson is going to
pull, and Lombardi and Howell
have no compunction about defying
10 fiat themselves. Ben Eastman,
who can run the quarter-mile in
consistently close to 43 seconds, may
start in the 880. Should he enter
the 440, however, don't be too quick
about awarding him the prize. Les
Hables might not like it.

Fight fans v. ill also have their
si ia re of entertainment over the
coming week-end, since a group
of husky boys from Berkeley
are to be guests of Harry Mo
loney and his sluggers in the
Pavilion Friday night. Add to
this a freshman-varsity cage
contest in the Pavilion this af
ternoon, which promises to he
very interesting; a yearling hoop
tussle against California in the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday
night, and you have what might
be termed a pregnant sport pro
gram. Incidentally, there is a
little matter that the varsity
basketball team has yet to settle
with a Blue and Gold five up
there, too; a casaba series, to be
specific. —Crawford.
