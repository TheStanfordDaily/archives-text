# Cards Face Santa Clara In League Game Today
## INDIAN NINE OPENS SEASON WITH TILT ON BRONC'S FIELD Lineup Changes Probable; Hunken May Be Used As First Sacker 
### 
| Several startling developments and
| probable changes occurred in Ihe
! lineup of the Stanford varsity nine
i in yesterday's practice on tho eve
j of the Indians first league game with
l Santa Clara on the lattei*'s home
j field at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon.
! Ike Li verm ye, last year's freshman
j catcher, may start the game today
while Captain Johnny Hunken was
working out around the initial sack
I and may be moved from left field
i to first base.
After starting the season with a
i sore arm, Livermore has gradually
improved until Wolter now consid
ers him one of the leading candidates
for the receiving post. Livermore's
hitting thus far in practice was one
of the chief reasons for the lanky
sophomore's promotion to a place
among the "contenders" with Pihl,
Miller,- and Hardy.
Ilunkcn Scintilates
Although it i:i not likely that Cap
tain Hunken will start the game to
day at first, it is evident that Wolter
considers him as a possible candi
date for the position. In yesterday's
infield practice, Hunken showed to
very good advantage being clever at
taking ground balls and fast in
getting off his pegs. However Spud
Hardy's showing seemed likely to
retain him the guardianship of first.
Coach Walter "the Great" Mails
of the Broncos, who has recently
taken a course in public speaking to
aid him in putting pep in the team,
was quoted as saying that he didn't
know who was going to beat Santa
Clara out ot the Conference cham
pionship, although he wouldn't ac
tually say 'the Mission outfit would
cop the i-ace! Mails stated that
there were several men on the
Bronco tea mwho looked like Major
League material.
Lee Star
Besides Captain Harper, who
roams about the keystone sack,
Santa Clara has Jeri'y Lee a great
prospective first baseman. Accord
ing to local propaganda there is not
much Lee can't do in the way of
fielding and hitting. However more
actual facts will replace the sus
pected "hooey" after todays game
and the true merit of the Broncos
can be judged.
Harry Wolter announced that some
time during this week the members
of the baseball coaching staff of
Keio University, Japan, who are in
this country to get pointers on mod
ern baseball tactics, will visit the
Farm in order to study the features
of Stanford's new diamond. Up till
now the Japanese have been visit
ing coast league training camps un- j
der the sponsorship of the N.Y.K. i
steamship line.

for the receiving post. Livermore's
hitting thus far in practice was one
of the chief reasons for the lanky
sophomore's promotion to a place
among the "contenders" with Pihl,
Miller,- and Hardy.
Ilunkcn Scintilates
Although it i:i not likely that Cap
tain Hunken will start the game to
day at first, it is evident that Wolter
considers him as a possible candi
date for the position. In yesterday's
infield practice, Hunken showed to
very good advantage being clever at
taking ground balls and fast in
getting off his pegs. However Spud
Hardy's showing seemed likely to
retain him the guardianship of first.
Coach Walter "the Great" Mails
of the Broncos, who has recently
taken a course in public speaking to
aid him in putting pep in the team,
was quoted as saying that he didn't
know who was going to beat Santa
Clara out ot the Conference cham
pionship, although he wouldn't ac
tually say 'the Mission outfit would
cop the i-ace! Mails stated that
there were several men on the
Bronco tea mwho looked like Major
League material.
Lee Star
Besides Captain Harper, who
roams about the keystone sack,
Santa Clara has Jeri'y Lee a great
prospective first baseman. Accord
ing to local propaganda there is not
much Lee can't do in the way of
fielding and hitting. However more
actual facts will replace the sus
pected "hooey" after todays game
and the true merit of the Broncos
can be judged.
Harry Wolter announced that some
time during this week the members
of the baseball coaching staff of
Keio University, Japan, who are in
this country to get pointers on mod
ern baseball tactics, will visit the
Farm in order to study the features
of Stanford's new diamond. Up till
now the Japanese have been visit
ing coast league training camps un- j
der the sponsorship of the N.Y.K. i
steamship line.
Lineups for the game are as fol- •
lows: Stanford, Johnson, p; catcher
not announced; Hardy, lb; Philippi, |
2b; Johnson, 3b: Delmas, ss; Hunken, !
If; Campbell, cf; Eddie, rf.
For Santa Clara: Thomas, p;
Morey, c; Lee, lb; Harper, 2b; Stu- i
art, 3b; Murray, ss; Rowland, If;
Long, cf; Farrell, rf.
| Several startling developments and
| probable changes occurred in Ihe
! lineup of the Stanford varsity nine
i in yesterday's practice on tho eve
j of the Indians first league game with
l Santa Clara on the lattei*'s home
j field at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon.
! Ike Li verm ye, last year's freshman
j catcher, may start the game today
while Captain Johnny Hunken was
working out around the initial sack
I and may be moved from left field
i to first base.
After starting the season with a
i sore arm, Livermore has gradually
improved until Wolter now consid
ers him one of the leading candidates
for the receiving post. Livermore's
