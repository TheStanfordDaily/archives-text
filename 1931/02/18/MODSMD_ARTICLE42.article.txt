# VARSITY TRACKMEN IN LIGHT WORKOUTS FOR ANNUAL INTERCLASS MEET FRIDAY
## 
### 
Devoting tho entire practice ses
j sions of the last two days to try
| outs for the Irish Marathon, a fea
' lure of the interclass track and field
meet, Coach "Dink" Templeton has
allowed his varsity athletes to take
light workouts in preparation for
the competition in the Stadium Fri
day afternoon.
I Meanwhile the field men, jumpers,
: and hurdlers have been taking it
i comparatively easy, and should be
|in excellent condition when they
clash for the honor of "dear old '31,"
of whatnot, next Friday.
No exceptional times have been
recorded in the tryout heats for ihe
Irish Marathon, since all that is
; needed for qualification is a one-lap
| time of 60 seconds. The better run
| ners on the squad have been loafiing
j around the oval to finish somewhere
|in the middle fifties. A different
i story may be expected Friday, how
ever, for this annual track event
I will bring together not only the
regular quarter-milers, but a good
I share of the sprinters, hurdlers,
1 broad-jumpers, and distance men.
Twenty-four runners from each
i class compete in the Marathon, each

man making a complete lap of the
track. Last year some very good
times were recorded, Ben Eastman,
'33, turning in the fastest lap of
48.6 seconds.
It is not yet certain whether Ihe
star sophomore quarter-miler will
be entered in the 440 or the half
mile event Friday, but he will reign
favorite to cop first place in either
run. Eastman's 48.2 time, made when
he was a freshman, is only a single
second short of the present world
record.
So far this season, Eastman holds
the record for the fastest time in
the 880-yard run. He will have no
cinch in winning either of his
events, however, with men like Ike
Hables, Maynor Shove, Jim Howell,
Tom Neikirk, Frank Fullenwider,
and Bob Atkinson in the running.
The pole vault should turn out to
be an interesting contest if Burt
DeGroot, Ned Johns, and Bernard
Deacon are all competing. The win
ner may have to go 13 feet to win
first-place points in this event.

events, however, with men like Ike
Hables, Maynor Shove, Jim Howell,
Tom Neikirk, Frank Fullenwider,
and Bob Atkinson in the running.
The pole vault should turn out to
be an interesting contest if Burt
DeGroot, Ned Johns, and Bernard
Deacon are all competing. The win

first-place points in this event.
Devoting tho entire practice ses
j sions of the last two days to try
| outs for the Irish Marathon, a fea
' lure of the interclass track and field
meet, Coach "Dink" Templeton has
allowed his varsity athletes to take
light workouts in preparation for
the competition in the Stadium Fri
day afternoon.
I Meanwhile the field men, jumpers,
: and hurdlers have been taking it
i comparatively easy, and should be
|in excellent condition when they
clash for the honor of "dear old '31,"
of whatnot, next Friday.
No exceptional times have been
recorded in the tryout heats for ihe
Irish Marathon, since all that is
; needed for qualification is a one-lap
| time of 60 seconds. The better run
| ners on the squad have been loafiing
j around the oval to finish somewhere
|in the middle fifties. A different
i story may be expected Friday, how
ever, for this annual track event
I will bring together not only the
regular quarter-milers, but a good
I share of the sprinters, hurdlers,
1 broad-jumpers, and distance men.
Twenty-four runners from each
i class compete in the Marathon, each

man making a complete lap of the
track. Last year some very good
times were recorded, Ben Eastman,
'33, turning in the fastest lap of
48.6 seconds.
It is not yet certain whether Ihe
star sophomore quarter-miler will
be entered in the 440 or the half
mile event Friday, but he will reign
favorite to cop first place in either
run. Eastman's 48.2 time, made when
he was a freshman, is only a single
second short of the present world
record.
So far this season, Eastman holds
the record for the fastest time in
the 880-yard run. He will have no
cinch in winning either of his
events, however, with men like Ike
Hables, Maynor Shove, Jim Howell,
Tom Neikirk, Frank Fullenwider,
and Bob Atkinson in the running.
The pole vault should turn out to
be an interesting contest if Burt
DeGroot, Ned Johns, and Bernard
Deacon are all competing. The win
ner may have to go 13 feet to win
first-place points in this event.
