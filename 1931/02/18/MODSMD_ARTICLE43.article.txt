# FROSH BALL GAME CALLED OFF WITH PALY HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
Palo Alto High as a possibility for !
a midweek game for the Indian
yearling squad is definitely out of
the way, and prospects of a clash j
with some other local team seemed
slight last night.
Coach Murray Cuddeback's men
at present are confining their activi- '
ties to preparation for Saturday's j
struggle with Polytechnic High from
San Francisco.
Stan Anderson, ace of the babe
hurlers, has not gone on the mound j
since the thirteen-inning epic with
Mission High, and he will probably ,
do the flinging for the freshmen j
Saturday.
Joe Robinson has appeared at j
short in this week's practice ses- !
sions, after having been moved over \
from third. The change is apparent- j
ly strengthening the lineup, with |
Bacon filling in acceptably at third
base for Robinson.
