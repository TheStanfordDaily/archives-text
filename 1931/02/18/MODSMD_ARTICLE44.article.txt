# INDIAN BOXERS TO MEET FAST BEAR MITTMEN
## Glover, Johnson, and Miller Sure of Competing On Local Squad 
### 
With the big event of the boxing
season, the varsity bouts with the
I California Bears, just two days
i away, Coach Harry Maloney's squad
of leather-pushers is working hard
to avenge the defeat suffered at the
: Berkeley men's hands in their last
intercollegiate clash, a year ago.
j From present indications, the In
| dian team should grab the honors
from their traditional Golden Bear
I rivals this season. Although little
lis known on the Farm of the
; strength of the Berkeley squad, Ma
j loney's 1931 Stanford aggregation
! seems to be the strongest in several
years,
In the bantamweight class Ma
loney has two. fine little fighters in
Yuji Imai and Mark Kai-Kee. Imai
is the University titleholder in his
class and has a victory over Nevada
; to his credit this season. Kai-Kee
i came through with a three-round
; decision at Davis last Friday night.
Glover Is Star
Fred Glover is the whole story in
! the leather division, but he is far
; superior to the average college
: boxer. He holds the Stanford
j featherweight title, and has won
both his varsity matches this year,
one by the K.O. method.
Vance Rogers is almost certain to
be chosen for Stanford's entry in
j the lightweight class. He won the
! decision in the Wolf Pack fray, but
i was outpointed in an extra-round
j bout at Davis.
Maloney has unusual strength in
j the welter class, with Dick Miller
j and Jim Kelley both on the squad,
j Captain Fred Johnson, middle
' weight, seems capable of taking all
j comers in his department.
Hugh Keenan and Gordon Gilbert
; are both good light-heavies. Gilbert
I is the school champion, although he
was outpointed in his bout with
Nevada. Keenan looked better than
ever before in taking the Aggie
light-heavy last Friday.
The big boy class is well taken
care of with "Red" Targhetta, Tom
Driscoll, and Bill Harding all on
deck. Any of these men makes a
tough opponent for the average
J heavyweight amateur.
Doubling previous budgets, Wyo
ming will spend $5,180,000 for high
way construction and improvement
during 1931.

With the big event of the boxing
season, the varsity bouts with the
I California Bears, just two days
i away, Coach Harry Maloney's squad
of leather-pushers is working hard
to avenge the defeat suffered at the
: Berkeley men's hands in their last
intercollegiate clash, a year ago.
j From present indications, the In
| dian team should grab the honors
from their traditional Golden Bear
I rivals this season. Although little
lis known on the Farm of the
; strength of the Berkeley squad, Ma
j loney's 1931 Stanford aggregation
! seems to be the strongest in several
years,
In the bantamweight class Ma
loney has two. fine little fighters in
Yuji Imai and Mark Kai-Kee. Imai
is the University titleholder in his
class and has a victory over Nevada
; to his credit this season. Kai-Kee
i came through with a three-round
; decision at Davis last Friday night.
Glover Is Star
Fred Glover is the whole story in
! the leather division, but he is far
; superior to the average college
: boxer. He holds the Stanford
j featherweight title, and has won
both his varsity matches this year,
one by the K.O. method.
Vance Rogers is almost certain to
be chosen for Stanford's entry in
j the lightweight class. He won the
! decision in the Wolf Pack fray, but
i was outpointed in an extra-round
j bout at Davis.
Maloney has unusual strength in
j the welter class, with Dick Miller
j and Jim Kelley both on the squad,
j Captain Fred Johnson, middle
' weight, seems capable of taking all
j comers in his department.
Hugh Keenan and Gordon Gilbert
; are both good light-heavies. Gilbert
I is the school champion, although he
was outpointed in his bout with
Nevada. Keenan looked better than
ever before in taking the Aggie
light-heavy last Friday.
The big boy class is well taken
care of with "Red" Targhetta, Tom
Driscoll, and Bill Harding all on
deck. Any of these men makes a
tough opponent for the average
J heavyweight amateur.

ming will spend $5,180,000 for high
