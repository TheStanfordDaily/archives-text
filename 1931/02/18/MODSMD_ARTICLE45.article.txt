Austin Clapp, nationally known
member of the 1928 Olympic Games
relay team, seems certain of taking
the 440-yard free-style event in
better than the present record of
5:42.
Clapp May Win
Although time for the 220-yard
race may not be shattered, Clapp
should also cop a first in this event.
Ward Woods will compete for the
Indians in the 220-yard sprint, while
Paul de Silva is entered in the 410-
yard race.
Whitey Burns, Stanford Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate titleholder in
the 200-yard breast-stroke, faces the
possibility of defeat, as Fletcher and
Saunders of Oregon have consist
ently been bettering his time of 2:44
minutes in practice meets.
The third record-smashing race
should be won by Stanford, as
Frank Booth, back-stroke star, is
expected to finish first in the 150-
yard event.
Should Take Relay
The 400-yard relay should also go
to the Indians, as the team com
posed of Jack Trotter, Jack McKol
vey, Ward Woods, and Barret Brown*
should be able to take the Northern
ers into camp with a time of about
3:52 minutes.
But because of Stanford's appar
ent weakness in the breast-stroke,
the visitors may cop the medley re
lay.
Pete Desjardins, best diver in 'he
world, and Ed Throndson, national
intercollegiate champion, will, as
one of the features of the meet, pre
sent a diving exhibition. The plunges
will be from the 30-foot tower as
well as from the standard 10-foot
board. In addition, the two mermen
will give a comedy diving act.
