# COUGHLIN-PLYMIRE TO DEFEND PLACE IN DOUBLES LADDER
## 
### 
Joe Coughlin and Harry Plymire
will start off the tennis doubles lad
der play this afternoon at 2:30 on
the varsity courts by defending
their position as second team against
Phil Niederauer and Wilbur Cox,
rated number three. All four play
ers hold down high ranking posi
tions singly, and some flashy dou
bles work may be expected this
afternoon.
The only team considered over
the heads of the Coughlin-Plymire
combination is made up of Keith
Gledhill and Ted Easton, a pair that
will not easily be dislodged from its
throne.
Chuck Weesner and Bob Forbes
are rated number four, Trow Steph
ens and Hubert Butler number five,
and Kelsey Petterson and John Gor
don number six. Further down are
Pobinson and Forney, Bergstrom
and Eichelberger, Haehl and Baker,
and Blethen and Edwards.
