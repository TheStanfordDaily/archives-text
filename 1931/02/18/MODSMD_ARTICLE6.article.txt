### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 17. (JP)—'The
great city of Madrid, lying under
the frowning guns of artillery and
with soldiers in barracks for any
emergency, tonight quivered with
expectancy as King Alfonso and
supporters of his regime struggled
desperately to find some solution of
the vital political crisis now facing
the Spanish monarchy.
As the military took every pre
caution to prevent possible trouble,
crowds gathered in the central part
of the city. Some shouted for the
King; others against him.
Police charged the mob, dispersed
and arrested some, but there were
no serious disorders. Everyone was
waiting.
Three Possibilities
Three possibilities are offered the
government:
(1) The King may establish a
government of the right wing mon
archists.
(2) He may establish a govern
ment by a combination of right
wing monarchists and liberals.
(3) Should it become necessary
he may establish a military dicta
torship.
Madrid tonight is fairly quiet al
though *there have been some dis
turbances in the central part of the
city where crowds gathered, some
for the monarchy and some against
it.
