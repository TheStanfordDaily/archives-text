# FIVE TENNIS TEAMS ADVANCE IN SERIES
## 
### 
Only five teams in the intra-mural
tennis tournament have as yet ad
vanced to the second round, two of
these having gained their positions
through defaults.
Sigma Chi yesterday won by the
default route from Los Arcos, and
Sequoia II defaulted to Sigma Nu,
bringing these two teams up with
Delta Chi, Delta Upsilon, and Delta
Tau Delta.
Coach Elwyn Bugge urges all en
trants to play their contests as soon
as possible.
