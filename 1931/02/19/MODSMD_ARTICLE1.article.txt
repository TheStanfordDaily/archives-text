### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18. (£>).—
Thrusting aside a presidental protest,
the Senate today swept the veterans
loan measure through its Finance
Committee and decided to vote to
morrow in an effort to speed the
legislation to the White House.
The Finance Committee approved
the House bill authorizing loans to
veterans up 1o half the face value
uf their compensation certificates by
a vote of 13 to 3 within an hour
after receiving a letter from the
President vigorously objecting to the
legislation.
Vote Today
Agreement was quickly entered
into a moment later on the Senate
floor to take up the bill tomorrow
and its passage by tomorrow night
without change was predicted by
Senator Harrison, Democrat, Missis
sippi, in getting the agreement for
consideration.
Mr. Hoover's letter to Chairman
Smooth of the Senate Finance Com
mittee asserting the measure will
"not only nullify the benefits to the
veterans but inflict injury to the
country as a whole" was accepted
at Capitol Hill as full warning of a
veto.
Seek Veto Hacking
But administration leaders were
still hunting tonight for the neces
sary one-third votes to sustain the
veto and they admitted this number
was not in sight in the Senate.
Senator Watson, of Indiana, the
Republican leader, joined five other
Republicans on the Finance Commit
tee in supporting the House bill
after a substitute and all amend
ments had been rejected.
The administration representatives
appealed for a compromise which
would restrict the loans to those
veterans actually in distress but the
Finance Committee rejected this pro
posal. Veterans Administrator Hines
estimated the cost of the bill to the
government at approximately $1,-
000,000,000.
