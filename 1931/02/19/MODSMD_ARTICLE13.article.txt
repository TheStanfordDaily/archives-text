# TRICK LIGHTS ON PING-PONG GAME STOP PSYCH FUN

### 
Mind over matter in the
building plans has brought a
feud to students of the psy
chology and physics depart
ments.
The psychologists recently set
up a ping-pong table to liven
the hours of patient attendance
on unwilling white rats. Physics
majors in their laboratory un
der the psychology rooms,
soberly concentrating on elec
tron jumps, were suddenly dis
tracted by the rhythmic pop
ping of a ping-pong ball.
But by connecting an elec
tric relay and a stop-watch to
the light wire, the physicists
made the lights snap off and on
automatically in the rooms
above.
Now whenever the psycholo
gists feel the need of relaxa
tion, their play is short-lived.
For at the first ping the phy
sicists arc at it, and the pong
is treated to total darkness.
