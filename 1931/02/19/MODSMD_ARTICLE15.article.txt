# STANFORD DEBATES COLLEGE OF PACIFIC ON TRADE QUESTION
## 
### 
Stanford debated the free trade
question for the third time within
a week last night against the Col
lege of the Pacific, the non-decision
argument taking place on the Stock
ton campus. The negative of the
subject, "Resolved, that the nations
should adopt a policy of free ti'ade,"
was supported by Raymond Hanson,
John Hunecke, and James Vizzard
of Stanford.

All three Cardinal debaters have
had previous experience, Hanson on
the freshman team last year, Hun
ecke on the varsity squad against
San Jose State, and Vizzard on the
varsity against San Francisco Uni
versity. The Stanford orators were
entertained at dinner before the
debate by the College of the Pacific
coach.
