# NEW ROYALIST CABINET TAKES SEAT IN SPAIN
## Former Premier Included In Ministry Assembled By King Alfonso 
### 
MADRID, Feb. 18 (A 3 ).â€”Spain to
| night had a new government, peace
fully formed, and was looking for
ward to a period of calm after the
political turmoil of the last five
| days.
Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar,
! staunch royalist and political neutral,
heads the ministry formed today by
King Alfonso in a successful effort
i to head off another military dictator
j ship like that of Miguel Primo de
! Rivera.
Replace Old Cabinet
The cabinet which replaces that
lof Ramasco Berenguer which re
| signed last Saturday because of
widespread opposition to Premier
| Berenguer's plank for parliamentary
l elections in March, includes Beren
guer himself and the Count of Ro
manones and the Marquis of Alhu
cemas, the men most responsible for
! his overthrow.
Premier Aznar was expected first
!of all to consider the release of
1 prisoners arrested after the revolts
of last December, who now are
crowding the jails. Indications were
[ that even if amnesty were not
| granted he planned a policy of in
dulgence.
More serious are the political
I problems immediately facing him.
Berenguer was forced from office
because he wished immediate elec-
I lions for the cortcs whereas his op
ponents asked for a constitutional
convention that would decide, while
I the king was on "a holiday" the fu
ture political status of the country
and whether it would become a re
; public or remain a monarchy.
