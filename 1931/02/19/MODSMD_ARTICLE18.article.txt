LONDON, Feb. 18. (/P)â€”ln all his
years as a rowing coach in the
United States, Guy Nickalls, famous
Oxford oarsman, declared in a let
ter printed today, drinking athletes
showed their superiority every time
over teetotalers.
The letter was his contribution to
the controversy which began when

of Commons that England lost on
the cricket field because her players
drank.
"In my own experience as an
oarsman ovpr 28 years," Mr. Nick
alls wrote, "I was never beaten by
a teetotaler. I represented my coun
try in my forty-second year and I
drank all the alcohol, wine, and
beer I could buy, beg, or borrow."
