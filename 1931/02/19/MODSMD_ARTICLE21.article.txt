# Change In 2:30 Lockout Rules Appears Likely
## System Will Continue On Trial This Year 
### 
As a result of a survey made of
conditions under the existing 2:30
lockout rules, Women's Conference
members declared, in a meeting yes
terday, that if the plan is not more
successful during the remainder of
the year than it has been thus far,
the system will be crucially amended.
Because violations of the system
have had a mitigating effect upon
the plan, Conference members con
cluded that some alteration or per
haps a substitute system will prove
more profitable.
The 2:30 system went into effect
at the beginning of this year with
the understanding that it should be
on trial for a year. If it proves suc
cessful, which looks doubtful today,
the rule will remain intact. The
rule was bitterly opposed for many
years before it finally passed last
June.
Further discussion in yesterday's
meeting resulted in the culmination
of plans for the dedication of the
Women's gymnasium.
