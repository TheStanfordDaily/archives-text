# DANCE DRAMA DATE SET FOR MARCH 5; ANNOUNCE PROGRAM
## 
### 
The Dance Drama staged annually
by the women's advanced dancing
class will be presented this year on
Thursday, March 5, at 7:30 o'clock
in the Assembly Hall, instead of on
March 10, as was originally an
nounced. The first date was dis
carded because of its proximity to
finals.
Katherine Musante, dance chair
man, has announced a prospective
program, which will feature an in
terpretation of Victor Hugo's "The
Juggler of Notre Dame." Several
pantomimes, including A. A. Milne's
"The King's Breakfast" will be of
fered in addition to a number of
solos.
A striking novelty, "Evolution,"
will be presented in the modern style
in contrast to the more dreamy
Chopin "Preludes." "Bad Dreams"
and "The Mosquito" are two more
of the interesting numbers on the
program.
