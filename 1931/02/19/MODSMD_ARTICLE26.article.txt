# Cathcart States Write-In Ballots Invalid In Revote
## Altered Ballots Void Under Constitution and By-Laws Rules Law Professor; Loomis, Werder, Schuck Elected to New Senior Positions 
### 
all write-in votes in a revote election arc invalid was the decision
rendered by' Professor A. INI. Cathcart, Acting Dean of the Law School,
yesterday afternoon, when the question of the legality of "write-in"
votes was referred to him by the Executive Committee.
On account of Cathcart's decision, the 41 votes polled by Burncll Gould
for the position of senior class president were thrown out as invalid,
while the same fate was shaded by "write-in" votes for other class offices.
After the void ballots had been discounted, Vard Loomis proved to
have a majority of the votes necessary to make him senior class president.

®Bi!l Werder was elected vicc-presi
] dent and Lillian Scliuck received
| the secretaryship.
| The sophomore vice-presidency
| went to Harold Edelen and the posi- j
i tion of secretary was won by Janet
| Lockey. A third revote will be
! necessary to determine whether
William McCormiek or Bill Corbus
! will act as sophomore class presi
j dent. A date for the third revote |
I will be set at the next meeting of
i the Ex Committee, according to'
J Stewart Stadler, chairman of the
i election board.
Cathcart's Decision
In reading his decision Professor
j Cathcart commented as follows:
". . . . The official printed ballots
! for this election contained the names
• of the two candidates receiving the
j highest number of votes in the first
I election. Upon a number of the bal
! lots cast in the second election the
j two printed names were erased and
the name of a third member of the
class was inserted in writing or by
a printed slip. If the ballots thus |
j cast for the third member are
j counted then nobody received a ma
| jority at the second election. If they
| are disregarded one of the candi-
I dates was elected.
"The first question is: should the
j ballots for the third candidate be
j counted? It seems obvious that they
j should be thrown out as invalid,
j The clear intent of section 5 of the
| constitution is to limit the voting
jin the second election to the two
{ candidates receiving the highest
j number of votes in the first election, j
Next Question
"The next question is: should
! these invalid votes be simply dis- '
I regarded and the ballots for the
j two regular candidates counted as
i though they had been the only bal- |
! lots cast or should the whole elec
j tion be declared void? It is clear
i that the first alternative must be
I taken. A number of voters have
! made a mistake; but. if elections
| were invalidated every time some
voters make mistakes we should j
have very few valid elections.
"A further question has been pre
sented. What is the effect of the
written-in or printed-slip votes
upon election of candidates for
other officers voted for upon the
same ballot.
By-Law Ruling

The answer to this question
seems to be clear upon reference to
| Article VI, Section 2 of the By-
Laws, where these words are used:
" 'Any mark or marks on any
part or parts of (his ballot, except
the intended X makes the whole
ballot void.'
''The context shows that by the
'whole ballot' is meant the vote for
I all candidates upon the one sheet
of paper.
"The word void needs no cx
! planation."
