# CLASS RUNNERS CONTEND TODAY ON SOFT OVAL
## Interclass Meet And Irish Marathon Scheduled To Start At 3: 15 DASH PROSPECTS GOOD Class Of 1931 Is Favorite For First Place 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Campus devotees of the track and
field sports, field and bleacher ath
letics alike, groaned last night in
harmony with the sometimes musi
cal sound of falling rain. For with
the downpour of the past few hours,
hopes for fast, high, and long marks
in this afternoon's annual interclass
meet and Irish Marathon fell simul
taneously.
In spite of the well-known havoc
which prolonged rainfall can play
with even the best of ovals, fans
who have watched Coach "Dink"
Templeton's varsity working out
day after day this season will still
be looking for good, perhaps excep
tional, winning marks when the
first event of the meet gets under
way at 3:15 o'clock in the Stadium.
Hables Makes Record
Les Hables flew down a soft, track
in a drizzling rain to take the cen
tury last Friday in the best time
recorded on the Pacific Coast this
year, 9.8 seconds. With Hables run
ning today against the field of Hec
Dyer, Frank Lombardi, Jimmie
Willson, and Ralph Giberson, this
fast mark may well be equalled.
The Class of 1931 seems to be the
logical favorite for first, place in the
class competition, with a galaxy of
such stars as Captain Podge Smith,
Dyer, Hables, Maynor Shove, Jim
Howell, Bob Brown, Allan Storms,
A1 Nisbet, John Parker, Art Zuger,
Burt DcGroot, and Bill Werder
competing.
1933 Looks Strong
The sophomores and juniors
should put on an intercstir;j n cc for
second-place points, with the Class
of 1933 having a slight edge. Last
year the '33 team finished third,
beating the present juniors by a
safe margin.
The quarter- and half-mile runs
should turn into thrilling races be
fore the finish tape is broken. Ben
Eastman, '33, looks like the winner
in either of these events, but Ike
Hables, '32, Shove, '31, Frank Ful
lenwider, '33, and Walt Cooper, '32,
will furnish plenty of competition.
Brown vs. Storms
Brown, '31, ought to beat out his
classmate, Storms, in the mile, if
recent, performances are any indica
tion, and Manuel Azevedo, '34,
should grab a point or more. Paul
Aebcrsold, '32, is almost certain to
take the two-mile from Parker, '31.
Podge Smith and A1 Nisbet, sen
iors, will probably divide first and
second points in the barrier events,
with Herbert, '33, and Brugmun,
'32, close at their heels.
Blackmail Is Favorite
Don Blackman, '33, has the best
mark to his credit of the group of
high-jumpers on the present squad.
Wally Butler, '32, and Bill Werder,
'31, ought to sit further out in the
sawdust than their rivals in the
broad jump. Pole vault, honors
should be claimed by DeGroot, '31,
or Ned Johns, '32.
In the field events, most of the
competition seems to be between
sophomores and juniors. Nellie Gray,
'33, 'has put the shot almost two feet
further than the probable second
place winner, Here Labordc, '33.
Bob Jones, '32, has a stranglehold
on the discus situation, and two
seniors, Zuger and A1 Ray, should
plant the javelin in the Stadium
turf for winning points.
