# WHERE'S THE RESCUE SQUAD?

### 
Once again the sieve-like construction of [lie A.S.*>.('.
constitution has been forcibly bronchi lionio to the students i
through the mix-up precipitated bv "write-in" ballots at
Tuesday's rovoto.
The constitution provides that, to be elected, candidates
for an olliee must have a majority of the votes cast. No I
provision for "w rite-ins'" is made, either in the constitution |
or on the ballot.
Consequently, the Elections Hoard found itself at a loss
when (\\<> candidates not on the ballot had their names j
written in on several. Each "write-in" candidate, although
running last in the totals, had polled enough votes to keep
either of the other candidates for the post from getting the:
majority that the constitution requires for election.
The Elections Hoard was thereby faced with the problem
of the legality of the write-in votes, something the Elections!
Hoard gracefully declined to decide. So the mattoi was!
given to the law school faculty yesterday for a ruling.
That was a lit illustration of how the present constitution
works. II is riddled with other inconsistencies. For ex
ample, under Article 1). Section one learns that "nomina-i
lions for each election sluill be opcu on the Wednesday pre
ceding tlx" election, and be closed on the evening of the fol- !
lowing day."
All of which is very clear, until one turns to the bylaws,
where it is disclosed that "all nominations shall be open at
<X a.m. 011 Monday of the week preceding the election and
shall be closed at (i p.m. on Thursday "
II might be difficult to believe that the A.S.S.t '. constitu
tion was revised lasl year. Apparently the boys who did
the job forgot all about the by-laws, or didn't think they j
mattered. Tuesday's fiasco should be all the proof neces- j
sarv to show that a careful and systematic revision is
needed immediately.
