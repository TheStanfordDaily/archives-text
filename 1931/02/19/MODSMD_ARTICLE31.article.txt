# LEGISLATIVE MEDDLING UNNECESSARY
## 
### 
The legislative irifling of which Congress has boon so
often accused seems lo be a characteristic not alone of na
tional but likewise of stiite government. The Michigan
legislature is the latest bodv lo join the ranks of the (ri
ders.
Five fraternities at the I'niversitv of Michigan were:
raided by prohibition ollieers last week, liquor was seized,|
and the houses pad-locked. Now the Michigan legislature,,
in order to ameliorate what it declares is a demoralizing
situation, plans to meddle in the matter. A resolution has
been introduced into the legislature asking that a commit-!
lee to investigate liquor conditions on the t'niversily of
Michigan campus be appointed.
Slated purpose of the proposed committee is lo remedy
:i situation that lends "lo undermine respect for the univer
sity, the slate, the faculty, and the student body."
â€¢ All Ibis is quite true, no doubt. Fifty-one quarts of j
liquor is a pretty fair average for any five fraternity houses.
And, it is likely, publicity attendant on Ibis "find" has not
tended to enhance the reputation of "the university, the
stale, the faculty, and the student body." J
Hut whether or not the introduction of ;t legislative com
mittee into the college liquor situation will have any,bene
ficent results is very doubtful. If the Michigan committee is '
anything like the Senate group which "sicccd" detectives
onto Mrs. Hulli Ilanna McCorinick's trail last year, the uni
versity is apl to be favored with more distasteful publicity
than one institution could ever long for.
The Daily Illiiii believes "education's integrity has taken
what has seemed lo be another fall, but the bump was suf
fered most gracefully, and there is an indication that it
may gel up before the count."
A slate legislature has a very intimate relation lo a state
maintained school, of course, in that it is the source of the I
institution's revenues. Hut the legislature's interest should
not extend beyond the control of the university's finances.'
In most states ;i board of regents has been created to man- 1
age Hie university's affairs. I'nder board the univer
sity president functions ;is executive head of the institution.
Michigan's legislature might set an unusual and valuable >
precedent by not interfering in the present situation and
by eon fining itself lo matters which are more immediately I
its concern.
