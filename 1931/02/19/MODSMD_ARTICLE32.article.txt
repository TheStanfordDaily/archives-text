## A 						PROTEST? 
### 
: The Editor, Sir:
In bowing to Mr. Cathcart's legal
authority, attention might humbly
be directed to the fact that elections
are supposed to represent the will
i oi" members of the electorate. That
a certain number (41) cast their
j votes believing this, and a consider
ably larger number of voters were
prevented from doing so by (1) lack
\ of any spaco at all for "write-ins"
, on the ballot, and (2) instructions
against such action by eloction of
j ficials seems not to have been taken
into consideration. The much-"im
! proved" A.S.S.U. constitution fails
j to make any provision for "write

ins," nor does it state in any way
that they are invalid.
Misguided students who voted for
the undersigned, however, have the
satisfaction of knowing that Mr.
Catheart's decision will doubtless
set a precedent. Any sort of a po
litical coup will now be tolerated
in the primaries with the reassur
ing knowledge that nothing can be
done about it.
What Mr. Cathcart calls a ".mis
take" will, of course, not occur
again.
Comic opera plots for the junior
show are due Friday.
