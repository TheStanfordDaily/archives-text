# ALL MILITARISM DESTRUCTIVE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In reply to an editorial of Friday,
February 13, on militarism at Stan
ford, I would like to call attention
to the fact that the writer of the
article evidently completely missed
the thought behind the objections
to the R.O.T.C.
The opposition to military train
ing at Stanford, or any other col
lege, is based upon two distinct
reasons:
(1) It is a part of what is called
the war system, a system which is
generally admitted to have been one
of the chief causes of the Great
War, and is obviously a menace to
peace in the world today. A race in
armaments and a thorough develop
ment of militarism, if not blocked,
will most surely bring about war —a
war, which, it is believed by many
who are in a position to know, will
destroy our present civilization. We
are not concerned with the import
ance of the role played by the
Stanford military department in the
war system; it is enough that it
does play a part.
(2) The R.O.T.C. encourages a
hopeless attitude toward war. It is
true that a military barracks on our
campus is not likely to produce
cold-blooded militarists; it is also
true, however, that constant contact
with military preparedness during a

four-year term in college leaves its
militaristic scar. The psychological
effect of growing up in a military
environment is too often underes
timated. War is more easily taken
for granted by a generation which
has been taught the necessity for
preparedness and the inevitability
of war. Should the development of
such a generation be encouraged in
the University?
Our system preparedness, par
ticularly as exemplified in the
R.0.T.C., has led other nations to
fear our intention and to build up
their own defense. This is specifi
cally illustrated by the reaction of
China.
We should like also to reply to
the Campus Opinion appearing in
the Daily for Monday, Feb. 16, writ
ten by our esteemed friends, Mr.
Young and Mr. Cheo, but in the
outburst of emotion we find noth
ing susceptible of reply, except for
a simple denial of the implication
in regard to the characters of paci
fists—the truth of which denial may
be easily substantiated by a glance
at the lives of such men as David
Starr Jordan, Eugene Debs, Ernest
Meyers, Norman Thoman, Kirby
Page, and Albert Einstein.

The Editor, Sir:
In reply to an editorial of Friday,
February 13, on militarism at Stan
ford, I would like to call attention
to the fact that the writer of the
article evidently completely missed
the thought behind the objections
to the R.O.T.C.
The opposition to military train
ing at Stanford, or any other col
lege, is based upon two distinct
reasons:
(1) It is a part of what is called
the war system, a system which is
generally admitted to have been one
of the chief causes of the Great
War, and is obviously a menace to
peace in the world today. A race in
armaments and a thorough develop
ment of militarism, if not blocked,
will most surely bring about war —a
war, which, it is believed by many
who are in a position to know, will
destroy our present civilization. We
are not concerned with the import
ance of the role played by the
Stanford military department in the
war system; it is enough that it
does play a part.
(2) The R.O.T.C. encourages a
hopeless attitude toward war. It is
true that a military barracks on our
campus is not likely to produce
cold-blooded militarists; it is also
true, however, that constant contact
with military preparedness during a

four-year term in college leaves its
militaristic scar. The psychological
effect of growing up in a military
environment is too often underes
timated. War is more easily taken
for granted by a generation which
has been taught the necessity for
preparedness and the inevitability
of war. Should the development of
such a generation be encouraged in
