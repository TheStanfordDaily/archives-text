KISMET—At the Varsity Theatre.
Another one of those Hollywood
products not justified by extrava
gant blurbs is "Kismet." Built
around the events of a day in the
life of Hajj, member of the highly
respected Oriental profession of beg
gars, as played by Otis Skinner, the
story reels through an hour of in
trigue in a high Moslem place, with
Loretta Young, as Hajj's daughter,
finally marrying the supposed son
of a gardener, who, of course, turns
out to be the Caliph himself. Those
who expected a picturization of the
unexpurgated Arabian Nights, pre
pared by poetic pre-views, will be
grievously disappointed. It is noth
ing of the kind, being merely a
jumble of harem and court scenes
surpassed by many other cinemas,
but if you like Otis Skinner, "Kis
met" will furnish a mildly pleasant
two hours. —W. R.

THE SPIDER—At the Alcazar Thea
tre. *
With the audience under arrest,
j and the police department guarding
I the doors, William Courtenay as the
j great magician Chatrand, solves the
just-committed murder mystery in
a realistic style that savours of S. S.
Van Dine.
The play opens during a perform
j ance at the "Tivoli Vaudeville Thea
tre." Chatrand the Great appears
for his act, with his mystery mind
! reader. Presto—murder! A seance,
! psychology, and much darkness—
land the guilty person breaks down.

I "The Spider" is a "different" play, j
! filled with plenty of thrills. The
usual supply of comedy relieves 1
! dramatic tension. Courtenay is a '
convincing actor, better as a psych
i ologist than a magician. j

THE SPIDER—At the Alcazar Thea
tre. *
With the audience under arrest,
j and the police department guarding
I the doors, William Courtenay as the
j great magician Chatrand, solves the
just-committed murder mystery in
a realistic style that savours of S. S.
Van Dine.
The play opens during a perform
j ance at the "Tivoli Vaudeville Thea
tre." Chatrand the Great appears
for his act, with his mystery mind
! reader. Presto—murder! A seance,
! psychology, and much darkness—
land the guilty person breaks down.

I "The Spider" is a "different" play, j
! filled with plenty of thrills. The
usual supply of comedy relieves 1
! dramatic tension. Courtenay is a '
convincing actor, better as a psych
i ologist than a magician. j
