A word for, to, and about the un
fortunates struggling for a more
perfect women's gymnasium than
Woodpecker Hall. A pox on such
dilly-dallying, and a kingdom for a
practical means of making the thing
a success! After all, we do need a
bigger, bolder, and better outfit of
co-eds around this place.
A little bit seriously speakingâ€”
they've been more than three
months raising $4,000, which is well
enough in its own method of speak
ing. But with those figures in mind,
the idea of raising four times that
amount in about three weeks is
laughable.
Paging another Pie-Eyed Piper
to whistle (he rats out of their
hard-earned shackles (shekels,
in Hamlin).
And they've authorized us to ad
vertise 'em in any way we see fit.
Being disinclined to frothing on
Thursdays, we're waiting for a
change in the weather.
It was an heroic idea, this
project of irritating $20,000 into
existence by collecting tinfoil
and giving benefits. We raised
24 cents, once, that way, in
grammar school. And it was for
chewing gum, not a gymnasium.
Stick-to-it-iveness was our
motto, and ....
Even if the roughs were interested
in advancing the cause of physical
perfection in will-be alumnae, they
haven't the money to prove it.
The idea of a gym dance to be
given on the day the new gym
starts exercising, is a great deal
better. The sensation of being ac
tually and enthusiastically asked by
a campus woman to go somewhere
besides a .Sunday night supper, will
be restful.
Wonder how many masculine im
ported escoi'ts will hang their hats
on the nail nearest the door? May
Ihe deportment of all Stanford stu
dents be such that no deficiencies
will be reported to the committee
engaged in exporting undesirables.

The Daily says that our cam
pus Chicagoans, Varsity Racquet
Men, Are Holding Their Places
in Tennis Ladder. So they're
even stooping to second-story
work, now?
All of which, being unusually foul
and pointed, is labeled as nothing
more than one long gripe. Better
luck next time.
