### Abe Mellinkoff 
A professor at the University of
! Wisconsin decries the fact that
; modern life is so fast.
Modern life in the form of
pedestrians has to be hurried
with sororities running non
stop, full-speed "specials" from
the library to the sorority lunch
table.
Anybody who attempts crossing
the street in front of the P.O. at
■ noon is either quick, dead, or man
| gled.
A partial survey at the University
of Nebraska would seem to indicate
j that the students there do not favor
I stag lines at campus dances.
The majority at a college may
be against stag lines—called
"the roughs are crashing at
Stanford." There are two classes,
however, who always favor this
custom —tiie roughs themselves,
and those that have been roped
in to accepting "blind dates."
