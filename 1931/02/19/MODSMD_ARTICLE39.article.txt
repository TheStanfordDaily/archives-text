# NEW YORK BANKERS INDICTED
## 
### 
Blind dates arc something like Ihe
old "penny grab bags" that used to
take place in the corner grocery
store —you heard a great number
of rumors about grand prizes, you
always had the excitement of sus
pense, but most of them were so
disappointing.
The University of Colorado won
ders what the student who flunked
out during this wave of unemploy
ment will do.
The college man who flunks out
at present can let his hair grow,
become an intellectual, and live in
a garret; or he can sell bonds; or
continue deriving the benefits of
"home life."
The University of Washington
Daily advocates the abolition of ex
aminations.
That is a positive way of solv
ing the "Honor System" prob
lem. If we have no examina
tions, none of us will l»c able to
cheat and all of us can be

strictly honorable.
Oregon State feels that the applc
! polisher is a worse campus parasite
I than the bookworm or the teahound.
How about the lounge-lizard and
I the nameless creature that disturbs
j everybody in the library every ten
| minutes to go out for a smoke or a
I cup of coffee?
Men fence, box, wrestle, prac
, tice with the rifle, and play
hockey. Iti all these endeavors
they have been copied by the
mis-named weaker sex. Football
alone stood out as the MAN'S
game.
But now one learns that Southern
Methodist University has initiated
classes in football for co-eds.
The game of BRAWN has changed
to a game for blondes and brunettes.
Forty-four of the 14G bus lines
operating in Indiana conducted
business at a loss in 1929.
