Ernie Smith, the man whom
the Call-Bulletin immortalized
as a radio sports announcer
during the past grid season, will
try his hand at putting colle
giate basketball on the air when
lie broadcasts over KTAB the
Indian-Bear hoop tussle from
the Oakland Auditorium Satur
day night. Unless Ernie calms
down a bit from his football en
thusiasm during grid scoring
sprees of last year, he is liable
to find himself a nervous wreck
after a little of that lit-for-tat
basketball which has marked
the Bunn-Price arguments so
far.

It might sound to the radio fan
something like this: "Kintana is
dribbling down the floor, he's going
past Fawcett- no he isn't—Stanford
is now in possession—well, anyway,
somebody made a basket—yes, it
was Moffatt." And we wonder how
Smith will like coming through
every now and then with the talk
about a certain gasoline which puts
"wings on your car." Don Thompson
has' had a patent on that saying,
having used it continuously during
baseball season when he and Ernie
vied with each other over different
stations for the attention of the
radio ball fans.
At any rate, we feel sorry for
those who are not able to attend
Ihe hoop tussle, for the stage is cer
tainly* set for a do-or-die battle.
Nibs Price has issued an official
statement that his boys will be out
to win, and though Bunn refuses to
comment on the matter, we are in
clined to believe that the Indian
coach would not mind winning the
contest either.

The Golden Bear has plenty
at stake, since dropping the tilt
would mean dropping their
title ehanee, provided U.S.C. can
repeat over the Bruins. Then,
too, "His Nibs" is not sure
whether lie will continue coach
ing the court game at the
Berkeley institution, and if he
does leave, he would like to end
his long and successful term
with another conference title
victory. Price's men seem will
ing to lay down their lives lor
their coach, as was demonstrated
last grid season when they even
threatened a strike if the alum
ni. students, and sundry others
did not silence the broadside
lire against him.
Bunn's men, on the other hand,
will have no ti<lo hopes to occupy
their minds; they can concentrate
on that one game, which (.hey, too,
have a reason or so for wanting to
win. One of them is that this is >he
first time in five years that a series
victory over the Blue and Gold has
been anywhere within reach. They
believe in their new coach, also, and
will no doubt be doing everything
they can to bring about his predic
tion, namely that if the Rodshirts
took the first game, they would
grab the series from the Bear.
Reports coming from Berkeley
indicate that Jack Read, high
scoring center of the U.C. five,
lias raised his total, by reason
of his five poinls Saturday night
in the Pavilion, to 104 for 18
Samcs. Phil Moffatt is the lead
ing scorer for the Indians with
!)(► markers in I<> contests. Phil
has certainly become the dcac'.-
cye of (he Cardinal quintet,
crowding Reynolds out of the
lead by tanking six field goals
in the last game. Mike had led
since the third tilt of the season,
and is now i:i second place with
X 7.
Harlow Rothert, on the New Zea
land tour wilh George Simpson and
Rufus Kiser, has already performed
in competition no less than nine
times since January 22 for the bene
fit of the natives of the Island state.
The trio will compete in as many
more meets before they leave for
home about the 25th of March. This
would seem a pretty tough sched
ule for the Ohio sprint star, and not
too easy for Kiser in the mile.
Harlow, however, seems lo be
having little trouble in break
ing and re-breaking the New
Zealand record in the shot put.
Ai present, he has set it at !iO
ft,, inches. We would not
be surprised to sec that record
rise to around 32 feet before the
termination of the tour.

whether lie will continue coach

does leave, he would like to end
his long and successful term

ing to lay down their lives lor
their coach, as was demonstrated
last grid season when they even
threatened a strike if the alum
ni. students, and sundry others
did not silence the broadside

Bunn's men, on the other hand,
will have no ti<lo hopes to occupy
their minds; they can concentrate
on that one game, which (.hey, too,
have a reason or so for wanting to
win. One of them is that this is >he
first time in five years that a series
victory over the Blue and Gold has
been anywhere within reach. They
believe in their new coach, also, and
will no doubt be doing everything
they can to bring about his predic
tion, namely that if the Rodshirts
took the first game, they would
grab the series from the Bear.
Reports coming from Berkeley
indicate that Jack Read, high

lias raised his total, by reason

in the Pavilion, to 104 for 18

ing scorer for the Indians with
!)(► markers in I<> contests. Phil
has certainly become the dcac'.-

crowding Reynolds out of the

in the last game. Mike had led
since the third tilt of the season,
and is now i:i second place with
X 7.
Harlow Rothert, on the New Zea
land tour wilh George Simpson and
Rufus Kiser, has already performed
in competition no less than nine
times since January 22 for the bene
fit of the natives of the Island state.
The trio will compete in as many
more meets before they leave for
home about the 25th of March. This
would seem a pretty tough sched
ule for the Ohio sprint star, and not
too easy for Kiser in the mile.
Harlow, however, seems lo be
having little trouble in break
ing and re-breaking the New
Zealand record in the shot put.
Ai present, he has set it at !iO
ft,, inches. We would not
be surprised to sec that record
rise to around 32 feet before the

Ernie Smith, the man whom

the Oakland Auditorium Satur
day night. Unless Ernie calms
down a bit from his football en
thusiasm during grid scoring
sprees of last year, he is liable
to find himself a nervous wreck
after a little of that lit-for-tat
basketball which has marked
the Bunn-Price arguments so

something like this: "Kintana is

is now in possession—well, anyway,
somebody made a basket—yes, it

Smith will like coming through
every now and then with the talk

"wings on your car." Don Thompson
has' had a patent on that saying,
having used it continuously during
baseball season when he and Ernie
vied with each other over different

At any rate, we feel sorry for

in the last game. Mike had led
since the third tilt of the season,
and is now i:i second place with
X 7.
Harlow Rothert, on the New Zea
land tour wilh George Simpson and
Rufus Kiser, has already performed
in competition no less than nine
times since January 22 for the bene
fit of the natives of the Island state.
The trio will compete in as many
more meets before they leave for
home about the 25th of March. This
would seem a pretty tough sched
ule for the Ohio sprint star, and not
too easy for Kiser in the mile.
Harlow, however, seems lo be
having little trouble in break
ing and re-breaking the New
Zealand record in the shot put.
Ai present, he has set it at !iO
ft,, inches. We would not
be surprised to sec that record
rise to around 32 feet before the
termination of the tour.
