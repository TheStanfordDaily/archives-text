# Varsity Quintet Outclasses Frosh Five, 47-19
## YEARLING DEFENSE CRUMBLES BEFORE BRILLIANT ATTACK Meade Is High Point Man; Packard lakes Tip At Center For Babes 
### 
Flashing a speedy attack which
completely baffled the defense of
the freshman five, the varsity cagers
I ran wild in tho Pavilion yesterday
afternoon to vanquish the first-year
men by a 47 to 19 count.
Reggie Meade, playing but three
fourths of the contest, nevertheless
led the varsity landslide, piling up
12 points and seeming never to miss
the hoop.
Babes Outclassed
After the first few minutes of play
it was evident that the babe court
men were far outclassed. The first
period found the youngsters taking
many more shots at the bucket than
their opponents, though most of
them were from far out.
Phil Moffatt, Meade, and Rey
nolds, *on the other hand, time and
again got behind the babe guards to
tank setup shots, while the varsity
defense was all that could be de
sired.
Packard at center was easily the
outstanding freshman player, get
ting the tip-off repeatedly from
Captain Mike Reynolds. Doub suc
| coeded in getting the jump from the
I lanky yearling later in the game,
though in doing so he fouled four
limes and was therefore ousted from
i the fray.
Passing Sloppy
Sloppy passing on the part of the
babe five cost them humerous
I chances and afforded copious oppcr-
I (unities for the varsity forwards to

! unmolested.
Seaver played steady ball in the
j guard position, while the usually
| dead-eye Topping seemed unable to
: locate the basket, and went out of
I the game on personal fouls with
I only four free throws to his credit.
The refereeing of Jimmy Brad-
I shaw drew many boos and hisses
j from the scattering of fans who
were on hand. Numerous times Re
! feree Bradshaw tossed the ball so
ihigh for jumps that the men would
leap futilly into the air only to
! have the ball come down on them
j some time later. Bradshaw was ac
j cused of having favored the fresh
| man quintet.

Flashing a speedy attack which
completely baffled the defense of
the freshman five, the varsity cagers
I ran wild in tho Pavilion yesterday
afternoon to vanquish the first-year
men by a 47 to 19 count.
Reggie Meade, playing but three
fourths of the contest, nevertheless
led the varsity landslide, piling up
12 points and seeming never to miss
the hoop.
Babes Outclassed
After the first few minutes of play
it was evident that the babe court
men were far outclassed. The first
period found the youngsters taking
many more shots at the bucket than
their opponents, though most of
them were from far out.
Phil Moffatt, Meade, and Rey
nolds, *on the other hand, time and
again got behind the babe guards to
tank setup shots, while the varsity
defense was all that could be de
sired.
Packard at center was easily the
outstanding freshman player, get
ting the tip-off repeatedly from
Captain Mike Reynolds. Doub suc
| coeded in getting the jump from the
I lanky yearling later in the game,
though in doing so he fouled four
limes and was therefore ousted from
i the fray.
Passing Sloppy
Sloppy passing on the part of the
babe five cost them humerous
I chances and afforded copious oppcr-
I (unities for the varsity forwards to
intercept and break down the court
! unmolested.
Seaver played steady ball in the
j guard position, while the usually
| dead-eye Topping seemed unable to
: locate the basket, and went out of
I the game on personal fouls with
I only four free throws to his credit.
The refereeing of Jimmy Brad-
I shaw drew many boos and hisses
j from the scattering of fans who
were on hand. Numerous times Re
! feree Bradshaw tossed the ball so
ihigh for jumps that the men would
leap futilly into the air only to
! have the ball come down on them
j some time later. Bradshaw was ac
j cused of having favored the fresh
| man quintet.
