# FRESHMAN NINE TIES MENLO J.C. TEAM IN PRACTICE GAME
## 
### 
Rain and darkness combined to
cut short a practice ''clash between
the Stanford freshman ball-tossers
and Menlo Junior College yesterday.
The game ended in the sixth inning
after a Menlo rally amassed five
runs to tie the game, six to six.
Anderson, aco of the Stanford
moundsmen, looked good in the
three innings he worked. When he
retired in the third frame to let
Savinskie take his place, he had
held the visitors to or.c run while
striking out five men.
Stanford did a little heavy stick
work in the first frame and com
bined hits to bring three runs across
the pan. Again in the fourth inning,
the babes accounted for another
trio of runs to bring their total up
to six.
Savinskie held off the Menlo
threat in the fourth and fifth cantos,
but they *got to him early in the
sixth for five tallies and tied the
game up in a bag.
