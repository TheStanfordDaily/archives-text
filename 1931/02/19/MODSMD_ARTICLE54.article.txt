# ARIZONA RIDERS invade campus OVER WEEK-END
## Matches Promise To Show Best Intercollegiate Brand Of Polo 
### Lowell Cox 
What is expected to prove the best
intercollegiate polo ever played at
Stanford will be the reward of fans
remaining .on the campus this week
end, when the Redshirt riders clash
with the strong University of Arizona
four in a two-game series.
The Arizona mallet-wielders will
arrive early Saturday morning on
the Sunset Limited, in plenty of
time to prepare for the first game.
The ball will be thrown in Saturday
afternoon at one o'clock, and Mon
day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
McDougall Is Star
The feature of the games should
be the play of Captain Jack Mc-
Dougall of the Farm quartet, and the
hard-riding Brown of the invader,.
Both play No. 3 position.
McDougall is the outstanding
player of the Redshirts, and is con
sidered by his coach, Captain R. A.
Gordan. to be a future candidate for
international play.
Brown, key man for the invaders,
has a four goal handicap. The re
mainder of the Arizona lineup is not
available, although it is known that
the entire team has a rating of 10
goals.
Arizona Undefeated
Undefeated for some 15 games, the
visitors are acknowledged to be the
best collegiate four in the South
west, and many experts rank them
nationally second only to Yale.
Since Stanford occupies a like po
sition as far as the Pacific Coast, this
series may be considered to decide
unofficially the intercollegiate cham
pionship of the West.
