# Indian Nine Defeats Broncs 7-0 In Debut
## Loomis and Johnson Allow Only Three Singles; Campbell's Catch Is Feature of Game 
### 
By FRANCIS LLOYD
superb pitching from Vard Looinis and Dan Johnson, Stanford's
varsity baseball team got off to an auspicious start for a conference
title yesterday afternoon when the Indians defeated the Santa Clara nine
oil the hitter's field by the comfortable margin of 7-0.
For six innings, while Vard Looinis was on the mound for Welter's
men, the Broncos kept going up to the plate and shortly returning to
the bench without having tasted the joys of reaching first, with the
exception of Dowd, who got a scratchy single over second base. Two

; hits were scored off Dan Johnson
during the three innings in which
he pitched, but they were well
j scattered and caused no worry.
After Spud Hardy had secured a
base on balls in the first inning,
Johnny Hunken scored him with a
beautiful clout over center field
which was gqpd for three bases. Dol
mas then scored Captain Hunken
with a slash down the right field
foul line. Campbell ended the in
| ning with a grounder to short. An
-1 other run was scored in the second
' by singles from Eddie and Loomis
i and a long fly to center by Dykes
Johnson.
Stanford Scores
Four singles and an error in the
fourth accounted for a quartet of
markers for Stanford to shove the
I game into the proverbial refriger
i ator. Thomas, the Broncs' starting
! pitcher, was yanked by Mails dur
ing this debacle and O'Daniels took
over the hurling duties and suc
ceeded in retiring the side.
By far the most sensational play
iof the game was the taking by
i Gordy Campbell, after a long run
to his left, a terrifically hard hit by
Dowd into right center field. Camp
bell just managed to get under the
ball by a final quick lunge which |
almost caused him to fall. Hunken,
Philippi, and Loomis were the hit
ting stars for the Indians. Spud
Hardy performed well at the pre
mier sack.
