# GOUGHLIN DEFEATS EASTON, 6-4, 6-3, TO HEAD RANKING
## Rises From Fourth Place To First Varsity Man In Two Weeks 
### 
To further baffle local tennis fans,
I Joe Coughlin yesterday stepped into
the very unsettled position of first
man after winning a set-to with Ted
i Easton by the comparatively de
i cisive score of 6-4, 6-3.
Playing his usual excellent game,
j Coughlin evidently caught the first
man in a slump. Easton's backhand
; continually failed to function, and
! his service was comparatively weak,
i The victor was quick to take ad -
j vantage of these errors in hammer-
I ing his way to the king position.
The former fourth man began his
I upward sprint about two weeks ago
j by defeating Harry Plymire. Easton,
meanwhile, having changed places
i with Gledhill, Coughlin upset the
j dope again last week by trampling
| over the strongly favored former first
i man, placing himself within shoot
j ing distance of the top.
The only other varsity match saw
i John Gordon hold onto eleventh
place, downing Hubert Butler 6-4,
i 6-4.
Practically settling ihe status of
the first four freshmen, Dan Ellis,
: number three, staved off the attack
|of A1 Bogan after a three-set
j struggle, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.
