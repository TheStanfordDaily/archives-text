# BAUER TO GIVE PIANO CONCERT
## Holds Popular Favor With Foreign Audiences 
### 
Harold Bauer, internationally
famous pianist who will play here
in the Pavilion at 8:15 o'clock to
night, is now making his twenty
eighth tour of the United States.

He has become a citizen of the
United States, with his home in
New York, but his popularity in
Germany, Spain, France, Holland,
and England has been extraordin
ary. He was made a member of the
French Legion of Honor in 1927,
was decorated by the London Phil
harmonic Association, and is presi
dent of the Beethoven Association
of America.

Throughout the musical world,
say critics, he commands a prestige
I with the unnumbered host of per
sons who are fond of music without
having a technical knowledge of it.
The reason for this success is the
i careful selection in his programs of
the kind of music the majority of
people like to hear, though he never
makes such a choice at the sacri
! fice of high artistic ideals.

i under the auspices of the A.S.S.U.
