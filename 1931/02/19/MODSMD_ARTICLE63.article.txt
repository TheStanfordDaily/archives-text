## 
### 
Herr Einstein and Professor Milli
kan, campus guests of Albert Wal
ton, instructor in psychology, graci
ously submitted to a public aptitude
test for the advancement of scientific
research, yesterday morning, before
an enthusiastic crowd of Stanford
students at the Little Theatre.

The Intelligence Quotient of Pro
fessor Millikan was officially checked
at 210, which according to psycho
logists in charge of the experiment,
thereby establishes a new world's
record.

Contrary to expectations, Herr i
Einstein failed to boost Millikan's j
mark. The best endeavor of Pro- ;
fessor Einstein, coming after re
peated trials, was 105. It is said that j
the professor was greatly misunder- |
stood, and that if the graders had !
been able to comprehend his |
thoughts, his final mark would have ;
been a great deal higher.
Clara Bow, also a guest of Walton,
failed to put in an appearance. Ru- j
mor has it that she was forced to
withdraw from the contest at the '
last minute because of doctor's or
ders. Late last night Walton prom- i

ised that Clara would compete in j
today's experiments as it had been |
pointed out to her that she should j
appear for "her public's sake."
Aimee Semple McPherson, "Ma"
Kennedy, and Daisy DeVoe are the j
other white rats which will be tested
today in an endeavor to discover the 1
mental correlation, if any, between •
film luminaries, scientists, and !
evangelists.
