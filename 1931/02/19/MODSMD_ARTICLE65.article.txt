# GALLERY DISPLAYS SAMPLES OF WORK BY ART STUDENTS
## Illustrate Modern Trends Of Commercial Art, Subject Changes 
### 
Illustrating the trend of modern
art work toward decorative and
modernistic designs, an exhibition of
nearly 100 samples of the work of
students in the Paget Fredericks de
sign class is being shown at the Art
Gallery for the next two weeks.
Designs for book covers, posters,
will panels, screen and stage settings
are included in the display. They
are done in bold patterns and bril
liant colors.
The display is especially interest
ing to teachers of art since it shows
distinctly the change of art subjects
during the past three years. They
have passed from those of natural
appearance to those of original de
sign.
Fredericks design class is a part
of the California School of Arts and
Crafts at Oakland for 25 years and
is the only art school in the west
granting degree courses in art edu
cation.
Fredericks has done work in stage
decoration and book illustration be
fore entering the employ of the
school. The work of his students
reflects his professional knowledge
of commercial art.
