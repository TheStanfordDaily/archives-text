| SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 18. (/I 3 )—
The great quest in the Gobi Desert
for traces of man's ancestors and
fossils of prehistoric animals is over,
at least as far as Roy Chapman An
-1 drews is concerned.
The last member of the last An
drews expedition—Walter Granger
—arrived here today from the
Orient, accompanied by his wife.
"Andrews has told our story,"
Granger said. "As far as he (An
drews) is concerned this expedition
was the last he will ever undertake.
To my mind it was the most suc
cessful for we discovered hereto-
I fore unknown mammals."
