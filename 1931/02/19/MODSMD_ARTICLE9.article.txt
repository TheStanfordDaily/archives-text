Staging a surprising second half
comeback, El Capitan's basketball
team defeated El Tigre, 24-18, last
night in the Encina gymnasium. The
victory broke the triple tie for the j
leadership of League VII, leaving
Breakers and El Capitan as the two
contenders.

Working out a 16-9 lead during
the first half, El Tigre appeared to
have put the game on ice. Big gun
in their attack was Garibotto, who
contributed eight points to this total.
Capitan Reverses Things
Matters were reversed during the
second period, in which El Capitan
tallied 15 points, El Tigre but 2.
Lack of condition slowed up the lat
ter team, while George Stump
speeded up the former.
The Business School gained the
other victory of the evening from
Alpha Sigma Phi, 29-12. Their
teamwork more than matched the
fine individual play of Bobbie Bax
ter of the Alpha Sigs. Cruickshank
led the Business School attack with
13 points.
In the other game scheduled for
the evening, Delta Tau Delta for
feited to Theta Xi. No contests are
to be played this evening, according
to Parker Reed, director of intra
mural athletics.
