Shakespeare said: "The
play's the thing," but we
say it's the
—PLAYOFF—
at Oakland tomorrow
night. Of course you'll
'■" be there, barring arteri
sclerosis, but don't for-
get to start out with the
car in good running or-
der or you may spend
the evening looking at
stars quite different
"from those at the Audi
torium. Come in early
and let us "fill 'er up"
with gas, oil, and other
■mi Richfield products hav
ing all that real merit
we expect our boys to
show in this last big
game of an exciting sea-
son.
