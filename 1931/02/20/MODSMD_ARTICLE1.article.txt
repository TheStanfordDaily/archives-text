# Indian, Bear Fives Battle Tomorrow For Series Titles
## Final Games to Decide Both Frosh and Varsity Series Winners for First Time in 17 Years; Indians Seeking First Crown Since 1921 FARM QUINTET GIVEN EDGE OVER CALIFORNIANS Man-for-Man Comparison Shows Stanford Stronger at Every Varsity Position Except Center 
### JACK JERNEGAN 
TOMORROW night Stanford varsity and freshman basketball teams will
meet the California Bears at the Oakland Auditorium in the last games
this year. The freshman contest will start at 6:30 o'clock, and the varsities
will take the floor at 8 o'clock. For the first time in the 17 years of hoop
relations between the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold, the final games
will decide the series winner for both the freshman and varsity quintets.
At present the series are even for yearlings and varsity alike, jthe Stanford

teams having each gained one vie-*®
tory and suffered one defeat.
The Redshirt varsity accomplished
one remarkable feat in winning the
first game of the series, something
that had not been done since 1925,
but if they can win the final and
deciding tilt tomorrow they will ac
complish an even more unusual
achievement.
Not since 1921 has a Stanford var
sity won a basketball series from
the Berkeley men, and 1920 was the
only other year that saw the Car
dinal five triumphant.
Stanford Has Edge
Coach Bunn's men have a first
class chance, probably the best since
1921, to add another win to this
rather inglorious record. No one
who saw the first two games of the
present series can discover much
difference in strength between the
two fives, but if one discounts the
phenomenal shooting which the
Bears displayed last Saturday, the
apparent edge lies with Stanford.
The Indians succumbed to a spree
of miraculous accuracy on the part
of the Bear hoopsters, but it is
hardly likely that this performance
will be repeated. In other depart
ments the Redskins have looked a
little better than their opponents.
Their defense was practically im
pregnable last week and left little
to be desired in the initial en
counter of the series. On offense
Captain Reynolds and his pals have
made suckers out of the Bears on
several occasions. Moffatt's final
field goal in the first tilt is one
example of a time when the Cali
fornia defense was caught napping.
Fawcett Best Guard
Man for man Stanford looks just
as good as California. of the
Bears might be given a slight edge
at center over Captain Reynolds, but
Vance Fawcett certainly rates high
er than either of the Berkeley
guards, Coffield and Vendt.
Rudy Rintala can hold his own
with those two men also, while
Moade and Moffatt are perhaps a
trifle superior to Kintana and Davis
at the forward positions.
In reserve strength the Cards are
admittedly far superior, with such
men as Baker, Hancock, Cordry,
Doub, and Tyler ready to go in.
The probable starting lineups are
as follows:
Stanford— California—
Meade F Davis
Moffatt F Kintana
Reynolds C Read
Rintala G Coffield
Fawcett G Vendt ,
