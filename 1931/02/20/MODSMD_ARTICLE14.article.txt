# LARGE GROUP HEARS BAUER IN PROGRAM
## Pianist Features Chopin; Schumann Selections Well Received 
### Helen Thomas 
Displaying a perfection of tech
nique and real depth of feeling,
Harold Bauer, internationally cele
brated pianist, thrilled a large and
appreciative audience in the Pavil
ion last night.
His touch was almost ethereal in
its lightness and his principal melo
dies sang clearly above the accom
paniment. Perhaps the only flaw in
technique was a slight blurring of
the rapid heavier pasasges, and an
over-pedaling that was the fault of
the piano.
Chopin Prominent
The inevitable Chopin of a pian
ist's repertoire became a stirring,
live thing under his fingers. His
of the "B minor Sonata" was
! fortunate one for it is less well
nown than others and gave oppor
anity for original interpretation and
feeling. The 'Andante" movement
was liquid harmony, and the
"Scherzo" gave promise of the
"Catch me if you can" and "Wind"
that were to follow.
Schumann's charming tone poem,
"Scenes from Childhood," amused
and touched the audience with its
quaint pictures. Its moods change
swiftly and are in direct contrast
to one another. The delightful
"Rockilng Horse," and beautiful
"Traumerei" are most characteristic
of the composer's lyric charm.
Unusual Music
The last section of the program
was devoted to more modern and
unusual music. Debussy's "Soiree
dans Grenade," with its unique har
mony and sudden crescendos, was
as lovely as was the shivering
"Wind" of Alkan, that whistled and
sighed up and down the length of
the keyboard with unbelievable rap
idity.
In response to the insistent de
mands of the audience, Bauer played
three encores, in keeping with the
rest of his program. They were:
Chopin's "Butterfly Etude" and
"Grand Waltz," and the "Sonata in
A major," by Scarlatti.
The concert was the fourth of the
series given under the auspices of
the A.S.S.U. Concert Office.
