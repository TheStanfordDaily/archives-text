# New York Psychologist Deplores Lockout Rule
## 
### Dorothy Brown 
Dr. Lorine Pruette, member of
the psychological clinic of New York
City, who has" been on the campus
for the past two days lecturing on
women's problems, was interviewed
yesterday on the problems that arc
confronting Stanford women.
Asked about women's lockout
regulations, Dr. Pruette replied,
"Differentiation between men and
women is theoretically unjustified.
Anything that can happen after 2:30
o'clock can happen before that
time." She expressed the belief that
women should not be any more
limited in their liberty to come and
go at will than arc the men.
500 Arc Lucky
Concerning the limited number of
women at Stanford, Dr. Pruette said
that there was undoubtedly a hap
pier atmosphere, although she in
terjected, "It depends on how the
girl takes the situation, especially
as in one case cited, where there is
only one girl in a class in one of
the professional schools. We must
break down sex-consciousness, be
cause inhibitions have warped the
activities of both men and women."
Co-education finds favor with Dr.
Pruette by inference in the state-

| menl: "If a girl wants to become a
' social ornament and lead a life of
luxury, the finishing school as it
exists today is all right.
Favors Careers
"With early marriages, we might
be able to work out a better sys
tem than the one which we have at
present," she declared. 'By the
time a woman is ready for her
career, her children will be old
enough to interfere only slightly
with her business duties. A profes
sional woman takes family responsi
bilities much more seriously, re-
I serving special hours each day for
j such activities."
In the matter of home life, she
stressed the necessity for more co
operation between husband and
wife in running household affairs,
in order to provide better oppor
tunity for professional success. In
the same connection she declared
that divorce should lie made simple,
with the elimination of collusion
and high attorney's fees.
Regarding the choice of profes
sion. Dr. Pruette indicated that the
vast range of individual differences
rather than sex differences should
i determine suitability for life work.
