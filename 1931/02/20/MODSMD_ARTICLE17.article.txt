# Elaborate Sets For Next Drama Hard To Handle
## Oil Portrait To Be Made By Josephine Lane 
### 
Rich, careless, crowded, comfort
j able, the room in which all the ac
tion for "The Royal Family," to be
presented Friday, February 27 in the
Assembly Hall, takes place has noth-
J ing about it of the commonplace. It
is obviously lived in by an unusual
family. According to Fred Stover,
technical director of the production,
the set for the forthcoming play is
, more difficult to handle than was
that used in "Wings Over Europe."
A winding staircase leading to a
j balcony at the back of the set is a
i unique feature. Tapestries and rich
shawls hung over the balcony rail,
! a colorful brocade draped on the
grand piano, and a profusion of
j flowers combine to make an elab
orate and striking scene.
Painting Used in Set
I Prominently placed in the room is
| an oil painting of the late Aubrey
| Cavendish. Josephine Lane, a stu
j dent in the graphic art department
is making this portrait. She did the
one used above the fireplace in
j "Wings Over Europe."
All sorts of periods and styles have
J gone into furnishing the Cavendish
! duplex. Straight chairs of the time
!of Louis XIV, a tapestry-covered
| armchair of Louis XV, an old-fash
j ioned chinz T covered chair, and old
J English bench are only a few of the
pieces typical of different period.
I Lamps, magazines, ash trays, and
i small tables clutter up the room in
j true Bohemian style.
Few Changes in Sets
There are very few changes in the
j scene from one act to the next. The
lighting effects are the major dif
ferences. Despite the fact that a
year's time elapses between the sec
ond and third acts, the general ar
rangement of the room remains the
i same.
According to Stover, the set de-
I signed for "The Royal Family" is a
"dramatic set for a dramatic family."
