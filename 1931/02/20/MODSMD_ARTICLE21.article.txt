# Senate Passes Bill For Veterans' Loan By Large Majority
## Administration's Worst Defeat Registered as Measure Is Rushed Through Upper House; Supporters Include Numerous Republicans 
### 
. Feb. 19. (/1 J ) —The Senate passed the Veterans' Loan Hill
tonight, 72 to 12. completing one of the most devastating routs of the
] Administration on Capitol Hill in the term of President Hoover.
The measure to which the President only yesterday voiced his vigorous
objections was rushed through the Senate with not only the votes of .'J4
Republicans for it but with the support of many of these Administration
members in debate also. The bill would allow World War veterans to
borrow up to half the amount of the face value of their compensation
certificates—an average of $500 to each of the 15.400,000 ex-service men.

It was passed by the Senate in
the identical form in which the
House approved it, 363 to 39, on
Monday. Bolstered with these tre
mendous majorities the legislation
will be sent to the White House to
morrow and a certain veto was fore
cast.
Hoover Veto Likely
Alarm that the measure might be
killed by a pocket veto without re
turning it to Congress before ad
journment was stilled late in the
day by semi-official word from the
White House that Mr. Hoover would
veto it within 48 hours.
Senator Copeland, Democrat, New
York, proposed to cut the interest
rate from W/t to 3 per cent to be
charged on the loans but he yielded
to pleas to withdraw this so that
the House bill might be sped to the
White House without necessity for
a conference.
Billion To Be Loaned
Early adjournment of the House
before the Senate could vote pre
vented the measure from being sent
to the White House tonight. The
rules require that the Speaker sign
bills in the presence of the House.
President Hoover has said he be
lieved at least $1,00d,000,000 will be
borrowed by the veterans under the
legislation. Under-Secretary Mills
said this will require the Treasury
to float a bond issue.
