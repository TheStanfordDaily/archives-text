# PROCTOR PLAN ADVOCATED BY STUDENT HEAD
## Edmonds Says Honor Code Has Had Sufficient Trial At Stanford FLAYS GRADE SYSTEM Better Enforcement Need If Code Retained 
### 
Unless the Honor Code proves
itself capable of better enforcement
than it has had in the past, it must
be replaced by a proctor system,
Warner Edmonds, new member of
Men's Council, believes. And that
responsibility for enforcement lies
to a greater extent with the student
body itself than with the Council.
"Personally, I favor a proctor sys
tem,'' Edmonds declared in an in
terview last night. "I think the
honor system has had enough of a
trial to prove that it never can work
to complete satisfaction. On the
other hand, neither do I believe that
a proctor system would be abso
lutely perfect, but I am sure that it
would produce much better results
than the Honor Code is at the pres
ent time.
Favors Strict Enforcement
"However, as long as the Code is
in effect, I feel that it is entitled
to the fullest support of the Council
and that it should receive the strict
est enforcement possible. Where the
evidence is plainly sufficient to
prove guilt in cases of Honor Code
violation, the student should be con
victed, his name published, and ex
pulsion from Stanford made the
penalty.
"Control over the proceedings
should rest completely with the
Men's Council; there must be no
faculty intervention.
"The fact that the Code is not
receiving complete student support
is, in my opinion, sufficient evidence
of its ver> incomplete success and
justification for installation of a sys
tem of proctors. The only remedy
which will allow retaining of the
Code is a consciousness on the part
of the student body to the system
and a complete backing of it."
Believes Publicity Needed
Asked what he considered the
most efficacious means of bringing
the system to the active attention of
the student body, Edmonds declared,
"Publicity in the Daily, in both the
editorial and news columns, is in
valuable. Also, the recent flood of
letters to the Daily's 'Campus Opin
ion' column indicates a rise of stu
dent interest, which is encouraging.
"The grade system, I believe, is
responsible to a large extent for the
number of honor violations," Ed
monds continued. "As a side-issue
of the grade system, the publication
of ratings in the Bawlout is un
doubtedly a highly detrimental fac
tor, since it encourages rivalry of
an unhealthy nature. I maintain that
abolition of the grade system would
be a big factor in improvement of
the situation, but student backing is
the fundamental basis upon which
successful enforcement of the Code
must be built."
Thinks Selection (iood
In answer to the question, "Would
more caieful selection of entering
students effect any improvement?"
Edmonds declared, "Entrance re
quirements are such already that I
fail to sec how any improvement in
freshmen could be made.
"Cheating must be present to
some extent in any group the size
of the Stanford student body, and
it is only the extent which we can
regulate. I don't think that it will
ever be possible to have absolutely
perfect enforcement, no matter what
system we use."
