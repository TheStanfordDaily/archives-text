# LET'S NOT GO BACKWARD

Once again Ihe Five Hundred are discussing the A.W.S.
finles and Hegulations. Some say that the rules are too
stringent, others that the women should have no restric
tions. Hut 110 blanket statement as to whether or not it has
heen a success or failure can be made until the whole trial
period has passed.
As the situation stands at present, the women have been
granted an added privilege during the trial period of HKJO
of staying out until o'clock at night. During this
time, certain difficulties have become manifest in the
administration of the new rules made necessary by this
change. As a result, the success of a new system including
this added leeway of one hour over any previous late
leaves, seems dubious to many.
That extra hour makes a great difference when return
ing to the campus from dancing in San Francisco. He
sides this, ;i mid-week :.'5(» leave for dancing in the city is
a much-appreciated leniency for those who prefer iin
crowded floors. The hour of return was extended for just
these occasions.
Hut there are other elements to be considered. The
latest leave now granted during the middle of the week
for other reasons than dancing is 11 :!U) o'clock, and no
one can ever attend a cultural event in the city and be back
on the campus by th«t time.
One of the greatest weaknesses, however, is the fact that
many freshmen women are going beyond the bounds of
good sense and taking too many 2:.'}() leaves. All this can
be cured by changes in the rules, if changes are considered
necessary at the end of the year.
The women who have taken too many leaves are those
who have caused the disturbance, and they are the ones
who may cause the withdrawal of the privilege. If the
system is to be continued in the future, and it has cer
tainly merited being retained, ample provision will have
to be made for extremists who wander from the Golden
Mean.
Dr. Pruette says that "Differentiation between men and
women is theoretically unjustified.'" So it is in many cases,
but unfortunately not all parents \yho send their children
to college are in favor of sudden emancipation for the
women.
Hut this privilege has been a real step forward for Stan
ford women and all American college women who contend
they are old enough to take care of themselves. They
worked hard for the 2:.'Ws and found them worth keeping,
(living them up would be a backward step.

on the campus by th«t time.
One of the greatest weaknesses, however, is the fact that
many freshmen women are going beyond the bounds of
good sense and taking too many 2:.'}() leaves. All this can
be cured by changes in the rules, if changes are considered
necessary at the end of the year.
The women who have taken too many leaves are those
who have caused the disturbance, and they are the ones
who may cause the withdrawal of the privilege. If the
system is to be continued in the future, and it has cer
tainly merited being retained, ample provision will have
to be made for extremists who wander from the Golden
Mean.
Dr. Pruette says that "Differentiation between men and
women is theoretically unjustified.'" So it is in many cases,
but unfortunately not all parents \yho send their children
to college are in favor of sudden emancipation for the
women.
Hut this privilege has been a real step forward for Stan
ford women and all American college women who contend
they are old enough to take care of themselves. They
worked hard for the 2:.'Ws and found them worth keeping,
(living them up would be a backward step.
Once again Ihe Five Hundred are discussing the A.W.S.
finles and Hegulations. Some say that the rules are too
stringent, others that the women should have no restric
tions. Hut 110 blanket statement as to whether or not it has
heen a success or failure can be made until the whole trial
period has passed.
As the situation stands at present, the women have been
granted an added privilege during the trial period of HKJO
of staying out until o'clock at night. During this
time, certain difficulties have become manifest in the
administration of the new rules made necessary by this
change. As a result, the success of a new system including
this added leeway of one hour over any previous late
leaves, seems dubious to many.
That extra hour makes a great difference when return
ing to the campus from dancing in San Francisco. He
sides this, ;i mid-week :.'5(» leave for dancing in the city is
a much-appreciated leniency for those who prefer iin
crowded floors. The hour of return was extended for just
these occasions.
Hut there are other elements to be considered. The
latest leave now granted during the middle of the week
for other reasons than dancing is 11 :!U) o'clock, and no
one can ever attend a cultural event in the city and be back
on the campus by th«t time.
