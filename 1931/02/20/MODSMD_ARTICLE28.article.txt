# COLLEGE STUFF!

Two interesting sidelights on college life outside the
United States were brought out by news dispatches yester
day, and after reading tlieni, one slops to wonder if the
American college youth is such a virile animal, after all.
In Mexico (lily, a National I'niversitv freshman objected
to sophomore discipline by fleeing from second-year men
who were shaving his head. One of the disciplinary crew
drew a pistol and calmly shot the freshman in the leg.
Today, the news story states, university officials "are con
sidering prohibiting all carrying of pistols by students,
save by special permit."
The old grads who moan about the Stanford rough of
the good old days might do well to rack their brains and
decide whether the rough of naughty-naught was as hard
boiled as some of Mexico's sophomores.
The other angle was brought to light in London, where
a famous Oxford oarsman, who for many years was a row
ing coach in this country, declared that the drinking athlete
would beat the teetotaller every time. The statement was
made in answer to Lady Astor's pronouncement in the
Mouse of (luminous that Kngland was losing on the cricket
field because her players drank.
"In my own experience as an oarsman, over 2N years,"
the coach said, "I was never beaten by a teetotaller, and 1
drank all the alcohol, wine and beer 1 could buy, beg or
borrow."
Such is life'in Merrie Kngland, but can you picture the
star halfback rushing up to the bar and exclaiming, "A pint
of stout, my man, and make it fast; 1 must go oul and die
for dear old Kutgers"?
