## A 						SENSIBLE SUGGESTION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The argument over the recent
election has been settled by legal
authority, and an anti-climax has
been added by Mr. Gould. It might
be well, now, to point out the thing
that caused all this misunderstand
ing. Mr. Gould, in his communica
tion, used the word "primary." I
have heard this word used often
during the past few days in refer
ence to the original election. In
political nomenclature a primary is
an election of nominees, who then
run for office in a future election.
Therefore, the opinion of Mr. Govdd
and others to the contrary notwith
standing, Stanford has no such
thing as a primary election. The
original election is a general one,
designed to put directly into office
those nominated by petition.
But the misunderstanding comes
because of the fact that in practi
cally every election at Stanford a
revote is necessary. However, in no
sense, does this make the first elec
tion a primary; the original election
still remains the true one and the
revote is only a means of determin
ing who is elected in case no one
receives a majority. A careful read
ing of Mr. Cat heart's decision will
reveal why no other person is al
lowed to compete. I believe Mr.
Gould is stretching a point when he
announces that this decision will 'set
a precedent .. . . (by which) . . . .
any sort of a political coup will be
tolerated in the primaries with the
reassuring knowledge that nothing
can be done about it."
Now Mr. Gould intimates that the
"much-improved" A.S.S.U. consti
tution is not all that it should be.
I agree with hiiji, although not in
the specific point of which he com
plains. My objection is of these re
votes. They are a needless waste of
time and money. New ballots must
be printed. Voters must turn out
again. There is a system by which
the same results as are now obtained
by an election and a revote could

' bo obtained in one election. I refer
to the preferential system of ballot
ing.
Before going into the workings of
this system, it might be well to point
out why a revote is necessary under
> the present conditions. Lei us sup
pose that in an original election
Mr. A receives 100 votes; Mr. B
receives 80 voles; and Mr. C re-
I ceives 40 votes. Now it is obvious
1 that Mi'. Cis not the voters' choice
| for the office; yet since Mr. A ciid
not receive a majority of the votes
i cast, it is necessary to find out who
| these backers of Mr. C would have
1 voted for if Mr. C's name had not
been on the ballot. It may be (as is
j often the case in our elections) that
! enough of Ihem would have voted
for Mr. B to give him the majority,
i Therefore a revote is necessary.
Under the preferential system it
j is not. In this system voters mark
i their ballots 1, 2, 3 in order of their
J preference. During the first count
I only the number l's are considered
! â€”just as under our present system.
If, however, it is found that no one
has received a majority for a par
ticular office (as in the above illus
-1 tration) the second choices on Mr.
I C's ballots are' examined and added
: to the total of each of the other
! two candidates. The one having the
i majority is elected. The same rule
applies in case there are more than
! three candidates.
There is another method some
' times used under the preferential
i system which involves the counting
i of the second choices for all candi
j dates, but as this sometimes neces
-1 sitates a revote, I believe that the
method I have outlined is the
! superior one.
This system is not a wild and
untried scheme, but one that is in
Ose in other schools and in other
organizations where no primary is
! used. I suggest it to you, Mr. Editor,
| and to the student body as a means
of doing away with the waste of the
; present revotes.
Sincerely, Ray H. Lindman.
