# USELESS BLAH?

; The Editor, Sir:
Judging from your most honor
! able newspaper it would seem that
i Stanford has gotten itself unneces
sarily overheated about an honor
I system or something like that. It is
difficult to comprehend the exact
utility of the controversy. Perhaps
i it is being carried on in an effort
to add an element of humor to the
1 informing columns of your news
paper, at any rate it seems to be
doing right well in making an en
joyable comic section out of the
Campus Opinion column.
Supposedly we came to Stanford
; to learn some of the things that we
i didn't already know, or at least to
I grab off a little knowledge that
might sometime help in getting a
' job. It is immaterial what grade the
' registrar happens to deal us each
1 quarter as long as we don't roll out
; and are plus at least one when the
judment day descends during some
I future June.
! It has been assumed that we are
here to learn, at least, that's what 1

! is supposed to happen. If that is the
case, why should we care what the
grade as long as we do learn and
manage to graduate? What if some
body does cheat? He only gets a
more symmetrical looking letter
added to his transcript and a few
more numbers after his name in
the bawl-out. Is that an achievement
worth worying about? Maybe it is
to you and to this grossly exagger
ated number of racketeers who have
so rudely shaken the conservative
foundation that holds up a goodly
chunk of this University. To me it
is a huge joke. Ten years from now
you? probably won't remember
whether or not the grade was sym
metrical, full of right-angles or
what-not. That is. if you graduated,
and if you learned anything during
the four years, thereby accomplish
ing your original purpose, you prob
ably got something in return for
your diploma fee.
So why all this useless blah that
crowds this comic section, daily?
