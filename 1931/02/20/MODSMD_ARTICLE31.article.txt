# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
With debates and musicians and
I smoke-ups off our minds, we have
1 a hugely sporting week-end ahead
j of us. The flat-broke idealists among
us, who couldn't afford train fare
South, and have a Saturday morn
ing class, anyway, are going to get
Ihe best en dof the deal in a good
many ways.

Our Indian swimmers (the
hoys who never flinch at cross
ing even very slushy places),
will compete for honors against
the original fresh-water Web
footers from Oregon, this after
noon. Clapp Desjardins sounds
more like the secret-password
to a society of collegiate mys
tics, than a couple of names for
the hill-boards. But they usual
ly bring results.

And tonight we're turning fight
minded. Anyone who gety worn out
brawling at Toyon Club's flashy for
; mal will be expected to drop in for
a look at the boxing matches. 'S a
fine way to work off excess energy.
And wouldn't it be funny, some
: time, if a baketball official got
mixed up in an encounter between
two of the heftiest heavyweights in
the Santa Clara valley. (No, not. a
i campus cop or the bus-driver. A
hefty weight, like that forward little
| Cordry boy, for instance.)

| After that's over, it'll be "To i
I horse, and away to the polo field— j
! Free parking for the Cause." The I
Arizona cowboy team, which is pro- j
! claimed second only to Yale, in this
| country, will invade Stanford ter
jiitory, playing two games, Saturday 1
I and Monday, and hoping to carry '
off strings of scalps. A new kind of ;
scalping, we might say, for this polo
field. (Office hours 10 o'clock till
| midnight, any week, by appoint
j ment.)
The best of all, of course, will i
be when George Washington
Stanford Jr. takes his little red
hatchet and kills a couple of
i yellow bears on his way to the
cherry patch, Saturday evening.
We cannot tell a lie—we think
they ought to win by about six
points. What's your wager?
They ran off the famous old Irish
I marathon yesterday afternoon. The
. boys looked rather more red than \
; appropriately green, though, at the
\ finish.
—
If someone besides an athlete
ever did something interesting
AND puhlishahle, on campus,
Cabbages wouldn't be putting
out a sports column every Fri
day and Monday. And the world
would he a dam sight safer for
I audacity. We thank you.

If someone besides an athlete
ever did something interesting
AND puhlishahle, on campus,
Cabbages wouldn't be putting
out a sports column every Fri
day and Monday. And the world
would he a dam sight safer for
I audacity. We thank you.
With debates and musicians and
I smoke-ups off our minds, we have
1 a hugely sporting week-end ahead
j of us. The flat-broke idealists among
us, who couldn't afford train fare
South, and have a Saturday morn
ing class, anyway, are going to get
Ihe best en dof the deal in a good
many ways.

Our Indian swimmers (the
hoys who never flinch at cross
ing even very slushy places),
will compete for honors against
the original fresh-water Web
footers from Oregon, this after
noon. Clapp Desjardins sounds
more like the secret-password
to a society of collegiate mys
tics, than a couple of names for
the hill-boards. But they usual
ly bring results.

And tonight we're turning fight
minded. Anyone who gety worn out
brawling at Toyon Club's flashy for
; mal will be expected to drop in for
a look at the boxing matches. 'S a
fine way to work off excess energy.
And wouldn't it be funny, some
: time, if a baketball official got
mixed up in an encounter between
two of the heftiest heavyweights in
the Santa Clara valley. (No, not. a
i campus cop or the bus-driver. A
hefty weight, like that forward little
| Cordry boy, for instance.)

| After that's over, it'll be "To i
I horse, and away to the polo field— j
! Free parking for the Cause." The I
Arizona cowboy team, which is pro- j
! claimed second only to Yale, in this
| country, will invade Stanford ter
jiitory, playing two games, Saturday 1
I and Monday, and hoping to carry '
off strings of scalps. A new kind of ;
scalping, we might say, for this polo
field. (Office hours 10 o'clock till
| midnight, any week, by appoint
j ment.)
The best of all, of course, will i
be when George Washington
Stanford Jr. takes his little red
hatchet and kills a couple of
i yellow bears on his way to the
cherry patch, Saturday evening.
We cannot tell a lie—we think
they ought to win by about six
points. What's your wager?
They ran off the famous old Irish
I marathon yesterday afternoon. The
. boys looked rather more red than \
; appropriately green, though, at the
\ finish.
