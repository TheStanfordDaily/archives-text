The sophomore president at Michi
gan State College claims that somcf
freshmen walk around as 1 hough
they had a first mortgage on the
prexy's office.
After a freshman rur.hee It as
been told by 10 fraternities that
he is a nugget, that he should
be playing first string rather
than rubbing splinters off (be
bench, that he must carry a club
to beat off campus queens, and
other stories, it is a wonder that
the freshman does not feel be
owns the office and has leased it
to the president rather than just
holding the first mortgage.
A survey conducted at Ore<*nn

State College reveals that loafing is 1
| an important college activity.
But after all, is not the purpose
of colleges to train gentlemen—and
j a gentleman is one who can do noth
ing gracefully.
And it is only in loafing that
one can learn how to blow per
fect smoke rings, pack a pipe
i satisfactorily, and in all ways
lie a real "college guy."'
Stanford may often lead but
l sometimes sho can learn. Ohio State
College has initiated a class in j
table-waiting for students.
The Greeks staged their an
nual interfratcrnity snowball
light at the University of Illinois.
No casualties were reported, but
i 7i> windows were broken. One
i house, driven to desperation by

sustaining a loss of 20 window
panes, manned their air-rifles
to drive off invaders.
Some cynical critics of college life i
will point lo this as evidence of the j
type of men universities are breed
ing. But after all, boys will be boys, j
and 75 windows are only 75 win- j
dows.
The higher people in life step to j
the front in the form of a Univer- j
sity of Wisconsin professor and con- j
demn modern movies as distortions, i
That is probably true; but many j
men students dream of the Utopian j
college where some of these movie
distortions like Garbo, Bow, Diet- i
rich, and Harding will find iheir j
way to university campuses.
The University of Washington '
Daily claims that efficient cramming
usually serves its purpose.
That may he true hut the big
problem is how to cram effi
ciently. That is almost like say
ing the fast runner wins the
race but the problem still re
mains of how to be fast.
