A DRAMA, FOLKS
John Doe, perusing by habit
the sports page of any S.F.
newspaper, would probably no
tice that there will l>e played in
the Oakland Auditorium tomor
row night a game of basketball
between teams representing
Stanford University and the
University of California. He will
110 doubt guess that both teams
would like to win the contest,
since opponents in any kind of
competition usually do.
But there is drama, friends, in
this third and deciding hoop strug
gle between these ancient rivals in
sport. The season's hopes of both
teams, of the fans in both institu
tions, and of the rival coaches, hinge
upon this one ball game. For the
fivQ.that wins, it will be the tri
umphant climax to a successful sea
son; for the quintet that loses, it
will be a disappointing finish to just
another year of basketball competi
tion.
Along in early September of
1930, a new coach came to the
Farm. After a month of pre-sea
son practice he stated: "There is
a dearth of centers at this in
stitution." So he took an ex
perienced guard and made a
pivot man of him. lie also found
a natural-horn guard in the lot
who had been playing forward
for Cardinal teams for three
long years, and put that man in
his rightful position where he
is now (lie bulwark 011 defense,
the steadying influence of the
Indian five, and the key man of
Bunn's attack.
And so this new coach molded a
basketball team. He talked person
ally with men who had not turned
out. for the cage game the preceding
year, among them being a forward
who has developed into the marks
man of the squad, and now leads
his teammates in scoring, with 90
points. In spite of all obstacles, this
man Bunn put an outfit on the floor
which won ball games. It took one
tilt from each conference opponent,
including the first Stanford win in
five years over a Blue and Gold
quintet.
Th ree weeks ago this Indian hoop
outfit was tied for the lead in the
title race. Fans were pinching them
selves to make sure it was not all a
dream. But the championship hopes
faded away when a Golden J3ear
that could not miss the bucket
avenged its first defeat by taking
the second game of the series last
Saturday night. The deciding tilt
remains, and in it the Indians have
a chance to climax the season with
the first series win from the Bear
since 1923.
California's stalwarts, on the
other hand, will be battling for
the conference crown. They will
also be doing all they can to
avoid becoming the first Blue
and Gold five to drop two out
of three to the Cardinal in many
a year. Their mentorfi who may
end his coaching career at
Berkeley with the end of the
court season, will also be very
much against having his last
Berkeley team gain this distinc
tion. —Crawford.

his rightful position where he
is now (lie bulwark 011 defense,
the steadying influence of the
Indian five, and the key man of
Bunn's attack.
And so this new coach molded a
basketball team. He talked person
ally with men who had not turned
out. for the cage game the preceding
year, among them being a forward
who has developed into the marks
man of the squad, and now leads
his teammates in scoring, with 90
points. In spite of all obstacles, this
man Bunn put an outfit on the floor
which won ball games. It took one
tilt from each conference opponent,
including the first Stanford win in
five years over a Blue and Gold
quintet.
Th ree weeks ago this Indian hoop
outfit was tied for the lead in the
title race. Fans were pinching them
selves to make sure it was not all a
dream. But the championship hopes
faded away when a Golden J3ear
that could not miss the bucket
avenged its first defeat by taking
the second game of the series last
Saturday night. The deciding tilt
remains, and in it the Indians have
a chance to climax the season with
the first series win from the Bear
since 1923.
California's stalwarts, on the
other hand, will be battling for
the conference crown. They will
also be doing all they can to
avoid becoming the first Blue
and Gold five to drop two out
of three to the Cardinal in many
a year. Their mentorfi who may
end his coaching career at
Berkeley with the end of the
court season, will also be very
much against having his last
Berkeley team gain this distinc
tion. —Crawford.
A DRAMA, FOLKS
John Doe, perusing by habit
the sports page of any S.F.
newspaper, would probably no
tice that there will l>e played in
the Oakland Auditorium tomor
row night a game of basketball
between teams representing
Stanford University and the
University of California. He will
110 doubt guess that both teams
would like to win the contest,
since opponents in any kind of
competition usually do.
But there is drama, friends, in
this third and deciding hoop strug
gle between these ancient rivals in
sport. The season's hopes of both
teams, of the fans in both institu
tions, and of the rival coaches, hinge
upon this one ball game. For the
fivQ.that wins, it will be the tri
umphant climax to a successful sea
son; for the quintet that loses, it
will be a disappointing finish to just
another year of basketball competi
tion.
Along in early September of
1930, a new coach came to the
Farm. After a month of pre-sea
son practice he stated: "There is
a dearth of centers at this in
stitution." So he took an ex
perienced guard and made a
pivot man of him. lie also found
a natural-horn guard in the lot
who had been playing forward
for Cardinal teams for three
long years, and put that man in
his rightful position where he
is now (lie bulwark 011 defense,
the steadying influence of the
Indian five, and the key man of
Bunn's attack.
