# TWO BASEBALL TILTS PLANNED
## Saints, Winged "O" Meet Varsity Outfit 
### 
The week-end of Washington's
birthday is offering a very interest
ing fare for baseball fans on the
Farm. The Indians meet the highly
touted Saint Mary's nine on Satur
day for Stanford's second conference
tilt, and then on Monday the Olym
pic Club tossers will play in the
local park.
Whether or not the Cardinals can
take the Gaels into camp may prove
a deciding factor in conference
hopes. Described as a good balanced
team with several competent pitch
ers and a good portion of "heavy
artillery" in the batting order, the
Saint Mary's outfit will be far more
stiff opposition than the Bronco nine.
Not having to use Dan Johnson,
the ace of the pitching staff, for the
full route last Wednesday against
Santa Clara, has given Wolter a
fairly good command of the pitch
ing selection lor Saturday. Either
Frank Milsap or Ernie Caddel will
start on the mound for the Indians.
If they can go the full distance for
the Farm outfit, well and good;
otherwise Dan Johnson will be put
in to finish the game.
Plenty of Pitchers
fast ball is under com
plete control, and mixed in with his
rapid-breaking curves, makes a
baffling contrast to the more slow
ball type of delivery of Milsap. Wol
ter also has Jim Eddie for mound
duty if the occasion should arise.
However, Eddie showed to such
good advantage at right field against
Santa Clara that he will undoubted
ly be kept in this position if pos
sible.
The fact that Don, Pihl did not
get any hits against the Broncs
makes the selection of a catcher as
difficult as last week. Art Miller
and Ike Livermore are the two can
didates for ihe receiving position. A
superiority in hitting will no doubt
decide the issue between the three
men.
