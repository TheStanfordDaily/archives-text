# Freshman Quintets In Crucial Contest
## Preliminary Fray at Oakland Tomorrow Night Expected To Equal Varsity Game for Thrills 
### L. M. C 
I7OUR times since 1924 Stanford freshman basketball fives have won the
annual series with the California Cubs, and tomorrow night they hope
to make it five times. After losing the lirst of this year's games, 22 to 39,
and winning the second, 42 to 39, the babes will meet the Cubs in the
Oakland auditorium in tomorrow night's preliminary to the varsity
game on even terms. The game, which will begin at (i:3O o'clock, is
expected to rival the varsity fray for thrills. Only the possibility of a
slump stands between the Farm yearlings and victory, because they
Â® demonstrated last week that they

are entirely capable of stopping the
j Cubs.
Drill on Fundamentals
Sudden attacks of sloppy passing
j and loose defense allowed the Caii
| fornials to cvecp up dangerously
I close in last Saturday's contest, af
jter-the Indian youngsters had twice
I run up substantial leads. Coach John
Bunn has devoted much of this
| week's work to fundamentals, and
j the babes showed improvement in
practice yesterday, the final strenu
ous session of the week.
Maentz will again start at forward
in place of Massey, Coach Bunn an
nounced last night, but the latter
will undoubtedly see considerable
service in the game. Topping, high
point man last Saturday, will of
course be at the other wing, with
Packard at center and Jenkins at
one guard.
Seaver May Start
Only one other position is in
doubt, with Seaver a possibility to
start at guard in place of Wright.
California's ace, Captain Hal
Eifert, is again expcted to play to
morrow night, his broken left wrist
encased in a special steel brace. In
spite of this handicap, he ran up a
total of 17 points last week tying
with Topping.
Sorrich or Essner will be paired
with Eifert at forward, with Cough
lin at center and McGarrey and
Sublett at the guard posts.
Records show that since 1917
California yearling quintets have
won 10 out of the 14 series played,
but once the Indian babes broke
into the win column, they began
coming out on top regularly.
Since 1924, when the Farm
youngsters won their first series,
they have taken four of the re
maining seven series, and a win
tomorrow night would increase their
lead to five out of eight.

Scientists have discovered how to
make a red blood element.
