# MILLS SPORTS DAY CHANGED TO NEXT AUTUMN QUARTER
## Class Team Competition Planned To Heighten School Interest 
### 
Postponement until November 7,
next fall quarter, of the women's
spring sports clay held annually by
Mills College, University of Califor
nia, and Stanford, was the decision
of the conference composed of mem
bers from each institution which
met in San Francisco this week.

The date of the annual triangular
sports day was necessarily changed
because of the incompletion of the
new gymnasium resulting in the al
teration of the sports schedule. Con
flicting events at the three universi
ties were also given as a reason for
the change.
A new plan will be featured
whereby class teams from one uni
versity will compete against the
same class team of another univer
siiy, instead of the former system
of having each team made up of
representatives from all three in
stitutions. It is hoped that in this
way teamwork rather than indi
vidual playing may be stressed.
Main events of the play day will
be interclass hockey, tennis, swim
ming, and archery. Luncheon will
be served in the gymnasium, with
stunts given by each school after
wards. Probably these will include
songs, exhibition tumbling, and
dancing.
Representatives at the conference
consisted of two members of the
faculty and two women from the
athletic organizations. Those attend
ing from Stanford were Dr. Bertha
Dyment, Director of Physical Edu
cation for Women, Miss Gertrude
Hawley, Director of Roble Gymna
sium, Gertrude Laidlaw, W.A.A.
president, and Beatrice Cline, stu
dent representative. Several meet
ings will be held this spring in order
to complete the arrangements.
