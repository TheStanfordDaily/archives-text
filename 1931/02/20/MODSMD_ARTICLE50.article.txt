# FROSH PLAY BALL WITH POLYTECHNIC TOMORROW AT TEN
## 
### 
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning is j
the time set for the opening play i
in the Stanford Freshmen-Polytech
nic High diamond clash.
Anderson will probably start in j
the box for the babes if his arm is
in good condition. Dodge will as
sume the catching duties but the j
rest of the lineup is indefinite. Ba- I
con has been sick the latter part
of the week and if he is out Satur- i
day, Sutrow will probably start at i
third, with Holmes on second, Rob
inson at short, and Hern at first. I
Goldman looks a sure starter for
left field, with Dick Miles in center, j
Left field is an uncertain position.
At present Coach Cuddeback is j
experimenting in an effort to find J
his most effective slugging com- '
bination. Once a steady lineup is |
decided on, the Babes will make a
big jump in progress toward a well
rounded outfit.
