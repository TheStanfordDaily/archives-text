## Redshirt Quartet Conceded Even Break In Arizona Tilts On Week-end 
### Lowell Cox 
By Lowell Cox

With the unofficial intercollegiate
polo championship of the West as
the stake, Stanford's hard-riding
malelt-wielders will meet the crack
University of Arizona quartet in a
two-game series this week-end.
The ball will be tossed in at 1
o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the
first game, and at 2:30 o'clock for
the final contest on Monday.
Since the games will be played at
handicap, the Redshii'ts will have at
least an even chance of victory. Ari
■ zona, with a rating of 10 goals, will
allow Stanford 4 or 5 goals, the
exact number to be agreed upon
after the visitors arrive on the Sun
j set Limited tomorrow morning.
Stanford has a rating of four goals,
but as both games will be limited to
six chukkers, the full difference
probably will not be allowed. It is
not possible to play the regular eight
periods, the farm stables having to
mount both teams.
Arizona Undefeated
Arizona is bringing north the
I strongest collegiate quartet yet to
invade the campus. Undefeated in
their last 15 games, they are con
sidered the best college poloists in
the southwest.
A recent issue of "Polo" spoke
highly of the Wildcat four, recom
mending that eastern teams en route
to California for the winter season
stop in Tucson for a workout with
| them.
The visitors will find plenty of
competition in the Redshirts, how
i ever, themselves undefeated. Led
by Captain Jack McDougal, this sea
| son's four is the strongest ever
turned out on the Farm by Captain
I R. A. Goxdan, and is conceded to be
the best collegiate team on the coast.
Lineup Announced
Gordan will play the same combi
nation against the Presidio of San
! Francisco quartet, with Spalding at
! No. 1, Gorham at No. 2, Captain Mc-
Dougal at No. 3 and Flemming at
No. 4.
Brown is the star of "the Wildcats,
playing the key No. 3 position, as
does McDougal. Brown has a four
■ goal handicap.
It is expected that all field glasses
1 will be trained on this pair as they
1 vie for honors tomorrow and Mon
! day.

The highway field is in good shape
for the game, although a trifle soft,
while the ponies arc all in excellent
condition, and fast games may be
expected.
Captain Charles Cramer of the
Presidio of San Francisco will ref
eree both contests.
