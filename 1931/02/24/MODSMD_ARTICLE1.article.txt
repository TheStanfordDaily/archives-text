# BEARS DEFEAT CARD HOOPMEN IN FINAL GAME
## Stanford Team Gives Pool Showing Against Strong California Quintet U.C.L.A. DEFEATS U.S.C. Moffatt Is Stanford Star; Fawcett Ruled Out 
### Stewart Crawford 
As the final gun sounded in the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday night
ending a basketball contest which
found Stanford on the disappoint
ing end of a 4(5 to 32 count, the cur
tain fell on Indian court activities
for 1931 simultaneously with Cardi
nal hopes for the first series win
from a Blue and Gold quintet in a
decade.
Since the U.C.L.A. five dropped a
game on the same evening to the
Trojans, the Bear victory cinched the
southern half title for Nibs Price's
men, earning them the right to meet
Washington in the playoff for the
Coast Conference crown at Seattle
next month.
Indians In Cellar
As a result of the loss, the Indians
have a clear claim on the cellar posi
tion of the southern half competition
with three wins and six defeats.
As to the game itself, from the
starting whistle the 7500 fans who
jammed the auditorium expecting to
witness the Indian threaten the title
chances of the Golden Bear watched
the Stanford five struggle helplessly
against a Berkeley attack that was
as smooth as it was deadly.
Seeming never to miss the hoop,
Kintana and Read time and again
broke through the center of the Red
shirt defense to sink field goals from
near the foul line.
Passing Bad
Unable to stop the deluge of
buckets, the Indians also were sadly
deficient in passing, and on numerous
occasions their offense failed to near
its goal as pass after pass was broken
up by the Bears or ended up out of
bounds. »
Except when the count was at two
all after Phil Moffatt had matched
Vendt's opening bucket, the Blue
and Gold five was never headed.
Half way through the first period,
the score stood at 13-12 for a brief
moment until Kintana dropped an
other and the Bears were away again.
Stanford Weakens
Any remaining chance of Bunn's
men in the second half was blasted
when Fawcett was forced out of the
game on fouls soon after the period
had begun. From this point on, it
seemed that the Stanford five was
completely demoralized, and the
score mounted to 40-24.
With the injection of Doub into
the fray, the Indian defense tightened
noticeably, and Moffatt and Reggie
Meade began to find the basket to
close the gap considerably before the
final gun.
Kintana Leads
Kintana, with 14 points, led the
scoring for the evening, while his
teammate, Read, was close on his
heels with 12. Meade gathered 12
markers to lead the Stanford scorers.
Moffatt was easily the star for the
Cardinals, working well on both of
fense and defense. His passing and
floorwork were up to standard, as
well as his shooting, which ac
counted for seven points.

Seeming never to miss the hoop,
Kintana and Read time and again
broke through the center of the Red
shirt defense to sink field goals from
near the foul line.
Passing Bad
Unable to stop the deluge of
buckets, the Indians also were sadly
deficient in passing, and on numerous
occasions their offense failed to near
its goal as pass after pass was broken
up by the Bears or ended up out of
bounds. »
Except when the count was at two
all after Phil Moffatt had matched
Vendt's opening bucket, the Blue
and Gold five was never headed.
Half way through the first period,
the score stood at 13-12 for a brief
moment until Kintana dropped an
other and the Bears were away again.
Stanford Weakens
Any remaining chance of Bunn's
men in the second half was blasted
when Fawcett was forced out of the
game on fouls soon after the period
had begun. From this point on, it
seemed that the Stanford five was
completely demoralized, and the
score mounted to 40-24.
With the injection of Doub into
the fray, the Indian defense tightened
noticeably, and Moffatt and Reggie
Meade began to find the basket to
close the gap considerably before the
final gun.
Kintana Leads
Kintana, with 14 points, led the
scoring for the evening, while his
teammate, Read, was close on his
heels with 12. Meade gathered 12
markers to lead the Stanford scorers.
Moffatt was easily the star for the
Cardinals, working well on both of
fense and defense. His passing and
floorwork were up to standard, as
well as his shooting, which ac
counted for seven points.
As the final gun sounded in the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday night
ending a basketball contest which
found Stanford on the disappoint
ing end of a 4(5 to 32 count, the cur
tain fell on Indian court activities
for 1931 simultaneously with Cardi
nal hopes for the first series win
from a Blue and Gold quintet in a
decade.
Since the U.C.L.A. five dropped a
game on the same evening to the
Trojans, the Bear victory cinched the
southern half title for Nibs Price's
men, earning them the right to meet
Washington in the playoff for the
Coast Conference crown at Seattle
next month.
Indians In Cellar
As a result of the loss, the Indians
have a clear claim on the cellar posi
tion of the southern half competition
with three wins and six defeats.
As to the game itself, from the
starting whistle the 7500 fans who
jammed the auditorium expecting to
witness the Indian threaten the title
chances of the Golden Bear watched
the Stanford five struggle helplessly
against a Berkeley attack that was
as smooth as it was deadly.

Kintana and Read time and again
broke through the center of the Red
