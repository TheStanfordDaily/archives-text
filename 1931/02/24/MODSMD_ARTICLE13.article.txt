# RIOTS EXPECTED IN CHICAGO VOTE
## 70,000 Guards Marshalled To Protect Polls 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 23. (£>)— An army
of approximately 70,000 today made
to maintain order in tomorrow's
mayoralty and aldermanic pri
maries, with reports already before
them of pre-election violence.

A final burst of raucous cam
paigning tonight ended Chicago's
most bizarre mayoralty primary
contest with William Hale Thomp
son's political future as the issue.

Mayor Thompson and his two
principal rivals for the Republican
nomination, Alderman Arthur F.
Albert and Judge John H. Lyle,
carried their final pleas to the
voters up to the small hours of
election morning, while the army of
seventy thousand men was mobil
ized to see that the enthusiasm they
aroused did not become violent at
the polls tomorrow.
Judge Frank M. Padden ordered
an intensive search for A1 Capone,
gang leader, who is reported to have
returned from his Miami home to
prevent any possible interference on
the gangster's part in the election.
Squads headed by Patrick Roche,
chief investigator for the state's at
torney, toured the county under
orders to bring Capone in on a va
grancy warrant sworn out months
ago by Judge Lyle.
