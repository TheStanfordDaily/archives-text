# POLO VICTORIES GO TO ARIZONA IN TWO GAMES
## Redshirts Offer Visitors Keen Competition In Brilliant Play 
### Lowell Cox 
Displaying the most brilliant polo
j ever seen on the Stanford field, the
1 University of Arizona quartet yes
! terday won the second and deciding
j game of their series with the Red-
I shirts, a last-minute goal giving
I them a 10 to 9 victory.
After allowing the Stanford four
i a five-goal handicap, the Wildcats
I rode to an 11 to 9 win on Saturday,
| Rnd repeated yesterday to take the
j series that is generally conceded to
j have been for the intercollegiate
j polo championship of the Far West.
Both Games Close
Led by Captain Jack McDpugall,
| the Redshirts forced the invaders
i throughout both games, and it was
I not until the final chukker that
either was decided.
Stanford led, 9 to 8, at the start
of the closing period Saturday,
when the Arizonans unleashed a
three-goal attack that decided the
| issue.
In yesterday's game the invaders
j started strong, scoring four goals in
I the first chukker and two more in
I the second, while the Indian riders
could account for but one.
Tied Score at Half
The third period saw the Red
; shirts find their stride, both teams
| tallying three times, tying the net
! score at 9 to 9 at half time.
Only one goal was scored in the
entire second half, the most thrilling
! periods of the matches. Although
both quartets threatened many
i times, it appeared that an extra
i chukker would be necessary, when
| Dritt hammered his sixth tally of
j the day through the goal posts just
! before the final bell tolled.
McDougall Stars
Captain McDougall, who scored
three goals Saturday and one yes
j terday, was the star of the series
I for Stanford. He played brilliantly
i throughout both matches, and with
! a little more support might have
j turned the tide of victory.
Fleming played well yesterday,
: accounting for two goals, after a
! poor day Saturday, while Gorham
• and Spalding both looked good
i against their more experienced cp
| ponents.
Dritt at No. 2 and Brown at No. 3
! led the Arizona attack, the former
; accounting for 10 goals during the
| series, while the latter was the key
' man around whom their offense
: was built.
Stick-work Is Superior
The superior stick-work of the
invaders was probably the biggest
i factor in the Wildcat victories.
