# German Students Less Naive Than Americans
## 
### BEATRICE BISHOP 
The American student is much
more open-minded and naive than
the German student, in the opinion
of Professor Kurt F. Reinhardt, of
the Department of Germanic Lan
guages.
"He has no preconceived opinion,"
says Professor Reinhardt, "and he
enters the university with an open
mind. The German student comes
to the university with a stereotyped
mentality and a sort of sophistica
tion. It is much more difficult to
deal with the German student than
the American student on that ac
count.
German Originality
"Students in Germany are more
individualistic in their attitude. The
idea of originality is inherent, and
often goes to the extreme. It is
traceable throughout German his
tory, and accounts for the large num
ber of political parties at the present
time. The more the German de
velops his originality, the more he
is respected. The American student
thinks he should be one among many
—that he should not differ.
"The whole system of education
is directed toward the development
of self-responsibility in the student.

After thirteen years of school, the
student enters the university, where
he stays for a minimum of three or j
four years, during which time no
examinations are taken.
One Oral Examination
"When the student thinks he has
fulfilled his requirements, he writes
his doctor's thesis and takes an oral j
examination. The only degree given I
is the doctor's degree. The student
does not work for the teacher, j
Everything he does is for himself and
the formation of his own life.
'"The German student is much
more burdened and tortured by
problems than the American stu
dent. He thinks he has to be a re
former and that he has a special mis- ,
'sion.
"I think the American women stu- i
dents are more active and diligent
than the men," Professor Reinhardt
said. "I account for this by the fact
that the boys usually have to begin <
to work at an early age.
"The very fact that we have had
to invent a new word—'werk student' j
—shows that the German student, is
expected to devote all his time to
his studies, and not work to support ;
