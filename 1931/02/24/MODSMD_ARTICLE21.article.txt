# Swain Approves Two Suggestions Of Ex Committee On Code
## Signed Pledge To Be Required of All Students Taking Examinations; Purpose of Honor Code To Be Posted in Classrooms 
### 
JWO recommendations by the Executive Committee that would tend to
a more stringent enforcement of the Honor Code were unqualifiedly
approved by Acting-President Robert E. Swain yesterday, and will be put
into effect, it was indicated, by the coming final examinations. The
Executive Committee's recommendations were as follows:
(1) That the faculty be instructed to require the following signed pledge
on all written work intended to be done independently and to be used
as a basis for grades: "No unpermitted aid given or received."

> No work is to be accepted by a
faculty member until this pledge,
signed by the student, has been
written on the front cover of the
blue book, the front page of the
quiz paper, or on the outside cover
of the report.
List of Failures
The Executive Committee also
recommended that where possible, a
list of the students who had neglect
ed to write the pledge be posted in
the classroom or announced by the
faculty man the day after the work
was turned in, so that those who
merely forgot to write the pledge
could be given an opportunity to do
so.
When this procedure would not
be possible, as after finals, when
students have left and do not return
to class, it was recommended that
the paper not be graded and that
the student be forced to accept the
consequences of his carelessness, if
carelessness it should be.
Such a system has been in use
for a number of years at the Uni
versity of Virginia where the sign
ing of a similar pledge has been re
quired, and has met with unusual
success.

into effect, it was indicated, by the coming final examinations. The
Executive Committee's recommendations were as follows:
(1) That the faculty be instructed to require the following signed pledge
on all written work intended to be done independently and to be used
as a basis for grades: "No unpermitted aid given or received."

> No work is to be accepted by a
faculty member until this pledge,
signed by the student, has been
written on the front cover of the
blue book, the front page of the
quiz paper, or on the outside cover
of the report.
List of Failures
The Executive Committee also
recommended that where possible, a
list of the students who had neglect
ed to write the pledge be posted in
the classroom or announced by the
faculty man the day after the work
was turned in, so that those who
merely forgot to write the pledge
could be given an opportunity to do
so.
When this procedure would not
be possible, as after finals, when
students have left and do not return
to class, it was recommended that
the paper not be graded and that
the student be forced to accept the
consequences of his carelessness, if
carelessness it should be.
Such a system has been in use
for a number of years at the Uni
versity of Virginia where the sign
ing of a similar pledge has been re
quired, and has met with unusual
success.
Print Notice
The second recommendation of
the Executive Committee approved
by Dr. Swain was to the effect that
the following notice be printed in
placard form and posted in all
classrooms.
"The Honor Code is an undertak
ing of the students, individually and
collectively, that they will not give
or receive aid in examinations; that
they will not give or receive unper
mitted aid in classwork, in the pre
parations of reports, or in any other
work that is to be used by the
instructor as the basis of grading.
"That they will not violate the
rules of the library by taking with
out permission from the library, or
by injuring any book, pamphlet, or
other document belonging to its col
lection; and that they will do their
share, and take an active part, in
seeing to it that others as well as
Ihemselves obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code.
"The University on its part mani
fests its confidence in the honor of
its students by refraining from
prottoring examinations, or other
wise taking special steps to prevent
the forms of dishonesty mentioned
above."
JWO recommendations by the Executive Committee that would tend to
a more stringent enforcement of the Honor Code were unqualifiedly
approved by Acting-President Robert E. Swain yesterday, and will be put
into effect, it was indicated, by the coming final examinations. The
Executive Committee's recommendations were as follows:
(1) That the faculty be instructed to require the following signed pledge
