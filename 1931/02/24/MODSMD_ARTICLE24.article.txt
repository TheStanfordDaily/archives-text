Transfer or rooters' tickets during

and the B.A.C. budget for the en
suing year.
Budget Approved
A budget of $458,612.50, to cover
the period from September 1, 1931,
to August 31, 1932, has been given
the official B.A.C. sanction.
The B.A.C. ticket committee, at
its last meeting, made the following
recommendations, which were ap
proved by the board and released
yesterday:
The "Out-of-State" rule, whereby
alumni living outside the state of
California had to call personally for
tickets at the Stadium the day of
the game, has been abolished. These
tickets will now be mailed.
Alumni Favored
The "Husband and Wife" rule,
whereby only one could apply when
both husband and wife were alumni,
has also been abolished. Both may
now apply if they are eligible under
the other rules.
The "Personal Use of Alumni
Tickets" rule has been modified so
that the alumnus no longer need
use one of his tickets himself, pro
viding a member of his immediate
family—mother, father, brother, sis
ter, son, daughter, wife, husband, or
legal guardian—uses it.
Alumni have been classified in two
groups—paid members of the Alumni

one year in the University, and non
paid alumni and those alumni who
have spent less than one year in the
University.

Applying directly to students, the
provision has been made that the
two tickets allotted students in addi
tion to their rooter's ticket must be
used by the immediate family, ex
cept where a student himself accom
panies the holder of the other ticket.
In the event that a student accom
panies the holder of the other ticket,
he will not be allowed the use of his
rooter's ticket, and blacklisting will
be the penalty.
Paid members of the Alumni As
sociation and all students will be
grouped together in one classifica
tion.

Budget Approved
A budget of $458,612.50, to cover
the period from September 1, 1931,
to August 31, 1932, has been given
the official B.A.C. sanction.
The B.A.C. ticket committee, at
its last meeting, made the following
recommendations, which were ap
proved by the board and released
yesterday:
The "Out-of-State" rule, whereby
alumni living outside the state of
California had to call personally for
tickets at the Stadium the day of
the game, has been abolished. These
tickets will now be mailed.
Alumni Favored
The "Husband and Wife" rule,
whereby only one could apply when
both husband and wife were alumni,
has also been abolished. Both may
now apply if they are eligible under
the other rules.
The "Personal Use of Alumni
Tickets" rule has been modified so
that the alumnus no longer need
use one of his tickets himself, pro
viding a member of his immediate
family—mother, father, brother, sis
ter, son, daughter, wife, husband, or
legal guardian—uses it.
Alumni have been classified in two
groups—paid members of the Alumni
Association who have spent at least
one year in the University, and non
paid alumni and those alumni who
have spent less than one year in the
University.
Laws for Ticket Use
Applying directly to students, the
provision has been made that the
two tickets allotted students in addi
tion to their rooter's ticket must be
used by the immediate family, ex
cept where a student himself accom
panies the holder of the other ticket.
In the event that a student accom
panies the holder of the other ticket,
he will not be allowed the use of his
rooter's ticket, and blacklisting will
be the penalty.
