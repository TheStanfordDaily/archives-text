# ANOTHER JOB FOR THE EX COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Willi the approval yesterday by Hie Administration of
Executive (Committee recommendations concerning the
Honor (lode, additional assurance was given that the ('ode
will be enforced. The Executive Committee, control body
of the Associated Students, is seriously endeavoring to
bring about a more general observance of the Honor Code.
The President's Ofliee is backing them up in this endeavor.

Recommendations of the Executive Committee were as
follows: (I) That the faculty be instructed to require the
following signed pledge on all written work intended to bo
done independently and to be used as a basis for grades:
No unpermitted aid given or received. (2) That an ex
planation of the Honor Code and a statement of what kind
of conduct is expected from the students be printed and
placed in the classrooms.
Object of liie Executive Committee action is to deter (he
unconscious violators of the Honor Code from so doing. At
Stanford (here are three groups of students: (1) The great
majority of students who would never consider breaking
the Code, (2) the relatively small number who, during the
strain of taking an examination or of preparing a long
overdue paper, might violate (he Code without directly
realizing that their action was dishonest, and (.*>) the very
few who are malicious cheaters, intentionally breaking the
Code.
II is in Ibis second group that the Executive Committee
is interested, and it is lor Ihe purpose of making these stu
dents realize what (lie Code is that the signed pledge and
posted placard proposals have been made. The action of
these students in unconsciously violating the Code is just as
much cheating as thai of the students who do so deliber
ately. and it is essential that I hey he impressed with Ibis
fact.
As for I lie third group the malicious cheaters, the
Executive Committee can do nothing about them. They are
students who don't belong at Stanford, and the sooner their
conduct brings them before the Men's and Women's Coun
cils and results in their dismissal from the I'niversity the
better will be the campus for the many who live up to all
the* provisions of the Honor Code.
The Executive Committee- recommendations should lead
to a clearer understanding of what the Honor Code is and
to a stricter observance of il by all the students.
There is still, however, a point on which the Executive
Committee can act in regard to the Honor Code. It can
authorize the publication of the names of all convicted vio
'ators of the Code. Those students who cheat and other
wise fail to plav square with their classmates deserve not
only to be expelled from the I'niversity but likewise lo have
everyone know the kind of individuals they are.

placed in the classrooms.
Object of liie Executive Committee action is to deter (he
unconscious violators of the Honor Code from so doing. At
Stanford (here are three groups of students: (1) The great
majority of students who would never consider breaking
the Code, (2) the relatively small number who, during the
strain of taking an examination or of preparing a long
overdue paper, might violate (he Code without directly
realizing that their action was dishonest, and (.*>) the very
few who are malicious cheaters, intentionally breaking the
Code.
II is in Ibis second group that the Executive Committee
is interested, and it is lor Ihe purpose of making these stu
dents realize what (lie Code is that the signed pledge and
posted placard proposals have been made. The action of
these students in unconsciously violating the Code is just as
much cheating as thai of the students who do so deliber
ately. and it is essential that I hey he impressed with Ibis
fact.
As for I lie third group the malicious cheaters, the
Executive Committee can do nothing about them. They are
students who don't belong at Stanford, and the sooner their
conduct brings them before the Men's and Women's Coun
cils and results in their dismissal from the I'niversity the
better will be the campus for the many who live up to all
the* provisions of the Honor Code.
The Executive Committee- recommendations should lead
to a clearer understanding of what the Honor Code is and
to a stricter observance of il by all the students.
There is still, however, a point on which the Executive
Committee can act in regard to the Honor Code. It can
authorize the publication of the names of all convicted vio
'ators of the Code. Those students who cheat and other
wise fail to plav square with their classmates deserve not
only to be expelled from the I'niversity but likewise lo have
everyone know the kind of individuals they are.
