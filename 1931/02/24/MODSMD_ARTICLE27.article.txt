Acting-President Hubert K. Swain has stepped in and
registered an ollieial veto, and so the Stanford Monthly,
proposed literary publication iliat was to have been issued
for the first time in March, lias died a-borning.
Dr. Swain's action in refusing to sanction the publication
of the magazine on the campus, after the Kxeeutive Com
mittee had approved if, may seem a summary one, but,
viewed in the light of the reasons the acting president ad
vanced for vetoing the project, it seems quite logical.
For one thing, Swain pointed out, the financial status of
the magazine was doubtful, a fact that caused Stan Milne,
student manager, to withhold his sanction. If the campus
would not support the magazine, the responsibility would
fall upon the Associated Students, a burden Swain feels
they should not assume.
Secondly, the editorial future of the magazine was un
certain, the acting president held, (iunnar Xorberg, who
was to take over the editor's duties, is to be graduated in
June, and there is at present no one in sight to replace him.
In the third place, Dr. Swain did not approve of the an
nounced policy of the magazine to use numerous articles
by outside contributors on controversial subjects. Although
he believes student opinion should be virtually unrestricted,
he declared that the proposed arrangement offered a splen
did opportunity for the dissemination of various forms of
propaganda by off-campus writers, using the Stanford
name.
If a new Stanford monthly magazine is to be established,
it needs a good healthy start, and a fair assurance of its
immediate future. Without that, the project should not be
attempted.
