## NEEDS ENLIGHTENMENT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The letter which appeared in The
Daily on last Thursday under the
title ''All American Destructive" is
Ihc first statement by an American
that I have seen in The Daily that
gets anywhere beyond shallow
treatment of this military training
matter. That letter was clearly and
effectively written . . .
I have a question or two in mind
and I am writing you in the hope
of hearing from some of your read
ers who can throw light on these
matters. Tell me, what is the status
of military training here? Why was
it kept on after the war? My own
undergraduate institution refused to
continue it after the war period.
Their policy determining group did
not favor continuance, I believe,.
Also, the institution has relatively
sufficient means of support!
Is the basic reason for continuance
here the fact that Stanford is
"broke"? Do the trustees determine
financial and educational policies
here? And does the "control" group
back of this institution, whosoever
it may be, feel possibly that the $30
per month that they are able to di
vert from the national tax budget
via the War Department budget lor
every man who takes military train
ing is an essential item in the Uni
versity budget?
That "control" group may be Vnlli
taristic. Or it may feel that "Stan
ford - might - as - well - get -
hers - as - long - as - Cal - does -
etc." It may be misguided. Which?
. . . It is not surprising that our for
eign students who look at us as a
whole nation, rather than as indi
vidual units, think we are talking
peace and at the same time are
training more reserve soldiers at

greater governmental cost than we
have ever done before in the history
of the country, and that we are
therefore hypocrites. Are we? . . .
Or dupes? . . .
Multiply the number of students
who take military training by the
rate the war department pays per
individual trained per month and
then multiply thai by twelve and
you will get some idea of the finan
cial argument the control group
faces annually. Actually how much
does this institution get paid for
training soldiers? Exactly how much
all told? Per man? Is it more or
less than the $30 sum mentioned?
That is the sum which one insti
tution I have heard about from
pretty reliable sources agreed on as
their price for opening up their
human resources to militarism. Are
"institutions" sold out by their con
trolling groups? ... If so, "que
faire?" Anything?
With the tradition of Jordan be
hind Stanford, a relative stranger to
Stanford like myself would expect
to hear that Stanford is in the
"blind" or misguided group. And
yet, with such unusually intelligent
leadership in evidence on all sides,
one can not swallow that explana
tion without difficulty. What is the
reasoning? . . . Dollars do talk
sometimes in strange and unex
pected places.
And our militarists are beguiling,
experienced propagandists. Horses,
polo, summer camping—"A vacation
on pay," outdoor games with guns,
indoor ones in handy galleries, color,
pomp, feminine sponsors, and even
khaki clothes —make excellent bait
for students. . . . But wherein lies
the bait offered and accepted by the
ultimate control group here?

training soldiers? Exactly how much
all told? Per man? Is it more or
less than the $30 sum mentioned?
That is the sum which one insti
tution I have heard about from
pretty reliable sources agreed on as
their price for opening up their
human resources to militarism. Are
"institutions" sold out by their con
trolling groups? ... If so, "que
faire?" Anything?
With the tradition of Jordan be
hind Stanford, a relative stranger to
Stanford like myself would expect
to hear that Stanford is in the
"blind" or misguided group. And
yet, with such unusually intelligent
leadership in evidence on all sides,
one can not swallow that explana
tion without difficulty. What is the
reasoning? . . . Dollars do talk
sometimes in strange and unex
pected places.
And our militarists are beguiling,
experienced propagandists. Horses,
polo, summer camping—"A vacation
on pay," outdoor games with guns,
indoor ones in handy galleries, color,
pomp, feminine sponsors, and even
khaki clothes —make excellent bait
for students. . . . But wherein lies
the bait offered and accepted by the
ultimate control group here?

The Editor, Sir:
The letter which appeared in The
Daily on last Thursday under the
title ''All American Destructive" is
Ihc first statement by an American
that I have seen in The Daily that
gets anywhere beyond shallow
treatment of this military training
matter. That letter was clearly and
effectively written . . .
I have a question or two in mind
and I am writing you in the hope
of hearing from some of your read
ers who can throw light on these
matters. Tell me, what is the status
of military training here? Why was
it kept on after the war? My own
undergraduate institution refused to
continue it after the war period.
Their policy determining group did
not favor continuance, I believe,.
Also, the institution has relatively
sufficient means of support!
Is the basic reason for continuance
here the fact that Stanford is
"broke"? Do the trustees determine
financial and educational policies
here? And does the "control" group
back of this institution, whosoever
it may be, feel possibly that the $30
per month that they are able to di
vert from the national tax budget
via the War Department budget lor
every man who takes military train
ing is an essential item in the Uni
versity budget?
That "control" group may be Vnlli
taristic. Or it may feel that "Stan
ford - might - as - well - get -
hers - as - long - as - Cal - does -
etc." It may be misguided. Which?
. . . It is not surprising that our for
eign students who look at us as a
whole nation, rather than as indi
vidual units, think we are talking
peace and at the same time are
training more reserve soldiers at

greater governmental cost than we
have ever done before in the history
of the country, and that we are
therefore hypocrites. Are we? . . .
Or dupes? . . .
Multiply the number of students
who take military training by the
rate the war department pays per
individual trained per month and
then multiply thai by twelve and
you will get some idea of the finan
cial argument the control group
faces annually. Actually how much
does this institution get paid for
training soldiers? Exactly how much
all told? Per man? Is it more or
less than the $30 sum mentioned?
