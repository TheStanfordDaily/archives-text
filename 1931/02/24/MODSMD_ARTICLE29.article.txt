# GIVE GRADE POINTS FOR EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It has long been a question here
at Stanford whether or not an ath
lete, or in general, anyone engaged
in extra-curricular activities should
j receive reward for his painstaking
1 efforts . . . and if so, what should
| be the reward. The writer recog
nizes the fact that a unit is given
the man engaged in a sport, but wo
are told a unit represents credit for
i three hours' work, and for such a
| unit it is not uncommon to see an
• athlete work from ten to twenty
hours a week.
Then the question is brought up
1... do people go to universities for
I such things as. playing football, or
! spending their time at the office of
the campus newspaper . . . and the
! answer to that question is yes, they
do.
What the author is trying to get
at is just this: the Administration
ought to provide recognition, schol
astically, for extra-curricular activi
j ties.
The question will then come up
... what sort of recognition can it
provide? Certainly it would be un

wise to give units for such activi
ties. We have the trying situation
where a student's time is taken
partly from his studies, by these
activities, and the consequent low
ering of his scholastic average. Why
not give grade points in recognition
for these activities? . . .
Thus it would be possible for the
journalist, to whom it is more im
portant to experience the "getting
out" of the paper each night, to
maintain as high an average as the
mathematician who may spend all
his time over the books. Certainly
he gets more out of reading proof
and writing stories and heads than
he would were he to conscientiously
strive for an A in such an irrele
vent course as chemistry.
Consider such a system from a
communal standpoint. To be sure
participation in the various activi
ties would be increased . . . but is
that not desirable? More benefit
would be derived from them be
cause of greater competition, and
too, perhaps the all too prevalent
"racketeering" that goes on in some
of the institutions could be put to
an end. A. M. May.

partly from his studies, by these
activities, and the consequent low
ering of his scholastic average. Why
not give grade points in recognition
for these activities? . . .
Thus it would be possible for the
journalist, to whom it is more im
portant to experience the "getting
out" of the paper each night, to
maintain as high an average as the
mathematician who may spend all
his time over the books. Certainly
he gets more out of reading proof
and writing stories and heads than
he would were he to conscientiously
strive for an A in such an irrele
vent course as chemistry.
Consider such a system from a
communal standpoint. To be sure
participation in the various activi
ties would be increased . . . but is
that not desirable? More benefit
would be derived from them be
cause of greater competition, and
too, perhaps the all too prevalent
"racketeering" that goes on in some
of the institutions could be put to
an end. A. M. May.
