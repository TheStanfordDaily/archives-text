THE BROWNINGS, A VICTORIAN
IDYLL. By David Loth. Bretano
Publishers, New York. 1929.
In these uriromantio days of
pseudo-biografchizing '"The Brown
ings" comes as a happy recollection
that once romance really existed.
The almost forgotten Victorian
idyll of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert
Browning sours the wine of realism,
and it is almost maddening to recall
with what success two individuals
of genius and heart dared to be
happy.
It was entirely fitting that Ba's
dying word should be "Beautiful"
and that with his last voice Brown
ing should murmur "How gratify-

The author of this appreciation
deserves credit for something more
than careful writing. The nature of
his subject made the beauty of his
telling a consequence. But for this
Loth deserves praise. He has hu
manized the extraordinary, and that
after all is the ultimate goal of bio
graphy.
Due largely to Browning's excep
tional learning and the now perished
passion of small minds for culture,
Browning has been shoved to the
top shelf for reputed obscurity. The
present generation has neither the
fairness nor the curiosity nor the
scholarship to verify the tradition.

THE BACHELOR FATHER. At the
New Stanford Theatre.
Built on a preposterous situation,
amusing in itself—that of a bache
lor gathering his offspring around

' him—"The Bachelor Father" is a
good comedy with a melodramatic
ending.
Marion Davics as "Tony," who
turns out to be an unwitting im
poster, has evsry chance to cavort
before the screen in the language
tinged of the East Side, and win the
hearts of the elderly bachelor and
the young lawyer.
Why somebody had to introduce
a transatlantic flight to attain the
ending remains incomprehensible,
unless it was intended to provide
tense excitement. —J. N.
PAINTED DESERT—At the Varsity
Theatre.
For engineer.? and children only.
We mean that there are some inter
esting mine construction scenes, and.
some tremendous blasting—a whole
mountain crashes down in fact. This
scene is very noisy but no one is
hurt.
There are also two runaways. The
second one is faintly exciting. Wil
liam Royd as the sterling and virile
young man who ends the twenty
year feud between his two grim
i foster fathers, twice missing death
, by a hairsbreadth, gives a fair per
| formance. The trouble is that
; Johnny Mack Brown did this Eort
lof thing in "Billy The Kid"—and
fhore is no comparison between the
; talents of William Boyd and the
latter star. "Painted Desert" is slow
! —but otherwise innocuous.
