It v.as a very merry Christmas
and a happy birthday, for Washing
ton, maybe; for us it v/as a noisy
week-end, and fraternity rising
bells ring just as early on off-days
as they do the rest of the time.

We watched our little white
brothers from Arizona /gallop
away on Stanford ponies to vic
tory, twice in one week-end.
Polo's a friendly game to watch,
hut not awfully polite, accord
ing to a co-ed spectator, who
objects that nearly all the play
ers remove an awful number of
divots, and they never take
time to replace them at all.
But the local fish did a lot bettea
I against the Oregon Webfooters, :
breaking several records and the 1
| necks of three spectators, in the
high diving events,
If the boxing and- basketball
teams could co-operate a bit,
things might be a lot rosier on
the sport page today. Let Miller
and Rogers skip about and in
, terfere for our star forwards,
[ and the referee's whistle would
n't blow so often for goals at
the mother end of the court.
Now that the hoop season is of- \
| ficially over with, the juniors on j
j the varsity squad have challenged ]
i all soph member's to a tournament, j
Bunglers and murderers always re- I
i turn to the scene of original crime, j
The City of Los Angeles, Incor- !
i porated, is singing the praises of
Leland Stanford Junior. Seems that
| they took an unofficial census rec- :
! ord last Saturday, and found that <
j that population had increased by j
j 2900 victims, during the week. Two
| thousand eight hundred ninety
! seven out-of-town cars were wear- 1
j ing red-and-white stickers. The
three co-eds weren't college-minded.
