A lot of fans are still wander
ing around looking for the ex
planation for what happened up
there in the Oakland Audi
torium Saturday night. The ma
jority probably attribute the
rout at the hands of the Blue
and Gold to some mysterious
factor which completely de
moralized the Indian five. An
easy method of disposing of the
unpleasant question is simply
to acknowledge that Nibs Price
has the better ball club.
However, without attempting to
deny ihe obvious truth of the above
assumption, a lot may be gained
from analyzing the mistakes of the
losing team. First, it is necessary to
account for the decidedly sour ap
pearance of the Cardinal defense.
Almost at will, Reade seemed able
to break through the center of the
Stanford guarding formation un
covered, free either to take a shot
or feed the ball to the Bear for
wards cdming in from the side. It
was Captain Mike Reynolds' job to
plug this vulnerable spot, but Mike
wasn't playing the game that night.
The veteran guard seemed to for
get, in the heat of the battle, that
he had been shifted to the center
position at the beginning of the 1931
court season.
Otherwise, the Indian defense
functioned. Rintala covered his
position well, working hard
every minute of the game. Faw
cclt started the tilt with his
usual high standard of basket
ball til! he had three personals
called on him early in the con
test. That he had to use par
ticular caution to keep from
being put out of the fray un
doubtedly affected his guarding
until he was finally charged
with the fourth foul. Meade and
Moffatt did their share of work,
lighting it up continually out in
the front line of defense.
That something was also wrong
with the attack of the Redshirt
quintet was also apparent to the
spectators, and may be further sub
stantiated by a chart which shows
that Stanford took only 21 shots at
the bucket in the first half, to 40
for California. Both teams tanked
about a fourth of their attempted
field goals in the initial period,
which shows , that the shooting eye
of the invaders was as good as that
of the Bears. Poor passing accounted
for the fact that Bunn's men took
only half as many tries as the Bears.
On numerous occasions they threw
the ball away, either out of bounds
or into the hands of a Berkeleyite.
Had the Indians played up to
standard, no one can deny that
the score would have been a lot
closer, but few would go so far
as to claim that Stanford would
have won. The Bears proved for
the second consecutive time that

each man on their basketball
team is a dead shot, and that
(hose one-armed, left-handed
long shots are not simply- lucky
scores. The prediction hy Coach
John Bunn at the start of the
season that California would
win the southern half confer
ence title lias come true, and
Nihs Price mid his boys de
serve a hand. We wish them
success on their journey to the
North, w here they will meet the
Huskies for the Pacific Coast
crown.
Aside from the basketball disap
pointment. the performances of red
shirted athletes in other sporting
events over the week-end are good
cause for cheer. No less than re
markable are the times turned in
by Eastman and Kables in the in
terclass track meet, when the for
mer negotiated the 440 in 43.4, and
the latter took the hundred in 9.7,
the fastest time yet recorded on the
coast this season. The baseball team
has made an auspicious beginning
by taking the measure of the Bron
cos and St. Mary's. And Coach Ernst
Branclsten's swimmers downed Ore

unpleasant question is simply
to acknowledge that Nibs Price
has the better ball club.
However, without attempting to
deny ihe obvious truth of the above
assumption, a lot may be gained
from analyzing the mistakes of the
losing team. First, it is necessary to
account for the decidedly sour ap
pearance of the Cardinal defense.
Almost at will, Reade seemed able
to break through the center of the
Stanford guarding formation un
covered, free either to take a shot
or feed the ball to the Bear for
wards cdming in from the side. It
was Captain Mike Reynolds' job to
plug this vulnerable spot, but Mike
wasn't playing the game that night.
The veteran guard seemed to for
get, in the heat of the battle, that
he had been shifted to the center
position at the beginning of the 1931
court season.
Otherwise, the Indian defense
functioned. Rintala covered his
position well, working hard
every minute of the game. Faw
cclt started the tilt with his
usual high standard of basket
ball til! he had three personals
called on him early in the con
test. That he had to use par
ticular caution to keep from
being put out of the fray un
doubtedly affected his guarding
until he was finally charged
with the fourth foul. Meade and
Moffatt did their share of work,
lighting it up continually out in
the front line of defense.
That something was also wrong
with the attack of the Redshirt
quintet was also apparent to the
spectators, and may be further sub
stantiated by a chart which shows
that Stanford took only 21 shots at
the bucket in the first half, to 40
for California. Both teams tanked
about a fourth of their attempted
field goals in the initial period,
which shows , that the shooting eye
of the invaders was as good as that
of the Bears. Poor passing accounted
for the fact that Bunn's men took
only half as many tries as the Bears.
On numerous occasions they threw
the ball away, either out of bounds
or into the hands of a Berkeleyite.
Had the Indians played up to
standard, no one can deny that
the score would have been a lot
closer, but few would go so far
as to claim that Stanford would
have won. The Bears proved for
the second consecutive time that

each man on their basketball
team is a dead shot, and that
(hose one-armed, left-handed
long shots are not simply- lucky
scores. The prediction hy Coach
John Bunn at the start of the
season that California would
win the southern half confer
ence title lias come true, and
Nihs Price mid his boys de
serve a hand. We wish them
success on their journey to the
North, w here they will meet the
Huskies for the Pacific Coast
crown.
Aside from the basketball disap
pointment. the performances of red
shirted athletes in other sporting
events over the week-end are good
cause for cheer. No less than re
markable are the times turned in
by Eastman and Kables in the in
terclass track meet, when the for
