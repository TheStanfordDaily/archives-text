# St Mary's, Olympic Club Downed By Cards
## STANFORD TIES SECOND STRAIGHT CONFERENCE TILT Johnson And Milsap Pitch Full Route For Indians In Holiday Games 
### Francis Lloyd 
Two victories—St. Mary's and the
' | Olympic Club—two nine-inning
' pitchers—Dan Johnson and Frank
■ Milsap—the season's first homer in
! the new park—in this fashion the
■ Stanford varsity nine celebrated, in j
fitting manner, the week-end of !
> ' Washington's birthday on the Farm.
' : Collecting their second conference
■ win within the week, the Indians
defeated a strong team from St.
Mary's by a 4-2 margin last Satur
day. With a waik and a man hit by
the pitcher, Dan Johnson advanced
bcth around the bases with a pcr
| fectly laid bunt. Dykes Johnson
1 then smacked a hard grounder to
second, who fumbled the ball, scor- |
I two men for Stanford in the j
| third.
Campbell Triples
Campbell opened the fifth with a ;
triple to left field, and was brought ;
j home by a squeeze play when Art j
j Miller made a perfect sacrifice bunt.
Alter getting a v/alk Campbell was
advanced to third and then scored
on Dan Johnson's hard single over
! second to cinch the game for the
i Indians with four runs.
Both starting pitchers for Sian- j
ford lasted the full route, Johnson j
allowing the Gaels four hits and j
1 two runs, and Milsap cutting the j
; Winged-O down with four hits to |
win 12-5. Dan Johnson chalked up i
1 six strike-outs against St. Mary's,
while Frank Milsap made seven
i Clubmen swing at the third strike.
First Homer
Both Burt Deimas and Ike Liver- !
more batted • 1.000 per cent in the
Olympic Ciub game, collecting seven
i j of the Indians' 16 hits in yesterday's
1 : game. With a tremendous drive over !
: j the center fielder's head, the ball
i rolling up the bank in the angle of
the fence in center, Ike Livermore, '
' Stanford catcher, made the first ;
home run in the new baseball field. I
The most sensational play of the 1
week-end festivities came with two
! men out in the ninth, St. Mary's at
bat. Noonan, the Gael's great pitch
ier, hit a hij/h fly between short ;.nd
left field. Hunken and Deimas both J
went after the ball, the latter get- !
; ting the ball in his glove just as
Hunken bumped him. The classic
apple popped out of the glove, but
i Captain Hunken saved the day by
I grabbing the ball before it touched
J the ground..
