# CARD FIGHTERS WIN FIRST TILT FROM U.C. MEN
## Four K.O.'s in Seven Bouts; Final Bear Meet Set For March 5 
### 
On a card of seven thrilling and
hectic bouts, four of which ended
in knockouts, Coach Harry Ma
loney's varsity boxers came through
with four victories last Friday night
to win the first tournament of the
annual competition with California.
After Yuji Imai had lost feather
weight honors of the evening to
James MacMillan, who rocked his
Indian opponent time and again
during the three rounds with a ter
rific right, Fred Glover came back
for Stanford to K.O. Dagdigian, Bear
bantam, in the third frame.
After a fairly even first round,
Glover's slashing right and left
hooks and uppereuts landed with
disconcerting regularity, and Dag
digian was not even able to cover
in the third, when Referee Percy
Locey "-topped the battle.
Vance Rogers continued the In
dian winning streak by taking a
hard-earned extra-round decision
from the Bear lightweight, Earl
Stevens, in the best boxing exhibi
tion of the program. Dick Miller
then re-enacted the bantam spec
tacle in two rounds, battering Cali
fornia's welter, Kenneth Hargrove,
all over the ring.
Hugh Keenan scored Stanford's
fourth win in the light-heavy tan
gle, getting the decision from John
Walters in three rounds. Nate Magid
had a fairly easy time in knocking
out Jim Bell, fighting in the place
of Captain Fred Johnson of the In
dians, in the middleweight division.
Ben Robinson overwhelmed "Red"
Targhetta of Stanford in the heavy
bout, winning by a knockout in the
first round. Targhetta was unable
to get started against his cleverer
and bigger Bear adversary, who ad
ministered a severe beating while
the affair lasted.
The main bouts were preceded by
three preliminaries which brought
Fred Gist, George Eastman, and M.
C. Johnson of Stanford into action.
The second meeting of the two
teams will be March 5.
