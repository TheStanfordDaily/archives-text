# YEARLING CAGERS DROP 55-19 GAME TO U.C. FRESHMEN
## Indian Morale Collapses As Eiffert Stars For Bear Cubs 
### L.M. C 
; Striking a slump in the first half
and collapsing completely in the
second, the Stanford freshman hoop
sters came out on the short end of
a 55 lo 19 score in Saturday night's
preliminary nightmare at Oakland.
Playing the .same brand of game
which allowed a weak Palo Alto
High School live to trounce them
during a mid-season slump, the
(babes watched Captain Hal Eifert
; and his Cubs run wild nearly from
the opening tip-off.
Stanford managed to keep in 'he
game until near the end of the first
1 period, when the score stood 15-2G
as the Indian babes called time out.
After the rest period the Cubs
took the situation completely in
hand, not allowing Stanford to score
so much as a single field goal for
i the remainder of the game.
! half-time count was 15-37.
Eifert, apparently bothered not at
J all by a broken left wrist which was
j encased in a special steel brace,
rolled up 20 tallies in the first period
alone, seven field goals and six free
! throws.
Even Topping, most reliable play
er on the yearling squad, failed to
j get started, until he was finally
; benched as Coach Bunn sent a
stream of substitutes into the game
to give them a chance to win their
j numerals.
Topping accounted for five points,
Packard for five, and Wright for
; four.

Exportations of American-made
j goods through Laredo, Texas, into
Mexico during November were
l valued at more than $2,000,000.
