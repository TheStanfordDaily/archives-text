college man," will sing here in the

He is the youngest son of a

Paul Robeson "the greatest defen
sive end that ever trod the grid
iron."
In 1923 he played in Eugene
O'Neill's "Emperor Jones," after
successes in various amateur pro
ductions. Following his tremendous
ovation in this production he ap
peared in "All God's Chillun,"
"Porgy," and "Black Boy," written
especially for him.
In 1925 he gave his first vocal
concert in New York. People
shouted and stamped until he had
Riven an hour of encores, and for
his next concert they lined up in a
snowstorm to buy standing-room.
After unusual successes in the
United States and in Europe he
again appeared on the legitimate
stage in 1930 in a production of
Shakespeare's "Othello," and created
a sensation as the Moor, being the
first negro to enact this role since
the days of Ira Aldridge, forty
years ago.

coast-to-coast concert tour in sev
eral years, and will appear here
under the auspices of the A.S.S.U.
