# W.A.A. CURRICULUM TO GIVE BASEBALL FOR NEXT QUARTER
## 
### 
Interclass baseball will be offered
to women as a regular gym course
spring quarter for the first time in
several years. Discontinued four or
five years ago due to lack of inter
est, it should be very popular this
year, according to Gertrude Hawley,
Acting Director of Roble Gymna
sium.
Baseball will count as one of the
regular W.A.A. sports for interclass
competition, and players will be
given the usual number of points.
The W.A.A. Board has 1 yet de
cided whether the soft ball which
was used previously or the new
hard ball will be used.
Baseball classes will be scheduled
for 4 o'clock, the customary time
for competitive sports.
