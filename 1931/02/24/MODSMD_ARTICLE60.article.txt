SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 23. (/P)â€”
Feminization of the male is becom
ing a fact, Dr. Lorine Pruette of
the psychological clinic of New
York, averred here today.

"The present trend," Dr. Pruette
said, "may do away with sex con
sciousness and enable us to lead
happier lives. Statistics show that
millions of dollars are spent annu
ally on cosmetics by men. When it
comes to buying, about 80 per cent
of the money in this country is con
trolled directly or indirectly by
women."
