# OREGON STATE DEBATE TEAMS REPORTED LOST
## Missing Forensic Quartet Due Here Tomorrow For Debates 
### 
What was to have been a conven
tional debate tour of the Oregon
State -forensic squad last night had
become a journey of mystery. Two
men and two women, scheduled to
participate in debates at Stanford
tomorrow, have disappeared.
A week ago the debaters, Alice
Ingalls, Dorothy Druschell, George
Hartley and Gordon Winks, were
scheduled to debate College of the
Pacific. That institution received a
telegram chronicling the crack-up of
the debaters' automobile, and offered
apologies for their inability to make
the engagement.
Fresno Not Advised
On Tuesday night, when Fresno
State College was expecting the
wandering troupe, not a telegram ar
rived. Oregon State authorities have
telegraphed queries throughout Cali
fornia; nothing has been heard of
the missing four.
Last night, Stanford students re
turning from Yosemite reported hav
ing seen two couples answering the
general appearance of the missing
quartet. But Stanfoi'd debating of
ficials have received no word from
the Oregon State group.
To Meet Cardinals Here
If they appear, they will be met by
two Stanford debate teams. The
visiting women will argue the nega
tive of the resolution, "That Gandhi
is a benefit to India," against Alice
Small and Thelma Hogevoll of Stan
ford. The debate is scheduled for
4:15 o'clock tomorrow in the Little
Theater.
Tomorrow evening, the Oregon
State men will take the affirmative
of the question, "Resolved, that the
expansion of chain stores is detri
mental to the best interests of the
American people." The Stanford
team, William Dienstein and Edwin
Gerhardt, will be ready to meet the
visitors at 8 o'clock, in the Little
Theater.
