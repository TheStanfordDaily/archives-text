# PATTY BAKER QUITS HOSPITAL, RETURNS TO SORORITY HOUSE
## 
### 
Patty Baker returned to the Chi
Omega house Sunday afternoon
from the Palo Alto Hospital where
she has been receiving treatment for
infantile paralysis since early last
fall.
Patty is able to walk alone, and
will eat her noon and evening meals
in the sorority dining room. Her
registered nurse, Miss Constance
Martin, from San Francisco, is re
maining with her.
Early in October Miss Baker was
stricken with "polio," sent to Chil
dren's Hospital in San Francisco
where the use of the Drinker res
pirator pulled her safely through
the crisis of the disease, and came
to the Palo Alto Hospital in Novem
ber, where she has been since.
In the spring Patty will go to
Warm Springs, Georgia, to take
treatments at the Roosevelt Warm
Springs Sanitarium. She plans to
register again at the University
next fall.
