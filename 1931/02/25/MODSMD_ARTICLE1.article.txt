Code Enforcement
In connection with the announce
"ment in yesterday's Daily of Actfrig-
President Robert E. Swain's action
in confirming the recommendations
of the Ex Committee concerning
Honor Code enforcement, the fol
lowing statements were obtained last
night from members of Men's Coun
cil:
Guido Caglieri, chairman: "This
plan will undoubtedly be of great
assistance in the enforcement pro
gram. Presenting the essentials of
ihc Code to the student every time
he lakes an examination, it will keep
his mind alert to the Code."
Specgle's Statement
Paul Speegle, secretary: "It's just
a mechanical means of getting some
thing done. It is too early to know
whether it v/ill work or not."
Kenneth Mcßae: "TJie plan was
tried a few years ago, and it was dis
carded. However, it will likely be
of value in enforcement of the Honor
Code at this stage."
Warner Edmonds: "Anything the
Ex Committee does in this connection
will be of value. The plan deserves
to be tried, since it keeps the Code
constantly before the student mind."
Milton Hand could not be reached
last night.
