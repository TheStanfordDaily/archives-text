# "POCKET VETO" FEARED AS END OF SHOALS BILL
## Congress Expected To Pass Veterans' Bill Over President's Veto 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24. (/P) â€”
The Muscle Shoals compromise to
day joined the Veterans' Loan Bill
at the White House to await presi
dential action. The latter will be
vetoed tomorrow or Thursday and
returned to the Capitol where it
faces almost certain enactment over
Hoover's disapproval.
The Muscle Shoals resolution
must make a weary round of gov
ernmental departments and bureaus.
Some doubt has been expressed that
its travels can be completed in time
for return to the White House by
March fourth.
Time Short
If Hoover has not signed it by
noon on that date, the time Con
gress adjourns, it will have been
given a "pocket veto." The Muscle
Shoals bill passed by Congress three
years ago was killed in this way
by President Coolidge.
As approved by Congress, the
measure would provide government
operation of the power plant, pri
vate operation of the nitrate plant
for fertilizer production, government
construction of power transmission
lines, and of a feeder dam on the
Clinch river in Tennessee.
Unemployment Aid
The Chief Executive today re
ceived a telegram from Governor
Miller of Alabama urging him to
approve the bill as an unemploy
ment and farm relief measure.
Shortly after the measure was re
ceived at the White House it was
announced it would be sent to the
War Department, the Power Com
mission, the Budget Bureau, and
possibly the Justice Department for
investigation.
