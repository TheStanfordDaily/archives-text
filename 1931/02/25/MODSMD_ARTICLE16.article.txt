# Romanticism Is German's Soul, Says Reinhardt
## North And South Present Striking Contrasts In Art And Ideals 
### 
Summarizing a description of the
character of German art and civili
zation last night in the Little Theater,
Professor Kurt F. Reinhardt, of the
Department of Germanic Languages,
said, "Romanticism seems to be the
very soul and nature of the German,
while classicism seems to be his
ideal. The Northerner is full of long
ing—longing for the southern beauty
and harmony."

Professor Reinhardt presented a
number of lantern slides to illustrate
the romantic spirit and formlessness
of northern Europe in contrast to
the classical, form-loving traits of
the south.

Showing a number of paintings
he explained the characteristics of
the various artists of Germany,
among them Albrecht Duerer,
Gruenewald, Hans Thoma, Boecklin
and Schongauer. A few slides of the
modern art of Germany, which is
roughly described as "new objective
simplicity," were presented. Artists
of this period are Barlach, Lchm
bouck and Hodler.
Professor Reinhardt gave a brief
survey of ecclesiastical art, picturing
Renaissance, Gothic, Baroque and
Rokoko architecture. "The Cathe
dral of Cologne is an outstanding
example of Gothic architecture," he
said. "Everything is dissolved into
infinite melody and musical quality.
It is typically northern.
"Renaissance art is typically south
ern. Baroque is a combination of
the spiritual tendencies of medieval
art with the enhancement of the
Renaissance. The late Baroque
style is called Rokoko in Germany.
It is more music than architecture."
Characteristic scenes of German
and Austrian castles and village life
were also shown.
