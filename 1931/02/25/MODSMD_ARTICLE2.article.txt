## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24. (fP)â€”
The disabled lumber schooner Mun
leon was taken in tow this after
noon by the Coast Guard Cutter
Tahoo, said radio advices received
here by J. A. Lunny, operating man
ager for the McCormick Steamship
Comoany.

Lunny said he had made arrange
ments for the cutler to take the
propellor-less craft in tow and had
radioed her sister ship, the Hamlin
F. McCormick, to disregard previous
messages to bring the Munleon into
San Francisco.

The lumber schooner, adrift off
Table Bluff on the northern Cali
fornia coast, was made safer with
calming seas by shifting the lumber
cargo and correcting a list.
