# Proctor System Flayed By New Council Member
## 
### JOSEPH ENDERT 
i Retention of the Honor Code,
j complete enforcement of it, and
education of new students to the
ideals it embodiesâ€”these are the
| essentials of securing more nearly
perfect conduct in examinations at
Stanford, Milton Hand, new mem
' ber of Men's Council, declared in
an interview yesterday.
"A proctor system would only
! lead to far more flagrant dishonesty
than we have now," Hand said. "To
be sure, the Honor Code is not
functioning perfectly, and it must
be improved. But replacing it with
| a proctor system is, in my opinion,
' an utterly useless remedy.
"Most freshmen and junior col
lege transfers come here from
j schools where a proctor system has
been in force. They have become
i accustomed to seeing obvious cheat
ing and have an idea that the prac
tice may be continued with im
munity at Stanford.
These people must be educated to
the principles of the Honor Code.
Whether this is done through the
Ex Committee, the Encina sponsors,
or Men's Council, it is, I think, a
I necessity. I believe new students
rather than those who have been

here for some time should be given
this education, because, being un
familiar with the Honor Code, they
are most in need of information
concerning it, and are more im
pressionable than old students.
"More complete student body
support of the Code is essential.
Every student should feel himself
morally bound to report Code vio
lations. In addition, some faculty
members have not reported cases
of which they have had knowledge.
They seemed to feel that they
should give the suspected student
another chance or two, and also that
it would be too much trouble for
them to report violations.
"Those who raise the loudest cry
when a violator is given a light pen
alty and who wail for strict en
forcement would not themselves re
port a violation if they saw it. The
Council alone is unable to obtain
thorough observance of the rules of
honorable conduct. It can impose
severe penalties and dispose of cases
as they come before it, but until
every individual student feels it his
moral duty to comport himself with
honor and to expose those who do
not have this feeling, we cannot
have completely perfect conduct."
