# OREGON STATE DEBATES CARD SQUADS TODAY
## 'Lost Teams' Are Expected To Arrive On Schedule This Forenoon 
### 
CORVALLIS, Oregon, Feb. 24. —
Debaters will be at Palo Alto as
scheduled. They met Fresno last
Wednesday and left for Los Angeles.
They seem to be okeh now.
(Bulletin received from the editor
of the Oregon State Barometer last
night.)
Although at a late hour last night
no word had been received from
the Oregon State forensic squad,
Professor James G. Emerson, Stan
ford debate • coach, was confident
that the debates scheduled for this
afternoon and evening with Stan
ford teams would take place.
Emerson said yesterday: "The
Oregon State debaters are sched
uled to arrive here early tomorrow
forenoon and it has never occurred
to us to doubt that they would put
in their appearance at that time.
The so-called 'break-down' occurred
fully a week ago. Had they found
it impossible to continue their tour,
I am sure they would have tele
graphed or written us to that effect.
I am confident they will be on hand
to appear as scheduled."
William Dienstein and Edwin L.
Gerhardt will take the affirmative
for Stanford against George Hartley
and Gordon Winks of Oregon State
in the Little Theatre at 8 o'clock
on the subject, "Resolved, that the
expansion of the chain stores is
detrimental to the best interests of
the American people."
The Stanford women's affirmative
team is composed of Alice Small
and Thelma Hogevoll, who will de
bate with Alice fngalls and Dorothy
Druschell of the northern college
at 4:15 o'clock in the Little Theatre
on the subject, "Resolved, that
Ghandi is a benefit to India." Carl
F. Bowman will preside at the de
bates.
About the men's subject, Profes
sor Emerson said: "The chain store
has been a popular subject for de
bate throughout the country during
the past year, and particularly in
; the Middle West, where local inde
pendent merchants in the many
! smaller towns regard it as almost a
moral issue. At many of (he debates
feeling ran high and on one or two
occasions near-riots resulted. Large
audiences have attended the debates,
many of which have been non-deci
| sion affairs.
I "Of the decision contests the laur
els have gone to the supporters of
the chain store in about 70 per cent
I of the cases. Indeed, the economic
arguments of the negative are ex
ceedingly difficult to overthrow, and
the Stanford debaters this evening
I have their v/ork cut out for them."
The Oregon State team is on the
longest trip of the year's schedule.
The northern college's teams will
travel 12,371 miles this year to have
i 57 varsity debates and 10 freshman
contests. On this trip 15 debates are
scheduled with California colleges.
The Oregon State team is accom
panied by Paul Knoll, debating in
| structor and coach.
