Clinching first place in league I
by their 30-10 win over the A.T.O.'s, j
Sigma Chi's intramural basketball
team, 1930 school champions, won
their way into the playoffs for this
year's title last night in the Pa- i
vilion.
This victory, (he fifth straight for
Sigma Chi. was won during the sec
ond period, when the A.T.O.'s were
outscored 19 to 4. At half time the j
total was only 11-6 for the Sigma
Chi's, largely due to the work of the i
A.T.O. duo, Stewart and Kelly.
High Point Men
Big .shots for the victors were Bob
Gpldwater and Ed Elliot each of
whom accounted for 11 points, the j
former by being in the right place
al the right time, the latter by means j
of his work under the basket.
Breakers got credit for their fourth
straight victory and again went into ,
a tie with El Capital) for the leader- |
ship of league VII, when the Chi
Psi's failed to show up. El Capitan
meets Breakers for the champion- •
ship of this division on March 7th. \
Southerners Win
The Southerners and El Cuadro j
were the other victors last night. The ;
former quintet. took a wild and
wooly affair from Phi Sigma Kappa !
10-3, while Delta Upsilon forfeited
to El Cuadro. Plenty of fight and i
lots of dribbling won for Tobias, :
small but determined forward of the j
Southerners, the laurels of the first
named contest.
