# STANFORD NINE TO CLASH WITH MORAGA TODAY
## Dan Johnson To Start On Mound For Stanford; Dixon May Play INDIANS HOLD ONE WIN Poor Base Running Is Main Fault This Season 
### 
Playing its third conference tilt,
Stanford's baseball varsity will
journey across the bay to Moraga
to meet the St. Mary's nine at 2:30
o'clock this afternoon. Dan Johnson
of the Indians and Joe Noonan of
the Gaels are slated to start on the
mound for their respective teams.
Unless the Farm baseball talent
can improve in its base-running
maneuvers, the Saints may turn out
to be the proverbial worm that
changed its front and leave Wolter's
men on the short end of the score
today. Last Saturday's game with
the Moragans ended very luckily
for the Redshirts, after poor base
running and even pooi'er coaching
from the baselines resulted in four
put-outs and cut short several po
tential rallies.

Base Running Poor
As it was, the Indians scraped
through with two hits and one
costly Gael error to, win the game,
4-2. Nor is the Stanford-St. Mary's
clash of last week the only contest
in which the Indians have displayed
bad generalship on the bases. In
almost all of the practice games,
first base and third base coaching
has been below par. Added to that,
in times of excitement', several
members of the team troop out from
the dugout to confuse the runner
with still more inconsistent direc
tions.
One of the greatest faults of
Stanford's base-running appears to
be a tendency for the men to forget
how many outs there are and that,
the base ahead is already occupied
by a teammate.
Livermore, Dixon May Play
Owing to their heavy, hitting
against the Olympic Club, Ike Liver
more and Phil Dixon seem to be
the likely starters as catcher and
right fielder, respectively. Should
these two men continue to hit
against conference teams, the prob
lem of who is to fill these positions
will have been solved. Hardy,
Philippi, Dykes Johnson, and Del
mas will make up the infield, with
Hunken and Campbell patrolling the
left and center gardens.
Now that basketball has* left the
limelight, Rudy Rintala may turn
out for his former berth in center
field, Rintala could do much to bol
ster the batting average ''of the
team. Mears, another good batsman,
may leave the cage for the diamond.
Bears Play Broncs j
Baseball fans will also be inter
ested in the outcome of the Cali
fornia-Santa Clara mix for
Edwards Field in .Berkeley today.
Stanford defeated the Missipn outfit
7-0 last week and today's results
may give a line on Bear's
; strength. „•
