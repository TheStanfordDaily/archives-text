# FOR A BETTER YALE
## 
### 
Yale, in common with other universities in the vicinity
of New York City, has long faced the problem of week-end
pilgrimages en masse of its student body to the metropolitan
center. Last week a whimsical solution was offered in an
article in the Yale Xeivs. George Van Santvoord, a former
assistant professor at Yale, wrote to explain a plan offered
by a student's father for solving the Yale problem.
The proposal is to lease New Biltmore hotel as a
university building. Students enrolling under the new plan
in "Biltniore College" will pay $">,OOO a year, for four years
of highly intensive social experience.
"Kach student on entering will have his name placed on
the invitation list of the most exclusive metropolitan host
esses. He will thus be assured of opportunity of meeting
the season's debutantes, and he will be expected to extract
from them and their parents invitations 1(5 the significant
dinners, theatre-parties, dances and houseparties of the
season.
"Students meeting these requirements will be given
credit for mastery in the Science of Society. . . . In—eco
nomics tlit 4 texts used are the daily reports of the Stock
Exchange and the Curb Market, the Wall Street Journal and
Uradstreet. In athletics squash, tennis, golf, polo, bridge
and backgammon [will be taught |. . . .
"But students must learn to talk intimately of the char
acteristics of the notable players, criticize the leading
coaches, and speak convincingly about |other| athletics. . . .
"At the end of the four-year course, the bachelor of arts
degree will be deservedly awarded to each student who has
successfully completed the course, providing the candidate
has arranged to marry (advantageously) immediately fol
lowing the award of the degree."
Indeed, few will question the value of such a plan. It
might relieve economics and other departments of students
whose interests are not largely in the fields of those depart
ments. Il would provide an admirable system whereby
students might receive credit for what is now largely unor
ganized and independent study, with no waste of time in
non-essential courses. And it would be a dandy way of
getting F'i<l of a burdensome $20,000!
