"I wouldn't mind hell week, hut some fellows make me
so blamed mad I could . . . well!"
"Our hunch doesn't care what happens to us . . . we just
stick together through it all."
"It's a lot of foolishness, wastes a 10l of time, and il costs
money."
1 iere are three statements about hell week. The first and
hisl statements express the chief evils of university fra
ternity initiation practices while the second statement tells
the only quality of hell week that is on the credit side of the
ledger.
These statements were made to us today by three differ
ent pledges in three separate fraternities. Consider them.
"Some fellows make me so mad . . ."
The major defect of hell week practices lies in these few
words. Some fellows (as the pledge declared) are respon
sible for the barbaric and inexcusable mistakes of hell week.
Some fellows, without common sense it appears, during hell
week are bound to say something or do something that will
irreparably damage the opinion of the pledges both in con
nection with that man and with the house. During hell
week such fellows break loose from the group leader. Too
many things occur during hell week that lend to break up
the harmony of the fraternity or sorority group.
"We just stick together . . ."
Suffering the hardships of hell week does weld the
pledge group together. Hut, the animosities and breaks
arising between the group and the whole organization are
of such frequency to destroy the beneficial factors of the
system.
The last statement is self-explanatory. The disad
vantages of hell week outweigh its best features. The Dailt/
