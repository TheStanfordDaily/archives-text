# "WINGS OVER EUROPE"
## 
### 
Yesterday Harold Ilelvenston announced that "Wings
Over Europe" would be presented til the Bohemian Club in
San Francisco. This play, unique in having an all-male
cast, is one of the outstanding successes of the Dramatic
Council. That it was given a second campus performance
bv popular demand is a tribute to the work of Ilelvenston
and his cast. The invitation which their splendid work
brings from the Bohemian Club is further recognition of the
caliber of Stanford dramatics.
