The Editor, Sir:
People on this campus seem to be
getting interested in Chinese affairs
and I am glad that they are. This
is ihe way that we come to a more
detailed understanding which is the
basis of international friendship.
Miss Elston's article in the Daily
the other morning refers to many
points I made a few days ago to
which 1 am taking the liberty of
adding something more.
Chinese students at home during
the present era are somewhat over
burdened in the sense that they
have to bear .so much responsibility
other* than their academic work.
Since the May Fourth Movement in
1919 which marked the beginning of
"Student Movement," Chinese stu
dents have ever been active in social
and political enterprises. The first
success that brightened their vision
and encouraged their effort was the
deliverance of Tsintao by their east
ern neighbors, which campaign was
initiated and stuck to by the stu
dents. In the year 1926, thousands
of students participated in the
Northward Expedition and they
fought so bravely against the old
regime that the student associations
are now counted as the people's or
ganizations to be represented in the
People's convention in the coming
May, the object of which convention
is to discuss all important and
fundamental problems of future
China. It might be theoretically
doubtful whether students (who are
supposed to be immature) should
take active pai't in governmental

I work, but experience has shown
that such measure is helpful to
China.
The title of Miss Elston's article
might strike some av/e. Of course
this sounds "terrible." During the
course of revolution, anti-revolu
tionary speeches need naturally be
checked upon, no matter whether
the propagandist is a professor or a
tramp. So far as I am sure, how
ever, there is only one such tragedy
as happened to Professor Tah-Tsao
Lee, who was executed on behalf
of his supposed connection with the
communists. Speech is not so ab
solutely free as is the case ol a
citizen in a peaceful society, but Ihe
life of a person, especially that of a
professor, is something to be care
fully considered. If I am going to
give an example, Professor Hu of
the Peking University expressed his
skeptical view even to the Three
People Principle which is the theo
retical basis of the present Chinese
government. He is getting along as
1 well as anybody else.
China is in a transitional period.
Things are rapidly changing. China
today is quite different from what
I she was in 1926, not to say to go
' any farther back. If we admit that
the whole history of human society
is a record of changes and at the
: same time of steps of improvement,
China is in a stage of long-stride
[ progress. I wish the Chinese stu
dents on this campus to have more
time and chances to make China of
I today better understood.
Very truly yours,
Henry C. Liu.
