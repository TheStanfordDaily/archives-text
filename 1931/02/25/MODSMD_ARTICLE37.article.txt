TOFAZE—At the Curran Theatre,
San Francisco.
It is not difficult to see why this
amusing satire, by Marcel Pagnol,
has a two-year run in Paris and a
year in New York to its credit.
While ''Topaze'' could never be ac
cused of depth, it is novel, clever in
a typically French manner, and
faultlessly constructed.
The not too highly moral plot of
"Topaze" concerns an honest pro
fessor, who loses his job because of
this honesty. He becomes the un
witting tool of two political grafters.
The climax comes when the pro
fessor discovers what he is doing
and in turn outwits his colleague in
graft and appropriates his mistress.
Not very elevating but highly en
tertaining is the result.
The production of the French
comedy is exceptional. The three
leads, Alan Mowbray as M. Topaze,
the respectable professor, Mary
Duncan and Henry Kolker as the
polished crooks, give finished per
formances. Not a flaw is discern
able in their impersonations. The
remainder of the cast is equally
well cast, including the small boys
of the professor's class. The action
is smooth and easy, and the scenes
ably staged and directed.

TIIE LIMESTONE TREE. By Joseph
Hergesheimer. (At the Stanford
Bookstore.)
In this novel, Joseph Hergeshei
mer has discarded his suavity and
much of his cynicism—but none of
his brilliance. The result is a story
of one hundred years of Kentucky
tradition that, is dramatically and
sympathetically told. The author
makes the origin and growth of
mountain law and the resultant

mountain law and the resultant
mountain family feuds vividly and
authentically real to the reader,
through his portrayal of the mem
bers of the Sash family—their bit
ter quarrels and their intense loyal
ties, through four generations.
Gabriel Sash is the first of this
extraordinary family. He returns
from the Indian country, marries,
and disappears. He is never heard
of again, but his spirit illumines the
story of his descendants.
History, tradition, and romance
are interwoven into a moving pat
tern, in this chronicle. Artistically,
the book is very fine—so far super
ior to "The Party Dress," Herge
sheimer's last novel, in depth and
sincerity, that the two books do not
seem to be by the same author.

NEW MOON—At the New Stanford.
"New Moon" has two of the best
voiccs in screendom as well as a
favorable reputation to lift it above
the usual Hollywood musical com
edy. Add good music and subtract
the hope for a unique plot and you
can further balance the merits of
this opus.
The two voices are those of Grace
Moore and Lawrence Tibbett, who
apprenticed at the Metropolitan
Opera Company before graduating
to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer of Culver
City. Their early training, combined
with the improved lalkin' pitcher
equipment, results well enough.
You are bound to get a thrill out of
"Lover, Come Back to Me," and if
you are in the mood, the melodra
matic plot with its inevitable musi
cal comedy ingredients might amuse.
Personally, we rale it well above
the standards set by "The Rogue
Song." —J. T.
