A HAND, FANS, TO
Coach John Bunn, who built
from the ruins of a basketball
organization which had not even
threatened a Blue and Gold
quintet for live long years, a
hoop outfit which, on the night
of January 24, 1931, ended that
long California monopoly in an
overtime thriller that will stand
for years to tome in Stanford s
hall of sports fame. Bunn, as the
Moses of the court game, has
led Indian basketball out ol the
Berkeley bullrushes.
Captain Mike Reynolds, who
played two years of conference ball
as a guard, and then, when the ne\v
coach discovered a scarcity of cen
ters on the Farm, took over the
pivot job. Mike had played many,
many years of basketball, but he and
this new position were total stran
gers. Bunn introduced the two, and
before the end of the season they
had become very well acquainted.
It was a tough spot for Mike, but
he plugged the gap.
I'hil Moffatt, who warmed the
Cardinal bench in 1929 because
Coach "Husky" Hunt could not
ITiul a place for him on that
team, and who did not even turn
out for the court game last sea
son. Held to the gridiron till
only a week before the first cage
contest, "Pliancy Phil" appeared
at the Pavilion one afternoon,
and from that moment, under
the tutelage of Bunn, improved
till he became the dead-eye of
the Redshirt five, and led his
teammates in scoring for the
season.
Vance Fawcett, who, like Rey
nolds, was shifted to a new position
at the start of the season, his last
for Stanford. As a forward on the
freshman quintet of 1928, "Dazzy'
achieved undying fame when he
pulled the final Bear yearling game
out of the fire with a string of field
goals in the last two minutes. As a
forward on the varsity teams of '29
and '30 he was the mainstay of his
squad. But as a guard this season
he was incomparable. Few are the
hoopmen whom Fawcett cannot
dribble around, and few also are
the forwards who can get around
him.
Rudy Rintala, who had not
played in the 1930 season, but
came out late because of foot
hall and immediately caught
Bunn's eye with his sterling de
fensive ability. At the start of
the year lie was also looping
them in from every distance, but
fell into a slump after his need
ed contributions in the U.C. vic
tory. Even after his shooting
eve had completely deserted
him, Rudy could not be kept oIV
the ball team. He fought hard
every minute that he played,
and he didn't let down for a
moment. He seemed never to
tire.
Reggie Meade, who started the
season with a deserved berth at
forward oit the first team, but due
to illness had to sit on the bench
for a month. When he recovered,
he was put back on the five, and
immediately began to demonstrate
that he is a "natural" when it comes
to basketball. Never missing an op
portunity, Reggie is an uncanny
shot. He is smooth on the floor, and
thinks ahead.
Phil Baker, who was relief
guard for either Fawcett or Rin
tala. and showed well in that
capacity. Turning in his best
game down South against the
Trojans, I'hil proved that he is
a good shot as well as a good
man on defense.
Tommy Cordry, who won the
praise of the fans with his fight and
aggressiveness in the forward berth.
Time and again Tommy grabbed
the ball away from lanky opponents,
and every minute kept them wor
ried. However, he fell into a slump
after mid-season, could not locate
the bucket, and shared the remain
ing games with Meade.
Bil! Doub. who replaced the
first-string center whenever
Mike weakened. Bill got the
jump from a lot of tall pivot
men. and never failed to grab a
field goal or two. In the disaster
up at Oakland last Saturday,
Douh's injection into the game
marked a noticeable tightening
in the defense of the Indian.

pulled the final Bear yearling game
out of the fire with a string of field
goals in the last two minutes. As a
forward on the varsity teams of '29
and '30 he was the mainstay of his
squad. But as a guard this season
he was incomparable. Few are the
hoopmen whom Fawcett cannot
dribble around, and few also are
the forwards who can get around
him.
Rudy Rintala, who had not
played in the 1930 season, but
came out late because of foot
hall and immediately caught
Bunn's eye with his sterling de
fensive ability. At the start of
the year lie was also looping
them in from every distance, but
fell into a slump after his need
ed contributions in the U.C. vic
tory. Even after his shooting
eve had completely deserted
him, Rudy could not be kept oIV
the ball team. He fought hard
every minute that he played,
and he didn't let down for a
moment. He seemed never to
tire.
Reggie Meade, who started the
season with a deserved berth at
forward oit the first team, but due
to illness had to sit on the bench
for a month. When he recovered,
he was put back on the five, and
immediately began to demonstrate
that he is a "natural" when it comes
to basketball. Never missing an op
portunity, Reggie is an uncanny
shot. He is smooth on the floor, and
thinks ahead.
Phil Baker, who was relief
guard for either Fawcett or Rin
tala. and showed well in that
capacity. Turning in his best
game down South against the
Trojans, I'hil proved that he is
a good shot as well as a good
man on defense.
Tommy Cordry, who won the
praise of the fans with his fight and
aggressiveness in the forward berth.
Time and again Tommy grabbed
the ball away from lanky opponents,
and every minute kept them wor
ried. However, he fell into a slump
after mid-season, could not locate
the bucket, and shared the remain
ing games with Meade.
Bil! Doub. who replaced the
first-string center whenever
Mike weakened. Bill got the
jump from a lot of tall pivot
men. and never failed to grab a
field goal or two. In the disaster
up at Oakland last Saturday,
Douh's injection into the game
marked a noticeable tightening
in the defense of the Indian.

A HAND, FANS, TO
Coach John Bunn, who built
from the ruins of a basketball
organization which had not even
threatened a Blue and Gold
quintet for live long years, a
hoop outfit which, on the night
of January 24, 1931, ended that
long California monopoly in an
overtime thriller that will stand
for years to tome in Stanford s
hall of sports fame. Bunn, as the
Moses of the court game, has
led Indian basketball out ol the
Berkeley bullrushes.
Captain Mike Reynolds, who
played two years of conference ball
as a guard, and then, when the ne\v
coach discovered a scarcity of cen
ters on the Farm, took over the
pivot job. Mike had played many,
many years of basketball, but he and
this new position were total stran
gers. Bunn introduced the two, and
before the end of the season they
had become very well acquainted.
It was a tough spot for Mike, but
he plugged the gap.
I'hil Moffatt, who warmed the
Cardinal bench in 1929 because
Coach "Husky" Hunt could not
ITiul a place for him on that
team, and who did not even turn

only a week before the first cage
contest, "Pliancy Phil" appeared
at the Pavilion one afternoon,
and from that moment, under
the tutelage of Bunn, improved
till he became the dead-eye of
the Redshirt five, and led his
teammates in scoring for the
season.
Vance Fawcett, who, like Rey
nolds, was shifted to a new position
at the start of the season, his last
for Stanford. As a forward on the
freshman quintet of 1928, "Dazzy'
achieved undying fame when he
pulled the final Bear yearling game
out of the fire with a string of field
goals in the last two minutes. As a
forward on the varsity teams of '29
