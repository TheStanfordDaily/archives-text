# Basketball Prospects Bright For 1932 Season
## EIGHT INDIAN WINS AND NINE LOSSES, FINAL HOOP SCORE Cards Outscore Opposition Averaging 29.7 Points For Each Game 
### Stewart Crawford 
As basketball makes its exit from
, the stage with the shifting of the
j sportlight to track and baseball, the
dopesters are wont to classify, tabu
late, and conclude certain things in
tended to indicate just how suc
cessful or unsuccessful the hoop
season has been.
The Indian basketball year just
! passed leaves eight victories and nine
defeats on the ledger, though one of
: those triumphs can be said to have
j made the season a success. That is
j the line that reads: Stanford 37,
California 32. Just one out of the
three-game series, but the first win
j in five years.
Other results brought to light by
the dope sheet indicate that though
! the Cardinals lost more tilts than
: they won, they scored 505 points to '
497 for their opponents, putting their
' average at 29.7 points per game, to
29.2 for the opposition.
Out of the 17 contests played, nine
were conference tussles, of which ,
the Indians won three, one each '
from every conference rival. Of the
eight non-conference games, Stan- j
' ford was victorious in five.
The complete record follows: *

Prospects for the coming year )
should also come in for a little gos- !
j sip at the end of a basketball season, :
and the Indian chances should not !
! be difficult to discuss, since they are :
not at all gloomy.
Of course, the greatest loss is j
Vance Fawcett, probably the best ;
j cage star that has ever played for '<
this Institution. However, out of the |
I wealth of material for the guarding j
position that Bunn has at present, j
I someone should turn up to fill the
vacancy satisfactorily.
Phil Baker got a lot of experience |
i during the past season, and will be |
favored for that reason to grab the j
guard berth. He will have plenty of ;
competition in John Hancock, Irv j
Tway, and Hal Edelen, besides a i
.jy > ,
man or two coming up from the j
1 freshman quintet.
For the center job, Bill Doub will |
| be directly in line, though the lanky j
| yearling pivot man, Packard, may j
i work in there. Topping, forward for |
the babes, will also have a crack at
this berth.
When it comes to forwards, Bunn |
will have all the talent he could !
desire. With Moffatt returning for j
perhaps his best year on the court, j
one of the berths is already taken '
care of. For the other, Meade, |
' Cordry, Palmer, and perhaps Top
ping will be vieing.
Meade and Cordry have the edge j
in experience, though the latter is |
handicapped from lack of height, j
With Bunn's system given a chance i
, to ground them in fundamentals of ]
the style of play, Moffatt and Meade
should present one of the for- !
ward combinations on the coast.
