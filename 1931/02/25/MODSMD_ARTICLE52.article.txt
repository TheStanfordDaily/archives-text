## 
### 
Undefeated so far this season,
Coach Harry Maloney's varsity box
ers went through light individual
workouts yesterday to begin train
ing for their last intercollegiate
match of the year, against Califor
nia at Berkeley March 6.
After winning the first California
tournament 4 to 3 at Stanford last
week with Captain Fred Johnson,
middleweight, kept out by illness,
prospects look good for Maloney's
men to repeat their victory over the
Beat's and complete the season with
an unblemished record.
Fred Glover, Vance Rogers, Dick
Miller, and Hugh Keenan were in
the Indian winning column against
California, and all of these men are
apparently able to defeat the same
Berkeley opponents again, while
Johnson will reign favorite in His
bout with Nate Magid, Bear middle
weight.
