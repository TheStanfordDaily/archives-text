# FRESHMAN HOOPSTERS END SUCCESSFUL SEASON WITH NINE WINS, FIVE LOSSES
## 
### LOWELL COX 
Although their final game was a
dismal fiasco, the freshman hoop
team can look back this week on a
not unsuccessful season.
Playing an extremely long sched
ule, the babes won nine of their 14
games, and while they failed to
capture the California series, they
at least took one game from an un
usually strong Cub quintet.
Two unaccountable slumps were
the features of the season. After
getting away to a good start, taking
four of their first five contests, the
frosh crashed in mid-season, losing
on successive nights to Menlo Junior
College and Palo Alto High School.
Bunn Rebuilds Team
Coach John Eunn immediately set
about a rebuilding process, with the
result that after a week's intensive
drill on fundamentals, the yearlings
played a respectable game against
California, although dropping a 22
to 39 decision.
Then followed a long string of
wins, climaxing in a thrilling 42 to
33 victory in the second contest with
the Bear Cubs.
It looked as if the youngsters had
"arrived," when they collaosed ut
terly in the rubber game with Cali
fornia, taking their worst trouncing
ol the season in losing, 55 to 19.
Season Toe Long
Possibly a contributing factor to
that final disappointing performance
was the long season. One thing is
certainâ€”Coach Bunn plans to short
en next year's frosh schedule ma
terially, devoting as' much time as
possible to fundamentals, rather

! than to the winning of games.
Several players were developed
| during the past season who will un
doubtedly see service on the varsity
; during the coming seasons.
Topping Outstanding
Topping, tall, fast, and cool, was
| the outstanding player of the lot.
Hampered by injuries received in
; the first Cub fracas, lie was brilliant
in the Santa Clara and second Cali
i fornia game. When he is "right" he
ift a demon on both offense and
defense, and should work into a
I forward berth on the varsity in a
j season or two.
Packard's height will be valuable
at center when he has had more
j seasoning, but it is doubtful if he
I will be ready for the big time by
1 next season.
Several excellent guards were de
| veloped during the course of the
I season. Smith showed more piom
j ise than any, when he was forced
j out in mid-season with a broken
j wrist.
He played throughout the first
j Cub encounter in spite of the break,
| and was the best Stanford babe on
the floor. One of his greatest assets
j is his ability to tank baskets from
| well back of the foul line.
Seavcr Versatile
Jenkins' height made him valu
! able, while Seaver, the versatile
1 divot-digger, looks like a comer.
Massey played a fast game at for
i ward, lacking only a reliable shoot
; ing eye to make him a star, while
i Maentz and Panero also showed
' promise when they broke into the
i game at forward.
