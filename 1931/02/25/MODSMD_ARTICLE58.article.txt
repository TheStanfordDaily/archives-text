# FROSH TRACKSTERS WILL OPEN SEASON AGAINST ALL-STARS
## 
### 
With the opening date of the !
freshman track season set for Sat- l
urday when the Stanford babes will j
compete against the San Francisco !
All-Stars, the Cardinal hopes for a i
successful year in first-year compe- j
tition appear dim.
Only six of Coach Bill Ellington's ]
proteges were able to grasp places
in ihe interclass meet last Thurs- j
day, and none was able to take bet- i
ter lhan a third or fourth place,
with the exception of Edmonds, who
tied for second in the vault. Will
son, Azevedo, and Lyman appear
the outstanding men of a mediocre
squad. Burch got a fourth in Ihe
880 and Saxe finished third in the
two-mile grind to complete '34's
scoring for the afternoon.
The All-Stars are a group of re
cruits selected from the best of
San Francisco's school track
men. Little information on their
relative merits can be gained but
last year a similar team went down
to a 7fl to 43 defeat at the hands
rf '33's track squad.
