# VARSITY TRACK MEN COMPARE WELL WITH S.C.
## Cards Should Reach Top In Cinder Pile; Trojans Meet In L.A. 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Coach ''Dink" Templeton's var.-ity
trackmen should climb back up to
the top of the Pacific Coast cinder
pile this year it seems, after a com
parison of last Friday's Trojan
squad meet in Los Angeles with
early season marks hung up by the
Indians.
Frank Wykoff, star sprinter of the
, S.C. team, ran the 75-yard dash in
the good time of 7.7 seconds and
won the 100 in just under 10 flat,
■ showing that he will be very much
in the running when the Trojans
meet intercollegiate rivals. Stanford,
I however, will have little fear of
being left out of short distance
reckoning, with Les Hables, Hec
Dyer, and Frank Lombardi compet
i ing.
Ilahles Holds 10ft Record
Hables has the Coast's best time
in the century recorded this year
( to his credit, taking the interclass
meet 100 in 9.7 seconds. The Trojan
quarter-milers ran 220 yards last
Friday in the time of 22 seconds.
Since the Red and Gold distance
! men all ran half distances in the
squad meet, little can be concluded
from their performances, except that
Clif Halstead, miler, who won the
half in 1 minute 59.6 seconds, is
capable of a fast mile.
S.C. Jumpers Good
Dean Cromwell's men looked oest
in the jumping events. Barber won
first place in the broad jump at 23
feet 7Vi inches, a distance that Arne
West of Stanford should have little
trouble in eclipsing later in the tea
son. McNaughton, Norcross, and
Teague tied for first in the high
jump at 6 feet, a good two inches
better than Templeton's jumpers
1 have been doing.
Bob Hall won both weight events,
putting the shot 44 feet 4 inches, and
throwing the discus about 150 feet.
I Both Nellie Gray and Here Laborde
of the Redshirts can take Hall in the
i shot, while Bob Jones has hurled
j the platter 152 feet on several occa
i sions.

Dean Cromwell's men looked oest
in the jumping events. Barber won
first place in the broad jump at 23
feet 7Vi inches, a distance that Arne
West of Stanford should have little
trouble in eclipsing later in the tea
son. McNaughton, Norcross, and
Teague tied for first in the high
jump at 6 feet, a good two inches
better than Templeton's jumpers
1 have been doing.
Bob Hall won both weight events,
putting the shot 44 feet 4 inches, and
throwing the discus about 150 feet.
I Both Nellie Gray and Here Laborde
of the Redshirts can take Hall in the
i shot, while Bob Jones has hurled
j the platter 152 feet on several occa
i sions.
