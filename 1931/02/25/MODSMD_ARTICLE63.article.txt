# BABE BATSMEN DOPED TO DROP SAN JOSE TILT
## Lack Of Pitching Material Handicaps Yearlings; Anderson Stars 
### 
Stanford's yearling balsmon will
undergo an acid (est when they
clash with San Jose State College
on Ihe freshman field today at '5:l. r >
o'clock.
Handicapped by a shortage of
moundsmen, the babes go into the
contest with decidedly unfavorable
odds against them. Anderson is a
sterling flinger, but as he is not
made of iron he is unable to pitch
every inning for the babes.
Savinskie is the only relief for
Anderson th.it has appeared in
games so far and, while the oppo
sition hit him hard, on occasions his
support has not been very steady.
The new combination of Robinson
at short and Pete Holmes on second
bpse improves the infield play but
there still remain some ragged
edges. Robinson made one of the
sparkling plays of the season in
Monday's game with S(. Ignatius,
when he leaped high in the air to
pull down a hard-hit drive over
his head.
Goldman, left fielder, has played
his position in outstanding fashion
and is getting his share of hits at
the plate. His work has stamped him
as future varsity material.*
