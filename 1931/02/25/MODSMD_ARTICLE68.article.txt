# ROBESON SEEKS WIDE UNDERSTANDING OF NEGRO RACE THROUGH ITS MUSIC
## 
### 
A more widespread appreciation j
I of negro music is the aim of Paul I
I Robeson, celebrated negro baritone
j who will sing here in the Pavilion, |
' March 2, in the last concert of the
| A.S.S.U. series.
"If with my music," Robeson has
written, "I can recreate for an audi- >
ence the great sadness of the negro j
slave in "Sometimes I Feel Like a |
Motherless Child," or if I can make j
I it know the convict of the chain !
| gang, make it feel his thirst, under
j stand his naive boasting about his
j strength, feel the brave gaiety and
| latent sadness in "Water Boy"; if I
can explain to it the simple faith of |
the negro in "Weepin' Mary," then I i
J shall have increased its knowledge
and understanding of my people.
"They will sense that we are j
i moved by the same emotions, have
I the same beliefs, the same longings
—that we are all humans together, j
j That will be something to work for
j —something worth doing."
During his early successes with the
I Provincetown Players, Robeson used
j to entertain the studio gatherings of
the village with his singing of negro
| spirituals. Among his listeners were
i some of the foremost personalities
J of art and letters.
Heywood Broun said of him, after
| one of these occasions," It seems to
me that Robeson does a little better

| with spirituals than any one else I
j know. He is closer, I think, to the
1 fundamental spirit of the music. Into
j his voice there comes every atom j
1 of the passionate feeling which in- !
i spired the unknown composers of
| these melodies. Robeson's singing
1 of "Joshua Fit de Battle of Jericho"
| will be one of the most exciting ex- |
I periences in your life."
On the program which the famous j
| baritone will present here next Mon- :
i day two groups of these spirituals !
I will be included. Tickets for the ;
concert may be obtained at the of- i
I fices of the A.S.S.U. concert series
! in the Old Union.
