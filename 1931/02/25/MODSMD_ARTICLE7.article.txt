# BAND IS CHOSEN FOR GYM DANCE
## Friday Set For Last Day To Purchase Bids 
### 
Herbert Shapiro's orchestra will
provide music for the formal dance
which will celebrate the opening of
the new Women's Gymnasium on
March 7, according to Jane Snyder,
general dance chairman. Shapiro's
music-makers are the ones who of
fered their services free and played
at the all-University carnival held
last December under the auspices of
the gym committee.
Proceeds from the opening dance
will go to the furnishing fund which
now stands at more than $3600, ac
cording to Elisabeth Larsh, chair
man of the gym committee. Al
though $20,000 has been set as the
amount desirable to furnish the
building completely, plans are being
made by the physical education de
partment to move in at the end of
this quarter. Partial equipment and
decoration will probably take place
during spring vacation.
Bids for the dance, which will be
given on the evening of formal
dedicatory services, are on sale to
members of the Five Hundred for
$3 and may be obtained from gym
committee representatives on the
row or from Jane Snyder in Roble
Hall. Friday has been set as the last
day for the purchase of bids. After
that date, programs will not be
guaranteed, according to Jane Sny
der.
