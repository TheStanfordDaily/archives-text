# DAMES TO SUPPORT ALUMNI DAY PLANS FOR WOMEN'S GYM
## 
### 
As a result of the talk of Mrs.
Chester Thomas, Thursday, at a
meeting of the Stanford Dames, that
organization has voted its support
and co-operation in the plans that
are being made for Alumni Day.
The Stanford group of the Ameri
can Association of University Wo
men has also added its name to the
fast-growing list of those who are
supporting the work of Mrs. Thomas
and her committee.
All the proceeds from the projects
that are being arranged will go to
help with the furnishing of the new
gymnasium. Many of the alumni are
being asked to contribute special
products with which they are con
nected, so that the profits from the
sale of those things will be pure
gain.
