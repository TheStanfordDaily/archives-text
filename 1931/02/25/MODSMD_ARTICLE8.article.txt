LIMA, Peru, Feb. 24 (A 3 ).— Loyal
Peruvian forces moved today to end
the rebellion at Arequipa, which was
seized by dissatisfied troops Friday,
i without resort to arms.
One hundred high officers of the
| Lima garrison met behind locked
. doors in the Military Club last night
and today they decided to send dele
: gates to treat with the Arequipa in
surgents, designating three of their
1 number to fly to the southern city.
The Arequipa forces are said to
have rebelled because they charged
Provisional President Luis M. San
chez-Cerro —who started with their
aid in their city the revolution that
put him in power—had not fulfilled
the principles of his manifesto,
whereby he promised to retire as
soon as normality could be restored
l and a constitutional president
; elected.
