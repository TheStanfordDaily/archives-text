Sim-glfire
Too intense light from
the sun or from any
other source, hurts the
eyes and causes you to
squint and frown. This
uncomfortable glare can
be screened out if you
wear Cruxite Lenses.
Cruxite Lenses (made in
your own prescription)
have a scarcely notice
able fiesh tint. They do
not change the colors of
things. Let us show you
the kindly protection
Cruxite Lenses give.
