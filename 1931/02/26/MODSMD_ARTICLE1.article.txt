# DRY-LAW CHIEF URGES BAN ON CIDER IN ROME
## Sheppard Hits Grape Juice Concentrate Agencies In Senate Plea ACTION NOT UNLIKELY Dry Law Investigation Bill Introduced In House 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. (/P) â€”
Abolishment of immunity from the
prohibition law claimed by manu
facturers of fruit juice concentrates
was sought today by Senator Shop
pard, co-author of the 18th Amend
ment.
In a bill introduced in the Senate
the Texas Democrat proposed to
strike from the Volstead Act that
sentence which says the dry law
penalties shall not apply to a peison
"for manufacturing non-intoxicat
ing cider and fruit juices exclusive
ly for use in his home."
Would Study Dry Law
Meanwhile, on the other side of
the Capitol, Representative Dyer, of
Missouri, an anti-prohibitionist Re
publican, introduced a resolution to
authorize an investigation of prohi
bition by the House judiciary com
mittee to determine whether the
18th Amendment should be repealed
or modified.
Dyer said a Congressional investi
gation was necessary as a result of
the Wickersham Commission report
and the Supreme Court action in
sustaining the validity of the 18th
Amendment.
Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt,
counsel for one of the manufacturers
of grape concentrate, has told the
Wickersham Commission this sen
tence in the Volstead Act was the
ground for legal immunity claimed
by the grape industry.
Postponed Action Likely
II appeared likely tonight that all
prohibition proposals would go over
until next session with adjournment
just a week away.
"Manufacturers of non-intoxicat
ing cider and fruit juices for use in
their homes or elsewhere are not
required by any part of the Vol
stead Act to obtain permits," Shep
pard said, "and this sentence has
served only to create a conflict of
opinion and widespread misunder
standing as to what it really means."
