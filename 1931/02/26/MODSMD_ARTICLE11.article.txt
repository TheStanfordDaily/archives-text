## Johnson Pitches Full Game For Locals As Team Gathers 11 Hits 
### Francis Lloyd 
Allowing only four nits, and strik
| ing out eight men, Dan Johnson
pitched the Stanford baseball nine
; to its third straight conference win
by turning back St. Mary's yester
\ day to the tune of 11-4. The Indians
collected 11 safe hits from the of
ferings of two Gael pitchers—Cap
j tain Stennett and Matson.
With two men out in the first in
ning, Stanford filled the bases with
j two walks and a single which were
1 followed by a single from Campbell
; and a hard slash between left and
; center field, scoring four runs for
the Indians. Again in the second
j inning with two down a run was
forced in when Stennett walked
Delmas after the bases were
j crowded.
Game Cinched
All doubt of the outcome was
eliminated in the third inning when
the Indians shoved over three more
runs to make the count eight for
Wolter's men. Matson took over the
hurling duties for the Gaels at this
point and held Stanford scoreless
until the eighth when a double by
Dixon and singles from Hardy and
Philippi and a sacrifice fly from
Delmas gave the Indians three more
runs.
Keeping the four hits well dis
tributed and giving only two free
passes, Dan Johnson performed in
a business-like and efficient manner
on the mound. By beating St. Mary's
I yesterday the Cardinals captured
the first series win from the Gaels
in several years. Stanford now has
three conference wins for no de
feats, to start the season in an
auspicious manner.
Sensational Catch
Running with his back to the in
field and to his right, Gordon Camp
bell gathered a long drive of Valim,
Gael third-sacker, to make the most
sensational fielding play of the
game. A fast double play, Philippi
to Hardy, cleared the paths of a
few marauding Missionites in the
1 fourth, and closed the inning with
out any scores.
Phil Dixon led the Stanford hit-
