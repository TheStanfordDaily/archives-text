# FLAT TIRES, NOT ROMANCE, CAUSE DEBATERS' DELAY
## 
### 
DURNT-OUT hearings instead
of burning romance, ilat tires
instead of flirtation at Yose
miteâ€”and tlius were the ques
tioning minds of the Farm set
at ease by the quartet of Ore->
gon State debaters, "missing
somewhere in California"' for
the past few days, when they
appeared on the Stanford plat
form yesterday.
Poor telegraph service caused
all the trouble. The four O.S.C.
forensic artists, accompanied by
a faculty chaperone, had a
motor breakdown at Yoncalla,
Oregon, less than two hours
from their home campus.
They dispatched a telegram
to Fresno stating they would
he unable to reach the Califor
nia city in time for their sched
uled contest. When they ar
rived. the telegram was still in
the Fresno office, undelivered.
