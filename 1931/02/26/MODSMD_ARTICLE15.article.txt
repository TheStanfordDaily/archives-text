Much Dribbling
The Sigma Nu - Vagabond clash
was rough and featured by an abun
dance of dribbling. The Vagabonds
found trouble in handling the ball
smoothly while Sigma Nu displayed
more finish in their teamwork.
Little organized offense was pre
sented by either of the teams. The
winners depended on long shots and
a vigorous follow through, with
Polhamus connecting with three
buckets to annex high scoring hon
ors. Glasgow also played a good
game for Sigma Nu. His work in
handling the ball and dribbling was
a great aid to the victors.
Sigma Nu Ahead
The Vagabonds started the scor
ing by sinking a basket early in the
game. Sigma Nu came on with a
rush and at half time were leading
6 to 2. Opening the second period,
the Vagabonds added a free throw
to complete their scoring efforts for
the evening. From this point it was
all Sigma Nu.

By mutual consent the Dekes and
Phi Kappa Sigma postponed their
engagement. Beta Theta Pi forfeited
to Kappa Alpha.
