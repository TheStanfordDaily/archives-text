# Politics Holds Interest As Vocation Says Young

Playtime has come for ex-Gover
\ nor C. C. Young, now living in
i Professor Taylor's home on the
I campus.
'This is my first uninterrupted
vacation," says the former chief
| executive of California, "and I am
thoroughly enjoying it." Asked
which of his three life works he
liked best—teaching, real estate
maniplation, or politics—Young re
plied that all three were delightful,
and that the state work was perhaps
i the most interesting.
The distinguished campus resi
dent said, "The Stanford plays rate
I with professional performances.
'Wings Over Europe' was one of the
most finished productions I have
, ever seen.
"I read The Daily often. You have
I a good paper, sane and thoughtful.

i The printing of national dispatches |
gives the busy student a coverage
of the most important news when
he hasn't time to read the metro
politan papers."
I Tennis, walking, and wide read- !
I ing, he says, are his hobbies. The
Stanford gol fcourse and tennis
, courts provide diversion, and he
looks forward with interest to the j
I track and field meets.
{ Mrs. Young is a Stanford gradu
ate; Young secured his degree from
, California. He declared that "at
Berkeley it was at first thought that
j Stanford was an unwelcome upstart,
' but that view has since changed."
The ex-Governor and Mrs. Young,
| together with their two daughters,
' who are Stanford students, will sail |
in June on the Britannic for a
j three months' trip through Europe. I
