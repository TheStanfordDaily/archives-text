# Lost O.S.C. Debate Teams Participate In Dual Meet Here
## Northern Women Meet Locals in Afternoon on Ghandi Topic; Men Discuss Chain Store Situation With Stanford in Evening's Meet BOTH DEBATES ATTRACT LARGE AUDIENCES Alice Small, Thelma Hogevoll Represent Stanford on Question of Ghandi in India 
### 
"lost teams" of Oregon State College engaged in two well-supported
non-decision debates with the Stanford forensic squad yesterday.
Alice Small and Thelma Hogevoll took the affirmative for Stanford
against Alice Ingalls and Dorothy Druschell of Oregon in the afternoon
in the Little Theatre on the question, "Resolved, that Ghandi is a benefit
to India." In the evening in the Little Theatre William Dienstein and
Edwin L. Gerhardt took the affirmative for Stanford against George
Hartley and Gordon Winks of the northern school 011 the subject, "lie-

solved, that the expansion of the
chain stores is detrimental to the
best interests of the American
j people."
Chain Stores Menace
In denouncing the expansion of
the chain stores, the Stanford men
said that the economic gain brought
by chain stores is outweighed by
the social loss. They said that it is
not as the chain stores are now that
is detrimental, but it is their con
tinued expansion that will form a
menace to America.
The affirmative also pointed out
that the independents are being
driven out of business, and that the
chain stores are liable to stifle the
ambition of the working class by
making the employment outlook
limited to being a hireling indefi
nitely.
Independents Fail
j The Oregon State negative team
maintained that the methods of re
tailing have been raised by the
chain store, that the chain stores
have increased the efficiency of all
merchants, and that even before the
day of the chain stores 90 per cent
of independent merchants failed
within a few years of opening up.
It was stressed that all the leading
authorities agree that the chain
stores are a benefit, and that there
is no possibility of them forming a
monopoly.
The arguments put forth by the
Stanford women in supporting
Ghandi were that Great Britain has
helped India only in the interests
of Great Britain, and that Ghandi
has accomplished in a short time
more than Great Britain has been
able to do in 300 years.
Ghandi Detrimental
j The negative team from the north
( em school said that Ghandi's stand
| for absolute independence is detri
mental both to the internal and cx
| ternal security of India. They also
| showed that Ghandi, in- being op
posed to hospitals, medicine, and
vaccination, is objecting to sorw of
j the greatest safeguards of the lives
! of his people.

Mrs. Ben Allen, who officiated at
the afternoon debate, declared it
was "interesting and enlightening
both to Ghandi enthusiasts and sym
pathizers of England." Carl F. Bow
man presided in the evening.
