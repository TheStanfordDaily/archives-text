# IT'S UP TO THE COUNCILS
## 
### 
Whether or not the names of students convicted of
cheating or otherwise violating the Honor Code in the fu
ture will he published is a question to he decided this week
by the Men's and Women's Councils. They are the bodies
responsible for the enforcement of the Code. If the Code
succeeds as an effective force in Stanford student life, it
is the Councils' success; if it fails, it is their failure.
So it is up to the two Councils to consider carefully the
matter of publishing names of convicted cheaters. For
several years tlit' Code has limped along, creaking often
under the pressure of student and Council indifference.
There are some students who have questioned its worth,
and there are many who have criticized the timid policy
pursued by most student Councils.
But this year a serious effort is being made to bring
about real enforcement of the Honor Code. The Executive
Committee is doing what it can to give the Code a fair
chance to prove its worth. The President's Office is sup
porting the Committee in all that it does.
Now it is the turn of the Councils to show whether or
not they want the Honor Code and are willing to enforce
all its provisions. The rule, to become effective March 1,
t'hat every student sign a pledge printed on the examina
tion blue books will do away with the unconscious viola
tors of the ('ode. There will be no one after March 1 who
won't realize what the Code is and what it requires of the
student.
In the future every Violator of the Code will be a de
liberate cheater. Students guilty of breaking the ('ode pro
visions will be guilty of doing so intentionally. They will
have been instructed concerning the Code, and there will
no longer be any excuse for "unthinking" cheating. It's
all cheating anyway, and deserves to be punished and
punished severely.
When an individual flunks out of Stanford, he is barred
from the University for three quarters. A little cheating
might have given him a passing average. If he flunks out
a second time, he is permanently expelled from the Uni
versity. Cheaters deserve at least as severe treatment as
this.
And, in addition, there is no reason why their names
should not be published. When a student does something
well, he is glad to have publicity on it. When he does
something badly, he should expect the same kind of treat
ment.
The publishing of names of convicted Honor Code vio
lators would be a powerful deterrent against malicious and
intentional cheating. With the posted explanation and
signed pledge proposals soon to go into effect, there will be
no cheating which is not deliberate.
The Men's and Women's Councils will do well to au
thorize the publication of names of student cheaters, who
do not belong at Stanford, and in so doing provide a guar
antee of the successful operation of the Honor Code.

The publishing of names of convicted Honor Code vio
lators would be a powerful deterrent against malicious and
intentional cheating. With the posted explanation and
signed pledge proposals soon to go into effect, there will be
no cheating which is not deliberate.
The Men's and Women's Councils will do well to au
thorize the publication of names of student cheaters, who
do not belong at Stanford, and in so doing provide a guar
antee of the successful operation of the Honor Code.
Whether or not the names of students convicted of
cheating or otherwise violating the Honor Code in the fu
ture will he published is a question to he decided this week
by the Men's and Women's Councils. They are the bodies
responsible for the enforcement of the Code. If the Code
succeeds as an effective force in Stanford student life, it
is the Councils' success; if it fails, it is their failure.
So it is up to the two Councils to consider carefully the
matter of publishing names of convicted cheaters. For
several years tlit' Code has limped along, creaking often
under the pressure of student and Council indifference.
There are some students who have questioned its worth,
and there are many who have criticized the timid policy
pursued by most student Councils.
But this year a serious effort is being made to bring
about real enforcement of the Honor Code. The Executive
Committee is doing what it can to give the Code a fair
chance to prove its worth. The President's Office is sup
porting the Committee in all that it does.
Now it is the turn of the Councils to show whether or
not they want the Honor Code and are willing to enforce
all its provisions. The rule, to become effective March 1,
t'hat every student sign a pledge printed on the examina
tion blue books will do away with the unconscious viola
tors of the ('ode. There will be no one after March 1 who
won't realize what the Code is and what it requires of the
student.
In the future every Violator of the Code will be a de
liberate cheater. Students guilty of breaking the ('ode pro
visions will be guilty of doing so intentionally. They will
have been instructed concerning the Code, and there will
no longer be any excuse for "unthinking" cheating. It's
all cheating anyway, and deserves to be punished and
punished severely.
When an individual flunks out of Stanford, he is barred
from the University for three quarters. A little cheating
might have given him a passing average. If he flunks out
a second time, he is permanently expelled from the Uni
versity. Cheaters deserve at least as severe treatment as
this.
And, in addition, there is no reason why their names
should not be published. When a student does something
well, he is glad to have publicity on it. When he does
something badly, he should expect the same kind of treat
ment.
