Fearful that they might <l<> something constructvc, the
Kxecutive Committee this week defeated a motion lhat
would have done away with class vice-presidencies and
consolidated the offices of class secretary and class treas
urer into one, to be elected once a year.
('.lass elections at Stanford are conducted in a slipshod
who-gives-a-damn manner, because the class ofiicers are
merely figureheads, who wouldn't have anything in par
ticular to do even if they had the ability to do it. The
motion defeated by the Kx Committee, if carried, might
not have remedied the situation completely, but it would
have eliminated some of the deadwood and divided the
job of doing nothing between two people, instead of among
four as at present.
One of the arguments advanced against the motion was
the plea that, inasmuch as the officers elected for the last
half of their senior year retain those titles forever and a
day, all four positions should be retained. Hut what is the
value in being known as secretary % of the ('.lass of I'mpty-
Iwo, when everyone that ever attended Stanford knows
that if doesn't mean anything?
It is obvious that four class offices are exactly four too
many in nearly every case, and the Kx Committee, in re
fusing to clear awav some of the rubbish, is merely putting
ofT the dnv until the offices die of sheer malnutrition.
