The Editor, Sir:
Not long ago we were sure that
all problems connected with the
Honor System had been solved by j
the changing of the word, "System," i
to "Code."
Time has shown that we were <
mistaken in that fond hope, but it ;
is with great delight that I note the j
recent action of Dr. Swain and the j
Ex Committee. My only fear is that |
they have not gone quite far enough j
in the right direction.
It is in this humble spirit, and in |
the hope that I may co-operate with J
this noble work, that I offer the ■
following suggestions:
(1) That the student be required I
to write on every paper, report, and !
examination, the following state- •
ment, "I swear by the Bible, the ;
Koran, The Talmud, and the Books |
of Confucius that I have received !
no aid unbefitting a Stanford lady |
or gentleman or in any way con- j
trary to the spirit of the Honor
Code."
(2) That this statement be written j
by the student with his own blood.
Small knives may be provided in
all classrooms for the cutting of j
thumbs or wrists. If the student [
cannot sign his name, he may make j
his mark in the presence of two j
witnesses and a Notary Public. If a j
student bleeds to death it is to be j
presumed that he has violated the ;
Honor Code.
(Ii) Accept no work without this i
guarantee. Beware of imitations. |

(4) That aeroplane pilots be hired
to write in the sky over the campus
the following words, "Respect the i
Honor Code, Honor is in the blood
of all sons and daughters of the
Stanford Red.''
(5) That a large placard be pasted
over the front of the Memorial
Church setting forth the principles
of the Honor Code as adopted by
the Ex Committee.
(6) That, in order that students
may be sure that they are trusted
by the faculty, the answers to all
examination questions shall be
written on a blackboard in the front
of the classroom.
(7) That no student shall, at any I
time, look at his examination paper
while he is writing it, but that he
shall look about constantly to see 1
if anyone is cheating in the room. |
Anyone who looks at his paper shall
be considered a violator of the Code.
(8) That, in accordance with the ;
sense of the Ex Committee, penal- 1
ties for violation of the Code shall
be drastic. For a third offense the !
student should be required to spend i
his Christmas vacation away from
the campus.
I trust that these modest pro- ,
posals v/ill be adopted. I claim no j
credit for having invented them; ;
they are merely the logical exten
sion of the fine principles under I
which the Ex Committee is already
working.
Your most humble servant,
Edwin E. Williams. '
