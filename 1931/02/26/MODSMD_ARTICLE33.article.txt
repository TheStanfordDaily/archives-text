THE GREAT MEADOW—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
A noble show. Not quite the epic
jso glowingly advertised, but the
| spirit of pioneer heroism, which is
I the main theme of the picture, is
; caught to a fine degree. The treking
of the little group of settlers from
Virginia to Kentucky during which
murderous Indians have to be
fought of?, and blizzards struggled
| through, and hunger born, is rather
impressive.

You won't be swept off your feet
by this picture—the action is rather
1 slow, and even the surprise attack
on Daniel Boone's little fort by sev
t eral hundred Indians is not tremen
dously blood-curdling. Yet there
j are a number of scenes which are
J stirring without being sentimental,
i Eleanor Boardman's performance
, of Dione, the heroine, could hardly
be surpassed. Johnny Mack Brown
| is somewhat disappointing. You will
enjoy the dialogue. All of the char
acters give a remarkably faithful
! representation of the quaint pioneer
i manner of talking. —M. L. R.
