## 
### 
Rather ludicrous are the impres
sions of pompous old strutters which
mean to us the Victorian theatre. A
life of the most outstanding strutter
is slightly unconvincing.
Here is Gordon Craig, leader of
the revolutionaries among scenic
designers and son of the late Ellen
Terry, acting like the veriest school
boy with eyes wide open and star
ing at the almighty that was Irving.
It takes Craig some time to make
up his mind whether the book is to
be biographical or autobiographical,
but after the first few chapters one
feels that perhaps Irving is getting
a little the best of it.
Shaw, the critics when
Henry was forcing members of that
profession to search out new super
latives, receives Craig's spiteful at
tention several times.
In conclusion: Craig is a better
designer than author, though this
book has the advantage of being a
personal reminiscence. —J. S. S.
