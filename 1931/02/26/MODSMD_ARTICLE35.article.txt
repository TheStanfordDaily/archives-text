# APRON STRINGS—At the Geary Theatre, San Francisco.
## 
### 
Although superlatives are not jus- j
tified, Apron Strings is a warm, hu- i
man, and lovable play, from the ,
first line to the last. The famed com
edy team of Kolb and Dill has
rather small parts, but they make

these so thoroughly delightful that !
the audience sits back and beams
whenever either is on the stage.
Dill is the somewhat henpecked I
but irrepressibly fun-loving bus- i
band of the dominating Mrs. Orwoll
—the latter played with spirit by
Jane Darwell.
With his distinguished iron-grey
hair, whimsical humor, and ingra- ;
tiating voice, Kolb becomes a world
ly lawyer of charming manner. I
The lovely heroine, Grace Staf- !
ford, wears gowns and evening
robes guaranteed to make a plain |
girl beautiful, and a beautiful girl
irresistable—the latter result in her
case.
The plot of "Apron Strings" deals
with the regeneration of an ossified
Sir Galahad who is too incredibly !
good to be alive. Many clever lines
and light laughter and amusing
situations — sophisticated implica
tions ingeniously masked by the i
general harmlessly naive surface
give the play a gratifying flavor.
