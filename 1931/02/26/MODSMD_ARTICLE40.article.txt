# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
there ought to be a law against
people who give exes in the first
week of spring people who don't
have exes when you do people who
don't study for them anyway people
who wrote complicated poetry in
spain in 1800 the man who invented |
a school that functioned between
february and october
what have we done to deserve
such torture but just when you get
used to girls in short sleeves it
starts raining again the world is like
that
cabbages is going to start an ,
anti cheating campaign if no
one else does it cheating is such
a iilthily childish pastime most
college students are silly all
right but you'd think they'd stop
at damned idiocy
spring brings an inevitable in
crease in the number of names filed
for three-day notice with the coun
ty clerk well why not why not what
two would want to live as cheaply
as one anyhow
on sufficiently violent request we |
will incorporate a matrimonial bu
reau in the rest of the columns pub- I
lie duties eligible bachelors' names '

will be listed and all ineligible
co-eds blacklisted guess that's put
ling it plainly enough
in fairness to the public we
find ourselves forced to an
nouncc the awful truth those
mysterious debaters weren't lost
or stolen or even threatened
with abduction they came and
debated and departed so scot
land yard has quit worrying
about them thank you

and another thing is the perpetual !
look of the orange steel framework
they've erected for the new gates 1
clown at the foot of palm drive
| that's a sign of progress too things
cabbages most strenuously objects
to usually are but why why why do
we have to have gates anyway they
i are asylumish how can even mild
breezes of freedom blow naturally
in a place that looks like an insti
tution even on the outside
now we know why there is a
course called institutional malad- j
| justment it's for people who still j
! act prep-schoolishly conceited and
forget there was a hello system once
, reform reform a soap-boxer in
: golden gate park has nothing on us
' it's a wonderful feeling
