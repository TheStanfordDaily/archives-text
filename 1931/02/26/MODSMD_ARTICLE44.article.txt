TRACK'S HONOR ROLL
Another sure sign that track
season will soon take the throne
of > the sports world for the en
suing three or four months is
the appearance of Spaulding's
Official Track and Field Hand
book, and the Athletic Almanac
for If).')!. In these volumes one
may find records of every sort
and description, besides advice,
rules, and directions on "How
to Run a Track Meet." Of inter
est to the Farm fan, however,
is the fact that (hese record
pages are dotted with the names
of Stanford track and field stars,
past and present.
Included in a list of athletes in
(he handbook under the caption
"Collegiate Honor Roll" are no less
Ihan seven of last year's Indian oval
performers. Hec Dyer is mentioned
twice, both for his 9.6 time for the
hundred made in the dual affair
with U.S.C., and his 220 record of
21.3 made in the 1.C.4-A. meet.
Johnny Morrison and Ike Hables are
listed in the 440 hall of fame, the
former with a mark of 48.G made
against the Trojans and the latter
for his time of 48.8 in southern divi
sion conference competition.

Arnie West and Virg Dowel I
gained broadjumping fame with
(heir leaps of 24 ft. 7 :l h in. and
24 ft. 5% in., respectively, in
the 1.C.1-A. meet. Podge Smith
is recognized as famous for tak
ing the high hurdles of the
southern division meet in 15
seconds flat.

Harlow Rcthert and Eric Krenz
practically monopolize the recogni
tion given weight-men. Rothert
heads the list of shot-patters with
his record of 52 ft. 1 1 ■> in., while
Krenz is placed second for his toss
of 51 ft. 2 :i B in. The mighty Eric
leads Ihe famous discus-throwers
with his mark of IG7 ft. 5 :! « in., and
Harlow is included for throwing the
platter 153 ft. 7 :, 4 in. in the 1.C.4-A.
meet. This pair of point-grabbers is
also included on a college all-star
team which the handbook names.
Among the Stanford stars of
earlier years that are to he
found in the volume is Bob
King, who still holds the 1.C.4-A.
record in the high jump that he
established in 1920, when lie
leaped (i ft. s : 'i in. Bud Spencer'
of the 1!)28 Cardinal team holds
an official worlds record in the
400-meter distance with the
time of 47 seconds flat. He also
ran on the Olympic team which
set world's mark of 3:13.4 in the
mile relay.
Incidentally, Templeton could use
some of Bob King's high jumping
this season. Then, too, he would
probably not find it hard to locate
a place for Bud Spencer on the
squad, or "Swede" Leistner, who
holds a world record of 14.8 seconds
in the 110-meter high hurdles event.
And among the seven 1930 Red
shirt stars that Spaulding's hand
book has made famous, only three
will be performing for Dink again
this season.
However, by the end of the
track competition for 1931, sev
eral names new to the track
world will have been gathered
to he placed in this little book
with (Stanford) after them.
Perhaps those of Gray. Laborde,
and Jones will take care of the
Cardinal representation in the
weight list. And to fill the shoes
of Morrison in the 440 there is
Eastman. Arnie West, Hec
Dyer, and Ike Hablcs should
repeat in next year's volume,
while its publication might re
veal another Hablcs with some
thing like 9.5 in the hundred
following his monicker.

TRACK'S HONOR ROLL
Another sure sign that track
season will soon take the throne
of > the sports world for the en

the appearance of Spaulding's
Official Track and Field Hand
book, and the Athletic Almanac
for If).')!. In these volumes one
may find records of every sort
and description, besides advice,
rules, and directions on "How
to Run a Track Meet." Of inter
est to the Farm fan, however,
is the fact that (hese record
pages are dotted with the names
of Stanford track and field stars,
past and present.
Included in a list of athletes in
(he handbook under the caption
"Collegiate Honor Roll" are no less
Ihan seven of last year's Indian oval
performers. Hec Dyer is mentioned
twice, both for his 9.6 time for the
hundred made in the dual affair
with U.S.C., and his 220 record of
21.3 made in the 1.C.4-A. meet.
Johnny Morrison and Ike Hables are
listed in the 440 hall of fame, the
former with a mark of 48.G made
against the Trojans and the latter
for his time of 48.8 in southern divi
sion conference competition.

Arnie West and Virg Dowel I
gained broadjumping fame with
(heir leaps of 24 ft. 7 :l h in. and
24 ft. 5% in., respectively, in
the 1.C.1-A. meet. Podge Smith
is recognized as famous for tak
ing the high hurdles of the
southern division meet in 15
seconds flat.

Harlow Rcthert and Eric Krenz
practically monopolize the recogni

heads the list of shot-patters with
his record of 52 ft. 1 1 ■> in., while
Krenz is placed second for his toss
of 51 ft. 2 :i B in. The mighty Eric
leads Ihe famous discus-throwers
with his mark of IG7 ft. 5 :! « in., and
Harlow is included for throwing the
platter 153 ft. 7 :, 4 in. in the 1.C.4-A.
meet. This pair of point-grabbers is
also included on a college all-star
team which the handbook names.
Among the Stanford stars of
earlier years that are to he

King, who still holds the 1.C.4-A.
record in the high jump that he
