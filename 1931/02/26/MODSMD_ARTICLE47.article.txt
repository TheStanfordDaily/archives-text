### 
V'Hien the San Francisco All-Stars !
jo i -ney to the Farm Saturday to
elh with Stanford's yearling track j
sc,v ad Ihey will give local followers j
of die ancient sport their first line j
oi the possibilities of the babe ag- j
I g! .'gallon.
Composed of picked men from j
t Sari Francisco's prep schools, the i
All-Stars have never bean able to ;
take the measure of a Stanford !
squad. Last year against the formid
( able Indian freshmen they dropped
i the meet by the lopsided score of
; 79 to 43.
Prospects Arc Poor
Prospects for this year's Card j
team have been none too rosy in j
I pro-season appearances. With a few !
j of outstanding calibre, the bulk of I
j the men turning out for the sport i
| have displayed less than average j
J Stanford freshman ability.
I Jimmy Willson has been breezing j
through the century in good times, (
and he should be able to best any :
! man the AH-Stars may offer.
Lyman and Kantzer have made j
| good showings in the weights, with \
j Lyman appearing the best with the ;
I shot and Kantzer specializing in the ;
j discus throw.
Doped to Win Mile
i Azevedo looks to be a cinch to
; triumph in the mile, and Owens
| and Cameron have been circling the
! 440 in fair time. Owens also runs
j the 220 dash, he and Williams being i
| the best men in that event.
I Meiro leads the field in the high
| jump. Packard from the basketball 1
! squad is bolstering Card prospects
j in this event, as well as hurling the
J discus. Wright, also from the bas
j ketball squad, has turned out for
i the 440 this week, while Jenkins has ;
j been trying his hand with the discus.
