EUGENE, Ore.. Feb. 25.â€”Pennsyl
vania's policy of putting athletic
coaches on a strictly professorial
basis is ideal but not practical,
stated President Arnold Bennett
Hall of Oregon University here yes
terday.
Dr. Hall pointed out that Oregon
tried this same scheme two years
ago and found it unwise to employ
a coach of national reputation ex
cept by a long-term contract.
"There is too much competition
among coast conference. schools in
the matter of coaches' salaries to
make a complete professorial sys
tem practical here," Hall said. "In
the East, where coaches are not so
highly paid, it might be possible to
employ them as professors and pay
them accordingly."

Royalty from six countries are
now gathered in London.
