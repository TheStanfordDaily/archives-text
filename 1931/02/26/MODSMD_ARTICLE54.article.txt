# DINK'S ROSTER OF TRACK AND FIELD STARS COMPLETE
## West Recovers From Hurt: Received In Practice Early This Year 
### Fritz Goodwin 
With Arnie West out at the Oval
again these afternoons, fully re
covered from a leg injury sustained
in an early squad practice meet,
Dink Tcmpleton's collection of star
track and field athletes is once more
almost complete.
Burt DeGroot reappeared at prac
tice the other day to help fill the
gap in the pole vault, which has
been a weak spot in the Stanford
line-up recently.
Ned Johns is still kept out of the
sawdust pits by a broken hand.
When he returns to the fold, Tem
pleton should have three vaullers
capable of around 13 feet in De-
Groot, Deacon, and Johns.
Credit Due West
West is an excellent broad-jumper
who has never come in for his due
share of credit on the Farm. Having
won the event at the 1.C.4-A. meet
last year with a leap of 24 feet 7 3/ s
inches, West holds the position of
foremost jumper among the present
collegiate crop, and his point-win
ning services on the Indian team
this season will be invaluable.
Results of the interclass meet at
Berkeley last Saturday indicate that
Templeton's strong outfit will have
little to fear from the Bears in the
Big Meet this year. The Blue and
Gold trackmen looked equal to ihe
early season Indians in only one
event, the two-mile, which Moss
man won in 9 minutes 49 seconds.
Muir succeeded in getting under
10 flat in the century to win the
first heat in 9.9 seconds, a time
which falls just short of the 9.B's
and 9.7 of Dyer and Hables on the
Stanford track. Sparks won a 200-
yard dash at Berkeley in the good
time of 20 seconds flat.
Zellman, veteran California mid
dle-distance man, had to be con
tented with a tie for first place
with Wright in the 80, which was
timed at 2 minutes 0.4 seconds.
The Bears looked particularly
weak in the weights, winning marks
being only 129 feel 5 inches in the
discus, 44 feet 4 inches in the shot,
and IG6 feet 8 inches in the javelin.

share of credit on the Farm. Having
won the event at the 1.C.4-A. meet
last year with a leap of 24 feet 7 3/ s
inches, West holds the position of
foremost jumper among the present
collegiate crop, and his point-win
ning services on the Indian team
this season will be invaluable.
Results of the interclass meet at
Berkeley last Saturday indicate that
Templeton's strong outfit will have
little to fear from the Bears in the
Big Meet this year. The Blue and
Gold trackmen looked equal to ihe
early season Indians in only one
event, the two-mile, which Moss
man won in 9 minutes 49 seconds.
Muir succeeded in getting under
10 flat in the century to win the
first heat in 9.9 seconds, a time
which falls just short of the 9.B's
and 9.7 of Dyer and Hables on the
Stanford track. Sparks won a 200-
yard dash at Berkeley in the good
time of 20 seconds flat.
Zellman, veteran California mid
dle-distance man, had to be con
tented with a tie for first place
with Wright in the 80, which was
timed at 2 minutes 0.4 seconds.
The Bears looked particularly
weak in the weights, winning marks
being only 129 feel 5 inches in the
discus, 44 feet 4 inches in the shot,
and IG6 feet 8 inches in the javelin.
