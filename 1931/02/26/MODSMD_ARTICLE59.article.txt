BALTIMORE, Md„ Feb. 25. (TP) —
That'4o members of the faculty of
Johns Hopkins University have
gone on record as favoring the abo
lition of intercollegiate football at
the university was revealed yester
day.
Dean Edward Wilber Bery's talk
on the future of athletics at Johns
Hopkins at the annual faculty ban
quet paved the way for the passing
of a resolution on the part of the
professors urging Ihe abolition of
football and the substitution of a
system of intramural sports.
The resolution was so worded to
urge the end of football alone, in
the hope that the policy would
create an opening wedge for the
cessation of all intercollegiate sports
at the university.
