# LOCAL WATCHMEN HAVE STRANGE JOBS Cactus Garden Offers Work For Campus Policemen SKUNKS BAGGED HERE ON FARM BY BURNS
## 
### 
Night watchmen on the campus
find themselves confronted with
strange obligations.
George A. Burns, chief night
policeman of the campus, makes the
nocturnal round in his Dodge road
ster. A frequent change of automo
biles, Burns feels, is what is needed
in his job, since at the first sound
of the Dodge, the regular habitues
of the cactus gardens start up their
own cars and scatter in all direc
tions.
A debt of gratitude is also due
Burns on another score'. Skunks, for
some reason or other, are fond of
the Farm. Burns has bagged 75 of

| them during the current season.
L. R. Miller, whose job is turning
off lights and locking doors on the
i Quad, finds his greatest problem the
{ over-zealous students who study all
night in the classrooms and rely on
him to rouse them for breakfast.
Statistics disillusioning to those
1 who like to think of the glamour
| of college life are offered by Leon
ard Olafson, who guards Encina and
the other halls. Encina, that tradi
tional hotbed of college night life
j and racket, ordinarily whoops it up
| with a few phonograph records un
j til about 11 o'clock, according to
i Olafson.
