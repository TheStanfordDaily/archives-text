# NIEDERAUER AND COX LOSE COURT MATCH TO WEESNER-FORBES
## 
### 
Chuck Weesner and Bob Forbes
yesterday held onto their third
place doubles laureis by downing a
tough Phil Niederauer-Wilbur Cox
combination, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. All the
more credit is due the victors, since
, Niederauer and Cox had just re
! turned from their conquest of the
San Jose Tennis Club tournament
netmen, where they gained their
: sixth consecutive title.
Weesner and Forbes had previ
ously defeated Trow Stephens and
i Hubert Butler somewhat easily on
Tuesday by a score of 6-3, 6-2. Far
i ther down the list Eichelber.ger and
j Bergstrom breezed through Haehl
! and Baker, 6-0, 6-1, to stay in
eighth place.
; Nothing of importance happened
yesterday in the varsity singles
play. Tuesday, however, saw John
! Gordon stave off Hubert Butler s
' attack on his eleventh position by a
, 6-4, 6-4 score, and Howard Blethen
i took Russ Robinson, 6-3, 7-5, to
jump into thirteenth place.
Ninety-eight per cent of the 350,-
