# FRENCH CLUB HEARS PROFESSOR GUERARD SPEAK AT MEETING
## 
### 
French civilization of the present
day is primarily concerned with the
small manufacturer and small shop
owner as opposed to great commer
cial interests, in the opinion of Pro
fessor Albert Guerard, professor of
comparative and general literature,
who spoke at a meeting of the Cercle
Francais last night.
"It is for this reason that modern
French writers oppose the American
system of mass production and fear
the americanization of the world,"
he continued.
"These differences are, however,
only temporary. The physical and
intellectual traits of nations are
constantly changing. The old Uncle
Sam of caricatures has given place
to the rotund, short business man
as the typical American, and the
aristocratic Russia of pre-war times
has become the Russia of today."
