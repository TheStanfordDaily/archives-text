# STANFORD NINE MEETS BRONCS IN TWO GAMES
## Indians Face Santa Clara On Local Diamond At 1:30 O'Clock BRONC HURLER IS GOOD Eddie, Loomis Will Pitch For Varsity 
### Francis Lloyd 
Baseball fans on the Farm will be
treated to a double-header tomor
row when the Stanford nine meets
Santa Clara in a twin engagement
in the local park beginning at 1:30
o'clock. Wolter plans on using Eddie
and Loomis on the mound for the
Indians with Johnson to be kept in
reserve.
Lots of trouble may be expected
from O'Daniels, the Broncos' star
hurler, who held the Indians score
less during the five innings he
pitched in the first encounter at
Santa Clara. The Broncs took a bad
beating from California on Wednes
day when the Bears scored a 16-4
triumph. However, neither Thomas
nor O'Daniels pitched for Mails's
men, and as result, little can be
gathered about the respective
strength of the teams.
Indians Encouraging
There were several features of
the game with the Saints on Wed
nesday which arc a cause for belief
that the Farm will have a cham
pionship team this year. After sev
eral exhibitions of poor base run
ning in the first games of the sea
son, Wolter's men never wavered
once while on the paths in the St.
Mary's game. While the Gaels had
eight men left on base, Stanford
only marooned four around the
sacks.
Eight runs were scored by the
Indians after two outs had been
registered. In the first, second, and
third innings no Stanford man
reached first until there were two
away. This ability to score runs
when the team is decidedly "in the
hole" is an encouraging indication
of that highly desirable quality—
fighting spirit.
Outfield Doubtful
The question of who is to play in
the outfield for the Redshirts is be
coming more and more involved
with Dixon in a hitting streak,
Campbell fielding better every day,
Captain Hunken playing the best
all-around game of his career, and
Rintala fast rounding into shape and
apparently hitting with his old-time
vigor. Unfortunately four men can't
play the outfield, and so one man
will have to be eliminated.
