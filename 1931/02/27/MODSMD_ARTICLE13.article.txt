# Robeson Career One Of Success In Varied Fields
## Baritone Stars As Athlete, Actor, Musician 
### 
The career of Paul Robeson, fam
ous negro baritone who will appear
here Monday, is one of the most
sensational in the modern musical
world.
Son of a New Jersey minister, he
won a scholarship at Rutgers Col
lege for his unusual record in high
school. He received his letter in four
major sports while in college, and
was chosen as All-American end in
1917 by the sports writers. In addi
tion to these athletic honors, he was
the school's star debater, won a Phi
Beta Kappa key, and was acclaimed
by his associates as "the perfect
type of college man."
After his graduation he entered
Columbia University to study law,
and after he had received his de
gree he was persuaded by Eugene
O'Neill to play in "Emperor Jones."
His success as an actqr was instan
taneous, due to his dynamic per
sonality and melodious voice, and
he was soon engaged to appear in
"All God's Chillun Got Wings,"
"Porgy," and "Black Boy," a play
written especially for him. Other
successes are numbered among his
dramatic achievements.
During the past three years he
has been the idol of the theatrical
world in London where he played
in "Show Boat" at the Drury Lane
Theatre, and as "Othello" in Mau
rice Browne's production of the
Shakespearian tragedy.
With all his success on the stage,
however, he has centered his at
tention upon the interpretation of
the songs of his people. As early
as his appearance in "Emperor
Jones" he used to entertain studio
gatherings of the village with his
songs. In 1925 he gave his first re
cital with the negro pianist, Law
rence Brown, who will accompany
him in his campus concert.
His program here will consist of a
large majority of these spirituals, in
addition to a classical repertoire
which he handles with real ability
and appreciation. Tickets for the
concert are still on sale at the of
fices of the A.S.S.U. series in the
Old Union.
