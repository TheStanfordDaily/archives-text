## 328 to 79 Majority Registered in Lower Body; Hoover Advances Many Arguments Against Measure In Message; Senate to Act Today 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2G. (/P) —Turning its back upon President Hoover,
the House today overrode his veto of the Veterans Loan Bill by '.12H >
to 7!). The decision came less than an hour after tbe House bad received |
the veto message from the White House. The veto then was sent to the
Senate where it was agreed to take it up at 11 o'clock tomorrow, after
Senator Johnson, Republican, California, had sought to bring it up for
an immediate vote. The House vote was preceded by an effort by Repre
sentative Tilson of Connecticut, the majority leader, to have the Chief

5 Executive's veto sustained by offer-
I ing a substitute that would apply
j only to needy veterans. It was
I shouted down.
| The atmosphere was tense as the 1
I President's message, calling the
! legislation "unwise from the stand- |
I point of the veterans themselves 1
land unwise from the standpoint of I
j all the people" was read.
Hoover Lists Faults
Proponents held their lines stoutly
but the President's appeal swung 40
Republicans to his side.
In his mesage, President Hoover
told Congress the legislation would
impose a potential cash outlay of
$1,700,000,000 if all the 3,400,000
veterans applied. Veterans Adminis- ,
trator Hines, he said, estimated it
would cost $1,000,000,000.
