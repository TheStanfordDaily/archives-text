# PALO ALTO IN ROW WITH P. G. & E. OVER STANFORD METERS
## 
### 
| In order to consolidate all gas
j equipment on Stanford's campus,
j the Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany has offered Palo Alto $3,506
! for the meters and regulators still
! owned by the city. The company
! purchased the mains from the Uni-
I versity about three months ago.
S Ernest S. Erwin, assistant comp- 1
! troller at Stanford, said last night
| that the University was completely
out of the deal, and that it remained
; for Palo Alto's city council to de
j cide whether or not to accept the
i offer. The P. G. and E. is under no
; obligation to purchase the remain- [
I der of the system, according to Er- :
I win.
At a meeting of the council late i
j Wednesday the opinion was ex- .
i pressed that the city's holdings were
more valuable than the price of
fered, holding them at about $6,000.
C. H. Christiansen, the mayor, said J
that the matter has been referred j
to the committee on public works, :
which will consider the ultimatum
and decide on the advisability of
; fighting the matter.
