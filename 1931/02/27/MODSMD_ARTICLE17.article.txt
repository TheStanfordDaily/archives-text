# McRae Advises Changes In Grade, Exam Systems
## 
### 
Abolition of the grade system, of
: all examinations except finals, and
1 of bawlout ratings, and increased
use of the independent study plan—
| this is advocated by Kenenth Mcßae,
Men's Council member, as a remedy
I for the present Honor Code prob
i lems.
A petition will be circulated next
week throughout the student body,
Mcßae announced in an interview
! which, upon attaining a sufficient
number of signatures, will be pre
sented to the Administration. It will
request that the changes listed
j above be made.
"Several prominent faculty mem
! bers have approved the plan heart
j ily," Mcßae declared, "and I am
confident Ihat it will go through.
"I feel that the Honor Code can
never be enforced satisfactorily un
der the present methods of admin
| istering it, and 1 believe that elimi
nation of the grade system, of all
, examinations except finals, and of
i bawlout ratings, would have a de
j cidedly bolstering effect upon the
Code." *
I Discussing defects of the present
system, Mcßae said, "The Code has
been misunderstood from the begin
j ning, particularly by incoming
freshmen. Students have failed to
I obey the precepts of the Code and
to report violations of it. The Ad
j ministration has failed to segregate
I the habitual cheater from the rest.
! The malicious violator has not been
|eliminated from our midst. Endeav

ors of honest students have not been
recognized, since opportunity to ob
tain a higher grade by cheating has
been open to those who wish to
take advantage of it, and too much
freedom is allowed the student dur
ing examinations.
"In adjusting this situation, I be
lieve that substitution of a plus
! minus system of indicating the
J value of work done by students for
| the present grac'v system would
I eliminate one of the most pro
j nounced causes of cheating, that, of
1 comparison of grades and the rc
( suiting desire to rate just a point
I higher than someone else.
I "Increasing the number of stu
| dents working under the independ-
I cut study plan would make for
j more individual responsibility and
! honesty.
} "Substitution of quarterly essay
typo examinations for frequent rx
! animations would eliminate the
j number of opportunities for cheat
ing. The plus-or-minus cxamina
[ tion and others of the 'shotgun' type
| should be abolished, since they form
a particularly good medium for dis
| honorable conduct.
"Talk alone about the Honor Code
: won't get us anywhere. If the Code
| is to remain and succeed, it must
be vigorously enforced. The stu
dents are faced with the alternative
]of either strictly enforcing the
! Honor Code or endeavoring to re
move the incentives to violations,
such as the competitive grading sys
-1 lum."

Abolition of the grade system, of
: all examinations except finals, and
1 of bawlout ratings, and increased
use of the independent study plan—
| this is advocated by Kenenth Mcßae,
Men's Council member, as a remedy
I for the present Honor Code prob
i lems.
A petition will be circulated next
week throughout the student body,
Mcßae announced in an interview
! which, upon attaining a sufficient
number of signatures, will be pre
sented to the Administration. It will
request that the changes listed
j above be made.
"Several prominent faculty mem
! bers have approved the plan heart
j ily," Mcßae declared, "and I am
confident Ihat it will go through.
"I feel that the Honor Code can
never be enforced satisfactorily un
der the present methods of admin
| istering it, and 1 believe that elimi
nation of the grade system, of all
, examinations except finals, and of
i bawlout ratings, would have a de
j cidedly bolstering effect upon the
Code." *
I Discussing defects of the present
system, Mcßae said, "The Code has
been misunderstood from the begin
j ning, particularly by incoming
freshmen. Students have failed to
I obey the precepts of the Code and
to report violations of it. The Ad
j ministration has failed to segregate
I the habitual cheater from the rest.
! The malicious violator has not been
|eliminated from our midst. Endeav

ors of honest students have not been
recognized, since opportunity to ob
tain a higher grade by cheating has
been open to those who wish to
take advantage of it, and too much
freedom is allowed the student dur
ing examinations.
"In adjusting this situation, I be
lieve that substitution of a plus
! minus system of indicating the
J value of work done by students for
| the present grac'v system would
I eliminate one of the most pro
j nounced causes of cheating, that, of
1 comparison of grades and the rc
( suiting desire to rate just a point
I higher than someone else.

j number of opportunities for cheat
ing. The plus-or-minus cxamina

a particularly good medium for dis
| honorable conduct.
"Talk alone about the Honor Code
: won't get us anywhere. If the Code
| is to remain and succeed, it must
be vigorously enforced. The stu
dents are faced with the alternative
]of either strictly enforcing the
