## Seats Still Available For "Royal Family," On Assembly Boards 
### Betts Hawkins 
Seats are available for to
night's performance of "The
Royal Family" and may be pur
chased at the Box Office. Re
served seats are priced at $1.25,
$1, and 75 cents. "Roughs"
seats will go on sale for 50 cents
at 7 o'clock in the office.

With a cast headed by Ruth
Beede, this scintillating comedy
written by George S. Kaufman and
Edna Ferber will be presented to
night in the Assembly Hall at 8:30
o'clock under the direction of Harold
Helvenston.
This will be the second lead Ruth
Beede has taken on the campus
stage, her earlier appearance being
in "The Mistress of the Inn." She
is to play Julia Cavendish, the suc
cessful actress, who confronted with
the choice of leaving the stage for
a career of matrimony, finally proves
subservient to the wishes of those
whom she loves.
Variety of Roles
The play offers a wide variety of
roles, ranging from the 20-year-old
Gwen Cavendish, whose charming
enthusiasm lends a colorful vividness
to the play, to the elderly grand
mother, whose vital interest is still
centered in the stage world.
Both veterans and newcomers
have major roles in the cast. Kath
erine Keho, well-known for her in
terpretation of Maggie in "What
Every Woman Knows," will have the
most difficult characterization to
play. Her part tonight is different
from any of her previous impersona
tions, and calls for a forceful, "com
pletely in character" interpretation
of a 72-year-old woman.
Carter In Debut
Nelson Carter, playing the impu
dent and entertaining Tony Caven
dish, will make his debut as an
actor in a Stanford production other
than Football Gaities and Junior
Operas. Much of the action centers
around the amusing escapades
caused by his fascination for women.
As the impetuous granddaughter,
Caroline Hall is offered an excel
lent opportunity to win the approba
tion of the audience.
Virginia Ingrim, playing opposite
Jack Hinchliffe, portrays an actress
who "likes what she likes, talks
when she pleases and believes in
acting natural."
Ernie Mendenhall, Lucille Morgan,
and Max Kolliner have roles which
although minor, are important both
to the plot and the humor of the
play.
"The Royal Family" has a compli
cated and amusing theme which af
fords a clever satire on the "home
life" of any typical stage family.

Nelson Carter, playing the impu
dent and entertaining Tony Caven
dish, will make his debut as an
actor in a Stanford production other
than Football Gaities and Junior
Operas. Much of the action centers
around the amusing escapades
caused by his fascination for women.
As the impetuous granddaughter,
Caroline Hall is offered an excel
lent opportunity to win the approba
tion of the audience.
Virginia Ingrim, playing opposite
Jack Hinchliffe, portrays an actress
who "likes what she likes, talks
when she pleases and believes in
acting natural."
Ernie Mendenhall, Lucille Morgan,
and Max Kolliner have roles which
although minor, are important both
to the plot and the humor of the
play.
"The Royal Family" has a compli
cated and amusing theme which af
fords a clever satire on the "home
life" of any typical stage family.
Seats are available for to
night's performance of "The
Royal Family" and may be pur
chased at the Box Office. Re
served seats are priced at $1.25,
$1, and 75 cents. "Roughs"
seats will go on sale for 50 cents
at 7 o'clock in the office.

With a cast headed by Ruth
Beede, this scintillating comedy
written by George S. Kaufman and
Edna Ferber will be presented to
night in the Assembly Hall at 8:30
o'clock under the direction of Harold
Helvenston.
This will be the second lead Ruth
Beede has taken on the campus
stage, her earlier appearance being
in "The Mistress of the Inn." She
is to play Julia Cavendish, the suc
cessful actress, who confronted with
the choice of leaving the stage for
a career of matrimony, finally proves
subservient to the wishes of those
whom she loves.
Variety of Roles
The play offers a wide variety of
roles, ranging from the 20-year-old
Gwen Cavendish, whose charming
enthusiasm lends a colorful vividness
to the play, to the elderly grand
mother, whose vital interest is still
centered in the stage world.
Both veterans and newcomers
have major roles in the cast. Kath
erine Keho, well-known for her in
terpretation of Maggie in "What
Every Woman Knows," will have the
most difficult characterization to
play. Her part tonight is different
from any of her previous impersona
tions, and calls for a forceful, "com
pletely in character" interpretation
of a 72-year-old woman.
