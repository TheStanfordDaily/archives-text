# CZAR'S FRIENDS HONOR BIRTHDAY
## German Bulgarian Society Gives Reception 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 26 (fP).â€”Friends of
the former Czar of Bulgaria, Ferdi
nand, today celebrated his seven
teenth birthday for him, Ferdinand
himself having left Germany several
days ago on a trip to Egypt pre
scribed by his physicians.
Although no word has been re- ;
ceived from him since he left Cor- j
burg, his ancestral residence, he is j
believed to have reached Cairo.
The celebration of his natal day
in Berlin took the form of a recep- j
tion by the German Bulgarian So- j
ciety, of which he is an honorary
member, for the Bulgarian colony
here.
He is one of the European Ex- !
royalties upon whom the loss of i
royal pomp and circumstance sits 1
lightly.
Ferdinand abdicated just about a j
month before the German royalties '
in a body followed his example. He
left his son, Boris, then 24 years t
old, on the Bulgarian throne which J
the latter now shares with pretty
young Princess Giovanna of Italy, j
