## 
### 
Belgium's nursery of young scien
tists has revived pre-war interest
in research, Dr. Jules Duesberg,
recor and professor of anatomy at
the University of Liege, said last
night in a lecture in the Little
Theatre.

After various financial struggles,
interest in scientific research had
gained a hold in Belgian universi
ties, but post-war situations caused
the desertion of the laboratories,
stated Dr. Duesberg. The ease of
making a living was given for the
lack of research at that time.
The Committee Nationale, of
which Dr. Duesberg is a member,
is composed of men from the four
universities of Belgium, and was
organized to create interest in re
search.
A second lecture will be given by
Dr. Duesberg in the Little Theatre
tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
on "Cytological Observations on the
Centrifuged Egg of Ciona." The
talks are under the auspices of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
