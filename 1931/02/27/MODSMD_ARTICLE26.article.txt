# PLAN OFFERED BY UNIVERSITY FOR HOSPITAL
## Proposal Made To Finance Needed Equipment For New Building COUNCIL OKEH NEEDED Lease Contract Would Run For Five Years 
### 
The University administration
last night solved the problem of
j financing the equipment of the new
Palo Alto Hospital with an offer to
the City Council to purchase all the
' necessary X-ray, surgery and laun
dry apparatus and lease it to the
city. As a maximum, the University
offered to pay $42,500.
If the plan is approved by the
City Council, as recommended by
j its committee on ways and means,
the city of Palo Alto will lease the
equipment from the University by
' the year, with an option to renew
the arrangement until the debt is
completely paid. The lease-con -
tract as offered by the University
will last for five years.
Amounts to Loan
According to Ernest Erwin, assist
ant comptroller of the University,
the plan as extended to the city
amounts to lending the city the
money to buy the equipment. Since
municipalities are prohibited by law
from borrowing money, the method
of repayment by lease-conti'act is
the only legal means by which the
University can finance the furnish
ing of the hospital.
During the five year period while
the lease-contract is in operation,
the city would actually be repaying
■ money borrowed from the Univer
sity with interest, while legally it
; will be paying the rent due on its
| lease.
Old Site for Sale
A good part of the money with
which the city expects to repay the
University will come from the sale
of the site of the old hospital.
Appraised two years ago at $32,-
000, the property at today's de~
j flated real estate values is declared
ito be worth only $21,000. The city
council voted to wait for a more
\ attractive offer, which is expected
when real estate regains its normal
value in a year or so.
