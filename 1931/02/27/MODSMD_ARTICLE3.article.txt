# WAR TANK BUMPS ALONG ON QUAD; PINCHED BY COP
## 
### 
APPARENTLY a climax to
the recent discussion of
campus militarism, an armored
tank was observed yesterday
to be grinding its way along a
hitherto peaceful Quad.
Effective enough as dance
publicity for the Military Ball,
it fell under the restraining
hand of the law when Gordon
Davis, campus traffic officer,
drew alongside and ordered it
to pull over to the curb.
The student tank-skinners,
sensing for once the value of
preparedness, descended into
the armored depths and slam
med a steel-enforced door in
Davis' face. But civil authority
prevailed and the tank was
forced to park according to
regulation.
Automobiles and aeroplanes
are admitted to the campus by
comparatively recent legisla
tion. Davis has been able to
find no statute concerning
tanks of war.
