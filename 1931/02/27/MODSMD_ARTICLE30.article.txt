# ABOUT THOSE TICKET RULES
## 
### 
One of the provisions of the new ticket rules adopted
by the R.A.C. to apply to future Rig (ionics is the lumping
together in one application class of all students and paid
members of the Alumni Association who have attended
the I niversify one year or more.
Formerly, preference was given over students to paid
members of the Alumni Association v wh© had spent two
years or more here. Students were given preference over
alumni of less than two years' residence and unpaid
alumni. Henceforth, payment of alumni dues by those who
have attended Stanford for one year or more, but less than
two years, will give those persons ticket privileges equal
to the privileges of students, and of paid alumni of two
years' or more residence.
While il is indeed a heart-warming sight to see groups
of enthusiastic alumni releasing pent-up emotions and
yelling "What a (lame! What a Spectacle!" the ticket
situation seems of deeper significance to The Daily.
It is a question of immediacy of interest. The Univer
sity experience means more to those who are actively par
ticipating in il than it does to those who relive it in mem
ory and brief visits to the Stadium. The Rig Game is a
stirring part of that experience. Recognition of this is one
of the reasons for giving the undergraduate rooting section
Ihe choicest seats. Rut the same reasoning should be ap
plied to the allotment of tickets to members of the student
body who do not sit in the rooting section.
The R.A.C. has taken a forward step in putting students
011 a par with paid Alumni Association members of two
years' or more I niversily residence. Rut lowering the bars
to admit to the same preferential class a group of Alumni
Association members who have attended the University
for less than two years is prejudicial to the interests of
students and alumni who have a more intimate attachment
to Stanford.
