Supreme Court has upheld the eonstitulionalitv of the
Eighteenth Amendment, reversing the ruling of Federal
Judge William ('.lark of New Jersey, who held that the
amendment had been improperly ratified.
Of course, the Supreme Court was called upon to rule
only upon the validity of the "ignoble experiment," not
upon its workableness. The Wickersham Commission had
already done that in a voluminous report unequalled any
where for its sophistry and lack of clarity. The decision
of the judicial body simply brings home once again the
fact that the nation is merely skirting the edges of its great
est problem certainly not unaware of what lies at the core
of il, but apparently unwilling to do anything about it.
