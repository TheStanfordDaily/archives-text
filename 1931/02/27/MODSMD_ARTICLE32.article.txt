The charge that I lie average student manifests obvious!
disinterest when called in to listen to a professor's lecture, I
lias beciranswered by The Daili/ (lalifornian mi a fashion
calculated to make the professors mediate. The editorial
follows:
"The university faculty, ever since we have known it,
has bewailed a mien of unconcern and irresponsibility on
the part of the average undergraduate. We do not chal
lenge this contention. II is obvious enough. Hut in placing
the blame for our academic relaxation, we can't help be-'
licving that we are not alone at fault.
"The student who wanders into the lecture room, re-;
garding the lecture as no more than an obstacle to his train
of thought, is not without a counterpart on the lecture plat
form. II is safe lo say that a large percentage of the leelur-,
ing faculty is absorbed in some form of outside research,
which may be a hobby of the moment or the work of a life-;
time. To stand before an audience of disinterested slu
dents, struggling year after year lo impress them with
fundamentals, can reach, perhaps, the height of boredom.,
And in consequence of these conflicting altitudes, nothing
is achieved but a spirit of mutual animosity.
"The faculty, since it is in a position to swing our under- j
graduate mental pendulum, can be expected to take the
first step. By accepting ils audience as more than mere
chattel, by injecting some measurc*of ardor into its dis
sertations, the lecturer should be able ty) bring about
through the nalilral process of contagion a genuine student 5
interest in academics."
