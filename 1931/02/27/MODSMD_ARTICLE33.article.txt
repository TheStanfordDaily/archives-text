Mild congratulations to the Spar
tan merbers of the Class of '33
who are smiling, this morning, after
the final election farce that took
place yesterday. Speaking of stuff
ing the ballot boxesâ€”they had to
have a larger one made to order.
Some one of them forgot that Daily
walls have ears, and spent a good
half-hour at mid-day phoning Iris
friends to tell them what a really
remarkable guy he was. Maybe it's
worth the effort. We'll take ignom
iny on whole wheat, for ours.
Ye noble local followers of
R. T. Jones will have a good
chance for speculation, tomor
row, when the annual interclass
golf tourney gets under way
Ratings, we are assured, will be
made according to the number
of feminine campus rooters a
player has not. It's actually to
be done in the manner of an
cient Stanford Roughism.
We wail a bit, in passing, over
the degradation of that once noble
specimen, the Rough. An essay
should be written on his decline.
He started the breakdown by shav
ing once a week. Then he walked
home with Hor from the libe, in
broad daylight. Now that one of

them has been caught wearing a
shirt beneath his sweater, and an
other upstart has dared to appear
at a boxing match with a collegiate i
dame clutching his elbow, there's
nothing left but to sigh.

All that is left to the campus-dra
matic society is to be called
pians" in glaring headlines. The '
rest is done. What with tv/o Paly
audiences and a bunch of Bohe
mians shouting noisily for more [
Wings over Europe, we have a fu
ture.
Tonight another of their pro
ductions is coining up for in
spection. "Tlie Royal Family,"
Cabbages supposes, is like the
story of what happens up in the
big house on the hill, on Proxy's
night out? (Published but sup
pressed in 1920, by Campus O.
Pinion.)
The freshmen have a battle on i
hand tomorrow morning, when they '
start a new season of track compe- i
tition against the San Francisco
All-Stars. Paging another Rothert,
Krenz, or even a second Dyer. Give
the little sprinters a great big hand.
Just toe the line, boys, and let the
discus fall where it may. Records
will, anyhow.
