TWO THIEVES—By Manuel Kom
rotf. Coward-McCann. $2.50. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Komroff's book has something in
common with Kristin Lavransdatter,
that much-heralded Norso work. It
is, with Kristin, couched in childish
language, full of naive expressions.
But it goes a step farther than
Undset's work in introducing to an
cient Syria a pair of cooing Grecian
flappers who detract quite as much
from the book as its infantile con
struction.
No hope of being considered
sophisticated or very intelligent
causes vis to put our faith more
readily in Michael Arlen and kind;
rather it is lack of patience which
does.
The author has achieved a final
touch of irony—the only one in the
book—which is satisfying if famil
iar. —J. S. S.

WILDERNESS—By Rockwell Kent.
The Modern Library. (At the
Stanford Bookstore.)
This is a journal of quiet adven
ture in Alaska, the day-by-day ac
count of how two human beings
fared in the peaceful solitude away
from civilization.
The salt tang of the ocean covers
the book as a fog covers San Fran
cisco. "Wilderness" was not written
for the feeble-hearted, the unima
ginative, the namby-pamby. It ap
peals to the bold, the adventure
some: it is a book for the potential
wanderer. It is a book to be enjoyed
not by the tourist, but by the
traveler. "Wilderness" is the kind
of' book that would thrill Marco
Polo, or Columbus, or Lindbergh.
