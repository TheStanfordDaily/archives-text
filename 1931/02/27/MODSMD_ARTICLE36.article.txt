# DOUGHNUTS GOBBLED BY HUNGRY ROUGHS
## 
### 
Judging from the proceeds of the
Theta Sigma Phi doughnut sale,
rain in the air seems to have a good
effect on the appetites of Stanford
students.
Theta Sigma Phi, women's na
tional honorary journalistic society,
in their weekly doughnvit sale held
in front of the Women's Clubhouse
yesterday between 10 and 12 o'clock,
collected $12 toward their annual
scholarship, for which the sales are
being held.
