Here is proof that the Car
dinal basketball season has
breathed its last for the 1 f>'i 1
season. Coach John Bunn, shak
ing his head in a mournful
manner, announced that cage
activities on the Farm have
degenerated into a malted milk
drinking contest among the
members of the squad. For a
certain Palo Alto merchant,
proprietor of a popular restau
rant and fountain, has offered
to each of the hoopmen a malt
for every game in which he
scored.
However, there remain a few
words to be said about basketball,
since the three-game playoff series
between the Bears and Washington
is • yet to be played. These contests
are scheduled to take place in
Seattle on the evenings of Friday,
Saturday, and Monday, March 6,
7, and 9. The Huskies have won
their half of Ihc conference for
three years in a row, but have
failed in each attempt to defeat the
southern representative.
Last year it was the Trojans
who downed the H. of W. for
the Coast hoop crown, and the
year previous it was the lilue
and Gold five. Fans in this state
have acquired the habit of con
ceding victory to the southern
champions without waiting for
the pla.volV, a practice which
may receive quite a jolt tins
season.
Regardless of Nibs Price's opinion
on how good his cjuintet is, as evi
denced by the fact that ho placed
11 five of them in the first ten of
his selection for all-southern half
honors, we figure that the Bear will
take a couple cn thd nose. In the
first place, there is that time-worn
but perfectly justified alibi that the
invading team is at a disadvantage,
because of the train ride, etc.

Of course California is a
greatly improved ball club. Still
the fact remains that they drop
ped a tilt to Oregon State when
that quintet was on a barn
storming tour during Christmas
vacation, as did such other
strong bay teams as
Kossi Florists, and the Olympic
Club. Though the State outfit
looked good down here, they
are evidently not in it with the
Huskies. Therefore we believe
that the Bear live will find itself
in company that is a trifle too
fast. —Crawford.

strong bay teams as
Kossi Florists, and the Olympic
Club. Though the State outfit
looked good down here, they
are evidently not in it with the
Huskies. Therefore we believe
that the Bear live will find itself
in company that is a trifle too
fast. —Crawford.
MORE HOOPS
Here is proof that the Car
dinal basketball season has
breathed its last for the 1 f>'i 1
season. Coach John Bunn, shak
ing his head in a mournful
manner, announced that cage
activities on the Farm have
degenerated into a malted milk
drinking contest among the
members of the squad. For a
certain Palo Alto merchant,
proprietor of a popular restau
rant and fountain, has offered
to each of the hoopmen a malt
for every game in which he
scored.
However, there remain a few
words to be said about basketball,
since the three-game playoff series
between the Bears and Washington
is • yet to be played. These contests
are scheduled to take place in
Seattle on the evenings of Friday,
Saturday, and Monday, March 6,
7, and 9. The Huskies have won
their half of Ihc conference for
three years in a row, but have
failed in each attempt to defeat the
southern representative.
Last year it was the Trojans
who downed the H. of W. for
the Coast hoop crown, and the
year previous it was the lilue
and Gold five. Fans in this state
have acquired the habit of con
ceding victory to the southern
champions without waiting for
the pla.volV, a practice which
may receive quite a jolt tins
season.
Regardless of Nibs Price's opinion
on how good his cjuintet is, as evi
denced by the fact that ho placed
11 five of them in the first ten of
his selection for all-southern half
honors, we figure that the Bear will
take a couple cn thd nose. In the
first place, there is that time-worn
but perfectly justified alibi that the
invading team is at a disadvantage,
because of the train ride, etc.

Of course California is a
greatly improved ball club. Still
the fact remains that they drop
ped a tilt to Oregon State when
that quintet was on a barn
storming tour during Christmas
vacation, as did such other
strong bay teams as
Kossi Florists, and the Olympic
Club. Though the State outfit
looked good down here, they
are evidently not in it with the
Huskies. Therefore we believe
that the Bear live will find itself
in company that is a trifle too
fast. —Crawford.
