# Babes In Track Debut Tomorrow
## ALL-STARS LIKELY TO UPSET INDIANS IN CINDER MEET Marks Of Prep School Men Better Than Records Of Babe Outfit 
### 
Possibilities that the San Fran
-1 cisco All-Stars will provide an un
set in their meet with the Stanford
I freshmen tomorrow at 10:30 on the
; old oval loom in the comparison of
! the respective times and distances
! made by the two squads this year.
In general the prep school marks
j equal or better those hung up by
Coach Bill Ellington's crew. Ac
i cording to the dope, there is only
i one event, the mile run which Aze
, vedo has done in 4:37 in which
Stanford figures to better the high-
I school stars. Kenna of Mission High
i has clone but 4:40 in that event this
! year but he is capable of cutting
j that time.
Sprinters Equal
Jimmy Willson's best mark for
this year is 0:10:1 but he is expected
| to break 10 flat in Saturday's meet.
Williams from Sacred Heart has also
been clocked in 0:10:1 this season.
Burch's time of 2:7 in the 880 is
j shaded by Sarrile of Polytechnic
High who has done 2:6.
Murphy and Cameron, Card
quarter-milers, have both been
{ going close around the 53-second
; mark. They will have plenty of
competition from Ray, a Polytechnic
i man, who has also done 53.
Lyman Good in Shot
Kantzcr of the Indian squad and
Fitzgerald from Polytechnic will
i battle it out in the discus throw,
both doing around 130 feet, but
! Fitzgerald figures to take the best
' the freshmen can offer with the
javelin, as he has hurled the spear
over 174 feet. Lyman is doped to
take the shot put with little trouble,
since he will be tossing the 12-
pond weight, and is capable of "46
feet with the 16-pounder.
Weaver, Guitard, and Willson,
1 with the fourth man unchosen as
yet, is Coach Ellington's tentative
selection for a relay team.
