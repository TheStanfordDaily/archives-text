# REDSHIRT, BRUIN POLO FOURS TO MEET IN TWO-GAME SERIES HERE NEXT WEEK
## 
### LOWELL COX 
Stanford and U.C.L.A. will meet
' on Ihe polo field for the first time
next week, when the Indian and
Bruin riders will clash in a two
, gams series 011 the highway field.
Captain R. A. Gordan last night
j announced arrangements for the
| matches, which will be played on
Thursday and Saturday afternoons.
Although dropping two thrilling
matches to the crack University of
Arizona four last week-end, the
Redshirts will be big favorites to
: take both contests from the Bruins.
Polo is a comparatively new sport
| at the southern institution, and as
yet a high-scoring team has not
been developed. Stanford, on the
1 other hand, this season has what is
i believed to be the best quartet in
! its history.
The Redshirts held the Arizona
i four scoreless for nearly three
; periods in Monday's game, a feat
! which had. not been accomplished
before this year, according to Cnp-
I lain Gene R. Mauger, coach of the
Wildcats.
Plans for a series to be played
I here next quarter with the New
Mexico Military Institute riders are
also being made. The Institute is

j noted for the polo players it pro
j duces, three members of the Ari
; zona team and Captain Jack Mc
: Dougall of Stanford being among its
; graduates.
Another series is being arranged
' with U.S.C., to be played here on
April 16 and 18. The Trojans have
! been playing polo several seasons,
but have as ypt to meet the Red
! shirt mallet-wielders.
I Stanford may also become a mem
! ber of a polo circuit being planned
I by San Francisco enthusiasts. Invi
) tations have been mailed to repre
! sentatives of 10 teams in this dis
j trict to discuss the matter at a
' luncheon at the Palace Hotel on
I March 5.
It is proposed to play a round
j robin of games, the final winner to
be awarded' a huge trophy. Each
team would pay a share of the ex
penses involved, the remainder to
be subscribed by interested merch
ants.
The quartets proposed for mem
bership in the loop are Stanford,
San Francisco, Oakland, Menlo,
Presidio, Stockton, Sacramento,
Napa" Valley, and two from the Half
i Moon Bay district.
