## Interest Today Centers In Dashes, 440, Mile; Marks May Fall 
### 
Unless weather conditions inter
fere, Coach Dink Templeton will
put his track men through the
regular Friday squad competition
this afternoon at the Oval, the last
practice event before the Indian
varsity makes its 1931 debut against
the Olympic Club next Saturday.
Performances on the cinder path
have been so remarkable this sea
sou that almost anything may hap
pen without startling track follow
ers when Templeton's runners vie
with each other.
Interest this afternoon will center
in the dashes, the 440, and the mile.
At last week's interclass meet Les
Hables ran the century in 9.7 sec
onds, finishing just ahead of Lom
bardi and Dyer, who will be strug
gling for first contact with the tape
again today.
Aside from the duel between
Eastman and Ike Hables, which Is
almost certain to be close, specta
tors will watch the 440 from the
standpoint of the stop watch, as
Stanford's quarter-milers endanger
existing records every time they
compete.
In the mile the efforts of Brown
and Storm should be interesting.
These two men have been neck and
neck around the Oval all season,
and although Brown has won the
last few races, Storm is never to be
seen far in his wake.
