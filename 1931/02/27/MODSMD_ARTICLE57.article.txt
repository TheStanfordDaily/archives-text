# DEBATE DECISIONS ARGUED BY COACH OF FORENSIC TEAM
## Card Debaters Will Meet Banking Institute In Tilt Wednesday 
### 
Professor J. G. Emerson, head de
bating coach, gave his opinion yes
terday on the controversial subject
of decision vs. non-decision debat
ing.

"We have found at Stanford that
the best results are obtained from
non-decision debates, with an oc
casional decision debate for variety.
A non-decision debate frees the de
baters, so that they are more in
teresting and less severe toward
their opponents."
Emerson feels that a decision
tends to make the debate more
stilted, and to contain more dry
facts and statistics and less humor.
The desire to win, l\e says, often
makes for an uninteresting treat
ment of the subject.
Joffre Debate
The head debating coach pointed
out that the Joffre Medal will be
awarded as the result of a decision
debate. In April of each year three
men from Stanford debate three
representatives of the University of
California, the best speaker of the
six in the opinion of the judges
being awarded the Joffre Medal.
The team whose member wins the
medal automatically wins the de
bate, the California team having
won last year.
Stanford will take the affirmative
in a debate next Wednesday against
the American Institute of Banking,
San Francisco Branch, on the sub
ject, "Resolved, that the nations
should adopt a policy, of free trade."
Arrangements have been made
for a two- or three-debate series,
the second debate to be on the sub
ject of chain stores. Stanford will
be represented by three men in each
debate. Coach Leland T. Chapin has
not selected the teams yet.
