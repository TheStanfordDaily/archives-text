# MANY EDITORS GRADUATED "BY REQUEST"
## Degree Awarded for Story of Drinking at Stanford OUSTED JOURNALIST CHEERED ON RETURN 
### SHANNON ALLEN 
Among the well-known figures
whose editorial over-activity has
caused them to be graduated from
Stanford "by request" is the late
Holbrook Blinn, one of the most
famous of all American actors.
Blinn was editor of the "Sequoia,"
a publication devoted to the promo
tion of literature, but now long
passed into limbo. His denouement
came after he published a supple
ment to the paper which contained
the picture of a damsel in a state
of extreme deshabille.
Drinking Yarn "Dinged"
An article entitled "Drinking at
Stanford, by a Stanford Woman,"
and a scurrilous epic written around
the subject of David and Bethsheba,
earned the degree of "request" for
one Smith, a later editor of that in
famous publication.
A few years later he was chosen
from San Francisco business men
as an "alumnus" to escort promi
nent navy officers on a tour of the
Stanford campus.

I Smith, impeccably attired in
] sponge-cloth trousers and cut-away
I coat, accompanied the officers in a
1 ileet of open busses up Palm Drive
; between two lar.es of madly cheer
ing students, doffing his topper
grandiloquently.
Editor Returns
i However, one editor of The Daily
; returned in a more orthodox man
ner to add the degree of B.A. to
that of "request." Back in the days
I of '06 student affairs were con
j trolled by a board of faculty mem
bers. This board decided to appoint
i Encina sponsors who would receive
| free board and room in return for
I curbing the boisterousness of the
1 hall inmates.
| The Daily editor announced that
jhe would print the names of all
i sponsors so appointed. An hour
j later his office was swamped with
resigning sponsors.
The affair eventually resulted in
j the transfer to student conti'ol, and
i the return of the expelled editor to
j resume his interrupted studies.
