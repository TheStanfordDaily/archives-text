### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 26. (/P) â€”
Spurred by offers of help from
newspaper comrades all over the
United States and in Europe, the
men and women of the New York
World strove deseperately today to
preserve the paper of Joseph Pulit
zer.
The 2,876 employees of the Morn
ing, Evening, and Sunday World
battled against time and a surro
gate's impending decision to get
into shape a money offer for the
paper which would avert its acqui
sition by the Scripps-Howard in
terests and its merging with the
New York Evening Telegram.
