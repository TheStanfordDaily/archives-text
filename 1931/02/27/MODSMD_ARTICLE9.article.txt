# SEQUOIA DOWNS EL CAMPO FIVE TO WIN CROWN
## Art Zuger Breaks Scoring Record For Year In Theta Chi Game 
### 
Sequoia I, 32—El Campo, 8
Theta Chi, 45 —Kappa Sigma, 4
El Capitan, 23—Phi Sigma Kappa,
8
Encina V vs. Phi Gam's (double
default)
By Michael Crofoot
Sequoia I's quintet, defeating the
hitherto unbeaten El Campo team,
32-8, won their fifth straight game,
the championship of league IV, and
their way into the playoffs for the
1931 school basketball title last night
in the Pavilion. '
Art Zuger of Theta Chi provided
the other feature of the evening by
breaking this year's intramural
scoring record with 26 points as his
team downed Kappa Sigma 45-4.
Capitan Keeps Lead
Defeating Phi Sigma Kappa, 23-8,
in the playoff of a postponed con
test, El Capitan retained their joint
leadership of league VII along with
Breakers, whom they meet for the
title next week. The other sched
uled contest of the evening was a
double default, neither Phi Gamma
Delta nor Encina V putting in an
appearance.
Despite the fact that Sequoia I's
great forward trio has been broken
up by the withdrawal from school
of Harrison, the other two members
of the trio, Palmberg and Getts gave
their team an easy victory over El
Campo by their fine all-around per
formances. Palmberg accounted for
15 points, all of them made under
difficult circumstances, while Getts
made 7, besides outjumping his tal
ler opponent at center, playing an
important part in Sequoia's passing
attack, and doing well on defense.
Sequoia Stars Clever
Almost all the buckets made by
this star duo were tapped or batted
in from under the basket from the
middle of a ring of Campo oppon
ents. Fine timing, clever shooting,
opportune position play, and above
all continual trying enabled Palm
berg and Getts to sink these seem
ingly impossible shots.
As for Zuger's record breaking
performance, it required besides a
good eye and fine floor work a
good feeder, and weak opposition.
In Whit Wright and Howe, he had
two of the best; in Kappa Sigma, one
of the worst. Results: a new season
record of 13 field goals.

El Capitan, 23—Phi Sigma Kappa,
8
Encina V vs. Phi Gam's (double
default)
By Michael Crofoot
Sequoia I's quintet, defeating the
hitherto unbeaten El Campo team,
32-8, won their fifth straight game,
the championship of league IV, and
their way into the playoffs for the
1931 school basketball title last night
in the Pavilion. '
Art Zuger of Theta Chi provided
the other feature of the evening by
breaking this year's intramural
scoring record with 26 points as his
team downed Kappa Sigma 45-4.
Capitan Keeps Lead
Defeating Phi Sigma Kappa, 23-8,
in the playoff of a postponed con
test, El Capitan retained their joint
leadership of league VII along with
Breakers, whom they meet for the
title next week. The other sched
uled contest of the evening was a
double default, neither Phi Gamma
Delta nor Encina V putting in an
appearance.
Despite the fact that Sequoia I's
great forward trio has been broken
up by the withdrawal from school
of Harrison, the other two members
of the trio, Palmberg and Getts gave
their team an easy victory over El
Campo by their fine all-around per
formances. Palmberg accounted for
15 points, all of them made under
difficult circumstances, while Getts
made 7, besides outjumping his tal
ler opponent at center, playing an
important part in Sequoia's passing
attack, and doing well on defense.
Sequoia Stars Clever
Almost all the buckets made by
this star duo were tapped or batted
in from under the basket from the
middle of a ring of Campo oppon
ents. Fine timing, clever shooting,
opportune position play, and above
all continual trying enabled Palm
berg and Getts to sink these seem
ingly impossible shots.
As for Zuger's record breaking
performance, it required besides a
good eye and fine floor work a
good feeder, and weak opposition.
In Whit Wright and Howe, he had
two of the best; in Kappa Sigma, one
of the worst. Results: a new season
record of 13 field goals.
