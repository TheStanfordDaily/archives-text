# INDIAN WINNING STREAK SOARS IN TWIN TILTS
## Varsity Nine fakes Double Header From Santa Clara 8-7, 6-0 JOHNSON PITCHES WIN Philippi Hits Homer To Pull First Game From Fire 
### Francis Lloyd 
It's a great system.
The more games the Stanford
baseball team plays the more games
they win. The Indians took on the
Broncos in a double-header last
Saturday to bring their Conference
wins to five by taking both tilts to
the cheerful refrain of 8-7 and 0-0.
Shades of Ernie Nevers and his con
venient home runs were enacted in
the nerve-tingling ninth inning
finish of Wolter's men in the first
game. Trailing by two runs the Red
shirts started the last half of the
ninth with a walk by Dykes John
son, a perfect bunt by Spud Hardy,
both men advancing > a base on an
error. With the count one and one
on Vince Philippi, the Cardinal sec
ond sackcr slashed one of O'Daniels'
offerings for a home run over center
to win the game for Stanford.
Johnson Stars in Second
The rhythmic-like pitching of
Dan Johnson, Woltex - 's star pitcher,
kept the Broncos in a very subdued
frame of mind for the duration of
the seven innings of the second
game. The Indian hitters collected
six hits which were also good for
six runs to give Johnson a com
fortable lead to work on. Being
rather too much of a sure thing to
be interesting, the second game of
fered only one bit of news—the ap
pearance of Rudy Rintala in the
regular lineup.
An unbelievably sour fourth in
ning in the first game put the Car
dinals in the hole 7-2. Santa Clara,
by amassing six hits and with the
aid of three errors, chalked up
seven runs in the one inning. Frank
Milsap, who l'eplaced Vard Loomis
during the progress of this night
marish performance, was able to
hold the Broncs scoreless for the
remainder of the game, enabling the
Indians to profit by their last-ditch
rally.
Philippi Stars
Getting a hit in every inning when
the Indians scored during the after
noon, Vince Philippi was the man
who "came through" to gladden the
hearts of Stanford fans. Philippi got
four out of eight hits in the two
Barnes and every one of them
knocked in runs. Rintala's towering
hit to deep center was a prophecy
of better times for Wolter's men
when the great Finn begins straight-
ening them out.
Except for one disastrous inning,
the fielding and general heads-up
playing of the Cardinals was ex
ceedingly satisfactory. A fast dou
ble play in the third frame of the
second game, Delmas to Philippi to
Hardy, cleared the paths of a few
unnecessary Santa Clara men. A
perfect squeeze play, with Hardy
running and Hunken laying down
a bunt, added one more run for
Stanford in the closing tilt.

Milsap, who l'eplaced Vard Loomis
during the progress of this night
marish performance, was able to
hold the Broncs scoreless for the
remainder of the game, enabling the
Indians to profit by their last-ditch
rally.
Philippi Stars
Getting a hit in every inning when
the Indians scored during the after
noon, Vince Philippi was the man
who "came through" to gladden the
hearts of Stanford fans. Philippi got
four out of eight hits in the two
Barnes and every one of them
knocked in runs. Rintala's towering
hit to deep center was a prophecy
of better times for Wolter's men
when the great Finn begins straight-
ening them out.
Except for one disastrous inning,
the fielding and general heads-up
playing of the Cardinals was ex
ceedingly satisfactory. A fast dou
ble play in the third frame of the
second game, Delmas to Philippi to
Hardy, cleared the paths of a few
unnecessary Santa Clara men. A
perfect squeeze play, with Hardy
running and Hunken laying down
a bunt, added one more run for
Stanford in the closing tilt.

It's a great system.
The more games the Stanford
baseball team plays the more games
they win. The Indians took on the
Broncos in a double-header last
Saturday to bring their Conference
wins to five by taking both tilts to
the cheerful refrain of 8-7 and 0-0.
Shades of Ernie Nevers and his con
venient home runs were enacted in
the nerve-tingling ninth inning
finish of Wolter's men in the first
game. Trailing by two runs the Red
shirts started the last half of the
ninth with a walk by Dykes John
son, a perfect bunt by Spud Hardy,
both men advancing > a base on an
error. With the count one and one
on Vince Philippi, the Cardinal sec

It's a great system.
The more games the Stanford
baseball team plays the more games
they win. The Indians took on the
Broncos in a double-header last
Saturday to bring their Conference
wins to five by taking both tilts to
the cheerful refrain of 8-7 and 0-0.
Shades of Ernie Nevers and his con
venient home runs were enacted in
the nerve-tingling ninth inning
finish of Wolter's men in the first
game. Trailing by two runs the Red
shirts started the last half of the
ninth with a walk by Dykes John
son, a perfect bunt by Spud Hardy,
both men advancing > a base on an
error. With the count one and one
on Vince Philippi, the Cardinal sec
ond sackcr slashed one of O'Daniels'
offerings for a home run over center
to win the game for Stanford.
Johnson Stars in Second
The rhythmic-like pitching of
Dan Johnson, Woltex - 's star pitcher,
kept the Broncos in a very subdued
frame of mind for the duration of
the seven innings of the second
game. The Indian hitters collected
six hits which were also good for
six runs to give Johnson a com
fortable lead to work on. Being
rather too much of a sure thing to
be interesting, the second game of
fered only one bit of news—the ap
pearance of Rudy Rintala in the
regular lineup.
An unbelievably sour fourth in
ning in the first game put the Car
dinals in the hole 7-2. Santa Clara,
by amassing six hits and with the
aid of three errors, chalked up
seven runs in the one inning. Frank
Milsap, who l'eplaced Vard Loomis
during the progress of this night
marish performance, was able to
hold the Broncs scoreless for the
remainder of the game, enabling the
Indians to profit by their last-ditch
rally.
Philippi Stars
Getting a hit in every inning when
the Indians scored during the after
noon, Vince Philippi was the man
who "came through" to gladden the
hearts of Stanford fans. Philippi got
four out of eight hits in the two
Barnes and every one of them
knocked in runs. Rintala's towering
hit to deep center was a prophecy
