# INDIAN WINNING STREAK SOARS IN TWIN TILTS
## Varsity Nine fakes Double Header From Santa Clara 8-7, 6-0 JOHNSON PITCHES WIN Philippi Hits Homer To Pull First Game From Fire

It's a great system.
The more games the Stanford
baseball team plays the more games
they win. The Indians took on the
Broncos in a double-header last
Saturday to bring their Conference
wins to five by taking both tilts to
the cheerful refrain of 8-7 and 0-0.
Shades of Ernie Nevers and his con
venient home runs were enacted in
the nerve-tingling ninth inning
finish of Wolter's men in the first
game. Trailing by two runs the Red

by amassing six hits and with the
aid of three errors, chalked up
seven runs in the one inning. Frank
Milsap, who l'eplaced Vard Loomis
during the progress of this night
marish performance, was able to
hold the Broncs scoreless for the
remainder of the game, enabling the
Indians to profit by their last-ditch
rally.
Philippi Stars
Getting a hit in every inning when
the Indians scored during the after
noon, Vince Philippi was the man
who "came through" to gladden the
hearts of Stanford fans. Philippi got
four out of eight hits in the two
Barnes and every one of them
knocked in runs. Rintala's towering
hit to deep center was a prophecy
of better times for Wolter's men
