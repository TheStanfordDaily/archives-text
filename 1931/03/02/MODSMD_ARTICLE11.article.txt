Acting willi a vigor and intelligence that should
ever be a credit to Stanford student government,
the Men's and Women's Councils met together Fri
day and gave an emphatic, affirmative answer to
the question as to "whether or not they were going
to enforce the Honor Code. Not only did they agree
on a policy of strict enforcement of the Code, but
in addition they legislated in such a way as to guar
antee more surely the success of their program.
The Councils, convinced that violations of the
Code demand severe punishment, ruled: (1) That
suspension from the University for three quarters
be the minimum penalty for breaking the Code;
(2) that permanent expulsion from the University
be the maximum penalty and be automatic in cases
of second convicted violations; and (,'i) that names
of all students expelled be published.
For years the Councils have talked; The Daily
lias ranted; the students have railed; and faculty
members have complained—all about the Honor
Code. And nothing has come of it, because it has
been just talk. But now the Councils have acted,
and vigorously, with the intention of making the
Honor Code an active, working force in Stanford
student life. They have laid down a severe mini
mum penalty of three quarters suspension for or
dinary violations and a maximum penalty of per
manent expulsion for flagrant offenses. Names of
the latter violators, whose conduct marks them as
"ringers" who don't belong at Stanford, will be
published.
The Councils, on whose aggressiveness and
judgment the success of the Code is dependent,
have acted wisely and well in declaring for rigid
enforcement.
It is now up to the students to prove, by indi
vidual observance, that they deserve to have the
Honor Code.
