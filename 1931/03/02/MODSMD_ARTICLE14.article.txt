Journeying from their adobe
dwellings in New Mexico, eight Zia
and Pueblo Indians have arrived to
demonstrate their art crafts at the
Stanford galleries for three days be
ginning tomorrow.]
These Indians taave never been
more than 100 miles away from
their villages before. Yesterday, a
solemn committee in gay serapes,
they walked around the Quad while
their crafts materials were being
set up in the gallery under the
supervision of Pedro Lemos, mu
seum director, through whose ar
rangement the Indians were brought
to .Stanford.
Art To Be Displayed
Inside the art gallery, open during
yesterday's preparation, Indian blan
kets, baskets, paintings, pottery,
jewelry, lay scattered in confusion,
ready for mounting.
Sand painting in a large squared
area over the floor heralds a pic
turesque and alien artistry. Heavy
sticks, brought in bundles from New
Mexico, are to be lashed together
into a loom on which the Indian
women and an Indian child will
weave rugs.
Artist Will Paint
Ma-Pc-We, noted Indian artist
whose water colors have brought
him a well-deserved reputation for
excellence, is to paint. Oils on In
dian subjects by Nils Hognar also
will be on exhibit.
