# G.O.P. Majority Sure To Re-Elect Hoover-Pringle
## 
### WILLIAM RUBENS 
Spiced with interesting anecdotes
concerning the chief executive in
Washington, D.C., came the opinion
yesterday from Henry F. Pringle,
newspaperman and biographer notec!
for his uncanny prognostications of
political events, that depression or
no depression and mistakes or no
mistakes, Herbert Hoover, '95, would
be nominated in 1932 by the Repub
lican party to succeed himself as
President of the United States of
America.
Coming from an ardent A1 Smith
for-President supporter in 1928 and
biographer in 1930 ("The Intimate
Biography of A1 Smith"), Pringle's
statement of opinion on Hoover's
re-election chances was doubly in
teresting.
He declared that the voters in 1932
would favor Hoover, not because of

any accomplishments or errors on
the part of the present administra
tion, but simply because Hoover was
the head of the Grand Old Party.
Since the majority of the country's
electorate is Republican, Pringle be
lieves that, even if the electorate
thinks the present administration is
not. accomplishing as much as it
should, the voters also feel that the
Democrats, if given a chance, would
do even worse.
Pringle is sojourning in Menlo
1 Park at present preparing a new
: biography on Theodore Roosevelt,
j The former Washington correspond
-1 cut is recognized as an authority on
! political science and recently spoke
before the Stanford chapter of Pi
! Sigma Alpha, national honorary po
i litical Science fraternity, on the
subject, "Politicians and the Press."
