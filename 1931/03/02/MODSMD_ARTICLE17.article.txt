# LOCAL ACTORS WIN HONORS IN ROYAL FAMILY
## Beede, Keho, Carter Share Honors Of Piece; Set Well-Planned 
### Staff Reviewer 
Harold Helvenston scored another
unquestioned success in "The Royal
J Family," a satirical comedy by
George S. Kaufman and Edna Fer
ber presented Friday night in the
| Assembly Hall.
Sharing the mythical honors of
1 the "stars" of the play were Ruth
; Beede as Julia, Katherine Keho as
Fanny, and Nelson Carter as Tony
i Cavendish. They pulled the show
up from being just another good
production to make it an outstand
ing campus triumph.
Carter Excellent
Nelson Carter undoubtedly con
tributed the most to the audience's
enjoyment. He played his role with
such seeming pleasure and abandon
that he did not appear to be over
acting. Often bringing back with a
bang the waning interest of the
| spectators, he won hands at praci
cally every entrance and exit.
Surprising those who had seen
I him only in "Football Gaieties" and
i in Junior Operas, Carter displayed
| ability to portray the nonchalant,
riotous Tony, and to maintain with
only a few let-downs the character
j ization.
Beede's Best Work
Julia, the accomplished actress un
; selfishly giving up her own wishes
for those of the ones she loves, is
; the best work Ruth Beede has done
! here. She held the enthusiasm of
; the play high by her fine interpre
tation of the role, termed by many
' as the counterpart of Ethel Barry
; more. She was pleasingly consistent
and put herself entirely into her
; part-
Not only with her own excellent
acting was she indispensable to the
I success of the play, but also by the
! clever way she saved several awk
ward pauses when other actors
i missed cues.
Keho in Character
Katherine Keho's performance
was again a triumph. In the play's
most difficult role, faced with the
task of talking and acting like an
! old woman, she succeeded for the
most part in keeping entirely in
| character.
Several of her scenes were espe
! daily outstanding. Among them
was that following the fencing scene
between Tony and Julia's trainer
i when she mounted the staircase and
I showed how Aubrey Cavendish had
fenced in the "good old days."
Hall Fits Role
As Gwen Cavendish, Carolyn Hall
filled her role adequately. She is
not sure of herself on the stage and
, showed an amateurish tendency to
always put her hands on the backs
of chairs. Her entrances were her
i best "bits."
Virginia Ingrim, playing her first
role on the local stage, caught the
spirit of her part well. She, too,
showed a lack of stage experience,
but if she can do this well in her
debut, she should go far in campus
di-amatics.
Minor Parts
Max Kolliner played his part as
the family manager and friend ade
quately. Ernest Mcndenhall looked
his part to perfection, and his lines,
"you get your name in electric
lights, then poof, the fuse blows out
and where are you?" brought down
the house.
Jack HinclifTe could have put
more spirit into his role and played
up to Kitty more effectively. The
two well-trained servants were
played by Lucille Morgan and Bon
Kagan.
An attractive and well-planned
set, particularly outstanding laecause
of its curved staircase, helped to
bring out the atmosphere of the
harum-scarum theatrical family.

and put herself entirely into her
; part-
Not only with her own excellent
acting was she indispensable to the
I success of the play, but also by the
! clever way she saved several awk
ward pauses when other actors
i missed cues.
Keho in Character
Katherine Keho's performance
was again a triumph. In the play's
most difficult role, faced with the
task of talking and acting like an
! old woman, she succeeded for the
most part in keeping entirely in
| character.
Several of her scenes were espe
! daily outstanding. Among them
was that following the fencing scene
between Tony and Julia's trainer
i when she mounted the staircase and
I showed how Aubrey Cavendish had
fenced in the "good old days."
Hall Fits Role
As Gwen Cavendish, Carolyn Hall
filled her role adequately. She is
not sure of herself on the stage and
, showed an amateurish tendency to
always put her hands on the backs
of chairs. Her entrances were her
i best "bits."
Virginia Ingrim, playing her first
role on the local stage, caught the
spirit of her part well. She, too,
showed a lack of stage experience,
but if she can do this well in her
debut, she should go far in campus
di-amatics.
Minor Parts
Max Kolliner played his part as
the family manager and friend ade
quately. Ernest Mcndenhall looked
his part to perfection, and his lines,
"you get your name in electric
lights, then poof, the fuse blows out
and where are you?" brought down
the house.
Jack HinclifTe could have put
more spirit into his role and played
up to Kitty more effectively. The
two well-trained servants were
played by Lucille Morgan and Bon
Kagan.
An attractive and well-planned
set, particularly outstanding laecause
of its curved staircase, helped to
bring out the atmosphere of the
harum-scarum theatrical family.
Harold Helvenston scored another
unquestioned success in "The Royal
J Family," a satirical comedy by
George S. Kaufman and Edna Fer
ber presented Friday night in the
| Assembly Hall.
Sharing the mythical honors of
1 the "stars" of the play were Ruth
; Beede as Julia, Katherine Keho as
Fanny, and Nelson Carter as Tony
i Cavendish. They pulled the show
up from being just another good
production to make it an outstand
ing campus triumph.
Carter Excellent
Nelson Carter undoubtedly con
tributed the most to the audience's
enjoyment. He played his role with
such seeming pleasure and abandon
that he did not appear to be over
acting. Often bringing back with a
bang the waning interest of the
| spectators, he won hands at praci
cally every entrance and exit.
Surprising those who had seen
I him only in "Football Gaieties" and
i in Junior Operas, Carter displayed
| ability to portray the nonchalant,
riotous Tony, and to maintain with
only a few let-downs the character
j ization.
Beede's Best Work
Julia, the accomplished actress un
; selfishly giving up her own wishes
for those of the ones she loves, is
; the best work Ruth Beede has done
! here. She held the enthusiasm of
; the play high by her fine interpre
tation of the role, termed by many
' as the counterpart of Ethel Barry
; more. She was pleasingly consistent
and put herself entirely into her
