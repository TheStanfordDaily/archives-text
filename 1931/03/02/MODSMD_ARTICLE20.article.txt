# Three Officials Voice Approval Of Code Action
## Opinions Stated By Culver, Yost, And Pike 
### 
Complete approval of the action
taken by Men's and Women's Coun
: cils at a joint session Friday, pro
viding for more stringent punish
| ment of Honor Code violators, was
J voiced by three outstanding Stan
ford officials yesterday.
Dean of Men George B. Culver,
Dean of Women Mary Yost, and
A.S.S.U. President Tom Pike all ex
pressed approval.
Dean Culver: "Any legislation is
' worthwhile that discourages the
cheater in his practices and eventu
ally removes him from the student
' body if he fails to become discour
aged. Toleration gives the cheater
his opportunity. All he craves is to
! be let alone. With cheaters elimi
nated, the honest student has a fair
and even chance for competition.
"The ultimate aim should not be,
of course, so much concerned with
punishment as with the develop
ment of a. reasonable standard of
honesty and fairness. This would
make cheating the resort only of
the rather rare type that steals
whenever a favorable opportunity
presents itself. It is no proper func
tion of an educational institution to
tolerate dishonesty, but the morally
weak can frequently be bolstered
up and greatly strengthened by as
sociation and companionship with
those who have a wholesome and
active dislike for dishonesty."
j Dean Yost: "It seems to me that
! the councils have taken the only
action possible under the circum
stances. I shall be very glad to see
this go into effect. It will be diffi
j cult, but it is the only thing that
will make the students realize what
the Honor Code is."
Pike: "I don't believe we can go
i too far in this direction. With the
I effects that will result from this
action, we should have a return to
: normalcy within a year or two."
1 Asked if he thought convictions
j would be more difficult to obtain
under the new plan, Pike said, ' Not
j this year, at any rate. Possibly in
j future councils, but that is hypo
thetical."
