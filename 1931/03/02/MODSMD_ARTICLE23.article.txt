# Total Expulsion From University To Be Code Fine
## Minimum Punishment For Cheating To Be Suspension For Three Quarters; Measures To Take Effect In Cases Beginning This Morning COUNCILS VOTE FOR PUBLICATION OF NAMES Decisions Made at Joint Meeting of Men's and Women's Councils; Hoped That Action Will Stop Violations 
### 
/X>MPLETE expulsion from the University or a minimum penalty of
suspension for three quarters for violation of the Honor Code and
publication of the names of students expelled were measures of enforce
ment which won an affirmative vote at a joint meeting of Men's and
Women's Councils held Friday afternoon. At the end of a discussion
lasting more than two hours, the three proposals adopted were:
(1) The maximum penalty for the first convicted violation of the
Honor Code, the giving or receiving of aid in examinations, shall be
expulsion from the University; the minimum penalty shall be suspension
for three quarters. These penalties are to be levied at the discretion of

<®Men's and Women's Councils. There
j shall be automatic expulsion for the
; second convicted violation.
| (2) The names of those persons
! expelled from the University for
violation of the Honor Code shall
! be published.
(3) It shall be recommended to
the Executive Committee that a
| statement of the Code and its cn
| forcement shall be sent to all new
i students entering the University.
Apply Immediately
The first two of these measures
; should apply to all cases beginning
' with this morning and their pub
! lication in the Daily, it was decided.
In the case of suspension of vio
lators, the Councils agreed that if
the cheating is done before finals,
all credit for that quarter will be
! withheld, and that quarter will be
1 considered one of the three of the
period of suspension. However, if
' the violation occurs during final ex-
I aminations, no credit will be given
| for the course in which the cheat
: ing has been done and the period
; of suspension will last for the three
j quarters following.
Debate on Publicity
Discussion centered on whether
; or not the names of all convicted
violators of the Code, either sus
pended or expelled, should be pub
lished. A plurality ruled the pub
lication of all names, including those
of suspended students, too sevore a
penalty. The old system of doling
j out hours of work at the Convale
scent Home was regarded as obso
lete.
This year has been the first in
which Men's and Women's Councils
have decided on a co-operative pol
icy. Members of Men's Council pres
ent Friday were: Guido Caglieri
(chairman), Paul Speegle, Warner
Edmonds, Milton Hand, and Ken
neth Mcßae. Members of Women's
Council there were: Bctly Alden
(chairman), Betty Clarke, Sarah
Grant, Barbara Beach Thompson,
and Miriam Strout.
