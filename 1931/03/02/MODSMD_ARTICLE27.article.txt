# WASHINGTON GOING BACKWARDS
## 
### 
Al the University of Washington, where the dean of the
law school now reigns supreme over Columns, the campus
humor magazine, the W'aslti tu/ton Daily soon will be lifted
from student control. Beginning August 1, the editorial
control of the Daiti/ will he delegated to the school ot jour
nalism faculty. Curiously enough, the student management
was relinquished by the student body's own board of con-
I rol.

The ostensible excuse for this move was "to secure the
Daily as a laboratory school for journalism students." At
Stanford, the Stan roan Daii.v offers laboratory experience
to ;iil University students, registered in journalism courses
or not. It offers adequate practice for all who desire it and
do capable work; provision is made for credit in journal
ism units for the proper amount of intelligent effort.
Most important, Stanford students have a campus news
paper unmuzzled by any kind of faculty supervision. The
Washington plan, offering no more advantage to journal
ism students than the Stanford arrangement, is another
step, and a regrettable one, in the extension of a tight fac
ulty grip over student expression.
