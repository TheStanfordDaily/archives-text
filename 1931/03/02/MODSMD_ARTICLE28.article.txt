# A 						VICTORY FOR FREE SPEECH
## 
### 
A victory in the fundamental cause of free speech and
the proper criticism of incompetent or derelict public offi
cials was won last week in a decision of the California
supreme court. The case involved the alleged contempt
of court of the Los Aiujeles Record. The newspaper had
maintained that the judge who was to try the case was
prejudiced; this the judge denied, asserting that he and he
alone had the authority to decide his own prejudice.
The supreme court order recognized the distinction be
tween "constructive" contempt cumulative in point of
time and occurring outside the jurisdiction of the court
;is opposed to direct contempt, committed within the court
proper and subject to summary disposition by the trial
judge.
The effect of tiiis decision is of far-reaching importance,
setting a precedent which will act as a safeguard of free
dom of speech and of the press in California. Henceforth,
no judge in this stale will attempt to decide the nature of
his own emotional complexes when he is charged with
prejudice in a contempt of court case based upon acts not
committed in his own court. Henceforth, California citi
zens, through their newspapers and otherwise, may criti
cize incompetent or corrupt judges and court officials as
they may criticize other public officials without fear of a
biased judge's snap decision on his own prejudice, if they
be charged with contempt.
In the stale of Indiana the same end is being sought by
the alumni chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, professional news
papermen's fraternity, at the t Diversity of Indiana. The
group has drawn up for presentation to the stale legislature
;i bill which would have the same effect in Indiana which
the supreme court decision now has in California. The
proposed law will, when enacted, make it unlawful for any
trial judge, in a contempt case involving the commission
of acts outside the court proper, to pass upon his own
prejudice.
