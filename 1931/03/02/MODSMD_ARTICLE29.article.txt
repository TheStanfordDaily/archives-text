Today's campus opinion column contains another com
plaint against the inadequate traflic controls :il the inter
section of Palm Drive and University Avenue with the
Highway. So many have been the accidents and near
accidents at this dangerous crossing that requests for ac

For several months the C.ity of Palo Alto has had a
committee investigating the situation with the view of
installing a system of IraOic signals-. A definite announce
ment concerning traflic regulation at this crossing is ex
pected soon. It is to he hoped that etl'eetive controls will
he shortly installed.

The Dui.y this morning wishes to congratulate l.'i new
members of its editorial stall, who begin their campus re
porting today. They are: A. L. Avnesworth, Hill C.ole, Klla
mae Dodds, Don Douglass, .leanette Gould, S. J. Graham,
Jean Hay, Donald McKean, Jack Peat, William Proctor,
Kvcrett Hoss, James Sandoe, and Margaret Stuart.
