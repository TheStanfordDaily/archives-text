CHICAGO CIVIC OPERA COM
PANY —At the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium.
Starring the internationally fam
ous artists, Tito Schipa, Claudia
Muzio, and John Charles Thomas,
the Chicago Civic Opera Company
opens its San Francisco engagement
tonight with y performance of
Verdi's popular "La Traviata" at the
Civic Auditorium.
The remainder of the repertoire
consists of Wagner's "Die Wul
kuere," a double attraction, "Caval
leria Rusticana" and "I Pagliacci,"
Donizetti's "Lucia," Verdi's "Aida"
arid "Rigoletto," and Richard
Strauss's "Dor Rosenkavalier,"
which will be presented on March
7 for the first time in the West.
L Other favorite artists who are in-
I eluded in the company of 325 per
sons are Margherita Salvi, Frida
Leider, Maria Olszewska, Alexander
Kipnis, and Charles Marshall. A full
j symphony orchestra, a well-trained
i chorus, and three conductors, Ro
berto Moranzoni, Emil Cooper, and
j Frank St. Leger, insure the success
of the company's current season.
—V. R.

THE EASIEST WAY—At The New
Stanford Theatre.
Decidedly worth seeing. Con
stance Bennett and Adolphe Men
jou give such stellar performances
that the occasional banalities of the
picture are glossed over. Anita Page,
for a change, has a role that suits

i her—that of a sweet, domestic little
1 woman, who marries a poor but
honest man, stays at home and takes
| care of a baby.
| Constance is the erring and beau
| tiful sister who chooses to take the
primrose path, and enjoys it, until
j she meets a young newspaperman
j and then it is the old story of "can
> a woman escape from her past'.'"
i Except for the sop to sentimental
! ity thrown in at the end of the
; show, the plot has dramatic sophis
! tication, and the action moves very
j fast. The realism of the opening
j scenes is interesting, if hardly com
fortable. —M. L. R.
VIENNESE NIGHTS—At the Var
-1 sity Theatre.
i What would have been considered
: a fair musical production in 1925) is
j perilously close to a dud in 1931.
Nothing shows more clearly the
I change in motion picture technique
! since those first frenzied days when
| Iho screen first found its voice than
| "Viennese Nights," produced for
j Warner Bros, by Romberg and Ham
j merstein 11.
j Filmed last year and kept in the
! can until recently, it employes three
! devises totally abandoned this sea
j son by most major producers—all
j color, all-music, and costumes.
! Its one redeeming feature is the
j Romberg music, but even this is
! hardly up to the standard of the
j "Desert Song" and other of his stage
' productnons. —L- M. C.
