## WHY ABANDON THE GRADING SYSTEM? 
### 
The Editor, Sir: »
In the present stew about the
Honor Code the idea of dropjaing
our grading system and substituting
a plus-minus system has been sug
gested.
Perhaps it might be well before
accepting a decision in any direc
tion to inquire why there are grades
and to what uses they are put.
Dr. W. C. Eells of the Department
of Education made a complete sur
vey during 1925-26-27 of all the
writings on and investigations of
grading systems for the preceding
25 years and also a thorough in
vestigation of the grading system
existing at Stanford. The title of his
thesis is "College and University
Grading, with Special Reference to
Intelligence Tests."
Dr. Eells gathers that, though the
plus-minus system has been tried,
almost all investigators favor a
grading somewhat on the same
order as that in use here and only
offer improvements in its applica
tion.
While the greatest issue lies in
the grade system's effect on stu
dents, the pedagogical arguments
pro and con are questionable and
inadequate for either side, i.e., such
as the Honor Code, incentive to
work, etc.. The deciding factor
should lie in the administrative uses
of grades, Dr. Eells believes.
Some of these uses at Stanford
are: graduation requirements; by
the honor point system a person
may get low degree grades in some
courses and yet be eligible; credit
for extra entrance subjects is based
on quality of work done while at
Stanford; the amount of work a
student may take is limited by five
restrictions, all of which are based

The Editor, Sir:
Now that we are happy to see the j
erection of a gate at the entrance
to Palm Drive, a great many of us !
would certainly be tickled to see
some kind of signal or arterial stop |
system installed at the intersection
of Palm Drive and the Highway. ;
Since the first time 1 crossed that !
race track, the Highway, I have J
had sickening thoughts of one of
those speeding cars crashing into :
someone en route to or from the
campus.
Traffic comes by there so thick j
and fast that a driver has to pray
for a safe crossing and a mere
pedestrian has to run for his life, j
Highway travelers don't give the
almost-as-steady stream of traffic
to and from the campus an even
break. After making the arterial I
stop, you have all you can do to
accelerate across the highway fast
enough to get out of the way of the ,
onrushing cars. At night the matter j
is worse, for the crossing is not very !
evident, and' there are no lighted, !
conspicuous warning signs.
If you need the argument for
such a necessity forcefully impressed
upon your mind, you should ex
perience being smashed into broad- |

! on grades; eligibles for Independent

It might be noted with interest

j ing is in limited use at Stanford,
! particularly in some seminar courses

the Graduate School of Business,
i But it would seem that the prof

I tem of grading merely avoids fac

Are we going to scrap this useful

: self-debasement of cheating for bet

j It is my opinion that anyone
I who cheats acts upon the principle
I of the greatest result for the least
j effort. If so, substitution of the
j plus-minus grading system will just
, lower the scale. The cheater will

j methods he uses now.

side by a speeding car and feel
yourself and the parts of your car
being scattered in various direc
tions. Several of us bad such an
experience Saturday evening and
are thanking our lucky stars for
being alive.' Our driver made his
legal arterial stop and started across
the Highway. A car came bearing
down on us from far dov/n the road
in nothing flat and smashed into us
before we could even ofTer up a
prayer. The autoist evidently
thought he was on an open highway,
not being warned to the contrary
by lighted signs or signals, and did
not see our car in the dark as it
was turned sidewise to his.
Though nobody was hurt badly,
the smash didn't make for pleasant
dreams. If we had all been killed,
would anything have been done
about the situation? The state, city,
and University authorities have ex
changed a few letters and asked
the others to remedy the danger,
but nothing probably would have
come of it. Instead of haggling
about petty details, they all ought
to co-operate and decide definitely
to do something, and what's more—
do it.
Hoping a few more feel the same
way, Paul C. Aobersold.
