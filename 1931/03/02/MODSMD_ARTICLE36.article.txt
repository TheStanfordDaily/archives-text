# CABBAGES and Things . .

It seems to be spring. Not that
you hadn't noticed it, or that it was
exactly unexpected; but newspapers
are leaving out cross-word puzzles
to insert information from travel
bureaus and vacationing spots, and
the calendar says "March." It's here!
And no water to breed the mosquito
crop.
The boys on the sunken dia
mond and Ibo Paly High sand
lot and the Japanese Club lawn
are all having (ho same sort of
a struggle over third-baseman
and catcher's mils. Only the
Japanese boys are accurate, and
the Kappa Si 4s are s|>eedy. For
tunately, there are some others
on the campus who can and do
play baseball. Won two games
without even trying, this week
end, and we still have room to
laugh in.
â–  Surprising, isn't it, tho number of
people who decide to take up Geol
ogy as a life study, when field trips
to Hi'.lf Moon Bay are in order for
classwork? But ask the man who's
been on one about crab cocktails at
restaurants on the bay ....
