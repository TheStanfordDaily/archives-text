Robeson's popularity as a singer
i of spirituals and classical selections
has nowhere been greater than with
I the university audiences in the Uni- 1

Rachmaninoff the week before.

Rutgers College and studied law at
Columbia. He is a member of Phi

debater, and won his letter in four ,
major sportsâ€”football, baseball, bas
ketball, and track.
In 1917 he was chosen All-Ameri
can end by the sports writers, and
| was declared by Walter Camp to be j

trod the gridiron." At his gi'adua
