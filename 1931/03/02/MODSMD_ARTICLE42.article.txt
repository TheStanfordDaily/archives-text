This year, fans on the coast
seem to be waking up to the
fact that polo is an interesting
game to watch, and as a result
that pasture sport is gradually
gaining its due recognition on
these western slopes. Along with r
(lie general awakening of inter
est, collegiate competition is at
last coining into its own.
Until this year the college" polo
conference on the coast has con
sisted of only two teams, and the
schedule of the annual two-game
series between these rivals. To the
winner of this meeting has been
awarded the title of collegiate
champions, while the loser had an
undisputed claim to second place in
Ihe league.
However, the recently com
pleted arrangements for a Stan
ford-U.C'.L.A. match has ended
all this, and the possibility that
IJ.S.C. will soon he included on
the Indian schedule would indi
cate that before very long the
coast will have a real circuit.
If and when polo does become
more of a major sport among coast
colleges, Stanford is in a posilion
to bring glory to the Farm in an
other field. Due largely to the ef
forts of Coach Gordan, horsemen on
this campus are taking a lot of in
terest in the game and are building
up an organization that will keep
Stanford supplied with excellent
teams for years to come.
'Reluctant to drop the subject of
basketball sinct its rebirth at Ibis
institution, we would like to pre
sent a little more dope that has
come to light concerning the past
season. Upon the record of indi
vidual conference scoring, one lias
to read down but four names from
Ihe top to find that of Phil MofTatt,
who is credited with no less than
56 points. Phil certaintly developed
an uncanny eye for the bucket
without any warning whatsoever,
thereby proving himself to be the
'find" of the season. It wouldn't
surprise anybody next year if he
finished on top of the scoring heap.
Anyone glancing over the re
suits of the intcrclass golf tour
ney Saturday would begin lo
doubt that Stanford has one of
the greatest arrays of collegiate
talent in the country. In that
medal competition the scores of
varsity golfers ran way up into
the NO's and HQ's, while near-par
golf was expected from some of
the leaders. This proves nothing
against the ability of these
divot-diggers, but simply that
Stanford has one of the world's
toughest courses when the back
tees are in order.
As usual, the thrill of the Friday
rack meet was the duel between
jcs Hables and Hec Dyer in the
lash events. Incidentally, that time
f 9.7 which Hables turned in while
.eating Hec by less than a foot in
he hundred might just as well have
teen 9.(5 or even 9.5. Two of the
/atches which timed the sprint star
ecorded those figures, while the
hird showed the time which was
nnounced.
Reports coining from the
South indicate that Frank
Wyekofi, U.S.C.'s own Glendale
flash, is also showing very good
early season form. His 9.7 race
of last Friday may be the fore
cast to another record-breaking
year for the Southern California
sensation. However, it will have
to be record-breaking to crowd
the Indian pair out for a first
place in the century when the
Trojans and the Cardinals clash
again in that epic of all track
meets. â€”Crawford.
