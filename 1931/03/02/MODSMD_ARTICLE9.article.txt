# CHAPPIE OFFICIALS OUTLINE PLANS FOR NEW SPRING ISSUE
## 
### 
With everyone's fancy turning
lightly to spring, or something like
that* the Chaparral staff's fancy is
today turning to its Spring Issue, to
be out soon.
A colorful process engraved draw
ing by Thorington Putnam, depict
ing a touching scene somewhere in
the hills above the lake, will adorn
the cover. It is the first of this proc
ess in four years, and the fourth
ever printed by Chappie, according
to Burnell Gould, editor.
Other art work will be seen from
the pens of Berk Anthony, Mai Wil
liams, Frank Clough, and Bob
Churchill. Notable in the literary
copy is the lyric poem "No Can Do"
by Don Cameron, as well as the
usual drivel from Paul Lorton,
Dolph Winebrenner, and others.
Touching on the subject of track,
a major sport, and other pertinent
subjects, the far-reaching pens of
the Chappie staff will scratch out
new ideas on old subjects.
