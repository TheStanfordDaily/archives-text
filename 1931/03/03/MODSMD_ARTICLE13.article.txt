# SPRINT ACE TO RUN FOR WINGED "O"
## National Ruling Allows Hables To Race For Olympic Club 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Sprints .should hold the spotlight
of interest in Saturday's track meet
between the Indians and the Olympic
Club in the Stadium, for these events
will find Dink Templeton's two fore
most dash stars, Hec Dyer and Les
Hables, wearing rival colors. Hables,
who is ineligible on the Stanford
team until next quarter, will partici
pate for the clubmen.
Hables is eligible for the Winged
"O" squad under a recent national
ruling which states that collegiate
athletes may compete for clubs
whose colors they may wear in the
1932 Olympic Games. It was this
same ruling which permitted Stan
ford swimming stars to represent
the Olympic Club in water polo
last month.
Many Stars
On the San Francisco club's ros
ter Friday will be found the names
of many prominent amateur and
former collegiate track stars, among
whom are several Stanford athletes
of past years. Besides Hables, the
clubmen will enter Ed Granucci in
the century and 220.
Bill Storie, a former Indian quar
ter-miler who used to cover the
distance in 49.5 seconds, will be Ihe
club's entfy in the 440. John Young,
Oregon State, who is capable of the
excellent time of 1 minute 58 sec
onds, will compete in the half.
Carter in Mile
Harry Carter and Gereicke, for
mer Californians, will oppose
Brown and Storms of Stanford in
the mile. In the two-mile the Olym
pics will have Swede, Southern
California; Dobbs, California; and
Keegan, a prominent bay district
amateur distance runner.
Templeton's hurdlers should have
no easy time in beating out Young
of Cornell and Scott Morrison in
the barrier events. Ross Nichols,
former Stanford hurdler, will enter
the pole vault for .the club along
with Koblick, Southern California,
and Hulsman, Stanford.
Krenz' in Weights
Weight events will show how the
present Indian squad can compare
with last year's in that department,
for Captain Eric Krenz of the 1930
varsity will enter both the shot put
and discus for the Olympic Club.
His teammates will be John Taylor,
former Baylor star, A1 Forster of
Stanford, and Hal Dunker. Olsen
and Clem Friedman will toss the
javelin for the Club.

Kim Dyer and Virg Dowell, for
mer Stanford jumpers, will enter
the broad jump with Martin and
Kelley, making a quartet of leapers
whose past records have been bet
tered only by Arnie West of the
present varsity. Coggeshall, Fellmar,
and Nugent will be the Olympic
high jumpers.
