# Robeson Lauds College Contacts And Activities
## 
### CATHERINE SPAULDING 
Literally shoved into Ihe dressing
room by the mob thronging the
door, we stared astounded at the
figure of Paul Robeson who was
quietly autographing pictures,
evincing no remembrance of the
minute before when he left the
stage amid the cheers of an en
thusiastic audience.
We were allowed two minutes for
an interview ....
"You are from the campus news
paper?" Robeson asked, in a low and
hardly audible speaking voice; yet
one easily understood because of
perfect enunciation.
"My remembrances of college, and
my greatest rewards from collegc
grew out of the personal contacts I
made through activities. 1 spent
most of my time in football and
debating but the personal acquain
tances I formed with the professors
were invaluable.
At this point, the demanding mob

' could not be kept out any longer,
J and the door opened to let streams
; of peopleâ€”students, professors, Rut
: ger alumni, negroes into the
Ismail room.
Among the first to reach him wan
jan old white-haired colored lady
1 who put out her hand and said.
1 "I'm glad to shake yo' hand, Mr.
j Robeson, an' I hopes yo' goes to
| heav'n."
A student with a program to be
j autographed gave Robeson a chem
istry book to write on, remarking
i that it probably brought back mem
ories.
After many minutes, when the
; crowd had thinned somewhat, he
was asked if he minded the mob of
people, and he bashfully insisted
that he enjoyed them. Even inter
ruptions in the program 1o admit
late-comers were forgiven because
jhe sings for the audiences. "Sup
pose." Robeson said, "they didn't
I like it, and went home!"
