# SYMPHONY TO HOLD REHEARSAL TONIGHT FOR NEXT CONCERT
## 
### 
Final rehearsals for the concert to
be given by the Stanford Symphony
orchestra at Burlingame High School
March 12, will begin tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Roble Gymnasium.
A performance was given in Bur
lingame by the campus musicians
last year and aroused so great an
interest in the work done that an
invitation has again been extended
this year.
Beethoven's First Symphony, the
number that was so well received
on the campus last quarter, will be
featured in the concert. As guests
of the San Francisco Symphony,
members of the orchesrta heard
Dobrowen's interpretation of (he se
lection on February 22.
The Burlingame concert is to be
an invitational one; the public at
large is not invited.
