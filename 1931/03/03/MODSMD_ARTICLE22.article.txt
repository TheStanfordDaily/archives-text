# ROBESON GIVEN GREAT OVATION
## Many Encores Demanded Of Negro Singer 
### Helen Thomas 
Wildly applauded by a huge crowd
that filled the Pavilion to the rafters
last night, Paul Robeson was forced
to sing encore after encore of the
songs so characteristic of his race.
The singer, with his modest poise
and friendly smile, completely capti
vated his audience. His huge figure
seems in keeping with his rich bari
tone voice that drops almost to a
bass in the lower register.
His tones are particularly suited to
the spirituals. They have a penetrat
ing nasal quality that changes to
perfectly rounded notes in the soft
er cadences of his selections.
His rendition of "Water Boy" and
"Weepin' Mary" was the crooning,
childlike negro at his best, while
the stirring "Didn't My Lord De
liver Daniel" and "I Got a Home
in-a dat Rock," with their marked
rhythm and hurried syncopation
were reminiscent of Mississppi
wharves and cotton fields.
As a classical artist Robeson's
talent is less outstanding. His voice
is not particularly suited to this
type of song, but his perfect diction
and genuine feeling made "Oisis
and Olsiris" a thing of beauty.

Lawrence Brown, associated with
Robeson since 1925, sang several
numbers, notably "Li'l David," with
the baritone. His voice is a pleasing
tenor, and his piano accompani
ments show a carefully cultivated
musical talent.
Robeson closed the program with
the number that was the high-light
of the evening, "01' Man River." It
was the soul of his own race that,
interpreted by the singer in the
throbbing measures, moved . the
audience most profoundly.
