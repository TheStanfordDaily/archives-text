## 
### 
HANOVER, N.H., Feb. 28.—Al
though many college professors dis
like the idea of giving examinations,
Robert Frost, the poet, who is con
ducting a class in poetry at Dart
mouth college here, actually did
something about it today.
Frost didn't care to give an ex
amination, but, as he was under
orders from the administration, he
went to the blackboard and wrote,
"Do the thing that you think will
please me most."
Some students composed original
poems; others wrote critical essays;
some praised the professor. One
student, taking Frost at his word,
simply got up and walked out.
