# BURY THE DEAD
## 
### 
Last we<?k The Daily condemned the action of the
Kxecutive Committee in defeating a motion to abolish class
vice-presidencies and to consolidate the respective class
secretarial and treasury olliees.
Tonight the Committee will again have an opportunity
to pass some intelligent legislation on this subject.
Stanford class ollicers are largely dead figureheads, use
less symbols of a government that does not exist. Once
every year, each class elects four officers; before the year
is over, elections are held for the useless successors of three
of these ollicers. Class treasurers are not distracted from
their non-existent work by mid-semester polls.
Class olliees are sought not as opportunities for service
in the student interest, but simply for the honor the titles
mav convey. A single class oflicer could perform the duties
of the four present ollicers in each class, without any undue
strain. Perhaps the Quad might not seem the same, without
its groups of ollicers named and pictured; perhaps fra
ternity and sorority groups might feel the loss of "pres
tige"' without class vice-presidents and secretaries on their
rolls; but a considerable amount of inefficiency and dead
wood could be eliminated by intelligent action of the Kxecu
tive Committee.
Tonight the Kxecutive Committee will meet, with the
opportunity to take that intelligent action, to legislate these
dead figureheads out of existence. The Daily will report
tomorrow on the committee's action.
