Those who 1/old that the junior colleges are fast be
coming the backbone of our educational system might do
well to consider the recent uproar created by the students
of Snn Mateo Junior College.
The atmosphere of the peninsula school has always been
something resembling a cross between Hollywood High
School and a movie director's university, but the San Mateo
students have apparently .just discovered it.
That in itself is commendatory, but the students, through
the medium of their president, lay the blame to the faculty,
and threaten a walkout if restrictions on them (ire not
lightened and their demands enforced.
All of which would lead one to believe that the junior
colleges are not quite ready to become an integral part of
the educational structure.
