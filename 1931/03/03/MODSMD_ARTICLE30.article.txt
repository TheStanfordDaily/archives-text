Stanford's Pan-Hellenic council is not the only such j
group that occasionally sneaks over a fast one on the rest \
of the student body, judging from the hue and cry arising \
from the I niversity of California campus. | \
While some three-fourths of the 7."> delegates who make \
ii|) the Berkeley institution's Pan-Hellenic council were a])-! \
parentis- looking out the window, the remainder passed, \
without debate, a ruling that prevents sororities on the I I
campus holding open house entertainments after \
o'clock in the evening. ' |
Alleged misconduct at a sorority open house early this \
semester brought about the passage of the ruling, after a {
committee of three appointed by the president of the I
Women's Executive Committee had investigated the goings- \
on. i }
To give I lie affair an even more ludicrous aspect, it now ■ \
develops that the appointment of the investigating commit- \
tee was outside the president's province, and therefore nil- *
constitutional, which might and might not invalidate the I
subsequent ruling. | I
With the justice of the ruling itself, the Daii.y cannot \
undertake to quarrel, not being in possession of all the facts \
leading up to it. But the method of its passage is a sad, sad *
commentary on student government as it exists in our uni- s
versities todav. i \

l ite faculty at the I niversity of Rochester recently dc-| J
cided to do away with all K o'clock classes, feeling that I s
students might as well sleep in their own rooms as in class- j
looms. i

There will be a meeting of the editorial staff in Thc M
