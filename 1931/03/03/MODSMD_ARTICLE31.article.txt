SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA — At the Curran
Theatre, Sail Francisco.
j The program last Sunday was one
| of the regular series of popular pro
j grams, but its contents were rather j
[ an innovation for u popular pro
gram. It opened with one of the
J most carefree of all of Haydn's gay
Symphonies. Needless to say, Con- [
! ductor Dobrowen was in his ele
j meat. Then the program took a J
! more serious turn with the Concerto
Gregoriano for the violin of the
i modern Italian composer, Respighi. f
This composition is based on the .
j music of the medieval church. The
I solo part was well played by Jascha i
I Veissi. Two numbers from Mous- J
} sorgsky's opera, "Khowantchina," j
! were heard next, and the program j
was closed in the approved style j
, with the Second Hungarian Rhap
| sody.
i Next Friday and Sunday Jose ]
! Iturbi will be guest artist. He will 1
play piano concertos of Mozart and ;
Liszt with the orchestra, and the i
ojchestra will offer Brahms' Third !
i Symphony. —N. B.

FESTlVAL—Struthers Burt. Scrib-

ners, N.Y. 1931.
The hero of "Festival," Dorn
Griffiths, retired from business to
find ever-longed-l'or reality. Since
Struthers Burt is writing a moral
tale, the result is that Americans, at
least, exemplified by Griffiths, need
work to take them out of their
moods.
"Festival" is about fifty years too
late. It is a romantic novel with

, hints of modernism which thfe
I writer lacks the courage to explain,
i As a sub-plot, Dorn's daughter mar
ries an Italian prince, and we learn
! that international love affairs en
j tertain little possibility oi' ending in
I happiness.
The theme of a middle-aged man
1 searching for reality, introduced by
( an interesting sketch of an incident
i occurring in his childhood, is a good
: one, but Burt is not the author to
■ handle it. His interest lies too much
jin using lovely wftrds. Thus his
! characters are artificial and his
| novel decidedly trivial. —J. N.

THE FRENCH POWDER MYS
TERY. B.v Ellery Queen. Frederick
' Slokes. $2.00. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
These inevitable and innumerable
aftershadows of Philo Vance, how
ever ingenious, begin to bother us.
This novel has the sole advantage
of being comparatively free from
the massacre that Van Dine seems
to demand, but still remains noth
ing more than a weakly designed
and constructed successor.
The author lapses into dialogue
which, unfortunately, he cannot
write well. I append some scattered
suggestions: "Let's have a peep at
the body. Nice jagged pericardial
wound, Inspector. Look here, In
spector, this is asinine. Ellery, my
son, how about a careful look-see
at the body? Keep your shirt on,
Mr. Gray. Anti-vice work made him
daffy, perhaps?"
And if we read the whole thing
it's only because it's of the age-old
non-stop variety. —J. S. S.
