# CARDINAL FIGHTERS FINISH TRIALS FOR FRIDAY CAL BOUTS
## 
### 
Training for the bouts with the
California varsity at Berkeley Fri
day night, Coach Harry Maloney's
Indian boxers opposed each other in
a series of two-round encounters
, within the squared ring at yester
day's practice, ihe last boxing
workout they will get before the
' gong sounds Friday.
; Captain Fred Johnson, middle
weight, and Gordon Gilbert, light
heavy, tangled in the most interest
| ing match of the afternoon. Two
j furious rounds revealed the fact
I that Johnson has lost none of his
i speed and punch in his recent lay
off, necessitated by illness. Gilbert
! looked stronger against Johnson's
darting rights and lefts than at any
i other time this season.
Tom Driscoll, heavyweight, mixed
i it up for four minutes with Hugh
Keenan, Maloney's other light
heavy of varsity caliber. Driscoll
1 seems to be in good condition for
Friday's bout, but he will be handi
capped by lack of reach and height
against California's champion Milo
I Mallroy.
