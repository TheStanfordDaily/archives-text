# Bear Water Polo Team Is Strongest In Years
## INDIAN SWIMMERS TO ATTEMPT 15TH CONSECUTIVE WIN 1921 And 1928 Were Only Years California Was Favored 
### Jim McGinnis 
j Stronger than any other water j
; polo squad to represent the Uni- i
; versity' of California during the past I
j decade and a half, with but two j
1 exceptions, the Golden Bear mer- •
| men who meet Stanford's paddlers j
lin their annual "Big Game" next
I Saturday afternoon in the Encina
j pool will make the latter fight their
j hardest to keep unmarred their
I record of 14 consecutive victories,
I Coach Ernst Brandsten said yester-.
day.
Only in 1921 and in 1928 did the
Berkeley swimmers have an equal
chance of defeating Stanford in
water polo, according to the coach.
lln the former year the northern
j swimmers lost the game, but shortly
j afterward won the N.A.A.U. cham
! pionship, competing as members of
the Olympic Club team. Stanford
did not play in the championship i
I games.
1921 Squad Powerful
While hot so strong as the 1921
1 aggregation, the 1928 squad was also
very powerful, but had to bow to
I the Indian paddlers.
This year the Golden Bear has a
j star sprinter in the person of George j
Koihe, and another ace in Frank j
Pilling.
An idea of the comparative
strength of the two squads may be
[ gained from the fact that in play-
I ing the Olympic Club team Stan
ford was once tied, 3 to 3, while the
California paddlers held the Club
swimmers to a point margin of vie- ;
; tory.
Two Games
Both freshman and varsity water
polo games are scheduled to be held
Saturday afternoon, with the fresh
men beginning at 1:30 o'clock, and ;
j the varsity following.
J In the swimming meet scheduled I
j for the morning at 10:30 o'clock
' both Kothe, who probably will be i
| entered in the 220-yard free-style j
event, and Pilling, a likely 50-yard '
■ and 100-yard free-style entrant, are '
| expected to be the stellar perform
! ers for California.

I the meet has not yet been an- i
nounced, mermen who are sure to
j star for the Indians include Austin
1 Clapp, Olympic Gaines relay swim
