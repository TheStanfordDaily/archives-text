# FIRST REGISTRAR SPEAKS TONIGHT
## "Lean Years At Stanford" Is Lecture Topic 
### 
Dr. O. L. Elliott, first registrar of
Stanford, will speak tonight on "The
Lean Years at Stanford," at 7:30
o'clock in the Little Theatre.

Dr. Elliott came to Stanford from
the faculty of Cornell, before its
doors were opened. He was chosen
by Dr. Jordan as one of the best
men to help him in getting things
satrted at the new university. At
the close of the year 1924-25, he was
among the last five of the "Old
Guard" to retire from active serv
ice in the university, although he
has made his home on the campus
since and has kept himself keenly
interested in the affairs of the uni
versity.
Honored In 1925
On March 10. 1925, Dr. Elliott was
honored at a Founders' Day lunch
eon at the Palace Hotel. It was also
the occasion of his 65th birthday.
At this time he was quoted in the
Stanford Illustrated Review as hav
ing said, "It has been my 'happy lot
to be a part of the Stanford ad
ministration through all its forma
tive stages and to witness the
germination and testing of nearly
every regulation which has affected
the work and the working together
of teacher and student The
registrar happens to stand where all
roads converge."
Writing Book
At present. Dr. Elliott is engaged
in writing a book on the history of
Stanford University.
The program tonight has been
chosen as being particularly appro
priate to precede the Founders' Day
cymphony concert on March 9. It
is being presented under the aus
pices of the Committee on Public
Exercises. The public is invited to
attend.
