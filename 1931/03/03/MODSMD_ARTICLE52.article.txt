# INDIANS PRACTICE ON BASE RUNNING BALANCE OF WEEK
## Stanford To Play Practice Tilt Tomorrow With Pro All-Stars 
### Francis Lloyd 
With no league game until Satur
day, the Stanford nine will be able
to put in a much-needed week of
practice. The Indians will meet the
Gaels in the third and final game of
their series on Saturday. Tomorrow
the Cardinals will meet the Spauld
ing All-Stars in a mid-week prac
tice tilt.
Wolter intends concentrating on
base-running for the members of
the squad so that there will be no
more repetitions of the events in the
first game last Saturday against
Santa Clara. The Stanford ball team
has shown a queer -tendency to
gather about the bases in friendly
groups, and yet the rule says only
one runner shall occupy a base at
one time.
Outfielders Strong
The Fc irm has undoubtedly one of
the strongest group of outfielders in
many seasons. With Rintala taking
over his old center field position,
Hunken in left, and Campbell moved
over to right, the outfield repre
sents a powerful attack as well as
a good defensive trio.
A second team composed of Jim
Mears at first, Triplett at second,
Lee at short, and Cutshaw at third,
has been developing into quite a
smooth-working outfit. With Jack
Brown pitching, and Pihl catching,
and Bowles, Wittenau, and Stine ih
the outfield, they were able to turn
back the freshman aggregation with
little difficulty.
It won't be very long before Wol
ter selects the squad which will
journey South during the spring
vacation. By taking three of the four
tilts scheduled in Los Angeles with
Southern California and California
at Los Angeles, the Indians would
be in an excellent position to grab
the conference title.
