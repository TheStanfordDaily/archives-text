# Naval Parley Approved By French Heads
## English, French, Italians Approve Agreement To Limit Ships 
### 
PARIS, March 2. (/P) —With a tri
partite naval agreement reached
among France, Great Britain, and
Italy, and approved today by the
French cabinet, the new develop
ment tonight appeared to be that
another Five Power parley now may
be necessary.
Although it is admitted that the
modifications to existing naval trea
ties caused by yesterday Three
Power accord do not affect directly
the vital interest of the United
States and Japan—the other powers
which attended the London Naval
Conference last spring—the Asso
ciated Press was informed tonight
of the likelihood of the Five-Power
meeting.
Difficulties Foreseen
This was laid to the supposition it
may be difficult to incorporate the
modifications without a formal
meeting of all the powers which
signed the Washington Treaty ,of
1922.
Nevertheless all circles are confi
dent the United States and Japan
will accept the new accord.
Reports were denied today that
France, Great Britain, and Italy are
proposing to the United States and
Japan a reduction in tonnage of in
dividual battleships from 35,000 tons
—the maximum set by the Wash
ington Treaty—to 23,000 or 26,000.
The three European powers, it was
explained, wish to do nothing that
would radically alter existing trea
ties.
The United States is credited with
exerting a highly helpful influence
toward the new British-Franco-
Italian naval accord in a statement
today by Premier Benito Mussolini,
saying that President Hoover initi
ated the present phase of the move
ment toward peace.
