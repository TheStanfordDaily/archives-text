rpHE men who go to the univer-
JL sities of Virginia and Kentucky
know tobacco . . . they see how it
grows and what makes it good.
So when Virginia students, and
the men who stroll down old South
Limestone Street in Lexington,
pack their pipes with Edgeworth,
their choice tells volumes about the
cool, slow-burning quality of this
favorite smoking tobacco.
It's the same story everywhere—
North, South, East and West. In
42 out of 54 leading colleges and
universities, college men prefer the
smooth, fragrant burley blend of
Edgeworth. Try Edgeworth your
self. You'll find more pleasure in
a pipe than you ever knew before.
Every tobacco store has Edge
worth, the tin. Or, for generous
free sample, write to Larus & Bro.
