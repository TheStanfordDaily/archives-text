# HOCKEY TILT ENDS IN 3-3 TIE, RAGGED TEAMWORK SHOWN
## 
### 
Playing in a hard-fought but
ragged game yesterday afternoon the
senior and junior hockey teams
battled to a 3-3 tie. A previously
made ruling prevented an extra per- !
iod play-off to break the tie.
Long drives featured the game
while the only co-ordinated passing
was done by the senior forward line, i
All goals were scorcd after scrapping
inside the striking circle with very
few clean hits made.
Bess Leggett scored all three of j
the junior tallies. One was a freak j
shot made when she was flat on the j
turf. Elizabeth McCollough and i
Edith Badger playing right inside ;
and center on the senior forward
wall turned in the most consistent ;
games.
Juniors will face the sophomores
in what 'is doped to be the hardest
game of the series tomorrow after- j
noon at 4:20 o'clock. In the first !
clash in the W.A.A. series the sopho- j
mores gave a badly battered fresh
man team a 14-0 trouncing.
