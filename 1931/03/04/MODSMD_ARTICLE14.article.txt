# ONE ACT PLAYS WILL DE GIVEN
## Plays By Famous Authors To Be Featured 
### 
Student actors and directors will
give a program of three one-act
plays in the Little Theatre tonight
at 8 o'clock, according to Harold
Helvenston, director of dramatics.
Contrasted with former presenta
tions of these programs only plays
by recognized authors will be pro
duced, he declared. There has been
general faculty supervision of the
"one-acts" but all the work has been
done by members in the acting and
directing classes. Frederick Stover's
class has prepared all necessary sets.
Sir James Barrie's whimsical
comedy, "The Old Lady Shows Her
Medals," will be directed by Jack
Hinchliffe. Leading roles are to be
taken by Mina Hughes and Milton
Hand. The supporting cast includes
Zona Owen, Bess Leggett, Margaret
Friedman, and Mario Perelli-Minetti.
In the Russian comedy written by
Adam Tcheckov, Ruth Lockett, Leo
Matesky, Ralph Giberson, and Mar
ion Reich have parts. Earl Rouda
has been chosen as director for this
production.
"lie," one of Eugene O'Neil's best
known one-act plays will be given
under the direction of Marian Little
field. The scene is laid on a whal
ing ship and deals with New Eng
land characters. The title is itself
a colloquial corruption of Che word
"oil."
Charles Hoffman and Ruth Lock
ett will have the leads. Also chosen
in the cast are George Latimer, Bob
Baxter, Henry Brill, Ralph Giberson,
Hammel McKay, Howard Custer,
