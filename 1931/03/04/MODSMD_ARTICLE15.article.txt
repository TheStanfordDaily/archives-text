AAKLAND, March 3. (JP) —
California motorists were
rejoicing today at the outbreak
of another gasoline '•war" that
has already sent prices top
pling down to new low marks
of 1), 14, and 15 cents.
In Oakland where gasoline
was dispensed by independent
dealers at 11 cents, oil mag
nates were confidently predict
ing 10-cent gasoline by Thurs
day.
While across the bay at San
Francisco independent dealers
were slashing prices to 15 cents,
they denied that a further "cut"
was in prospect there.
At Los Angeles, where prices
have hitherto registered the
lowest marks of the Pacific
Coast region, dealers were able
to repulse the renewal of the
price-slashing "war," prices
still ranging from 14 to 16
cents.
