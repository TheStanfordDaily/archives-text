Downing Phi Kappa Psi, 25-19,
• El Toro's basketball team won the
i championship of League V and their
' way into the playoffs for the Uni
j versity title last night in the Encina
! gymnasium.
j Pre-game favorites because the
| Phi Psi's were to play without
Giberson and Ray, El Toro was be
i hind at the half, with but 10 min
j utes to play, and did not work out
j a decisive margin till a minute be-
I fore the final gun.
Phi Psi's Lead Early
j Showing a fine defense and a slow
break offense, effective because of
; good long shooting and pretty good
! control of the ball, the Phi Psi's
worked out an early lead. Thanks to
the remarkable shooting of Hughie
' Miller, who tanked four longs in
six shots at the bucket, they still
had this lead at the half, which
| ended 13-11.
i After Yates had put them ahead
15-11, El Toro's Fisher and Oppen
heim started finding the bucket and
put their team ahead 20-15. Their
opponents promptly pulled up to
20-19. Parrying several Phi Psi
1 thrusts, El Toro got three more
! points, their winning margin.
Winning by default from Sequoia
11, the Business School moved into
