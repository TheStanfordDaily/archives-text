trial center in the Art Gallery, the
eight Indian craftsmen brought here
by Director Lemos are happily ex
hibiting the products of their tal
ents, apparently undisturbed by the

Remarks about their work seem
to pass unheeded; however, occa
sionally their stolid expression gives
way to a knowing smile as they
catch a word or phrase that they
understand.
