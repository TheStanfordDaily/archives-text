# FROSH BALL TEAM DEFEATS SEQUOIA HIGH SCHOOL NINE
## 
### 
Coach Murray Cuddeback's Stan
ford freshmen displayed some pow
erful slugging behind the masterful
hurling of Stan Anderson to defeat
Sequoia High School yesterday af
ternoon by an 11 to 4 score.
Anderson was in peak condition,
fanning 14 of the visitors and letting
them down with but one hit. Errors
on the part of the infield accounted
for the runs collected by Sequoia.
Massey, out only since Monday,
worked behind the plate for the
yearlings and caught a good game.
The Indians' stick work was a fea
ture of the fracas, and was re
sponsible for driving the Sequoia
pitcher from the mound early in
the game.
