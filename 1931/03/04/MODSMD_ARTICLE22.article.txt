# Early Poverty Of Stanford Is Theme Of Talk
## Former Registrar Recalls Initial Troubles 
### 
, Dr. O. L. Elliott, former registrar
. at Stanford, speaking on "The Lean
Years at Stanford," last night, in the
r Little Theater, recalled the poverty |
! and difficulties which the Univer- i
; i sity .and Mrs. Stanford were called I
upon to overcome in giving the in- j
fant institution its start.
Senator Stanford's death was fol- j
lowed by technical difficulties in the j
settling of the estate and a suit j
filed against the estate by the gov- |
i ernment, agitated because of the un- j
friendly attitude of the Southern j
, Pacific Railroad Company in which i
t most of the Stanford fortune was I
invested.
During the limes of financial dif- i
ficulty which resulted from this de- \
lay in the settlement of the estate, i
it was only the courage of Mrs.
• Stanford, which allowed her to con
r tinue plans for the University con
trary to the advice of her attorneys,
j 1 and the efforts of Dr. Jordan, presi- j
dent of the institution, that pre- j
vented the project from failing ut-
J terly.
When these first lean years had
been successfully weathered and the
government suit won, the Univer
sity encountered new and unlooked
i for difficulties in the form of fin- j
, ancial depressions. The Great
r Earthquake of 1906 also threatened
| its success. Despite the inauspicious
beginning, there was the greatest
' liberty of action and fellowship 1
| among the students, and the Uni
i versity finally reached its present
I ! success.
