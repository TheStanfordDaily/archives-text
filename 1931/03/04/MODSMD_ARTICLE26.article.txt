# Democrat Leaders Split Over Liquor, Economic Problem
## Demands That Prosperity Be Dominant Issue in Next Presidential Campaign Received in Washington; Al Smith Approves Work of Body COMMITTEE WILL DISCUSS FUTURE POLICIES Senator Robinson Flays Republican Campaign to Make America Believe Nation Is Prosperous 
### 
March 3. (/P) â€”Chieftains of the Democratic party as
sembled in Washington today, but after many conferences left the
rank and file still in doubt whether the meeting to be held Thursday
would be a love-feast or a family quarrel. As demands came from the
East, West, and South that economic conditions instead of prohibition be
made the predominant issue in 1!)32, Chairman Raskob of the party's
national committee issued a statement reiterating the purpose of the com
mittee session was to discuss "future policies and finances."'
Smith Lauds Purpose

| About the same time and across
I the hall from the chairman's hotel
j suite, Alfred E. Smith, the party's
j presidential candidate in 1928, told
j newspaper men he saw no harm in
. the national committee discussing
| informally all public questions.
He insisted, however, it was not
for him to determine what the meet
ing should consider, as he was not
a member of the committee. He
added the committee could not fix
policies for adoption by the national
convention.
Demand Economic Issue
Meanwhile, old and new Senate
Democrats, including the party's
floor leader, demanded with em-
I phasis that economic rehabilitation
jbe put forward as the dominant
j issue in the next presidential race.
Senator Robinson of Arkansas,
| floor leader and vice presidential
| nominee on the Smith ticket, said
in the Senate that Republican lead
ers still were carrying on a cam
paign to make the people believe
the country is prosperous. To sup
port his argument he cited a re
cently published article by Senator
Fess, of Ohio, chairman of the Re
publican National Committee.
Walsh Gives Views
Senator Walsh of Massachusetts,
in another floor speech, said:
"This is not time to be setting
up straw men relating to the wet
and dry issue, to religious or to
> rdaical issues, when men and wo
| men are starving."
