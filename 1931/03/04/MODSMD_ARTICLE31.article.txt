# TOO MUCH HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
Despite the fact thai Dean Robert J. Hopkins of San
Mateo Junior College has branded the current student up
rising there as "a tempest in a teapot," the entire affair
offers an interesting sidelight on the etiieacy of the junior
college and the status of its graduates upon entering a four
year college.
On Sunday night Dean Hopkins' home was bombarded
with cakes of soap. A note attached to one of the cakes
threatened a wholesale strike if Fred West, student body
president 'ind leader of the uprising, was expelled by the
faculty, the note characterized Freddie as the only boy
on the campus with IT, and was signed, "Ten Coeds."
The note was characteristic of the atmosphere that per
vades the San Mateo school, which is a representative jun
ior college. Of course, the case there is an exaggerated
one. but it is fairly indicative of the spirit prevalent at a
great many of the state's two-year institutions.
Is it so very puzzling, then, when he transfers to a uni
versity of advanced standing, that the junior collegian has
a hard time "getting on the boat?" Obviously he offers a
real problem at Stanford, which is no more conservative or
hidebound than other schools of its class, but which is
certainly far removed from the rah-rah type of college as
exemplified by San Mateo.
.lust where to lay the blame, if blame there can be, is
itself a difficult problem. Atmosphere is rather an in
tangible thing, created by the students themselves. Too
much atmosphere of the moving picture and high school
variety lias made of San Mateo merely an advanced high
school. The junior college graduate, thrown among stu
dents who have had two years at a university of advanced
standing, often finds that he must make a drastic social
adjustment one that freshmen must also make, but which
they accomplish in a body, and not as isolafed individuals.
Atmosphere, once established, is difficult to destroy
without the enactment of excessive regulations. Hut to
those who hold that ttie junior college must inevitably be
come tin* keystone of our educational arch, it should he
apparent that the time has come for those junior colleges
to clean house.
