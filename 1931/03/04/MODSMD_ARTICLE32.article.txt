This week Stanford students have an exceptional oppor
tunity in the visit of eight Indians from New Mexico, who
are exhibiting various aspects of their culture in the Art

The Indians were selected from their tribal groups be
cause of their ability in their respective arts and crafts.
One member of the troupe is one of the best Indian
painters in the I niled States. His work is an outstanding
expression of the native culture of the Southwest. Another,
an aged medicine man, thrilled many yesterday bv his
sand-painting, lie works on a level Moor of neutral-tinted
sand, some twenty feel square, using colored sands to paint
symbolic figures of Indian runners and hunters. A third
Indian is an expert silversmith, who mounts turquoise
found in his native state. Included in the group are two
children, who assist in the weaving of rugs and blankets.
One of the Indians lives in Santa Fe and has assumed
quite a bit of our western American civilization. At home
he wears pajamas with livid purple stripes. On his arrival
at Stanford, he remarked, "Well, so this is college!" Those
who call themselves Stanford Indians might well get some
pointers from this chap.
