# THEY NEED SOME ALARM CLOCKS

As always, there were some three or lour hundred of
Stanford's and Palo Alto's own music lovers who drifted
into the Pavilion after the Paul Robeson concert had begun
Monday night and then insisted on crowding into the audi
torium before even the first group of numbers was com
pleted.
Robeson very graciously consented to the interruption,
and the noisy late-comers were admitted. Possibly live
minutes were required to seal these people, and during this
lime Robeson waited patiently on the stage.
The fact that the concert would begin at 8:20 o'clock
was announced frequently in The Daily beforehand. And
it did begin then, to the credii of the concert management.
lÂ»ut, of course, the persons who are always late, whether it
be to a concert, a wedding, or a funeral, arrived after 8:20
o'clock. They'll probably be late to the next campus event,
loo; they're the kind that never seems to learn.
