BONERS—Compiled by Alexander
Abingdon. Viking Press, New
York, 1931. (At the Stanford
Bookstore.)
A complete absence of a sense of
humor is the only excuse for not
reading and enjoying this collec
tion of schoolboy wisdom, or knowl
edge as it is sometimes written,
compiled from classrooms and ex
amination papers. It is illustrated
by the inimitable magazine artist,
Dr. Seuss.
We can do no better than offer a
few samples:
''Most'of Shakespeare's plays were
terrible tragedies."
"In Christianity a man can have
only one wife. This is called mono
tony."
"The Papal Bull was really a cow
that was kept at the Vatican to
supply milk for the Pope's children."
"A Protestant is a woman who
gets her living through an immoral
life."
"Revolution is a form of govern
ment abroad." —R. M.
A ROQM OF ONE'S OWN—By
Virginia Woolf. Harcourt Brace
and Company, New York, 1!)30.
$2.00. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
In "A Room of One's Own," Mrs.
Woolf discusses that rather ambigu
ous subject of women , and fiction.
The essay is based on two papers
read to the Arts Society at Newn
ham's in October 1928 —paners
which, being too long to be read in
full, were expanded into this rather
pointless discourse. To venture an
opinion, it could as well have been
left undone.
Women, Mrs. Woolf decides, hav

j ing a rather ignominious and sub
j servient past, have their creative
| lives before them—provided they
! can find the first two keys to free
dom —fixed income and rooms of
! their own. This, after some 199
| pages of wandering from one thing
j to another, is 110 startling conclu
• sion. We tell you this lest you ex
| pect to learn something from the
1 book (hat you don't already know.
I The essay is witty and fanciful in
' spots, and good reading if the fu
ture of women and fiction appears
jto you a vital question. —H. S. E.
ROADS TO GLORY—Richard Ald
ington. Doublcday Doran. 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
j "Roads to Glory" is a group of
I short stories dealing with the im-
I mediate and indirect effects of the
! war 011 individuals who were a part
of it. So apt is the author's use of
I satire, that could abject militarists
understand subtlety they might
j think of those who fight their wars
j for them.
Viewed as a whole, "Roads To
■ Glory" shows the dreadful mono
j tony qf war turning men. into ro
bots, men who realize that what
! was patriotism to them was im
: perialism in an enemy, men who
; returned to a post-war citizenry
j which hoped they appreciated the
I sacrifices made for their comfort in
| the trenches.
Aldington. lives up to all that is
expected of the writer of "Death of
j a Hero." His style is artistic, strong
i and vivid, delicate and poetic, ac
-1 cording to the demands of each
: sketch. The blending of .the two
styles is finely done in the best of
I the group, "Farewell to Memories."
