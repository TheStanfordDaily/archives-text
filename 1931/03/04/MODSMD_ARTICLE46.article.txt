Entering the annual gymnastics ;
meet with California minus the j
services of Fred Hines, captain of !
the team, who tore the ligaments ,
in his leg during a recent practice ;
session, Indian gymnasts are going j
to have a busy evening on their
hands Saturday when they mix with ;
the Berkeley squad.
Hines was the star tumbler of the j
local gymnastic artists and had been j
counted on for a first place in his 1
j favorite event.
I Several other men. however, loom !
j as possible winners in three other
: events of the meet. Mark Cox in
! the rope climb, John Pike on the
j horizontal bars, and Bob Dearborn
; with the Indian clubs, are all cap

i hobbling about on crutchcs the rest
I of the squad will have to perform
j up to their fullest capacities if the
j Bears are to be defeated.
