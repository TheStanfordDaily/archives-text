A couple of days ago we wan
dered over to the li.A.C. office
to visit the news director of this
institution for the express pur
pose of finding out just what
sort of a track team the Olympic
Clul) will bring down to the
Farm' to have it out with Dink
Templeton's athletes Saturday.
Sitting at his desk with tears in
his eyes was none other than
Don E. Liebendoi fer, with the
object of his sorrow lying be
fore him. It was a letter from
Mr. Charles Hunter, coach of
the Winged "O" cindermen.
Mow let it be understood that Mr
Liebendorfer is a lover of the track
game, and Rets no small pleasure
out of watching a meet that is any
body's till the last relay runner has
crossed the finish line. Realizing
this, we can go back to the letter tc
explain why its contents should
bring sorrow to one of the ptaunch
cst of Stanford fans. React<«. 0 this
epistle in a sympathizing mood, the
Slants writer finished the one lonely
page of dope and then sat down tc
cry beside the news director.
"Why, they haven't got any
body," wailed the news director
to the Slants writer, "and who is
this guy Grannuci? He, among
others on Hunter's list. I've
never even heard of." It was
true, the ('!ul> team looked very
slender indeed complete on only
one side of a regular X by 12
piece of letter paper, with only
one unknown dash man on their
roster, one -140 entrant, and one
half-miler.
The ever-dangerous names of
Sweet and Kaster, which appeared
on the Olympian entry list last
year, were nowhere to be found.
The dash events, the relay, the
quarter-mile, and the half seemed
Stanford's without argument. Even
conceding the Winged "O" points in
the shot and discus, which the
mighty Eric Krenz is expected to
take with ease; in the jumping
events, the hurdles, the javelin
throw, and possibly in the mile and
two-mile, there seemed little chance
for Charlie Hunter's athletes even
to threaten winning the meet.
Later in the evening, the Slants
writer talked with Mr. Leslie Hables
concerning a rumor that that gen
tleman was going to compete for
the Club. Not only did Les confirm
the story, but added that the whole
business was breaking his heart, but
that he could do nothing about it
because Mr. Robert Lyman (Dink)
Uempleton had so ruled. To the
news director, the competing ath
letes, and the rest of the sports lov
ing tuition payers of this institution,
(his was good news. It looked as
though there would be a real track
meet after all.
But alas, America's Boy Coach
changed his mind, and late yester
day afternoon anounced that Mr.
Hables will not compete for the
Winged "O." Not only was the
' Daily," which came out with the
news that Hables had confirmed,
fooled into hoping vainly for a more
closely contested meet, but also
several of the San Francisco papers.
I.cs is eligible to run for the
Clubmen, since he cannot com
pete for Stanford until next
quarter, and a special ruling al
lows him the privilege because
of the coming 19"2 Olympic
Games. But evidently Dink fig
ures that the eligibilifr angle
would be too complicated for
some of this country's rival in
stitutions to understand, so lie
is playing safe. Too had. for
what a difference it would make
Saturday if llablcs and Dyer
were wearing rival colors in
their habitual neck-and-neck
encounter! —Crawford.
