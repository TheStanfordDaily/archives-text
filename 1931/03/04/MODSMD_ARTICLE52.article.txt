# Redshirt Nine In Practice Tilt With All-Stars
## SPAULDING OUTFIT TO MEET REDSKIN TEAM HERE TODAY Eddie May Start On Mound With Mears At First; Invaders Favored 
### Francis Lloyd 
; Opposition can be expected from
the Spaulding All-Stars who will
, ! meet the Stanford nine at 3:15
J o'clock this afternoon on the local
J diamond. The Stars are a group of
; j players of the Arizona State League
, and the San Jose circuit.
Although no definite battery has
; been chosen by Wolter for the In
, dians, it is more than likely that j
jjim Eddie will be on the mound for
the Cardinals with Ike Livermore
catching. Eddie hasn't pitched since
the Kenealy Seals game when he '
1 gave a creditable performance.
Mears at First
First base may be occupied by
I Jim Mears in today's game. Mears,
who was out for basketball during
jthe early part of the season, has I
i been coming along very fast in j
j practice. There is still much to be i
. desired in the lanky first sacker's
playing about the bag, but practice
! will undoubtedly smooth out the \
rough spots.
Asserting that playing in the in
; field was decidedly a "pipe" occu
pation, Captain. Johnny Hunken >
forsook his outfield post to practice
|at shortstop. All went well until
Hunken tried to take a fast drive
I for a peg to the plate, when the
j elusive "pomme" scored a perfect j
wicket between his legs.
Misjudging a high fly, Carl Wit
l tenau got hit on the cheek bone by
j a ball. However, reports from the
hospital stated that the injury was
i only a surface cut. Lawrence, sub
! stitute catcher, got his linger nipped
by a foul tip, which injury may keep |
' him from practice for a few days. |
Heavy hitting on the part of Rin
tala and Philippi was the main lea- '
ture in yesterday's practice. These Â»
| two men should get invaluable ex- I
i perience by batting against the
| hurling offered by the j
I Spaulding All-Stars.
