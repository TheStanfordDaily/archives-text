# LES HABLES WILL NOT RUN SATURDAY; TEMPLETON SEES EASY WIN OVER CLUB
## 
### Lowell Cox 
In spite of the fact that he is
< technically eligible to compete for
the club, Les Hables will not wear
| the Winged "O" colors in the Olym
pic Club meet.
This decision was reached yester
i day by Coach Dink Templeton, after
it had been tentatively anounced
] that the flashy tprinter would com
pete against Stanford Saturday.
100 Loses Color
Since he is not eligible to run for
the Indians until next quarter,
| Hables will not appear in the meet
for either team. His absence will rob
I the dashes of much of their antici
| pated color, as his battles with Hec
1 Dyer in the century and furlong
| were expected to be the features of
I the day.
This leaves Ed Granucci to carry
i on alone for the Clubmen, and 't is
I doubtful if he will be able to garner
i more than a point in either event,
i Templeton said yesterday he ex
j pects a Redshirt cleanup on the
I track, although he looks forward 1o
Ino better than an even break in
! the field events.
Besides the sprints, both hurdle
I events, the 440, and the distance
i uns should pile up points for Stan
j ford. Bill Storie may give Eastman
a battle in the one-lap event, but
I the latter should win.

, John Young, the Oregon State
' star, has been clocked in 1:58 in the
I half-mile and may make trouble for
1 the Cardinal entries, and Brown and
j Storms may be pressed in the mile,
j Other than that, however, the
! track events, including the relay,
j should be all Stanford.
With Eric Krenz competing for
! the club, the Indian weight men
| hardly can be expected to get bet
; ter than seconds. In the javelin,
however, Ray and Zuger may do
j better. Ray tossed the spear out to
j the 187-foot mark in practice yes
! terday, with Zuger tagging close
behind at 180.
Johns Hurt
The pole vault, high jump, and
broad jump are expected to aid the
! Olympic cause.
The Club should take the vault
with little difficulty, since Ned
â€¢ Johns pulled a muscle in practice
yesterday and will be unable to re
join the squad for a week or 10
days.
Wtih the big advantage the In
dians hold on the cinder trails, how
ever, the Club is not expected to
pile up enough points in the field
to make the meet even close.
It is estimated that half the farm
, crs in America have no telephones.
