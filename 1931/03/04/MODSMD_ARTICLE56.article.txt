# INDIANS, BEARS TANGLE FRIDAY ON CARD LINKS
## Varsity Golfers Expected To Down Invaders By Healthy Margin 
### 
Journeying down to Stanford's
championship golf course on Friday
morning to match shots with the
strongest representation of golf tal
ent ever to wear the Cardinal, two
teams of California divot-diggers
will attempt to avenge last year's
defeat at the hands of the Indians.
Though Coach Garry Bennett has
not made the definite selection of
the men upon whom the task of
repulsing the Boar will rest, the
varsity team will consist of six men
picked from the following: Malcolm
MacNaughton, Harry Eichelberger,
Herman Hellman, Warner Edmonds,
Harry Goldwater, Bob Hawley, Jim
Rea, John Butts, and Don Slocum.
Start at 9
The freshman players are also yet
to be selected, though it is probable
that Lawson Little, Gerald Traut
man, Chaley Seaver, George Ed
monds, and Bob Brown will com
pete.
The singles competition, consist
ing of 18 holes of match play for
cach of the six rivals, will begin at
9 o'clock Friday morning, while the
doubles play will be settled in the
afternoon in three best ball four
scmes.
Bears Practice
Several of the Bear golfers played
over the local course yesterday, in
cluding Captain Ed Linder, the star
who sprung an upset in the recent
U.C.-Olympic Club matches by de
feating the famous Johnny McHugh
of the clubmen last week. Herb
Schultz, winner of the Northern
California championship at Castle
wood last year, also got acquainted
with Stanford's pasture.
These men are expected to fur
nish quite a lot of opposition for
Benett's stars, though the Redshirts
are favored to win the meet by even
more than last year's 16 to 11 count.
