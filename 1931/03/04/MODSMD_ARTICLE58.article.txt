## California Bouts On Friday Will Be Final Boxing Meet Of Season 
### 
Boxers who'will oppose the Cali- |
fornia Bears at Berkeley Friday
night in the last intercollegiate 1
i tournament on the Stanford sched-
J tile will be named at tomorrow's
! practice, Coach Harry Maloney an
! nounces.
j Yesterday afternoon the squad 1
took individual workouts on the
j track and shadow-boxing in the !
j ring. No more regular boxing prac- 1
! tices will be held before the Cali- j
J fornia bouts, Maloney states, as the
team is in fine shape now, and he i
i does not want his battlers to be j
' overtrained when they climb
through the plush ropes at Berke
i ley.
This afternoon Maloney and his J
assistant, Myron Schall, will give .
| individual lessons to each member
! of the squad. Fred Glover, feather;
Vance Rogers, lightweight; Dick
Miller, welter; Captain Fred John
i son, middleweight; and Tom Dris- :
coll, heavy, are almost certain to '
! wear the Cardinal in the California
! matches.
Maloney's choice for the bantam j
fight will be between Yuji Imai and i
1 Mark Kai-Kee, while either Hugh
| Keenan or Gordon Gilbert will be
' the Indian entry in the light-heavy !
! event.
