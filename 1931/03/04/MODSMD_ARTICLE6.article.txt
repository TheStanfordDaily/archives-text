## Botts Will Direct Dance Interpretations 
### 
Under the direction of Gretchen
Kroncke Botts, the dance composi
tion class is presenting the annual
Dance Drama tomorrow night in the
Assembly Hall at 8 o'clock. Tickets
are being sold at the A.S.S.U. of
fice, Sherman and Clay in Palo
Alto, Roble Hall, and on the Row
by members of the Women's Athletic
Association, according to Margaret
Abrams, ticket manager.
The first half of the program will
consist of divertissements including
highly dramatic, lyric, and comic
interpretations. Among these dances
will be a grotesque characterization
of a mosquito, the development of
several moods in Chopin, the musi
cal dramatization of A. A. Milne's
"The King's Breakfast," a "Dance
Without Music," done in the manner
of the modern German school, and
other creations by members of the
class.
The final number will unfold Ana
tole France's dramatic legend of
"The Juggler of Notre Dame," the
story of the poor juggler who dies
at the feet of a statue of the Virgin
while showing his tricks, his death
constituting the Perfect Gift in the
eyes of the Madonna who raises her
hand in a miraculous gesture of
blessing. It is done entirely in
dance and pantomime.
