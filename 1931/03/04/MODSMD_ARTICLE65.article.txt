# SCHOLARSHIPS TO BE GIVEN NEXT QUARTER
## 
### 
All University scholarships for
1931-32, except those reserved for
entering undergraduates, will be
awarded during the spring quarter.
Applications for undergraduate
scholarships should be filed by April
10th, for graduate scholarships by
April 1.
As no scholarships are automati
cally renewed, and no applications
are carried over from one year to
another, students who have applica
tions on file for the current year
should re-apply at this time. Appli
cation blanks and further informa
tion may be obtained at the office
of the Committe on Scholarship.
