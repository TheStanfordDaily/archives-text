# WOMEN SWIM BY NIGHT IN MEN'S POOL Roughs Partake of Midnight Suppers in Roble Kitchen CAMPUS HONEYCOMBED BY DARK TUNNELS
## 
### 
Midnight suppers enjoyed in 11
Roble kitchen by exploring roughs, J
sux-reptitious dips into Encina pool i ;
at 3 o'clock in the morning by '
young ladies of the "500," and other
curious happenings ai'e among the
rumors encircling the prosaic steam
pipe system of the University in a j
halo of romantic tradition.
The story of a secret underground ]
tunnel that exists connecting all the .
buildings on the campus and dis- j
appears into a mysterious black j
hole somewhere under the Quad is i
substantiated to a slight degree by j
E. H. Waterman, in charge of the I
power house.
High enough for a student to walk |
stooping through it, the tunnel, !
built at the founding of the Uni- i
versity, houses steam conduits lead- j
ing to the dormitories, Memorial j

Chapel, and other central structures.
The merit of the tunnel system,
according to Waterman, is that it
permits regular inspection of the
pipe, whereas the conventional terra
cotta conduit must be allowed to
develop trouble unannounced.
But to the adventurous collegian,
the tunnel system injects the flavor
of Philo Vance, Richard Halliburton,
and Tutankhamen into an otherwise
| mild routine.
Apparently the tunnel was not
! unknown to a previous generation
| at Stanford. In 1910, H. L. Joy, then
! foreman of the power house, in
j stalled locks on the doors of the
[tunnel in various dormitory base
ments to discourage the nocturnal
prowls of students. Since then en
j trance through the manholes has
i added zest to the subway tour.
