By Michael Crofoot
| Trailing Breakers' quintet, 26-19,
! with four minutes to play, the El
j Capitan five staged a fine rally to
I tie the score, 27-27, and then went
on to win 34-30 in an extra period
J last night in the Encina gymnasium,
| taking the title of League VII as
| well.
! Up to the moment when this op- |
portune rally started, Breakers had ■
I looked like the winner and El Capi
' tan like the better team. Inability
. to take full advantage of the many j
I sucker shots which a slipshod i
. Breakers defense allowed them had
I prevented them from matching
! Breakers offense.
Stump Starts Rally-
George Stump, sterling Capitan
' forward, provided the spark which
i touched off his team's bucket bar
i rage. Getting the tap from center
' he dribbled up the floor a few yards
| and let fly a long shot which banged
| back through the bucket.
Then he straightway duplicated
; the play, but this time the ball spun
! rourrd and then out of the hoop. .
■ Weeks, alert running mate of Stump,
was there for the follow up shot. On
j the next play Weeks drove in for
| the basket, shot and missed. Fair, j
Capitan center, took the ball off the
j backboard and tipped it in. Then
J Weeks made a foul shot good to I
! tie the score.
Breaker Threats Checked
In the extra period Fair, Weeks,
! and Stump looped in long shots,
I while the Capitan defense held in
' check Pinero, and Cook, Breakers'
' threats.
The Phi Kappa Sigma-Delta Kap-
I pa Epsilon game for the champion
| ship of League II was unable to be
i played because the Pavilion was
j decorated for the dance drama. Chi
i Psi won by default from Phi Sigma
! Kappa.
