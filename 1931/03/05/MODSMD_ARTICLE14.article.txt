"When the Constitution was first
! framed, the people of the United
States regarded laws as a necessary
evil, but now making laws has be
[ come their chief indoor sport," ac
cording to Professor Gettell, head of
the political science department at
the University of California, who
I spoke on "Tendencies in American
Government" in the Palo Alto Wo
man's Club House last night.
"At the present time there are
several important amendments
which are being considered. Chief
among these is the amendment for
the abolition of the "Lame Duck"
session of Congress. This amend
â€¢ ment, if passed, would do away with
much of the scandal and wire
pulling which results from that scs
j sion of Congress. Another import
ant proposed amendment is the es
tablishment of uniform divorce
laws throughout the United States,"
Get tell said.
"Power has tended," he continued,
"to be transferred from the local to
the national government because of
the vast flow of immigrants without
i any state tradition, the rapid ex
pansion of the country, and the
I rapidity of transportation."
