# Cuddy Says Employers Can Aid Business Boom
## 
### 
With American employers lies the
power to start the ball x-oiling to
ward recovery from the present
business depression is the belief of
J. J. Cuddy, manager of Californi
ans, Incorporated.
"If, by recognizing that the bottom
of the depression has been reached
employers over the United States
were to assure the working masses
that their jobs were not endangered
the subsequent confidence would re
sult in a return to active consump
tion of goods that would vastly aid
toward world wide recovery," Cud
dy declares. ,
Cuddy supports his statements by
the fact that savings accounts of
workmen have increased; and that
though the unemployed total 10 pel
cent of the working population, 90
per cent draw reasonable salaries
These workers remain the most po

! tent buying force in America, he
believes.
Touching upon the field of ad
vertising, in which his own interest
lies, Cuddy declares that the United
I States leads the countries of the
world in development of advertis
i ing.
"A new career for the well-bal
, aneed, adventurous student," he
says, "is that of foreign advertiser.
To extend and stimulate foreign
markets, American advertising is
I spreading its agencies to all far-
I flung countries of the world.
"Foreign work of this type calls
for advertisers of super-ability, in
volving the capacities of copy
writer, diplomat, linguist, and acute
psychologist. His job is usually to
i J direct a staff of native advertisers
,in the adaptation of American
' methods to the native interest."
