# TRADE POLICY DISCUSSED IN BANK DEBATE
## Cards Uphold Free Trade In Non-Decision Tilt In San Francisco 
### 
Contending that free trade en
courage* maximum trade, three
members of Stanford's forensic
squad debated representatives of the
American Institute of Banking last
night before a San Francisco audi
ence on the subject: "Resolved,
That the nations should adopt a
policy of free trade."
The Stanford men selected by
Coach Leland T. Chapin to make
the trip were William Kaye, Howard
Conn, and John Huneke. It was a
non-decision debate.
Stanford Takes Affirmative
Taking the affirmative, the Stan
ford speakers stated that capital and
labor will naturally flow into the
most productive channels when it is
effected by no artificial stimuli.
I'hey pointed out that the principles
of free trade arc no more harmful
when applied to international trade
than when applied to interstate
trade.
The San Francisco bankers said
that a protective tariff encourages
infant industries, and that the es
tablishment of a policy of free trade
would result in wide-spread unem
ployment and business depression.
They argued that even if free trade
is theoretically desirable, it is im
practicable, and that it would
jeopardize national security by mak
ing the nations dependent 011 one
another.
First of Three Debates
Last night's debate was the first
of a three-debate series of argu
ments with the American Institute
of Banking in San Francisco. The
second will take place in April, on
the subject, "Resolved, that the ex
pansion of the chain stores is detri
mental to the best interests of the
American people."
The third, with a subject as yet
undecided, will be held in May.
All of the debates in this series will
lake place in San Francisco.
