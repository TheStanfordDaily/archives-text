receipts from the con
cert given Monday by Paul
Robeson were $1(572, accord
ing to Carl McDowell, manager
of the A.S.S.U. Concert Series.
This figure is the largest ever
to be realized in the history of
the concert series. Gate receipts
alone amounted to $450, a sum
greater than the total receipts,
excluding season tickets, for
any single concert except those
given by Sousa and Lawrence
Tibbett.
"Up to the time of the con
cert Monday," McDowell con
tinued, "the deficit for the year
on the five concerts presented
by the series was $1250, but as
nearly as figures indicate now
the season will close with a
slight profit."
Asked about plans for next
year's engagements, McDowell
said: "I see no reason why the
series should not be continued.
However, the question will not
be decided definitely until the
meeting of the Ex Committee
on Tuesday. Managers for next
season will be appointed then,
and arrangements for artists
will be made."
