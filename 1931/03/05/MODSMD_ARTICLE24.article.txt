# OFFICIALS SIGN TREATY ENDING INDIA DISORDER
## Nationalist Civil War Will Cease; Co-operation Is Assured In Pact PRISONERS TO BE FREED Agitation May Begin Anew If Terms Not Granted 
### 
NEW DELHI, India, Mar. 4 (/!>).â€”
Mahatma Gandhi, Indian national
ist leader, and Viceroy Lord Irwin
at high noon today signed a truce
which ends the nationalist civil dis
obedience campaign and secures
nationalist cooperation in working
out a qualified dominion status for
India.
The truce culminated negotiations
of weeks which reached fulfillment
in an agreement at 1:30 a.m. Shortly
afterwards Gandhi left the Viceregal
Palace in a drenching rain to in
form the Nationalist working com
mittee at Old Delhi..
Gandh i Unconcerned
While the committee voted unani
mous approval of the terms Gandhi
curled up on a straw mat at the side
of the room and went to sleep. After
he awakened he had his head and
face shaved, donned a spotless white
homespun chaddar and loin cloth
and set out for his meeting with the
viceroy.
In return for abandonment of the
civil disobedience campaign, which
the Nationalists inaugurated a year
ago in an effort to gain independ
ence from Great Britain, Gandhi
wrested from the viceroy an amne
sty for all political prisoners held
for non-violent offenses, the right
of those residing on the seashore
to make their own salt, and adjust
ments regarding the return of prop
erty confiscated for non-payment of
taxes.
Picketing Subsides
In addition to calling off the dis
obedience campaign, the nationalists
agreed to forego their demand for
an official inquiry into police ex
cesses in quelling nationalist demon
strations. Picketing will be kept
within the normal laws of the coun
try, which allow any citizen to dis
courage by peaceful means the sale
of any commodity.

| The truce assures nationalist par
ticipation in the forthcoming second
i round table conference to be held in
j India, but Gandhi has said that if
! the nationalist demands for Indian
i autonomy in finances and military
' matters arc not granted by Britain
there his followers will begin anew
I their agitation for separation from
the British Empire.
