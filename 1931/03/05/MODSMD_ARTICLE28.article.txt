# WE ROOT FOR CALIFORNIA

### 
Clarence Merle Price lakes his I'niversitv of California
baskcteers to a Seattle court floor tomorrow night to battle
the I niversiiy of Washington, carrying with him the good
wishes of a horde of Stanford men who would like to see
the diminutive Rear mentor bring his stormy career to a
successful close by winning the conference title.
Price is through as football coach at Rerkelev and this
may be his last year as basketball chieftain there. Since
IU2O, he has been under student and alumni lire, the like
of which few coaches could have withstood. Price took it
all, most of it undeserved, and took it like a gentleman,
without complaining. And so Stanford joins with the
Berkeley Rear in wishing confusion to the Washington
quintet, if only for Price's sake. He is a gamester.
