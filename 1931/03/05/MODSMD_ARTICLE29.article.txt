# HENRY ALLEN COOPER
## 
### 
Ilenrv Allen Cooper, Wisconsin's 70-vear-old liberal
in the House of Representatives, died this week. His
death came just three days before he would have com
pleted his thirty-sixth year in Congress. He died with his
boots on.
The career of this grand old progressive was. full of
shocks and battles. The last scene he witnessed in the
House before he left il late last Saturday night was remi
niscent of his life. He watched the struggle of a minority
against a majority which had the support of the leaders;
he saw, as he had seen so many times before, the tide of
bitterness rise and fall, as ideas and ideals clashed-.
Henry Allen Cooper's whole life had been spent in the
minority, but so cleanly and fairly did he fight his battles
that his friends included members of all parties and fac
tions.
The present writer remembers Ihe scene when Henry
Allen Cooper stood up in the Republican national conven
tion in Cleveland in 11)21, to present the minority report
of Ihe committee on resolutions the LaFollette platform
supported by the delegation from Wisconsin. II was a
noble protest against the cold precision of the organized
majority. Mr. Cooper and the progressives knew they had
not the slightest chance of carrying their program into the
party platform, but they fought. And there was something
gallant and heart-quickening in Ihe sight of that old man
reading his liberal platform to the tremendous hostile ma
jor i ty.
Henry Allen Cooper's life was a long battle against
hostile majorities; it was a stirring life, and its story brings
vicarious excitement to all those who thrill at a noble figlil
against overwhelming odds.
