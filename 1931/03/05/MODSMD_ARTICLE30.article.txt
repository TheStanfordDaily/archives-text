" if Abraham Lincoln had gone lo a state university lie
would have been ruined, tie would have learned how to
gel grades by taking pipe courses, and would have learned |
dirty politics. He would have been standardized."
"This statement was made by Professor Edward Me-i
Mahon of the history department at the University of
Washington in an address commemorating Lincoln's birth-1
day. 11 is not a new thought in the field of education, but
il is strange coming from one active in a major university.
"A university education is an admirable thing in many
ways, but often ils standardizing influence is disastrous.
For the average man il undoubtedly is highly advanta-'
geous, but not for a great individualist like Lincoln. The
mass gains but the individual suffers in modern American
education.
"As was brought out by Professor McMahon, whelher
or not mass education in universities is a success is a ques-,
lion of grave doubt, lis alternative, the Oxford system,
is as uncertain. In England the mass is subordinated to
the individual.
" The best possible solution seems lo be found in a com
bination ol the two. Several eastern universities have,
made steps in this direction by standardizing the first two
\ears and leaving the individual lo his own resources in
the junior and senior years. This movement is al present ,
in an experimental stage, but the results have been highly
satisfactory.

America have been lacking in many respects, and with
