( EDITOR'S NOTE: The Hull Session, founded in / r >-Y> mid in retirement j
| since 1V29, returns to the editorial pai/c with this issue and as a re (pilar daily :
feature. It is to be a column of discussion, for iMch contributions will he j
I welcomed. 7 hey should be addressed to the Hull Session editor.)

Every so often some large cor
i poration publishes a series of charts
(filled with jagged red lines) prov
ing that college graduates earn more
than men who have not been ex
posed to university training. Judg
■ ing from contemporary experience
; and not scientific scales, charts, and
: learned papers, it would seem that
I these firms get the results they do
j not because higher education in-
I creases the earning capacity of men
! but because the average man who
j comes to college has a higher in
! nate intelligence than the one who
i does not.
i Disregarding the authenticity of
I these charts, it is common opinion
j and talk that college education
] PAYS in dollars and cents. While
not denying the spiritual benefits
! of college, it is felt that an ordinary
I (and even more so, an out of the
1 ordinary) liberal education is not a
financial asset. Of course, profes
sional schools teaching some "high
| er trade" do increase one's earning
1 power; but how French, philosophy,
: or history swell the pay check is
' not quite clear.
i On the other hand, college de
j velops certain habits which make
it positively harder to make a for
; (une or an income. A college man
(or woman) learns to enjoy cards;
his taste for tobacco and, perhaps,

j liquor, is stimulated; he learns to
| enjoy the theatre, golf, maybe con
! certs. These pursuits make it very
| difficult to accumulate the lowly
j and philosophically despised dollar
after one stops balancing monthly
] budgets by telegraphing home.
In addition to this handicap, the
: average college graduate is bur
! dened down with the notion of his
I own superiority. He often feels that
j a diploma is a commanding pistol
j at the employer's pay-roll. He feels
; superior to the man who cannot
i claim relationship to Podunk, Walla
I Walla, or some other equally worthy
! alma mammy; he places himself
I above the man who has not mas
' tered artistic pipe-smoking—racy
driving—successful bluffing — and
ether marks of the genuine grad.
Despite all this, college education
is an asset—but it is not an asset to
Ihe individual who is planning on
: turning English compositions into
stock certificates or history reports
into bank balances. College gives
one a savoir faire—a way of living
that is appealing but none the less
expensive.
In short, the undergraduate who
has dreams or hopes of mastering
| the business world by means of a
| liberal education is due for a rough
! jolt soon after graduation,
