THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU
At the Varsity Theatre.
Great snow slides and mountain ;
climbing parties are to be seen in
"The White Hell of Pitz Palu»" It .
is a foreign-made picture, filmed in ;
the Alps, and has the usual foreign !
attribute of good photography, dif
ferent settings, and effective use of :
light and dark. But along with it j
goes the foreign attribute of slow ,
and tedious action, unknown and
not-too-good actors and a general
lack of punch.
The story concerns a trio of |
climbers trapped on the north wall
of the dangerous Pitz Palu, and Ihe
raging of the elements. It has no
dialogue, and things seem to hap- i
pen pretty slowly. If you are not |
interested in its pictorial attraction, '
you will squirm in your seat.
Besides, the picture will leave you j
with the permanent chills. —J. T. 1

SIT TIGHT—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
While owning and conducting a
health farm, Winnie Lightner, as- ,
sisted by Joe E. Brown, finds that i
her business includes training
wrestlers, especially if they have 1
possibilities of becoming world- 1
famous. The fiance of a wealthy I
girl loses his job, so Winnie decides
that he is to be the champion.
The result is several wrestling
matches, which are better than the
rest of the picture put together, and
a bit longer than the glimpse of
matches usually shown in news j
reels.
Saving the two hours from com
plete ennui are two interesting fea

tures, "A Trip Through Ireland,"
and the first of a series of Burns
Detective Agency stories which is
intense, and as exciting as many a
Philo Vance opus. —J. N.

CHICAGO CIVIC OPERA COM
PANY—At the San Francisco
Auditorium.
The impressive majesty of "Die
Walkure," first of Richard Wagner's
immortal trilogy, was offered to
opera-lovers on Tuesday evening in
a presentation remarkable for its
interpretation of the epic's ponder
ous mood.
Although the production as a
whole was unusually well-balanced,
perhaps the outstanding perform
ances were given by Frieda Lieder
as Brunhilde, the Valkyrie, Maria
Olszewska as Fricka, Wotan's wife,
and Alexander Kipnis as Wotan.
Mme. Lieder imbued hei; role with
a histrionic and musical splendor
that reached a glorious climax in
the final act.
Mme. Olszewska exhibited a poise
and imperious bearing well-fitted
to the role that she sang with
beauty and eloquence, while Kipnis'
splendid voice gave to his Wotan
the dignity and godliness the part
commands.

opera-lovers on Tuesday evening in
a presentation remarkable for its
interpretation of the epic's ponder
ous mood.
Although the production as a
whole was unusually well-balanced,
perhaps the outstanding perform
ances were given by Frieda Lieder
as Brunhilde, the Valkyrie, Maria
Olszewska as Fricka, Wotan's wife,
and Alexander Kipnis as Wotan.
Mme. Lieder imbued hei; role with
a histrionic and musical splendor
that reached a glorious climax in
the final act.
Mme. Olszewska exhibited a poise
and imperious bearing well-fitted
to the role that she sang with
beauty and eloquence, while Kipnis'
splendid voice gave to his Wotan
the dignity and godliness the part
commands.
THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU
At the Varsity Theatre.
Great snow slides and mountain ;
climbing parties are to be seen in
"The White Hell of Pitz Palu»" It .
is a foreign-made picture, filmed in ;
the Alps, and has the usual foreign !
attribute of good photography, dif
ferent settings, and effective use of :
light and dark. But along with it j
goes the foreign attribute of slow ,
and tedious action, unknown and
not-too-good actors and a general
lack of punch.
The story concerns a trio of |
climbers trapped on the north wall
of the dangerous Pitz Palu, and Ihe
raging of the elements. It has no
dialogue, and things seem to hap- i
pen pretty slowly. If you are not |
interested in its pictorial attraction, '
you will squirm in your seat.
Besides, the picture will leave you j
with the permanent chills. —J. T. 1

SIT TIGHT—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
While owning and conducting a
health farm, Winnie Lightner, as- ,
sisted by Joe E. Brown, finds that i
her business includes training
wrestlers, especially if they have 1
possibilities of becoming world- 1
famous. The fiance of a wealthy I
girl loses his job, so Winnie decides
that he is to be the champion.
The result is several wrestling
matches, which are better than the
rest of the picture put together, and
a bit longer than the glimpse of
matches usually shown in news j
reels.
Saving the two hours from com
plete ennui are two interesting fea

tures, "A Trip Through Ireland,"
and the first of a series of Burns
Detective Agency stories which is
intense, and as exciting as many a
Philo Vance opus. —J. N.
