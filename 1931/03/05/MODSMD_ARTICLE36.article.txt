noisy squeak hail hail the gangs

! a glowing suggestion to give those
j palm drive gates a push in the
right direction why not hang a huge
I neon sign between the gates then

1 other places of amusement in the
vicinity.

dance drama ihree cheers and a
couple of elephants anyhow cul

sonous mosquito we have plenty
of the real things right in out

dence and we always respect trust
