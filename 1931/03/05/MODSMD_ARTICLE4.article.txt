# AL SMITH DECLARES PROHIBITION IS ISSUE
## 
### 
The National Democratic Committee will meet today in Washington. According to Al Smith, prohibi
tion must be an issue of the 1932 presidential campaign, and it is this assertion that has caused pleas for
harmony to be made by party leaders. Fear of strife between northern and southern Democrats led by
Senators Sheppard and Morrison over this issue is feared, due to the widely differing opinions on the
question. John J. Kaskob and Jouett Shouse are expected to propose several resolutions on the subject
for debate.
