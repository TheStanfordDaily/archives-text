Despite contradicting state
ments in various newspapers
hereabouts, it is definitely de
cided lhat Lcs Ha Ides will not
run in the sprints Saturday for
either tin; Olympic Club or
Stanford U. Knowing that llus
hoped-for Hables-Dyer battle is
blasted, track enthusiasts can
now turn their attention to other
events in a search for thrills.
Not that the mile is an espe
cially exciting race, but this
man Harry Carter of the Club
team is likely to be the answer
to the prayer of the fans.
The trouble is that Carter will
probably not be content with mak
ing the event close, but will stretch
his legs over the four-lap distance
to lead the Indian entrants across
the tape by several healthy yards.
Carter, a graduate of U.C., ran in
the interelass meet at Berkeley
Tuesday to beat out Iron Man Moss
man in the excellent early season
time of 4:29.3. If anyone has for
gotten, let us remind you that Mr.
Mossman is the gentleman who beat
out Templeton's milers in the Big
Meet last year, and then, after a
short rest, came back to grab an
other first place in the eight-lap
grind.
Competing with Carter should
bring out the host in Bob
It row n, who has run 4:32 for
Dink already this season. A!
Storms, who was ineligible last
year, has been right on Brown's
heels in practice, and may
spring a surprise Saturday. He
i-; capable of 4:30. At any rate,
this event should be close,
though the Winged "O" looks
to have the edge.
The water polo feud with the
Golden Bear will be re-opened in
Encina pool Saturday afternoon, and
with one of the best teams they
have had in some time, the Berkeley
mermen will be out to revenge the
long string of wins that Brandsten's
swimmers hold over them. Last year
a certain sports writer on the "Daily
Californian" felt quite hurt because
this student publication predicted
that the dear old Bear would take
another on the nose. Said scribe re
marked (very angrily) in his col
umn a couple of days before the
massacre that California would not
lose the match, and lhat he was of
fended at such glaring, out-and-out
prophesying.
This year, the Blue and Gold
scribe would almost be justified
in taking offense at such a pre
diction. However, we believe
that the Indian paddlers will
again romp off with the well
known bacon. Frank Booth.
Austin Clapp, Whitey Burns,
and I'aul de Silva, four of the
Indian water poloists, were
chosen to swim for the Winged
"O' last week-end at Los An
geles against L.A.A.C., in a meet
staged to get a line on talent
for the Olympic Games of 1932.
The southern outfit was defeat
ed in one of the two matches,
which speaks well for Brand
sten's men.
As for the swimming meet itself,
the Bears haven't a prayer. Last
year the "Daily" had the audacity
to predict that the Blue and Gold
ivould take exactly 13 unlucky
points, another statement which
oiqued the aforementioned Berkeley
scribe. Call it a coincidence, but
after it was all over there were just
exactly 13 unlucky points in the
J.C. scoring column!
We are not going to prophesy
a similar outcome for next Sat
urday. for the chances are that
the Bear will fall short of the
regulation 13. A team that could
take only 24 points from tlfe
Webfcet will find it difficult to
take half that many from the
Indians, since the local mermen
defeated the U. of (). squad by
a 54 to 30 count without the
services of their breast-stroke
star, Whitey Burns.
Followers of the divot-digging
port on this campus are looking
/ith interest upon the match slated
;ith California over Stanford's dif
cult golf course Friday. This affair
)oks like another triumph for the
ndian, with the Blue and Gold con
eded a chance in just two of the
ix singles matches. It will be in
resling to see how the Berkeley
es take to this University's cham
ionship layout. We guess that they
ill find it plenty tough, with
oach Benentt's players doubly fa
ored because of their familiarity
ith the links.. â€”Crawford.
