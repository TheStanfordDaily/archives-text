### Francis Lloyd 
After both sides had hit the ball
j freely for three innings, the Stan
ford-Spaulding Ail-Star game yes
\ terday afternoon settled down to a
1 pitching duel between Eddie and
Coulter with the Indian twirler
, coming out on top by an 11-6 mar
j gin.
After a rather shaky start, Eddie,
\ the Card pitcher, steadied down and
kept the Stars hitless and scoreless
I for the last six innings of the game.
With the aid of two errors and three
hits the Indians collected four runs
j in the eighth to remove any doubt
| as to the final outcome.
Hunken Stars
A towering fly to deep left field
: was taken in by Captain Hunken
* half way up the bank to rob Mor-
I ganstern of a hit. Straightening out
one of Coulter's deliveries, Rudy
Rintala got a pretty two-base blow
| into right to boost his total to two
J out of three for the day. Wolter's
infield connected with two fast dou
j ble plays to help out Eddie in a
couple of annoying positions.
