# LOCAL GYM SQUAD FACES BEAR TEAM SATURDAY EVENING
## 
### 
I Indian gymnasts are busy putting
| the finishing touches on their prac
tice in preparation for the meet
with Berkeley next Saturday night
j in Harmon gym on the California
I campus.
i Because Fred Hines, varsity cap
; tain, tore the ligaments in his leg
during a recent practice session, the
I locals are faced with the loss of
their star tumbler. Hines was being
counted on for a sure first place in
the tumbling events.
California this year has as strong
a team as the one that defeated the
locals last season. However, the
Stanford squad this year, under the
coaching of Professor Long of the
' School of Physical Education, is a
much-improved and strengthened
club as compared with past or
i ganizations.
