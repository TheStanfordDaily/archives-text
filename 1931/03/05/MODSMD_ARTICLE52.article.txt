# BRUIN QUARTET HERE FOR POLO CONTEST TODAY
## L.A. Visitors Meet Redshirt Team For First lime; Tilt Starts At 3 
### 
University cf California at Los
Angeles poloists invaded the cam
pus for the first time today, and
will meet the Redshirt four in the
first contest of .a two-game series
this afternoon. The bail will be
thrown in at the highway field at
3 o'clock both today and on Satur
day, when the final game will be
played.
JVith interest in polo steadily in
creasing on the coast, the sport was
recently taken up in a serious way
at the southern institution. *They
have not as yet developed a high
scoring combination, but are ex
pected to provide a busy afternoon
for the Stanford riders.
Since the games will not be played
at handicap, Cfiptain R. A. Gordan
has announced he will start the
Redshirt second quartet today.
Saturday's lineup will depend
principally on the outcome of to
day's contest, although Captain Jack
McDougal will probably be at his
accustomed No. 3 position.
While not so strong as the first
four, today's starters are capable of
good polo, and on* occasion have
given the first string a close battle
in scrimmage.
The lineups:
Stanford— Pos. U.C.L.A.—
Decker 1 McConn
Lewis 2 Levy
Clausen 3 Johnson
Boothe 4 Westhal
