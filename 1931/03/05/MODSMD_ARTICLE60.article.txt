# P. G. AND E. OFFERS BETTER GAS RATE THAN PALO ALTO
## Earl Thomas, Engineering Professor, Discloses Company Price 
### 
That the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has offered to supply gas
to the University at a cheaper rate
lhan it can be obtained wholesale
by the city of Palo Alto was the
statement of Earl Thomas, professor
of engineering, and member of the
Palo Alto city council, concerning
Ihe recent controversy over the
purchase of Stanford meters.
The company made what Thomas
terms a "hurry-up" offer to the
city council to take over the campus
gas equipment which they still own
for a round sum of $3,000 or take
the alternative of losing the equip
ment summarily for a much smaller
sum.
Thomas rates the offer as "very
unfair as the equipment is said to
worth far more than that."
The company purchased the
mains from the University about
six months ago and the University
has no further interest in the matter
apart from the fact that the city's
contract has expired.
According to Thomas the gas
company will provide gas for the
campus at a cheaper rate than it
can be sold wholesale to the city
of Palo Alto.
