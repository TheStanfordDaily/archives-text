# SUN TANNING GETTING UNDER WAY RAPIDLY Light Maroon Finds Favor Since Advent of Indians FASHION DICTATES CAFE-AU-LAIT SHADE

With these long sunny days and
equally long bright moonlight
nights, preparations for that sum
mer tan are rapidly getting under
way, according to latest reports
from Roble's sun porch, Toyon and
Branner lookouts, Row porches, and
the cactus garden.
With the advent of Indians on !he
campus, many of the extremists are
rumored to be going in for a light
maroon, while fashion dictates a
lighter shade—something akin to
cafe-au-lait.
Chocolate as well as light ochre
are definitely out this year, al
though a few Encina Gym pool en
thusiasts are going in for the for
mer shade.
Along the Row, the usual hue and
cry is being raised by residents of

1 the exalted district near the reser
; voir concerning the questionable
| lack of attire on the sun porch of a
certain house on C--ks-y L-n. It
is said that residents of this tong
I represent le dernier cri in spring
I and summer fashions.
j Many of the 500 have grabbed a
I head start on others of that school
girl complexion by putting in the
winter under Dyment's ultra-violet
lamp. Many of the fairer sex, how
ever, ai'e going in solely for a star
light tone.
But after all, why the prepara
tion—as far as campus life is con
cerned? Considering that the junior
water sports will probably be held
under Niagara or some place where
there's a chance for water to col
lect, many of these tans may blush
i unseen.
