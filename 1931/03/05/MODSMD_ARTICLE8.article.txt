# Students Praised For Distinction In One Act Dramas
## 
### 
Playing convincingly the three
most difficult roles in the repertoire
of the three one-act plays presented
last night in the Little Theatre,
Myna Hughes as the old lady who
showed her medals, Charles Hoff
man as a cruelly unwavering sea
captain, and Ruth Lockett, as his
wife who goes insane, held the in
terest of an audience that took
every opportunity to show its ap
preciation. Marion Littlefield de
serves the honors for student direc
tion for his work on "He."

Although handicapped by lack of
effective stage settings and sufficient
stage room, the casts, nevertheless,
gave fairly good presentations. "The
Old Lady Shows Her Medals" was
made acceptable only by the work
of Myna Hughes, the rest of the
play dragging quite heavily. The
whole of "lie" was effective and the
cast competent to handle it. "The
Boor" was a silly but amusing play
which the audience seemed to en
joy thox-oughly. For its success, Leo
Matesky deserves honorable men
tion along with Ruth Lockett.

Others who participated in the
productions were: Jack Hinchliffe,
director of "The Old Lady Shows
Her Medals," Mario Perelli-Minetti,
good as the soldier in the same play,
Milton Hand, Zona Owen, Margaret
Friedman, Bess Leggett, George
Latimer, Robert Baxter, Henry
Brill, Ralph Giberson, Howard Cus
ter, David Dickey, William Wright,
William French, Earl Rouda, direc
tor of "The Boor," Marion Reich,
and Vernon Cordry, stage manager.

Those in charge of settings and
properties were: Joe Peters, Rem
Thigpen, Lucille Morgan, Barbara
Collins, Melanie Campbell, and
Nonabel Metzger.
