# INDIA-BRITISH PACT BRINGS DIFFICULTIES
## Gandhi Orders Termination Of Civil Disobedience Of Nationalists 
### 
NEW DELHI, India, March 5. (/I 3 )
I â€”The terms on which John Bull
| and Mother India will resume a
speaking acquaintance were made
public today, but the way to the
altar was still fraught by by-paths
to dissension.
Mahatma Gandhi ordered the ter
mination of the civil disobedience
campaign and Lord Irwin moved to
revoke the statutes against those
who waged it, pending the next turn
of the wheel of India's fate.
Hope tor Accord
The results of tedious negotia
tions between Viceroy Irwin and
Mahatma Gandhi formed a basis on
which leaders of Britain and of India
| hope in the future to reach an ac
cord, definitely ending the restless
| ness which has surged like a scourge
through India.
The text of the agreement, pub
lished simultaneously here and in
j London, revealed an incorporation
of the give-and-take policy which
1 ruled the negotiations.
Salt Ban Lifted
Gandhi obtained Britain's prom
, ise to release nonviolent political
prisoners; to permit the manufac
ture of salt in certain restricted
j areas; to repeal statutes applied to
all who practiced civil disobedience
and permitting nonviolent picketing.
The concessions made by Gandhi
includes the lifting of the boycott
J against Britain;* the cessation of
civil disobedience and the with
drawal of demands for an investi
gation into police brutalities.
Moslem Problem
Gandhi's Nationalists form a large
part of India's 320,000,000 popula
| tion, but the Moslems also are an
| important community and the new
settlement is not satisfactory to
them. Thore is a possibility that they
may boycott the projected second
round table conference on Indian
i affairs just as Gandhi boycotted the
first conference at London.
This Moslem problem must be
settled if political and domestic
| peace are to be restored.
