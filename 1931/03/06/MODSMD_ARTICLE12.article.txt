# DANCE CLASS DRAMA GETS BIG OVATION
## "Valse Caprice" Given By Josephine Wilson Shows Polish 
### Staff Reviewer 
| Playing to a small but enthusi
i astic audience, the dance composi
| tion class last night staged its fourth
j annual Dance Drama in the Assem
; bly Hall. Of particular note in the
! varied and unique program were
! the solo numbers by Josephine Wil
| son, Peggy Converse, Annie Lou
i Carmichael, and Catherine Musante.
Miss Wilson's "Valsc Caprice"
showed polish and an excellent tech
nique; Mrs. Converse presented a
"Dance without Music" which gave
j all the impression of a group of liv
j ing woodcuts, and drew a large
| hand from the audience. The "Danse
Diable" by Miss Carmichael, and
! the "Baile de Capo" by Catherine
i Musante expressed the fierincss of
i the inferno and the liveliness of a
| Spanish cape dance, respectively,
i and were performed with great zest.
Directing Good
,i To Cretchen Kroncke Botts, who
I directed the Drama, goes the credit
j for a remarkably picturesque dance
| pantomime, "The Juggler of Notre
! Dame," by Anatole France, which
I was staged in two scenes and par-
I ticipated in by almost the entire
| class. Catherine Musante as the
juggler who gives his life to the
Madonna as the "Perfect Gift,"
; achieved some very striking effects,
' but particularly good was the pro
j cession of monks within the cathe-
I dral and their excellent pantomime
fon witnessing the miracle of the
! Virgin's blessing.
Of the several group dances, by
j far the most popular was Lack's
! "Idyllio" which portrayed a real un
j derstanding of the charming music
! to which it was interpreted. "Gallo
i pade," by Gautier, was delightfully
I rendered by a group of five who
pranced through their parts as
j ponies with great spirit.

Directing Good
,i To Cretchen Kroncke Botts, who
I directed the Drama, goes the credit
j for a remarkably picturesque dance
| pantomime, "The Juggler of Notre
! Dame," by Anatole France, which
I was staged in two scenes and par-
I ticipated in by almost the entire
| class. Catherine Musante as the
juggler who gives his life to the
Madonna as the "Perfect Gift,"
; achieved some very striking effects,
' but particularly good was the pro
j cession of monks within the cathe-
I dral and their excellent pantomime
fon witnessing the miracle of the
! Virgin's blessing.
Of the several group dances, by
j far the most popular was Lack's
! "Idyllio" which portrayed a real un
j derstanding of the charming music
! to which it was interpreted. "Gallo
i pade," by Gautier, was delightfully
I rendered by a group of five who
pranced through their parts as
j ponies with great spirit.

| Playing to a small but enthusi
i astic audience, the dance composi
| tion class last night staged its fourth
j annual Dance Drama in the Assem
; bly Hall. Of particular note in the
! varied and unique program were
! the solo numbers by Josephine Wil
| son, Peggy Converse, Annie Lou
i Carmichael, and Catherine Musante.
Miss Wilson's "Valsc Caprice"
showed polish and an excellent tech
nique; Mrs. Converse presented a
"Dance without Music" which gave
j all the impression of a group of liv
j ing woodcuts, and drew a large
| hand from the audience. The "Danse
Diable" by Miss Carmichael, and
! the "Baile de Capo" by Catherine
i Musante expressed the fierincss of
i the inferno and the liveliness of a
| Spanish cape dance, respectively,
i and were performed with great zest.
