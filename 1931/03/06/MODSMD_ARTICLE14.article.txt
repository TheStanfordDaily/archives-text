# Wrong Ideas On Tropics Common Says Dr. Herre
## 
### 
Traveling among the semi-civil
ized Moro pirates is much safer than
remaining in the large cities of the
United States, is the opinion of Dr.
1 Albert W. Herre, curator of the
Zoological Museum, who is leaving
the campus Monday for an eight
months tour of the East Indian Is
lands.
Dr. Herre says that criminals and
'traffic make life in the metropoli
tan centers of the United States a
i good deal more dangerous than in
the remote, uncivilized parts of the
earth. "The natives arc friendly,"
he said, "unless the white man flim
flams them in a business deal."
"I find that people have three
firmly-fixed misconceptions regard-
I ing the tropical regions. One is that
the tropics is full of ravenous serp
ents waiting to devour the traveler.
Another common belief is that
I strange and horrible diseases in
variably seize upon the white visi
i tor to Asiatic shores. A third mis
! conception is that the traveler's life
is in continual peril from hordes of
half-naked, knife-carrying natives."
"None of these has a real foun
dation. If we compare critically the
regions of the East Indies with the
regions we know at home, we find

| place than in the other. The most
noted hoalth resorts in California
| have a graveyard nearby."
"There are many kinds of poison
ous snakes in this region I am going
to, but very few snakes. In Cali
j fornia a collector can easily get a
dozen rattlesnakes a day, whereas
i in the East Indies three or four
snakes a day is big collecting. Of
course, the snakes there, being 25
or 28 feet long, arc much friorc im
! pressive."
Dr. Herre's extensive trip includes
' the Sulu Archipelago, British North
Borneo, and parts of the Philippine
group. His trip this year will bring
I the number of miles he had traveled
| in this part of the world to a total
i of 65,000.
The curator expects to gather
; many new fish specimens for the
I Stanford museum, add to the scien
j tific knowledge of this region, visit
parts of Mindanao and British North
! Borneo which have never been
visited by white men and which
have been explored only by natives.
The distinguished Stanford pro
! fessor will be accompanied as far
jas Manila by his wife. He says that
j in the regions where he is going, the
i people and their ways are as strange
j to Manila as they are to Palo Alto.
