Wilhelmy, who is a printer at the
University Press, lost a wallet
Wednesday night. He neyer ex
pected to see it again, but yesterday
morning he found it lying in front
of the Press Building, where he had
dropped it.
With the exception of $15. noth
ing was missing. Driver's license,
identification card, and other papers
were all intact.
After removing the bills as a re
ward, the finder had very carefully
replaced the wallet in the gutter in
front of the office, where its owner
would be most likely to find it.
"Now that," says Wilhelmy, "was
most considerate. Only now I have
n't any use for the wallet,"
