# LIQUOR POLICY DIVIDES RANKS OF DEMOCRATS
## National Committee Meets; Raskob Presents Plan Of State Control SMITH HITS ROBINSON 1928 Standard-Bearers In Opposing Arguments 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5 (A>)~
The prohibition powder keg ex
ploded today at the meeting of the
Democratic national committee. It
tore asunder the Democratic stan
dard-bearers of 1928 and left the
party workers groping for the road
of harmony to which final pleas of
the meeting beckoned.
Chairman Raskob touched off the
! spark with presentation of a plat
form for the committee's considera
tion which called for state liquor
control, among other things.
Party Unity Extolled
Senator Robinson, of Arkansas,
, the running mate of Alfred E. Smith
in 1928, took the platform to roar
his "repudation" of the Raskob
platform and his violent opposition
to "bringing to the front a contro
versy that will divide the party."
Alfred E. Smith, smiling through
1 most of the row, came to the front
in response to a plea from the floor
and took Robinson to task for
"jumping all over Raskob" because
he had presented his own viewy.
Speakers Hissed
Roars and hisses resounded as the
prohibition furor reached its height,
but the Democratic hosts left the
i meeting smiling and relieved. Pleas
for unity against the common enemy
were the keynote of the post-meet
ing discussions.
Nevertheless, Harry Flood Byrd,
of Virginia, a vice-chairman of the
committee, predicted tonight that
a majority of the committee was still
against any declaration of policy.
