# BABE TRACKSTERS MEET SACRAMENTO J.C. HERE IN TILT
## 
### 
Tomorrow will see the Stamford
yearling trackmen's second appear
ancc of the season when they meet
in a dual tilt with an invading
Sacramento Junior College squad.

Last year the Card babes had
little trouble in disposing of the
team coached by Ted Shipkcy by a
top-heavy 88 to 34 score. This sea
son the babes will be content with
a much smaller margin.

At present, the strength of the
Freshmen appears to be in the
track events. Willson, Azevedo and
Murphy have been showing up well
this week and will account for their
share of the points Saturday.
