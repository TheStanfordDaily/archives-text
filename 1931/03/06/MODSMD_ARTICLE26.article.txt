# TIME TO CALL A HALT

### 
A flagrant violation of newspaper ethics, thai saw facts
distorted virtually beyond recognition to create a sensa
tional story where none existed, yesterday placed the I'ni
versitv in an unfavorable, almost ridiculous light. Two
San Francisco papers, to whom, apparently, truth is of an
importance secondary to sensationalism, yesterday pub
lished a storv picked from the Daily, and doctored it to an
unbelievable extent.
The Daily story concerned the steam pipe system ex
tending underneath the t'niversity grounds, and men
tioned, as part of the ancient tradition surrounding it, ru
mors of moonlight swimming parlies in the men's pools by
members of the 500 in the long ago. The story was specifi
cally qualified as rumor, without any substantiation. The
stories appearing in the San Francisco papers made the
swimming parties an actual and recent occurrence, one of
them ((noting the Daily as authority for the statement, and
the other declaring the Administration was contemplating
steps to prevent any further parties of that nature. Roth
of those statements are unqualifiedly false.
This is not the first time the two papers in question have
distorted stories from this campus to suit their own ends.
A major portion of the blame may be laid at the door of

their correspondents, who do not hesitate to color informa
tion in order to make a better story, but the failure of their
rewrite desks to check the actual facts is a fault that the
papers themselves should correct.

The newspapers may reap a temporary benefit out of
such news distortion, but in the long run they are the ulti
mate losers. Those who know the truth of such stories
are hound to lose every vestige of faith in publication
which go to such ends for circulation.
