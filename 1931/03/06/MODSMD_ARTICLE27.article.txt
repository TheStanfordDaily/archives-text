# THE 						TORONTO METHOD
## 
### 
The latest report of the sinister influence upon univer
sity newspapers by outside pressure comes from Toronto,
where the university paper, the Varsity, was ordered to
suspend publication following an editorial mentioning
atheism. The editorial's theme was that modern education
tends to produce atheism by undermining the foundations
of faith.
There is a comic opera touch-about the affair, however.
The offending editorial was even discussed in the legisla
ture of the province of Ontario. The Hon. 11. (',. Nixon,
leader of the Progressive party, demanded an investigation,
the suspension of the paper, and the arrest of the editor on
blasphemy charges. Other legislators urged that the house
lake no action, and it was solemnly decided that the matter
be left in the hands of the university authorities.
So the university's board of governors stepped in, to
repudiate the charges, and to instruct the student council
to take disci ptinary measures. The student council, under
this pressure, suspended publication of the Varsity. The
council acted under the fear that the hoard of governors
would withdraw financial support from the newspaper.
For the council, concurrent with its suspensory order,
commended the editor, and ordered the paper's start* re
tained.
At Montreal, the folly of the Toronto proceedings was
realized by the McGill I'nivcrsity Daily, which.observed:
"Toronto is a sensitive, queer town, and the Varsity cer
tainly makes no effort to be tactful. . . . Hut it is a sad and
sorry fact tluit Ontario suffers to a truly remarkable extent
from religious fanaticism."
To The I).mi v, the sorrier fact is that the Varsity oper
ates under such archaic and strict control by the univer
sity administration, and that the student council is in a
position to be little more than the unwilling ratilier of the
board of governors' restriction on freedom of the campus
press.
Whether al Berkeley, or Seattle, or Toronto, the strug
gle of the student press is the same: simply to be allowed
to publish the news, all of it, and to comment on it freelv.
