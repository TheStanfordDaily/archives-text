### 
According to the manager of the I
j A.S.S.U. Concert Scries, the profit j
on the Robeson appearance was suf- j
! ficient to save this season from a
deficit. Everybody is most pleased
! that at least one agency on the cam- I
pus will not be in the red this year, i
1 There should be, however, a more
important result from Monday's i
concert. The organizers of the series J
, should once and for all realize that j
! that Stanford is not a music-lover's j
haven. The people, or at least the
> majority, who heard the great negro j
singer, came because they were in- j
terested in a personality.. Further- '
j more, they came because his ma- |
; terial was not technically complex, i
There has been general lamenting !
throughout the campus on the poor
j support given music by the students, j
The students are somewhat justi- 1
fied. The average student is not a >
musician and he cannot comprehend j
or enjoy what some like to term j
"high-brow" music. The students |
| have suppoi'ted, according to the
manager, Sousa and Lawrence Tib- \
bett. This is to be expected because
they were attracted by popular per
sonalities and at least semi-popular |
programs.
S If the organizers of this musical !
! custom wish to place on the season's i
1 program artists who lack popular
appeal and who represent music that
\ can be enjoyed only by a few, that
■ is excellent. If they desire to pre- !

sent the very finest in musical tal
ent, that is their prerogative. But
they cannot and have no right to
expect general student support for
such programs. The rough or co-ed
who leaves his books or who sacri
fices a movie in Paly, wants some
thing pleasant and light.
The Concert Scries management
can disregard this majority and ap
peal solely to the musically cultured
few, but if it does so, it should not
conduct periodic lamentations on
the lack of student support. Stu
dents have and will support popular
artists, but they will not pay one
dollar to hear a fantasy in L sharp
sung by the world's most delicate
baritone.
If the A.S.S.U. Concert Series
never wishes to be faced by the
embarrassment of a deficit, it is up
to them to present that which the
students desire. Sousa and his noisy
band is not considered genuine
music by thooe that can go into
soulful rpveries at anything that
was written several centuries ago.
Tibbett is felt to have lost true
musical standing since he conde
scended to sing music that has sold
for 25 cents at all music stores.
Negro spirituals do not rantc as the
very finest compositions. Yet it
might prove very advisable for next
year's Concert Series to feature
men who have descended or ascend
ed to popular levels. .

According to the manager of the I
j A.S.S.U. Concert Scries, the profit j
on the Robeson appearance was suf- j
! ficient to save this season from a
deficit. Everybody is most pleased
! that at least one agency on the cam- I
pus will not be in the red this year, i
1 There should be, however, a more
important result from Monday's i
concert. The organizers of the series J
, should once and for all realize that j
! that Stanford is not a music-lover's j
haven. The people, or at least the
> majority, who heard the great negro j
singer, came because they were in- j
terested in a personality.. Further- '
j more, they came because his ma- |
; terial was not technically complex, i
There has been general lamenting !
throughout the campus on the poor
j support given music by the students, j
The students are somewhat justi- 1
fied. The average student is not a >
musician and he cannot comprehend j
or enjoy what some like to term j
"high-brow" music. The students |
| have suppoi'ted, according to the
manager, Sousa and Lawrence Tib- \
bett. This is to be expected because
they were attracted by popular per
sonalities and at least semi-popular |
programs.
S If the organizers of this musical !
! custom wish to place on the season's i
1 program artists who lack popular
appeal and who represent music that
\ can be enjoyed only by a few, that
■ is excellent. If they desire to pre- !

sent the very finest in musical tal
ent, that is their prerogative. But
they cannot and have no right to
expect general student support for
such programs. The rough or co-ed
who leaves his books or who sacri
fices a movie in Paly, wants some
thing pleasant and light.
The Concert Scries management
can disregard this majority and ap
peal solely to the musically cultured
few, but if it does so, it should not
conduct periodic lamentations on
the lack of student support. Stu
dents have and will support popular
artists, but they will not pay one
dollar to hear a fantasy in L sharp
sung by the world's most delicate
baritone.
