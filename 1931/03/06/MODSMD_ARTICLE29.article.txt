SALUTE TO CYRANO. By Paul
Feval; Longman's Green. $2. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Here Feval has threads from
"Cyrano de Bcrgerac," from the
"Three Musketeers," from "The Man
in the Iron Mask," from "The Sea
Hawk," from "The Count of Monte
Cristo,' from McGuffey's "History
of Mexico," and from three of Bur
ton Holmes's less inspired trave
logues. These threads have been
woven into what may be described
only as "lousy" to a superlative de
gree.
Characters are weak and false;
the plot is artificial, resembling the
weekly installments of a flicker
thriller, constantly rising to absurd
climaxes which, if I mistake not the
publisher's blurb, would read: mag
nificent, stupendous, marvelous,
colossal, magnificent, appalling in
its strength, thrilling, glorious—oh,
what the heck, give us our Dumas
to re-read, Grandma. —J. S. S.
WHISTLER. By James Laver. Cos
mopolitan Book Corporation, New
York. 19:50. $5.00. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
Besides presenting a clear picture
of Whistler's character and person
ality, Laver's study is worthy of
second commendation for his por
trayal of the artist's contemporaries,
and for his presentation of the artis
tic trends of France and England
in the second half of the 19th con
tury.

. r As a biography, the book was par
. | ticularly enjoyable since it in no
' way attempts to glorify its subject,
| as so many biographies do. Though
I his charm and wit are not over-
I Jooked, Whistler is presented as an
i egotistic, conceited, sensation-loving
i man, with strange remnants of an
' | honor code (spare us!) combined
' | wiih an overwhelming desire to
| make every incident or story fit the
■ | color of the moment (he confessed
l | to having been born in no less than
1 j three places).
■ j It is worth reading. ■ —H. S. E.

ONCE IN A LIFETIME. By Moss j
■ 1 Hart and George S. Kaulman; j
Farar and Itinehart. $2.00. (At the j
I i Palo Alto Book Shop.)
■ j Whether fact-founded or not this j
■ | comedy is uproariously funny. The j
, | play, now current on Broadway and I
i ! produced—anachronistically enough
, ! —by one Mr. Sid Grauman in Los
; I Angeles, is a wicked slap in the face
. 1 of the movie industry.
It concerns the wanderings of a
! philosophic moron from a Broadway !
' j rooming house to first directorship j
> , in Hollywood—and all for the use |
I of that which is his own—one ivory
■ j skull, unpolished.
Caricatures are many, diverse.
' The sobbie-critic, resembling a cer-
J tain widely syndicated female col
j umnist, delighted us.
The play is the most amusing j
i comedy and the most satisfying sa- i
j tire we have read in these many j
i moons. —J. S. S. |
