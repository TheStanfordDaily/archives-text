It's too had that the final Cali
fornia-Stanford boxing bouts, end
ing the season for Moloney's light
ers, could be staged in no better en
vironment than Berkeley's ancient
and crumbling at-hletie shack, Har
mon Gymnasium. In spite of the de
pressing surroundings which make
up the scene of the battles, we have
a hunch that the Indian sluggers
will be feeling far from gloomy
after it is all over. The locals tri
umphed in the last Bear encounter
down here iwo weeks ago, and their
forces have been strengthened fur
ther by the return to the squad of
Captain Fred Johnson in the middle
weight division.
Johnson's hattle with Nate
Magid should prove the feature
affair of the evening. Magid
knocked out Jim Bell in the
first encounter, and showed
himself to be worthy of con
sideration against any opponent.
Another outstanding fight should
he that between two football
players, Bull Driscoll and Milo
IVlallory in the heavyweight divi
sion. iVlallory of the Bears is
favored by reputation, since last
year he won the amateur cham
pionship of the coast.
Win or lose, Maloney and his
boys deserve a hand. At the begin
ning of the season they were faccd
by a shortage of material such as
bad never before been experienced
on the Farm. Undaunted by this
condition, these stout-hearted .lads
showed plenty of courage to go
through with a schedule which
called for four intercollegiate
matches in five weeks. They have
won three, and will be out to make
il a clean sweep tonight. Let us say
that it will be well worth the while
of any fan to make the trip to
Berkeley and watch these fighters
in their final encounter of the year.
Tomorrow afternoon will see
the arrival of that day for which
track enthusiasts have been
waiting since early last "year
when Dink Templeton's cinder
men packed away the striped
shirt and spiked shoe after the
last 15)150 meet. At that time
friends and foes alike were wail
ing about the passing of such
great stars as Eric Krenz, liar
low Kothert, John Morrison, and
Virg Dowell. Yes, all were shak
ing their heads in great sorrow,
shedding tears for poor old Rob
ert L. The strange part about
the whole business was that R.
Lyman Templeton seemed any
thing but discouraged.
In spite of the fact that these four
departing athletes had accounted for
27 1 i points in the Big Meet, 21V4
in the Trojan encounter, and 19
points in the 1.C.4-A. meet, Dink
refused to join in the mournful
chorus. And now comes the spring;
the Indian coach has maintained his
optimistic attitude, and from early
season performances of his athletes
the weeping fans have to admit that
•there are grounds for his position.
The names of Eastman, Hables,
Jones, and Gray began to appear in
the columns that had once featured
Morrison, Krenz, and Rothert.
But on the morrow comes the
initial test of this 1931 squad,
and in its showing against the
Winged "O" will rest an indica
tion of its potential strength. As
the long afternoon shadows be
gin to lengthen across the Sta
dium turf, the track-loving mul
titude will begin to realize
whether or not Dink Templeton
is justified in believing that this
year he has what may become
the greatest of all great Stanford
track teams. —Crawford.
