# A.W.S. Informal Tomorrow Wins Campus Interest
## Women To Date Favorites; Cardinals Play 
### 
The 2800 in general and a few
: Stanford men in particular are to
i be the guests at an informal bidless
dance sponsored by the A.W.S. in
the Roble Lobby tomorrow night
from 9 until 12 o'clock. Although
the affair will be open to all stu
dents, it is up to the women to in
vite dates, as was formerly planned
for the Gym dance.
April 24 has been set as the date
for the postponed Gym formal,
which will be given in the Dance
Studio of the new gymnasium, to
swell the amount in the gym-fur
nishing fund.
No programs or bids have been
issued. Joe Gordon has been placed
in charge of the decorations, which
will consist entirely of novelty
lighting effects planned especially
: for the occasion.
All of the sorority house-mothers
and Miss Doyle, social director at
Roble have been asked to serve as
i chaperones. Herbert Shapiro and
his Cardinals will furnish the music,
as planned before.
The social committee, composed of
Lucille Morgan, chairman; Made
leine Speik, Helen Ullmann, and
Nancy Jones, urges all of the
women to cooperate and attend with
; escorts, as all similar events in the
future depend upon the success of
tomorrow night's informal.
