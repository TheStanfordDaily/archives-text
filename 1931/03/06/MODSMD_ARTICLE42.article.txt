# EIGHT TEAMS REMAIN IN INTRAMURAL 1931 BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES
## 
### Michael Crofoot 
Left in the race, for the 1931 in
tramural basketball championship
: ace eight teams, six of them league
titlehoiders.
Sigma Chi of League I, Sigma Nu
, of 111, Sequoia I of IV, El Toro of V,
the Business School of VI, and El
Capitan of VII are the six division
titlehoiders.
Phi Kappa Sigma and Delta Kappa
Epsilon, still tied for the leadership
of League II because their schod
-1 uled contest had to be postponed,
are the other two quintets left in
j the running.
Together with the winner of their
'clash the six league champions will
enter the playoffs for the school
crown, which start next week.
Sequoia I and Sigma Chi,* the

' latter the 1930 champion, are still
the favorites for -this year's title de
spite the fttct that both have been
weakened by the loss of a . star. Se
quoia I's great forward trio has lost
| much of its effectiveness because of
! the loss of Harrison, who withdi'ew
from school, while Sigma Chi has
j been playing without Joujon-Roche,
! a stellar guard and perhaps the most
| important cog in their passing at
j tack, who has an injured knee.
Of the other contenders El Capitan
appears to be the strongest quintet
land the Business School the weak
est. The former aggregation is made
up of tall, seemingly slow, players
j with good eyes. Their high, lobbing
passes have been surprisingly ef
fective. Stump nnd Weeks are their
j big shots.
