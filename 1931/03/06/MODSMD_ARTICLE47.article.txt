## 
### 
Encountering somewhat less oppo
sition than was expected, Keith
Gledhill yesterday regained first
ranking position on the tennis lad
der from Joe Coughlin after three
weeks of struggle in the lower
ranks. Gledhill was given a con
siderable edge over his opponent by
campus fans, but his straight-set
victory, G-3, 8-6, yvas not expected.
On the freshman ladder, Phil
Kneisley failed to move into eighth
position yesterday, losing to Joe
Melczer by a freak score of 9-7, 0-(>,
6-1.
