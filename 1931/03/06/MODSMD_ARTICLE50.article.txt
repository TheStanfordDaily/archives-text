Spaulding All Stars dugout during Wednesday's game were aii to the
"fleet that the Cards certainly could hit. Should this vicious habit of

'to be able to take the measure of
the Saints.
U.C. Coining Up
During the course of the past week
California raised her total to three
wins by another victory over the
i stumbling broncs by a 12-5 count.
San Francisco University finally
broke into the winning side of the
