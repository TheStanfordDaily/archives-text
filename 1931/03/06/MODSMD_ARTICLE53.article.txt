With the recent appearance of
several new books of importance,
W. H. Davis, editor of the University
Press, announces this to be the
Press' most notable year. "Although
the Press has published notable
books in the past this year will see
publication of many more than
heretofore."
Glenn Hughes, professor of Eng
lish at the University of Washing
ton, has written "Imagism and the
linagists," a history and criticism
of the modern poetry movement.
The book is the only recent work to
treat solely of so distinct a single
school of poetic thought and method.
Translating an obscure, early work
of Robert Burton, Paul Jordan
Smith has edited the University
Press' edition of "Philosophaster."
This play, satirizing seventeenth
century academic abuses, has been
published but once before. The
Roxburgh Club, London, printed a
limited edition in 1862, but here it is
made popularly available for the
first time. The edition is in Latin
and English.
Contributing toward international
understanding are the "Stanford
Books in World Politics" the latest
addition to which is Professor G. H.
Stuart's "The International City of
Tangier," one of the new books
from the Press.
"Familiar Birds of the Stanford
Campus" is the title of a small
handbook by John B. Price, instruc
tor in biology here. The book is
a popular, non-technical identifica
tion of birds found most commonly
about the campus.
