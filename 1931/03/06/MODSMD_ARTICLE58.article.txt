# Check Reveals Conduit To Pool Not Navigable
## 
### 
A careful check yesterday re
vealed that the women's swimming
parties in Encina pool, reported in
the Daily as rumored happenings
of bygone days, could never have
occurred. The tradition on which
the Daily story was based alleged
that entrance to the Encina pool
was made by means of the campus
underground heating system, some
thing which was and is impos
| sible.
I Scrutiny of the blueprints of the
campus heating system showed that
tunnels' exist solely from Encina
Hall to Sequoia Hall, with a loop
around the Quad and a short ex
tension from the Memorial Church
to the clock tower, and thence as
i far as the Electrical Building to the
' east and the Mining Building to
the west.
No tunnel reaches any closer to
Roble Hall than the one ending in a
blank under the Mining Building,

while the conduit to Roble is 14
inches in diameter and contains a
5 inch steam main, a 3 inch return,
and a 4 inch tile overdrain. The
temperature in this 14 inch conduit
containing the three smaller pipes
is close to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

Likewise there is no available
tunnel from the Quad to the power
house or from the plant to Encina
pool. A 20-inch conduit extends
from the heating system under the
Quad to the Power House, which
conduit contains a 10-inch steam
main, a 4-inch return, and a 2-inch
pressure steam pipe.
