# RICKETTS DESCRIBES PH.D. AS SORT OF SUPER – DETECTIVE
## 
### 
The modern Ph.D. is only a sort
of super-detective, was the opinion
expressed by Victor Ricketts in a
talk given before the English Club
on "Humanism" Wednesday night
in the Women's Clubhouse.
Ricketts said that there is not
much real meaning to the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy when the work
to get it consists entirely of highly
specialized research work. One of
the criticisms Humanism makes of
American education, he said, is that
in America there is a tendency to
separate learning from life, and that
there is too much specialization in
the schools and colleges here.
The speaker made clear the 1 fact
that the philosophy of the Human
ists is Dualism rather than Idealism
or Naturalism, and that this philo
sophy entails an opposition to all
the Romanticism subsequent to
Rousseau.
