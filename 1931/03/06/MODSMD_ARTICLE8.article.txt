# Indian Ovalmen Slated To Crush Winged 'O' Team
## Superior Condition of Redshirts May Cause Defeat Of Of Olympic Athletes; Visitors Are Favored Over Indians in Field Events 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
PAVORED to win by more than 40 points, Dink Templeton's track team
of l!).'ll will test its strength for the first time this season when the
Indians clash with the invading Olympic Club squad in the Stadium at
2:150 o'clock tomorrow. Though the Club roster contains the names of
several stars well-known in the track and lield world for their excellent
past performances, the superior condition of the Redshirts is expected to
play a large part in the downfall of the Winged "O"' athletes.

® Edge in Field Events
The visitors are conceded a de
cided edge in the field events, but
their point advantage in this de
j partment will fall far short of the
; total that Templcton's men pile up
| on the cinder path.
In the dashes the Olympians have
j no outstanding runners, and it is
! doubtful that they will place in
| either the century or the 220. Dyer
I should win both firsts, while Lom-
I bardi and Howell take care of the
| remaining points. The quarter-mile
should find Bill Storie, former
| Stanford star, finishing third behind
i Ben Eastman and Ike Hables of the
| Redskins.
Young Good in 880
; John Young, ex-Oregon State run
i ner, will probably take the 880 in a
I shade under two minutes, though
Dick Wright and Frank Fullenwider
; will be right on his heels. These
two Indian half-milers are both
capable of two minutes fiat, and if
Young stops to tie a shoelace he
might find himself suddenly far in
i the rear.
The mile and two-mile present
the greatest opportunity in the track
events for Charlie Hunter's men.
Harry Carter ran the four-lap dis
tance in 4:29.8 at Berkeley last
! Tuesday, and that is about three
| seconds too fast for Bob Brown of
! the Cardinals. A1 Storms should
finish right behind these two, though
j it is possible that he might spring a
j surprise to grab a second or even a
I fh-st place.
Aebcrsold Favored
Paul Aebersold is capable of shad-
I ing even time in the eight-lap grind,
j and by doing so he would be a cinch
|to beat out Carl Gereicke of the
I Club. Carter is listed to enter this
j event also, but it is doubtful that
i he can threaten the leaders.
The hurdles loom as the feature
I of the meet provided Charley Kaster
j of the Olympians is in shape. He has
j beaten 15 flat in the highs, the time
I which Podge Smith recorded at the
| peak of form last year and dupli
| cated in Tuesday's practice. How-
I ever, Smith took Kaster last year
! in both barrier events, and would
j not surprise by repeating tomorrow.
Good in Broad Jump
The broad jump looks like a
| clean sweep for the Clubmen, with
i Kim Dyer, Virg Dowell, and George
I Martin competing for the Winged
J "O." Wally Butler is the only hope
for the Cardinals to break into the
: scoring with a second place at best.
| Martin is one of these athletes who
| can go out and jump 24 ft. 5 in. most
I any day in the week, and is therc
| fore conceded a first.
Coggeshall, Marty, and Fillmer
: for the Club are all capable of six
feet or better in the high jump, and
tinless Don Blackman can beat his
: best of the season so far, they will
I probably clean up this event by
: finishing in the order named. The
pole vault looks like it is Walt
| Hulsman's for the taking, since
Dink's best vaulter, Ned Johns, is
out with a strained muscle.
Hulsman, a former Stanford ath
lete, is capable of a consistent 12 ft.
! 6 in. Barney Deacon should take
second for the Cardinals.
Krenz to Compete
The mighty Eric Krenz, competing
| for the Olympians in the weight
events, is favored by reputation to
lead in both the shot and discus.
If he is not in condition, however,
Bob Jones will make him sweat to
get the platter out past the 154 ft.
mark. Still Krenz is capable of 10
feet better than that.
Nellie Gray should take second in
the shot, while Fred Zugcr of the
■ Rcdshirts is expected to win ihe
I javelin with a throw of close to
' 190 feet.
