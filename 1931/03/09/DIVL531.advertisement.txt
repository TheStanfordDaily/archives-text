"Burning Air"
When a public display of gas lighting
was given in London in 1802 to celebrate
the Peace of Amiens, people talked ex
citedly of burning air. Napoleon called it
a grand folly, and Sir Walter Scott wrote
that the world was going mad.
Thus was ushered in the era of gas illu
mination. It lasted for 75 years. Then
electricity stole the field and the gas giant
dozed through a quarter century, used
chiefly for kitchen cookery.
Now it reawakens in a changed world, to
new possibilities, greater opportunities.
Eighty thousand miles of pipe lines al
ready laid, extensively equipped \uth
Crane valves and fittings, prove that the
old problem of transportation is solved.
Pipe lines crisscrossing the country as
numerously as electric power ones are
freely predicted.
What has brought this second greater
gas era? The answer is: piping materials.
Thanks to these, gas men can s:iy for the
first time that they are able to pipe gas in
enormous quantities from Amarillo gas
fields to Chicago, from isolated natural
gas fields to users everywhere.
No matter what field of engineering you
take up on graduation, you will find its
future and its growth interwoven with the
development of piping materials. And,
as in the past this development has, time
after time, been first reflected in the com
plete Crane line, it will pay you to keep
in touch with Crane research and Crane
materials.
