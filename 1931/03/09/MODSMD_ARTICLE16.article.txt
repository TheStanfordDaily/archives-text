# Founders’ Day History Holds Many Sidelights
## 
### 
A brief survey of observances of j
Founders' Day since the year the j
University first decided to set aside
a day to commemorate the Stanford j
family brings out many interesting j
sidelights concerning the early days, !
as well as picturing the develop- ,
ment of Stanford from 1891 up to
the present day.
In his reminiscences two years ]
ago upon bygone Founders' Days, ;
Dr. David Starr Jordan told of the
first observance of the day in 1891.
Monterey Picnic
"We all went down to Monterey :
for a picnic, faculty and students. |
This was May 14, Leland Stanford
Junior's birthday, which was then !
Founder's Day. We didn't have au- j
tomobiles in those days, so we all
took the train. The next year we i
went to the Big Trees at Santa !
Cruz."
After the death of Senator Stan- j
ford in 1893, Founder's Day was
changed to March 9 to commemorate j
the birthday of the senator, and the i
first March 9 thus celebrated in 1891
was featured by an address by ex- [
President Benjamin Harrison.
In 1901, Founder's Day was !
changed to Founders' Day to honor I
all three founders, Senator and Mrs. j
Stanford and Leland, Junior.
The only year since 1901 that the
University has not observed the |
birth of Senator Stanford was in j

1905, when the annual Founders' j
Day was preceded by nine days by !
the death of Mrs. Stanford. Her I
death and her husband's birthday !
were brought together by two musi- !
cal services on March 9 of that [
year.
The first alumni banquet was held |
in 1911 at the Palace Hotel in San j
Francisco with nearly one hundred
alumni present.
In 1913 the first alumni banquet
on the campus was held at Encina j
Hall when 225 men and women j
gathered with Dr. Jordan as toast- j
master.
Celebration of 1917
Founders' Day in 1917 also j
marked the twenty-fifth anniver
sary of the founding of the Univer- 1
sity. Features of the celebration j
were the announcement that the j
Zoology Building was to be known
as Jordan Hall, and an "Escort of i
the Colors" in the Inner Quad.
In 1918 a sidelight of the cxer- i
cises was the presentation to the j
University of two service flags, a |
French flag given to the first Stan- |
ford ambulance corps by the city of j
Ligny, and the famous banner of
that ambulance unit.
The custom of observing Found- i
ers' Day with sacred music was
