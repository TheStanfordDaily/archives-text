# MURDERED U.C. STUDENT HINDU VICTIM, BELIEF
## Probable Victim Of Gang Identified By Means Of Fingerprints 
### 
BERKELEY, March 6 (P.1.P.).â€”
The headless man of Rio Vista was
identified yesterday as a University
of California student active in fer
reting out a ring of Hindu murder
ers believed responsible for the
deaths and disappearances of seven
of their countrymen in California in
the last five years.

Except to say that the headless
man was also a Hindu, authorities
refused to reveal his name. It was
believed that he was kidnaped from
the steps of the Capitol building in
Sacramento as he left the office of
Clarence S. Morrill, chief of the
Bureau of Criminal Identification.
The slain man is supposed to have
been held captive for two weeks and
put to the torture in an effort to
force him to divulge police secrets
before he was killed.
Marked for Death
He knew he was marked for
death, his friends asserted yester
day. He knew too of the black arts
of the murder ring, and feared they
would seek to destroy his identity.
But he planned to thwart his
slayers by having his finger prints
taken two days before he disap
peared. It was by means of those
finger prints that Morrill, working
with chemicals and powerful micro
scopes, was able to place him in the
long list of vanished persons.
Investigated Murder
He is the second man to fall prey
to the murder ring in the last month.
Ram Dhami, another Hindu inter
ested in the long list of unsolved
Hindu slayings, was shot to death
on the street in Sacramento, Febru
ary 9. His assailants have not been
apprehended.
According to friends of the slain
man, who said they will claim his
body today, he suspended his studies
at the university at the close of last
semester to devote himself to the
murder investigation.
Although it is not known, it is
believed that the man may have
been the victim of the common form
of Oriental torture in which slow
poison is injected into the veins of
the neck and head.
