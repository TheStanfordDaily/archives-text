# MEDICAL SCHOOL RECEIVES $2,500,000 CONTINGENT GIFT
## $1,250,000 Must Be Collected By Stanford In Year Anonymous Donor Promises Two-Thirds of the Money Needed to Replace Antiquated Lane Hospital if Stanford Can Raise One-Third PRESIDENT SWAIN THINKS SUM CAN BE OBTAINED New Building Would Be Built on Buchanan Street Site Between Clay and Sacramento 
### 
offer from an anonymous donor of a contingent gift of $2,500,000 for
a new Stanford Medical School building to he erected in San Francisco
was announced last night by Acting President Robert E. Swain. Coining
as the announcement does with the University preparing to celebrate its
fortieth Founders' Day, added significance is attached to the gift.
The gift is contingent upon the University's securing an additional fund
of $1,250,000 for endowment purposes within one year.
The Stanford School of Medicinc now consists, in addition to buildings
on the campus, of the Lane Medical Library Building, and the Stanford

Hospital, for private patients, and
the Lane Hospital, for clinical pa
tients.
To Replace Hospital
It is the brick Lane Hospital, for
merly the Cooper Medical College,
situated at the northeast corner of
Sacramento and Webster streets,
that will be replaced by a new
building provided the University
is able to raise the $1,250,000 to meet
the anonymous offer.
The new building would face upon
Buchanan street with a large por
tion on Sacramento street, a cite
which has been leveled off already.
The comprehensive scheme for fu
ture development of the Stanford
medical school plant originally called
for the erection of a 200-bed, private
addition to Stanford Hospital in this
area fronting on Buchanan between
Clay and Sacramento streets, but
the construction of these additional
private facilities has been aban
doned for the present consideration
of the location of the new building
on this same Buchanan street site.
Present Building Old
The Lane Hospital, with a capa
city of 180 beds, was built in ISS2
by Dr. Len Cooper Lane, the found
er of the Cooper Medical College. It
escaped serious injury in the earth
quake of 190G, but is inadequate to
meet the laboratory and classroom
requirements of the medical school.
After the erection of the new build
ing on Buchanan sti-eet, plans are
that it would be razed and the site
cleared for the erection at some
future time of a new clinical hos
pital.
When asked what the prospccts
were for raising within one year the
additional endowment of $1,250,000
required to meet this offer, Dr.
Swain stated the University authori
ties were confident there is suffi
cient interest in the further devel
opment of medical science on the
Pacific Coast to ensure the contribu
tion of the necessary additional gifts.
