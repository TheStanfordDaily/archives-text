"Entangling alliances" for years the eighteenth cen
tury picture of our foreign relations outlined by the retir
ing President Washington has been the dominant one in
the minds of many who call themselves staunch Americans.
Every birthday of Washington brings its addresses urging
American aloofness from foreign affairs, and a consider
able group of American newspapers continually thunders
at what it sees as efforts lo "entangle" the I'nitcd Stales in
European affairs.
Some see in this fear of close international relationships
the dying remnants of a former intense nationalism. Now
it is fading from Western America, after having already
passed from the East.
Eor those who most loudly oppose American participa
tion in the World Court (the present target of the cry, "en
tangling alliances!") are westerners, as Senator Borah and
Publisher 1 learst.
Hut, however much, these men protest against our par
ticipation in international justice, they never murmur
about the American dollar's participation in international
commerce. The huge loan of the Morgan interests to Italy,
German reparations bonds held in this country, factories
in Europe owned bv American interests these are the ac
tual entanglements which may some day pull us into war.
The ( ailed Slates consistently "protects" its citizens and
i!s commerce abroad, guards its corporations' penetration
into foreign fields.
And still, while American dollars roll merrily around
the world, encouraging the most intimate and entangling
international commercial alliances, still the solemn shib
boleth against the World Court: "foreign entanglements!"
