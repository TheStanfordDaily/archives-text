# WISCONSIN'S EXPERIMENTAL COLLEGE
## 
### 
With the recommendation last month by Professor
Alexander Mciklc.john that I lie present program of the I'ni
versity of Wisconsin's Experimental College be terminated
:i[ the end of marking Ihe close of the live-year period
for which il was established, came a mass of newspaper
reports that the undertaking had failed. It was charged
. . . "thai opposition to it worked its downfall, that Ihe
scheme was 100 expensive, was subversive, lh;il il bred
radicals, thai il overpaid its teachers."
Bising in defense of the experiment, the I)aili/ Cardinal
of Wisconsin advises its readers to believe none of these
reports. Quoting from the Cardinal:
"The Experimental College will ncxl year admit no
freshmen. Hut il will continue the work of its second year,
instructing the present firsl-vcar class. The 'end' is a
pause, in which members of the Letters and Science fac
ulty and advisers of the Experimental College will consider
the results of Ihe scheme to date. . . . Following the report
of thai consideration, the college may continue as before.
I lie Experimental College may begin again on an entirely
new theory. It may be modified to a greater or less
"Hut il is no! finished. Il is still a very live thing."

Professor Meiklcjohn )ms been doing an interesting
work at Wisconsin, investigating with his assistants the
relative values of scattered residence and of group living,
of classroom instruction and tutorial guidance, and of a
course of study made up from separated subjects and a
course integrated into a single subject.
Condemnation of the college and of Professor Meikle
jolui before the results of his five-year experiment have
been analyzed and reported on is unjustified. .lust what
(be Kxperinienln 1 College has accomplished has not yet
been made known, hut Meiklejohn's findings may prove to
be of real value.
