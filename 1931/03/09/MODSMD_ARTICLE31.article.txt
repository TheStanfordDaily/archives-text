We have been forced to "cut"
this morning's contribution but
it is hoped we have saved the
idea at the expense, perhaps, <>f
showing its flowing style.
Editor of the Bull Session, Sir:
The two initial articles by Mr.
Mellinkoff for the revived Bull Ses
sion involve, and are both aspects
of a basic collegiate problem. The
first article stated the very obvious
observation that college does not
prepare for tht? business of making
money. The further observation was
made, and accurately, that college
tends to spoil one for anything but
the highest standards of living. Col
lege indeed introduces one to the
aspects of refined living.
Curiously enough, the second
article in the Bull Session, concern
ing the concert series, is entirely in
consistent with the point of view of
Ihe first. It is now announced that
(he "high-falutin'" artists on the
series should be discontinued, and
ones engaged who will cater to the
"popular" tastes. Such an attitude is
conceivable in a small, isolated com
munity with no cultural advantages,
but is • entirely incompatible with
the proper spirit of a university
group, which, as stated above, is
interested in learning the precepts
of, and engaging in the practice of
fine living.
Ordinary popular music is divert
ing and entertaining. (I say this in
?-pite of the fact that Sousa's band
men often forget they are supposed
to be musicians, and in "character
istic" number drop their instruments
and fire into the air with pistols.)
Jazz is good fun and definitely has
its place, but, whert- he had been
introduced to Beethoven, who could
endure forever the strains of Irving
Berlin? The fact is that fox-trots
and 25-cent ballads finally become
wormwood and fall in a leisure time
completely filled with them. To a
man introduced to the beatitudes
of fine living, jazz cannot but be
unsatisfying as a basis for happy
leisure.
College can and does give us les
sons in the right use of our leisure
which will ensure us a fine life if

! followed up. Do we then desire to
j spurn the opportunities for sucli
! lessons and revert to popular stand-
I ards which are obviously weak and
ineffectual in assuring happiness to
men and women made acquainted
with the bases of sound culture? Is
it true that we "cannot comprehend
' or enjoy what some like to term
; 'high-brow' music," art, literature,
or morality? If so, the colleges had
better close their doors. They have
failed miserably in their true and
j only purpose—stimulation toward
I the creation and Jiving of the fine
| life. —Sturgis Riddle.
And now for a word in self
defense—lf ever the impression
were given in this column that
the Concert Series should fea
ture jazz, we scramble to the
altar of fine music and beg for
giveness. If ever it was claimed
that popular music is more de
sirable and uplifting than the
classical, we humbly retract.
What was suggested was that
general student support of the
Series demanded popular artists
and popular programs. To in
dulge in the poor taste of quot
' ing ourselves from Friday's
paper: "If they (managers of the
Series) wish to present the very
finest in musical talent, that is
their prerogative. But they can
not and have no right to expect
general student support for such
programs."
The concerts are optional, are
supposed to he a diversion to
the students. The Series needs
student dollars. If they wish to
be a diversion for the majority
—if they wish to prevent a defi
cit, they MUST (regardless of
theoretical aims of college) ap
peal with popular music (which
does not mean jazz).
Very few would attend dry
classes if it were not necessary
for graduation. The Concerts are
considered "dry" by some; the
Concerts are not necessary for
graduation. The obvious con
clusion is that the students will
not attend any but popular con
certs. —Abe Mellinkoff.

Editor of the Bull Session, Sir:
The two initial articles by Mr.
Mellinkoff for the revived Bull Ses
sion involve, and are both aspects
of a basic collegiate problem. The
first article stated the very obvious
observation that college does not
prepare for tht? business of making
money. The further observation was
made, and accurately, that college
tends to spoil one for anything but
the highest standards of living. Col
lege indeed introduces one to the
aspects of refined living.
Curiously enough, the second
article in the Bull Session, concern
ing the concert series, is entirely in
consistent with the point of view of
Ihe first. It is now announced that
(he "high-falutin'" artists on the
series should be discontinued, and
ones engaged who will cater to the
"popular" tastes. Such an attitude is
conceivable in a small, isolated com
munity with no cultural advantages,
but is • entirely incompatible with
the proper spirit of a university
group, which, as stated above, is
interested in learning the precepts
of, and engaging in the practice of
fine living.
Ordinary popular music is divert
ing and entertaining. (I say this in
?-pite of the fact that Sousa's band
men often forget they are supposed
to be musicians, and in "character
istic" number drop their instruments
and fire into the air with pistols.)
Jazz is good fun and definitely has
its place, but, whert- he had been
introduced to Beethoven, who could
endure forever the strains of Irving
Berlin? The fact is that fox-trots
and 25-cent ballads finally become
wormwood and fall in a leisure time
completely filled with them. To a
man introduced to the beatitudes
of fine living, jazz cannot but be
unsatisfying as a basis for happy
leisure.
College can and does give us les
sons in the right use of our leisure
which will ensure us a fine life if

! followed up. Do we then desire to
j spurn the opportunities for sucli
! lessons and revert to popular stand-
I ards which are obviously weak and
ineffectual in assuring happiness to
men and women made acquainted
with the bases of sound culture? Is
it true that we "cannot comprehend
' or enjoy what some like to term
; 'high-brow' music," art, literature,
or morality? If so, the colleges had
better close their doors. They have
failed miserably in their true and
j only purpose—stimulation toward
I the creation and Jiving of the fine
| life. —Sturgis Riddle.
And now for a word in self
defense—lf ever the impression
were given in this column that
the Concert Series should fea
ture jazz, we scramble to the
altar of fine music and beg for
giveness. If ever it was claimed
that popular music is more de
sirable and uplifting than the
classical, we humbly retract.
What was suggested was that
general student support of the
Series demanded popular artists
and popular programs. To in
dulge in the poor taste of quot
' ing ourselves from Friday's
paper: "If they (managers of the
Series) wish to present the very
finest in musical talent, that is
their prerogative. But they can
not and have no right to expect
general student support for such
programs."
The concerts are optional, are
supposed to he a diversion to
the students. The Series needs
student dollars. If they wish to
be a diversion for the majority
—if they wish to prevent a defi
cit, they MUST (regardless of
theoretical aims of college) ap
peal with popular music (which
does not mean jazz).
