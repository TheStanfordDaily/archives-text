## FROM A JUNIOR COLLEGIAN 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
The Daily, supposedly conserva
tive, seems to have joined the ranks
of sensationalism.
In two recent editorials regarding
j"the recent uproar created by the
| students of San Mateo Junior Col
; lege," The Daily makes lengthy
' statements about the peninsula
! school that are pure fiction—state-
I ments that canont be proved. Evi
! dently an over-enthusiastic editorial
writer accepted as gospel truth what
:he read in certain San Francisco
newspapers.
Then, fortified with these "facts,"
I The Daily proceeds to condemn in
no uncertain language all junior
! colleges in general and San Mateo

.Junior College in particular.
; Not so long ago The Daily edi
torially took to task certain San
! Francisco newspapers for misrepre
j senting Stanford. Is it possible that
i because Stanford is misrepresented,
we are to assume that all other
! schools are shown in their true
j light? Rather queer logic, what?
I Far be it from anyone to criticize
The Daily's editorial dislike of jun
-1 ior colleges. But must it build its
j case against these institutions on the
i shaky basis of the gossip of San
I Francisco newspapers—the same
! newspapers which The Daily has
j criticized for misrepresenting Stan
! ford?
