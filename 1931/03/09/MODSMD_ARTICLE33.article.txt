# REVIEWER DIMINISHES HIS PLEASURE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
During three and a half years at
! this University, I have frequently
: read poor reviews of current movies;
j reviews which often took the edge
l off the pleasure I had derived from
j a show. By far the most inadequate 1
1 of them all was that of "The V/hite
Hell of Pitz Palu." I feel that some- '
one could be found on the campus
j who could pay a little more justice
to one of the most unique and great
est pictures that has hit Palo Alto.
I In Thursday's Daily, this pictui'e
1 was described as of "slow and tedi-
I'ous action, unknown and not-too
j good actors and a general lack of
i punch." The reviewer was entirely
j oblivious of the fact, that being a
silent picture, much facial expres
sion and pantomime had to be used
j to express the emotions that would
have been expressed in one spoken
line of a talkie. This perhaps made j
I the picture seem slower to us; but
at least, the cause should be noted
i before condemning the thing.
Of course, the actors were un
known; I doubt if very many Amer
ican people know all the actors in

' Europe; but as for their being "not
too-good," I cannot agree. The por
trayal of Dr. Krafft is one of the
most perfect pieces of acting I have
ever seen.
Alluded to as "pictorial attraction,"
, the setting of the picture is highly
unique, and truly beautiful. Prob
ably no such wonderful pictures of
the Alps and precarious climbing
have ever been filmed, and they are
at least worth mentioning. Then,
too, the reviewer may have many
times explored the bottom of ice
crevasses, and was bored to death
thereby, but to me the scenes taken
down in those places were very
thrilling and also worth mentioning.
Several other fine things made no
impression on our reviewer, and the
report was rather poor, and quite
■ inadequate. I am aware of the say
ing, "e gustibus non est disputan
dum," and I resoect it, but in a
, public review like this, even if a
show be personally distasteful, a re
viewer might well give it the credit
due it. and mention some of its good
points and account for the faults it
possesses in his eyes.

The Editor, Sir:
During three and a half years at
! this University, I have frequently
: read poor reviews of current movies;
j reviews which often took the edge
l off the pleasure I had derived from
j a show. By far the most inadequate 1
1 of them all was that of "The V/hite
Hell of Pitz Palu." I feel that some- '
one could be found on the campus
j who could pay a little more justice
to one of the most unique and great
est pictures that has hit Palo Alto.
I In Thursday's Daily, this pictui'e
1 was described as of "slow and tedi-
I'ous action, unknown and not-too
j good actors and a general lack of
i punch." The reviewer was entirely
j oblivious of the fact, that being a
silent picture, much facial expres
sion and pantomime had to be used
j to express the emotions that would
have been expressed in one spoken
line of a talkie. This perhaps made j
I the picture seem slower to us; but
at least, the cause should be noted
i before condemning the thing.
Of course, the actors were un
known; I doubt if very many Amer
ican people know all the actors in

' Europe; but as for their being "not
too-good," I cannot agree. The por
trayal of Dr. Krafft is one of the
