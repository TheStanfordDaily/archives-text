## DON'T BET ON WOMEN—At the New Stanford Theatre. 
### 
i Comedy of the better class. This
1 means smart lines, and many of
them, clever characterization, and a
light, deft plot. There isn't a drag
or a flat scene from the moment
that thp very charming man about
I town says "All women are bad" to
| the surprising last scene.
The lawver who trusts his beauti
ful wife, absolutely, does superla
tive bits of acting, and takes the
laugh-getting honors, although the
priceless child from the Kentucky
finishing school is a close rival. The
| wife, by the way, is a difficult part,
since one of her kisses is valued at
$10,000. Jeannette McDonald makes

jit quite convincing at times. The
. little risque Hashes, and the con
! tinuous sparkle of the lines, is the
I show's best point. —M. L. R.
