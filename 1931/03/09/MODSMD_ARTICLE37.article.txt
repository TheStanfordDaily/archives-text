The exercising week-end just past
sounds like a glowing account of
the Great Mogul Diamond (pun: we
do play baseball) in approved l'unny
paper style. Spectators of all the
various and sundry events were by
far the hardest put to it for
ing places. You're supposed to have
three animate souls besides your
own, to appreciate all that's hap
pening at one time.
The aforesaid baseball is develop
ing into a genuine sport for game
sters. Of course, a trip to Japan or
the Islands should provide enough
burning purpose for a lot of ener
getic youths. At any rate, we thank
them for victories.
And swimming—was that an
exhibition meet or representa
tive Berkeley competition?
Three big ones for the Stanford
sailors! And as for a couple of
blond under-sized record-break
ing water polo players, what's a
pool and an opponent if not for
ducking and being ducked in?
Approaching the end of four years
of bearing abuse in silence, we

j finally hauled off and killed a man
yesterday for speaking of the Uni
versity's Memorial "Chapel." It is
not a chapel. No, it never was a
j chapel. It's a church. One, two,
three, four .... sock, and a thud.
The Associated Women Stu
dents of Rohle Hall had an all
campus dance, Saturday ni£ht.
Or had you noticed? A good or
chestra was enjoyed by all near
enough to hear it. And there
were red and green lights and
potted ferns, and every once in
a while when the Phi Kap house
got a little over-crowded, the
l overflow appeared in Roble
lobby. Then another sorority
had its formal, too. But they
Gwere nice people, and stayed
where they belonged.
Weak ones overheard at a Mili
j tary Ball:
"Can I look at the moon through
; the cannon, Wilbur?"
j "Then the horse got up, and I got
; up . . . ."
At the beginning of the last dance:
I "The decorations certainly are beau
tiful, in here."
