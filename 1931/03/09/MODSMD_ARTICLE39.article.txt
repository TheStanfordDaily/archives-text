### 
WASHINGTON, March 8. (TP)—
iln simple manner Justice Oliver
| Wendell Holmes today celebrated
! the 90th anniversary of his birthday.
The day found him in unusually
! good health.
The only deviation from the cus
j tomary simplicity of his life was a
j radio address—his first —delivered
I from his home over the Columbia
J broadcasting system.
The oldest man ever to serve as
I a Supreme Court justice spent the
! day in his red brick home on I
I street. The few intimate friends who
i called found him genial and cheer
' ful.
Among them were Felix Frank
furter, Harvard law professor, who
presented a volume of essays in
which the jurist was the central
theme. Members of the court also
! paid their respects.
