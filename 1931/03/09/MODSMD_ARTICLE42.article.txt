That track meet in the Stadium
Saturday afternoon proved quite a
disappointment, though the result
.vas no surprise. Compare it with
ast year, when the pre-meet dope
"lad the affuir figured as a toss-up,
tnd then Templeton's men came
hrough to win by ten points. Too
lad that Charley Kaster, George
Vlartin, Eric Krenz, Cy Leland,
{uss Sweet, and John Young could
lot have been with the Winged "O"
quad to test the mettle of the In
lians.

Usually an indication of (he
future prowess of Dink's ag
gregation, the 1931 meet pro
vided little more than entertain
ment for the scattering of spec
tators that was on hand. Of
course there was that heave of
Boh Jones, which was had news
t»i the up and coming young
discus-throwers at rival institu
tions. Another tiling which
should hring joy to the heart of
Robert L. was a little incident
(hat did not appear on all these
summaries you have read.
AI Ray tossed the javelin out no
'ss than 103 feet, but one spike
lade a mark on the foul line, there
y disqualifying the throw. Add
bout seven feet or more to that
id you have ?. mark that is right
p there in anybody's meet. If Zuger
in come out of bis slump and get
ick up to around 190, the distance
■ threw several weeks ago in prac
c:e, Templeton will have what he
is lacked for some time: a pair of
)ear-throwers.
As (o (he side show, (he l'C
lay may he said (o have fea
tured, (hough the 220 brought a
lot of laughs from the stands.
Ross Nichols, hurdler of note and
former track captain of Stan
ford. proved the outstanding
comedian of the day. Given a
130-yard lead as the first man
for (he Club in the relay, Nick
was put over on (he other side
of the oval all by himself, where
he succeeded in edging up about
(en more yards each (ime (he
judges turned their atten(ion (o
starling (he Stanford man at the
regular post.
Fans on the west side of the Sta

re waiting in suspense to see who
d the lead. Here came Hec Dyer
o sight all alone, and it looked for
moment as though he were the
]y entrant in the event. However,
