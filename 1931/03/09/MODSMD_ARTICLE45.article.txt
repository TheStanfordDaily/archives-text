# Cards Pound Out 13-1 Victory Over St. Marys
## JOHNSON PITCHES SUPERB BASEBALL IN GAEL MASSACRE Stanford Scores Six Runs During Fourth Canto; Rintala Homers 
### Francis Lloyd 
Violent strong-arm methods were
employed by the Stanford nine when
they battered the fighting Gaels into
' submission last Saturday to a
rhythmic thumping of 13-1. Allow
j ing St. Mary's only four hits, Dan
1 Johnson kept the Saints in cheek
while the Indians were carefully
placing the ball in the far corners
of the park.
I The festivities duly began in Stan-
I ford's half of the first inning, when
1 Hardy and Phiiippi got on with
i singles and advanced to third and
second on an error. The squeeze
plaj' was called with Hunken at bat,
ITardy scoring on a wiid pitch, and
then Hunken laid down a perfect
bunt to bring in Phiiippi.
Shove Six Across
Quiet remained on the local front
until the fourth inning, when the
Cards lost all sense of hospitality
and scored six runs, chasing Noonan,
the Gaels' starting pitcher, to the
showers. A homer by Rintala, a
triple by Phiiippi, and three singles
were the unsocial offerings of the
Indians.
Never really in danger, and with
the one run scored against him un
earned, Dan Johnson won his fourth
! conference victory in a most effi-
I cient manner. Issuing but one base
and fanning three of the Moragans,
I Johnsop was always master of the
situation.

' submission last Saturday to a
rhythmic thumping of 13-1. Allow
j ing St. Mary's only four hits, Dan
1 Johnson kept the Saints in cheek
while the Indians were carefully
placing the ball in the far corners
of the park.
I The festivities duly began in Stan-
I ford's half of the first inning, when
1 Hardy and Phiiippi got on with
i singles and advanced to third and
second on an error. The squeeze
plaj' was called with Hunken at bat,
ITardy scoring on a wiid pitch, and

Shove Six Across
Quiet remained on the local front
until the fourth inning, when the
Cards lost all sense of hospitality
and scored six runs, chasing Noonan,
the Gaels' starting pitcher, to the
showers. A homer by Rintala, a
triple by Phiiippi, and three singles
were the unsocial offerings of the
Indians.
