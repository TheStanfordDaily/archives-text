entirely abandoned after the smoke j
of the first four play-off battles has !

ties by meeting El Toro, champion
of league V, in the Pavilion at 7j

games will be matched against each i

' other tomorrow night and the two
survivors of these clashed will enter
the finals to be held next Thursday
• night, according to Parker Reed, di*-
j rector of intramural athletics.
Sigma Chi, 1930 champions, and
I Sequoia I, pre-season favorite for
! this year's title, are still the two
outstanding teams of the tourna
ment and, as such, are favored to
come through their games tonight
i with their undefeated records still
j unmarred. Both teams will not
' reach the finals however because by
' the luck of the draw they meet to
| morrow night if they are victorious
| in tonight's encounters,
j El Capitan, perhaps the third best
I team in the tournament, faces a big
hurdle in Sigma Nu, but because
' they have shown constant improve
! merit in every game and because
! they looked really impressive in
I trimming Breakers, 34-30, last Wed-
I nesday are favored to come through.
