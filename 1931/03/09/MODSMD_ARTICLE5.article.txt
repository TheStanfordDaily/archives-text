Senior Class to Attend
Representing the tribute of the
' undergraduates to Senator Stanford,
1 the senior class will attend the con
i cert in a body, occupying the 250 re
j served seats in the front of the
I church. This is one of the few ap-
I pearances of the seniors as a unit,
i and is a traditional feature of the
Founders' Day exercises.
Today is the 107 th anniversary of
i the birthday of Senator Stanford and
i the 40th Founders' Day. It was first
observed as Founders' Day in 1894,
a few months after the death of
Senator Stanford.
A University holiday used to be
granted, but due to the tendency
lof the students to go picnicking
rather than attend the lecture, this
1 custom was abolished.
This will be the second appearance
j of Dobrowen on the Stanford cam
i pus, his first concert having been
i given in the Pavilion on January
| 21. He will direct the following pro
| gram tonight:
[Brandenburg Concerto Bach
Symphony in E Flat Mozart
Trauermarch from "Die Gotter
dammerung" Wagner
Overture, "The Russian Easter"
i * Rimsky-Korsakov
