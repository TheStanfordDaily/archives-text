### 
Stanfoi'd's freshman trackmen
I dropped a dual meet to the Sacra
jmento Junior College -on the old
I oval Saturday morning by a score
>of 68-54.
With Jimmy Willson out of the
1 competition, the babes were far out
classed in the track events, dropping
first place in everything but the
high and low hurdles. Packard, who
! has only been practicing for a week,
' took the highs in the good time of
15.8; Meirs broke the tape in the
| lows.
I Although Van Dellen, premier
j freshman pole-vaulter, was unable
•to compete, Stanford's showing in
! the field events was much better,
j four first places falling to their lot.
j Lyman turned in the outstanding
: individual performance of the day
by getting the 16-pound shot out 48
' feet Vz inch, a mark which would
j have gotten him a place in the var
i sity meet, or in any Eastern college
