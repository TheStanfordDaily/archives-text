# STANFORD BOXERS LOSE TOURNAMENT TO BEAR MITTMEN
## Magid Wins Close Decision From Johnson; Miller Scores K.O. Win 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Before a crowd of rabid Berkeley
ring fans, a determined group of
California boxers came through with
four victories out of seven Friday
night in Harmon Gymnasium, and
Coach Harry Maloney's mittmen re
turned to the Farm with blasted
hopes lor an undefeated season.
The middleweight bout, in which
Nate Magid of California won an
extra-round decision from Captain
Fred Johnson of the Indians, was
the deciding point in the Stanford
defeat. After dropping his man to
the canvas once and chasing him
around the ropes most of the time,
Johnson was forced into a fourth
round by the judges' indecision.
Three Indians Win
Fred Glover, Dick Miller, and
Gordon Gilbert scored the Indian
victories on the card. Glover
swarmed all over the Bear feather,
Haig Dagdigian, for a clear victory,
as did Gilbert against Louie Hotopp
in the light-heavy bout.
Dick Miller, Stanford welter, made
short work of Dana Champion. Mil
ler landed right hooks to the body
and smashing lefts to the hond for
a technical K.O. early in the first
round.
Mallory Stops Driscol!
Tom Driscall of Stanford did well
in staying almost three rounds with
Milo Mallory, former national hea
vyweight amateur. In the third Ref
eree Percy Locey gave the Bear
boxer the decision on a T.K.O.
Mark Kai-Kee dropped the open
ing decision to the California ban
tam, Jim McMillan. Vance Rogers
was defeated by his former Berke
ley victim, Earl Stevens, in the
lightweight event.
