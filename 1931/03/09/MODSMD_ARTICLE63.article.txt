days," the Chancellor Emeritus re
called to his mind President Wilbur
as a "long-legged freshman" who
painted the "old post office back of
j the chapel all over with Stanford
| Red."
Musing over the bygone days, he
touched upon the German maxim
familiar to every Stanford student,
"der Luft die Freiheit Weht," taken
from Ulrich von Hutton's speech to
Luther's persecutors. He used the
phrase in one of his addresses, he
said, and Senator Stanford liked it
so well, it was decided to make it
the motto of the University.
A symphony concert was the of
ficial observance two years ago as
well as last year.
