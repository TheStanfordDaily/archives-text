# McDOUGALL LEADS REDSHIRT POLOISTS TO BRUIN VICTORY
## 
### 
Captain Jack McDougall made his
exit from college polo competition
in a blaze of glory Saturday, scor
ing seven goals as he led the Stan
ford four to a 14-1 victory over the
hard-working, but inexperienced
U.C.L.A. team.
Playing his usual position, No. 3,
McDougall was the mainstay of the
team, the rest of which was made
up of reserve players, but which
had no trouble in overwhelming the
visiting combination.
The Cardinals scored four goals
in the first chukker to start things
off with a bang and then kept up
the bombardment for the rest of the
game. McDougall provided a de
cisive conclusion to the tilt by mak
ing three scoi'es in the final chukker.
U.C.L.A. collected its lone point
in the third period when the Bruin
back, Westphal, drove in a free shot
after a foul by Carter.
