# Indian Track Team Wins Opening Meet From Olympic Club
## Stanford Outscores "Winged O" 88-42; Jones Tosses Discus 157 Feet; Eastman Runs 48.4 Quarter; Shot Putters Make Fine Showing 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
CANS who witnessed Dink Teinpleton's 1931 track team in action against
an Olympic Club aggregation weakened without the services of several
of its star performers, left the Stadium Saturday afternoon still wondering
what flie Indian stars would be capable of against real competition, for
the final score of the meet was Stanford, 88Vj>; Visitors, 42'/l*.
Only in the mighty toss of Bob Jones's, which sent the discus exactly
157 ft. 6% in. from the circle were track followers on the Farm given
anything to add to their dope sheets. Should Jones continue to improve
as rapidly as he has in early season, he may send the platter out beyond

'the 160 mark and help Dink to for
get all about the lately departed
Mr. Eric Krenz.
Two-Mile a Feature
Aside from the surprise furnished
by Jones, the feature of the meet
was the two-mile grind, which
found Gericke of the Club pushing
Paul Aebersold to the best time of
his career, 9:53.8. The lanky Olym
pian traded the lead with the Indian
star several times within the first six
laps until the pace began to tell and
he dropped back to lose by more
i than 100 yards.
Five clean sweeps were recorded
by Templeton's men: the shot, in
which Nellie Gray did his best this
season to win at 48 ft. 11 in.; the
; 880, where Wright and Cooper ran
a dead heat in 2:4 with Fullenwider
right at their heels; the low hurdles,
in which Smith, Nisbet, and Her
bert finished in that order; the dis
cus, where Laborde took second
i and George Grey third, and the 440,
in which the entire Indian relay
team led the one Club entry by
yards.
Bob Brown ran a good race in the
mile, though Carter of the Club won
the event in 4:25.4. The Cardinal
miler was no more than 10 yards
behind the leader, which means that
he must have shaded 4:30, something
he had failed to do previously this
season.
As expected, Podge Smith and
Hec Dyer each took two first places,
while Ben Eastman romped over
the finish line in the one-lap event
with a good six yards to spare.
The mile relay was awarded to
the Olympians, who managed to
stay in front of the Indian quartet
by reason of a 150-yard handicap.

Summary:
100-yard dash—Won by Dyer (S);
Lombardi (S), second; Davis (0)
and Ward (S), tied for third. Time,
10 flat.
220-yard dash—Won by Dyer (S);

third. Time, 21.9.

Five clean sweeps were recorded
by Templeton's men: the shot, in
which Nellie Gray did his best this
season to win at 48 ft. 11 in.; the
; 880, where Wright and Cooper ran
a dead heat in 2:4 with Fullenwider
right at their heels; the low hurdles,
in which Smith, Nisbet, and Her
bert finished in that order; the dis
cus, where Laborde took second
i and George Grey third, and the 440,
in which the entire Indian relay
team led the one Club entry by
yards.
Bob Brown ran a good race in the
mile, though Carter of the Club won
the event in 4:25.4. The Cardinal
miler was no more than 10 yards
behind the leader, which means that
he must have shaded 4:30, something
he had failed to do previously this
season.
As expected, Podge Smith and
Hec Dyer each took two first places,
while Ben Eastman romped over
the finish line in the one-lap event
with a good six yards to spare.
The mile relay was awarded to
the Olympians, who managed to
stay in front of the Indian quartet
by reason of a 150-yard handicap.

Summary:
100-yard dash—Won by Dyer (S);
Lombardi (S), second; Davis (0)
and Ward (S), tied for third. Time,
10 flat.
220-yard dash—Won by Dyer (S);
Davis (O), second; Granucci (O),
third. Time, 21.9.

MARSEILLES, France, March 8.
(fP) —France's entries for the Schnei
der cup races this summer will be
chosen from seven seaplanes now
under test on the Etang de Berre,
the vast lagoon at the mouth of the
Rhone.
CANS who witnessed Dink Teinpleton's 1931 track team in action against
an Olympic Club aggregation weakened without the services of several
of its star performers, left the Stadium Saturday afternoon still wondering
what flie Indian stars would be capable of against real competition, for
the final score of the meet was Stanford, 88Vj>; Visitors, 42'/l*.
Only in the mighty toss of Bob Jones's, which sent the discus exactly
157 ft. 6% in. from the circle were track followers on the Farm given
anything to add to their dope sheets. Should Jones continue to improve
as rapidly as he has in early season, he may send the platter out beyond

'the 160 mark and help Dink to for
get all about the lately departed
Mr. Eric Krenz.
Two-Mile a Feature
Aside from the surprise furnished
by Jones, the feature of the meet
was the two-mile grind, which
found Gericke of the Club pushing
Paul Aebersold to the best time of
his career, 9:53.8. The lanky Olym
pian traded the lead with the Indian
star several times within the first six
laps until the pace began to tell and
he dropped back to lose by more
i than 100 yards.
