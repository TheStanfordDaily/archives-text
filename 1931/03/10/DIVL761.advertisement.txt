COMPARE a package of Camels with
any other cigarette and note the
difference in the technique of packing.
Note that Camels are completely en
closed in an outer transparent cover of
moisture-proof cellophane and sealed
air-tight at every point.
We call this outer shell the Humidor
Pack. It differs from the ordinary cello
phane pack and while it is egg-shell
thin, it means a lot in terms of cigarette
enjoyment.

prevents the fine tobaccos of Camels
from drying out and losing any of their
delightful flavor.
Aside from cheap tobacco, two fac
tors in a cigarette can mar the smoker's
pleasure:
Fine particles of peppery dust if left
in the tobacco by inefficient cleaning
methods sting and irritate delicate
throat membrane.
Dry tobacco, robbed of its natural
moisture by scorching or by evapora

First of all you can feel the difference
as you roll the cigarettes between your
fingers. Camels are full-bodied and
pliable. A dry cigarette crumbles under
pressure and sheds tobacco.

actually hear the difference. •

And here's where the new Hxfmidor Pack
proves a real blessing to the smoker.
As you inhale the cool, fragrant smoke
from a Camel you get all the mildness

it is blended.
But when you draw in the hot smoke
from a dried cigarette see how flat and
brackish it is by comparison and how
harsh it is to your throat.
If you are a regular Camel smoker
you have already noticed what proper

But if you haven't tried Camels in

First of all you can feel the difference
as you roll the cigarettes between your
fingers. Camels are full-bodied and
pliable. A dry cigarette crumbles under

proves a real blessing to the smoker.
As you inhale the cool, fragrant smoke
from a Camel you get all the mildness

But when you draw in the hot smoke
from a dried cigarette see how flat and

harsh it is to your throat.
If you are a regular Camel smoker
you have already noticed what proper
