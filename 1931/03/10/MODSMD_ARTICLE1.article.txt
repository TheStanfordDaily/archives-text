### 
BELGRADE, Jugo Slavia, March
9. (J-P) —With the dead unofficially
reported at about 150, though some
rumors placed the number much
higher, the seriousness of earth
quakes during the week-end in the
region of the Jugo Slay, Bulgarian,
and Greek frontiers, bdgan to be
fully realized.
Communication with all the af
fected areas had not been re-estab
lished, but it was known that many
villages had been devastated, hun
dreds of peasants made homeless,
and bridges and railways ruined.
The suffering from cold and hunger
was widesread.
Relief work was handicapped by
the breakdown of communications
and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that food, medicine, and
warm clothing were taken into re
gions where it was most needed.
Estimated 600 Injured
Panic among the inhabitants con
tinued today as four new shocks
were felt. Altogether there have
been 34 tremors. It is estimated that
600 persons have been seriously in
jured and 12,000 are homeless.
Tales of horror and suffering are
told by those bringing the injured
on stretchers to Prilep and Botolj.
Due to a shortage of accommoda
tions many of the injured have to
be left on the cold streets while
awaiting attention of physicians.
At Demipabke and Gevghel in
the Vardar Valley motion picture
theatres collapsed and a railroad
bridge across the Vardar river fell.
The town of Valandovi was in ruins
and at Pirava every building was
damaged.
Cold Adds Suffering
King Alexander spent the whole
day traveling from one stricken
village to another encouraging the
sufferers and personally supervising
relief work.
Many of the simple peasants spent
last night and today in the open
braving the bitter cold because they
were afraid to go back in the build
ings left standing.
Refugees from some of the iso
lated regions straggled into Bel
grade with stories of terrifying phe
nomena.
