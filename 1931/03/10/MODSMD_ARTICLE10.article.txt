Favorites came through in last
night's intermural basketball play
when Sigma Chi won easily over
El Toro and Sequoia I downed the
Business School. In a fast finish El
Capitan took the measure of Sigma
Nu, while the Phi Kappas won on a
slender margin from the Dekes.
As a result Sigma Chi and Sequoia
I, the outstanding teams in the play
will meet tonight in the semi-finals,
and Phi Kappa Sigmas clash with
El Capitan.
Battle of Defenses
The Deke-Phi Kappa Sig struggle
was a battle of two stout defences,
with the Phi Kapps displaying a
superior passing attack to break
through the losers. Half time score
was 6to 3. After the half Phi Kappa
Sigma drew ahead with the Dekes
threatening in a furious finish, to
end the tussle 13 to 11.
Getts rang up 10 points to lead
Sequoia I against the Business
School. Sequoia presented the same
fast attack that has featured their
play all season, and early in the
game proved they were out for
blood. Bob Getts, at center had his
basket eye and his teammates fed
him well.
El Capitan Wins
El Capitan took an early lead from
Sigma Nu and were never troubled
during the first half, leading 12 to
6. Sigma Nu came out with a de
termined drive in the second period
and fought the club team on even
terms until with only a minute re
maining the victors clinched two
baskets to win 20 to 16.
The Sigma Chi-El Toro clash was
a tepid game. Toro offered little
resistance to the Sigma Chi attack
and the winners staged a veritable
field day. After leading 16 to 5 at
half time, Sigma Chi gained their
shooting eyes and began counting
up the points to finish 38 to 8.
