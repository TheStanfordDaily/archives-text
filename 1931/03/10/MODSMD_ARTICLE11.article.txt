# WORK RESUMED ON LEFT-HAND PILLAR OF DRIVE GATEWAY
## 
### 
The scaffolding tower which was
built recently to assist in the con
struction of the new Palm Drive
gateway has been fitted with a boom
and a small gasoline engine, and
workmen began yesterday to put in
place the first sandstone blocks of
the left-hand pillar.
The blocks are being built to form
hollow squares around the four
legs of the steel framework. The
hollow spaces between the stone and
the steel will be filled with rubble.
The four small pillars which are
thus being built will be the base
for the arches which will pass com
pletely through the pillars, allowing
passage for pedestrians along the
paths bordering the drive.
The structure above the arches
will be a solid mass with a core of
brick and facing of sandstone with
a red tiled roof in keeping with the
architecture of the rest of the build
ings on the campus.
