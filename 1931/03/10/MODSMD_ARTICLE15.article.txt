# CHAPPIE CROONS OF FAIR SPRING IN NEW NUMBER
## 
### 
QPRING, beautiful spring!
Chaparral croons such
sentiments as it presents its
latest issue, out tomorrow. With
a cover by Thorington Putnam,
the Old Boy's newest effort
teems with local color and sea
sonal spirit.
A page of art suggestions
from the none-too-educated
pens of the literary staff is a
feature of the issue, and an
article describing a meeting of
the men's council discussing
the honor system is forthcom
ing. A poem, "The Winds of
Freedom," will be printed, with
artistic embellishments by
Chappie's art editor, Berk
Anthony. The magazine is ed
ited by Burnell Gould.
Literary copy will be pre
sented by several new contri
butors, Larry Harris, Gordon
Steadman, Joe Wolf, and Ber
narr Bates, as well as from
Paul Lorton, Don Cameron,
Joe Thompson, and Burnell
Gould. Art work by Bob
Churchill, Jack Keerl, Frank
Clough, Thorington Putnam,
Berk Anthony, Jerry Arm
strong, and Mai Wliliams will
be seen.
