# SWAIN DENIES STATEMENT OF GENERAL DRIVE
## $1,250,000 For Medical School To Be Secured By Private Means 
### 
Reports that a general campaign
would be star-ted in the near future
to raise the $1,250,000 necessary be
fore the $2,500,000 offered Sunday
by an anonyAous donor will be
given to the University for a new
medical building in San Francisco,
were denied last night by Acting
President Robert Eckles Swain.
"Statements appearing in certain
San Francisco newspapers concern
ing a general drive were wholly un
authorized," said Swain. "No or
ganized campaign of solicitation is
contemplated at the present time in
behalf of this cause.
"It is expected that the funds
necessary to cover the $1,250,000 en
dowment contingent to the major
gift of $2,500,000 will be secured
largely, if not entirely, privately
from friends of the University in
terested in the development of medi
cal education on the Pacific Coast."
The $4,000,000 fund, if realized,
will be used to build a new build
ing fronting upon Buchanan street
between Clay and Sacramento
streets, a site that has been leveled
off already.
After the erection of this new
building, plans are that the old Lane
Hospital fronting upon Webster
street would be razed and the site
cleared for the erection at some fu
ture time of a new clinical hospital.
Plans originally called for the
erection on the Buchanan street site
of an addition to the Stanford hos
pital, a building fronting on Clay
street in this same block, but the
Lane Hospital was deemed inade
quate to meet the laboratory and
classroom requirements of the medi
cal school; hence, a new building for
school purposes on that site rather
than an annex to the hospital.
The $1,250,000 additional endow
ment must be raised within one
year before the $2,500,000 offer will
be presented to the University.
