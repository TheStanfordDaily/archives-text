# Lake Carnival May Not Take Place-- Waterman
## 
### 
Unless the storm clouds which
were piling up behind the campus
yesterday produce a substantial rain
fall, next quarter's water carnival
may be put off entirely or indefi
nitely postponed, according to Ed
waid H. Waterman, chief engineer.
Lagunita so far this quarter has
been completely dry. The water
which ordinarily fills it at this time
of year is taken from the surplus in
Searsville lake, but that body of wa
ter is far below its normal volume
this year.
Searsville and Felt lake, which is
an artificial reservoir, normally sup
ply the campus with all the water
needed for irrigation purposes as
well as the supply for swimming
pools and Lagunita. At the moment
the volume of water in Searsville
is only 93,000,000 gallons and that in
Felt lake only 58,000,000.
If the surplus in Searsville is not

sufficient to fill up Lagunita within
the next month there is very little
chance of its being filled at all dur
ing the next quarter, according to
Waterman.
That should not be discouraging,
however, he said yesterday, because
the lakes were far worse off last
year at the same time, and Lagunita
was filled up in time for the carnival
and the incidental swimming and
canoeing which the student body
has missed so far this quarter.
The low level of the water in the
lakes presents no danger for the
irrigation of the golf course, and
the filling of the campus swimming
pools. Even if Felt lake goes nearly
dry as it did last year this needed
water can be taken from Searsville
and if that supply fails the Uni
versity's system of wells is capable
of supplying sufficient water for all
the needs of the campus.
