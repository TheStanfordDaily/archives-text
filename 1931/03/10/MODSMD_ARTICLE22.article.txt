# Russ Proletariats Will Be Theme Of Next Junior Opera
## Lorton, Cameron, Well-Known Chaparral Humorists, Are Authors of Chosen Plot; Helvenston Is Retained to Direct Opera 
### 
Russian serfs, blithely tossing bombs about in the
shadows of Moscow buildingsâ€”the seething struggle in the heart of
Soviet Russia, is the unusual atmosphere of the '32 Junior Opera, "Prole
tariat Plus," written by Paul Lorton, '3l, and Don Cameron, '33, to be
presented April 17. Chosen yesterday by a committee under Frank Norris,
the plot is one of five submitted for final consideration in the annual plot
writing contest. Of the other four manuscripts, one was by Burnell Gould
and three by collaborators: August Fruge and Bob Piercy, Dick Webb

and Jack Owens, and Krai Karnopp.
Lorton and Cameron are well
known for their literary work, both
being members of the Chaparral
staff. Lorton is a member of Ram's
Head, Honorary Dramatic Society,
and both authors belong to national
honorary journalistic societies, Sig
ma Delta Chi and Hammer and Cof
fin.
