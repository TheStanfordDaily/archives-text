# Sweater Awards May Be 'V' Neck Style This Year
## Contract With Mills Makes Change Difficult 
### 
Athletes may have to accept "V"
neck sweaters as athletic awards in
spite of the new A.S.S.U. by-laws,
according to A1 Masters, Graduate
Manager of the Board of Athletic
Control and Tom Pike, president of
the student body.
In a communication from A1 Mas
ters, Pike learned that a year's con
tract to produce cardinal colored
"V" neck sweaters was made with
the Olympia Knitting Mills last fall.
Until this contract has expired the
Board of Athletic Control will not
be able to make letter awards with
the open front sweater as prescribed
by the new by-laws.
The graduate manager added that
there is a possibility that the open
front sweater may be procured pro
viding the knitting company has not
already manufactured the "V" neck
sweaters. At present, Masters is
making every effort to obtain the
type of sweaters called for.
In event that the open front
sweaters are obtained, they will
probably be made of the heavy qual
ity wool because of the contract
now in force, Masters said. Next
season the lighter quality wool will
be specified.
Masters added that next year the
B.A.C. will be able to make the
sweater contracts so that they. will
comply with the new A.S.S.U. by
laws.
Hearty approval of the new award
system was expressed by Masters.
