to the brink of disaster.

who called the meeting, said a
statement of the outcome would be
made when the session adjourned.
He said it appeared the confer

that Would conserve oil now under
ground, and at the same time bol
ster a slipping market made adverse
by disorderly production and im
portations of foreign crude oil to a
market already overloaded.
The states represented were Okla

Wyoming, and California.
