A week ago the Men's and Women's Councils an
nounced a definite, firm policy which the Councils would
follow in cases of violation of the Honor Code. They pro
posed a minimum penalty of three quarters' suspension
from the University for convicted violators, a maximum
policy and automatically effective in second offenses—
of permanent expulsion from the University.
The policy was excellent; the question remaining in the
minds of intelligent critics of the Honor Code was whether
the Councils would be vigorous in carrying out the policy.
The test came in the cases of four alleged yiolators of the
Code. They were dried Friday; two students, a man and a
woman, were found guilty.
The punishment of those two students, the Councils
decided, will he, not the three quarter minimum penalty,
hut a two quarter suspension, which will indeed he only
50 per cent effective, as summer quarter will he counted
in the penalty.
The Councils failed in the test. It takes backbone to
take a firm stand on a policy; it takes more strength to
remain firm in carrying out a policy. The action of the
Councils last Friday virtually repudiated their action of
the week before. Their "minimum" penalty of three quar
ters' suspension is a farce, since they decline to make it
effective.
The flimsy excuse that the , offenses were committed
before the Councils announced their policy will not stand.
The offenses were violations of the Code; the Councils
decided that violations of the Code deserved 'at least three
quarters' suspension. They had the power to sentence vio
lators to three quarters' suspension before the announce
ment of their policy; they had that power last October.
The situation is simply this: Stanford has a pair of
student councils which lack the strength to act in a crucial
test of their announced policies. Last week, a hold front. . .
this week, we see behind it weakness and failure.
