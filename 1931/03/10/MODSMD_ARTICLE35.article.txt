# A 						STATEMENT OF POLICY
## 
### 
Whatever fears there were that the University was
planning a general alumni drive to raise the $1,250,000
endowment, provided for in the contingent gift for the
School of Medicine announced Sunday, were dispelled yes
terday in the emphatic denial by Acting President Swain
of any such intentions on the part of the administration.
Dr. Swain declared: "No organized campaign of solici
tation among alumni is contemplated at the present time
in behalf of this cause. It is expected that the funds neces
sary to cover the endowment of $1,250,000 contingent to
the major gift of $2,500,000 will lie secured largely, if not
entirely, privately from friends of the University interested
in the development of medical education on the Pacific
Coast."
Stanford's acting president is to he commended on this
clear statement of policy. It would be indeed unfortunate
in a year of depression such as the present one to institute
a general subscription campaign, and especially for the
interest of a single unit of tfie University. Such a campaign
would drain the alumni of available funds which might be
intended for the main Stanford endowment and instead
would be used solely for the School of Medicine.
The School of Medicine is one of the finest divisions of
the University, and the generous offer of the anonymous
donor will, when the necessary endowment is raised, place
it in a secure position financially. But it is well that the
matter of obtaining this endowment is to be left to those
friends of Stanford genuinely interested in the advance
ment of medical education in this region.'
While on the subject of the wonderful offer made the
School of Medicine, the DAILY, for itself and for the Asso
ciated Students, would like to thank the magnanimous
donor. His act marks him as a real friend of education.
