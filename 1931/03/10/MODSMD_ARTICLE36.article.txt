In the adjoining Campus Opinion column comes a plea
from a devotee of handball for better facilities for the
sport on the campus.
The Board of Athletic Control would do well to con
sider the writer's suggestion that two four-wall courts be
erected as soon as possible, rather than wait until funds
are available, some time in the far-off future, to build a
number of courts.
As a team representing Stanford in intercollegiate com
petition, the members of the handball squad are deserving
of practice courts that will enable them to compete on
equal terms with their opponents* Not only does the team
merit consideration in this respect, but the sport is one of
widespread popularity throughout the University, and
money expended to facilitate and encourage general par
ticipation in it would be well spent indeed.
