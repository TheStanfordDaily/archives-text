SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.
The last pair of concerts on Fri
day and Sunday featured Jose
Iturbi in two piano concertos. He
first played a Mozart Concerto,
which he the delicacy
and precision necessary to a classical
number. In the Liszt Concerto which
followed, the audience was shown
another side of the brilliant Span
iard's character. Here he was play
ing music as bombastic as the Mo
zart was delicate—music filled with
bewildering technical difficulties
and requiring a great' deal of force.
And while, in the opinion of this
reviewer, the Liszt Concerto was not
as enjoyable as the Mozart, the dif
ference lay in the compositions, not
the rendition.
Mr. Dobrowen presented a grace
ful rendition of Brahms' Third Sym
phony. The mellow, flowing charac
ter of the composition was brought
out in contrast to occasional sharp
angular climaxes.
Next Sunday Gregor Piatiagorsky
will play the Dvorak cello concerto,
apd the orchestra will offer a sym
phony of Borodin. N. B.

BIG MONEY. By P. G. Wodehouse.
Dodd, Mead. $2. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Whenever Wodehouse writes a
new novel, it means a couple of
hours of the finest pleasure for those
v/ho are able to wrest a copy from
some owner, bookstore, or library.
The humor of this Englishman never
disappoints.
"Big Money" is well qualified to
take its place with the rest of the
Wodehouse gems. Here is another
unbelievably complicated plot; six
or eight characters as human as they
are amusing; quantities of delicious
ly apt description; and abundant
passages of some of the funniest dia
logue that even Wodehouse has ever
written.
Wodehousian disciples should
seize the first occasion to meet the
Biscuit and Bery and Ann and J. B.
Hoke, to say nothing of the rest of
them. If by any chance, you don't
know Wodehouse, "Big Money" pro
vides excellent opportunity to make
his acquaintance. —B. B. D.

CIMARRON At the California
Theatre.
Cimarron is enjoyable as well as
impressive—a pleasing variation of
the motion picture "epic."
The development of the Cherokee
Strip in Oklahoma forms the back

j ground for two interesting figures.
I Richard Dix plays the two-gun edi
j tor of a newspaper in Osage, first
| town in the new territory. Irene
i Dunne, playing his wife, takes major
| honors. When her husband plisap
: pears, she continues to run his
! newspaper, and after fifteen years
i of battling alone, is elected to Con
l gress; which occasion is tinged with
I irony by tragic news.
| No second "Covered Wagon" is
i this; it combines the epic feature
| with a story of two very human peo
! pie who remain loyal to each other
! through years of separation. The
| picture is a bit jerky, but satisfying.

| THE ROYAL FAMILY OF BROAD
| WAY—At the Varsity Theatre
i tomorrow.
i In true style, the Palo Alto the
! atre managers have clumped two of
j the better pictures of the season on
j the same days at the local picture
| houses. Best of any is "The Royal
j Family of Broadway," the fastest,
! most riotous comedy-drama to be
screened for montl*.
Whether you saw the play or not,
the cinema version is worth an audi
ence. With Frederic March taking
over the show on every entrance
with his interpretation of Tony
Cavendish, and with Ina Claire
shining bright as his sister Julie,
no one could be bored at this flicker.
Henrietta Crosman plays the
"grand old lady of the stage" well,
and the tempestous home life of the
family of actors is ably transferred
to the screen. Hollywood changed
the ending, in order that Miss Claire
might have the last line, but almost
reaches the perfect climax attained
in the stage version.

STOLEN HEAVEN. —At the Stan
ford Theatre tomorrow.
For those who can imagine Nancy
Carroll as nothing but a saccharine
singer of "cute" songs, we recom
mend an early visit to "Stolen
Heaven" where ghe takes a dramatic
role and proves her ability as one
of the screen's significant actresses.
The opening sequence in her dingy
room where she has brought an un
known young man is as good a
portrayal as anything you could see.
The picture develops interestingly,
and Phillips Holmes is adequate as
leading man. If you were lucky
enough to see "Laughter," you will
want to see this current production.
It's the same type- of smart enter
tainment attained seldom in the
talkies. —J. T.
