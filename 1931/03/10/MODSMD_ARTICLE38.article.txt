The Editor, Sir:
Now that the Stanford handball j
team has decisively defeated the ;
California varsity, thereby proving j
its right to at least some recogni- \
tion, I would like to review the |
situation and make a suggestion. j
Each year the Stanford four-wall ;
team, consisting of seven men, is j
selected, and a series of matches are j
played, culminating in a tournament j
with California. As to whether or j
not there is any interest manifested |
in this sport it is .quite apparent
when it is recalled that last year the
student body voted this sport an
award—that this year 31 men tried
out for the varsity team —and that
for the last five weeks the team has
traveled to San Jose either two or
three times a week, at their own
expense, in order to practice and
develop teamwork. It is hardly con
ceivable that a university that gives
an award, that manifests such in- ;
terest in a sport, and develops a j
team that defeats its arch rival, j
should have absolutely no facilities ,
for the sport on its own campus.
The members of the team only j
think of handball courts in the form i
of a mirage. There are beautiful j
blueprints, prepared years ago, for j
many courts. The program, I be
lieve, is to build this long row of
many box courts when sufficient
money is available —which is a long
way off if one is to judge from past

ADEQUATE HANDBALL COURTS ARE NEEDED

! records. My suggestion is this: Build
j only two courts now, not temporary,
! but permanent ones, later adding
j more courts as funds become more
! plentiful. Four-wall handball courts
! consist of only four walls, a roof,
i and floor, the cost of which is nomi
nal.
I Handball is one of the few snorts
| that a student can play in after
! college days, and there is not one
representative athletic club in the
United States that does not have a
bank' of courts that are continually
in use. The University of California
has one bank of? courts and is get
ting ready to construct a second.
U.S.C. has just completed five new
courts, and the same is true at all
the other large institutions. Stan
ford's team has defeated San JoSe
Y.M.C.A., St. Ignatius, Santa Clara,
and California, and I think the least
that can be done is to afford the
men a place to practice on the cam
! pus. —L. S. McElwain, '31.
