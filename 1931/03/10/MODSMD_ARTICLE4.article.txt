# ANCIENT VEHICLE DESERTS SEQUOIA FOR CAMERAMAN

\TO longer will the wheezy
* chug of a one-lunger add to
the general din at Sequoia Hall.
Norman Booth Knox, of
London, an upper-classman
now rooming within the quiet
walls of said peaceful retreat,
has sold his 1907, model one
cylinder chain drive Hispano
Suisa horseless carriage for the
princely sum of $5O.
Originally worth thousands
of dollars, the once proud pa
triarch of the pavements will
now serve in the lowly capacity
of photographer's assistant at
a San Francisco beach. It will
be used as a novelty back
ground for undignified merry
makers' pictures.
