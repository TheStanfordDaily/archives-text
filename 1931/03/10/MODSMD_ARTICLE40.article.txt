# Cabbages and Things ..

### 
Today it's a swan song, a till-we
meet-again, if any. The poor old
Daily is tired, and is taking a cou
ple of weeks' vacation, incidentally
cramming to absorb and fill a few
blue books with knowledge. Wish
us luck. We know you all know a
lot already.
There's something awfully path
etic about this Spring. Things you're
losing always seem most beautiful
and appealing, and maybe that's
why. It's a lovely old place, even
though stopping at campus arterials
is still a horrible waste of time.

Just a couple of tips about
the over-vacation rushing all
you men are so interested in:
Something in favor of the Delts,
| the Phi Psis and and the Sigma Nus
| is that if your engine is hard to
start, in the mornings, you can roll
down from those houses, and reach
Quad by the time the prof is dis
missing your nine o'clock.
Nothing is leaking out about
Beta designs on the freshmen.
They're having a new roof put
on their house.
| Certainly is a relief to know that
j someone on the globe thinks enough
| of us to donate a couple of million
j dollars for improved methods of
j cutting people up and putting them
! together again. The string attached
: is that we have to raise a little
I counter-sum, ourselves. Start sav
| ing tinfoil immediately! We'd sug
i gest another kissing-booth idea, for
! anything but a hospital fund, but
! kissing is unhealthy, and ....
Now a parting shot, the last
one we'll ever pull in this col
; yum. Our roommate, the inevi
i table target for abuse and ex
cuse for all that we like to con
i sider funny, suggests that when
your stomach growls hungrily
| at 11:17 A.M., you're having an
organ recital. How about it?
So saying, we hand over the dunce
cap and the official C. and T. type
writer to an able and thus far un
suspecting successor at this game.
May he have luck. And all of you,
too.
