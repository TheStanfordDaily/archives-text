# PRINCETON HONOR SYSTEM SUCCESS DEFINED BY DEAN
## Use Of Pledges, Reporting Of All Violations Is Advocated 
### Dean Christian Gauss Princeton University 
(Princeton University has tried
the honor system for 37 years, and
found it an outstanding success. In
the following article, condensed
from the New York Times, the dean
of the college there discusses the
system and and the undergraduate
ethics it involves.—Editor.)

Honor systems vary so widely
among themselves that it is difficult
to make any one definition which
will include them all. For the pur
pose of focusing discussion, in spite
of the risks involved, I am, how
ever, rash enough to propose the
following system: An honor system
is a system conducted by under
graduates which makes explicit the
obligation of the student not to re
sort to dishonesty and provides the
agencies to try the cases of violators
and impose the necessary penalties.
The range of activities covered by
the system may be more or less ex
tensive, but every honor system in
variably covers dishonesty in ex
aminations.
In all discussions of the subject
it is not only the details of the sys
tem that are attacked, but the very
conception itself. Conscientious ob
jectors begin their attack with an
argument difficult to answer. Any
such system, they hold, is superero
gatory. The obligation not to cheat
is already implied in all human re
lationships. The ordinary laws of
morality cover it. Why, then, im--
pose a system upon a situation
where the obligation already clearly
exists?
Let us admit for the sake of argu
ment that in theory this objection
■ is unanswerable; and taking the im
plications at their worst, admit also,
as in that case we must, that an
honor system thus becomes merely
an artificial aid to undergraduate
honesty. Let us turn, then, to the
simpler, practical phases of the
question.
In a university which, from the
standpoint of general morale, ranks
among the very best of the country,
leading undergraduates have recent
ly declared, for instance, that fully
one-half of their fellows are guilty
of dishonesty in examinations.
Cheating Aids
A good many years ago I hap
pened to be at a university where
tfiere was no honor system. It was
the period of the mid-year examina
tions, and it fell at the time of a
late January thaw. A few days after
the examination in a required
course, an undergraduate, of ihe
very best traditions and previous
training, asked me whether I had
noticed that nearly all of the stu
dents had come in rubber boots. The
reason- they wore boots, he ex
plained, was a simple one. They had
copied important formulae, prob
lems, and other necessary material
upon the inside of their boots,
which, in the warmth of the room,
could be turned down to the neces
sary place without suspicion.
He insisted that at least 80 per
cent of his classmates had indulged
in the practice, and as the majority
were doing it, he assured me that
the practice, having become student
custom, aroused no resentment.
Whether or not there may have
been some exaggeration in this ac
count, alumni of any number of in
stitutions, many of them of other
wise high standing, will tell you
that in their time, in connection
with certain examinations, some
what similar conditions prevailed.
Pledge Employed
The most frequent means em
ployed to make explicit the obliga
tion not to cheat in examinations is
some form of pledge. At Princeton
the system requires that every stu
dent sign" upon his examination
paper: "I pledge my honor as a gen
tleman that during this examina
tion I have neither given nor re
ceived assistance."
Where such a system is in opera
tion, in practice the most serious
difficulty is to persuade the under
graduates to observe this obligation
which the system itself imposes. In
case an undergraduate in the course
of an examination observes another
student violating his pledge, he is
bound to report him to the under
graduate committee in charge. This
difficulty must be faced squarely.
Where undergraduates are unwilling
to do this, and where from the un
dergraduates' standpoint no stigma
is attached to the violation of the
pledge, an honor system, however
desirable in the abstract, is, in the
opinion of many critics, impossible.
Cheating Game
Only too many undergraduates
feel that to outwit the professor or
proctors is the same kind of game
that is played when the sophomore
steals the sign by outwitting the
policeman. The professor and the
proctor do not belong to the under
graduates' crowd.
Successful honor systems, enlist
ing the support of this gang moral
ity, utilize it to prevent such cheat
ing. For this reason, it is impossible
for any faculty to impose an honor
system from above. It can only be
successful where it has the whole
hearted undergraduate support, and
it is is probably for this reason that
the honor systems which have been
most successful through a long
series of years are those which have
been started by undergraduates
themselves in colleges like the Uni
versity of Virginia and Princeton,

where the sense of campus solidarity
has been strong.
Student Task

The psychology of undergraduates
being what it is, it is futile, as I
see it, to expect an honor system
to receive the necessary support
from the students unless the whole
question of honesty in examinations
is turned over to them, lock, stock,
and barrel, without any reservations
whatever by the faculty. Unless a
faculty is prepared to do this with
the fullest confidence, they should
not attempt to persuade undergradu
ates to take part in an honor sys
tem; and unless the undergraduates
are willing to accept the very heavy
responsibilities involved, they should
not request to be relieved of what
they call the indignities of the proc
toring system.
It is, of course, disagreeable to
have to report a fellow-student. Un
dergraduates cannot be expected to
report him to an alien group like
the faculty. They must, however,
report him to his equals, and their
predicament here is much the same
as that of members of a club who
realize that one of their fellows has
been guilty of conduct that seriously
reflects upon the honor and good
name of their club.
Penalties Severe
The penalty where a student is
guilty must be severe. Cheating in
examinations becomes for an under
graduate quite as serious a matter
as cheating at cards for a member
of a club. Both cheaters, if de
tected, are dishonorably dismissed
and a stigma is attached to both.
That, at least, is involved in the
honor system as it exists at Prince
ton. It was established there 37
years ago just because a large body
of the undergraduates became so
thoroughly disgusted with the
amount of cheating that was then
taking place that they requested
permission of the faculty to take
charge of the whole matter. That
permission was granted. The under
graduate committee which was then
set up, and which includes the presi
dents of the four classes and three
other members, has had complete
jurisdiction of honesty in examina
tions ever since; and they have dis
charged their trust so successfully
that the honor system has become
the most highly cherished of all the
traditions of the college.
I believe that my opinion will be
shared by all my colleagues at

Princeton when I add that no col
lege tradition or custom that I know
of has a more favorable effect upon
general undergraduate morale than
a successful honor system.

upon the inside of their boots,
which, in the warmth of the room,
could be turned down to the neces
sary place without suspicion.
He insisted that at least 80 per
cent of his classmates had indulged
in the practice, and as the majority
were doing it, he assured me that
the practice, having become student
custom, aroused no resentment.
Whether or not there may have
been some exaggeration in this ac
count, alumni of any number of in
stitutions, many of them of other
wise high standing, will tell you
that in their time, in connection
with certain examinations, some
what similar conditions prevailed.
Pledge Employed
The most frequent means em
ployed to make explicit the obliga
tion not to cheat in examinations is
some form of pledge. At Princeton
the system requires that every stu
dent sign" upon his examination
paper: "I pledge my honor as a gen
tleman that during this examina
tion I have neither given nor re
ceived assistance."
Where such a system is in opera
tion, in practice the most serious
difficulty is to persuade the under
graduates to observe this obligation
which the system itself imposes. In
case an undergraduate in the course
of an examination observes another
student violating his pledge, he is
bound to report him to the under
graduate committee in charge. This
difficulty must be faced squarely.
Where undergraduates are unwilling
to do this, and where from the un
dergraduates' standpoint no stigma
is attached to the violation of the
pledge, an honor system, however
desirable in the abstract, is, in the
opinion of many critics, impossible.
Cheating Game
Only too many undergraduates
feel that to outwit the professor or
proctors is the same kind of game
that is played when the sophomore
steals the sign by outwitting the
policeman. The professor and the
proctor do not belong to the under
graduates' crowd.
Successful honor systems, enlist
ing the support of this gang moral
ity, utilize it to prevent such cheat
ing. For this reason, it is impossible
for any faculty to impose an honor
system from above. It can only be
successful where it has the whole
hearted undergraduate support, and
it is is probably for this reason that
the honor systems which have been
most successful through a long
series of years are those which have
been started by undergraduates
themselves in colleges like the Uni
versity of Virginia and Princeton,

where the sense of campus solidarity
has been strong.
Student Task

The psychology of undergraduates
being what it is, it is futile, as I
see it, to expect an honor system
to receive the necessary support
from the students unless the whole
question of honesty in examinations
is turned over to them, lock, stock,
and barrel, without any reservations
whatever by the faculty. Unless a
faculty is prepared to do this with
the fullest confidence, they should
not attempt to persuade undergradu
ates to take part in an honor sys
tem; and unless the undergraduates
are willing to accept the very heavy
responsibilities involved, they should
not request to be relieved of what
they call the indignities of the proc
toring system.
It is, of course, disagreeable to
have to report a fellow-student. Un
dergraduates cannot be expected to
report him to an alien group like
the faculty. They must, however,
report him to his equals, and their
predicament here is much the same
as that of members of a club who
realize that one of their fellows has
been guilty of conduct that seriously
reflects upon the honor and good
name of their club.
Penalties Severe
The penalty where a student is
guilty must be severe. Cheating in
examinations becomes for an under
graduate quite as serious a matter
as cheating at cards for a member
of a club. Both cheaters, if de
tected, are dishonorably dismissed
and a stigma is attached to both.
That, at least, is involved in the
honor system as it exists at Prince
ton. It was established there 37
years ago just because a large body
of the undergraduates became so
thoroughly disgusted with the
amount of cheating that was then
taking place that they requested
permission of the faculty to take
charge of the whole matter. That
permission was granted. The under
graduate committee which was then
set up, and which includes the presi
dents of the four classes and three
other members, has had complete
jurisdiction of honesty in examina
tions ever since; and they have dis
charged their trust so successfully
that the honor system has become
the most highly cherished of all the
traditions of the college.
I believe that my opinion will be
shared by all my colleagues at

Princeton when I add that no col
lege tradition or custom that I know
of has a more favorable effect upon
general undergraduate morale than
a successful honor system.
(Princeton University has tried
the honor system for 37 years, and
found it an outstanding success. In
the following article, condensed
from the New York Times, the dean
of the college there discusses the
system and and the undergraduate
ethics it involves.—Editor.)

Honor systems vary so widely
among themselves that it is difficult
to make any one definition which
will include them all. For the pur
pose of focusing discussion, in spite
of the risks involved, I am, how
ever, rash enough to propose the
following system: An honor system
is a system conducted by under
graduates which makes explicit the
obligation of the student not to re
sort to dishonesty and provides the
agencies to try the cases of violators
and impose the necessary penalties.
The range of activities covered by
the system may be more or less ex
tensive, but every honor system in
variably covers dishonesty in ex
aminations.
In all discussions of the subject
it is not only the details of the sys
tem that are attacked, but the very
conception itself. Conscientious ob
jectors begin their attack with an
argument difficult to answer. Any
such system, they hold, is superero
gatory. The obligation not to cheat
is already implied in all human re
lationships. The ordinary laws of
morality cover it. Why, then, im--
pose a system upon a situation
where the obligation already clearly
exists?
Let us admit for the sake of argu
ment that in theory this objection
■ is unanswerable; and taking the im
plications at their worst, admit also,
as in that case we must, that an
honor system thus becomes merely
an artificial aid to undergraduate
honesty. Let us turn, then, to the
simpler, practical phases of the
question.
In a university which, from the
standpoint of general morale, ranks
among the very best of the country,
leading undergraduates have recent
ly declared, for instance, that fully
one-half of their fellows are guilty
of dishonesty in examinations.
Cheating Aids
A good many years ago I hap
pened to be at a university where
tfiere was no honor system. It was
the period of the mid-year examina
tions, and it fell at the time of a
late January thaw. A few days after
the examination in a required
course, an undergraduate, of ihe
very best traditions and previous
training, asked me whether I had
noticed that nearly all of the stu
dents had come in rubber boots. The
reason- they wore boots, he ex
plained, was a simple one. They had
copied important formulae, prob
lems, and other necessary material
upon the inside of their boots,
which, in the warmth of the room,
could be turned down to the neces
sary place without suspicion.
He insisted that at least 80 per

is turned over to them, lock, stock,
and barrel, without any reservations
whatever by the faculty. Unless a
faculty is prepared to do this with
the fullest confidence, they should
not attempt to persuade undergradu
ates to take part in an honor sys
tem; and unless the undergraduates
are willing to accept the very heavy
responsibilities involved, they should
not request to be relieved of what
they call the indignities of the proc
toring system.
It is, of course, disagreeable to
have to report a fellow-student. Un
dergraduates cannot be expected to
report him to an alien group like
the faculty. They must, however,
report him to his equals, and their
predicament here is much the same
as that of members of a club who
realize that one of their fellows has
been guilty of conduct that seriously
reflects upon the honor and good
name of their club.
Penalties Severe
The penalty where a student is
guilty must be severe. Cheating in
examinations becomes for an under
graduate quite as serious a matter
as cheating at cards for a member
of a club. Both cheaters, if de
tected, are dishonorably dismissed
and a stigma is attached to both.
That, at least, is involved in the
honor system as it exists at Prince
ton. It was established there 37
years ago just because a large body
of the undergraduates became so
thoroughly disgusted with the
amount of cheating that was then
taking place that they requested
permission of the faculty to take
charge of the whole matter. That
permission was granted. The under
graduate committee which was then
set up, and which includes the presi
dents of the four classes and three
other members, has had complete
jurisdiction of honesty in examina
tions ever since; and they have dis
charged their trust so successfully
that the honor system has become
the most highly cherished of all the
traditions of the college.
I believe that my opinion will be
shared by all my colleagues at

Princeton when I add that no col
lege tradition or custom that I know
of has a more favorable effect upon
general undergraduate morale than
a successful honor system.
(Princeton University has tried
the honor system for 37 years, and
found it an outstanding success. In
the following article, condensed
from the New York Times, the dean
of the college there discusses the
system and and the undergraduate
ethics it involves.—Editor.)

Honor systems vary so widely
among themselves that it is difficult
to make any one definition which
will include them all. For the pur
pose of focusing discussion, in spite
of the risks involved, I am, how
ever, rash enough to propose the
following system: An honor system
is a system conducted by under
graduates which makes explicit the
obligation of the student not to re
sort to dishonesty and provides the
agencies to try the cases of violators
and impose the necessary penalties.
The range of activities covered by
the system may be more or less ex
tensive, but every honor system in
variably covers dishonesty in ex
aminations.
In all discussions of the subject
it is not only the details of the sys
tem that are attacked, but the very
conception itself. Conscientious ob
jectors begin their attack with an
argument difficult to answer. Any
such system, they hold, is superero
gatory. The obligation not to cheat
is already implied in all human re
lationships. The ordinary laws of
morality cover it. Why, then, im--
pose a system upon a situation
where the obligation already clearly
exists?
Let us admit for the sake of argu
ment that in theory this objection
■ is unanswerable; and taking the im
plications at their worst, admit also,
as in that case we must, that an
honor system thus becomes merely
an artificial aid to undergraduate
honesty. Let us turn, then, to the
simpler, practical phases of the
question.
In a university which, from the
standpoint of general morale, ranks
among the very best of the country,
leading undergraduates have recent
ly declared, for instance, that fully
one-half of their fellows are guilty
of dishonesty in examinations.
Cheating Aids
A good many years ago I hap
pened to be at a university where
tfiere was no honor system. It was
the period of the mid-year examina
tions, and it fell at the time of a
late January thaw. A few days after
the examination in a required
course, an undergraduate, of ihe
very best traditions and previous
training, asked me whether I had
noticed that nearly all of the stu
dents had come in rubber boots. The
reason- they wore boots, he ex
plained, was a simple one. They had
copied important formulae, prob
lems, and other necessary material
upon the inside of their boots,
which, in the warmth of the room,
could be turned down to the neces
sary place without suspicion.
He insisted that at least 80 per
cent of his classmates had indulged
in the practice, and as the majority
were doing it, he assured me that
the practice, having become student
custom, aroused no resentment.
Whether or not there may have
been some exaggeration in this ac
count, alumni of any number of in
stitutions, many of them of other
wise high standing, will tell you
that in their time, in connection
with certain examinations, some
what similar conditions prevailed.
Pledge Employed
The most frequent means em
ployed to make explicit the obliga
tion not to cheat in examinations is
some form of pledge. At Princeton
the system requires that every stu
dent sign" upon his examination
paper: "I pledge my honor as a gen
tleman that during this examina
tion I have neither given nor re
ceived assistance."
Where such a system is in opera
tion, in practice the most serious
difficulty is to persuade the under
graduates to observe this obligation
which the system itself imposes. In
case an undergraduate in the course
of an examination observes another
student violating his pledge, he is
bound to report him to the under
graduate committee in charge. This
difficulty must be faced squarely.
Where undergraduates are unwilling
to do this, and where from the un
dergraduates' standpoint no stigma
is attached to the violation of the
pledge, an honor system, however
desirable in the abstract, is, in the
opinion of many critics, impossible.
Cheating Game
Only too many undergraduates
feel that to outwit the professor or
proctors is the same kind of game
that is played when the sophomore
steals the sign by outwitting the
policeman. The professor and the
proctor do not belong to the under
graduates' crowd.
Successful honor systems, enlist
ing the support of this gang moral
ity, utilize it to prevent such cheat
ing. For this reason, it is impossible
for any faculty to impose an honor
system from above. It can only be
successful where it has the whole
hearted undergraduate support, and
it is is probably for this reason that
the honor systems which have been
most successful through a long
series of years are those which have
been started by undergraduates
themselves in colleges like the Uni
versity of Virginia and Princeton,

where the sense of campus solidarity
has been strong.
Student Task

The psychology of undergraduates
being what it is, it is futile, as I
see it, to expect an honor system
to receive the necessary support
from the students unless the whole
question of honesty in examinations
is turned over to them, lock, stock,
and barrel, without any reservations
whatever by the faculty. Unless a
faculty is prepared to do this with
the fullest confidence, they should
not attempt to persuade undergradu

obligation of the student not to re
sort to dishonesty and provides the
agencies to try the cases of violators
and impose the necessary penalties.
The range of activities covered by
the system may be more or less ex
tensive, but every honor system in
variably covers dishonesty in ex
aminations.
In all discussions of the subject
it is not only the details of the sys
tem that are attacked, but the very
conception itself. Conscientious ob
jectors begin their attack with an
argument difficult to answer. Any
such system, they hold, is superero
gatory. The obligation not to cheat
is already implied in all human re
lationships. The ordinary laws of
morality cover it. Why, then, im--
pose a system upon a situation
where the obligation already clearly
exists?
Let us admit for the sake of argu
ment that in theory this objection
■ is unanswerable; and taking the im
plications at their worst, admit also,
as in that case we must, that an
honor system thus becomes merely
an artificial aid to undergraduate
honesty. Let us turn, then, to the
simpler, practical phases of the
question.
In a university which, from the
standpoint of general morale, ranks
among the very best of the country,
leading undergraduates have recent
ly declared, for instance, that fully
one-half of their fellows are guilty
of dishonesty in examinations.
Cheating Aids
A good many years ago I hap
pened to be at a university where
tfiere was no honor system. It was
the period of the mid-year examina
tions, and it fell at the time of a
late January thaw. A few days after
the examination in a required
course, an undergraduate, of ihe
very best traditions and previous
training, asked me whether I had
noticed that nearly all of the stu
dents had come in rubber boots. The
reason- they wore boots, he ex
plained, was a simple one. They had
copied important formulae, prob
lems, and other necessary material
upon the inside of their boots,
which, in the warmth of the room,
could be turned down to the neces
sary place without suspicion.
He insisted that at least 80 per
cent of his classmates had indulged
in the practice, and as the majority
were doing it, he assured me that
the practice, having become student
custom, aroused no resentment.
Whether or not there may have
been some exaggeration in this ac
count, alumni of any number of in
stitutions, many of them of other
wise high standing, will tell you
that in their time, in connection
with certain examinations, some
what similar conditions prevailed.
Pledge Employed
The most frequent means em
ployed to make explicit the obliga
tion not to cheat in examinations is
some form of pledge. At Princeton
the system requires that every stu
dent sign" upon his examination
paper: "I pledge my honor as a gen
tleman that during this examina
tion I have neither given nor re
ceived assistance."
Where such a system is in opera
tion, in practice the most serious
difficulty is to persuade the under
graduates to observe this obligation
which the system itself imposes. In
case an undergraduate in the course
of an examination observes another
student violating his pledge, he is
bound to report him to the under
graduate committee in charge. This
difficulty must be faced squarely.
Where undergraduates are unwilling
to do this, and where from the un
dergraduates' standpoint no stigma
is attached to the violation of the
pledge, an honor system, however
desirable in the abstract, is, in the
opinion of many critics, impossible.
Cheating Game
Only too many undergraduates
feel that to outwit the professor or
proctors is the same kind of game
that is played when the sophomore
steals the sign by outwitting the
policeman. The professor and the
proctor do not belong to the under
graduates' crowd.
Successful honor systems, enlist
ing the support of this gang moral
ity, utilize it to prevent such cheat
ing. For this reason, it is impossible
for any faculty to impose an honor
system from above. It can only be
successful where it has the whole
hearted undergraduate support, and
it is is probably for this reason that
the honor systems which have been
most successful through a long
series of years are those which have
been started by undergraduates
themselves in colleges like the Uni
versity of Virginia and Princeton,

where the sense of campus solidarity
has been strong.
Student Task

The psychology of undergraduates
being what it is, it is futile, as I
see it, to expect an honor system
to receive the necessary support
from the students unless the whole
question of honesty in examinations
is turned over to them, lock, stock,
and barrel, without any reservations
whatever by the faculty. Unless a
faculty is prepared to do this with
the fullest confidence, they should
not attempt to persuade undergradu
ates to take part in an honor sys
tem; and unless the undergraduates
are willing to accept the very heavy
responsibilities involved, they should
not request to be relieved of what
they call the indignities of the proc
toring system.
It is, of course, disagreeable to
have to report a fellow-student. Un
dergraduates cannot be expected to
report him to an alien group like
the faculty. They must, however,
report him to his equals, and their
predicament here is much the same
as that of members of a club who
realize that one of their fellows has
been guilty of conduct that seriously
reflects upon the honor and good
name of their club.
Penalties Severe
The penalty where a student is
guilty must be severe. Cheating in
examinations becomes for an under
graduate quite as serious a matter
as cheating at cards for a member
of a club. Both cheaters, if de
tected, are dishonorably dismissed
and a stigma is attached to both.
That, at least, is involved in the
honor system as it exists at Prince
ton. It was established there 37
years ago just because a large body
of the undergraduates became so
thoroughly disgusted with the
amount of cheating that was then
taking place that they requested
permission of the faculty to take
charge of the whole matter. That
permission was granted. The under
graduate committee which was then
set up, and which includes the presi
dents of the four classes and three
other members, has had complete
jurisdiction of honesty in examina
tions ever since; and they have dis
charged their trust so successfully
that the honor system has become
the most highly cherished of all the
traditions of the college.
I believe that my opinion will be
shared by all my colleagues at

Princeton when I add that no col
lege tradition or custom that I know
of has a more favorable effect upon
general undergraduate morale than
a successful honor system.
(Princeton University has tried
the honor system for 37 years, and
found it an outstanding success. In
the following article, condensed
from the New York Times, the dean
of the college there discusses the
system and and the undergraduate
ethics it involves.—Editor.)

Honor systems vary so widely
among themselves that it is difficult
to make any one definition which
will include them all. For the pur
pose of focusing discussion, in spite
of the risks involved, I am, how
ever, rash enough to propose the
following system: An honor system
is a system conducted by under
graduates which makes explicit the
obligation of the student not to re
sort to dishonesty and provides the
agencies to try the cases of violators
and impose the necessary penalties.
The range of activities covered by
the system may be more or less ex
tensive, but every honor system in
variably covers dishonesty in ex
aminations.
