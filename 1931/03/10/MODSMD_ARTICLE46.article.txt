# VIENNA PROFESSOR THRILLS AUDIENCE
## Sewing Thimble Has Enough Energy To Blow Up World MINUTE ATOMS AND UNIVERSE COMPARED 
### 
Visions of awe-inspiring and in
comprehensible minuteness were
glimpsed by a hushed audience in
the Little Theatre yesterday after
noon when an apple-cheeked little
man with a gentleness in his manner
and a sibilant hiss in his speech
spoke on "Atoms and the Universe."
Reading from a prepared manu
script and pronouncing words like
"physicist" as "feezeessisst," Dr. Ar
thur Haas, professor of physics at
the University of Vienna, who came
to Stanford under the auspices of
the local chapter of Sigma Xi, never
theless held his audience by un
folding astounding facts and figures
that scientists have unearthed in
pushing back the boundaries of the
earth.
Graphically Haas stated that an
innocent looking thing like a ladies'
sewing thimble contained more
atoms than there ever had been
people on this earth, with enough
energy in them to blow up the
earth.
Since the age of the dinousars the

radius of the universe has been en
larged some ten per cent, and has
doubled itself cnce in the last four
teen million years, according to a
recent theory, while the earth is
like a straw in a huge bonfire com
pared to the sun. And the spiral
nebulae a trillion trillion times, and
you have the probable size of the
universe.

The universe is disintergrating
with the gradual dissolution of mat
ter, with no way out. But the gen
erations of men millions of years
hence, not the present generation,
will have to worry about that.
A light ray would take some
eight minutes to travel to the sun
and 300,000,000 light years to get to
the spiral nebulae way out in the
universe .... And so it went as
Professor Haas developed the idea
of the dimensions of the world of
atoms and the universe as com
pared with the dimensions of the
world of human beings, v/ith man
pushed into a back seat before the
forces and grandeur of nature.
