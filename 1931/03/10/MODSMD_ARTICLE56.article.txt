Though the sports staff of the
Daily is through for the quarter,
though students will knock off for
a week after the approaching an
nual grind, athletes representing this
institution in intercollegiate track
and baseball will be far from inac
tive during the vacation. Especially
strenuous is the program scheduled
for Harry Wolter's ball club, which
goes on the road immediately after
finals, journeying in a southerly di
rection. The showing of the Indians
in the quartet of games at Los An
geles, two each with the Bruins and
the Trojans, will be the real test.

If the local nine can win three
out of the four, horsehide fans
will be free to rejoice.. The way
the Redshirts have cleaned up
in their first six starts has put
baseball enthusiasts in sort of
of a daze. They don't know
whether they are dreaming or
whether Wolter's men are just
naturally hot. Let us hope that
it is neither,- but that Stanford
at last has a real ball club. When
the team returns, we shall know.

Though the whole nine played
good ball in that last St. Mary's
game Saturday, the sterling ability
of two players apparently meant the
difference between just another dia
mond outfit and a championship ag
gregation. We refer to Dan Johnson
and Rudy Rintala. Dan came up
from last year's freshman squad
hailed as one of the best pitchers
ever to enter Stanford, and his per
formances so far seem to bear out
the prediction. Rudy clouted a
homer and a three-bagger to con
tinue the excellent start of what
may prove his best season with the
big hickory stick.

While the ball team is down
South during the vacation, Dink
Templeton's track stars will be
at Seattle for an indoor meet
with the University of Washing
ton. This should be something
of a lunch for Dink's athletes,
but it is only the forerunner of
a good-sized dinner which is
coming up on April 4 against
the L.A.A.C. cindermen. From
the showing of this aggregation
in the S.P.A.A.U. meet last Sat
urday against the Trojans and
a host of others, right now it
looks as though this might prove
too big a meal for the Indians
to digest.

However, when the subject of
track is brought up in any sports
gossip, strangely enough the meet
with the southern clubmen is smoth
ered under a shower of predictions
and counter-predictions concerning
a certain dual affair on tap in the
Stadium May 2. ''Down with Troy
and Dean Cromwell" becomes the
watchword. Though it is pretty
early in the year to have much of
a line on the potentialities of the
1831 Trojan team, its strength on
paper is no secret. The results of
the Southern Pacific A.A.U. meet
show S.C. possibilities in an event
or two, although most of the compe
tition was in relays anywhere from
440 yards to ten miles.
<£'<?> <$»
Stev/art of U.S.C. won the high
jump with a leap of 6 ft. 2 in., while
his teammate, Barber, was taking
the broad jump at 24 ft. 6% in.
Those, friends and countrymen, are
what most persons would call ex
cellent early-season marks. We
would call them just excellent
marks, for they would be worth
plenty even in I.C.4-A. competition,
which provides the very latest rec
ords of the year. Bob Hall's throw
of 147 ft. 114 in. causes no worry
on the Farm as long as Bob Jones
is tossing the platter out more than
10 feet beyond that mark. The Tro
jan spear-tossers also failed to show
much, while the shot-putting of the
meet was nothing to shout about.
'<$> ❖ <♦>
No regulation distances were
run in the S.P. meet, so the Red
and Gold miler and two-milers
were concerned chiefly with
lengthy relays. However, it is a
well-known fact that at present
the Troy distance runners could
take copious points from Tem
pleton's men. Paul Aebersold's
8:53.8 in the eight-lap event
Saturday may be an indication
of a change in this situation be
fore May 2. Now let Bob Brown
lower his time about five sec
onds in the mile, and the vul
nerable spot in Dink's up and
coming young track team will
be just about remedied.
