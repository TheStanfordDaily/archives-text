# Eighteen Will Travel South With Varsity Nine
## LIST NOT MADE UP AS INDIANS CLOSE WINTER PRACTICE! Two Games With U.S.C. ...And Two With U.C.L.A. On Card Schedule 
### Francis Lloyd 
Eighteen men will be taken South
on the annual invasion of the Stan
ford baseball squad which takes
place during the spring holidays. No
definite list has beei^,announced by
Coach Harry Wolter of the men who
are to make the trip, as there are
still two weeks of practice remain
ing before the exodus from the
Farm begins.
It seems probable that the nine
men who played last Saturday
against the Gaels will make the trip.
They are: Dan Johnson, Miller,
Hardy, Philippi, Dykes Johnson,
Delmas, Hunken, Rintala, and
Campbell. As second string pitcher,
Frank Milsap seems to be the most
likely candidate.
Which men will fill out the rest
of the roster leaving for the south
land after finals is uncertain, al
though it seems likely that Wolter
will take along two or three more
pitchers and one or two more back
stops. Added to these there should
be at least one utility infielder and
one utility outfielder.
New Uniforms Appear
Yesterday's practice was featured
by the annual appearance, about this
time of the year, of the new uni
forms. Philippi, however, refused
to cast off his old blue sweatshirt
that distinguishes him from his
white-clad teammates.
Riede, a man Wolter tried out in
the outfield at the first of the year,
was doing the throwing in yester
day's session and appears to be a
| belated mid-season find.
There were several performances
I during the progress of the massacre
of the hardy Gaels last Saturday,
other than the hitting, on the part
of the Indians, that brought joy to
the followers of the national sport
on the Farm.
Campbell Shines
A long, accurate peg from Camp
bell in right field, clipping off Regus
at third base in the second inning,
was the most outstanding individual
| play of the game. It is still a moot
question who was the most surprised
by .the throw—Regus, the fans,
Harry Wolter, or—Gordy Campbell.
The general handling of the ball
by the Indian infield was the best
seen on the Farm this season. Al
though the Cards did not play error
less ball, they gave every indication
of becoming one of the smoothest
working outfits in the conference.
Trojans First
Starting off with two, games with
the Trojans, on March 24 and 25,
Wolter's men will be faced by the
team they must defeat in order to
have any chance fot - conference hon
ors. Py taking one game from Sam
Barry's men, the Indians would be
in a fair position foir grabbing the
title.
The two games with the Bruins
should not cause the Stanford nine
a great deal of trouble. Hitting as
they are now there seems little pos
sibility that the Cards could be
stopped by any of the pitchers on the
Southern Branch's squad.

place during the spring holidays. No
definite list has beei^,announced by
Coach Harry Wolter of the men who
are to make the trip, as there are
still two weeks of practice remain
ing before the exodus from the
Farm begins.
It seems probable that the nine
men who played last Saturday
against the Gaels will make the trip.
They are: Dan Johnson, Miller,
Hardy, Philippi, Dykes Johnson,
Delmas, Hunken, Rintala, and
Campbell. As second string pitcher,
Frank Milsap seems to be the most
likely candidate.
Which men will fill out the rest
of the roster leaving for the south
land after finals is uncertain, al
though it seems likely that Wolter
will take along two or three more
pitchers and one or two more back
stops. Added to these there should
be at least one utility infielder and
one utility outfielder.
New Uniforms Appear
Yesterday's practice was featured
by the annual appearance, about this
time of the year, of the new uni
forms. Philippi, however, refused
to cast off his old blue sweatshirt
that distinguishes him from his
white-clad teammates.
Riede, a man Wolter tried out in
the outfield at the first of the year,
was doing the throwing in yester
day's session and appears to be a
| belated mid-season find.
There were several performances
I during the progress of the massacre
of the hardy Gaels last Saturday,
other than the hitting, on the part
of the Indians, that brought joy to
the followers of the national sport
on the Farm.
Campbell Shines
A long, accurate peg from Camp
bell in right field, clipping off Regus
at third base in the second inning,
was the most outstanding individual
| play of the game. It is still a moot
question who was the most surprised
by .the throw—Regus, the fans,
Harry Wolter, or—Gordy Campbell.
The general handling of the ball
by the Indian infield was the best
seen on the Farm this season. Al
though the Cards did not play error
less ball, they gave every indication
of becoming one of the smoothest
working outfits in the conference.
Trojans First
Starting off with two, games with
the Trojans, on March 24 and 25,
Wolter's men will be faced by the
team they must defeat in order to
have any chance fot - conference hon
ors. Py taking one game from Sam
Barry's men, the Indians would be
in a fair position foir grabbing the
title.
The two games with the Bruins
should not cause the Stanford nine
a great deal of trouble. Hitting as
they are now there seems little pos
sibility that the Cards could be
stopped by any of the pitchers on the
Southern Branch's squad.
Eighteen men will be taken South
on the annual invasion of the Stan
ford baseball squad which takes
place during the spring holidays. No
