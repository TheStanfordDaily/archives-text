# SENIORS, SOPHS TIE 0-0 IN LAST GAME OF HOCKEY SEASON
## 
### 
Resulting in a triple tie between
the seniors, juniors, and sophomores
for the W.A.A. championship, the
seniors and sophomores battled to a
0-0 tie in a fast, hard-fought game
yesterday afternoon. There will be
no playoff, because of W.A.A. rul
ings.
Yesterday's game was played all
over the field with a great deal of
bunching done by ]poth sides. Each
goal was threatened on several oc
casions, but accurate shots made by
the backfield and goal-keepers pre
vented any score.
Excellent competition was pro
vided with Ruth Fisher, center half
back and sophomore captain, play
ing opposite Edith Badger, stellar
forward on the senior team. Fast
running, clever stickwork, and con
stant vigilance on the part of the
former prevented Edith Badger's
dribbles and passes from resulting
in a score, although there were sev
eral threats.
