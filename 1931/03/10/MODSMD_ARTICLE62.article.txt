# OUTCOME OF INDIAN TENNIS MATCHES WITH SOUTH OPTIMISTIC, SAYS EASTON
## 
### 
i To open what should prove to be
i a highly successful season, the var
j sity tennis team will travel south
! ward during spring vacation and
I take on their toughest opponent.
! The Cards will start right in on
I U.C.L.A. March 26, and meet U.S.C. i
| the following day.
j Captain Ted Easton expressed
â–  confidence in the outcome, largely
due, he says, to the fact that the six
Indian netmen are so nearly equal
in ability, whereas a team of widely
varied players presents a far weaker
front. *
Stanford's representatives will be
Keith Gledhill, Captain Ted Easton,
Harry Plymire, Joe Coughlin, Trow
Stephens, and Phil Niederauer, with
i probably Chuck Weesner and Bob
\ Forbes as alternatives. They will

! probably pair up Gledhill with Eas
ton, Coughlin and Plymire, and
Weesner-Forbes, for the two-man
event:
This six-man system, an innova
tion with this year's conference play,
provides for six singles and three
i doubles matches to comprise a meet,
i Elbert Lewis, Gledhill's. most
formidable opponent on the coast,
will have to be dealt with this first
encounter, as well as Cliff Robbins
and Leonard Dworkin. Lewis and
Dworkin, paired for the Bruins, will
be no easy pickings for the Gled
hill-Easton or Plymire-Cdughlin
combination, as the case mjpy be.
Another hard rock to crush will be
Jack De Lara of the Trojans, but
Gledhill is nevertheless favored to
sweep through any opposition of
fered him.
