# Indians Favored for Husky Track
## 440, Shot, Pole Vault, Discus, Javelin Probable Wins; Small Track Unfavorable to Redshirt Runners 
### Fritz Goodwin 
What looks like a top-heavy Ind
ian victory is due to occur in Seat
tle on March 28, when Coach Dink
Templeton's varsity trackmen take
on the Washington Huskies in an
indoor meet. The Stanford runners
may be bothered a little by the
smaller track, but all indications
point to a repetition of last year's
sweeping Cardinal success.
Scant news of startling early sea
son performances has drifted south
ward from the lair of the Husky.
With the three big stars of last
season's aggregation, Kiser, Ander
son, and Jessup, no longer in collegi
ate competition, the Washington
team is weaker on paper than it
has been for some time.
Wins Assured
Clean sweeps seem assured for
Stanford in the 440, shot put, discus,
and pole vault. Ben 'Eastman, Ike
; Hables, and Maynor Shove will have
I to run a two-turn quarter, but they
i should have little difficulty in crash-

ing the winning column in that or
der.
Indoor conditions should have no
detrimental effect on the Stanford
weight men, and Bob Jones, Nellie
Gray, Here Laborde, George
and Norm McLeod will surely add
points to the Indian total.
Cardinal track fans are wont to
consider the pole vault a weak spof
in the 1931 team, but Deacon, De-
Groot, and Johns are all capable
of at least 12 feet 6 inches, whereas
the Husky varsity vaulters failed to
clear 11 feet 6 in a recent practice
meet. <
Speed Superior
Hec Dyer and Frank
: will be favored to cop the century
! from Frisby, Bledsoe, and Pendleton,' 1
! Husky 10 jsecond men. The fur-i
j long will include one turn, but the.
■ superior speed of the Indian sprint
ers should keep them out in front 1
in spite of the unusual handicap.
Captain Podge Smith and A1 Nis-i
bet have both been clocked in times,
vastly better than those of the Se
attle hurdlers. With a shortened
distance in the low barrier event,
Nisbet may furnish a thrill in beat-,
ing out the Indian captain for first
place.
Nothing is known of the
of the Husky squad in the highd
jump and broad jump, but ArnieJ
West, Don Blackman, Wally Butler,
Bill Werder, Dan Woodyatt, and' l
Paul Zaches can jump right along<
with most Pacific Coast collegians. ,
Javelin Good
As for the javelin, Al Ray and'
Fred Zuger are both capable oh
190 feet in ordinary competition, and
by March 28 these two Indian spear
tossers may give Seattle fans quite 1
a thrill when they heave with the'
t Huskies. j
Ray was "hot" yesterday after-,
noon at practice, his best effort sail
ing out to the 200 foot 3 inch mark.'
He had three other throws during ]
the session of 199, 198, and 198 feet,
to his credit. He was stepping over I
the line a little, but his performance 1
promises great things for the field!

What looks like a top-heavy Ind
ian victory is due to occur in Seat
tle on March 28, when Coach Dink
Templeton's varsity trackmen take
on the Washington Huskies in an
indoor meet. The Stanford runners
may be bothered a little by the
smaller track, but all indications
point to a repetition of last year's
sweeping Cardinal success.
Scant news of startling early sea
son performances has drifted south
ward from the lair of the Husky.
With the three big stars of last
season's aggregation, Kiser, Ander
son, and Jessup, no longer in collegi
ate competition, the Washington
team is weaker on paper than it
has been for some time.
Wins Assured
Clean sweeps seem assured for
Stanford in the 440, shot put, discus,
and pole vault. Ben 'Eastman, Ike
; Hables, and Maynor Shove will have
I to run a two-turn quarter, but they
i should have little difficulty in crash-

ing the winning column in that or
der.
Indoor conditions should have no
detrimental effect on the Stanford
weight men, and Bob Jones, Nellie
Gray, Here Laborde, George
and Norm McLeod will surely add
points to the Indian total.
Cardinal track fans are wont to
consider the pole vault a weak spof
in the 1931 team, but Deacon, De-
Groot, and Johns are all capable
of at least 12 feet 6 inches, whereas
the Husky varsity vaulters failed to
clear 11 feet 6 in a recent practice
meet. <

j long will include one turn, but the.
■ superior speed of the Indian sprint
ers should keep them out in front 1

Captain Podge Smith and A1 Nis-i
bet have both been clocked in times,
vastly better than those of the Se
attle hurdlers. With a shortened
distance in the low barrier event,
