# Coast Spring Grid Practice Starts
## INGRAM EXPECTED! 10 INFUSE BEARS WITH NEW SPIRIT Allison And Wickhorst Will Arrive By End Of Week To Complete Staff 
### 
Spring football practice will soon
be in full sway on the Pacific Coast.
What is expected to be a new era
in grid affairs at the University of
California opens this week at Berke
ley, with William "Navy Bill" In
gram taking over the reins dropped
last fall by Clarence "Nibs" Price.
Ingram's two assistants, Stub Al
lison and Frank Wickhorst, have not
yet reported, but are expected to
be on deck by the end of the week.
Fundamentals will be the rule this
spring, according to Ingram, who
holds that an instinctive knowledge
of blocking and tackling Js an abso
lute necessity to a winning grid
team.
Just what system of offense the
new Bear mentor will empoly is
still a question. While he used a
modified Warner attack at Anna
polis, Ingram is expected to drop the
double wingback formation em
ployed by Warner and present a
still further modified system.
Meanwhile practice started yes
terday at Southern California, with
a great many of last season's stars
turning out. Included in the roster
of returning Trojans are Pinckert,
Musick, Mohler, Shaver, Arbelbede,
Flail, and others who contributed to
that dismal day last fall.
While informal workouts have
been held throughout the winter,
spring practice will get under way
at Stanford in earnest the week fol
lowing vacation.
Besides the conventional work 6n
fundamentals, Warner is expected
to devote much of the time to ex
perimentation.
The spring workouts will mark
the start of his search for a fullback
to replace Rothqrt and Simpkins,
both of whom .have left the fold.
There seems to be plenty of good
material for backfield post ex
cept fullback, with Hillman return
ing at quarter, Moffatt, Caddel, Rin
tala, and possibly Caglieri at half,
and Wilson, Baker, Allen, and others
available as reserves.
While Caglieri announced some
time ago that he would not return
next fall, there is still a possibility
that he will alter his decision.
