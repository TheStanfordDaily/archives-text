# SMALL 'GOLD RUSH' SEEN BY GEOLOGISTS
## 
### 
A miniature "gold rush" above St.
Francis Dam on San Francisquito
Creek, near Saugus, was viewed Sun
day morning by a party of Stan
ford geology professors on its way j
home from a two-day convention i
in Pasadena.
What was at first thought to be ;
a biological survey group turned out |
to be unemployed persons, many of j
them well-dressed, who were pan- j
ning and cradling for gold. Rumors i
are current that the "miners" make i
$8 a day. i
Professors Eliot Blackwelder, A. j
F. Rogers, and H. D. Schenck, and ;
Aaron Water, instructor in geology, j
read papers at the convention, which
was a joint regional meeting of J
Geological Society of America, Pa- i
leontological Society of America, j
and Branner Geological Club and !
was held at the California Institute i
of Technology.
