Armed with photographs of their
"husbands," eleven Japanese picture
brides arrived here today on the
N.Y.K. liner Ginyo Maru en route to
Callao, Peru, where there is a Japa
nese colony.

Under Japanese law a male Japa
nese in a remote colony may send a
picture of himself back to Japan. Af
ter the girls who want husbands scan
the picture the one who who de
cided to marry the colonist accepts
transportation from him and starts
for her new home. When she ar
rives she picks out her man and
marries him.
