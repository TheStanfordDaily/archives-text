# Stars Slated To Repeat Win In Coast Loop
## Manager Of Seals Expects To Make Strong Bid For P.C.L. Title 
### Lowell Cox 
When the Pacific Coast League
baseball season gets under way next
month, the Hollywood Stars will be
generally regarded as the club to
beat out for the pennant.
After coming from far behind to
j spurt into second place in the first
| half last season, the Stars kept up
i the pace to cop the second section
| of the split schedule and win the
j play-off series from the Angels.
There is little reason to believe
that Hollywood will not again pre
sent a powerful team this year, but
there are those who expect to have
something to say about the matter.
Seals Contender
Nick Williams, genial pilot of the
San Francisco Seals, tells the writ
ers that he expects the Seals to give
| them all a race, with the Los
j Angeles club another strong con
i tender.
j "It's too early, however," Williams
j said at the Monterey camp last
| week-end, "to tell definitely how
j things will shape up. Portland and
j Sacramento may surprise us, and
j some of the other clubs may come
along to upset things."
In this connection it will be re
membered that Sacramento dumped
the dope cart last season by sticking
at the top until near the close of the
first half, when they suddenly col
lapsed. The Oakland Oaks also
proved an unexpected stumbling
block:
Depending" On Pitchers
Williams is again banking on his
pitching staff to keep the Seals in
the race. With a list of class A A
| hurlers headed by Jimmy Zinn, the
.j Seals would appear to be sitting
j pretty. At this time last year, how
| ever, the staff looked just as good,
! but fell down when the campaign
| opened.
But barring the unexpected, the
i hurlers should deliver. The list in
; eludes beside Zinn, who won 28
games last year, Sam Gibson, Bill
Henderson, Art Delaney, Elmer
I Jacobs, Art McDougal, Hal Turpin,
| "Lefty" Douglas, Phil Mulcahy, Cur
| tis Davis, and Clyde Perry,
j The Seals will break camp at
j Monterey tomorrow night and will
| work out at their new plant in San
! Francisco Thursday. On Friday
| they will inaugurate the park with
i an exhibition game with Detroit.

Coach Glendon of Columbia says
I that rowing is on the wane.
