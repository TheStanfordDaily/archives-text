# NEW BALL PLAYERS BRIGHTEN OUTLOOK FOR FROSH SQUAD
## Maentz, Panero, Massey New Additions To Babe Lineup 
### 
Fresh blood injected into the line
up by Coach Murray Cuddeback has
put the freshmen diamond men into
a winning stride. After a mediocre
start that was brightened only by
Stan Anderson's masterful hurling,
the infield has gained steadiness and
the team as a whole has improved
in hitting power. As a result the
babes took the honors in their last
three starts.
Next on the schedule of games is a
clash with Burlingame High School
on Wednesday, and after that ap
pears the name of the California
freshmen on April 4. Other games
may be scheduled to complete the
blank dates.
Maentz at short and Pinero in
right field are two new men who
have improved the team materially,
while Massey has showed up well
behind the plate.
Outstanding is the record of Stan
Anderson this season. With close
to an average of two strikeouts per
inning pitched, this big right hander
has stamped himself as great ma
terial for next year's varsity.
