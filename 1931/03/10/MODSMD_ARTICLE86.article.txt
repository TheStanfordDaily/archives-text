# LOCAL RADIO CLUB SENDS MESSAGES TO DISTANT LANDS
## International Wireless Code Employed To Relate Campus Gossip 
### 
Into a narrow wireless room in
the Electrical Engineering building,
picturesquely cluttered like the
traditional news office, littered
cigarettes on the floor, radio station
cards covering the wall—delicate
flashing bulbs—copper wire—comes
the staccato whisper of continental
Morse code.
Here conversations are carried on
daily with all far-flung posts of the
world, through the short wave 75
watt transmitter, and four tube re
ceiver of the Stanford radio club.
Foreign Messages
The log-book shows conversations
recorded with New Zealand, Mexico
City, Australia, Japan, the U.S.
Marine Corps in Guam, and station
in Manila and Shanghai.
Radio instruments built last year
by the 16 members of the club are
bringing most successful connections,
though static interference will be
gin with late spring, according to
Robert Geddes, president of the club.
International Code
A surprising majority of the far
away amateur operators send dots
and dashes translatable into English,
according to the Stanford operators.
When the language happens to be
beyond the linguistic capacities of
all the club members, an interna
tional code language is resorted to,
in order to exchange campus scandal
for tidings of the weather in Osaka
or latest gossip from a merchant ship
at sea.
Send Radiograms
Radiograms are sent by the club,
without charge, to any part of the
world, through relay services passed
on from amateur stations.
Experience gained through tinker
ing with the Stanford instruments
stands club members in good stead.
Geddes has been over the world as
wireless operator on six vessels, ply
ing their separate routes around the
countries of the earth. The job com
bines officer's privileges, the best
of sight-seeing, with a significant
duty, according to Geddes.
