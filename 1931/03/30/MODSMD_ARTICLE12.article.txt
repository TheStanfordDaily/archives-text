### 
WASHINGTON, March 29. (&)—
Smoothing his way toward a second
term is President Hoover's task on
his return today from his Porto
Rican trip. There is an organized
movement in the South headed
by Colonel Horace Mann, former
Hoover partisan, to block the Presi
dent's return to the executive chair.
Hoover adherents claim that in
spite of Calvin Coolidge's "I do not
choose to run," he is a menace to
the incumbent's chances of re-elec
tion.
The President, however, has eight
months of quiet, working with his
lieutenants to insure his renomina
tion before campaign fireworks
start.
