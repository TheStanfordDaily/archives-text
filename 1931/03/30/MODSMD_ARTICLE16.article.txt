# BLOOD STAINS MAY HELP FIND CRIMINAL
## 
### 
BERLIN, March 29. (JP)—Classi- j
fication of bloodstains is being made |
by a German expert as an aid in i
crime detection. •
He believes that eventually the !
stains on the clothing of a suspect !
may be classified so that it quickly
will be matched with that of the I
victim.
While courts have recognized sci- |
entitle tests to determine whether
bloodstains were made by human [
blood or not, there has been no test
which will accurately determine the ;
blood group of stains which have J
been thoroughly dried. The expert j
believes he will supply this defi
ciency.
