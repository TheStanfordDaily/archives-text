# Swain Acknowledges Wilbur's Council In Presidential Report
## Advance in "Graduate University" Movement Indicated; Dean Culver Sees New Scholastic Attitude; Says Student Conduct Improved 
### 
ALTHOUGH he was given full responsibility for the conduct of Uni
versity affairs, Acting-President Robert Eckles Swain indicates in his
annual report issued recently that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur has offered his
counsel and assistance on matters of policy during the last year, when iiis
attention has been chiefly taken up with the duties of the Secretary of
the Interior, and that this offer was -4 fll times gratefully received.

"I have had the privilege during ibis period of his absence from the
University of seeking his counsel on important matters of University
policy at any time and have received from him promptly and freely the

* benefits of his helpful sAggestion,"
' the acting president says of Wilbur
! in his report.
Graduates Increase
That the movement toward mak
ing Stanford merely a graduate uni
versity is gaining headway was also
I indicated in the President's report.
I According to the report 1,530 stu
dents were enrolled for graduate
! work, representing almost one-third
! of the total registration. The total
! registration for the past year was
j -1,642, representing a decrease of 35
! from the registration for the aca
demic year 1928-29.
The Dean of Men in his section
j of the report calls attention to the
i fact that there is a "greatly changed
: attitude among men students in
j general, regarding scholarship hon
! ors." Culver says that the traditional
; aversion toward "Phi Betes" is giv
ing way to an interest in scholarship
! that is "sound and full of encour-
I agement for the future of our gradu
j ates." He attributes this change to
j scholastic honors won by men
j prominent in campus affairs, par
ticularly varsity athletes.
Conduct Unusually Good
"Student conduct, has been un
usually satisfactory during the year,"
according to the Dean of Men. There
were only 15 cases, involving 19
men, handled by the Men's Council,
j as compared with 31 cases, involving
;51 men, for the preceding year. The
| number of men dismissed for rea
| sons other than scholastic was seven
last year, against 13 the year before.
Dean Culver reports that the fra
ternity situation was much improved
: and "in sharp contrast to the fiasco
|of the preceding year. Fraternity
membership is decidedly more
1 democratic and can no longer justly
be called a body of sons of the rich,"
j was the Dean's opinion.
Women's Rushing Scored
Dr. Dyment, medical adviser of
J women, in her section of the re
j port, stated that "the greatest single
j factor which affected the health of
j a large group of women in the win
| tcr quarter was the rushing season."
The report stated that the day
I following "bidding" over sixty wo
| men appeared at the office for medi
cal care. "The excitement, the hys-
I teria, the nerve tension, the fatigue,
the complete breakdown and de
j pression which followed in some
j cases was appalling, and it is with
j profound dismay that we contem
-1 plate the return of the rushing sca-
I son," Dr. Dyment stated.
