# Lagunita Water Sports Are Doomed This Spring
## 
### 
Lagunita, spring quarter play
| ground for generations of Stanford
students, probably will never be
1 full enough for water sports this
j year, according to J. W. McDonnell,
| assistant superintendent of grounds
I and buildings.
The lake is now almost com
pletely dry, though in previous
years it has almost been at the
! high-water level by this time of
year. The entire campus may have
to make some water economies if
[ the rest of the rainy season does not
raise the eight-inch total reported
so far.
i McDonnell, however, sees no
I cause for alarm, for the campus is
provided with a surplus of stored
j water from last year and has four
! wells. The University used <100,000,-

l 000 gallons of water last year, it is
| estimated, and at the present time
j there are only 157,000,000 gallons
! stored in the two reservoirs, Sears- !
ville Lake and Felt Lake.
Searsville this year is 10.47 feet 1
below its usual level foi 1 the end of 1
! March, while Felt Lake is 29 feet
! below the high-water mark. Lagu
nity is empty because practically no '
I water has flowed down San Fran
cisquito creek as far even as the
junction with the Lagunita diver
sion ditch.
It. is estimated that the golf i
course, the heaviest individual con
sumer of water, will need only 40,-
000,000 gallons this year to keep it
in good condition. An extra 100,- j
000,000 gallons was required last
year to get the turf on its fairways .
. and greens firmly begun.
