### 
ALLAHABAD, India, March 29.
OP) â€”While rioting spread across
the Ganges from Cawnpore, where
! furious battles involving thousands
j raged between villages on opposite
sides of the river, the Indian Nation
! al Congress, meeting at Karachi to
i day, openly demanded immediate
[ unqualified independence for India.

At Cawnpore many bodies of vic
tims were said to have been thrown
into the river Ganges. The total
death roll in recent disturbances is
now officially estimated at 200.
Sixty thousand delegates to the
National Congress tendered Mahat
ma Gandhi a huge demonstration
immediately after the meeting was
called to order. Women filed before
him, kissing his feet, and thousands
pressed forward to Mahatma as
though drawn toward Ihe light of
their new-found freedom. There
was not a single policeman in the
crowd.
When Valladai Patel, presiding at
Ihe National Congress, declared that
America was in warm sympathy
with the struggle for independence,
he was interrupted by a storm of
cheers by the numerous Americans
present.
