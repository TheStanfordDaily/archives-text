CAN MATEO, March 2(1. — A
bath towel is not warm
enough clothing for a co-ed

March, thinks Dean Robert J.

College. Even indoors on the
stage it's not enough.
Dean Hopkins criticized a
scene in the student press club
follies, in which Miss Virginia
Hole, clad only in a towel, ap
peared with Graham Kisling
bury. The scene had previously
been approved by a faculty

wore a "regulation" chorus girl
costume under the towel.
The dean's criticism was in a
letter to the student executive
committee.
