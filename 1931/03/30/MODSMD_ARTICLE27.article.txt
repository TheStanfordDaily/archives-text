# ALUMNI 10 SEE WOMEN'S GYM
## Kaffee Klatsch To Be Held On University Day 
### 
When alumni return to Stanford
on University Day, April 18, they
will be greeted by a new women's
gymnasium, built in Spanish style,
which will harmonize with the rest
of the Quad buildings. On that day
the auxiliary committee of the wo
men's gymnasium committee is
sponsoring events which will both
display the building and help to
raise the $16,400 necessary for its
furnishing.

In the forenoon from 9 until 12
o'clock, there will be a kaffee
klatsch in the patio of the new
gymnasium, at which coffee cake,
coffee, and fruit will be sold for
50 cents. The Stanford Band will
play during this time. The alumni
will be received by faculty mem
bers and will be shown about the
building.
At the U.C.-Stanford track meet
in the afternoon and during the
baseball game which will follow,
concessions will be superintended
by the women students, under the
general management of the auxiliary
committee. There will be four main
booths for the candy, peanuts, ice
cream, and pop, and the Board of
Athletic Control has given special
permission to sell inside the Sta
dium, a permission which has not
been granted heretoforo.
The auxiliary committee, com
posed of representatives from the
various alumnae organizations, was
oi'ganized last quarter for the ex
press purpose of helping the wo
men's gymnasium committee to
raise money for furnishing the new
building.

Further plans for University Day
will be discussed at the meeting of
those in charge of the koffee klatsch
at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon in the
Women's Clubhouse.
