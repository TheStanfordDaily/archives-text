### 
WASHINGTON, March 29. (JP)â€”
Senator Wheeler, Democrat of Mon
i tana, today told reporters that he
i foresaw the formation of a new po-
I litical party if "reactionaries" gain
control of the Democratic and Re
publican parties.
Reasons that he gave for this pre
diction were the failure of business
leaders to alleviate the economic
congestion and the failure of execu
| tics to enforce anti-trust laws. He
j said that financial interests already
controlled the Republican party and
that the same interests may force
the Democrats to adopt a similar
; program.
