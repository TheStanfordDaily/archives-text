# FIFTEEN DEAD AFTER MOUNTAIN BLIZZARDS
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY, March 28 '/Pi.
Fresh snow fell (oday in the Rocky
Mountains in the wake of a spring
blizzard which took at least fifteen
lives there and in the prairie states.
Today's fall, however, was accom
panied by moderate temperatures
and while hampering re-establish
ment of communications with iso
lated communities where it is feared
more dead may be found, was not
expected to bring the tragedy of
last week's storm.
