An event unique in the history of Stanford will take
place this quarter. The new gymnasium, the product of 'XI
years' working and waiting on the pari of the women, will
be open at last, and perhaps more important to the Uni
versity at large will be presented by the Hoard of Ath
letic Control to the Hoard of Trustees.
In the past, the H.A.C. has built its offices, the Kncina
Gymnasium, and the Stadium, while all other buildings
have been erected by the I'niversilv. Hut now, the H.A.C.
lias constructed for the University a $235,000 building
which it will formally give to the trustees on tlie date of
its dedication, April 17.
When the women's gymnasium committee appealed lo
the H.A.C. last year, that body consented to either build
and furnish a smaller gymnasium or complete a larger
building, leaving it to the women to furnish it. The latter
offer was accepted.
Of the $20,(MM necessary for the furnishings, carnivals
last spring, summer, and fall, a drive last quarter, and
donations brought in -$.'s,Boo scarcely a fifth. Further
plans for raising the furnishing fund include a kaffee
klatsch at the gymnasium and concessions at the track
meet on University Day, April IK, both to be sponsored by
the auxiliary committee to the women's gymnasium com
mittee which will hold a puppet show, April 8, and a gym
nasium dance, April 2X. Proceeds from tonight's registra
tion dance will also be added to the fund.
The gymnasium thai now stands with open doors to the
women is a splendid building and a much appreciated gift.
Hut full benefit cannot be derived from it until students
and alumni help lo complete its furnishing.
