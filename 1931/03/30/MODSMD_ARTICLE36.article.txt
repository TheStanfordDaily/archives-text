# EXAMINATION'S ON FILE
## 
### 
University professors, human beings, have often been
privately eriticized by students who have felt that exami
nations were not written on a model plan. More recent is
the criticism that professors, having written good exami
nations, tend to ask the same questions, year after year.
At the University of Minnesota, students feel that repe
tition of questions is unfair to unorganized students, <ie- â€¢
daring in a recent petition that fraternity men can usually;
get copies of previous examinations from files kept from!
year to year. These students can, it is charged, pass exami-!
nations with a minimum of study, and receive unjustifiably j
high grades.
The petitioners ask that the university place on file in'
the library copies of all final examinations, giving students
not in organized groups the same opportunity which
Greeks enjoy. Over half the student body signed the Min
nesota petition in seven hours, and were promised action
bv Dean R. A. Stevenson.
The same problem exists at Stanford, where back
copies of examination questions are filed. However, few
examinations are repeated unchanged here. And some
Stanford professors make a practice of collecting all copies
of questions at fhe close of examinations.
The unique advantage of the Minnesota plan is that it
would afford all students the opportunity to learn what
features of their courses professors consider most impor
tant, would enable them lo organize more efficiently their
lecture notes, and would aid them in getting the most from |
their work.
