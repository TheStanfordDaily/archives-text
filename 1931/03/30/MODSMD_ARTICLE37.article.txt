The Editor, Sir:
At every American college there
j is a fashionable* pose for the student
j seeking something in the way of liv
' ing which suits the distinction of
being a college man to take, and at
| Stanford there is the pose of the
rough. So to the rough, things cul
i tural are superficialities, even the
word itself is something to use only
| in a mocking jest.
This pose is probably a hangover
from the' days when Stanford was
1 rough, when the West was still wild,
! and when the men came from the
| .soil. Fortunately, however, this spirit
i is losing ground, and the majority
j of students do not by any means
| take the rough pose. There is an
j element at Stanford that is strongly
j seeking a way to understand the
; finer developments in the cultural
parts of education, and it is this ele
-1 ment that will raise the standards
: and enhance the meaning of student
J life at Stanford.
Educated people in the community
| seem to realize the importance to
I the University of this student move
ment and hence to the Bay com
i munity; and it is they who really
j support the A.S.S.U. Concert Series.
| These people know and love good
music, and to them the student's
; "high-brow" music is the backbone
i of the concerts. Popular music might
I attract a few more students, but a
j series of negro spirituals and street
' marches would lose for the Concert
! Series its real supporters, and the
j whole thing would wind up before
j one season passed. Such a series, by
! the way, would make Stanford the
laughing stock of the musical world.
Musically speaking Tibbett is far
j out of the class of Robeson, and the
i Symphony is far out of the class of
! both of them. And as far as we can
judge all three are popular to about
i the same extent. In applause from
I the audience, Robeson undoubtedly
[ got the largest demonstrations ever

• HIGHBROW MUSIC ' IN A.S.S.C. CONCERTS

I given an artist in the Pavilion. The
' next greatest ovation given in the
1 pant four years by the students was
given to Dobrowen and the S.F.
! Symphony. Dobrowen's concert lor
the first time in at least four years
! made the students stamp their feet
| and shout.
J Whatever the student may v/ant
iin music, whether it be rhythm,
I melody, harmony, joy or sorrow,
I love or hate, he can find it expressed
in the "high-brow" music; and a
good artist always builds his pro
gram to cover all these points. An
| inexperienced person probably will
i not understand what it is all about
i at his first concert, but he will un
derstand more at his second, and
' in time he will learn to enjoy him
| self in a way that far surpasses any
j thing he has hitherto known. In this
way he learns how to really enjoy
| life—and what is education but the
study of life and learning how to
j make the most of it? It is the duty
|of the University to provide a
chance for everyone to become ac
quainted with good music just as
! much as any other subject of edu
cation. If the Concert Series could
not support itself, it would be good
to give it a budget taken out of
! student fees. The student's physical
, health is taken care of in the right
way; why not take care of his men
tal health in the right way?
It has been the ambition of the
Concert Series to get the most
1 popular of the first rate artists. Low
! ering the standard of artists would
not popularize the concerts. All art
ists play and sing about the same
things, and the most popular ones
; are the best. After all, there are
| few people of Robeson's type who
! are ever put on an artist series. We
must congratulate the A.S.S.U. Con
' cert Series for giving us popular
| concerts with such high standards
{ as they have boeen so successful in
i doing. —Bourne G. Eaton.
