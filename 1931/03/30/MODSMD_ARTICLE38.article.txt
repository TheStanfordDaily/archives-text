# Cabbages and Things

Bone jooer, or "How's your sun
burn? to all of you. Can't tell yet
how many of the old gang rave left
us for Ihree quarters of business
college or hog-calling, but you can
always count on a few heaven
blessed polishers to survive even
wiftter finals and come back for
more.
The aforesaid Heaven neglected
to send us a check at the end of
last quarter's rainbow, so we had
the unique privilege of hanging
around with the rest of the athletes
and Junior Opera authors, watching
'em make the wheels go round, dur
ing vacation.
For five hours, one morning last
week, Lagunita was at the point of
being saved from complete ignominy
by what seemed to be a junior
cloudburst. Guess it was only a
leaky pipe in the golf course sprink
ling system. We're still bone dry.
(Editor's note.)
You learn a lot of things, just
listening around this place,
though. There's the addition to
the famous Jewel songâ€”the
mating call of the amethyst,
"Oh pal, o-pal, o-pal!"
Another brilliant contempor
ary insists that a polygon is a
dead parrot. (Sure, you've heard

that before, hut who gives a
darn?) Anyhow, the 500 still
keep pets.
Along with the new green leaves
on the trees, and the sap running in
the maples (!) there's a decidedly
peculiar shade of new paint on the
Beta house . Take a look, with a
good strong pipe-full to bolster up
your nerve. Naturally, the brothers
had to do something to compele with
the Stucco-Zetes, in the rushing
season just ahead. It isn't every
house that can claim the next foot
ball captain as its very own . . , .
And speaking of that same
rushing season, just ask a cer
tain house on the right-hand
side of the Row what else the
famous tunnels under Encina
are used for, besides burrows
for inquisitive souls. Do we like
our societies to he secret, or no?
The women are all ready for
another siege of rushing, too,
we're told. Of course, a couple
of sororities only took sixteen or
seventeen pledges in January,
and need a chance to redeem
themselves.
While we've all been lazy, our
sweet sister Mills across the bay
has taken to wearing pajamas to
class. Is there something new, after
all? "In a co-ed it's her p.j.'s, in a
cigarette it's taste."
