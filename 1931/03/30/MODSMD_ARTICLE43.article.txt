A CONNECTICUT YANKEE. The
Stanford Theatre
Will Rogers or Mark Twain alone
are enough to make a hit of any
picture, but the combination of the
two is inevitably a howling success.
Mark Twain's immortal book has
been slightly diluted by the famous
Rogers humor, only the result ie
funnier rather than weaker. Twain
himself must have been thinking of
a Yankee like Will when he wrote.
The picture itself is very well
done. The . sets of the mythical
castles and the costumes are beau
tiful. The supporting cast, including
Myrna Loy and Maureen O'Sulli
van, is excellent. Only Frank Al
bertson is a little weak in his por
trayal of a dashing knight. —N. J.

BODY AND SOUL. At the Varsity
Quite a purple show. Elissa Lan
di, the new screen '"sensation," is
really lovely, and her talents are
fine enough to rise above the han
dicap of the weak vehicle afforded
by the picture as a whole. The star
is distinguished rather than beau
tiful, but she knows the art of ges
tures and attiiudes very perfectly.
The plot revolves around the ex
ploits of the American flying squad
ron in the war, with the mystery of
a sweetheart who is a spy melo
dramatically tangled up with a
thrilling raid on a German strong
hold.
Charles Farrell gives a splendid 1

performance as the hero — even
though the portrayal of a young,
man who knows nothing about
"women and sin" is apt to be an |
unsympathetic one.
The picture grows hysterically
involved toward the end, and the
final shots are unforgivably senti
mental. However it is fair enter- [
tainment.

EASY FOR ZEE ZEE—At the Green
Street Theatre, San Francisco.
Not exactly Victorian in either its
lines or action, "Easy for Zee Zee"
has been roundly condemned by one
San Francisco newspaper. However,
except perhaps to the over-sensitive,
it is amusingly ingenious.
Revived after an absence from the
stage following an extremely long
run, the play is well acted. It deals
with the problems of marriage, mis
tresses, and morals in the approved
fashion of French farces. While some
of the lines are frankly "raw" and
Zee Zee's costume is rather sketchy,
the thing is, all in all, not at all
offensive, but unusually amusing. A
congenial, informal atmosphere, to
gether with the unusually small size
of the midget theatre, seem of as
sistance in putting the play over.
