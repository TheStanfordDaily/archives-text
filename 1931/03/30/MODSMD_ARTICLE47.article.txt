Coaches abhor optimism, and it is (
i trifle early in the season to make
iredictions, but judging from the
narks in the Olympic Club-U.S.C. i
neet last week-end, it may not be
iuch a tough spring after ail—that |
s, for Dink Templeton et al.
Of course, there were plenty of
hings in that meet to make the !
ndian adherents ponder, but none j
-f them were unexpected. Every- '
iody knew that Frankie Wykoff j
ould run a 9:6 century and a 21:2
in long, that McGeagh could do a
:s(j half-mile, lliat Ernie Payne
/as a 23:6 low hurdler and Dicli
Jarber a 24-foot broad-jumper. All
f that was interesting and true, but |
lardly new. *

On the other hand, there were a
■w other marks and times that
light offer food for thought. Tem
leton v/ill doubtless be glad to j
now that Bob Hall did only 4G
•et in the shot and 14.'] feet in the
iscus, that McKenzie led the Tro
m spearmen with a toss of 184 feet, j
nd that Wocssner won the quar- j
•rmile in 49:4. Also that Gericke j
f the Olympic Club, vanquished !
y Aebersold of Stanford in the
■vo-mile, Jed all the S.C. distance
lpn to the tape. All those things
elp, you know.
So much for track, then. For j
lose who take their baseball seri- i
jsly, there is a luscious morsel
waiting when the Indians meet the
ears on the diamond. That is the
ay when Norm Horner, the axe- !
ss wonder, who can pitch like no
idy's business nevertheless, op- j
)ses Dan Johnson of Stanford on I
ie mound.
Horner has always been able to j
?at the Indians. Last year he was
msidered the college league's pre- ;
ier hurler, and he has been going i
•eat guns again this year. But it
the opinion of many, the writer
eluded, that Johnson has more j
i:ff and better control than any j
llegiate pitcher row extant in this '
ate, and thai goes for Mr. Horner,

The Stanford sophomore is one
ol customer on the hill, and as
urner is likewise calm, cold, and
Uected when dishing up mysti
ing slants, the atmosphere should
practically sub-zero when the
ir hook up. At all events, it will
a splendid spectacle—we hope.
