### 
Breaking even with the Troians
and the Bruins in four games played
during ,the spring vacation, the i
barnstorming Indian baseball squad
returned to the Farm this morning
| with an official league standing of
eight games won, two games lost, to
rank second in the conference race. '
California is in first place with -j
i eleven won and one lost.
The Cards won both first games
with the two teams and then ;
dropped the second to each team.
Keeping the sons of Troy completely
in submission, Dan Johnson shut 1
out Southern California in the first
game of the series, allowing only
three hits and giving no passes,
while the Stanford hitters collected
four. runs.
Johnson Stars
With four hits to his credit and
Ihe best fielding play of the day,
Dykes Johnson was the most im- j
prcssive Redshirt on the field.
Inability to find a pitcher who
could locate the plate was the cause
of Stanford's first league defeat of
the season, when the Trojans >
crashed through with a 10-5 victory
in the second game. ,
Bruins Trounced
Millsap and Eddie between them
held the Bruins to six runs in the
first U.C.L.A. game, while their
mates\ were manufacturing 12, to j
give the Indians the eighth league i
win.
Johnson struck out ten men but j
(he Bruins grabbed the second game I
by a 6-5 score. Feeling sure of a i
victory, the Stanford nine loafed
along until it was too late and a be- 1
lated ninth-inning rally was choked j
off when a pop-up bunt enabled the i
Bruins to make a double play.
Probably the outstanding work of
the Stanford team in the South was
at the bat. The boys collected over |
forty hits in four games, an average
that is commendable in any squad ,
playing the game.
