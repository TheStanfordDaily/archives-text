# I.C.4-A. KING
## Kirby Sets Aside His Law Twice a Year and Puts Time On the Big Track Meets of the I.C.4-A 
### Feg Murray, '16 
j Twice every year, when the in
! door and outdoor 1.C.4-A. track and
field meet rolls around, a busy New
York lawyer named Kirby becomes
doubly busy. All legal battles are
forgotten, all other business put
' aside while Gustavus Town Kirby
devotes his entire attention to Ihe
( big games of the Intercollegiate As
| sociation of Amateur Athletes of
America.
Ever since 1896, when young Gus
! was undergraduate president of the
j 1.C.4-A., that body has been his
great hobby. Today he is just as
I enthusiastic about it as he was
thirty-five years ago and I hope he
I feels that all the time and money
he has spent on it have been well
I invested. Certainly the Association
has thrived under his guidance as
'chairman of the Advisory Committee
and referee of all its meets.
Gustavus Town Kirby is a tall,
1 vital individual, a brilliant speaker

! blessed with a rare sense of humor,
• and as fair and impartial a judge
I and referee as could be found any-
I where. For instance, before the 440-
| yard dash, which is run around one
turn in the outdoor 1.C.4-A. meets,
! either at Franklin Field, Philadel
phia, or Soldiers Field, Cambridge,
Referee Kirby advises the athletes
: that he will disqualify any runner
; who cuts across sharply from the
! outside in order to take the "pole"
I or inside (and, therefore, the short
; est) lane.
' But Kirby goes further, and ex
-1 plains how much better it is for the
i runners to cut in gradually, arriving
at or near the pole at the turn, be
cause a straight line is the shortest
| distance between two points, and if
j a runner first cuts across to the pole
near the start of the race and then
i runs straight he will run farther
i than if he runs in a direct line from
| the outside lane at the start to the
j inside lane at the turn.
