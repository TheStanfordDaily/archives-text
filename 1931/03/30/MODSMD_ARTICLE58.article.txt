# ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW REGULATIONS FOR LIBRARY MADE
## Changes In Library Will Facilitate Service Says Van Patten 
### 
An outside returning chule, re
serve books lor the whole year to
be kept downstairs at all times, ar
rangements for taking reserve books
to hospital and convalescent homes,
are a few of the innovations that will
be put into effect this quarter at the
Library, Nathan Van Patten, Direc
tor of University Libraries, an
nounced yesterday afternoon. These
changes will do away with many of
the inconveniences that have been
endured by the students and li
brary staff.
The rearrangement of the reserve
book room will be completed in
about two weeks. All reserved
books, except those for graduate
courses, will then be kept down
stairs. No books will be kept on
open shelves. The borrower may get
his "call card" back as a receipt
after he returns his book.
The chute that will open into the
front portico will be open for use at
all times; regular library books as
well as reserve books may be re
turned here when the library is
closed. After signing for a book it
can be taken anywhere the bor
rower chooses. Hour books may be
signed for beginning at 7 o'clock the
evening before the day they are to
be used.
All reserve books for the whole
year will be kept in the reserve
bdok room at all times. The ones
not in use for a particular quarter
will be kept in locked cases, but
anyone wishing to use them may
get them by asking at the desk. This
change will result in a great saving
of labor to the librarians who have
had to transport more than 7,000
books up and down stairs each
quarter. During a year there are
more than 12,000 books put on re
serve.
