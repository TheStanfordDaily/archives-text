### 
MADRID, March 29 (/P).Â»-While j
Spain observed Palm Sunday with j
special services today, political par- |
tics took advantage of the holiday i
to hold a series of municipal clec- j
toral propaganda meetings through- |
out the country. Meetings of the ,
coalition Republican-Socialist forces j
petitioned the government to free t
all political prisoners.
In several cities thousands of per- .
sons paraded in protest to the im- I
prisonments. The demonstrations |
generally were peaceful and the j
marchers were not molested by j
police. j
In Cadiz, General Ricardo Bur
gucte, who has been dismissed as !
president of the supreme court- 1
martial, started serving a two !
months' sentence at Santa Catalina i
Castle for his political declarations I
Friday. His wife accompanied him 1
there from Madrid.
