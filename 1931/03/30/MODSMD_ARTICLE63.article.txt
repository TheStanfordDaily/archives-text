# NORTH TOWER WORK NEARS COMPLETION ON DRIVE GATEWAY
## 
### 
During the past week the stone
work of the north tower of the new
Palm Drive gateway was completed
and the stone boom was moved to
the other side of the drive ready
to start work immediately on the
other tower.

All that remains to be done with
the north tower is the red tile roof.
The contractor in charge of the
work has guaranteed that both tow
ers will be completed by Alumni
Day, and that the skirting walls and
the landscaping will be completed
by Commencement Day.

The completed tower is 14 feet 10
inches square and will be 29 feet
4 inches high from the base to the
peak of the roof. A six-foot wall of
similar construction, built on a 50-
foot radius curve, will extend from
both towers to the highway. With a
265-foot setback, this area between
the gates and the state highway will
be landscaped.
