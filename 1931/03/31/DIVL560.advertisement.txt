Watersnake Takes
First Place in
Spring Footwear
College wotVien who are always most*
exacting about their shoes, concede
without reservation the distinction
which this genuine watersnake oxford
has attained. Made over a new last
that shows the tendency toward longer
vamp and narrower toe â€”yet so skill
fully designed that the fullest of
Springtime comfort is assured.
In Seasand or Leaf Brown at $10.50
174 University Ave.
