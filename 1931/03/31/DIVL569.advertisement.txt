BOLTS
8 times as strong under super
heat as "before the war"
Trace the evolution of the bolt since 1913
and you trace the amazing post war advance of
power and industrial processes . . . and the
Crane contribution to help make it possible.
In carefree days "before the war," a steel v
bolt was a steel bolt. It was made of any
easily obtained steel that forged easily and
took threads we'll. Industry moved forward
. . . stronger bolts were asked for. Ordinary
steels were improved to tensile strength of
45,000 pounds. Not enough. A bolt with
forged-on head and tensile strength of
50,000 pounds was developed. Still not
enough. Cold rolled steel bolts with tensile
strength of 80,000 pounds were offered.
They had a tendency to snap.
To fully meet the demands of modern high
pressure and temperature technology, Crane
Co. brought out for its cast and forged steel
materials their Triplex steel stud bolts, of
chrome nickel steel with tensile strength of
125,000 pounds. The limit is not yet. Even
now, Crane Co. can supply bolts for valve
bonnets and flanges with tensile strength of
140,000 pounds and retaining strength at
well past iooo° F.
By exhaustive laboratory investigations, long
carefully charted creep tests, detailed study
of service conditions, Crane metallurgists
have helped this development. With the
same scientific methods they have as strik
ingly improved bodies, bonnets, discs and
seats, stems, packing boxes ... so that Crane
valves and fittings can be supplied for higher
pressures and temperatures than have yet
been commercially projected.
