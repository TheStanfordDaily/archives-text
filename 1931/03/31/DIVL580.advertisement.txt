We're certainly glad the
old "U" is "full up" once
more because, frankly,
we've missed our stu
dent customers during

see every one of them
again from now on plus
those new registrants
who can find their way
here. To all we promise
a continuance of that
unstinted service which
has built for us the
large volume of busi
ness and reputation of
which we feel justly
proud.
