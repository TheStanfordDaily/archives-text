* BERLIN, March 30 (TP). —Foreign
Minister Julius Curtis will reply in
the Reichstrat tomorrow to the argu
ments of Foreign Minister Aristide
Briand and Foreign Secretary Ar
thur Henderson against consumma
tion of the Austro-German customs
agreement.
Has Perfect Replies
The spirit in which he will make
his address can hardly leave room
for doubt. Official circles here hold
that Germany has a perfect reply to
virtually all of Briand's charges;
that the world has not been placed
before the accomplished fact because
the fact has not yet been accom
plished, and that Briand's conten
tion that world Opinion is united
against the proposed accord can be
disproved by quotations of public
opinion from the United States, Jap
an and partly from England and
other European countries.
Already at work on his reply, the
foreign minister has informed an
present his counter-arguments with
Austrian friend that he intends to
quiet force, avoiding arty words that
might hurt the susceptibilities of the
other side.
Discord Not Intended
He declared he had acted loyally
throughout with respect to existing
treaties and that nothing is further
from his mind than attempting to
cause discord among European na
tions or springing a surprise by a
secret deal.
He is so convinced of the correct
ness of his views, it was said, that
it is his opinion all Europe ultimate
ly will be converted to the idea the
Austro-German plan represents.
