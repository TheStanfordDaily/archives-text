# L.A.A.G. TRACK MEET WILL BE CRITICAL TEST
## Advance Dope Favors The Southern Clubmen To Defeat Indians 
### Stewart Crawford 
Track enthusiasts on the Farm
who are looking to May 2 and the
Trojan affair for the classic dual
meet of the season would do well to
pause in their doping activities and
give April 4 a little attention, for
next Saturday Dink Templeton and
his athletes journey to Los Angeles
to match strides with the collection
of ex-collegiate all-stars which
make up L.A.A.C.'s track and field
team.
On paper, the southern club looks
to have the edge, though the final
result may hang in the balance until
the last relay runner has crossed
the finish line. In that event, there
is little doubt that the Indians would
come out on top.
Coach Boyd Comstock's organiza
tion has twice proved too much for
Dink's great track squads since the
two teams first met in 1926. That
year the Club mentor brought to
Palo Alto an outfit which over
whelmed the Cardinals, but Stan
ford retaliated in the South in 1927.
Templeton's super-team of 1928
cleaned up everything in sight but
L.A.A.C., which eked out a victory
Over that immortal squad by a very
narrow margin. Two seasons ago the
Indians did not meet the club, but
triumphed last year by a 6914 to
61% score. Three of the four en
counters were decided by the relay.
Howell Injured
Jimmy Howell, Cardinal sprinter
and 440 man, may be out of Satur
day's competition with a pulled
muscle suffered in the Husky meet
last week. This would be unfortun
ate, for the Club relay team includ
ing Clarke, Martin, and Williamson
is capable of pushing the redshirted
relay four to its best effort, which
is potentially better than Stanford's
world-beater of last year,
The field events will give L.A.A.C.
a big advantage, placing the bulk of
the point-getting on the shoulders
of Dink's cinderpath artists. Herman
Brix will have an easy time in the
shot, while Edwards has better than
an even chance to take second in
this event. Walker of the Club is
capable of 24 ft. 6 in. in the broad
jump, about 10 inches too many for
Wally Butler. Wally will have to
carry the burden in the jumping pit
for the entire season, for it is doubt
ful that Arnie West, 24 ft. 7 in.
jumper, will be back in a suit at
all. His pulled muscle is failing to
respond to treatment.

L.A.A.C. should take eight points
in the high jump, as well as in the
pole vault and the javelin. Only in
the discus will Templeton's field
men prove superior.
