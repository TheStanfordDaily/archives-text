# War Rages Over Remains Of Old Roble Gymnasium
## 
### 
While trumpets blare for the
handsome Spanish style gymnasium,
recent speculation lurks about the
fate of the old gym, which has for
37 years sheltered generations of
bloomer-clad 500 in their gymnastic
routine.
Though its ultimate disposal lies
in the hands of Comptroller Roth
and Superintendent Roy H. Button,
there is use for the old walls yet,
as evidenced by the wide range of
suggestions for its metamorphosis.
Bonfire Wood
Roughdom sees in its tradition
mellowed planks the nucelus of next
year's bonfire, but the Stanford
symphony orchestra, having found
it a convenient practise hall, holds
fast its claim to the acoustic capaci
ties of the old building.
Hollywoodian glamor will clothe
the gym, and papier-mache palm
trees take the place of former exer
cising apparatus, if the English Club
is granted its petition to take over
the building as a motion picture stu
dio.
Laundry
While on the other hand, clothes
lines full of swimming suits and

towels will swing above its roof in
the best approved -chinee laundry
fashion, if the choice falls to mem
bers of the gym department, who
look to it to house the future laun
dry.
A freshman committee from Roble,
ever vigilant to commercial enter
prise, plans to convert the main
j floor into a skating rink for a night,
to increase funds toward furnish
ing the new gymnasium.
Torture Chamber
One of the 500 who has had a little
painful experience fighting with the
antiquated showers suggests that
those small chambers be used for
dungeon rooms in which to imprison
violators of the honor code. She
guarantees that the torture therein
| far exceeds • that of expulsion,
i Campus nature-lovers, however,
feel that a little feeling and sympa
| thy is demanded for the local wood
| pecker colony. The feathered red
| heads have for years been using the
I outer walls of the old structure as a
! firstclass beak-sharpening and
| acorn-storing ground. To tear it
down for bonfire fuel would be an
unwarranted invasion on the rights
of the woodpeckers.
