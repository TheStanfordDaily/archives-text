Commissioner Rhoads and Assistant
Commissioner Scattergood today
prepared to extend reorganization of
the Indian Office. New officials
shortly will replace men the com
missioners find do not have a satis

lems. These new workers will have
more executive power, enabling
them to speed up by overlooking
cumbersome procedure heretofore
required.

missioner will take office, one han
dling human relations and one prop
erty. This will be the first time such
a differentiation has been made in

ed by Robert T. Lansdale, former
executive secretaray of the council
of social activities of Montclair, N.J.,
will be ..new divisions for health,
education, industry, and agricultur
al extension. The second group, for
which an assistant to Commissioner

tendents of reservations and institu
tions, Although they believe most
superintendents now in office are
capable of handling their jobs, the
commissionehs plan a few additional
changes. Proportionate changes are
under way in other classes of em
ployees.
