# HYPNOSIS PRODUCING DRUG TO DISPLACE OLD ANAESTHETICS
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS, March 30. (ip)—
Drugs producing hypnotic sleep as
a substitute for anaesthetics in oper
ations were described to the Ameri
can Chemical Society today. The
chemists were informed of more
than 1,000 successful operations al
ready performed in this sleep. The
hypnosis still is quite limited, but
there is hope of a sleep deep enough
for any kind of operation.
The prospects in this pioneer field
were reported in a paper by H. A.
Shonle of Eli Lilly & Company, of
Indianapolis, released by the Chem
ical Society as part of its general
scientific program.
The drug now used is a combina
tion of acids related to banana oil,
grain alcohol, and barbituric acid, a
synthetic substance not translatable
into any familiar terms. The alcohols,
said Dr. Shonle, are the simplest
hypnotics, but of little or no clinical
value, and must be given in doses
50 times greater than barbituric
acid£.
