# THE 						THIN-SKINNED GOLDEN BEAR

Waxing hot under its editorial collar, the Daily Cali
fornian has characterised Stanford's moye in scheduling
the U.S.C. track meet for May 2 this year, two weeks after
the Big Meet, as "a pointedly discourteous act," and a "gra
tuitous insult."
The Berkeley publication charges that Stanford authori
ties, in dropping California from her traditional position
on the schedule, gave as reasons the fact that the Bears
could not offer the competition that the Trojans might, and
that an Indian-Trojan meet late in the season would bring
in larger gate receipts.
The Daily Californicin is wrong on two counts, the first
being the idea that gate receipts had anything to do with
the shift in dates, and second in the thought that Stanford-
California rivalry will he any the less keen on April .18 be
cause the Trojan meet is yet to come.
The main reason behind the scheduling of the U.S.C.
meet for late season was to correct a situation that has
handicapped track teams on the Pacific Slope in their an
nual pilgrimage east to compete in the IC4A meet at Cam
bridgeâ€”lack of competition in the six weeks preceding the
eastern fray. In years previous, Stanford's dual meet sea
son has ended with California, in the middle of April, and
left the athletes with 110 competition until the end of May
save the state intercollegiates. That apparently has not
been sufficient to keep the men on edge, and coaches of the
Indians and Trojans had that in mind in arranging for the
later date.
Secondly, while there is no doubt that gate receipts play
a major part in the intercollegiate athletic program today,
the Californian's charge that Stanford had the gate receipts
in mind in changing the schedule, is little short of ridicu
lous, the attendance at track meets being what it is. The
Big Meet has always come in mid-season, with both the
California Intercollegiate and the IC4A meets following
it, and obviously, has never been considered the grand
climax of the sport for the year, as is the case in football,
and basketball.
There is no doubt whatsoever that the Indians will take
just as much pleasure in beating the Blue and (fold tvack
sters this year as they have for the past seven years, so just
where the Californian gets off' with its moans of "dis
courtesy" and "insults" is hard to figure.
