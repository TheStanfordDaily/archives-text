# THE KLAN INVADES THE COLLEGE
## 
### 
Eight students at the University of Kansas have formed
an organization to enforce the recently adopted anti-liquor
resolution of the Kansas fraternities. The Daily Kansan
was informed of the new organization as follows:
"To Whom it May Concern:
"In reply to the so-called 'clearance resolution' passed
by the men's Pan-Hellenic assdciation and student councils,
we, a group of eight students, with the cooperation of an
outside group, are taking it upon ourselves to see that these
promises are fulfilled.
"Among the student body we hope to gather sufficient
information to rid the campus of its student drinkers and
bootleggers and see that your diplomatic 'blanks' are not
idle threats.
"—The Group of Eight."
It seems fairly evident just what "outside group" lies
behind this society of noble vigilante. The Kansas calls
them "white-caps."
The spirit of the Klan is by no means dead. Whether
or not this group is definitely connected with that organiza
tion, it is clear it is in its spirit that the new student organi
zation has been founded. Nor is the Klannish spirit without
others to carry on its medieval banner. We have no lack of
witch-burners. If the Klan has for the moment retired from
active part in the contemporary campaign against freedom,
it has its torch-bearers among organizations somewhat
more respectable at the moment. Consider the D.A.R. and
its blacklist, the American Legion and its attempted ex
clusion of Dr. Einstein from the state of California, con
sider the Coal and Iron Police, the San Francisco chamber
of commerce and its activities in the matter of Mooney and
Billings.
Certainly this is no era of great advancement. We have
got rid of the ducking-stool, but there are plenty of equiva
lents. We advice the Daily Kansan to get busy on the local
substitute.— The Daily Cardinal (Univ. of Wisconsin).

The editorial staff will meet at 1 o'clock this afternoon
in the DAILY office.
