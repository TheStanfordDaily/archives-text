The Editor:
In view of the recent criticism of
the junior college as expressed in
the editorial columns of the Stanford
Daily, I trust that a word in its
defense will be permitted.
The editor seizes upon a single,
isolated incident (the proposed
"strike" at San Mateo) as the basis
for the highly interesting conclusion
that the junior college is not an in
tegral part of our educational sys
tem. Would the editor carry his
argument to its logical conclusion
and assert that the university is not
an integral part of our educational
system on account of the proposed
strike at the dental school of the
University of California? Would he
assert that the agricultural college
is not an integral part of the educa
tional system on account of the re
cently proposed walkout at the Uni
versity of Minnesota Farm School?
Possibly university students are en
dowed with the inherent right to
strike, a privilege not to be shared
by junior college students \without
loss of status in the educational sys
tem. Whether or not this is true, the
number of proposed strikes and
walkouts at colleges and universities
in the past year, the past five years,
or the past ten years far outnum
bers similar situations at junior col
leges.
The statement that the junior col
lege is not an integral part of the
educational system of this country
is almost equivalent to saying that
the railroad is not an integral part
of the transportation system—a
thoroughly "ostrich" point of view.
At present there are more than 450
junior colleges in the United States,
many of which have existed and
prospered over a long period of
years. The property valuation alone
of these institutions is far in excess
of $100,000,000.
Recent studies have shown rather
Startling comparisons between jun
ior college transfers to universities
and "native" university students.
Investigations at universities on the
Pacific Coast show that transfers

IN DEFENSE OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE

| are "superior both in academic abil
; ity and achievement."
The participation of junior college
transfers in athletics at Stanford,
I University of California, and Uni
| versity of Southern California is
| considerably in advance of the "ex
pectancy." That is, the percentage
j of positions on varsity squads held
I by junior college transfers (as shown
!by Pacific Coast Conference lists)
|is much greater than the junior
j college transfer group is of the total
I undergraduate eligible group. Fur
j thermore, the percentage of "par
j ticipation" is constantly and rapidly
i increasing.
Participation in extra-curricular
activities at the University of Cali
! fornia has been studied by a com
! mittee of the Welfare Council of the
! Associated Students, and also by
|L. C. Gilbert of the U.C. faculty.
I These studies show that the junior
i college transfer participates to a
I large degree in university activities
j of all kinds, and compares very fa
i vorably with "native" students in
i this respect.
With regard to a statement made
i some time ago concerning the atti
| tude of the early administration of
j Stanford University toward the low
j er division, Dr. Jordan's presidential
message for 1907 expressed the hope
j that the lower division would be
| entirely eliminated by 1913. A study
| of Dr. Jordan's writings shows that
| he foresaw and greatly favored the
j establishment of a complete system
| of junior colleges.
j It is furthermore interesting to
! note that the Junior College Jour
| nal, the official organ of the Ameri
l can Association of Junior Colleges,
| is published by the Stanford Uni
versity Press, and that the editor is
; Dr. W. C. Eells of the Stanford fac
j ulty. Stanford has long been re
j garded as the leader in the junior
| college movement on the Pacific
i Coast.

The Editor:
In view of the recent criticism of
the junior college as expressed in
the editorial columns of the Stanford
Daily, I trust that a word in its
defense will be permitted.
The editor seizes upon a single,
isolated incident (the proposed
"strike" at San Mateo) as the basis
for the highly interesting conclusion
that the junior college is not an in
tegral part of our educational sys
tem. Would the editor carry his
argument to its logical conclusion
and assert that the university is not
an integral part of our educational
system on account of the proposed
strike at the dental school of the
University of California? Would he
assert that the agricultural college
is not an integral part of the educa
tional system on account of the re
cently proposed walkout at the Uni
versity of Minnesota Farm School?
Possibly university students are en
dowed with the inherent right to
strike, a privilege not to be shared
by junior college students \without
loss of status in the educational sys
tem. Whether or not this is true, the
number of proposed strikes and
walkouts at colleges and universities
in the past year, the past five years,
or the past ten years far outnum
bers similar situations at junior col
leges.
The statement that the junior col
lege is not an integral part of the
educational system of this country
is almost equivalent to saying that
the railroad is not an integral part
of the transportation system—a
thoroughly "ostrich" point of view.
At present there are more than 450
junior colleges in the United States,
many of which have existed and
prospered over a long period of
years. The property valuation alone
of these institutions is far in excess
of $100,000,000.
Recent studies have shown rather
Startling comparisons between jun
ior college transfers to universities
and "native" university students.
Investigations at universities on the
Pacific Coast show that transfers

IN DEFENSE OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE

| are "superior both in academic abil
; ity and achievement."
The participation of junior college
transfers in athletics at Stanford,
I University of California, and Uni
| versity of Southern California is
| considerably in advance of the "ex
pectancy." That is, the percentage
j of positions on varsity squads held
I by junior college transfers (as shown
!by Pacific Coast Conference lists)
|is much greater than the junior
j college transfer group is of the total
I undergraduate eligible group. Fur
j thermore, the percentage of "par
j ticipation" is constantly and rapidly
i increasing.
Participation in extra-curricular
activities at the University of Cali
! fornia has been studied by a com
! mittee of the Welfare Council of the

I These studies show that the junior
i college transfer participates to a
I large degree in university activities
j of all kinds, and compares very fa
i vorably with "native" students in
