The current Washington rumor
that Herbert Hoover's trip to the
Virgin Islands and Porto Rico was
for the purpose of drafting Teddy
Roosevelt Jr. as Vice-Presidential
candidate in 1932 as well as a much
needed rest is of much interest.
First of all it shows the value of
a name. Teddy Junior's claim to
fame is twofold—first, he bears the
same name as did his father, and
second, he has a sister, a very clever
politician. Further than this, no one
has been able to determine wherein
lies his vote-getting ability.
The vital significance, however, of
this rumor is that it is an admission
by the President that he is weak;
and especially that his weakness will
be clearly accentuated in a contest
with the governor of New York—
another Roosevelt who happens to
be a Democratic presidential possi
bility in 1932.
Stanford's famous son entered the
White House esteemed, honored, and
almost worshipped as the living in
carnatio nof efficiency. By placing
himself above politics, he showed
excellent political tact and as a re
sult was swept into office with mil
lions of votes to spare.
At the present time, however, it
is openly prophesied that either
Owen D. Young or Franklin D.
Roosevelt could beat him and some
even go so far as to claim that he
will not be able to force through his

own re-nomination. He is openly at
tacked throughout the land—once
made prosperous by Calvin Coolidge.
The farmers claim he favors "Big
Business" ana "business" claims the
stock market goes down every time
he makes a comment; the drys feel
he has failed to enforce "the ex
periment, noble in purpose" (and
costly in practice), and the wets
brand him as a "Puritan."
What has caused this complete re
versal of public sentiment? First of
all, there was a stock market crash,
then a drought, followed by a tariff,
succeeded by a depression of in
creasingly alarming proportions.
Hoover was responsible for none of
this; and yet is blamed for all. The
crash was self-caused; the drought
was an act of God; the tariff can be
blamed on those Democrats who
acted like Republicans and voted
for the bill; and the depression was
due to economics (which is below
politics, and as Hoover is above
politics, he clearly cannot be blamed
for the depression).
But despite this complete vindica
tion, it is rumored that Hoover is
seeking to find a stronger running
mate than Chief Charlie ("bait-for
the-farmers") Curtis.

himself above politics, he showed
excellent political tact and as a re
sult was swept into office with mil
lions of votes to spare.
At the present time, however, it
is openly prophesied that either
Owen D. Young or Franklin D.
Roosevelt could beat him and some
even go so far as to claim that he
will not be able to force through his

own re-nomination. He is openly at
tacked throughout the land—once
made prosperous by Calvin Coolidge.
The farmers claim he favors "Big
Business" ana "business" claims the
stock market goes down every time
he makes a comment; the drys feel
he has failed to enforce "the ex
periment, noble in purpose" (and
costly in practice), and the wets
brand him as a "Puritan."
What has caused this complete re
versal of public sentiment? First of
all, there was a stock market crash,
then a drought, followed by a tariff,
succeeded by a depression of in
creasingly alarming proportions.
Hoover was responsible for none of
this; and yet is blamed for all. The
crash was self-caused; the drought
was an act of God; the tariff can be
blamed on those Democrats who
acted like Republicans and voted
for the bill; and the depression was
due to economics (which is below
politics, and as Hoover is above
politics, he clearly cannot be blamed
for the depression).
But despite this complete vindica
tion, it is rumored that Hoover is
seeking to find a stronger running
mate than Chief Charlie ("bait-for
the-farmers") Curtis.
The current Washington rumor
that Herbert Hoover's trip to the
Virgin Islands and Porto Rico was
for the purpose of drafting Teddy
Roosevelt Jr. as Vice-Presidential
candidate in 1932 as well as a much
needed rest is of much interest.
First of all it shows the value of
a name. Teddy Junior's claim to
fame is twofold—first, he bears the
same name as did his father, and
second, he has a sister, a very clever
politician. Further than this, no one
has been able to determine wherein
lies his vote-getting ability.
The vital significance, however, of
this rumor is that it is an admission
by the President that he is weak;
and especially that his weakness will
be clearly accentuated in a contest
with the governor of New York—
another Roosevelt who happens to
be a Democratic presidential possi
bility in 1932.
Stanford's famous son entered the
White House esteemed, honored, and
almost worshipped as the living in
carnatio nof efficiency. By placing
himself above politics, he showed
excellent political tact and as a re
sult was swept into office with mil
lions of votes to spare.
