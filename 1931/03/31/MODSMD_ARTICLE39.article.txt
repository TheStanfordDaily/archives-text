GRAND HOTEL. By Vicki Baum.
Doubleday, Doran. Garden City,
New York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Sitting before a revolving door, a
cynical doctor, maimed in the war,
watched the people coming in and
going out, and he noticed that they
changed after a -visit to the Grand
Hotel.
The actress, growing older, lonely,
sad, puts the fatal dose in the cup.
The dashing baron-burglar, about
to steal her pearls, takes the cup
from her, and she loves him. The
poor little workman, with three
months to live, finds beauty, wealth,
and perhaps health. The ruthless and
wealthy business man finds disgrace.
"Grand Hotel" is clever, and dra
matic, but too obviously novelized
from the author's original play of
that name. The first half is swift and
clear, and tensely realistic. Then
the author seems to be burdened by
her original plan of changing the
lives of her characters, and rushes
to a picture of each.
In spite of the unfortunate treat
ment of the second half, in spite of
the fact that it should have been
left a play, "Grand Hotel" has no
trouble in holding a reader's inter
est. —J. N.
PRIVATE LIVES. By Noel Coward.
Doubleday, Doran. $1.75.
Noel Coward, that prolific but
consistently entertaining young Eng
lishman, might quite as easily have
named his play "Interlude in a Mad
house." "Private Lives" fails to sug
gest even faintly the uproar.
"Private Lives" is two hours of
entertaining repartee with one
frightened little lick of philosophy
of the "joie de vivre" variety, and
occasional lapses when hero and
heroine roll about on the floor to

the great delight of the most sophis
ticated audience.
The play makes no pretense to
greatness nor does it assert a right
to longevity. Written d firing a
week's illness while jaunting around
the world, it merely proves again
Noel Coward's ability to dash off
frothy and amusing nonsense.

RICH AND STRANGE. By Hough
ton-Mifflin, 1931. At the Palo Alto
Book Store.
This is an unusually readable
book in which the author has con
trived to point a moral without be
ing either too obvious or too ob
scure.
A young couple leading a dull
and uninteresting life in a cheap
suburb of London dream of travel,
riches, and the better things in life,
suddenly to find themselves the re
cipients of a small fortune left to
them by a rich and very wise uncle
with the stipulation that it must all
be spent on a trip around the world.
Both husband and wife fall desper
ately in love with other passengers
and only achieve a readjustment
when they are shipwrecked.
Unfortunately the ending smacks
perhaps too much of Hollywood, but
the author gets around this diffi
culty with the very ingeniously
worked-out though not original plan
of introducing himself into the story
as another passenger on the round
the-world trip. By making the read
er laugh ,at him and thq ideas of
authors makes the story seem
more possible.
Despite the seeming lightness of
the plot there are touches that show
deep insight into the difficulties and
petty targedies of life and one feels
that the author has presented an
interesting idea in an interesting
way. —S. C. A.
