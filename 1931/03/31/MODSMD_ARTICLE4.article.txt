smeller" is ready for use by po
lice, enforcement officers and
suspicious spouses.

drunkenness, merely by catch
ing some of the drinker's
breath, and is so sensitive that
it detects alcohol even when
all odor is expurgated from the
breath.
A description of the appara
tus was made public today by
the American Chemical Society
at whose meeting here it will
be demonstrated this week in
the act of trapping alcoholic
breath. It was perfected by
Dr. R. N. Hager of the Medical
School of the University of
Indiana.
The suspected breath is
blown into a 10-cent-store toy
balloon. From there it is bub
bled through a red liquid,
which speedily turns almost
