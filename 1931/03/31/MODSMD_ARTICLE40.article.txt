# Cabbages and Things

### 
There's no hope for anybody's san
ity, and thank fortune there's only
one Spring vacation a year. Your
friends all grouch over the way you
look, the way they feel, the courses
they aren't taking, and the cut of
the new golf knickers you borrow
on the first afternoon.
The sun's hot, but it's cold in
the morning; eight o'clocks are
a blasted nuisance; there's not a
cubic centimeter of wetness in
the lake, and the reeds at Sears
ville even have a head start.
Everyone that was ever fun to
play poker with has either flunked
or graduatedâ€”it doesn't make much
difference which you do. You're out
for a long time anyway. And every
one you expected to flunk, and
hoped to be rid of for awhile, is
back, off of pro, and planning to
type from midnight to six every one
of the seventy-seven (count 'em)
nights till summer.
Nobody even knows any new
jokes that are worth repeating;
or else they forget the points of
the things. Of course, there is
one good 6ne about the two
Scotchmen ....
Meanwhile, every girl on campus
who ever played the part of Con
trary Mary or sang a song about
the Lost Sheep in kindergarten, is
tripping merrily about with two
likewise friends, attempting to crash
the Junior Opera cast. Something to
keep your spare hours occupied, and
then there's always exercise for the

! ankle, in the chorus, sisters.
Oh, and another gripe against
the weather: it doesn't match
our diamond dispositions. Any
how, we've a couple of reverse
scores to wonder about. Univer
sity or no, S.C. is one whale of
a good sporting corporation.
What to do?
j Again we wail the passing of the
rough. Even Paly High classifies his

modern successor as "the kind of a
guy who sends perfumed letters to
himself." How does it feel?
Women new to the . campus in
Spring quarter have an advantage
over their winter sisters. They are
also allowed to observe new porch j
furniture and ping pong tables along '

with cozy fireplaces and stuay ta
bles. Ah, for life in a Greek man
sion!
Four Chilean political refugees,
rescued from Easter Island in the
South Pacific under the guise of
I movie actors are awaiting a ship to
i San Francisco.
