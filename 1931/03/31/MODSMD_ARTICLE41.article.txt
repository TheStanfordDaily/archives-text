Expressions of mixed satisfac
tion and relief spread over the
countenances of those 25 red
shirted tracksters who trounced
the Huskies at Seattle as they
dug their spikes into good old
mother earth again after that
dual affair in the frozen north
land where track meets are held
indoors. Yesterday afternoon's
practice found most of them able
to run in a straight line, show
ing a surprisingly rapid recov
ery from the dizziness which
must result from running on a
track with 110 less than 16 turns
per mile!

Though 87 to 44 is a plenty large
'margin, the result of the meet was
mo surprise to the dopesters. Somq
.of the individual performances of
Dink Templeton's men deserve note,
however, especially Paul Aebersold's
'9:55.4 in the two-mile. Maybe it was
»something about the indoor air, or
, perhaps Paul is just naturally good
when running in a circle, but why
he should wait till he encountered
'a 220-yard hard indoor track to run
►his best race of the season remains
,a mystery. That 9:53.8 that he turned
in against the Olympic Club looks
"better, of course, but put a 9:55.4
►out in the open on a regulation
.track and you have something like
9:50.
Q •$> <«>
Along last winter when bas
► ketball held the limelight and
few heads were yet bothered
about track prospects, Dink
Templeton predicted that the
1 Indians would take the Trojans
1 if the Farm weightmen. came
along fast enough to fill the
shoes of the departed Messrs.
I Rothert and Krenz. Then came
the mighty heave of 157 feet by
Bob Jones against the Winged
"O," and the Cardinal cause
soared. Again at Seattle last
Saturday Jones tossed the plat
ter out past 155 feet, showing
that he is up there to stay. But
even more significant were the
tosses of Norm McCleod and
Here Laborde, whose marks
against the Huskies of 150 ft.
3 in. and 148 ft. 8 in., respec
tively, hint of a clean sweep for
Stanford on May 2. Unless Mr.
Hall of Troy can better his 143
ft. 5 in. mark against the Olym
pians Saturday, fans can put
nine points in the bag right now!

No one should cry because the
baseball nine lost two out of four
in the South during the vacation.
Keeping a clean slate up to the
I second U.S.C. contest was quite
some record, and the horsehide art
-1 ists deserve a big hand for plenty
. 'of good work this season. Dan John -
[ son's pitching in that first Troy
S game was as good hurling as any
one might wish to see in collegiate
' ball.
❖ <» <♦>
Splitting with U.S.C. was all
right. It could /not be helped,
since Ban was used in the first
game, and that left Wolter with
out a pitcher good enough to
stop the heavy hitting S.C.
horde. The Bruins, however,
benefitted by what seemed to be
a lamentable mental slump on
the part of the Indians. After
taking the first Ucla encounter
, without the services of John
son, Stanford fell down in the
m 1
second with him on the mound.
f Perhaps the boys were a triflle
over-confident, or maybe they
forgot that it takes more than
just a stellar pitcher to win ball
games. —Crawford.
