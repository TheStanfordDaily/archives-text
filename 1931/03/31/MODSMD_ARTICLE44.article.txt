# Indians Practice for Two Important Games
## CARDS WILL PLAY U.S.C., CALIFORNIA.' AT END OF WEEK Weakness In Base-Running And Bunting Will Be Dealt With 
### Francis Lloyd 
With two important games sched
uled for Friday and Saturday with
the Trojans and California, Harry
Wolter's baseball team intends to
I practice hard on certain weaknesses
which were evident during the
southern trip. Who will pitch against
Southern California will very large
ly depend on this Peek's showing.
Too many men were left stranded
on the paths during the four games
i down South. Although the Indian
! batters collected a very fine total
of hits, these base blows often failed
to materialize in the pinch. A fur
ther attack of blinditis came over
the Card base-runners much, to the
apparent joy of the opposition.
Dykes Johnson Starred
The bright particular star in the
Redshirt lineup was Dykes Johnson,
guardian of the third sack. Johnson
gathered nine out of 18 hits in the
four tilts. Added to his steady hit
ting, the Card third-baseman per- •
■ formed, brilliantly in his fielding,
j turning any safe hits into outs with
j his bujjlet-like peg.
Always diplomatic, the Southern
| Pacific Railroad placed Sam Barry's
I outfit from U.S.C. in the first sec
j tion of the "Lark" coming up Sun
| day nighf, while the Indians were
consigned to the second section. The
Trojans got off at San Jose where
they started a hectic five days of
successive games with the northern
teams.
Buchanan to Pitch
Buchanan, flashy Trojan sopho
more pitcher, will probably meet
the Indians on Friday which will be
his second game in five days. The
Bears will be called on to solve the
slow deceptive curves of Griffith
when they encounter the sons of
Troy on Thursday, a bit of diagnosis
the Redshirts could not succeed in.
Can either Santa Clara, St. Mary's,
or San Francisco University take a
game from the hard-hitting men
from the South? Fans of college
baseball in the bay district have
noted the sudden spurt of Walter
Mails's Broncos, who have not lost
a game in four starts. It may be
that Santa Clara will be the team
to decide the three-cornered race
between California, U.S.C., and
Stanford.
