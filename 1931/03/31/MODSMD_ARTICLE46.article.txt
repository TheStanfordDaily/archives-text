# HEALTHY WIVES RATE FIRST WITH PENN MEN
## 
### 
Putting little value on looks, fam
ily connections, and wealth, men
students at the University of Penn
sylvania would prefer their wives
to be healthy and companionable,
it was revealed in a questionnaire
given to students at a combined
meeting of the Young People's So
cieties there. Personality, disposi
tion, honesty, ability to make a good
home, natural mental ability, sex
purity, mutual intellectual interests,
education, and sexual attractiveness
were also rated high by the Penn
sylvania men.
Women students at Pennsylvania
put health first, too, but honesty was
ranked second. Men with comrade
ship, ambition, education, mutual in
tellectual interests, sexual attrac
tiveness, disposition, sex purity, na
tural mental ability, interest in re
ligion, and personality were favored.
