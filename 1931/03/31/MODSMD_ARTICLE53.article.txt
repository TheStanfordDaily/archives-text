# LIFE GUARDS NEEDED AT NEW ROBLE POOL
## 
### 
All women holding the Senior
Red Cross Lifesaving Certificate
who are willing to act as life guards
in the new women's "pool are asked
to notify Miss Gertrude Hawley as
soon as possible.
There will be no regular life
guard as ihere was last quarter, due
to lack of funds. Instead the posi
tion will be filled by several Stan
ford students, a practice carried out
in past years.
The pool will be filled for classes
tomorrow, with open hours every
day from 5 to 6 o'clock.
