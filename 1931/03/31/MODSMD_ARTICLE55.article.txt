## Jimmy Willson Is Entirely Recovered From His Leg Injury 
### 
Bill Ellington, freshman track
coach, faces the prospect during this
week of whipping his team into
shape after their ten-day layoff for
their meet with the powerful San
Jose team next Saturday.
Furthermore, the babes' annual
clash with the Bear frosh takes place
on April 10, just a week from next
Friday.
Jimmy Wiilson, premier frosh
sprinter, is fully recovered from the
leg injury which kept him out of
the Sacramento meet in which the
freshmen suffered their only defeat
of the season by a 68-58 score.
The San Frahcisco All-Stars,
Menlo and Alameda junior colleges
are the teams over whom the babes
hold victories. The first-mentioned
team lost 83-47, while the babes
topped the" latter two in a triangular
meet, 61-51-42.
Packard, who is a sure point
getter for the frosh in three events,
the high and low hurdles and broad
jump, will have his work cut out
for him in the San Jose meet. He is
to face a hurdler who has cut 25
seconds in the lows and 15 3-5 in
the highs.
Lyman, Stanford's sensational
freshman shotputter, has gotten the
16-pound bail out 48 feet once this
season; so he should take his spe- 1
cialty with little difficulty.
