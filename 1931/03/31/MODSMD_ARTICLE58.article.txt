# INDIAN RACKETMEN HILL NEET TEAMS FROM SOUTH HERE
## U.C.L.A. With Addition Of Robbins And Lewis Will Be Dangerous 
### 
Coming at the same time as the
minor sports tournament, the best
tennis matches to be witnessed at
Stanford this year v/ill be held here
next Friday and Saturday.
U.C.L.A., the Indian racketmen's
toughest opponents, will have a
chance to avenge last week's defeat
in the return matches Friday. Their
invasion will have added strength
due to the presence of Cliff Robbins,
second man, back in the lineup, and
the partial recovery of Elbert Lewis,
who was handicapped in the south
ern matches by torn leg ligaments.
Somewhat less menacing, the Tro
jans, who fell last week along with
U.C.L.A. by a 7 to 2 score, will
take the local courts Saturday. It is
probable that the same team, which
consisted of Keith Gledhill, Captain
Ted. Easton, Harry Plymire, Joe
Coughlin, Trow Stephens, Phil Nie
derauer, and Wilbur Cox, will face
the invaders this week.
This combination functioned to
perfection in the Los Angeles
matches, winning almost every
singles encounter in straight sets,
with the exception of Stephens, who
ran into some powerful opposition
and lost both his matches.
Another seemingly unsuccessful
performance was displayed by the
Cox-Niederauer combination, who
dropped both their doubles tilts to
the southern outfits. Due to these
exceptions to the otherwise high
success of the varsity men, it is pos
sible that a few changes in the line
up may occur.
