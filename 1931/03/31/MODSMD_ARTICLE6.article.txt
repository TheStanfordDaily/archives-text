# INDIA ACCEPTS BRITISH TRUCE
## Ghandi Appears Personally To Support Measure 
### 
KARACHI, India, March 30 (/P).—
Despite fierce opposition from the
extremist wing, Mahatma Gandhi's
truce with Viceroy Irwin was ap
proved today by unanimous vote of
delegates to the all-Indip. congress.
After a series of fiery speeches,
Gandhi himself took the stand to
support passage of the resolution.
When he finished the gathering
broke into resounding cheers. There
was not a single dissenting vote
when President Vallabhai Patel put
the question.
Makes No Promises
"Do not accept this truce merely
because I made it," Gandhi said."
"You are free to reject it and ap
point another working committee."
"I give you no promise I will bring
back complete independence from
the second round table conference
but I do give you my pledge I will
not bring back greater bondage than
exists in India today."
The oppositionists declared in ef
fect that the Delhi pact was inade
quate in that it represented victory
for England rather than for the Na
tionalists, and that it was not in
conformity with the Lahore resolu
tion declaring for outright inde
pendence.
Terms of Truce
Under the terms of the truce, the
Nationalists definitely commit them
selves to the idea of a federated
India, Indian responsibility with re
servations or safeguards for prob
lems of defense, finance and foreign
affairs, protection of minorities and
discharge of the country's' financial
obligations.
