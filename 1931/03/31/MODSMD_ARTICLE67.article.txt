# BATTLESHIP STILL REGARDED AS CHIEF NAVAL STRONGHOLD

WASHINGTON, Mar. 30 (/P).â€”
Despite the development of aviation
the battleship still is regarded by
Admiral Pratt as the basis of naval
power. The chief of naval opera
tions expressed this view today upon
returning from naval maneuvers in
Panama waters.

"You can't make a lightweight
fighter take the place of a heavy
weight either in the ring or on the
sea," he said. "No aviation develop
ment can remove our need for bat
tleships.
"Unless supported by surface
strength, no air force,, however
powerful, can halt the slow, steady
advance of heavy ships. Airplanes
can bomb them and hurt them, but
they can't stop them."
Admiral Pratt said the navy can
use the 135,000 tons of aircraft car
riers allotted it by the Washington
treaty. He added the navy needed
about two more light cruisers carry
ing six inch guns. He said it would
be difficult to determine the value
of cruisers with flying decks until
one had been built and tested.
