WASHINGTON, March 30 (£»).—
The Standard Oil Company of Indi
ana will put into effect immediately
a substantial reduction not only of
petroleum imports to the United

zuelan wells.
This was made known today by
Secretary Wilbur, just back from
the Caribbean trip with President
Hoover. The actual amount to be
curtailed was not given but it was
said to be proportionate to the
slashes announced by Standard Oil
of New Jersey, the Dutch Shell
Company and the Gulf interests.
