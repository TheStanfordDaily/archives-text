# Thornhill Recalls Bits Of Rockne's Early Days
## 
### 
Glimpses of the old Knute Rockne
iof early graduate days were gaih
i ered yesterday from the remini
scences of Line Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill, who played as Rockne's
teammate for three years on a pro
fessional football team in Masslin,
j Ohio.
Though never markedly boyish in
appearance, the young Rockne as a
I fresh college graduate, slouchy in
j dress, dynamic, as always, and a
I good talker, exercised a penchant
for practical jokes on his team-
I mates.
A Practical Joker
In a Detroit game, Thornhill at
i tackle noted the absence of Rockne,
j who was supposed to be defending
i the neighboring end position. Since
!he had just been exhorted by
j Rockne to fight harder, Thornhill
j wondered at the sudden disappear
| ance. Several seconds later he dis
j covered Rockne directly behind
him, keeping under the shelter of
I Thornhill's shoulders.
"Well, do you think I want to be
squashed by all that interference?"
he queried blandly at Thornhill's
j indignant protest.

The great Notre Dame mentor was
an aviation enthusiast in recent
years, Thornhill declared. With a
sportsman's love of action, he had
enjoyed flying, and was to begin
using a plane to travel about his
widespread activities as a director
in the Studebaker corporation.
Rocknc a Fatalist
Despite his happy-go-lucky dis
position, the Norwegian coach was
a fatalist, Thornhill asserted. But
he did not expect precipitate death,
or at least fought against its recog
nition by his plans for the distant
future, the experiments he planned
to work out in football "before I
knock off," and the staunch asser
tions of outlasting all the doctors
who treated and warned him dur
ing his recent illness.
Football loses a resolute defender,
a constructive experimenter, and a
picturesque leader, in Thornhill's
words. Hunk Anderson, line coach
at Notre Dame, will continue the
spring practice, he believes, but an
1 older Notre Dame product, as Char
lie Bachman, now head coach at
Florida, or Gus Dorias of Detroit,
may be imported to fill the inimi
table Rocknc shoes.

teammate for three years on a pro
fessional football team in Masslin,
j Ohio.
Though never markedly boyish in
appearance, the young Rockne as a
I fresh college graduate, slouchy in
j dress, dynamic, as always, and a
I good talker, exercised a penchant
for practical jokes on his team-
I mates.
A Practical Joker
In a Detroit game, Thornhill at
i tackle noted the absence of Rockne,
j who was supposed to be defending
i the neighboring end position. Since
!he had just been exhorted by
j Rockne to fight harder, Thornhill
j wondered at the sudden disappear
| ance. Several seconds later he dis
j covered Rockne directly behind
him, keeping under the shelter of
I Thornhill's shoulders.
"Well, do you think I want to be
squashed by all that interference?"
he queried blandly at Thornhill's
j indignant protest.

The great Notre Dame mentor was
an aviation enthusiast in recent
years, Thornhill declared. With a
sportsman's love of action, he had
enjoyed flying, and was to begin
using a plane to travel about his
widespread activities as a director
in the Studebaker corporation.
Rocknc a Fatalist
Despite his happy-go-lucky dis
position, the Norwegian coach was
a fatalist, Thornhill asserted. But
he did not expect precipitate death,
or at least fought against its recog
nition by his plans for the distant
future, the experiments he planned
to work out in football "before I
knock off," and the staunch asser
tions of outlasting all the doctors
who treated and warned him dur
ing his recent illness.
Football loses a resolute defender,
a constructive experimenter, and a
picturesque leader, in Thornhill's
words. Hunk Anderson, line coach
at Notre Dame, will continue the
spring practice, he believes, but an
1 older Notre Dame product, as Char
lie Bachman, now head coach at
Florida, or Gus Dorias of Detroit,
may be imported to fill the inimi
table Rocknc shoes.
