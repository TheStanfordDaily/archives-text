# A CAPPELLA CHOIR TO SING FRIDAY IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
The A Chappella Choir of the
University of California at Los
Angeles, under the direction of
Squire Coop, will sing at a special
service in the Memorial Church on
Good Friday evening at 8 o'clock.
In view of the fact that the Uni
versity Choir is studying the same
type of music as the program offered
by the Los Angeles group, it will be
of special interest to the campus
community and Palo Alto music
lovers, stated Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist, yesterday.
In reporting a recent concert by
the U.C.L.A. choir, a Los Angeles
newspaper stated that the choir
deserves to rank with the major
professional organizations of its
type. More than that, the ability of
(he students is further enhanced by
the unspoiled freshness of their
young voices and the freedom from
professional mechanics and conven
tions.
The program will include Tchai
kowsky's "Legend" and Rossini's
"Stabat Mater."
