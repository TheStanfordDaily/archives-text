# ITALIAN SPEAKS ON LITERATURE
## Epic, Lyrical Poetry Mark Italian Literature 
### 
In Italian literature there is a
marvelous welding of epic and lyri
cal poetry, but few great dramas,
according to Dr. Franco Bruno-
Averardi, well-known Italian schol
ar, who spoke on "Contemporary
Literature in Italy" in the Little
Theatre last night. "This is because
the novel, and especially the drama,
require a connection with reality,
which does not exist in Italy," Dr.
Averardi explained.
The first phase of modern Italian
literature is characterized by lyrical
poetry. D'Annunzio and Pascoli are
the two great representative figures
of this period.
D'Annunzio, Pascoli
"One of the great qualities of
D'Annunzio is a fiery imagination
which longs to express itself imme
diately," feaid Dr. Averardi. "The
first period of his poetry shows a
refined and at the same time a pas
sionate tendency to enjoy life. His
great contribution to Italian litera
ture is appreciation of the beauty
of life. The Italian language became
like a wonderful, soft, shiny instru
ment in his hands.
"From Pascoli we get the fresh
vision of nature. He gives the voice
of nature to poetry as no other Ital
ian poet does. His voice is not the
loud voice of praise, but the subdued
one of prayer.
Futurism Movement
"At the beginning of our century
a new movement called futurism
broke out. The futurists rebelled
against the Italian tradition. They
broke all ties of yesterday and
found themselves in a position of
not knowing what to do. This ac
counts for the introspective charac
ter of the second phase of contem
porary Italian literature, which is
characterized by psychology and
philosophy."
Pirandello is one of the chief rep
resentatives of this period, accord
ing to Dr. Averardi. His greatness
consists in his capacity to express
the same situation in many ways.
His subtle psychology has contri
buted much to modern literature.
"Modern Italian writers have been
profoundly influenced by the works
of Pirandello," Dr. Averardi con
cluded.
