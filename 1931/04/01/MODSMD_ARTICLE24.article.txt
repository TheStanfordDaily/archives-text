# ROCKNE'S RITES DELAYED UNTIL WIFE'S RETURN
## Requiem Mass To Be Held At South Bend Early This Morning NOTRE DAME SHOCKED "Knute Greatest Figure In Football"—Warner 
### 
SOUTH BEND, Ind., March 31. (/P)
—Funeral services for Knute Ken
neth Rockne, Notre Dame's football
genius, will be held Saturday or
Monday, definite arrangements
awaiting the arrival of Mrs. Rockne
from Coral Gables, Florida. Classes
will be dismissed, announced Rt.
Rev. Charles L. O'Donnell, president
of the university, for a requiem
mass tomorrow morning.

All Notre Dame and South Bend
stood dazed and benumbed tonight—
still scarcely able to realize the
tragic death that had taken the
famed football coach from them.
Rockne, with seven others, was
killed shortly before 11 o'clock this
morning when a Transcontinental
and Western Air Express liner
crashed on a farm near Bazaar,
Kansas, 30 miles from Kansas Ciiy.
I Rockne was on his way to Holly-
I wood on business.
Plane Lost Wing
Although muggy weather made
flying conditions hazardous, the 10-
passenger Fokker air liner took oil'
| at 9:15 from Kansas City bound for
1 southern California. Latest accounts
deny the report that the plane ex
ploded in mid-air, but that the
crash was caused when the plane
lost a wing and hurtled to the
ground like a crippled bird, burying
one of its three motors deep into
the earth.
Reports of Rockne's death spread
so rapidly here that telephonic com
munication was virtually paralyzed
in local newspaper offices and at
the university. Flags were lowered
I to halfstaff by Mayor W. R. Hinkle
to remain so until after the funeral.
Coaches Accompany Body
Father O'Donnell named "Hunk"
Anderson, end in 1921, and Jack
Chevigny, backfield man of 1928,
1 both of them assistant coaches now,
! to lead a delegation from the uni
; versity to bring back the body.
The death of Knute Rockne, strik
ing the sports world in general and
the football ranks in particular like
a thunderbolt, came as the famous
| coach's career was at its very peak.
Only just passed his forty-third
birthday, the "Rock" of Notre Dame
I had sent his last two football teams
through unbeaten seasons to nation
i al championships, climaxed by the
i sensational victory of his 1930 eleven
over Southern California at Los An
geles last December.
Meteoric Career
Rockne's career, especially in the
last half-dozen years, had been me
! teoric. In constant demand as an
! after-dinner speaker, as a radio
talker, as a syndicate and magazine
I writer, as an adviser to colleges
! seeking the establishment of his
| football methods, Rockne's activities
outside of Notre Dame were of
| amazing proportions.
It was two years ago that a log
infection, aggravated by his insist
j ence upon keeping active, forced
Rockne to his bed. He was on the
side-lines for less than half the
games during the 1929 season but
his team, under the guidance of as-
I sistants, had an undefeated season—
: "fighting for Rock."

neth Rockne, Notre Dame's football
genius, will be held Saturday or
Monday, definite arrangements
awaiting the arrival of Mrs. Rockne
from Coral Gables, Florida. Classes
will be dismissed, announced Rt.
Rev. Charles L. O'Donnell, president
of the university, for a requiem
mass tomorrow morning.

All Notre Dame and South Bend
stood dazed and benumbed tonight—
still scarcely able to realize the
tragic death that had taken the
famed football coach from them.
Rockne, with seven others, was
killed shortly before 11 o'clock this
morning when a Transcontinental
and Western Air Express liner
crashed on a farm near Bazaar,
Kansas, 30 miles from Kansas Ciiy.
I Rockne was on his way to Holly-
I wood on business.
Plane Lost Wing
Although muggy weather made
flying conditions hazardous, the 10-
passenger Fokker air liner took oil'
| at 9:15 from Kansas City bound for
1 southern California. Latest accounts
deny the report that the plane ex
ploded in mid-air, but that the
crash was caused when the plane
lost a wing and hurtled to the
ground like a crippled bird, burying
one of its three motors deep into
the earth.
Reports of Rockne's death spread
so rapidly here that telephonic com
munication was virtually paralyzed
in local newspaper offices and at
the university. Flags were lowered
I to halfstaff by Mayor W. R. Hinkle
to remain so until after the funeral.
Coaches Accompany Body
Father O'Donnell named "Hunk"
Anderson, end in 1921, and Jack
Chevigny, backfield man of 1928,
1 both of them assistant coaches now,
! to lead a delegation from the uni
; versity to bring back the body.
The death of Knute Rockne, strik
ing the sports world in general and
the football ranks in particular like
a thunderbolt, came as the famous
| coach's career was at its very peak.
Only just passed his forty-third
birthday, the "Rock" of Notre Dame
I had sent his last two football teams
through unbeaten seasons to nation
i al championships, climaxed by the
i sensational victory of his 1930 eleven
over Southern California at Los An
geles last December.
Meteoric Career
Rockne's career, especially in the
last half-dozen years, had been me
! teoric. In constant demand as an
! after-dinner speaker, as a radio
talker, as a syndicate and magazine
I writer, as an adviser to colleges
! seeking the establishment of his
| football methods, Rockne's activities
outside of Notre Dame were of
| amazing proportions.
It was two years ago that a log
infection, aggravated by his insist
j ence upon keeping active, forced
Rockne to his bed. He was on the
side-lines for less than half the
games during the 1929 season but
his team, under the guidance of as-
I sistants, had an undefeated season—
: "fighting for Rock."
