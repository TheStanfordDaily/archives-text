GLENDALE, March 31. (/P)
"Navy Bill" Ingram, coach of Cali
fornia, and Coach Glenn "Pop" War
ner of Stanford stepped smilingly
from an air transport plane here to
day. After leaving the Alameda air
port this morning, they were beam
ing in the hopes of a reunion to
night with their friend Knutc
Rockne.
Smiles froze when they heard tho
news.
"Knute can't be dead! I don't be
lieve it" cried Ingram.
Tears welled in the eyes of the
Stanford mentor.
"He was the greatest figure in
football today," said Warner. "One
man with no enemies. The greatest
friend of all his players, and lie did
a lot more for the game." Then
words failed the Stanford veteran.
"Without doubt Rock was the
greatest figure of intercollegiate ath
letics," stated Ingram, "and his
death is the greatest blow inter
collegiate athletics ever had."
