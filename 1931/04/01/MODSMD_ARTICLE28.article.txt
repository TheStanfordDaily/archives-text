# A MAN HAS GONE

### 
The (Ircalcsl (.loach of them all saw lil lo beckon Knute
K. Hockne lo the sidelines for all lime yesterday, and the
nalion mourns one of ils most colorful and outstanding tig
ures a man whose football wizardry was legend, a man
lo whom full grown men and callow youths alike looked
upon with respectful awe.
The manner of his passing was sudden and terrible,
coining as il did when he was riding the crest of the wave
of glory, but he had already left his own unique mark on
American athletics. Kvcn those who hold thai, since foot;
ball is only a game, Hock lie's contributions lo il were rela
tively unimportant, cannot gainsay the fact that the hun
dreds of youths who found in him coach, friend and father
confessor came away the belter for their contact with the
man.
Stanford joins Noire Dame in expressing its grief for
(lie loss of a man, the like of whom the world can il! afford
lo lose.
