# FOR THE FRATERNITIES
## 
### 
As usual, (lit* month of April brings fraternity rushing
and its attendant blessings and evils. Beginning Monday,
for two weeks campus "Greeks" will seek to impress the
freshmen, and the latter in their Inrn will trv to act like
the "nuggets" they think 11 icy are.
Some of Hie freshmen and some of the fraternities will
be nonchalant about the whole matter, but most of the
principals on both sides of the fence won't know how
they're coining out until pledging day. They'll be worried,
and classes mav suffer a bit. However, when it's all over,
and the brass has been properly distributed, Stanford men
will experience their annual enlightenment and realize that
it's not very important after all.
It's not very important, but sometimes the results are
surprising, and disagreeably so, to the freshmen, especially
as regards fraternity finances. Freshmen are told during
rushing what the "average" house bills are, and the next
autumn they find out, sometimes with an unpleasant shock,
what the real house bills are. Not that fraternity expenses
are unnecessarily high or intentionally concealed, but only
that these expenses aren't always accurately represented to
the prospective rushces.

Last year the fraternities filed with tho Dean of Men
information concerning their house debts, their initiation
fees, chapter dues, and national dues. This information
was available to rushccs and was shown them on request,
with the understanding that it was to be kept strictly con
fidential. This year similar material has not been given
to the dean's office by the Interfraternity Council, the body
which supplied it last year.
Prospective rushees who ever have to think of expenses
have a right to know what it will cost them to be in a fra
ternity, and it is only fair that fraternities provide them
with that information. Probably the best means of fur
nishing rushees with that material is through a confidential
agent such as the Dean of Men's office.
