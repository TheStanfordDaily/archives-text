# THE
						EXPERIMENTAL COLLEGE
## 
### 
The tnivei'sity of Wisconsin's Kxperimental College!
may he abandoned. A faculty committee is now preparing!
a report assessing the value of this educational experiment
begun in 1!J27, and will make a recommendation on its
continuance.
Dr. Alexander MeikleJohn's plan for the Kxperimental
College involves broad training in two civilizations, Amcri- :
can and Athenian, in the freslmian and sophomore years, i
Instruction follows a plan similar to Stanford's independ
ent study plan; students read extensively, write frequent
reports, and discuss their work in conferences with instruc- '
tors.
The aims of this man once dean of Rrown I Diversity
and later president of Amherst College are briefly pre
sented by Professor Kliseo Vivas in the current issue of
the .V<ilion:
"Dr. MeikleJohn's dissatisfaction with the current prac
tice in education springs from his belief that its aims are 1
superficial and inadequate, that it is contented with merely
imparting information to the student in a passive fashion
if the student is unwilling to go himself in search of educa
** | Dr. Meiklcjohn | is one of that dwindling minority!
who still retain a genuine and effective faith in the possi
bilities of democracy. Therefore, contrary to current prac
tice. which unconsciously conceives the aim of education
to be the shaping of men to achieve supine conformity
adaptation is the euphemism used for the process he sees :
Hie need of building citizens capable of accomplishing the '
mutual process of reshaping themselves and the environ
ment, a process which alone can make for intelligent and |
successful living in a democracy."
Any action taken in regard to the Kxperimental College
will be watched with keen interest by American educators
and college students, for the College's program under Dr.
Alexander Meiklcjohn has been a radical departure from
the traditional system of American collegiate education.
