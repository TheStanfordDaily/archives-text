# BULL SESSION

### 
One is loathe to touch matters
: that are dead or half-dead. First,
because the odor surrounding such
objects is not pleasant, and second,
because one fears that they will
| crumble and vanish into nothing
ness when their half-decayed frail
ty is exposed to the virility of the
! fresh air.
Such an object is the "Hello
Spirit"— once active, still later
fought for as something worthwhile,
and now relegated to the status of
i the living dead. It is quite easy to
| say "no post mortems," "Jet the body
I lie," or "let the dead sleep in peace."'
If the "Hello Spirit" were fully dead,
I it might be wise to let it rest in
j peace; but the fact that it is living
J in "pieces" is disturbing.
The fact that one still meets a
j "son of the Stanford red" who has
| not turned a boudoir pink awakens
lin one the faint hope that the
! "Hello Spirit" may once more live
: as of yore. The question is at once
| raised: whether it pays to save or
! revive this hoary custom. Many
| claim it is a relic of the days when
| Stanford was a "Farm" in the true
j sense of the word—that is, before
I the days when the campus degener
j ated into a place to spend the five
i days between weekends. Granted
that it is a relic, it is very possible
j that it is a relic worth saving.
! The actual practice of saying
j "Hello" to every Stanford student
| that one meets on the campus really
has more value than nnyiy Vanity
I Fair sophisticates are willing to
j grant it. In the first place, it creates
I a spirit of comradeship that is posi-
I tively enjoyable. We still remember
how our first two hours on the
! Farm were pleasingly punctured by
I

a deep "Hello" from two lettermen.
The second value (♦vhich far ex
ceeds the first) is the breeding of a
spirit of democracy.
Without a democratic spirit, the
Stanford rough becomes a mon
strosity and the primitive atmos
phere of Encina becomes a disgrace
in this age of tile bathrooms and
hot water. Saying "Hello" to our
neighbors will seek to hold off the
icy rigidity of Harvardism and all
the Eastern bunk that it implies for
a little while at least.
Probably the greatest single ob
stacle to the "Hello Custom" (which
i:; fast changing from a custom to a
tradition) is the presence of 500
women. One is hesitant at saying
"Hello" to a "strange" co-ed, not
only because one feels somewhat
like that Hollywood creature, the
masher, but because the unfortunate
male is very likely to receive a
haughty "pass up."
The value of the tradition under
consideration is fairly evident; its
success is still possible. Its revitali
zation does not need any resolu
tions or placards; its success can be
assured by the friendly co-operation
of the "500" by taking the initiative
in voicing the "Hello" to passing
roughs—known or unknown; its fur
ther and more thorough success de
pends on the 3,000 men.
Despite this soul-inspiring plea
for an excellent custom, in all prob
ability it will soon pass the way of
all customs. If, on the other hand,
the "Hello Spirit" is so far dead
that it has become a farce, then let
us pass a law declaring it a farce
and fine everybody $2 for indulging
in this custom. Its lingering death
can not be tolerated further.
