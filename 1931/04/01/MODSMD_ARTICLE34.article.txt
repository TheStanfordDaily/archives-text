ELMER THE GREAT. At the Al- '
cazar Theatre.
j No better choice could have been
I made lor the re-opening of the Al- ;
I cazar than Ring Lardner's play, with
Joe E. Brown as Elmer. Joe is, of
! course, the whole play all by him
self, just as Elmer was the whole
baseball team that won the pennant, j
In addition to baseball, gambling ;
and crooked betting allow Elmer to
1 out-smart the crooks in a "straight"
! way. Unfortunately, that bit of El
i mer's cleverness is poorly empha
| sized. But then, one goes to see Joe
! E. Brown, and as long as the girl j
he loves is allowed to make up his |
I mind for him in the end, previous j
j details are not so important. —J. N. |

TWO HEARTS IN WALTZ TIME. '
At the Columbia Theatre.
Imported from Germany, this i
screen operetta demonstrates un-
Hollywoodian, simplicity, in that it
isn't crammed full of panoramic
views, squirming females, and the •
| usual unnecessary claptrap which j
! the movie moguls find indispensable.
The music is undistinguished and
humble; the cast is good; the story
i moderately sane.
The picture, while not a classic, is
delightfully different, a relief from
| the absurd ostentation which, how
i ever dazzling, becomes tiresome in
| leather short order. —J. S. S.
