i The Editor, Sir:
i Reviewing "Easy for Zee Zee," J. E.
| writes: "While some of the lines are
frankly 'raw' and Zee Zee's costume
j is rather sketchy, the tiling is, all in
! all, not at all offensive, but unusual-
I Iy amusing."
I had the misfortune to see the
play. In my life I have seen plays of
' many kinds in America, in Asia, in
Europe. The dirtiest, the most por-

I I
I nographic, senseless, insipid is "Easy j
for Zee Zee."
i The midget "theatre"—a barn
decoratcd with filthy pictures drawn
by a perverted amateur painter—
! sure helps '"in putting the play
j over." In this the reviewer is right.
"Amusing" is only one thing: how
a mentally sane person could like
; this rotten play and write a favor
able review of it is hard to under-
I stand. —M. J. Tomlin.
