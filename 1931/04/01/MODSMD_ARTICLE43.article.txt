Along in the first week of
spring quarter when the colle
giate coast conference baseball
scramble is at its height and the
first important meets of the
track season are coming along,
minor sports enter the limelight
tor just one weekend and then
drop back into the shade for an
other year. The carnival is
to be held in the bay region Fri
day and Saturday, with Cali
fornia and Stanford as hosts to
L.S.C, and U.C.L.A.

In spite of the high caliber of In
ian minor sports teams, fans on
he Farm seem to have adopted an
(different attitude toward every
hing but football and track. Why
lis should be is a mystery, when
ne stops to consider that Cardinal
wimming, golf, fencing, and boxing
•amp are at the top of the coast

Tn the golf tournament Friday
and Saturday over the difficult
18 holes which comprise the lo
cal layout, the Indians should
have it all their own way against
the best talent that the other
California schools can offer.
Fencing will be staffed here on
the same dates, while Maloney
is sending Captain Fred John
son, middleweight, Fred Glover,
featherweight, and Gordon Gil
bert, light-heavy, to Oakland
Auditorium for the boxing fes
tivities.

Followers of the resin sport are
sappointed that Dick Miller is not
>ing to compete, but the other
reo boys should be able to take
re of themselves, especially John
n and Glover. Miller chose not to
iter the bouts, for he is not overly
nd of the game. Too bad, sincc
is a welter for any college fighter
fear. The result of swimming
mpetition between the four insti
tions is a foregone conclusion,
ice ihe Indians have already de
nted U.S.C. and California and
ould repeat with ease. The mer
en will tangle in Encina pool on
oril 10 and 11.
Injuries again hit the Cardinal
track squad, this time taking
Art Zuger out of the javelin
just when it looked as though
at last Dink had found a point-
Setting pair for this event. Zu
ger strained his back muscles in
Monday's practice, and has been
in the hospital. It is probable
that he will not he able to com
pete for a month, which will
leave A! Ray to carry the bur
[<■ll.
It's not too pleasant for a coach
see a 24 ft. 7 in. broad jumper
f to his team for the season, and
'ii have to stand by helpless while
d Man Injury takes the toll of a
sprinter and a 196 ft. javelin
scr. For that is the sad story of
•nie West, Jimmy Howell, and
ger. Howell should be back in
s than a month, however. Another
ih star. Ralph Giberson, has been
npered all year with a pulled
iscle, but seems to be all right
*v except that he's lost some of
speed.
Johnny Parker and A1 Storms,
listance men, complete the list
vhich injuries have singled out
his season, though both of them
re supposed to he in shape
igain. The former showed up
his quarter after a long layoff
yhich has slowed him plenty, j
.bile Storms has been afflicted
-ith various and sundry ill
esses off and on all year. For i
his reason he has fallen far
hort of (he stellar season in the
lile that was predicted for him
arly in the year.

'rue to form. Coach Robert L. is j
ng not a little experimenting out '
re on the Old Oval. Monday saw |
n Eastman, 880 man, running tl*e ;
t mile of his life in 4:38.0, a time j
ich many an athlete has failed '
equal after practicing that dis- ]
ce for years. Now comes the |

news that Dink might shift Les
Hables to the 440. Everyone would
hate to see him abandon the sprints,
but then he might very possibly de
velop into one of the world's best
in the one-lap event. He can run it
in 48.6 most any afternoon!
That the Indian coach will
shift Ben Eastman to the 880,
more or less of a rumor all year,"
seems now a certainty since the
startling performance of 1:52.6
that the blond sophomore ran in
yesterday's practice. It has been
a long time since 1:53 has been
bettered here on the coast. In
fact Bill Richardson, Stanford's
super two-lappcr of 1927, is the
only coast man* we can recall
who ever ran a 1:52.8 half mile!
