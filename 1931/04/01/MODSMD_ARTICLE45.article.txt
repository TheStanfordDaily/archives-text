# CARD NINE'S HOPES FOR TITLE RISE AS U.C., U.S.C. LOSE IN CONFERENCE TILTS
## 
### 
The hoped for miracle occurred
when both California and Southern
California were defeated yesterday
in Pacific Coast Conference baseball
games. California was trounced by
the raring Broncos from Santa Clara
to the refrain of 9-3, while U.S.C.
was lambasted by the supposedly
down and out Gaels from Moraga
by a 5-2 margin. The race for the
title is certainly tightening up.
Yesterday's results have made the
two games which Stanford plays on
Friday and Saturday doubly im
portant, as a victory in both would
put the Redshirts back on the top
of the heap in the conference stand
ings with the Bears having already
two defeats and the Trojans three
on the lost side of the column.
Card Diamond Best
Showing renewed vigor on getting
back on their own diamond, the
Stanford nine buckled down to
practice with a good show of spirit.

1 To defeat California is the general {
j determination of the squad when [
i they meet the Bears at Berkeley on 1
April 4.
So far, in the wanderings of the j
Indians hither and yon, they have !
failed to find a diamond which
comes anywhere near the excellence !
of the Farm's ball park. Both the '
southern fields are used for almost j
everything else besides baseball and i
are handicapped accordingly.
Team in Good Condition
The heavy artillery on the Card
! squad, Philippi and Rintala, seemed ;
to have their batting eyes well un
! der control. There were no injuries |
suffered by the squad on the south- 1
ern division and the Redshirts j
j should meet California in the best
possible condition.
Because some of the scribes, who
attended Stanford baseball games in ;
the new park, complained of the !
danger to their valuable persons
from foul balls which skimmed over â€¢
the top of the wire netting, an extra |
four feet of screening was added to
the top of the backstop. '
