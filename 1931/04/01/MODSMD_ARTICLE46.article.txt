# Eastman Comes Close to Record in Half-Mile
## TEMPLETON WILL RUN BLOND FLASH IN BOTH 880, 440 Will Run Regular Events In Big Meet In Try For Relay Mark 
### Lowell Cox 
: Dink Templeton has another
U.S.C. meet event in the bag.
Switching Ben Eastman from his
| favorite quarter-mile event, Temple
j ton yesterday afternoon sent the
crack blond runner over the half
; mile route, with the result that Easl
i man negotiated the distance in one
! minute, 52.6 seconds, just one sec
i ond slower than the world record.
No collegiate runner on the Pacific
t Coast can touch that mark, which
â–  | is the fastest time ever made in the
[ West. The world mark, 1:51.6, was
set by the German ace, Otto Peltzer.
Should Beat McGeah
Bill McGeah of U.S.C., who trav
; els the two laps in 1:56, has been
I regarded as the probable winner of
the half-mile when the Indians and
the Trojans clash May 2, but East
man's startling performance yester
day indicates that Templeton has
uncovered another first-place win
' lier.
One of the most encouraging as
! pects of Eastman's race yesterday
| was the fact that he appeared fi'esh
1 soon after the race. Since he would
; be a cinch to take first in the 440,
j indications are that he will be able
1 to run both races v
Overcomes) Handicap
The blond flash thrilled a handful i
of track followers who were watch- '
ing practice at the Stadium yester- j
day afternoon. After giving Fullen- 1
wider a 15-yard handicap, Eastman \
I caught him on the back stretch of
the final lap, leading him to the '
tape by another 15 yards.
Just how soon Templeton will use I
i Eastman in his new-found event is j
I problematical. He will confine his 1
I efforts to the 440 and the relay in I
| tiie Los Angeles Athletic Club meet i
in the South Saturday.
To Run Relay
As- for the California meet, Tem
pleton indicated last night that he ;
! may use Eastman in his regular j
; events at that time also, in an effort !
: to crack the meet record in the mile j
' relay.
