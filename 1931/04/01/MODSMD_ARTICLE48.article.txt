# JOHNSON, GLOVER, GILBERT ARE INDIAN MITTMEN FOR MINOR SPORTS MATCHES
## 
### Tom Pockman 
Boxers to represent the Indians in.
! the coming Minor Sports matches
j scheduled for Friday and Saturday,
| April 3 and 4, at the Oakland Muni
-1 cipal Auditorium, have been se-
I lected by Boxing Coach Harry Ma
j loney.
Captain Fred Johnson, middle
weight, Captain-elect Fred Glover,
: featherweight, and Gordon Gilbert,
j light-heavy, will wear the cardinal
and white in the Oakland ring Fri
\ day. These men are the best in their
j weights here and should go far in
| the tourney.
Captain Johnson has won consist
, ently all season, only dropping one
I close four-round decision in the
j second California encounter. Glover
has won all of his matches this sea
son by either one- or two-round
knockouts, and should come out on
top in his class. Gilbert is the Uni
versity champion in his class and
has shown rapid improvement
throughout the year. In the second
California battle Gilbert handily j
outpointed his Berkeley opponent. '
Local boxers will find most of '
their stiff competition in the Cali
fornia entrants who now hold one
decision over the Cardinals. Strong
teams are also being entered by St.
Mary's, California Aggies, and San

. I Francisco University.
; The strength of the other Coast
conference members in this sport is
not well known. However, both
U S.C. and U.C.L.A. can be counted
on to have several good mitt-swing
| ers in the meet.
Coach Moloney's three stars are
working out daily now under the
watchful eye of the veteran instruc
tor, and should all go a long way
in the matches Friday and Satur
day.
