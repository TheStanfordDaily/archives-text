# BABE TRACKSTERS FACE TOUGH MEET WITH STATE TEAM
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track team, j
I which has on occasion shown un- '
expected strength to compile a fine j
I season's record, faces strong opposi- i
! tion in their meet with San Jose !
State in the Old Oval next Satur- !
day, says Coach Bill Ellington.
Being a four-year school, San Jose j
has a chance to develop and train i
their men, whicli the frosh lack. In j
the distance runs, particularly, they
j should be strong.
To judge from past performances,
lack of practice should not bother
i Dave Packard, versatile freshman
luminary. He was the one who
, changed his basketball uniform for
i a track suit and with one day's
| practice won firsts in the broad
, jump and high hurdles in the all-
J star meet.
! Since then he has added the high
hurdles to his repertoire.
In Charley Stitch of San Jose, for- 1
: mer high-school crack, he faces
| stern opposition. Stitch has cut 25 11
seconds in the low hurdles and np- <
! proached 15 flat in the highs.
