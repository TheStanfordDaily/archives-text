## Scherbakoff Is Prominent Figure In Art Centers Of Many Nations 
### 
An exhibition of over 53 paint
ings and sketches by Sergey Scher
bakoff, Russian artist, opened yes
terday at the Art Gallery and will
continue for a month's period. The
paintings are done in the decorative
manner that has made Scherbakoff
a prominent figure in international
art centers.
In an adjoining room is to be
found a collection of drawings by
Nikolai Nedashkovsky, another Rus
sian artist, and friend of Scherba
koff. The gallery will be open every
day from 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock, and
no admission will be charged.
Scherbakoff was born in Kov
kovka, Russia, in 1894, and is a
graduate of the Academy of Fine
Arts at Kharkov. In 1912 he was
elected a member of the Russian
art society, Boodiak. His water col
ors have been bought by various art
galleries in Russia, by the museum
of the city of Kharkov, and by the
university there.

After the world war, he went to
Manchuria and later to Japan where
he spent four years in the Bonin
islands with his friends, the Russian
painters Alexander Yakovleff and
Nikolai Nedashovsky. It was there
that his principal paintings were
completed. The semi-oriental note
of his work is one of the main
sources of its charm, critics agree.

In 1920 his paintings were ex
hibited by the Imperial Japanese
Art Association. They have been
purchased for the private gallery
of Prince Utnisan, and for members
of the Japanese imperial family.
