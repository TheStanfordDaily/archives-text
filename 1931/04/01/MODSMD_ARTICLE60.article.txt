# U.C.L.A. NET TEAM TO MEET STANFORD ON CAMPUS FRIDAY
## 
### 
Led by Elbert Lewis, Pacific Coast
Conference singles champion, the
U.C.L.A. net team will make a final
I effort to even the score with the
i Cardinals on the local courts Friday.

Out to avenge their defeat last
week in the South, the Bruins will
| put forth all their strength to down
| Stanford's classy netsters. It is prob
, able that Cliff Robbins, Bruin sec
ond man, will add his presence to
! the melee, and, combined with the
improved condition of Lev/is, the
visitors should be able to make a

j considerably larger dent in the In
( dians than in the opening match.
The feature match of the day, of
; course, will come with the Gledhill
| Lewis struggle, although the dou
| bles encounters will probably hold
! the honors for flash and speed. The
i same men, Gledhill, Captain Ted
j Easton, Harry Plymire, Joe Cough
j lin, Trow Stephens, Phil Niederauer,
; and Wilbur Cox, are expected to
stem the tide Friday afternoon.
