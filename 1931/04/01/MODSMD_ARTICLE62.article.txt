The scholarship average of the
"500" was "as usual" higher than
the men's last year, according to
Dean Yost's report in the annual
President's Report, and the average

In the statistics compiled in the
report to show the average stand
ing of men and women in the Uni
versity the average ratio of the Uni
versity (1.55) is taken as zero, and
the. range from this figure to the
highest possible ratio (3.00) is di
vided into ten equal parts, num
bered from plus 1 to plus 10, plus 1
being the first above the University

Under this system the average
grade point per unit for women is
plus 2 and for men minus 1. Non
