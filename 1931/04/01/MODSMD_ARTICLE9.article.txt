# SPRING CHAPPIE TO FETE HUMOR SOCIETY'S BIRTH
## 
### 
rHAPPIE will blossom forth
011 April 1(> in new spring
garb and in celebration of the
25th anniversary of the found
ing of Hammer and CofTin So
ciety.
The Old Boy reveals the fact
that this society for the propa
gation of loud, hearty, and
health-giving laughter was
founded not more than two
hours before the great earth
quake which razed San Fran
cisco to the ground and ruined
many of the campus buildings,
but refuses to state whether
there is any connection be
tween the two events.
Although there will be many
contributions from oldtimers,
there is still room and time
for student contributions on the
usual spring subjects of foot
ball, "rushing," water sports or
the lack of them, and other
vernal and laugh-provoking
material.
