# R. G. GETTELL SAYS LEAGUE BECOMING AN EUROPEAN BODY
## 
### 
Two important changes in the
| League of Nations are its evolution
I into an European rather than a
j world-wide league, the loss of its
i impartial and cosmopolitan point of
' view, according to Professor R. G.
I Gettell of the political science de
-1 partment of the University of Cali
j fornia, who spoke at the Palo Alto
] Woman's Club House last night.
No fundamental questions have
j been submitted to the League, be
! cause they cannot be settled satis
| factorily without the United States,
i and because the larger powers are
| not willing to allow the smaller
powers,'who have a majority in the
League, to settle them.
Professor Gettell devoted the sec
ond half of the hour to-a discussion
of Bolshevism and Fascism, results
of the World War. The two move
ments are diametrically opposed,
but have many of the same results.
