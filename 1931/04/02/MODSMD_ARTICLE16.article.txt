# AFRICAN CANNIBALS SCORN WHITE MEAT
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 1.
liam B. Seabrook, American author,
has sampled the diet of Africa's
cannibals. There is not eating of
missionaries, the writer said, partly
because there arc no missionaries
in that territory.
Mon-Po, a cannibal chief, told
Seabrook he had not tasted white
meat for nearly 20 years. He said
that "It was no better than the meat
of the black man" and as "The
whites had always been too difficult
to catch" it really wasn't worth the
bother.
