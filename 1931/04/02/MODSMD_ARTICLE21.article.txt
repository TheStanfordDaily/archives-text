# Farm Smoke-Eaters Fite Fire With Gasoline Pump
## 
### 
Putting out campus fires with
gasoline is one of various practices
introduced by the advent of the
horseless carriage at Stanford. This
results not from the experiments of
local chemistry majors, but from
early establishment of the campus
gas station next to the fire house.
Station attendants play a doub'o
role. Ever alert, they can, at the
drop of a hat, don rubber boot 3 over
. their white coveralls, throw aside
] the tire gauge for the fire axe and
the gas hose for the Pyrene pump.
Other salient facts disclosed were:
more gas is sold in spring than
any other quarter, which substanti
ates the old theory of . in the
1 spring a young man's fancy"—and
proves the several brands of no-nox
as the best antidote for spring fever.

| "Five gallons" is the most common
: request. 4
Also—that women buy gas in
greater quantities than men; women
run out of gas of tenor than men;
I and women rarely have to trudge
afoot to the station after gas, which
: shows that chivalry still flickers,
even in this day of impersonalities.
Tiie humble gas house is m>t un
\ touched by the mighty. Hoover, Wil
bur, and ex-Governor C. C. Young
have been every-day patrons. The
firfc trucks are star customers. The
glass-panelled walls prove a favor
j ite rendezvous for the st.ong arm
| of the law, and the local Sherlock
Holmes, as evidenced by the famil
iarly parked cars of Gordon Davis,
campus traffic officer, and George
| Burns, chief detective.
