# DANGER SEEN BY HACKETT IN J.C. MOVE
## National Greek Officer Is Speaker At Meeting Of Row Moguls 
### 
Junior colleges were given a verb
j al beating last night at the meeting
! of the Interfraternity Council, when
' Norman Hackett, nai ionnl graduate
1 secretary of Theta Delta Chi and
representative of the National In
terfraternity Conference, discussed
some of the problems facing frater-
I nities in colleges all over the coun
; try-
Hackett expressed himself as
! "frankly worried at the trends in
educational reorganization" and de
clared that the establishment of
four-year colleges at Sacramento,
. Fresno, and San Diego would seri
ously injure the standards at Stan
j ford and at the University of Cali
fornia.
Co-operation in the realization of
i common ideals and a common cause
was cited the most important need
I of the fraternities today, and it is i.o
| that end that the interfraternity
1 conference was organized in New
York, composed of representatives of
I 65 national fraternities.
Quoting Ray Lyman Wilbur,
| president-on-leave of Stanford, who
was a principal speaker at the meet
ing of the conference last year,
Hackett said, "President Wilbur de
clared that he was not a fraternity
i man, but that he had been observ
-1 ing fraternities for a number of
I years, and that he was convinced
that fraternities filled a definite need
in college life or they would not
I have endured for more than a hun
; dred years."
i At the meeting rushing cards for
the first period were distributed by
! Richard Grant, and instructions for
â–  the conduct of rushing were given.
| The first period begins on April G
1 and lasts until April 16.
