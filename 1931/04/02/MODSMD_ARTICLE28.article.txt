# CANAL SURVEY NOT HINDERED BY QUAKE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 1. (/Piâ€”ll
was said on high authority at the
War Department today that the
army survey for the proposed At
lantic-Paeific canal through Nica
ragua will be completed as expedi
tiously as possible despite the earth
quake at Managua.
The attitude of Army officials was
that the earthquake should not stand
in the way of completing the sur
vey, which now is in its final stages.
The future policy on whether the
canal should be constructed is de
pendent upon the nature of the re
port, it was said.
