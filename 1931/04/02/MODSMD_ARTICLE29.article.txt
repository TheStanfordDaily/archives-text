# FAMOUS MILER SEES EASTMAN RUN GREAT 440
## Sophomore Flash Clocked At 48: 1 For One Lap Handicap Race MARTIN ON U. S. TOUR "Flying Surgeon" Is Most Versatile Runner 
### Stewart Crawford 
Dr. Paul Martin, the speedy sur
geon from Switzerland, worked out
in the Stadium yesterday afternoon
with Dink Templeton's runners, but
Ben "Bangs" Eastman stole the show.
After being shown about the cam
pus earlier in the day by the Indian
coach, Martin, holder of middle dis
tance records won in national and
world meets from Canada to Ger
many, showed his appreciation by
putting on a suit and running a dead
heat exhibition mile with Bob Brown
in the respectable time of 4:31.
Watches Eastman
It was then that Dink brought out
the blond sophomore flash, who star
tled track circles with a 1:52.G half
mile Tuesday, to show the famous
doctor something about the Stanford
track team.
Running three quarters of the one
lap race behind Shove, who had been
given a 12-yard handicap, Eastman
closed up the gap on the last turn
and passed his teammate on the
straightaway to break the tape in
48.1, the fastest 440 he has ever run.
Ben Threatens Record
The sophomore flash has been do
ing 48.4 consistently since the inter
class meet early in the season, and
this new mark seems to bear out the
prediction that before the spiked
shoes are put away next summer
Eastman will improve another sec
ond to better Ted Meredith's world
mark of 47.4.
Though his performance was over
shadowed by Eastman's sensational
time. Dr. Martin's visit was a treat
to fans on the Farm. He is the most
versatile athlete in (he world today,
since his activities range from run
ning in close to world's record time
to performing difficult in
bone surgery.

The "Flying Surgeon," in this
country on a world survey of health
education for the International Red
Cross Society, recently ran a mile in
the Trojan-Olympic Club meec down
routh, to finish right behind Carter,
Winged "O" star, while the latter was
stopping the watches in 4.17.

Martin has had 15 years of track
competition, and is still going strong,
for he plans to enter (he Olympic
Games at Los Angeles next year. As
on expert skier, ice skating cham
pion, linguist in four languages, lec
turer and writer on hygiene and
physical culture, the doclcv has had
q;'ite a busy American tour.
Also, he is an inventor of some
note. Going Paavo Nurmi and his
wrist-watch timer one better, he has
invented a contraption that acts as
a pacer. If a iniler would like to do
4:15, he sets the gadget at the de
fired mark, puts it on the track and
keeps in step, if he can. The in
vention is rather heavy, says the
doctor, arid is not pcrfect as yet, but
he will bring it with him to the
Olympic Games.

wrist-watch timer one better, he has
invented a contraption that acts as
a pacer. If a iniler would like to do
4:15, he sets the gadget at the de
fired mark, puts it on the track and
keeps in step, if he can. The in

he will bring it with him to the
Olympic Games.
Dr. Paul Martin, the speedy sur
geon from Switzerland, worked out
in the Stadium yesterday afternoon
with Dink Templeton's runners, but
Ben "Bangs" Eastman stole the show.
After being shown about the cam
pus earlier in the day by the Indian
coach, Martin, holder of middle dis
tance records won in national and
world meets from Canada to Ger
many, showed his appreciation by
putting on a suit and running a dead
heat exhibition mile with Bob Brown
in the respectable time of 4:31.

It was then that Dink brought out
the blond sophomore flash, who star
tled track circles with a 1:52.G half
mile Tuesday, to show the famous
doctor something about the Stanford
track team.
Running three quarters of the one
lap race behind Shove, who had been
given a 12-yard handicap, Eastman
closed up the gap on the last turn
and passed his teammate on the
straightaway to break the tape in
48.1, the fastest 440 he has ever run.
Ben Threatens Record
The sophomore flash has been do
ing 48.4 consistently since the inter
class meet early in the season, and
this new mark seems to bear out the
prediction that before the spiked
shoes are put away next summer
Eastman will improve another sec
ond to better Ted Meredith's world
mark of 47.4.
Though his performance was over
shadowed by Eastman's sensational
time. Dr. Martin's visit was a treat
to fans on the Farm. He is the most
versatile athlete in (he world today,
since his activities range from run
ning in close to world's record time
to performing difficult in
bone surgery.

The "Flying Surgeon," in this

education for the International Red
Cross Society, recently ran a mile in
the Trojan-Olympic Club meec down
routh, to finish right behind Carter,
Winged "O" star, while the latter was
stopping the watches in 4.17.

Martin has had 15 years of track
competition, and is still going strong,
for he plans to enter (he Olympic
Games at Los Angeles next year. As
on expert skier, ice skating cham
