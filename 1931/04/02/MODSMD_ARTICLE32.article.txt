The Omaha World-Herald protests vigorously edito
rially against tlie state-wide moaning and tearing of hair

of the state legislators to their feet with veiled threats of
reduced appropriations for the university unless drastic
action was taken immediately.
The World-Herald is right. The university's board of

orators scream for their blood.
