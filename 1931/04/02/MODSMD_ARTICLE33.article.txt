While American educators are awaiting with interest
the forthcoming faculty committee report at the University
of Wisconsin on the success of Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn's
Experimental College, oilier collegiate educational ventures
are attracting attention.

The rniversity of Chicago has a new plan whereby Presi
dent Robert Hutehins hopes lo make actual knowledge
rather than length of attendance the basis for the awarding
of degrees. At Vale, students are looking forward to the
inception next fall of a system whereby the only examina
tions will be comprehensive ones given at the end of the
year, over courses covering a full years work.
And now the announcement comes from Minnesota Ityat
all seniors in the College of Science, Literature, and the Arts
will be given a comprehensive examination covering sub
jects of gene ral culture. This is to be part of a series of
educational reforms 011 the Minneapolis campus, the aim
being to direct students" effort in cultivating their ability to
get the most from their individual mental equipment, rather
than merely lo secure a diploma.
Kach of these moves has the same basic idea: lo make
the university years a more valuable educational experi
ence, instead of simply a period of time the "four-year
loaf" preparatory lo a degree sought only for its prestige
value.
