# YOUNGER GENERATION SCORES
## 
### 
College journalism and college thinking come in for a
word of approbation in the April 1 issue of Oswald Garrison
Villard's Nation. The Haruard Crimson not long ago pro
tested sharply against a proposal to build a great new chapel
as a war memorial on the Cambridge campus. The Nan
York 'l imes ridiculed the protest, saving, "Some of the chil
dren are bawling in the college papers . . ."
Now the Nation replies with a gratifying defense of the
Crimson's stand. "The honors, in our judgment," declares
the Nation, "rest with the younger generation. The grounds
of objection to the proposed memorial actually set forth bv
both the editors and the contributors of the C.rimsoii seem
to us evidence of a sound and serious concern with a ques
tion of real educational interest, and we congratulate Ihem
on their protest.
"These protesting young men, if we understand them,
are not objecting to religion as such, however much they
may be questioning some of its current manifestations.
They do seem lo object, however, lo the assumption that
God is Nordic, Protestant, capitalistic, and pro-Ally. And
they do not believe that the universities have the right to
use the millions they can so easily command for the uncriti
cal propagation of accepted ideas and beliefs. The students
seem to be doing honest and genuine thinking, and in their
thought we see far more of hope bolh for the universities
and for the religion of the future than we can see in the
action of a corporation that would build an unnceded
chapel in the midst of a living university, or in the ideas of
a great newspaper that finds it possible lo defend such a
waste provided only thai the proposed building is 'beauti
ful'."
The Nation's stand is well taken. So many and so urgent
are its needs that education has 110 funds lo squander in an
attempt to sanctify a war, more especially the recent one,
through the association of two such dissimilar institutions
as religion and war.
