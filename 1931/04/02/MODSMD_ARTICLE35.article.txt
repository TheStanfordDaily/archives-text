# BULL SESSION

In honesty and not in self-defense,
we confess that v/e have never seen
"Easy for Zee Zee." We have, how
ever, lived* in Encina for one year
which is almost tantamount to hav
ing seen the production. We have
heard described the raciest scenes;
and if (here is any filth in the play,
we no doubt have heard it.
There is considerable doubt among
many whether the play is filthy or
not. There is no question, however,
that the play is not a Sunday School
production and that its appeal is
distinctly not to the finer things in
life. Whether the Daily was justified
in reviewing this play favorably or
whether Mr. Tomlin was justified in
casting aspersions on the mental in
tegrity of the reviewer is beyond
our scopc for the present.
The fact that this play, however,
can run for years and then come
back for more, is significant. Every
one knows that sex, the blushing
violet of yesterday, has become the
flaming marigold of today. To say
that the pendulum has swung from
one extreme to the other extreme
is to utter a truism. Where else
could a pendulum swing? If debs,
sub-debs, and dubs desire to make
certain fields of biology a topic of
sophisticated conversation, that is
their business; but when sex is
plastered all over our plays, movies,

! and current literature the matter
| becomes of more general interest. j
We do not favor books of the
i George Eliot stamp wherein a girl
jis insulted when a man sweetly
kisses her hand. If sex is necessary j
!in literature (and it probably is), i
I let it be brought in with the mel- ,
lpwness of an old painting rather
J than with the harshness of the col
| ors of a campaign poster.
And our movies are no better. A
I whole play often revolves around a
I few improper exposures at the
proper moment. A few adolescently
: suggestive remarks make a picture
| sophisticated. The stage is in a simi- j
i lar predicament.
All this does not mean that we
favor censorship. Censorship is not
jonly somewhat stupid but it defeats !
i its own purpose. "Banned in Boston" !
I on a book cover changes a mediocre !
| novel into the nation's best seller. !
And if the local Parents-Teachers j
i Association will condemn a movie, |
its success is assured. In final le- ;
sort, producers can always place a
sign outside, "Unsuited for Civil- j
dren," and be sure of packing the 1
; house.
In short, we claim that while |
linens are necessary and while i
washing them is expedient, there is |
no reason for conducting the laun- j
drying process on the front porch. !

In honesty and not in self-defense,
we confess that v/e have never seen
"Easy for Zee Zee." We have, how
ever, lived* in Encina for one year
which is almost tantamount to hav
ing seen the production. We have
heard described the raciest scenes;
and if (here is any filth in the play,
we no doubt have heard it.
There is considerable doubt among
many whether the play is filthy or
not. There is no question, however,
that the play is not a Sunday School
production and that its appeal is
distinctly not to the finer things in
life. Whether the Daily was justified
in reviewing this play favorably or
whether Mr. Tomlin was justified in
casting aspersions on the mental in
tegrity of the reviewer is beyond
our scopc for the present.
The fact that this play, however,
can run for years and then come
back for more, is significant. Every
one knows that sex, the blushing
violet of yesterday, has become the
flaming marigold of today. To say
that the pendulum has swung from
one extreme to the other extreme
is to utter a truism. Where else
could a pendulum swing? If debs,
sub-debs, and dubs desire to make
certain fields of biology a topic of
sophisticated conversation, that is
their business; but when sex is
