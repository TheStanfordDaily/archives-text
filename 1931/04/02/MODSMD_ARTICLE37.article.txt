THE VINEGAR TREE. By Os
!)orn. Farrar and Rinehart, $2. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)

Augustus Merrick sat under a j
hypothetical vinegar tree until his j
family considered him permanently
soured. If his caustic remarks j
seemed a bit brutal to them, they j
amused Paul Osborn, who makes
this same Augustus the one human j
character in his very successful
foolery, "The Vinegar Tree."
Augustus is an onlooker who !
views the mad if entertainingly ludi- i
crous capers of his family and their I
visitors from an easy chair, save
during those few moments when he
is required to be an irate papa. j
One would hardly care to call the j
comedy superb, even repeat the !
warm phrases which its production j
drew from some usually unwarm
members of the critical profession;
but it does amuse and that, after
all, is the essential factor in comedy.

RANCiO—At the Varsity Theatre.

If you like these pictures of Afri
can home life, Ernest Schoedsack,
the producer of "Chang' and other
films of jungle animals, has made
another very presentable piece of
work. This one is of Sumatra in the
Dutch East Indies, but the effect is
that of Africa, India, the Amazon,
or any other wild and woolly place.
The expressions on the faces of
the monkeys, the fights between
tigers, between a tiger and a buf- j
falo, tigers chasing a young boy
through the jungle, and the antics
of "Rango," the baby orang-uian,
are alternately amusing and thrill- j
ing.
The photography is excellent and
the life of the Sumatra natives, the
life of the jungle animals, and the
workings fo the various traps and
snares are interesting and educa
tional.
Added to that, there is a Laurel j
and Hardy comedy which is good as |
only Laurel and Hardy can do, and j
a Talkitoon comedy. —H. M.

FINN AND HATTIE—At the New
Stanford Theatre.

Donald Ogden Stewart's story j
Hollywoodized but still recognizable 1

| and still side-tickling.
Erol, the man with the rubber
j legs drunk and sober, and Zazu
I Pitts, Ihe humorously wistful trust
| ing wife, work well together in har
ness, but Mitzi Green, Hollywood's
|''cute" little girl, takes all the acting
i honors without a struggle. As usual
lin the "squawkies" the juvenile
! characters prove better than the
majors.
Your sides may not ache after the
! performance but it should not be
| missed if only for the shot v/ith the
i sophisticated taxi driver and street
i cleaner introducing the country
i bred Haddocks to Noo Yawk.
i It would do any world-weary soul
' good to see the odious little Sidney
! hurled into the ocean after a luck
j less and inoffensive duck, and badly
j fooled by the ancient trick of the
i singing gold fish bowl. —S. C. A.
