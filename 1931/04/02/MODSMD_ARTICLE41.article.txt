# TWO TEAMS BATTLE FOR TENNIS RANKING
## 
### 
Battling for third ranking posi- j
tion on the varsity tennis ladder, !
Chuck Weesner and Bob Forbes will !
meet the Nicderauer-Cox combina- j
ation on the varsity courts this af- I
ternoon.
Neiederauer and Cox, who have
had a good bit of experience to- j
gether, traveled South during spring j
vacation to do their part against ,
U.C.L.A. and the Trojans. Although j
they lost both their titles to the op- j
posing aggregations, they are ex- j
pecied to furnish plenty of compe- j
tition for the present third-rankers, j
and perhaps cop the position for
themselves.
