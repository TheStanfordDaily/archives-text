Const sports circles have been
buzzing considerably of late
about the unexpected early sea
son success of Coach Walter
Christie's University of Califor
nia {rack and field team, which
blossomed all at once up there
at Berkeley two weeks ago and
surprised the track world with
tin SI to 50 win over the Olym
pic Club runners.

After suffering the expected ve

AA.C. aggregation last week, the

The Huskies journey South to
:e Christie's men on the California
iderpath Saturday in their third
al meet in as many years, with

• th 6 first time in the course of
• rivalry.

This year the Northerners are
ar from being as strong as they

leveloped some hitherto un

ake a place in the sportlight
lefore the season is over.

Fred Deßerry is the other

betted the sudden rise of Cali
irnia's track prowess, having
jssed the 16-pound sphere out

lese boys go against Washing

t whether the 1931 Blue and

vception in Christie's long list
f disastrous Big Meets.
Jc are pulling for the Berkeley
s, for none of the fans enjoy

ancient rival cf Stanford. Even

this U.C. team will annex a lot

say, it will add interest, at least.
Morse sort of let himself go in
'e columns of the Call-Bulletin
.jesday when he suggested
at a flock of California-Stan
rd meet records would change
om the red to the blue side of
e present unbalanced ledger,
sking for one or two would
ive been bad enough, but
rick just went down the line
i every event in the catalogue.
ot to cast any reflections on Mr.
se, wc realize that he is the most
d of rabid California fans. But
n he goes so far as to suggest
Dink's potential world-beating
y team might drop the baton
le the Bear four, including no
man who is capable of better
i 50 flat, breezed on to a new
t record, we object. Christie's
•tet couldn't better 3:18 on bi
es, whether their opponents
iped the baton cr threw it out
ic Stadium.
Mr. Morse forgot to mention
e other possibilities. Maybe
istman, Hables, Shove, and
jwell will all try to swing in a
inmock some time between

eaks under the strain they
ght all fall to the ground, dead
