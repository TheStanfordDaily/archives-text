# Eighty-Five Turn Out for First Grid Practice
## MANY LETTERMEN RETURN TO RANKS FOR 1931 CAMPAIGN Discovering a Fullback To Occupy Warner During Spring Practice 
### Lowell Cox 
With Coach Pop Warner back
from Los Angeles, spring football
i practice opened on the Farm yes
[ terday.
j Eighty-five gridders were in uni
i form for Ihe opening session, and
j this number is expected to be
swelled to nearly 100 in a few days.
! Forty of those who have turned out
i have had varsity or gray experience,
the remainder being new material
i or from the frosh squad of last year.
Other spring sports are occupying
the attention of several of the var
sity men, including Rintala, Caddel,
and Hardy in baseball, and G. Grey,
N. Gray, McLeod, and Laborde in
track.
Need New Fullbacks
Warner sent the squad through a
brisk two hours of exercise and
fundamentals, but did not hold eith
er signal practice or scrimmage.
The search for a fullback or two
to step into the shoes of Harlow
Rothert and Bill Simkins is ex
pected to be the feature of the
spring session.
While the loss of Guido Caglieri,
who has decided not to return next
fall, will be felt keenly, there is
still plenty of material for every
post except the fullback berth,
which is so. important in the War
ner .system.
Hillman at Quarter
Captain Harry Hillman will of
! course take care of one of the in-
I terchangeable fullback-quarterback
positions, with Phil Baker and
i '"Dusty" Allen for relief work.
But for the other position, ma
! terial fs most conspicuous by its ab
! sence. ft is possible that Warner
I may have to draw on his halfbacks,
j Caddel has had fullback experience,
' but he performed most brilliantly at
I half last season.
Halfbacks Numerous
Considerably brighter is the half
-1 back situation. First there is Phil
| Moffatt, all-American candidate of
last season. To him will probably
fall the principal kicking burden.
| He is greased lightning in the open
! field, and both a tosser and receiver
j of passes.
Rintala and Caddel should be ripe
! for great seasons, while Hardy,
j Lambert, Wilson, and several pros
pects from the grays and frosh will'
I provide plenty of substitutes.
Guido Definitely Out
Caglieri last night quieted rumors
j that he might change his mind
about not returning next fall, stat
ing that he intends to graduate in
June, as he announced some time
ago.
The line, from end to end, should
be at least the equal of last year's.
! Neill and Doub, regulars last year,
| will return to the wing posts. Ehr
i horn and George Grey, substitute
| tackles who performed so well last
j season, should take care of the
i tackle posts in good style, with N.
Gray, Laborde, and others as subs.
;• Heiser Back at Guard
Heiser will be back for another
j season at guard, while the array of
I candidates for the other post in-
I eludes ITulen, Dawson, Hand, Mc
; Leod, Kite, and other excellent pros-
I pects.

Need New Fullbacks
Warner sent the squad through a
brisk two hours of exercise and
fundamentals, but did not hold eith
er signal practice or scrimmage.
The search for a fullback or two
to step into the shoes of Harlow
Rothert and Bill Simkins is ex
pected to be the feature of the
spring session.
While the loss of Guido Caglieri,
who has decided not to return next
fall, will be felt keenly, there is
still plenty of material for every
post except the fullback berth,
which is so. important in the War
ner .system.
Hillman at Quarter
Captain Harry Hillman will of
! course take care of one of the in-
I terchangeable fullback-quarterback
positions, with Phil Baker and
i '"Dusty" Allen for relief work.
But for the other position, ma
! terial fs most conspicuous by its ab
! sence. ft is possible that Warner
I may have to draw on his halfbacks,
j Caddel has had fullback experience,
' but he performed most brilliantly at
I half last season.
Halfbacks Numerous
Considerably brighter is the half
-1 back situation. First there is Phil
| Moffatt, all-American candidate of
last season. To him will probably
fall the principal kicking burden.
| He is greased lightning in the open
! field, and both a tosser and receiver
j of passes.
Rintala and Caddel should be ripe
! for great seasons, while Hardy,
j Lambert, Wilson, and several pros
pects from the grays and frosh will'
I provide plenty of substitutes.
Guido Definitely Out
Caglieri last night quieted rumors
j that he might change his mind
about not returning next fall, stat
ing that he intends to graduate in
June, as he announced some time
ago.
The line, from end to end, should
be at least the equal of last year's.
