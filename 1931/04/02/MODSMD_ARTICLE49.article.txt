With Saturday set for the opening
clash in the annual California-
Stanford yearling baseball series, the
Indian babes are conceded an even
chance to triumph over a strong
California squad. The first game of
the trio will take place at Stanford,
with the Cards journeying to Berke
ley on the two succeeding Satur
days.
The California Cubs have made
an impressive record this season.
Their long string of victories 'is
marred only by defeats at the hands
of San Mateo J.C. and Berkeley
High. The latter was downed in a
return game by a 5 to 3 score.
Records About Even
California can also boast a 13 to 8
win over Menlo Junior College and
a 4 to 3 defeat of Sacramento High.
If comparative scores county for
anything, California took an easy
13 to 1 victory from Polytechnic
High while Stanford won by ap-

'proximately the same score, 13 to 2.
A great deal of the Cardinal
I nine's chances for success against
their traditional opponents will de
pend on the valuable right arm of
Stan Anderson, ace-high chucker.
j Throughout the season he has aver
\ aged close to two strikeouts per in
ning pitched, and runs earned off
of him are negligible. Bob Savinskie
i has been Anderson's only relief
' during the season.
Massey to Receive
Massey behind the plate, Hearn
'at first, Joe Robinson and Holmes
at second, Maentz. short, and Buller
! or Bacon on third, comprise Coach
i Murray Cuddeback's choice for the
. infield jobs.
Goldmann appears to be the only
sure starter in the outfield, with
Pir.ero, Sutrow, and Miles available.
Miles displayed some fancy slug
-1 ging in the Fullerton fracas and may
I get the call over Pinero for right
i field.
