# JOHNSON HOLDS VARSITY MATES TO ONE BINGLE
## Star Hurler Looks Great In Practice; Trojans Here Tomorrow 
### Francis Lloyd 
The same lineup that collected 40
hits in four games during the In
dians' Southern invasion was unable
to get more than one scratch hit
1 over first in three tries when they
j batted against Dan Johnson in prac
! lice yesterday.
The former Hollywood High ace
kept all the Redshirt big sticks si
lent as they watched a fast ball and
then a sharp breaking curve nick
j the corners of the plate. The way
Johnson was going today it will take
more than a former custodian of the
Axe to come out ahead in a pitcli
i ing duel.
Pitching Problem
Who will pitch against Southern
California tomorrow is still one of
| those problems which Harry Woiter
will have to solve. Unless one of
! the many second-string pitchers has
an inspired day it is more than
i likely that at least two chuckers
will toe the rubber for Stanford.
Griffin, the man who pitched the
' Trojans into a win against the
, Cards, was credited with the defeat
| by Saint Mary's on Tuesday. That
makes it look as though the Indians
would have to face him again to
morrow, as Buchanan will undoubt
edly oppose the Bears today.
Clint Evans, California's fiery
baseball coach, has the rather diffi
j cult job of selecting his pitchers for
| the Trojan battle today and his en
counter with the Indians on Satur
j day. Will Saunders or Horner play
j against the Trojans? The result of
Evans' choice may very well decide
i the pennant.
For three years, beginning as a
j freshman, Norm Horner has suc
' cessfully tamed the Indians. How
ever, those fans who saw the first
game of last year's series, will re
call that it took the flukiest break
ever seen in college baseball to give
Horner his victory.
Cards Can Hit
This year's Stanford baseball team
is unquestionably stronger at the
bat than last year's aggregation.
Added to this extra punch there is
Dan Johnson. The Cards have al
w«*ys been able to collect a fair
share of hits off the Bear pitcher,
but have never been able to keep
the Blue and Gold hitters from col
lecting their portion of blows,
j Allowing the California team
seven hits at the very most it looks
as though Harry Wolter's men
would be able to push over enough
runs to clinch the games. Satur
day's game, being the first, is prob
ably the most important game to
win psychologically.
