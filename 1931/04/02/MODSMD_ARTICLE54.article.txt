# U.C.L.A., STANFORD TENNIS TILTS ARE HERE TOMORROW
## Second Encounter Of Two Schools Will Be Hard Fought Battle 
### 
With the definite addition of Cliff
Robbins to the U.C.L.A. net line-up
tomorrow, the return struggle with
the Bruins should turn out to be a
far greater battle than the Southern
match last week. Robbins will run
up against Captain Ted Easton, how
ever, who will prove to be no set-up.
Keith Gledhill is sure to have a
tougher time with Elbert Lewis in
the feature match of the day, due
to Lewis' improved condition. The
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate cham
pion was easy prey for the local
first man last week, dropping his
match 6-2, 6-1. He downed Captain
Alan Blade of the Bears, however,
although the Bruins lost by the
close score of to 3V2.

Furthermore, the southern match
was played in a high wind which
made the game much less steady
and true to form. With these definite
advantages in their favor over the
initial encounter, the Bruins are
expected to make more headway in
the return engagement, although
the Indian netsters are favored to
win tomorrow's contest.

It has not yet been definitely de
cided whether or not the Nieder
auer-Cox combination will perform
against the invaders, but it is fairly
certain that the remainder of the
team set up against the Los Angeles
squads will compete. Besides Gled-,
hill and Easton will be Joe Cough
lin, Harry Plymire, and probably
Trow Stephens.
