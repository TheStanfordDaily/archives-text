# SAN JOSE RUNNERS FAVORED TO DOWN BABE TRACK STARS
## 
### 
Despite their fine season record,
the freshman track team will enter
their meet with San Jose State next
Saturday morning as the underdogs.

If all the members of the babe
squad were in condition to repeat
their best season performances, the
story might be different, but illness,
injury, and the 10-day vacation lay
off, have taken their toll.

Van Dellen, frosh pole-vaulter
who cleared 12 feet 3 inches in the
first meet of the season, and Art
Azevedo, intramural cross-country
champion, and stepper of a 4:37
mile, are two potential point-getters
handicapped by illness.

However, Jimmy Willson, Elling
ton's chief reliance in the sprints,
has recovered from a pulled muscle.
Lyman will be another thorn in the
San Jose side, if his best marks of
132 feet in the discus and 48
feet in the shot are indicators. He
has won both these events in every
meet this season.

The two most versatile members
of the freshman team, Meier and
Packard, who have been scoring
some twelve points apiece in the
hurdle races and jumps each meet,
are also on deck and in shape.
