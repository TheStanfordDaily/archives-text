## Local Entrants Expected To Go Far In Annual Joint Tourney 
### Tom Pockman 
With three Indian mittmen com
j pcting in the annual minor sporis
| battles scheduled for the Oakland
i Auditorium tomorrow and Saturday
i evenings, local ring activity is now
| at its height.
Coach Harry Maloncy's entrants
j are Captain Johnson, Fred Glover,
| and Gordon Gilbert. Johnson will
| box as a middleweight, Glover,
! feather, and Gilbert, light-heavy.
All three men have been working
! out in preparation for the meet for
: the past month and should be in
i excellent condition. Tonight the
I boys will taper off with a light
| workout and then rest until they
I climb through the ropes tomorrow
: night.
Friday night all bouts will be
! elimination matches, with the finals
| scheduled for Saturday in the same
I ring. If the Cardinal entries show
j the class ihey have displayed all
j year, they stand a good chance of
| reaching the final round.
Glover, who has won all of his
1 fights this year by early knockouts,
should take the featherweight title.
However, he will meet the toughest
competition of the year when he
collides with representatives of other
northern California schools. Cali
fornia Aggies, San Francisco Uni
versity, Nevada, and the coast
conference colleges are expected to
have teams entered.
Gilbert, who has been coming
, along rapidly under the watchful
eye of Coach Maloney, should also
make himself known in the tourney.
Johnson, one of the cleverest boxers
i in the University, can take care of
himself equally well and will cause
a lot of trouble before the last bout
I is over.
