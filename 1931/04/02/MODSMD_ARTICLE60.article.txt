# OPPORTUNITY FOR LABOR STUDY THIS SUMMER OFFERED
## Schedule To Have Local Seminar On Current Social Problems 
### 
For those interested in working
this summer, plans have been made
for a Students-in-Industry group
whose members will work in San
Francisco under the same conditions
as the ordinary working man - and
hold weekly seminars to discuss their
experiences and problems.
Similar groups are being planned
for Los Angeles and other large cities
especially for those living at home
and working independently of Stu
dents-in-Industry seminars. Discus-

sions, speakers, and organized trips
will help to pool experiences. '
Preliminary groups in the various
colleges,' for those who must work
when and where they can, will be or
ganized. Professors anu qualified
students of economics and social sci
ences will help Stanford students to
study problems rather than to pas
sively observe them.

Miss Blossom Perry, National In
dustrial Secretary of the Y.W.C.A.
who will be in charge of the San
Francisco group, intends to follow
the general lines of last year's experi
ment in which each person started
out with fifteen dollars which was to
last him until he obtained a job. Liv
ing quarters were found in the work
ing people's section, with no assist
ance from home.
