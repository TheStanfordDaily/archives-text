# GIRL BREAKS KNEE ON LOCAL COURSE
## 
### 
Stepping up to play a difficult iron
shot on the 10th hole of the golf
course Tuesday afternoon, Thelma
Patton, former Stanford star track
athlete and world record holder,
stumbled into a gopher hole and
broke her leg at the knee.
Three students who were nearby
took her to the Palo Alto Hospital
where Dr. R. L. Wilbur, Jr., set the
leg in a cast. Latest reports indicate
that she is progressing as well as
may be expected.
