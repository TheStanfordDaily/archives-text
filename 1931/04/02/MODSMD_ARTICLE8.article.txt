# CHICAGO'S SCENT
## 
### 
AKRON, 0., April 1. (NEA)â€”
Aviators have many interesting ways
of locating cities when flying after
dark, but flyers know they are near
ing Akron by the peculiar odor of
cooking rubber hanging over this
city, where many tires are made.
The airmen say Chicago's upper air
J smells of the stockyards.
