# CITY RECOVERS FROM RUINS OF EARTH SHOCKS
## Chaos Exists In Nicaraguan Capital; Food Supplies Rushed To Scene HOSPITALS CROWDED Marines Control Disorders Among Natives 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, April 2.
(/P) â€”Working under enormous dif
ficulties in the chaos which followed
Tuesday's earthquake and fire,
Managua is pulling itself out of ihe
misery of disaster.
Colonel F. L. Bradman, comman
der of the Marines, estimated today
that 2,000 had perished and 700
bodies already have been taken out
of the ruins. Property damage is
placed at nearly $70 000,000.
Americans Aid
American surgeons and doctors
from neighboring Central American
countries are working in impro
vised operating rooms, salving the
injuries of hundreds, fighting off the
danger of pestilence.
Food has come in, and blankets
for thousands who must sleep in
the open. The United States minis
ter said today he thought the city
could recover and go on with the
supplies which have arrived in the
past two days.
State Records Lost
It seemed likely today that the
seat of the government might be
moved to Granada, for administra
tion buildings here were wrecked
and all the state records burned or
buried.
Broken in mind by their awful
experiences, a handful of natives
attacked a searching party today,
but the Marines stood them off with
fixed bayonets.
Down on the lake front despair
ing Natives sat all day on the i"ocks.
In the hills hundreds of others were
living and sleeping without shelter.
Along the roads out of town strag
glers walked toward Granada.
Urgent Cases First
Terrible as was the disaster itself,
and bitter the necessity for burning
the bodies of the dead in a yawning
fissure opened by the quake on one
of the nearby hills, the tents thrown
up as surgical operating stations
have housed events as harrowing.
The most urgent cases came first,
but dressing stations have been
working night and day bandaging
less seriously injured and giving
first aid.
