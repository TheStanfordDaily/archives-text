# RASKOB URGES DEFINITE ISSUE ON PROHIBITION
## Democrats Have Excellent Presidency Prospect, Declares Leader 
### 
NEW YORK, April 2. (>P) —John
J. Raskob, chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee, declared
in an interview with the New York
Evening Post today that the Demo
crats never had a better opportunity
to win the presidency than in 1932.
But he added this proviso:
"Providing it has the strength to
take a courageous stand in its plat
form declarations, particularly on
prohibition as well as on other eco
nomic questions."
"The party," he said, "should also
provide strong leadership that will
restore sanity in government."
Liquor Cost Stressed
Mr. Raskob estimated the Ameri
can people pay $3,000,000,000 annu
ally for liquor. The cost of the li
quor business proper, he said, is
$300,000,000 and racketeering adds
$1,700,000,000.
Asked what he thought of efforts
to make Tammany Hall a national
issue in 1932, the Democratic chair
man said:
"I don't think they can do it. The
Republican Party will probably
seize on some irrelevent thing, par
ticularly if the Democratic Party
makes a courageous stand."
Public Vote Urged
The Evening Post said that cer
tain Democratic leaders are agitat
ing for a platform plank that would
commit the candidates elected to
Congress to vote for a resolution
under which the people of the states
would decide whether the 18th
Amendment should be retained or
whether the control of liquor
should be returned to the states.
The paper pointed out that such a
plank would avoid the word "re
peal."

In the interview the national
chairman had nothing to say about
the individual candidates for his
party's nomination to the presidency.
