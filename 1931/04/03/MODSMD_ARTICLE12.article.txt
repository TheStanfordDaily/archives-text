# ALASKAN TRAVELS BY DOG TEAM, AIR DESCRIBED IN TALK
## 
### 
Traveling in Alaska in winter was
described by Mrs. H. D. Anderson in
her talk before the Stanford Dames
in the Women's Clubhouse yesterday
afternoon.
Mrs. Anderson told of her trip
by dog team across northern and
central Alaska, and of the severe
hardships and unusual experiences
which accompany winter travel in
this northern region. In most places,
she said, her party was forced to
break their own trails over virgin
snow. Particularly interesting to
the club members was her descrip
tion of her airplane trip over Mt.
McKinley. This was the Jirst air
plane to accomplish this feat.
At the business meeting, which
followed the talk by Mrs. Anderson,
the members cracked almonds,
which will be roasted, salted, and
sold to benefit the Women's Gym
fund, at 75 cents a pound. The
almonds may be bought from now
until April 16 by phoning Mrs. Vir
gil Anderson at Palo Alto 5664.
