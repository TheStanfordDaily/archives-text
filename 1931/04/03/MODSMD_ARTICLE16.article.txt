# Brazilian is Struck By Quaint Attire of Rough
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Slouching attire of the Stanford
rough and spring frocks of the "50"
find an appreciative critic in Profes
sor Gilberto Freyre, Brazilian schol
ar and new member of the history
department, who has come here this
quarter after spending last fall in
research work at the libraries of
Lisbon and Coimbra in Portugal.
"The architecture and the palms
of Stanford suggest Brazil," he said
in giving his impression, "but in
outward appearance, your students
could not offer a greater contrast to
the formality of universities in
Portugal, where all students go
about in black berets and long black
robes, substituting politics for foot
ball—the latter characteristic also
of Brazilian students."
The traditional American-born
idea of the Mediterranean college
student serenading, with a rose
above the car, is exploded by Pro
fessor Freyre. The Portuguese stu
dent is most practical, he declares.
Frevre has been a recent specta
tor of revolutions in both Brazil
and in Spain.

I Here to conduct a lecture course
\on the history of Brazil, Freyre
j gives a significant glimpse of the
possibilities of South America. En
gineers, industrial chemists, geolo
gists, and medical students are in
demand, he says.
For the Stanford student with a
yearning for fame and fortune in the
relatively unexploited southern con
tinent, Professor Freyre recomends
knowledge of adaptability, a good
general education, and a fluent
knowledge of Spanish, unless in
Brazil, where Portuguese is spoken.
A summer school for American
| students has been established in Rio
ide Janeiro, with some of the best
i Brazilian scholars as lecturers. In
creasing attention is being given in
Brazil to American history and lit
-1 erature, and modern American
economists and sociojpgists furnish
i popular texts.
; "As a Brazilian lam delighted to
find at Stanford an excellent li
brary on Brazilian history and lit
erature, the Banner collection of
fering rare and valuable books,"
i Freyre concluded.
