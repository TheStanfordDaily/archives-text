# SWAIN VETOES MOVE TO NAME EX. CHEATERS
## Possibility Of Lawsuits Is Grounds For Action; Expulsion Okehed 
### 
The decision of the Men's and
Women's Councils to announce the
names of all students permanently
expelled from the University for
Honor Code violations was yester
day reversed by Acting-President
Swain on grounds of possible legal
actions that might result.
Dr. Swain informed the Councils
of his action at a joint meeting of
the two bodies yesterday at which
he discussed with them matters of
policy concerning Honor Code en
forcement. He urged that the Code
be rigorously enforced by the Coun
cils.
Explains Position
In explaining his position con
cerning the publication of convicted
violators' | names, the acting presi
dent made the following statement:
"After giving the question careful
consideration, I am of the opinion
that it would not be wise to pub
lish the names of students convicted
of violations of the Honor Code.
This conviction has not been reached
out of any feeling of sympathy for
the offenders, for I have none. The
University is back of the student
councils in their determination to
rid it of every student convicted
of cheating in examinations.
New Penalty Involved
"But the publication of the names
of offenders brings in a new pen
alty, which has never been imposed
here. If, perchance, a student were
convictbd on mistaken evidence, he
would not only have been done an
irreparable injury, but because of
the deliberate publication of his
conviction, the basis would be laid
for an action at law against the Uni
versity."
The sentence of permanent ex
pulsion from the University of a stu
dent twice convicted of violating
the Code, recomended by the Men's
Council, has been approved by
Dr. Swain.
