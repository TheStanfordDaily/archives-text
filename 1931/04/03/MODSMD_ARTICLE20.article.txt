# "AXE REGAINED!" 1 YEAR AGO TODAY
## 
### 
One year ago tonight 21 young
I men journeyed home from Berkeley
in rather fast time to bring back to
(he campus a famous hatchet. The
i Stanford Daily blossomed out with
an "Axe Regained!" streamer, and
the Daily Californian carried an "Ax
Stolen" banner.
It's all in how one looks at it. but
just the same today is the first an
niversary of the Stanford-California
Ax(e) in its home at the American
Trust Company's Palo Alto branch.
There in a vault will remain the
historic weapon until California
I "steals it again" or the two schools
I decide to bury the hatchet.
