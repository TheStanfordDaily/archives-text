# ROUGHS, ROUTED FROM CONDUITS, EXPLORE ATTICS
## 
### 
A sequel to the famous saga
of the Stanford underground
conduit system appears with
the discovery of Roughdom's
airway route around the Quad
through a system of connect
ing attics.
The garret route, as yet un
explored by the Daily investi
gator. is said to be reached by
scaling a 20 foot pipe in the
hollow arch of the Memorial
Court, or by a trapdoor in the
upper reaches of the Admini
stration Building.
Flashlights, wavering through
the perpetual gloom, scare up
dark wraiths, and cautious
footsteps startle the dust of
years from heavy timbers.
A copy of the Daily of 1906,
then the Daily Palo Alto, left
by some workman repairing
the earthquake damage, was
found by one explorer. The
ancient copy tells of two mem
bers of the 500 "thrown from
their carriage when the horse
took fright at an automobile";
also that Stanford beat Cali
fornia in baseball. 1 to fl, and
that "Encina held its first
'open house,' potted plants
banking the stairway."
