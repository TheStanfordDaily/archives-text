# L.A.A.C. MEET MAY HINGE ON CLOSING EVENT
## Templeton To Take 30 On Trip South; Cards Given Chance MAY SET RELAY MARK Indians Should Make Clean Sweep In Sprints 
### Stewart Crawford 
Boarding the Lark tonight headed
for Los Angeles and the toughest
dual meet on the 19131 schedule,
Coach Robert L. (Dink) Templeton
and approximately thirty redshirted
trackmen will tomorrow take on the
galaxy of stars which make up the
I powerful L.A.A.C. track squad in
the first real test of the current
. Indian season.
Though at present the clubmen
| are conceded by many to have the
[strongest aggregation of track and
field men on the coast, the Cardinals
should be able to keep abreast of
, the Southerners until the relay, and
I then cinch the affair with something
| close to record time in that event.
Howell Out
With Jimmy Howell, regular Stan-
J ford one-lapper, out with a pulled
muscle, Templeton's quartet may not
go under 3:20. However, if Dink
decides to run Les Hables in How
ell's place, he and his brother Ike,
with Maynor Shove and Ben East
man, could very possibly better the
3:15.4 collegiate record set by last
: year's Indian four.
Shove is running better than ever
. before, having pushed Eastman to
that 48.1 last Tuesday in something
under 49 seconds.. Les Hables is
capable of better than 49 flat, even
after running in the sprints, which
is better than Jimmy Howell could
do on the 1930 record-breaking
team. But Dink may not decide to
go after a new mark, since 3:20 is
; all he needs to beat the club.
Sprints Arc Cinch
The Indians are a cinch to pile up
I a big lead on the cinderpaths, with
Les Hables, Hec Dyer, and Frank
| Lombardi favored to collect at least
16 points in the dash events. Only
in Ken Robinson, who ran a 9.8
hundred against California last
week, has Comstock a dash threat.
The sensational Redshirt pair should
battle it out around 9.G, with Lom
bardi trying for a third. The fur
long looks like a sweep for Stan
ford.
After taking nine more points in
1 the 440, the Indians may encounter
little difficulty in the half, caused
jby one Jack Barton of L.A.A.C.,
i while another club entry, Ferris
; Webster, could be in there with
! 1:55.4, his best time last year.
In the performance of Wright and
: Cooper in the tryouts before the
i Husky meet, the Cardinal coach
found a pair of potential point-get
! ters where he most needed them.
' Both ran under 1:57.9 on this occa
. sion, breaking two minutes for the
i first time.
This clubman, Orval Martin, is a
( cinch in the mile, while Bob Brown
will have to step to pull three points
out of this x - ace. Elmo, of the hosts,
and Aebersold may stage quite a
battle in the eight-lap affair, with a
I possibility that the redshirted star
may surpass his best previous time
with something close to 9:50.
Welsha and Maxweil give the club
an advantage in the barrier events,
where Captain Podge Smith is given
a meagre chance for a first in the
I high sticks, and a probable second
| in the lows.
On the field. Comstock's strong
men will have it pretty much their
own way in everything but the dis-
