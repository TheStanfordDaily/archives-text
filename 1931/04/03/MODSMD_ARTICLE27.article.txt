# VOLUNTEERS FORWARD

Reeause of circumstances which could not possibly be
avoided, the campus theatrical heads find themselves faced
with the task of putting on the Junior Opera in something
less than three weeks. That in itself is a job of no mean
proportions, but to make it doublv difficult, there is a la
mentable shortage of experienced men to construct the
sets for the opera.
The shortage occurs because no class in Theatre Work
shop is being given this spring, and it is the students iiHhat
class who always build the sets for the opera. This year
the task has fallen on the shoulders of four youths who
had taken the work before and who have donated their
services that the opera might succeed.
Four men, however, are not sufficient to do all the work
connected with the construction of the sets, and they have
issued a plea for more volunteers who have had similar ex
perience. If the opera is fo be put over, thai call must be
heeded. There is no oilier remedv.
