Just how well are the schools of California "attending
to business?" Are student activities, admittedly on the in
crease, worth the time of pupils and teachers which they
consume? This was one of the problems considered by the
California Commission for the Study of Kdueational Prob
lems, which recently submitted a detailed report of its
findings to the governor and the legislature.
"Distractions," the commission reported, "are not neces
sarily bad if kepi within proper bounds." Rut in many
cases activities within the schools were found to be so nu
merous and complicated as to require a major share of
students' time. One school reported ( .M> organizations.
To check this over-emphasis on extra-curricular ac
tivities, the commission recommended that the state de
partment of education prepare regulations covering the
use of school time for activities. School principals and
superintendents were asked to assess the value of these
activities, to determine whether they justified the present
use of school time and money.
Substituting universities and colleges for high schools
in the commission's report, the findings would fairly ac
curately express Ihe congestion of demands upon student
time in university life. Interests tire many and varied;
they have so encroached upon individual time that in some
cases study and class hours are mere incidents in the daily
program.
One most common problem of college students is this
one of finding time. It is a problem which deserves fully
as much attention ;is the multiplicity of high school ac
tivities.
