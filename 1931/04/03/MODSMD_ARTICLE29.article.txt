# A 						REMEDY FOR SPAIN
## 
### 
Karlv American politicians had the right idea. They
gave the college student in this country a football to kick
around. In Spain, South American countries, and other
way points, university students have no football to kick'
so they use "whoever happens to be king or president at
that particular time when they wish to give vent to their
spleen.
Instead of importing Fords, we suggest that Spain and
the other mentioned nations hire American football
coaches to teach their young hopefuls the gentle, yet manly
game of football, where not only the players engaged in
the combat, but the spectators (which will be students, of
course) may take part in little tete-a-tetes before and after
each game, as is the custom in many American institutions
of learning. They can then riot to their hearts' content.
The Chicago police custom of laisscz fairc as far as her
gangsters are concerned may be practiced on rioting Latin
students engaged in football games. Then the ruling mon
arch or president may sit back and chisel his dear sub
jects to his heart's content in the grand American custom,
while the students slowly, but surely eliminate themselves
from further combat.
In this manner both the king and his younger subjects
are satisfied. The king is left free lo rule and the students
are free lo riot. A good plan and we guarantee il to work.
For references, ask any American president The Daily
Trojan.

I'.S.C. is nnnoved because a stage act features one of
their football songs. Urging action, the Daily Trojan said:
"Perhaps if the student body were to hear a radio program
with a theme song advertising shoes or pig-knuckles set to
the strains of 'Fight On!' there would be a howl."
Of course, advertising pig-skins is something else.
