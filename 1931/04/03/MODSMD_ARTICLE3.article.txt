### 
CIIADES of the old round-
house! Campus journalism
cainc to an abrupt stop yes
terday while future writers
paused in their daily tasks to
see the latest style in motor
transportation- to appear on
the campus.
The center of all this attrac
tion was a 1!)24 model of a
Doble steam car, incased in a
long, low Murphy body. Hiss
ing away in front of the Press
Building, quietly minding its
own business, it was surround
ed by a rubberneck audience
to whom the owner explained
that the car was in a "run
down" condition and would
only do NO miles an hour. Cap
able of tremendous power. Ibis
machine can go up hills so fast
—according to the owner—
that the driver has to keep the
brakes—by Lincoln—on most
of the lime.
Many brilliant gadgets on
Hie dash board attracted one of
the "higher ups" on the Daily
staff. Later it was noticed that
the steam pressure had dropped
from 1700 to 1200. Evidently
someone had "let oIV steam."
