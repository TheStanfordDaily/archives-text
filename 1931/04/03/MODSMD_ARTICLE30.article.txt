There is no argument to today's |
piece, hut it has its golden point. It
seems ihat a textbook was left in
the library and when we returned 1
after supper, it was gone. Now, text
books being most dead objects, it
can readily be deduced that the
book left the library under mo'ive I
power—other than its own.
Now, we are not complaining, for |
after all nothing has been wasted. .

is not a social waste, but is a mere

Jean stole to relieve hanger—and ;
eating is such a mundane affair. The j
person who disregarded the old
Spanish custom of private property '
in our case was satisfying a finer, !

To think that in this material !
world there should still be one per- |

preciates the finer things in life fully
compensates me for the loss of that
root of all evil which most men are

But, perhaps, we arc judging too
hastily. It may be that some forget

It is most likely that some person |

that they were his own booßs. Still J
! having undying faith that the

I and not textbooks, we are now con
i vinced that this is how the kid- 1

It also must be very flattering to i

i preference to other volumes nearby.

i driven to his actions by financial
j considerations but rather by an un

I and not textbooks, we are now con
i vinced that this is how the kid- 1

1 yond the peradventure of a possible
doubt, that the son of Stanford who ;
j accidentally took my book was not i
i driven to his actions by financial
j considerations but rather by an un

its own sake.
We do' wish to thank the indi- j
vidual in question for not taking our i
