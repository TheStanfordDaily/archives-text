THE NIGHT LIFE OF THE GODS.
By Thome Smith; Doubleday
Doran. 52.50. (At the jPalo Alto
Book Shop.)
Hunter Hawk discovered, through
a little atom juggling, that he could
change man to stone and —more im
portant—stone to man. Forthwith he
petrified his naggingly designing
family and resusciated the Olym
pians. The metropolitan wanderings
of these ebullient mighties approach
the hysterical.
The book is a combination of Sen
nettic slapstick, the sophistication
of a Michael Aden, and the humor
of the smoking car. If Smith had
not turned maudlin in the final
paragraphs he would have avoided
a rather false ending which remains
the one note dissenting from a har
moniously insane chord.
Boston will probably call out all
reserve literary wowsers when the
book is discovered. And the chances
are not against our receiving a note
deploring our depravity in so en
thusing over dangerous trash.

READER. I MARRIED lIIM. By
Anne Green. E. P. Dutton, New
York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
"Reader, I Married Him," is a
satire on an American family living
in Paris, meeting fortune hunters,
running through their own fortune,
falling in love, and employing magic
to straighten out their troubles. Be
cause it is satire, situations turn out
satisfactorily. Because of the excess
number of situations, the choice of
the title, taken from a line in "Jane
Eyre," appears slightly without rea
son.
Of the seven prominent charac
ters, Catherine Douglass is the only
one who seems natural —Catherine
who tied a knot in an elastic, used
a little Coue, called it magic, and
thereby married the man she loved.
Miss Green's style is brilliantly
entertaining at first, but slumps into
triviality. However, the unusual oc
currence of having a good ending
makes up for some of the absurdity.

FOR A SONG. By Kunrad Bcico
vich. Dodd, Mead and Co., 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
This is the story of a young Ital
ian-American girl whose sole am
bition is to sing at the Metropolitan
with the purpose of revenging her
father's ill treatment by her mother

jin some obscure and unexplained
! Freudian way.
Writing about opera singers, im
presarios, and musicians, Bercovich
| has produced an opera himself with
! the music of words. From the very
i beginning, with the introduction of
' the Rabelaisian figure of Alberti
Husso, magnificently proportioned,
! physically and mentally, to the de
: nouement when the young hopeful,
!at the eve of great success finds
| that she no longer wants revenge
! and so can no longer sing, the story
| has the power and the beauty of a
1 great symphony.
The- book rises to crescendos of
j tragedy when Paul, the young boot
; legger, is sentenced to death, and
runs through a medley of emotions
with its descriptions of Little Italy
in New York.
The characters are heroic even
when they are pathetic like Wein
stein and Connolly, the junk dealers
and Ginsberg the usurer. The char
acters of Husso, the great singer and
idol of the Italians, and Marcus, the
charlatan art dealer, are truly great.
An excellent book and worth
reading, but not if you want frivolity
and something light. —S. C. A.
