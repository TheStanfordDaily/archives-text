# IS MITZI CUTE?

. but Mitzi Green, Holly
wood's 'cute' little girl, takes all the
acting honors without a struggle."
This gem appeared in a review of
"Finn and Hattie" in your estimable
sheet this morning. Just what, Mr.
Editor, do you have around the of
fice for reviewers? Just why, Mr.
Editor, do you have to run such
fearful tripe as this?

I Why did the reviewer put quotes |
around the word cute? There is j
nothing in Miss Green's record to >
show that she is only allegedly cute. 1
That is the whole trouble. She is so
damned cute that her mere presence j
on the screen is more than sufficient '
j to sicken anyone with even a trace
of the finer sensibilities. Since they !
have been told that she is cute, !
Mitzi and her director feel that they j
owe it to their public to keep Mitzi
irreparably cute all the time.
Only a reviewer with a seriously
distorted vision could compare the
so-called, self-styled acting of Mitzi !
Green with a finished performer like j
Zasu Pitts, or with a skillful humor
ist like Leon Errol. The maneuvers '
and the rasping voice of cute Mitzi, !
far from acting, are grievious blots
on the reels of an otherwise pretty •
good picture. Would it be too much
to ask, Mr. Editor, that you make
, some attempt to locate someone with j
a shadow of intelligence and appre- |
ciation for a review or two?
