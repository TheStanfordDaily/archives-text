r lhe last of California's big
three in football to issue the
spring call, Stanford quietly be
gan work Wednesday afternoon
when 85 men turned out in suits
to go through a few limbering
up exercises under the direction
of the Old Fox. This number is
neither smaller nor larger than
the usual response, and Pop
Warner is not making any
threats, promises, or statements
of any kind.
Contrast this with the general up
roar created on sports pages all
over the coast when the first call
was sounded up at Berkeley, or even
with the comment that accompanied
the initial workout of Howard
Tones's'Trojans. The advent of Coach
'Navy Bill" Ingram as /new leader
jf the Bears, following upon the
heels of the Nibs Price fiasco was
lot news, we grant you.
Nevertheless, it is interesting
to note how displeased the U.C.
mentor was with a turnout of
12:> men, and that he let the
world know he was thoroughly
dissatisfied, while poor old S.U.
struggles along with 85, and not
a word. According to Ingram,
there is no such tiling as a "mas
ter mind" in the grid game, and
(liat will lie clearly demonstrated
in the 1931 Big Game. We have
a hunch that something Mill be
demonstrate;! on that coming
great day, despite the record
turnout across the bay.
"Tiny" Thornhill, Pop's assistant,
;ays that the Old Man has been
■ontcmplating something new this
ear in the form of a weekly prac
;ce game every Friday during the
•ntire spring session. "Tiny" thinks
I would be great stuff. "The bpys
alee a lot more interest in a real
;ame, and work harder than in the
outine scrimmage," he says. And
lesides that we say that a weekly
ontest would add a lot of interest
>r fans in general and scribes in
articular.
There have been some sports
laden week-ends around the
Farm this year, but the one
coining up takes the prize hands
down. The track team leaves to
night for the L.A.A.C. meet, the
toughest of the season; the hail
nine plays its deciding Trojan
game this afternoon and its first
Bear tilt tomorrow; tennis is on
tap with the Bruins today and
U.S.C. tomorrow; the freshman
horschiders tangle with the
Blue and Gold babes, and the
yearling oval outfit faces San
«Josc State Saturday. Add to this
the minor sports carnival in
wl :-.-!i the four major California
universities are contesting in
golf, fencing, boxing, wrestling,
and gymnastics both today and
tomorrow!
Despite this pregnant schedule,
10 vital question of the hour seems
> be this: "What will happen to
' [y. Robert Lyman Templton's boys
hen they go up against Mr. Boyd
omstock's aggregation of track
ars in the South tomorrow?" If
iu believe the rival coaches,
.A.A.C. will triumph. The club
entdr has stated emphatically that
s athletes will win, while Dink
ys only: "We'll take a licking."
We have a sneaking suspicion,
however, that America's Boy
Coach is trying to pull some of
the well-known wool over some
body's eyes. Mr. Comstock can
wear out a dozen pencils on his
dope sheet, and still put no
more than 63 points in the bag.
At least he cannot hope to have
more than that by the time he's
figured everything but the mile
Veiay. So to win, he must be
planning to surprise the world
and take that event from Tem
pleton's super quartet. Oh Mr.
Comstock, how could you!
