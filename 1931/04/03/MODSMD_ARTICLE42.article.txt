# Stanford Faces Trojans, Bears on Diamond
## U.S.C. FAVORED IN ENCOUNTER TODAY; GRIFFIN PITCHING Horner Will Pitch Against Johnson Tomorrow At Berkeley 
### Francis Lloyd 
Facing the most difficult assign
■ ments that they have encountered
; this year, Stanford's varsity nine has
! to meet the two competitors for
I the conference title, Southern Cali
-5 fornia and California, today and to
i morrow, with the Trojan game
! scheduled this afternoon at 3:15
o'clock in the local park.
Hopes for Stanford's first pennant
in the Coast Conference will depend
largely on the outcome of these two
games. The Indians have not won
a game from California since 1927,
j nor a series in the last six years.
Ernie Nevers was the last Stanford
I pitcher to give the Farm a series
I win over the Bears.
i
I Bears Win
t In view of the Bears' victory yes
| terday over the Trojans by the
j rather easy score of 6-1, Harry
; Wolter will either start Eddie or
Caddell in today's game. At the pres
ent time it wouid seem as though
Eddie would get the job because of
| his showing against the Bruins an
the South.
Having defeated the Cards in the
south, Griffin, the bespectacled Tro
jan hurler, will attempt to add an
other Indian scalp to his collection
this afternoon. Griffin has never
| exhibited shutout ball, and if Stan
j ford can get any sort of pitching,
! fans on the Farm should see a vic
; tory for the Redshirts today.
Horner vs. Johnson
An unknown hurler named
George Winchester pitched the
Bears to a brilliant victory over the
! Trojans today. This leaves Clint
Evans with Horner to pitch against
the Indians tomorrow and with his
I sensational sophomore, Saunders, as
j a relief chucker.
Opposed to Norm Horner, late
' custodian of the Axe, Harry Wolter
will have the bright particular star
| of baseball on the Farm this year
in Dan Johnson who will attempt
I to steal the Indian sign which Hor
i ner has held over the Cards, all
! these many years.
Livermore Catcher
Although he only collected three
i hits on the Indian Southern trip,
: Ike Livermore, by his good alt
| around play, will start behind the
i bat in both contests. Livermore's
; arm has been improving in eft'ec-
I tiveness in every game in which he
I has played this season.
A victory over the Trojans and
I the Bears, today and tomorrow,
j would make the chances for a con
; ference pennant for Stanford fairly
i certain. The Cards have only eight
; games left to play, of which four
are practically assured victories. A
j victory today would give the Red-
I shirts the Trojan series and would
! leave only California as a serious
| contender for the pennant.
Indian Sluggers
j Three men stand out in the Indian
j lineup as being able to collect six
i or more hits between them in each
of the games to be played today and
I tomorrow —Delmas, Philippi, and
Rintala. All of these men are
dangerous at all times, and it will
be remembered that Rudy Rintala
was not bothered a great deal by
Horner last year.
Both Spud Hardy and Dykes
Johnson have played excellent base
ball both offensively and defen
sively in the games so far this sea
son. Hardy particularly has im
proved his hitting by at least .100
over last year, while Johnson has
been deadly with his accurate peg
and handling of ground balls.
It would perhaps be too opti*
mistic to say that Stanford is fa
vored to win these two games, but
the Cards can certainly be given an
even chance to come out ahead.
