# COLLEGIATE GOLFERS TO MEET TODAY ON LINKS; WILL SETTLE CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
With the California intercollegiate
golf championship as the spoils,
Stanford's collection of crack club
swingers starts trying to be the vic
tor in the golf competition of the
minor sports carnival this morning
at 9 o'clock on the University course.
Opposing them will be teams from
U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and California, all
of them strong enough to upset the
favored Indians. The Bears, al
though they have lost a dual meet
to the Cards this season, have a
team on which Herb Schultz, North
ern California champion, is third
man. U.S.C.'s strong sextet has been
practicing on the Stanford course
since last Monday to familiarize
themselves with the local layout.
Play today is to consist of 2G holes
medal play for all six members of
each team. To the group with the
low four-man total goes the team

' title and the right to meet the
Northern section winner-for the Pa
cific Coast crown.
Players with the eight low scores
will qualify for the individual cham- j
pionship to be decided by 18-hole ,
match play contests on Saturday
and Sunday. Whichever individual
emerges victorious is crowned Cali
fornia intercollegiate champion and i
meets the Northern title winner for
the Pacific Coast championship.
Members of Stanford's team, ac- [
i cording to Coach Garry Bennett,
| are MacNaughton, Eichelberger, Ed
i monds, Goldwater, Hawley, and
either Captain Stevenson .or Hell
! man.
MacNaughton, holder of the coui'se
! record, and Winston Fuller of U.S.C. i
are to compose the first twosome I
which tees off. They get under way
at 9 o'clock and are followed by ten
j other couples.
