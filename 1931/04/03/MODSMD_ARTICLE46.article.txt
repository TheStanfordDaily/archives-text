Five members of the varsity fenc
ing squad will compete .this after
noon and evening in the minor
sports matches scheduled for the
Pavilion.

Foils encounters are slated for 2
o'clock, with saber battles set for 7 j
o'clock. Captain Jack Snyder, Leon- !
ard Pockman, and John Ferguson

California foilsmen in the afternoon. â€¢
Indian entrants for the evening j
bouts are Captain-elect Leonard
Pockman, Tom Pockman, and James j
Reed.
Possibilities of a double Cardinal ;
win today are good, as the local ]
squad is the strongest in several I
years. The Indians having already j
handily defeated the Bears, Ihe stil
fest competition is expected from j
U.S.C. The Trojans have developed I
a powei'ful squad under the direc- |
tion of Harry Uttenhove, famous j
Belgian fencing master.
U.C.L.A. also can be counted on
for a real battle, as several star ;
fencers are now attending the south- i
ern school.

A dispatch from Biobio, Chile, said j
that a 22-year-old woman who had j
been apparently dead for two days |
and nights, came back to life in her j
coffin, escaping burial alive by three
hours.
