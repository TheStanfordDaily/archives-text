# NET TEAM FACES TROJANS, BRUINS IN TWO MATCHES
## Cardinal Racquet Wielders Favored to Repeat Former Victories 
### Richard Van Wagenen 
With plenty to keep the varsity
i netmen busy over the week-end,
! campus fans are due for a real treat
today and tomorrow. U.C.L.A. will
; be on hand for a come-back attempt
'at 1:45 o'clock this afternoon, after
last week's crushing defeat, and the
Trojan racket-wielders are to take
the courts tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock with the same idea in view.
The underdogs so far this season,
having bowed to both California and
! the local team, the Bruins are ex
pected to put up a hard battle, espe
cially with the addition of CI ill'
Robbins, second man.
Gledhill, Lewis Clash
Gledhiil and Lewis will fight it
out for the second time, Indian
1 first man hoping to repeat his (i-2,
6-1 win over the Pacific Coast Con
; ference singles champion.
To add to the varsity men's wor
! ries, U.S.C. will appear on the scene
, tomorrow, bent upon a real attempt
i to even up last week's 7 to 2 score
: in the South. Led by Jack De Lara,
Ihe Trojans may not prove as easy
meat as some expcct, although the
Cards are given a considerable edge
over both their rivals in the week
' end contests.
Lineup Announced
It is fairly definite that Keith
j Gledhill, Captain. Ted Eastoh, Harry
Ply mire, Joe Cough 1 in, Trow Steph
-1 ens, Wilbur Cox, and Phil Nieder
; auer will face both invading teams.
Good tennis weather seems as
| sured. The lack of a high wind, such
|as spoiled the Southern matches,
would render this week's encounters
: far more interesting. It has not been
i thought necessary to erect tempor-
I ary bleachers, although a good-sized
| crowd will probably witness the con
j test from the permanent gallery.
