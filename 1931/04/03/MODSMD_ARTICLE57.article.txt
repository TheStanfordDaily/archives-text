# LADIES' AID SOCIETY MEETS ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
The home of Professor and Mrs.
William A. Cooper was the scene of
a meeting yesterday afternoon of
the Ladies' Aid Society of Trinity
Lutheran Church.
Plans for an "overall" party to be
held at the San Antonio Country
Clubhouse on April 15 were made.
Sewing of patches onto overalls,
with a coin concealed under each
patch for the benefit of the church
will be a feature of the party.
