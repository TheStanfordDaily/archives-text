# CHAIN STORE IS FORENSIC TOPIC
## U.C.L.A., Stanford In No Decision Debates 
### 
Debating on the chain store, Stan
ford met U.C.L.A. last night in the
Little Theatre with William Dien
stein and William Kaye as members
of the affirmative Cardinal squad,
and Howard Harrison and Bernard
Jefferson supporting the negative.
The question was, "Resolved; That
the further expansion of the chain
store is detrimental to the best in
terests of the American people."

The affirmative speakers attacked
on the basis that chain stores stand
ardized too many phases of Ameri
can life; that they did not develop
new territory, but only built stores
in established regions.

U.C.L.A. built their case around
the argument that the chain stores,
by more efficient distribution, help
humanity by making goods better
and less expensive. They held that
the chain store has less disadvant
ages than any other system of dis
tribution, and that it is a natural
link in the evolution of economics.
Ben C. Duniway presided. It was
a non-decision debate.
