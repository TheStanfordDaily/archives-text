# EASTER BRINGS EPIDEMIC FEAR TO MANAGUANS
## Religious Fervor Evidenced By Homeless Refugees; Famine Imminent MARTIAL LAW IN FORCE Emergency Hospital Placed In City Of Granada 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, April 5.
(TP) —A strange Easter dawn broke
over the ruins of this earthquake
devastated city bringing scant
realization of its deep religious sig
nificance to the 15,000 homeless
gathered in refugee camps.
The bells of the one church tower
left standing bravely pealed forth a
mournful call for worshippers, but
Easter for the homeless meant mere
ly the resumption of what appears
to them a losing battle for sub
sistence.
Thousands Hungry
So pressing is this battle for life
that the refugees not yet evacuated
found no time to hold services at
their crowded camps. This despite
the fact that most of them are deeply
religious.
The most pitiful drama was en
acted at Laloma, where hundreds
of mothers with infants wailing in
their arms patiently waited for
hours in the milk line.
This Easter morn also found
Managua, once a beautiful city with
85.000 population proud of their
capital and their modern civic halls,
under the strictest of martial law.
Thirty-nine looters were executed
yesterday.
Epidemics Feared
The possibility of smallpox and
typhoid epidemics was dreaded to
day as the promised anti-toxins
failed to arrive from the United
States.
At the city of Granada the more
fortunate of the residents have
courageously responded to the Red
Cross call for aid, and are receiving
the homeless into their homes. An
emergency hospital has also been
established at Granada where phy
sicians fi'om Panama are treating
the injured.
