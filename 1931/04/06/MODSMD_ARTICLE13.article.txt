# Roble Gives Easter Egg Hunt For Convalescents
## 
### 
The career of the average egg is
at most uneventful, and fortunate
indeed were the hen-fruit that
found their way yesterday behind
bushes and trees at the Convales
cent Home.
The carcers of those hard-boiled
ones will be long and varied, be
cause they are now hoarded away
as treasured keepsakes. Several
dozen of them, rainbow-hued, fur
nished 40-odd convalescing children
a happy and hilarious time in the
Easter hunt at the Home.
Some of the young treasure hunt
ers displayed amazing speed and
agility, even on crutches. Every
discovery was marked by excited
cries of "I found a red one!" and
"Cops on that striped pink one!"
The winner, an ambitious young
Spaniard who conducted his egg
hunting campaign with unbelievable i

; i energy, recovered 19 eggs and was
awarded a gorgeous gilded rabbit
|as first prize. The little girl who
i found the largest number—l4—re
ceived a chocolate hen as her re
ward. And the whole spectacle was
. I enjoyed to the utmost by the bed-
I ridden children on the sun porch
: who couldn't take part.
I The egg hunt, an annual affair at
j the Home, was sponsored by a
group of Roble women.
Whether or not the eggs used in

the ones served in the Encina com

j presented the freshmen with dishes
of soft boiled eggs of variegated
colors, most of which are now
tucked away in Encina rooms to be
used for offense or defense at some
