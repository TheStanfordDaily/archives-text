# REPORT SHOWS LOWER ABILITY OF J.C. GRADS
## Refutes Former Accounts Of Comparative Abilities Based On Aptitudes 
### 
Students entering Stanford from
junior colleges have a lower average
score in the aptitude examinations
and a lower grade point average for
their first year in the University
than students entering from high
school and other preparatory
j schools, the registrar's report in
cluded in the annual President's
I Report for the year 1929-30 reveals.
This is to a degree, a refutation
of conclusions stated in a report
| issued by the Registrar's Office and
the School of Education three years
ago .... "Their ability, as measured
by the Thorndike Intelligence Test,
is slightly superior to that of stu
dents from four-year colleges, and
; markedly superior to that of stu
; dents who were admitted as fresh
j men." At the time of its publication
! this report gained much publicity
j due to the movement at the time to
eliminate the lower division from
j the University.
The figures contained in the Prcsi
; dent's Report are based on the first
year records of 223 students admit
ted during 1929-30 from 48 different
| junior colleges, and of 508 students
j admitted from 213 high schools. Ac-
I cording to the report, the junior
1 college students had an average test
score of 75.37 as compared with
; 81.97 for the high school students.
In the "percentage satisfactory"
i column of the report, which indi
| cates the proportion of students who
completed work at Stanford with
grades averaging C or better during
their first University year, the aver
, age for junior college entrants was
. 5.7 per cent lower than that of the
I high-school entrants, the averages
being 74.7 per cent and 80.4 per
cent, respectively.
The "grade-point average" used in
; the report is the weighted average
lof the number of quality points
I earned by each student for each
hour of registration. Thus a straight
j A average would be represented by
; 3.00, B by 2.00, and C by 1.00. The
! average grade point rating for jun
; ior college entrants was 1.426 and
for the high-school entrants 1.565.

for the high-school entrants 1.565.
Students entering Stanford from
junior colleges have a lower average
score in the aptitude examinations
and a lower grade point average for
their first year in the University
than students entering from high
school and other preparatory
j schools, the registrar's report in
cluded in the annual President's
I Report for the year 1929-30 reveals.
This is to a degree, a refutation
of conclusions stated in a report
| issued by the Registrar's Office and
the School of Education three years
ago .... "Their ability, as measured
by the Thorndike Intelligence Test,
is slightly superior to that of stu
dents from four-year colleges, and
; markedly superior to that of stu
; dents who were admitted as fresh
j men." At the time of its publication
! this report gained much publicity
j due to the movement at the time to
eliminate the lower division from
j the University.
The figures contained in the Prcsi
; dent's Report are based on the first
year records of 223 students admit
ted during 1929-30 from 48 different
| junior colleges, and of 508 students
j admitted from 213 high schools. Ac-
I cording to the report, the junior
1 college students had an average test
score of 75.37 as compared with
; 81.97 for the high school students.
In the "percentage satisfactory"
i column of the report, which indi
| cates the proportion of students who
completed work at Stanford with
grades averaging C or better during
their first University year, the aver
, age for junior college entrants was
. 5.7 per cent lower than that of the
I high-school entrants, the averages
being 74.7 per cent and 80.4 per
cent, respectively.
The "grade-point average" used in
; the report is the weighted average
lof the number of quality points
I earned by each student for each
hour of registration. Thus a straight
j A average would be represented by
; 3.00, B by 2.00, and C by 1.00. The
! average grade point rating for jun
; ior college entrants was 1.426 and
for the high-school entrants 1.565.
