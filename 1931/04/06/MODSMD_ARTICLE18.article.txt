# CHICAGO MAYOR LOSES G.O.P. AID
## "Big Bill" Thompson Faces Election Defeat 
### 
CHICAGO, April 5. (TP) —All 'indi
cations lead to the belief that Chi
cago will clean house tomorrow. It
is generally accepted that Anton
Cermak, Democratic nominee, will
defeat William Hale Thompson and
that his victory will be so decisive
that he will carry the majority of his
ticket with him. Carefully taken
straw ballots show Cermak to be
the favorite by almost two to one.
Unique Situation
The situation is unique in many
respects. Thompson, nominally a
Republican, deserted his party to
help defeat Ruth Hanna McCormick
and elect Democratic J. Hamilton
Lewis to the United States Senate.
Now the party that placed him in
power is backing Cermak, a Demo
crat.
Tuesday there will apparently be
a reckoning that will leave Thomp
son free to board his yacht and sail
away, something that he threatened
to do if Judge John H. Lyle defeated
him for the party nomination.
Taxpayers Bitter
Powerful Republican organizations
are out in the open working against
Thompson. The taxpayers are bitter
because of the tremendous burden
they are cari'ying and will take a
chance on any candidate with the
feeling that conditions can be bet
tered by a change.
