LOS ANGELES, April 5 (JP). —
Motion pictures are on the upward
trend. The tide is shifting from
"rawness to romance," declared Will
H. Hays on his recent arrival in
Hollywood. The box office—pulse of
the industry—supports the demand
for a higher grade of entertainment.
"The greatest of all censors, the
American public, is beginning to
vote thumbs down on the hard
boiled realism in literature and on
the stage, which marked the post
war period," he stated.
"In recent months," he said, "the
motion picture screen has done
much to debunk the American
gangster. In some films the deadly
weapon of ridicule has been trained
upon tho gangster and his kind—
ridicule that removed from the gun
man every shred of false heroism
that might influence young people."
In other words, the American
public is becoming civilized —no
more of the rough and tumble.
Come on culture!
