# Wilbur Cabinet Position Perhaps Due to Ghosts

Just why President Ray Lyman

knoll is the site of an ancient grave
yard.

their dead in high places, yet not
so high as to incur leg-strain, suc

fornians may have found the gentle

for the saga which students have
built about him.

[man buried his mistress under what
was to be the front stoop of the

presidents. The interment, according j
; to those who claim to know the de- J
