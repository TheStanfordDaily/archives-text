# Club Track Team Gives Cards First Defeat of Season
## Templeton's Men Drop Nine-Point Decision Because Weight Men Perform Below Par, Nisbet Falls In Hurdles, Dyer Stays Out of 220 AEBERSOLD MAKES FINE TIME IN TWO-MILE Clubmen's Unexpected Showing in Half-Mile Blow to Card Hopes; Relay Team Runs 3:18 Mile 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
J|INK TEMPLETON led into the South last Saturday a track and Held
team potentially capable of gathering more than enough points to
defeat the L.A.A.C. stars, yet the Indian team is back on the campus today
with a 70 to 61 defeat on its score sheet. Surprise points, both deserved and
otherwise, registered by the clubmen in the half-mile, 220-yard dash, low
hurdles, and discus tell the disappointing story. As expected, the red
shirted invaders were having things much their own way on the cinder

'j path, with results following prc-
I meet dope until the BSO came along
I to upset the proverbial bucket.
Half-Milers Disappoint
Expecting at least a second place
i in this event, Wright and Cooper,
| both of whom had previously cov-
I cred the distance in slightly under
i 1:58, toed the mark against a couple
of club stars who had not competed
for the Mercuries when the Bears
shut them out in the 880 a week ago.
These gentlemen, Messrs. Jack
Burton and Ferris Webster, came
through to win first and second
places and the eight points which
virtually spelled victory for L.A.A.C.
Dyer Stays Out
Three more unexpected points fell
] into the hands of Boyd Comstock's
j men when Hec Dyer, after winning
] the century in 9.8, did not enter the
j 220, leaving a second to Ken Robin
! son. Les Hables won the event in
j the respectable time of .21.4, some
| thing which Dyer could have dupli
j cated to shove the club flash into a
j third.
An unfortunate fall executed by
I Nesbit as he" was taking the last
I barrier in the lows for a certain
second to Podge Smith a little later
i added three more to the L.A.A.C.
; point column when Maxwell and
j Rockaway breezed by for second
and third places.
Discus Men Fail
The failure of Norm McLeod and
George Grey to place in the discus
was perhaps the biggest upset, con
sidering that Brix and Pickell < f
i L.A.A.C. took second and third with
| tosses of 145 and 143 feet, respec
j tively. Templeton's sensational find,
; Bob Jones, was out in front by aboui
seven feet, while his teammates,
both capable of better than 145, had
a very bad day.
Aebersold's beautiful race in the
I eight-lap grind, when he crossed
j the line but a yard behind Novo of
! the club who stopped the watches
j in 9:42.6, hints of a great battle in
J store when the Indian star faces
| Spud Mossman of California on the
j 18th of this month.

J|INK TEMPLETON led into the South last Saturday a track and Held
team potentially capable of gathering more than enough points to
defeat the L.A.A.C. stars, yet the Indian team is back on the campus today
with a 70 to 61 defeat on its score sheet. Surprise points, both deserved and
otherwise, registered by the clubmen in the half-mile, 220-yard dash, low
hurdles, and discus tell the disappointing story. As expected, the red
shirted invaders were having things much their own way on the cinder

'j path, with results following prc-
I meet dope until the BSO came along
I to upset the proverbial bucket.
Half-Milers Disappoint
Expecting at least a second place
i in this event, Wright and Cooper,
| both of whom had previously cov-
I cred the distance in slightly under
i 1:58, toed the mark against a couple
of club stars who had not competed
for the Mercuries when the Bears
shut them out in the 880 a week ago.
These gentlemen, Messrs. Jack
Burton and Ferris Webster, came
through to win first and second
places and the eight points which
virtually spelled victory for L.A.A.C.
Dyer Stays Out
Three more unexpected points fell
] into the hands of Boyd Comstock's
j men when Hec Dyer, after winning
] the century in 9.8, did not enter the
j 220, leaving a second to Ken Robin
! son. Les Hables won the event in
j the respectable time of .21.4, some
| thing which Dyer could have dupli
j cated to shove the club flash into a
j third.
An unfortunate fall executed by
I Nesbit as he" was taking the last
I barrier in the lows for a certain
second to Podge Smith a little later
i added three more to the L.A.A.C.
; point column when Maxwell and
j Rockaway breezed by for second
and third places.
Discus Men Fail
The failure of Norm McLeod and
George Grey to place in the discus
was perhaps the biggest upset, con
sidering that Brix and Pickell < f
i L.A.A.C. took second and third with
| tosses of 145 and 143 feet, respec
j tively. Templeton's sensational find,
; Bob Jones, was out in front by aboui
seven feet, while his teammates,
both capable of better than 145, had
a very bad day.
Aebersold's beautiful race in the
I eight-lap grind, when he crossed
j the line but a yard behind Novo of
! the club who stopped the watches
j in 9:42.6, hints of a great battle in
J store when the Indian star faces

J|INK TEMPLETON led into the South last Saturday a track and Held
team potentially capable of gathering more than enough points to
defeat the L.A.A.C. stars, yet the Indian team is back on the campus today
with a 70 to 61 defeat on its score sheet. Surprise points, both deserved and
otherwise, registered by the clubmen in the half-mile, 220-yard dash, low
hurdles, and discus tell the disappointing story. As expected, the red
shirted invaders were having things much their own way on the cinder

'j path, with results following prc-
I meet dope until the BSO came along
I to upset the proverbial bucket.
Half-Milers Disappoint
Expecting at least a second place
i in this event, Wright and Cooper,
| both of whom had previously cov-
I cred the distance in slightly under
i 1:58, toed the mark against a couple
of club stars who had not competed
for the Mercuries when the Bears
shut them out in the 880 a week ago.
These gentlemen, Messrs. Jack
Burton and Ferris Webster, came
through to win first and second
places and the eight points which
virtually spelled victory for L.A.A.C.
Dyer Stays Out
Three more unexpected points fell
] into the hands of Boyd Comstock's
j men when Hec Dyer, after winning
] the century in 9.8, did not enter the
j 220, leaving a second to Ken Robin
! son. Les Hables won the event in
j the respectable time of .21.4, some
| thing which Dyer could have dupli
j cated to shove the club flash into a
j third.
An unfortunate fall executed by
I Nesbit as he" was taking the last
I barrier in the lows for a certain
second to Podge Smith a little later
i added three more to the L.A.A.C.
; point column when Maxwell and
j Rockaway breezed by for second
