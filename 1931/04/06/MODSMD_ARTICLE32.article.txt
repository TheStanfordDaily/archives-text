# HAVE THE JUNIOR COLLEGES MET THE TEST?

### 
The question of abolishing the Lower Division, tempo
rarily in the background of campus discussion while Dr.
Wilbur serves in Washington as Secretary of the Interior,
comes to the fore again as one peruses the President's He
port for the academic year 1920 HO. Contained there in
the registrar's report are statistics concerning the relative
scholastic standings of students who entered Stanford di
rect from high schools and those who came here from jun
ior colleges.
As originally conceived and later worked out, the plan
to abolish the lower division at Stanford was made de
pendent on one premise that the junior colleges should
prove an adequate substitute for the tirst two years of uni
versity training. The registrar's report indicates to date
that they have not proven to be such a substitute scholasli
callv.
Figures in the registrar's report are based on the per
formances of 22.') junior college students and f>oB high
school students admitted to the I niversity during H)2o s -HO.
The report shows that the average test score of the high
school students was (i.ti per cent higher than that of the
junior college students admitted, that 5.7 per cent more of
the high school students are doing satisfactory work than
are the junior college students, and finally that those ad
mitted from the junior colleges have a grade point average
of only 1 . 120 as compared with 1. ;">(>;"> for those who came
here direct from high schools.
These figures indicate one thing rather clearly, namely,
that the junior colleges at present do not prepare a student
as well for the work encountered in the third university
year as the high schools prepare him for the freshman
year. I'ntil the time when,- if ever, the junior colleges can
train a student to take up the more advanced university
studies as thoroughly as does the I'nivcrsity now in its first
and second years, there should be no further talk of abol
ishing the Lower Division.
