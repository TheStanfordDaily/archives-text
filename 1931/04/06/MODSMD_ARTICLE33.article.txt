# FOR THE FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Today begins another campaign of Stanford's annual !
Greek war. For three weeks, 21 fraternities will vie with |
each other trying to impress their individual merits on ,
members of the class of '.'VI. Much of the activity of these
three weeks will strike disinterested campus observers as j
comic; but to participants, on the Row and in Kncina, there
will be moments of suspense, and disappointment.
Under Stanford's system of deferred rushing, freshmen I
are not pledged as soon as they set foot on the campus.
They are given two quarters of orientation before being|
faced with the fraternity question. Nevertheless, in the [
emotional stress and excitement of the rushing period, that i
orientation loses much of its effect. To upper-classmen on :
the Row, rushing is not a new experience; to freshmen it is.
it is to the freshmen, then, that The Daily otters this j
counsel:
1. The social democracy and freedom of Stanford re-j
move much of the campus social prestige attached to fra- j
lernities at other universities. Don't feel you should join a j.
fraternity, any fraternity, simpiy to be able to say you are
a fraternity man. Less than a third of Stanford men are I
fraternity members.
2. Remember that living in a fraternity as a rule costs
more than living in a hall. Inquire frankly, as you have
a right to do, about costs of living at the different houses.
Or ask the Dean of Men's Ottice.
You won't see much of the seniors in the fraternity;
assess in your own mind the juniors, and the sophomores
who will be juniors next year. Rut even more important!
are the other freshmen who may join the fraternity with
you; they will be in the house with you longer than anv
others.
Timers and judges ready? They're off!
