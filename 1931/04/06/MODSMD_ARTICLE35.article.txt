One hears considerable talk about j
' making Stanford a genuine co-edu
] cational University by admitting ;
I 2,000 more women. The present ob- j
| slacle to such a plan is in securing
i an additional endowment to cover j
j the increased enrollment. Few seem
to dwell on the abstract advisability' 1
I of such a plan.
Firstly, 2,000 women would com
: pletely alter the Stanford Univer
; sity that is today and the Stanford ,
of yesterday. Of course, it is easy |
1 to say, ''Be modern!—progress." But j
it must not be forgotten that all j
1 change is not progress. Multiplying
the "500" by four would change the j
I Quad into a fashion promenade. The j
freedom and ruggedness of our i
campus would be severely hampered j
: by an engaging coating of whipped
j cream.
The Farm, today, is a man's cam
pus—in spite of the "500." Few will
please. We associate with men. Only I
i seriously deny that. We dress as we
| a select few (and people are se- j
! lected for heaven and hell as well) j
can enjoy the constant company of
I fair co-eds, because by mathemati
j cal study of time and persons, it is
! obvious there are not enough co-eds
' to go around.
Though the rough may be only a
dead tradition to teach unsuspecting
| freshmen, the tradition of a rough
i could only develop on a man's cam
i pus. Stanford may have been a
| "farm," but 2,000 co-eds would cer
i tainly transform it into a dude
j ranch. Encina with its broken win
i dows, water bombs, initialed walls
| and furniture will all pass with the
J adoption of such a proposal.
All these things may be indica
| tive of barbarism; but Stanford is
! slightly uncivilized. It is in its
! roughness, however, wherein its
! charm lies. Its rugged democracy is I

! almost inspiring. That, perhaps,
'sounds like an old wheel horse poli
; lician's Fourth of July plea for the
i dying frontier; but in this day which
i is being dominated by patent leather
pumps, apartment houses, stiff
I shirts, and militant women—it is in
deed a pleasing change to live a
few months on this campus.
! The women themselves should,
| fr.bove everybody else, be opposed to
increasing the number of women
I students. They should realize the
| advantage of being on the short end
jof six to one odds. Their present
[ popularity should not deceive them
;as to their genuine status. Even
! numbers will certainly make it
tough sledding for many residents
| of Roble and Row.
The change will probably come,
however. Some philanthropist will
be forthcoming and the old order
will pass. This University will cease
to be a monument to Leland Stan
' ford Jr.—but to his sister (if he hnd
had one). And when 2,000 women
| charge the happy hunting grounds,
maintained inviolate for the "500"
during these many years, the apois
tles of the old order will gather
around a huge fire and amid loud
1 lamenting, will cast in cords, sweat
shirts, Menlo songs, pictures of im
ports, ancient Fords, and other heri
tages of the golden past.
Then, when the last embers have
cooled, the Stanford of the past will
be dead and the new order will be
, ushered in—Encina will be razed;
I Sequoia will be deserted; Sycamore
Road will be paved; the foothills will
be subdivided; cushioned sofas will
line the Cactus Gardens; and a
bright neon sign will span the new
arches, glaringly proclaiming to the
passing multitudes that they are
now going by "STANFORD UNI
VERSITY—the U.S.C. of the North."

One hears considerable talk about j
' making Stanford a genuine co-edu
] cational University by admitting ;
I 2,000 more women. The present ob- j
| slacle to such a plan is in securing
i an additional endowment to cover j
j the increased enrollment. Few seem
to dwell on the abstract advisability' 1
I of such a plan.
Firstly, 2,000 women would com
: pletely alter the Stanford Univer
; sity that is today and the Stanford ,
of yesterday. Of course, it is easy |
1 to say, ''Be modern!—progress." But j
it must not be forgotten that all j
1 change is not progress. Multiplying
the "500" by four would change the j
I Quad into a fashion promenade. The j
freedom and ruggedness of our i
campus would be severely hampered j
: by an engaging coating of whipped
j cream.
The Farm, today, is a man's cam
pus—in spite of the "500." Few will
please. We associate with men. Only I
i seriously deny that. We dress as we
| a select few (and people are se- j
! lected for heaven and hell as well) j
can enjoy the constant company of
I fair co-eds, because by mathemati
j cal study of time and persons, it is
! obvious there are not enough co-eds
' to go around.
Though the rough may be only a
dead tradition to teach unsuspecting
| freshmen, the tradition of a rough
i could only develop on a man's cam
i pus. Stanford may have been a
| "farm," but 2,000 co-eds would cer
i tainly transform it into a dude
j ranch. Encina with its broken win
i dows, water bombs, initialed walls
| and furniture will all pass with the
J adoption of such a proposal.
All these things may be indica
| tive of barbarism; but Stanford is
! slightly uncivilized. It is in its
! roughness, however, wherein its
! charm lies. Its rugged democracy is I

! almost inspiring. That, perhaps,
'sounds like an old wheel horse poli
; lician's Fourth of July plea for the
i dying frontier; but in this day which
i is being dominated by patent leather
pumps, apartment houses, stiff
I shirts, and militant women—it is in
deed a pleasing change to live a
few months on this campus.
! The women themselves should,
| fr.bove everybody else, be opposed to
increasing the number of women
I students. They should realize the
| advantage of being on the short end
jof six to one odds. Their present
[ popularity should not deceive them
;as to their genuine status. Even
! numbers will certainly make it
tough sledding for many residents
| of Roble and Row.
The change will probably come,
however. Some philanthropist will
be forthcoming and the old order
will pass. This University will cease
to be a monument to Leland Stan
' ford Jr.—but to his sister (if he hnd
had one). And when 2,000 women
| charge the happy hunting grounds,
maintained inviolate for the "500"
during these many years, the apois
tles of the old order will gather
around a huge fire and amid loud
1 lamenting, will cast in cords, sweat
shirts, Menlo songs, pictures of im
ports, ancient Fords, and other heri
tages of the golden past.
Then, when the last embers have
cooled, the Stanford of the past will
be dead and the new order will be
, ushered in—Encina will be razed;
I Sequoia will be deserted; Sycamore
Road will be paved; the foothills will
be subdivided; cushioned sofas will
line the Cactus Gardens; and a
bright neon sign will span the new
arches, glaringly proclaiming to the
passing multitudes that they are
now going by "STANFORD UNI
VERSITY—the U.S.C. of the North."
