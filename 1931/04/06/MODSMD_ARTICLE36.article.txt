# Cabbages and Things

### 
In all the natural history books i
we've ever seen, there's not a single |
picture of our friend the jackrabbit ;
eating anything larger than a car- !
rot. But the public insists that cab- j
bage is included in a well-balanced |
diet. So, a happy Easter, just 24 i
hours late, to all of you, egg-otisti- |
cal or humble.
A mid-western city is experi
menting with a new three-work -
days-a-week plan. At least, they
call it new. We know better.
The popular local plan is much
farther advanced. Just never
start to work, and you don't

regulations.
Men's rushing starts today, with j
its customary ill-concealed boast- j
ing. And what a swell bunch of 1
liars can be px-oduced by a single j
season of fraternity gafT. However, j
it's probably the best thing that ever
hits campus, in a way. Even the j

| most nonchalant of them all are
I raking leaves and left-overs from
! front lawns, to make the world safe
| for idiocy.
