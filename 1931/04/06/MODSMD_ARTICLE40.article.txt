DOCTORS WIVES—At the New !
Stanford Theatre.
This is a picture which has prac
tically everything which counts to
recommend it: a good plot, a splen- I
did cast, smooth fast action, and
clever lines. The acting of Warner j
Baxter is notable—and the pleasure j
in his performance is not at all do- '
tracted from by the fact that he is ;
one of ihe handsomest men on the |
screen.
The so-called siren in the show is !
about its only flaw. This lady is a
blonde. When the "other-woman" j
role is taken by a blonde, it is ab- j
solutely essential that she have |
either an attractive face or an at
tractive figure. This creature has
neither, unfortunately. However,
Joan Bennett, the feminine lead, is .
sufficiently exquisite. By the time
the picture is over, one is fairly
convinced that a doctor is the iast
man in the world for a jealous
woman to marry. —M. L. R.

MEN ON CALL—At the Varsity
Theatre.
Edmund Lowe manages to make
"Men On Call" a fairly interesting
movie, although he has to overcome
a melodramatic and rather improb
able plot. As a member of the Coast

! Guard who has received a disillu
| sioning blow from the girl he loves,
he rescues her from drowning—pure
i coincidence, of course.
The actual work of the coast guard
performing rescues on burning ships,
| giving dances, and so forth, is ex
i citing, but one wonders how reali.-
I tic. Just why the-expected sight of
the train wreck, in the beginning of
the picture, was hidden behind a
i black screen and loud crashes is a
S mystery, unless our sensitive na
tures were to be spared. • —J. N.
