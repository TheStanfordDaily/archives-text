A FLY IN THE SOUP
Spring quarter at Stanford
suggests a lot of pleasant tilings
to every sports-loving tuition
payer. Just mention it to one
of them during the dark, drear
days of some winter quarter,
and observe the look of ethereal
happiness which spreads over
his countenance as he dreams of
sports-heavy week-ends, of
warm, sunny afternoons spent
in the Stadium or hall park,
cracking peanuts to stair into his
mouth between cat calls directed
at the umpire.
To the majority of fans, we say,
that magic word, "spring," brings
thoughts as these. Yet now and then
you might run across one of those
perverse individuals who is continu
ally taking the joy out-of life. Ask
him what this word suggests, and
he will probably answer, "Flies."
Alas, it is true. Flies as well as birds
are attracted to this campus in
spring quarter. And in spite of the
delicious flavor of the sports dish,
one of these winged insects, per
haps of the horse-fly variety, has
made his way into the athletic soup
on the Farm.
Intramural baseball, that
nightmare which annually af
flicts Stanford U., will begin to
morrow afternoon, to drag along
for an entire quarter of horse
hide agony. Every week-day
three or four games will be
scheduled to start about 4
o'clock, and three out of four
of these week-days will find the
mural diamonds deserted at
about 1 o'clock. Day after day
the Daily will contain a small
article saying "So and so de
faulted lo so and so, while dou
ble defaults were recorded in
the other two mural ball games
slated for yesterday."
And let us say that as long as
the regulation hard pellet remains,
intramural ball will continue to be
a sore spot in the side of an other
wise pleasant season of sports. Pleas
for the larger sphere have gone un
heeded this year, though the mural
moguls in announcing that leagues
had been drawn and that the annual
misery would begin tomorrow, add
ed that a special circuit on the side
could be organized for the softies if
enough of them wanted it,.
The reason that big league style
of baseball is a lamentable failure
in the intramural field is obvious.
You, too, probably enjoy the back
lot, soft-ball game, but how do you
enjoy standing up against a fast
pitcher who has that rock-like apple
in his hand and very little control?
And besides, nobody seems to have
the necessary gloves, masks, pads,
etc.
The only reasonable argument
in favor of the present situation
is that mural competition is said
to develop material for Woiter's
varsity nine. We can find only
two men who ever came up via
this route, Vard Loomis and
Art Miller, a pitcher and a
catcher. That is what one might
expect, since the battery usually
monopolizes the exercise in the
intramural pastime. Is this worth
going through the quarter-long
torture similar to last year's,
when no less than 54 scheduled
contests were defaulted, and a
dozen double forfeits recorded?

mouth between cat calls directed
at the umpire.
To the majority of fans, we say,
that magic word, "spring," brings
thoughts as these. Yet now and then
you might run across one of those
perverse individuals who is continu
ally taking the joy out-of life. Ask
him what this word suggests, and
he will probably answer, "Flies."
Alas, it is true. Flies as well as birds
are attracted to this campus in
spring quarter. And in spite of the
delicious flavor of the sports dish,
one of these winged insects, per
haps of the horse-fly variety, has
made his way into the athletic soup
on the Farm.
Intramural baseball, that
nightmare which annually af
flicts Stanford U., will begin to
morrow afternoon, to drag along
for an entire quarter of horse
hide agony. Every week-day
three or four games will be
scheduled to start about 4
o'clock, and three out of four
of these week-days will find the
mural diamonds deserted at
about 1 o'clock. Day after day
the Daily will contain a small
article saying "So and so de
faulted lo so and so, while dou
ble defaults were recorded in
the other two mural ball games
slated for yesterday."
And let us say that as long as
the regulation hard pellet remains,
intramural ball will continue to be
a sore spot in the side of an other
wise pleasant season of sports. Pleas
for the larger sphere have gone un
heeded this year, though the mural
moguls in announcing that leagues
had been drawn and that the annual
misery would begin tomorrow, add
ed that a special circuit on the side
could be organized for the softies if
enough of them wanted it,.
The reason that big league style
of baseball is a lamentable failure
in the intramural field is obvious.
You, too, probably enjoy the back
lot, soft-ball game, but how do you
enjoy standing up against a fast
pitcher who has that rock-like apple
in his hand and very little control?
And besides, nobody seems to have
the necessary gloves, masks, pads,
etc.
The only reasonable argument
in favor of the present situation
is that mural competition is said
to develop material for Woiter's
varsity nine. We can find only
two men who ever came up via
this route, Vard Loomis and
Art Miller, a pitcher and a
catcher. That is what one might
expect, since the battery usually
monopolizes the exercise in the
intramural pastime. Is this worth
going through the quarter-long
torture similar to last year's,
when no less than 54 scheduled
contests were defaulted, and a
dozen double forfeits recorded?

A FLY IN THE SOUP
Spring quarter at Stanford
suggests a lot of pleasant tilings
to every sports-loving tuition
payer. Just mention it to one
of them during the dark, drear
days of some winter quarter,
and observe the look of ethereal
happiness which spreads over
his countenance as he dreams of
sports-heavy week-ends, of
warm, sunny afternoons spent
in the Stadium or hall park,
cracking peanuts to stair into his
mouth between cat calls directed
at the umpire.
