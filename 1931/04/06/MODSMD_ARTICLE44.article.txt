# Card Nine in First Win Over Bears in 4 Years
## VARSITY BOWS TO TROJAN SLUGGERS IN SLOW CONTEST San Francisco University Meets Wolter's Squad At Farm Today 
### Francis Lloyd 
The Horner jinx is broken!
In order to relieve Norm Horner
of his Indian sign on Stanford, as
he was relieved of the Axe, it was
necessary for the Cards to play sen
sational baseball, in which they
were led by the superb pitching of
Dan Johnson who held the Bears to
six hits and two runs while the In
dians were collecting eight hits and
three runs.
Rintala Doubles
Following a pecular habit devel
oped by the Cards this season, Stan
ford collected all its runs after two
were out. The winning run was
scored in the sixth inning after Hun
ken flied out and Delmas was forced
at second on a hit by Campbell. On
the first pitch to Rintala, Campbell
stole second base and was brought
home by a slashing double from
Rintala's bat, with what proved to
be the winning run.
In the second inning after two
were out Campbell doubled and Rin
tala brought him in on a single that
rolled through Mclntyre's legs, al
lowing Rintala to reach'third. Art
Miller then hit a terrific fly ball to
deep center which was good for
three bases and scored Rintala. Cali
fornia put on a dangerous rally in
their half of the second which netted
them two runs to knot the count.

Weak Pitching

Wilhout pitching no team can win
a baseball game. This old adage was
clearly illustrated on Friday when
U.S.C. walked around the bases i
enough times to defeat Stanford 12 ;
to 6. The only pleasant thing about
the whole afternoon was the way
in which the Indians kept on trying j
to make up the disheartening lead to ■
the very last.
Today Stanford will meet San
Francisco University for the first >
time here on the Farm at' 3:15 !
o'clock. Although given little chance !
to win, the city outfit will be dan
gerous unless a pitcher can be found
on the Stanford squad who can get
the ball over the plate. Frank Milsap !
will probably start for the Indians
on the mound.
