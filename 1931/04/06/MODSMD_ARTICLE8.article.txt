# A 						CAPELLA CHORUS PRESENTS PROGRAM OF PASSION MUSIC
## 
### 
Emphasizing songs composed by
Tschaikowsky, Palestrina, Rossini,
and Saint-Saens, the A Capella
Choir of the University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles, under the di
rection of Squire Coop, gave a de
vout and dignified interpretation of
Passion music, most of which was in
Latin, in the Memorial Church Fri
day. The Latin motets of the six
teenth century were perhaps the
most fifiished of the group.

Some of the other periods in
church development were repre
sented in the German "Nature's
Adoration," by Beethoven, Tschai
kowsky's "Legend," and Gibbon's
"Almighty and Everlasting God."
Saint-Saens' "Tolite Hostias," which
came at the end of the program,
climaxed the whole program with
its magnitude.
