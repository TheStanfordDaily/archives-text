### 
WASHINGTON, April 5 (/P>. â€” j
Universal peace was held today by j
Paul C. Wolman, commander in
chief of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, to be dependent upon world
wide acceptance of a plan to draft j
capital, industry, and manpower in
future wars.
"Until a more practical method of
coping with oppression than war
fare is found," he said, in a state
ment, "there appears to be little
hope for perpetual world peace.
"However, there is always the
possibility of confining international
conflicts to a minimum if the econ
nomic profits of warfare can be
eliminated beforehand."
