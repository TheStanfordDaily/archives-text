# TROOPS SENT TO SUPPRESS NEW REVOLT
## Cavalry Regiment Refuses To Embark; Madeiran Rebels In Command 
### 
LISBON, Portugal, April 6. (>P) —
Every seaworthy ship in the Portu
guese navy is being hurried to Fun
chal, Madeira, with troops to put
down the military revolt which
broke out there on Saturday night.
The first detachment of soldiers
went out today in a destroyer and
cruiser; the gunboat Saira is sail
ing tonight, and the old iron-clad
Vasco Da Gama sails tomorrow.
Cavalry Mutinies
The fifth light cavalry refused to
embark for service in Madeira to
day, and their officers ordered the
men back to barracks. The seventh
regiment took their place.
While the Portuguese government
was rushing soldiers, light artillery,
and airplanes to combat the revolt,
official circles today were studying
reports of fighting on the island be
tween rebels and loyalists. Although
official reports were lacking, it was
believed both sides had suffered
casualties.
Loyaltists Defeated
One account was that the loyalists
had been defeated in the first clash
and their leader captured. Colonel
Cabacada, Civil Governor of Fun
chal, was said to have led the attack
against the insurgents.
Meanwhile the central Govern
ment has declared martial law
throughout Madeira, although for
eign diplomats in Lisbon were won
dering how this could be enforced
at present.
Artillery Sails
Two batteries of light artillery
and 600 men from the Lisbon gar
rison sailed for Madeira on the
transport Pedro Gomez today. They
are due in Madeira Wednesday.
There was speculation here tonight
as to whether these forces will be
permitted to land when they reach
the island. The insurgents are known
to be provided with ample arms and
ammunition, and it is believed the
government flotilla would be un
willing to fire upon the rebel posi
tion in fear of damaging foreign
property or life.
