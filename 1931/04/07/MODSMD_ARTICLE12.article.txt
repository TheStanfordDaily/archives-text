### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, April 6
(/P). â€”With the most pressing relief
work out of the way, business men
of Managua took stock today of their
material losses from earthquake and
fire.
Francisco Bunge, German consul,
said many merchants had been
alarmed by a reported cable to one
insurance representative to the ef
fect that insurance on damage from
the quake would not be paid.
"This report has circulated like
wildfire," he said, "and many mer
chants, worried over their personal
and material losses, arc frantic. I
feel absolutely sure that no fires
intentionally were started, to gain
insurance."
The agent of one British insur
ance company said his firm would
honor all policies, because it car
ried special earthquake* clauses.
