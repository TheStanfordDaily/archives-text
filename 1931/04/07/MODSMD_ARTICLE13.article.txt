# MARIONETTES TO BE AIDED BY TOM-TOM
## Drums Are Background For West Indian Negro Play By O'Neill 
### 
West Indian tom-toms will form
the ominous background for Ralph
Chesse's marionette production of
Eugene O'Neill's negro play, "Em
peror Janes," tomorrow evening in
the Assembly hall. The puppet
show is being sponsored by the
Women's Gym committee, under the
chairmanship of Jane Snyder. All
proceeds are to go to the furnishing
fund of the new Women's Gym
which will be dedicated on April 17.
Vachel Lindsay's negro poem,
"Congo," will be given as a pro
logue, preparing the audience for
the atmosphere of the play proper.
The tom-toms form a rhythmic ac
companiment for the entire play,
continuing throughout the eight
scenes, rising and falling with the
action.
Lighting, and off-stage noises have
been so planned by Chesse, who
works alone, as to produce a stirring
effect as fears and hallucinations
continually pass in the mind of the
colored porter, Emperor Jones.
John Carter Ford, who will read
the part of Smithers, the only white
man in the cast, assists Chesse, who
reads the lines of Jones and serves
as general manager and executor.
Chesse is a prominent producer in
the city, giving regular performances
at the Fairmount Hotel.
Tickets are on sale for seventy
five and fifty cents at the Union and
at David Keebles' in Palo Alto.
