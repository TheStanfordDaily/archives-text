Gorman Is Owner
Such is the record of the Palo
1 Alto Airport and School of Aviation,
according to A. W. Gorman, former
, San Francisco stock broker, and
I now owner and manager of this air
school on the Stanford campus.
Asked what he thought of the fu
ture of aviation, Gorman said, "Fly
ing must be taken out of the hero
role, and made a business. The
failure of many air companies is due
| to having excellent aviators sitting
behind desks instead of having
trained business executives. Avia
i tion will become successful when
the public becomes air-minded and
mass-production ideas can be used.
Future of Aviation
"With the new chain-store system
j of business, quick transportation is

necessary and airplanes will soon ;
|be universally utilized. 1 have no
doubt that flights over the oceans
! will be common in a few years.
"The unfortunate Knute Rockne
! accident was an act of God. Five I
fatal auto accidents in San Fran-
I cisco the same day received no pub
| licity. The history of accidents!
shows that 90 per cent are due to
| carelessness or faulty equipment. It j
takes only three weeks to build a J
! plane, but sometimes it takes anj
additional four months to satisfy the j
Department of Commerce inspec
tors. This is a marvelous protec
tive feature."
25 Student Fliers
There are more possible flying
, hours in this neighborhood than i
near any other flying port in the J
Bay Cities region, Gorman said.
Stanford students who arc taking |
advantage of the proximity of the
i Palo Alto Flying School to secure |
! piolts' licenses included 23 men and [
two women, Janet Briggs and Nancy i
Overton.
The head of the school pointed
out that the public has the utmost !
confidence in aviation. He cited the
i example of the rush of investors to
i buy stock in the Seaboard Air Line, '
I an eastern railroad, under the im- !
j pression that it was an air company. |
