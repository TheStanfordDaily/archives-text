# DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER WANTS MORE DEFINITE PLATFORM
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 6. (TP) -
, Another suggestion that Democrats
! avoid straddling and adopt a defi
nite 1932 platform on controversial
I subjects — including prohibition —
was before that party today in a
; letter from Chairman Raskob of the
i national committee.
! He asked each national commit-
I teeman to make individual recom
i mendations for the 1932 platform
and give "particular" attention to
j prohibition.
Once more he advanced his home
I rule plan as what he believes to be
| a solution of liquor questions. Then,
I answering accusations that he was
attempting to dictate to the party,
he recalled that the last Democratic
: convention charged the national
committee of which he is chairman
with making "recommendations of
policies or procedure for the con
sideration of the convention."
1 The voters, he asserted, will sup
port the party "whose policies and
conduct appeal to them as being
sincere, honest, courageous, best
| guaranteeing the preservation of our
I democracy and promoting freedom
i and happiness as against a life of
1 tyranny and strife."
