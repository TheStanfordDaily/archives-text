### 
BROOKLANDS, Eng., April 6. (/P)
—Sir Malcolm Campbell, world's
motor car speed king, looked death
in the eye for a few seconds today
while an almost unmanageable rac
ing car carried him along the steeply
banked track at Brooklands at 100
miles an hour.
Competing in a handicap event at
the opening day of racing on the
Brooklands Auto Racing Club pro
gram, Sir Malcolm was just com
pleting the first lap of a 12-mile
race when the rod holding the front
wheels in position broke. As the
spectators lining both sides of the
track gasped in horror, Sir Malcolm
fought the careening car along the
steeply banked track as the other
competitors roared past, and brought
it to a halt without mishap. If the
car had gone off the track it prob
ably would have meant death both
to himself and many spectators.
