# CARDS TROUNCE GRAY FOG 10-6 IN SLOPPY TILT
## Harry Wolter's Men Even Count In Sixth; Dan Johnson Finishes LOOMIS PITCHES WELL S.F.U. Has No Earned Runs, Getting Nine Passes 
### Francis Lloyd 
Our altruism becomes a bit trying
■ when we present our opponents with
six runs in the first three innings
and then spend the rest of the after
noon overcoming this'weighty lead.
I Yet this is exactly what happened
yesterday when the Indians de
feated San Francisco University,
10-6.
Without getting a single earned
run, and committing four errors,
i the Gray Fog outfit were a constant
worry up to the seventh inning
when Stanford, after showing that
never-say-die spirit, finally tied the
score at six all. Vard Loomis, the
third Card chucker, who pitched five
scoreless innings, was given credit
for the victory.
Johnson Stars
After keeping the Golden Bear
i under control on Saturday, Dun
Johnson finished up the last two
innings for the Indians in his usual
| brilliant fashion. The more they
play, the more Delmas and Dykes
Johnson give evidence of being the
best combination in the league. Al
though hitless in the last few games
Spud Hardy has been very steady
j at first base, making many fine
' stops.
In all, the Indians collected ten
hits off the deliveries of Huntley
and Thompson, Rintala leading with
two out of three. Dykes Johnson,
Philippi, and Delmas each got two
i hits apiece on four tries. Vince
Philippi gave several exhibitions of
clever broken field running to steal
; three sacks.
Title-In View
By winning all the remaining
games on the schedule Stanford can
J win the conference title. However,
with this in mind it is just as im
iportant to win the mid-week games
as it is to defeat California. There
can be no let up if the new diamond
is to be dedicated with a pennant.
While Stanford has to meet Cali-
I fornia two more times, San Fran
| cisco University two more times, and
U.C.L.A. once, the Bears have only i
U.C.L.A. to encounter besides the ;
> two games with the Indians in the !
local ball park.
On the trip to Berkeley last Sat- {
: urday, the bus driver of the Indians '
! took a couple of "thank-you-mams"
j pretty fast so that those in the back j
seat came into sudden and uncom- j
i fortable contact with the roof of the j
Cards' modest conveyance. For j
I some reason everyone seemed to
j consider the whole incident as ex- \
| tremely amusing—except those in j
! the rear seat.

Our altruism becomes a bit trying
■ when we present our opponents with
six runs in the first three innings
and then spend the rest of the after
noon overcoming this'weighty lead.
I Yet this is exactly what happened
yesterday when the Indians de
feated San Francisco University,
10-6.
Without getting a single earned
run, and committing four errors,
i the Gray Fog outfit were a constant
worry up to the seventh inning
when Stanford, after showing that
never-say-die spirit, finally tied the
score at six all. Vard Loomis, the
third Card chucker, who pitched five
scoreless innings, was given credit
for the victory.
Johnson Stars
After keeping the Golden Bear
i under control on Saturday, Dun
Johnson finished up the last two
innings for the Indians in his usual
| brilliant fashion. The more they
play, the more Delmas and Dykes
Johnson give evidence of being the
best combination in the league. Al
though hitless in the last few games
Spud Hardy has been very steady
j at first base, making many fine
' stops.
In all, the Indians collected ten
hits off the deliveries of Huntley
and Thompson, Rintala leading with
two out of three. Dykes Johnson,
Philippi, and Delmas each got two
i hits apiece on four tries. Vince
Philippi gave several exhibitions of
clever broken field running to steal
; three sacks.
Title-In View
By winning all the remaining
games on the schedule Stanford can
J win the conference title. However,
with this in mind it is just as im
iportant to win the mid-week games
as it is to defeat California. There
can be no let up if the new diamond
is to be dedicated with a pennant.

Our altruism becomes a bit trying
■ when we present our opponents with
six runs in the first three innings
and then spend the rest of the after
noon overcoming this'weighty lead.
I Yet this is exactly what happened
yesterday when the Indians de
feated San Francisco University,
10-6.
Without getting a single earned
run, and committing four errors,
i the Gray Fog outfit were a constant
worry up to the seventh inning
when Stanford, after showing that
never-say-die spirit, finally tied the
score at six all. Vard Loomis, the
third Card chucker, who pitched five
scoreless innings, was given credit
for the victory.
Johnson Stars
After keeping the Golden Bear
i under control on Saturday, Dun
Johnson finished up the last two
innings for the Indians in his usual
| brilliant fashion. The more they
play, the more Delmas and Dykes
Johnson give evidence of being the
best combination in the league. Al
though hitless in the last few games
Spud Hardy has been very steady
j at first base, making many fine
' stops.
In all, the Indians collected ten
hits off the deliveries of Huntley
and Thompson, Rintala leading with
two out of three. Dykes Johnson,
Philippi, and Delmas each got two
i hits apiece on four tries. Vince
Philippi gave several exhibitions of
clever broken field running to steal
; three sacks.
Title-In View
By winning all the remaining
games on the schedule Stanford can
J win the conference title. However,
with this in mind it is just as im
iportant to win the mid-week games
as it is to defeat California. There
can be no let up if the new diamond
is to be dedicated with a pennant.
While Stanford has to meet Cali-
I fornia two more times, San Fran
| cisco University two more times, and
U.C.L.A. once, the Bears have only i
U.C.L.A. to encounter besides the ;
> two games with the Indians in the !
local ball park.
On the trip to Berkeley last Sat- {
: urday, the bus driver of the Indians '
! took a couple of "thank-you-mams"
j pretty fast so that those in the back j
seat came into sudden and uncom- j
i fortable contact with the roof of the j
Cards' modest conveyance. For j
I some reason everyone seemed to
j consider the whole incident as ex- \
| tremely amusing—except those in j
! the rear seat.
