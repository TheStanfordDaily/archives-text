# THE 						HANDWRITING ON THE WALL?
## 
### 
Springing from 110 one knows where, a rumor lo (lie
(â– fleet Hint Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur had resigned, or was
contemplating resigning from Ins post as prcsident-on
leave of Stanford 1 Diversity, reared its fiead on the cam
pus last week and was immediately and firmly squashed
bv word from those "in the know" at Washington and
here.
The rumor, besides meeting with immediate and vehe
ment denial, could not be traced to any one source, but the
tact remains that the subject to which it refers is still a
much-discussed one, and one as far from being solved as it
was when first brought up. The rumor revives the old
question: can one man hold two positions and do justice
to both of them? Ostensibly and by action of the Board of
trustees, Dr. Wilbur is now occupying only one position,
that of Secretary of the Interior, and has no voice in the
conduct of University affairs. Yet Acting President Swain,
in his report for the year intimated that problems
of I niversity policy were submitted to Dr. Wilbur and re
ceived his approval before being put into action.
This arrangement, however harmless it may be, seems
unnecessary. The rumor, groundless though it may be,
cannot be dismissed lightly. Possibly the handwriting is
on the wall, and perhaps the time will soon come when
the parties concerned must recognize it.
