# THE 						UNIVERSITY OF UTOPIA
## 
### 
President Robert Mavnard Mutchins of the University
of Chicago discusses "The I'niversitv of Utopia" in the
current issue of the Yale Review. Dr. IJutehins considers
the relation of higher education and practical social prob
lems. One of the questions he raises, in connection with
Ihe larger and larger lax expenditure for education, is
whether it would not be better "to buy food with this money
than to continue the expansion of a process that seems
powerless to help us in time of need."
I lis own answer to this question is "that the remedy of
our present ills and Ihe only hope we have of preventing
their recurrence is not less education but more." Dr.
Hutchins presents lour needs of contemporary education.
First, for any radical improvement more money is neces
sary. Second, academic freedom must be extended through
wider integration of fields of knowledge. Third, a more
intensive and thorough study of human problems must be
based on this liberal foundation of scholarship. And (lie
results of scholarship and study must be disseminated to a
greater advantage by means of extension education of
adults.
To Ihe Ddihj I'rineelonian, Ihe program is a good one,
but the editor of that paper wonders whether mass educa
tion through extension institutes is "Ihe best and most ef
fective means of disseminating Ihe results of investigations
into human problems."
The Daily believes that mass education is not Ihe work
of universities. Mass education is important, highly im
portant, but it belongs to other agencies. Too many indi
viduals are now wasting resources of time, money, and
energy in colleges and universities of Ibis country. Higher
education cannot be mass production.
Concludes the Daily Princetonian:
"Educational institutions will prove their value to man
kind in time of need, nol when they have succeeded in
scattering a few crumbs of wisdom 011 everyone's door
step, but when they have sent out, from their own walls,
intelligent leaders who are prepared to cope with the prac
tical problems of society and who are ready to lead others
to the solution. The American university is still faced with
the problem of developing intellectual leadership among
its enrolled undergraduates. "When it has done that, it
may turn to increasing ils audience."
