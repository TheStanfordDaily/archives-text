### 
After ;ill those years of almost continual defeat, Stan- j
ford can now boast of a victorious baseball team, a team 1
that has won the majority of its conference panics this sea
son and is a title contender. It's been a long time since the
varsity diamond was the scene of Indian victories in con
ference games, and the spectacle of a Stanford nine tri
umphing consistently is a pleasing one.
And, best of all, the Stanford rough is proving that he
will support campus baseball when he has a team that is
worth backing. More and more spectators are" turning out
for the games, and, if increased attendance is a fair cri
terion, baseball on the Farm is most certainly coming into
its own.
The editorial staff will meet in the Daily office at 1:10
