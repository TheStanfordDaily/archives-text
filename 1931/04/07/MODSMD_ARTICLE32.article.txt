A publicist, preachor, or "success- j
story" business man has not really 1
"arrived"—cannot claim his spurs
until he has condemned modern col- !
lege education in some of its phases, j
We in college (us college boys) are j
very apt to give an all-inclusive |
sneer for all these criticisms; but 1
scoffing does not decrease their
validity if they do have any truth
in them.
The most striking condemnation is !
that college graduates are not edu- !
cated. There is considerable truth in !
such an assertion despite the fact
that colleges are continually placing >
more books in their libraries, more
classrooms in their buildings, more ;
professors in the classrooms, and j
bigger and better stadiums on their J
campuses.
The causes for an uneducated i
graduate in the midst of wonderful 1
opportunities are primarily two. In
the first place, the student often
comes to college with the wrong j
purpose in mind. He may come to a |
liberal arts college in the endeavor j
to directly aid his profession. In so !
doing, he often loses the distinct !
value of a so-called cultural educa- |
tion. Those conscientious freshmen !
v/ho seek to judge the value of every j
course as to its probable advantage
in the practice of law, for example,
are prostituting their education.
Secondly, those students who do
some to these sacred halls of wis- j
dom with the right purpose often j
are at a loss as to which courses I
will best aid this purpose. Too often j
the serious student either sticks to
the limited fields that interest hirn; |
or in a mad effort to cram in cul- |
ture as efficiently as possible,
aimlessly from department to de
partment and from isolated course i
to isolated course. Nothing is quite |
so pitiful as a student signing up [

for every course that promises to be
elevating.
Now, having painted a dismal pic
ture of a college full of students
with the wrong educational aims and
others with the right aims unable
to realize them, we come for the
magic reform that at on sweep of
the pen is to remedy the evils and
make cultured aristocrats out of
everybody.
The reform is simply that the ad
ministration shall fix the programs
of students. The system of require
ments shall be increased. It is as
sumed that there are certain recog
nized fundamental aims for educa
tion; the administration will seek to
realize these aims by prescribing
what courses the student shall take.
A student will be allowed to de
termine his major field of interest;
after that, his academic fate will be
officially sealed by his department.
This is cruel and places a low
estimate on the student's intelligence
—but we feel it would tend to make
more educated college men. True,
you can lead a college student to
good courses, but you can't make
him imbibe; but, if exposed to the
right courses, a little educational
spray from the educational trough
may soak in. In order that students
can satisfy those irresistible inward
cravings for certain special subjects
that would not be supplied by their
directed schedule, we would allow
the last two quarters of the four
years devoted exclusively to elective
work. *
In this way, drifting would be
abolished, direction would be se
cured, and education would be
lifted to a plane wherein the edu
cation would be lifted to a plane
wherein the educated college gradu
ate would not be a rare phenome
non. —Abe Mellinkoff.

professors in the classrooms, and j
bigger and better stadiums on their J
campuses.
The causes for an uneducated i
graduate in the midst of wonderful 1
opportunities are primarily two. In
the first place, the student often
comes to college with the wrong j
purpose in mind. He may come to a |
liberal arts college in the endeavor j
to directly aid his profession. In so !
doing, he often loses the distinct !
value of a so-called cultural educa- |
tion. Those conscientious freshmen !
v/ho seek to judge the value of every j
course as to its probable advantage
in the practice of law, for example,
are prostituting their education.
Secondly, those students who do
some to these sacred halls of wis- j
dom with the right purpose often j
are at a loss as to which courses I
will best aid this purpose. Too often j
the serious student either sticks to
the limited fields that interest hirn; |
or in a mad effort to cram in cul- |
ture as efficiently as possible,
aimlessly from department to de
partment and from isolated course i
to isolated course. Nothing is quite |
so pitiful as a student signing up [

for every course that promises to be
elevating.
Now, having painted a dismal pic
ture of a college full of students
with the wrong educational aims and
others with the right aims unable
to realize them, we come for the
magic reform that at on sweep of
the pen is to remedy the evils and
make cultured aristocrats out of
everybody.
The reform is simply that the ad
ministration shall fix the programs
of students. The system of require
ments shall be increased. It is as
sumed that there are certain recog
nized fundamental aims for educa
tion; the administration will seek to
realize these aims by prescribing
what courses the student shall take.
A student will be allowed to de
termine his major field of interest;
after that, his academic fate will be
officially sealed by his department.
This is cruel and places a low
estimate on the student's intelligence
—but we feel it would tend to make
more educated college men. True,
you can lead a college student to
good courses, but you can't make
him imbibe; but, if exposed to the
right courses, a little educational
spray from the educational trough
may soak in. In order that students
can satisfy those irresistible inward
cravings for certain special subjects
that would not be supplied by their
directed schedule, we would allow
the last two quarters of the four
years devoted exclusively to elective
work. *
In this way, drifting would be
abolished, direction would be se
cured, and education would be
lifted to a plane wherein the edu
cation would be lifted to a plane
wherein the educated college gradu
ate would not be a rare phenome
non. —Abe Mellinkoff.
A publicist, preachor, or "success- j
story" business man has not really 1
"arrived"—cannot claim his spurs
until he has condemned modern col- !
lege education in some of its phases, j
We in college (us college boys) are j
very apt to give an all-inclusive |
sneer for all these criticisms; but 1
scoffing does not decrease their
validity if they do have any truth
in them.
The most striking condemnation is !
that college graduates are not edu- !
cated. There is considerable truth in !
such an assertion despite the fact
that colleges are continually placing >
more books in their libraries, more
classrooms in their buildings, more ;
professors in the classrooms, and j
