A trifle late, and likely to get a
dirty look from ye sports editor, but
we simply must say a few more
words on what happened over the
v/eek-end in an athletic way. From
an almost authoriative source—our
secret operative Number 0126 A—we
have it that a certain freshman track
coach nearly swallowed his cigar as
he watched one of his boys throw
the discus for the first time and
almost heave it out of the stadium.
The same amateur plate-tos
ser did practically nothing all
Saturday morning while those
simply darling boys from San
Jose State were cluttering up
the greensward. Nothing, that
is, but win a couple of events,
and take places in a couple of
others. (Note: Men's rushing
began yesterday.)
Incidentally, the spirit of Chris
tian charity so evident on Good Fri
day extended to the Stanford pitch
ing staff, who gave until it hurt—
the rooting section.
That game against our friendly
rivals from the South revealed that
a certain pai'ty who ploys football
in the fall and baseball in the spring,
and is a very large guy, has flat

I feet. Maybe his shoes were too
tight—maybe.
And then there is the sad, sad
case of the visiting U.S.C. golf
ers, who came up here to com
pete in the intercollegiate tour
ney last week-end. The day he
fore the tournament two prom
inent members of the Stanford
golf team offered to play the
course with the sons of Troy,
"just to point out the tough
spots and show you fellows
what to expect, you know." They
played eighteen holes and the
local prides got an awful shel
lacking. Such, Rollo, is life.

Somewhere in that last paragraph
there ought to be a moral, but un
fortunately, the visiting firemen
couldn't get to first base in the ac
tual tournament, while our boys
breezed through to victory. Heigh
ho! and a bucket of suds.

retary of state here.
A trifle late, and likely to get a
dirty look from ye sports editor, but
we simply must say a few more
words on what happened over the
v/eek-end in an athletic way. From
an almost authoriative source—our
secret operative Number 0126 A—we
have it that a certain freshman track
coach nearly swallowed his cigar as
he watched one of his boys throw
the discus for the first time and
almost heave it out of the stadium.
The same amateur plate-tos
ser did practically nothing all
Saturday morning while those
simply darling boys from San
Jose State were cluttering up
the greensward. Nothing, that
is, but win a couple of events,
and take places in a couple of
others. (Note: Men's rushing
began yesterday.)
Incidentally, the spirit of Chris
tian charity so evident on Good Fri
day extended to the Stanford pitch
ing staff, who gave until it hurt—
the rooting section.
That game against our friendly
rivals from the South revealed that
a certain pai'ty who ploys football
in the fall and baseball in the spring,
and is a very large guy, has flat

I feet. Maybe his shoes were too
tight—maybe.
And then there is the sad, sad
case of the visiting U.S.C. golf
ers, who came up here to com
pete in the intercollegiate tour
ney last week-end. The day he
fore the tournament two prom
inent members of the Stanford
golf team offered to play the
course with the sons of Troy,
"just to point out the tough
spots and show you fellows
what to expect, you know." They
played eighteen holes and the
local prides got an awful shel
lacking. Such, Rollo, is life.

Somewhere in that last paragraph
there ought to be a moral, but un
fortunately, the visiting firemen
couldn't get to first base in the ac
tual tournament, while our boys
breezed through to victory. Heigh
ho! and a bucket of suds.
