THE BOOK SHOW, SPRING, 1931.
Published by the Hook Show, New
York. (At the Palo Alto Hook
Shop.)
Here is the latest in high-powered
salesmanship, advertising, or what
have you. Those of you who have
that guilty feeling when you browse
over books in a book shop and the
salesman gives you a suspicious look
will welcome this book.
The publisher of each of 21 new
books presents an interesting per
sonal note about its author, and then
a chapter or a series of extracts
j from his book.
A good system, but the publishers
! seem to have picked out the most
1 risque bits in each book relying on
the age-old theory of the power of
sex-appeal in advertising.
The scheme is to sell the Book
Show for $2.00 and give the buyer
a 25-cent discount on all books that
he buys as a result of reading the
reviews.
It really is a fine opportunity to
: discover the style, the characters,
I and the type of action of novels be
fore buying them, instead of having
to go by gaudy covers, and bindings,
j and the sketchy and uncertain ex
| tracts from reviews, with which
| publishers sprinkle their advertise
ments. S. C. A.
THE ROOF. By John Galsworthy.
Duckworth, London. 1930.
Foregoing the impassioned cru
j sading spirit, so evident in such
j dramas as "The Silver Box" and
"Justice," the author contents him
: self with working severat situations
; to a common climax, in which true
character values reveal themselves.
The play, thus, is not just fresh from
Galsworthy's pen, but his handling
of it is interesting.
Several young gentlemen, trying
I to unearth life in a little Parisian
.hotel, set fire to the place while'in
! ecstatic practical joking mood. As
j the fire mounts to the upper floors
; the guests seek the roof for safety.
; Galsworthy remains one of the
J few authors, incidentally, able to
| make precocious stage children

bearable. It is rather a pity he didn't
round out the character of Froba,
and omit nine-tenths of the philo
sophic wanderings of waiter Gus
tave. _j. s. S.
A WOMAN ON HER WAY. By John
Van Druten. A. A. Knopf. 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Hook Shop.)
The futility of sophistication, even
though it be prompted by a gallant
refusal to lie down under tragedy,
is John Van Druten's admirably
presented theme.
His heroine is Elinor Johnson,
successful novelist, who so con
ducted her life, that so long as she
caused no injury to others, she was
utterly independent and fearless, no
matter how much gossip she might
provide for her too interested
friends. After twenty years of self
sufficiency, a small part of which
is covered in the novel, and gossip
proves too threatening, and she re
treats, seeking some symbol of staid
convention for security.
John Van Druten has an unusual
ly fine characterization, around
; which he has blended pathos, hu
' mor, and satire artistically. It is
J realism, of a fine type. Were it not
for an unfortunate over-devotion of
! space and time to the lives of other
I characters, "A Woman On Her Way"
might find itself on the shelf labelled
j "great novels." â€”J. N.
