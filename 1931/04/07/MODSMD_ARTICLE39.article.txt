Subtle insinuations about two
famous track coaches have been
beard recently in Farm sports
circles. It seems tbat some of
the more outspoken fans have
dared to accuse Mister Dean
Cromwell and Mister Robert L.
Templeton of playing games!
This game, say these gossipers,
centers around a certain track
meet to be held in the Stanford
Stadium on May 2.

The originators of tlii.s slander, if
;oked up in Who's Who, could eas
y be; identified as those greedy
juls who wanted to defeat the Los
.ngeles Athletic Club last Saturday,
nd were terribly disappointed at
le outcome. "Dink could have won
uit meet," they say, and then pro
ved to accuse Mr. Templeton of
> .si rig, with malice aforethought,
lat dual affair in the enemy terri
>ry for the sole purpose of fooling
Ir. Cromwell.

Wo can just see Kobert L.
giving his boys instructions on
the train en route lo the South.
Perhaps it was something like
ibis: "Boys, I want you to go in
there and drop this meet by
about eight points. I know it
might lie hard to stay behind
soj.io of these ageing clubmen,
but we gotta do it." Mr. Crom
well, after seeing the Indians
beaten, probably turned out at
Bovard field where the Trojans
practice, with this encouraging
news: "Don't overwork, fellows,
we can't lose lo Stanford."
Well, maybe that's exaggerated a
it, but there may be a vestige of
uth in this gossip. Not that Dink
id not want to win, but it is cvi
ent that he didn't intend to ex
:iust his supply of possible points
i come out on top. Had he been
.■etiy concerned about the out
cries Saturday, you probably would
ive seen liec Dyer running the 220
. spite tiie slightly strained muscle
? suffered while negotiating a 9.3
•ntury. That would have shut Ken
obinson or the club out of a second
-r! changed the final score to 67-64
i favor of L.A.A.C.
Then Ben Eastman would have
stayed out of the 440. where the
Redshirts took an easy sweep,
and run the 880 for a first in
something under 1:55. Since the
Southerners took the first two
places in this event with 1:56,
this shift would have reversed
th.; final score to 68-63 in favor
of Stanford. The discus tossers,
Norm McLeod and George Grey,
could have placed in close order
behind Boh Jones's Avinning
throw had they concentrated
more thoroughly on so doing, to
sew the affair into a decidedly
red bag.

Whether or not Mr. Templeton is
ying to fool Mr. Cromwell, the
eet was lost anu the Indian track
en are back at the Farm work ins)
v their next opponent, the Golden
3ar, in the Big Meet. Except for
rick Morse's humorous doping fea
ed in the columns of the Call
ulletin, no one seems to be able to
i up a sweat about the traditional
ash. The eternal tiangle of sports
this state is still unbalanced on
v track, but the Bears are justified
predicting for this year the best
g Meet in quite some time.
The mile and two-mile, Califor
a's big early season hope against
•mpleton's aggregation, seem 10 be
.sorting the Bear cause by reason
the remarkable improvement of
-o Indian distance runners. Bob
•own, taking second in the mile
iturday, was timed in 4:29. Later
was found that the distance was a
ile plus ten yards, which means
at Bob ran something like 4:25.
Some of those who saw the
meet think that the sensational
time in the mile was really
Paul Aebersold's, and not
Elmo's, the clubman who was
given first place. At any rate,
it was practically a dead heat,
indicating that Spud Mossnian
f»«' California will have to better
his 9:47 or he satisfied with a
second to Aehersold on the 18th.
