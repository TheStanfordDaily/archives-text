# Stanford Takes State Collegiate Golf Title
## HIGH HONORS WON BY MACNAUGHTON ON LOCAL COURSE Northern California Title Holder Defeated By I Over Par Score 
### 
Malcolm MacNaughton, perhaps
the best of Stanford's great golfing
legion, won the California intercol
legiate title by beating Herb Schultz,
Bear representative, 0 and 5, yester
day on the University course.
His victory gave Stanford a clean
sweep of the honors of the minor
sports carnival golf competition,
since the Indians had already taken
the team title by 23 strokes and
qualified four men for the individual
championship.
Schultz Battles
Schultz, present holder of the
Northern California title, was no
match for the steady stream of pars
that swept off MacNaughton's clubs.
He did put up a fine battle in the
morning round, being only one
down at the end of the first eighteen,
after losing the first two holes of
the match to his opponent's two
birdies.
Medal scores for the first eighteen
were MacNaughton, 73, Schultz, 74.
Bearing down in the afternoon,
MacNaughton picked up three holes
on the first nine and two more on
the second to end the match on the
32nd green with a 6 and 5 victory.
At the time when the match ended
he was one over par for 32 holes.
Heatley Downed
In reaching the finals MacNaugh
ton eliminated Heatley of California
and his teammate, Harry Eichelber
ger. In addition he won the qualify
ing medal with his 36-hole total of
]51 strokes.
Schultz, after qualifying fifth,
beat Stuart Hawley of Stanford and
Lawson of U.S.C. on his way to the
finals.
As a result of his victory, Mac-
Naughton becomes the man to meet
the Northern section individual
champion next month for the Pacific
Coast title. The Stanford team will
also meet the championship North
ern group. The matches are sched
uled for the middle of May in
Seattle.
