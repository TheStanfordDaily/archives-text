# FROSH TRACK TEAM TO CLIMAX SEASON FRIDAY AGAINST U.C.
## 
### 
With an in-and-out record for
their preliminary season behind
them, Stanford's freshman track
team faces the climax meet of their
schedule, that with the California
frosh at Berkeley next Friday.
Considering the handicaps of con
ditions and sickness they labored
under, the Babes made a fine
showing in holding the powerful San
Jose State squad to a 79-52 score
last Saturday. Nevertheless for the
second consecutive week they will
be entering a meet as under-dogs.
California has a well balanced,
star studded squad of track athletes,
which has been bringing smiles to
Varsity Coach Walter Christie's face.
Heading the cast are Kicsel and
Kilfoil, star sprint duo, who have
shaded ten seconds flat in the cen
tury on two occasions this year.
Both were high school sensations.
Jimmy Willson, the Indians' best
bet, who also enjoyed considerable
fame in high school as a winged
foot, will have a difficult task to
get more than two third places.
His game leg will not help any,
either.
Besides the two sprints, the Bear
Cub representatives have bettered
Stanford's best performances in the
quarter mile, broad jump, high
jump; they are practically on a com
parison par in the half mile, mile,
discus, shot.
Packard of the Indians will enter
the meet as favorite in the hurdle
races.
