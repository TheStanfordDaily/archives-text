# PLYMIRE EXPECTED TO REGAIN POSITION IN TENNIS RANKINGS
## 
### 
Varsity and freshman tennis lad
der matches resume this week for
the spring quarter. Present rankings
are in a stable condition except for
the varsity third position. It is high
ly probable that Harry Plymire,
former number three, will restore
the old order of affairs when he
meets Joe Coughlin, although
Coughlin has shown plenty of
strength so far this season.
A vacancy on the seventh rung
of the freshman ladder was created
when George Torrence dropped out
for the quarter. Joe Melczer auto
matically fills his place, with Phil
Kneisley right at his heels.
Doubles matches may furnish
some excitement and upsets, being
far less stable than the singles stand
ings.
