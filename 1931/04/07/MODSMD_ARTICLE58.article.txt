# Indian Oval Season Prospects Brighten
## Return of West, Howell After Injuries Augurs Well for Coming Track Meets This Year 
### FRITZ GOODWIN 
JJESPITi: the blot smeared on the 1931 Indian track record last Saturday
by the Mercury athletes of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the sun
shone a little brighter than usual in the Stadium yesterday when Coach
Dink Templeton s runners resumed practice. These added sun-rays were
embodied in the persons of Arnie West, broad-jumper, and Jim Howell,
220 and relay man, who reappeared in track suits after absences caused by
strained muscles. West didn't do :m\ jumping' yesterday, just jogging
and pacing around the track, but his return breathes new hope into the
Cardinal attack. Although it is stilt a question whether he will be in con-

t'dition. 1o compote against California
I on April 18 or the Trojans on May
2, Farm track fans will now have
the possibility of his entry in these
meets with which- to conjecture.
West Is Jump Winner
West is the only jumper on the
squad capable of 24 feet and better,
having won the 1.C.4-A. event last
season with a leap of 24 feet 7- : «
inches, a mark which assures Tem
pleton a first place in any mtet,
with his star in condition.
Howell, aiso a point-winner for
Stanford in the sprints at the na
tional intercollegiates last year, is
needed more this season in the re
lay. He was a member of the famous
four of la: i. season who hung up the
intercollegiate mile relay record of
3 minutes 15 seconds.
Relay Outlook Bright
Against the L.A.A.C. Dink's relay
1 team, minus the services of Howell,
won in the respectable time of 3
minutes 17.8 seconds. With him back
in the line-up, Stanford bids fair to
i set a new mile relay mark this
, spring, for Maynor Shove and Ike
Hables are at least as good as last
year, while Ben Eastman is a faster
i 440 man than John Morrison, who
formerly ran in the anchor position.
Hoc Dyer, whose absence from the
220 starting line at Los Angeles
caused Farm track enthusiasts some
concern, was out for practice yes
' lerday afternoon and apparently as
| fil as ever. He was kept out of the
! furlong last Saturday by a tempor
| ary cramp in his leg, and was not
I suffering from a severe muscle
strain, as rumored.

West Is Jump Winner
West is the only jumper on the
squad capable of 24 feet and better,
having won the 1.C.4-A. event last
season with a leap of 24 feet 7- : «
inches, a mark which assures Tem
pleton a first place in any mtet,
with his star in condition.
Howell, aiso a point-winner for
Stanford in the sprints at the na
tional intercollegiates last year, is
needed more this season in the re
lay. He was a member of the famous
four of la: i. season who hung up the
intercollegiate mile relay record of
3 minutes 15 seconds.
Relay Outlook Bright
Against the L.A.A.C. Dink's relay
1 team, minus the services of Howell,
won in the respectable time of 3
minutes 17.8 seconds. With him back
in the line-up, Stanford bids fair to
i set a new mile relay mark this
, spring, for Maynor Shove and Ike
Hables are at least as good as last
year, while Ben Eastman is a faster
i 440 man than John Morrison, who
formerly ran in the anchor position.
Hoc Dyer, whose absence from the
220 starting line at Los Angeles
caused Farm track enthusiasts some
concern, was out for practice yes
' lerday afternoon and apparently as

strain, as rumored.
JJESPITi: the blot smeared on the 1931 Indian track record last Saturday
by the Mercury athletes of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the sun
shone a little brighter than usual in the Stadium yesterday when Coach
Dink Templeton s runners resumed practice. These added sun-rays were
embodied in the persons of Arnie West, broad-jumper, and Jim Howell,
220 and relay man, who reappeared in track suits after absences caused by
strained muscles. West didn't do :m\ jumping' yesterday, just jogging
and pacing around the track, but his return breathes new hope into the
Cardinal attack. Although it is stilt a question whether he will be in con-

t'dition. 1o compote against California
