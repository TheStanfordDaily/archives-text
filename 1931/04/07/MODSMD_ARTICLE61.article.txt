## 
### 
A spirited non-decision debate,
punctuated by sarcasm on both
sides, took place last night in the
Little Theatre between the fresh
man teams of Stanford and Cali
fornia, on the subject, "Resolved,
that the results of the London Naval
Conference tend toward world
peace."
Stanford, supporting the affirma
tive, was represented by Albert
Cook, Ronald Kay, and Rolland
Woodbury, while Donald Breyer,
Wakefield Taylor, and Fred Good
win upheld the negative for the
Berkeley institution.
The same three Stanford men
took the negative of the subject last
week against a California team, be
ing coached in both engagements by
Stanford Goldner.
The affirmative side contended
that the London Naval Conference
has not by itself prevented war, but
that it is a link in the chain of events
lending toward peace, and that the
conference eliminated naval compe
tition, one of the fundamental causes
of war.
The negative argued that there
have always been conferences, and
there always have been wars, and
that the conferences have not elim
inated the ill-feeling which is the
fundamental cause of war.
