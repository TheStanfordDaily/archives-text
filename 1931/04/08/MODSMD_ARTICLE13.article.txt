# Shepherd Billy Recalls Early Days, First Coeds
## 
### 
Today's 500 lacks the friendly!
charm of a generation ago, accord- !
ing to a spectator who for 30 years \
has watched the undergraduate pass j
over Stanford's campus. Stanford j
1 women today are distant to the !
point of arrogance, but underneath '
| the modern veneer, are as ingcrjuous I
as ever.
So believes William McCullought, |
better known as "Billy the Shep- '
herd," who carried milk to the doors j
of three Stanford presidents during ;
the years before he became herder i
i of the Stanford sheep in 1919.
.While supervising the well-known [
! lawn mower in its collective activi- j
ties near the Polo Field, Billy, a '
I venerable and ruddy-faced Scotch |
lowlander, yesterday offered a |
! glimpse of early days on the Farm. I
Billy has vivid memories of Mrs.
Stanford in the pre-campus era. "I
used to deliver milk to the house,
first stopping to hobnob with the i
coachman. Mrs. Stanford always
asked me if the horses looked well
groomed. She had a personal maid j
I of whom 1 was very fond," admitted^

J Billy.
Billy's earthquake story differs
| from the average report. On that
j momentous occasion he happened to
i be delivering milk in his creaking
wagon. The tremor scared his
; horses, who dragged the wagon into
: a neighboring ditch, adding a local
! milk famine to the exigencies of
| the day.
Museum exhibits to the contrary,
i the aged shepherd declares that the
! present-day dress "of the Stanford
S women is more complex than of
yore. "They used to wear simple
| dresses, not all these frills," ho in
j sists. The rough has not changed
! materially with the passing years, in
| Billy's estimation.
As for the business of sheep-herd
| ing, Billy finds it a pleasant out
door vocation, conducive to a philo
sophic point of view. Two of his
dogs have been killed by automo
i biles in recent years, since the ad
vent of that gas-consuming monster
i to the campus. At present Billy is
I training a police puppy in the tricks
j of the trade.

point of arrogance, but underneath '
| the modern veneer, are as ingcrjuous I
as ever.
So believes William McCullought, |
better known as "Billy the Shep- '
herd," who carried milk to the doors j
of three Stanford presidents during ;
the years before he became herder i
i of the Stanford sheep in 1919.
.While supervising the well-known [
! lawn mower in its collective activi- j
ties near the Polo Field, Billy, a '
I venerable and ruddy-faced Scotch |
lowlander, yesterday offered a |
! glimpse of early days on the Farm. I
Billy has vivid memories of Mrs.
Stanford in the pre-campus era. "I
used to deliver milk to the house,
first stopping to hobnob with the i
coachman. Mrs. Stanford always
asked me if the horses looked well
groomed. She had a personal maid j
I of whom 1 was very fond," admitted^

J Billy.
Billy's earthquake story differs
| from the average report. On that
j momentous occasion he happened to
i be delivering milk in his creaking
wagon. The tremor scared his
; horses, who dragged the wagon into
: a neighboring ditch, adding a local
! milk famine to the exigencies of
| the day.
Museum exhibits to the contrary,
i the aged shepherd declares that the
! present-day dress "of the Stanford
S women is more complex than of
yore. "They used to wear simple
| dresses, not all these frills," ho in
j sists. The rough has not changed
! materially with the passing years, in
| Billy's estimation.
As for the business of sheep-herd
| ing, Billy finds it a pleasant out
door vocation, conducive to a philo
sophic point of view. Two of his
dogs have been killed by automo
i biles in recent years, since the ad
vent of that gas-consuming monster
i to the campus. At present Billy is
I training a police puppy in the tricks
j of the trade.
