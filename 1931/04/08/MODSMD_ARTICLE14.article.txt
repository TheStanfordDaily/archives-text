i DES MOINES, April 7 (/P).—For- j
I mally opening the campaign to send

j 1932, Chairman Shousc of the Na

! this normally Republican state to- j
1 night to attack the administration's ]
i handling of the farm problem and
| the business depression.
Speaking at a dinner under a us-'
pices of the lowa Democratic State 1
j Committee, in the heart of the ag
| ricultural belt and in President
Hoover's native state, Shouse said i
he did not believe the farmers could

Shouse did not mention the pro- I
| hibition issue on which the party's ;
I national chairman, John J. Raskob,
has demanded a stand be taken.
His speech was the first of a series
l in the West and far West.
| "It is only by fighting in the en
! emy country that the war for the
I manumission of the country from 1
t control by the special interests
whose head and front has always
been a Republican administration
j can be won," he said.
"Never have Democratic prospects
been brighter. Never has the party
in power been so demoralized, so
; divided."
G.O.P. Forgot Promises
Shouse said for a time in 1928 the
Democrats thought they might win '
lowa, but the situation was changed
by President Hoover's campaign
promises to aid agricuture.
"But what did President Hoover
I do?" he asked. "He tossed over
board the council of your farm lead
ers and he gave you the farm board.
The result is that today you prod
ucts are worth about half what they
, brought when he undertook to place j
agriculture on a parity with indus
-1 try."
Shouse said the Republican ad
ministration has been "as ineffective
in dealing with the general business
i depression as it has been in dealing I
! with the farm problem."
