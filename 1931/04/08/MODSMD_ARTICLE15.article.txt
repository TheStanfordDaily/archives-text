# HOUSES RELINQUISH ALUMNI DINNERS ON DAY OF BIG MEET
## 
### 
In an attempt to keep the entire
student body and the visiting alum
ni together for the University Day
celebration on April 18, the Inter
fraternity Council has agreed to
forego its customary list of alumni
dinners at the various houses. Stu
dents and alumni are therefore ex
pected to congregate in greater
numbers at the alumni dinner in the
women's gym.
There are several dinners for the
visitors scheduled for Friday night,
April 17, but the fraternities will not
feature the usual open houses on
University Day. The committee in
charge has planned a day that will
occupy all the attention of the re
turning graduates, a program with
which fraternity parties would be
needless interference.
The mid-day barbecue, near the
Faculty Clubhouse, and the dinner
in the gym will serve as the food
supply for the visitors, while the
campus tours in the morning and
the Big Meet and California base
ball game in the afternoon will be
the chief official entertainment.
