# RUSSIAN MOTIF IN OPERA SETS
## Major Characters Will Be Emphasized By Sets 
### 
In designing and building the sets
for the 1931 Junior Opera, Harold
Hclvenston and his technical staff
have introduced a novel idea in the
arrangement of the backgrounds for
this dramatic production.
George Andreini has been spe
cially appointed technical director
for tho opera and Thorington Put
nam is helping Helvenston execute
the sets. The arrangement used is
typical of Russian stagecraft. The
style has been largely employed by
Meierhold and is designed in levels
with the idea of emphasizing major
characters.
New Settings Revised
Helvenston believes the time has
gone when a play may be presented
against draperies. Settings should
reflect the spirit of the play and give
to the scene a variety that does
away with the monotony of back
ground and enhances interest in' the
opera.
Only two main sets are used. The
first act shows the waiting room of
the railway station in Polegrad. Step
units on each side rising to a plat
form in (he back are the feature of
this set. Grimy walls and appropri
ate properties add a realistic effect
to the scene.
Double Stage Built
Act II will show a completely
rigged stage within a stage. There
are to be two scenes with a great
many brilliantly mounted specialty
acts. Individual backgrounds, lights,
and scenery will form a magnificent
stage for these numbers. Lights will
play on (he small inner stage from
different parts of the Assembly Hall
to bring out all details. The office
of the Elder Safely Razor Company
will afford many amusing and sur
prising complications. There will be
no cluttering in any of the sets as
they are designed to give a maxi
mum space to the dancers.
George Andreini with his volun
teer crew of workers has made ex
cellent progress in erecting the sets.
Walter Ncweombe has charge of
properties, Lucy Brown is to ar
range the costuming, and Marshall
Kimball will take care of the off
stage effects.
