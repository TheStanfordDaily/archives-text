Negro Monologue
Presenting a play which has star
tled thousands by its portrayal of
the degeneration of a human mind,
pursued by hallucinations and na
tive fears, written by the popular
Eugene O'Neill, Chesse and his only
assistant, John Carter Ford, have
undertaken a remarkable project.
Chesse reads the lines for Jones, the
principal character, the colored pull
man porter; Ford takes the part of
the only white man in the cast,
Smithers, the trader.
The play is practically a mono
logue and offers many chances for
expert execution. Jones becomes
emperor of a West Indian island,
after serving a term in prison. He
becomes the boss, in power and in
name, a true emperor. He is taunt
ed by spirits returning to goad him
on—his life to the end is horrible.
'Congo' Is Chanted
Shadow puppets are used by
Chesse to impersonate the halluci
nations. Lighting and noise effects
off - stage have been especially
planned to follow fear as it grows
on the mind of the fugitive.
Vachel Lindsay's poem "Congo"
will be chanted as a prologue. Tom
toms will form a rhythmic accom
paniment for the changes in the
discordant mind of the central char
acter, rising and falling with the ac
tion of the play.
