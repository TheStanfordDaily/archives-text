WASHINGTON, April 7. (JP) â€”
The Labor Department is running
special trains across the continent
in its effort to rid the United States
of aliens here illegally.
A campaign against these aliens
has been under way several months.
Since mid-January it has centered
to a large extent in New York City
and Los Angeles.
