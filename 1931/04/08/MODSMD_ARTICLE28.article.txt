# Birdies Bother Par Golfer Eagles Forgotten; Divoteers Shoot Jays Fish, Too, Sought on Green

Golfers on the Stanford course
will carry 30-caliber rifles in their
! golf bags along with the various
| mashies, niblicks, and brassies, and
i will learn to shoot as efficiently as
they drive, if golfing peace is to be
preserved on the green.
I The value of such added equip

followed the MacNaughton-Schultz
{ match for the California intercolle

' Both men had reached the sixth
! green, Schultz with three shots, Mac
i Na ugh ton with four, when the
match was climaxed by the intru

Carefully squinting, mentally
measuring, MacNaughton, Stanford's
defender, lined up his putt and sunk
it. But just as the Berkeley man,
Schultz, lined up and raised his put-
I ter, a fanfare of raucous squawking
I broke from the beak of the blue-jay
I on a neighboring tree.
Slightly disconcerted, Schultz
stepped back, and the bird silenced
himself. The California golfer
, straightened, stepped up again, but
the jay, eyeing the lifted putter, re
i opened his beak in protest. On the
third try, Schultz, forcing disdtin,

putted and missed. This to the glory
of the Cardinal conqueror, and the
enthusiasm of the Farm-bred blue
jay-
This incident is equalled only by
a golfing fish-story, reported dur
ing the first months of the green's
use. It appears that a certain disciple
of the links was playing the third
fairway and his tee shot described a
graceful parabola into the interven
ing section of the creek. This ges
ture, not unlike the experiences of
sundry other golfers, bore this fruit
—a live-pound fish, unconscious
from a blow on the head. Since
poaching is forbidden in San Fran
cisquito Creek, the fisherman beat
down the temptation to secrete his
catch in the folds of his plus-fours,
and instead returned its limp form
to the native waters.

over the course in spring than any
other quarter, according to Floyd
Finch, professional at the Stanford
golf club. San Francisco visitors are
increasing. The rolling five-mile
fairway with its natural hazards and
beauty of horizon is recognized by

of the Cardinal conqueror, and the
enthusiasm of the Farm-bred blue
jay-
This incident is equalled only by
a golfing fish-story, reported dur
ing the first months of the green's
use. It appears that a certain disciple
of the links was playing the third
fairway and his tee shot described a
graceful parabola into the interven
ing section of the creek. This ges
ture, not unlike the experiences of
sundry other golfers, bore this fruit
—a live-pound fish, unconscious
from a blow on the head. Since
poaching is forbidden in San Fran
cisquito Creek, the fisherman beat
down the temptation to secrete his
catch in the folds of his plus-fours,
and instead returned its limp form
to the native waters.
Heavier student traffic moves
over the course in spring than any
other quarter, according to Floyd
Finch, professional at the Stanford
golf club. San Francisco visitors are
increasing. The rolling five-mile
fairway with its natural hazards and
beauty of horizon is recognized by
travelled golfers as one of the best
courses in the United States,
Golfers on the Stanford course
will carry 30-caliber rifles in their

they drive, if golfing peace is to be
preserved on the green.
I The value of such added equip

followed the MacNaughton-Schultz
{ match for the California intercolle

' Both men had reached the sixth
! green, Schultz with three shots, Mac
i Na ugh ton with four, when the
match was climaxed by the intru
| sion of an observant blue-jay.
Carefully squinting, mentally
measuring, MacNaughton, Stanford's
defender, lined up his putt and sunk
it. But just as the Berkeley man,
Schultz, lined up and raised his put-
I ter, a fanfare of raucous squawking
I broke from the beak of the blue-jay
I on a neighboring tree.
Slightly disconcerted, Schultz
stepped back, and the bird silenced
himself. The California golfer
, straightened, stepped up again, but
the jay, eyeing the lifted putter, re
i opened his beak in protest. On the
third try, Schultz, forcing disdtin,

putted and missed. This to the glory
