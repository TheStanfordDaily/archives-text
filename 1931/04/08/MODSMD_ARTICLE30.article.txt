NEW YORK, April 7. (/P)â€”A fed
eral court jury today heard from
opposing counsel two theories in the
mysterious disappearance of $5,000,-
000 in gold which the Bank of
France had on deposit in Petrograd
banks when revolution swept the
country.
The Bank of France, plaintiff in a
I suit against the merged Chase Na
, tional and Equitable Trust Com
; pany, charged through counsel that
1 the gold was "stolen by the soviet
government and that the American
1 banks, acting as the government's
agents, attempted to sell the gold
to the United States Treasury."
The American banks, defendants
in the action, claimed that the gold
they received was the property of
the Soviet and not the Bank of
France, as it alleges.
