Students in universities and colleges in the United j
Slates are treated as infants, not as adults, the editor of a
nationally known weekly magazine eoneludes after view-],
iug the hoop-de-do and erics of "rebellious youth" aroused ; i
by the startling discovery that college men drink.
Recent prohibition raids on fraternity houses and dor- 1 ,
mitories at universities in Oregon, Nebraska, Michigan, and l
Minnesota are evidence of class discrimination, the maga-j
zinc believes, and quotes President Ernest M. Hopkins of
Dartmouth as follows: "They shouldn't raid college fra-'
iernilies unless they are going to raid country clubs audi
other clubs on the outside. The two stand in exactly the
same position, and 1 notice whenever I enter a club that a
man who really wants a drink invariably gets it."
Whatever the merits of prohibition as a theory, not
even the slaunchesl advocates of the measure can call it
a howling success in its present form. Willi speakeasies on
every corner, and sometimes in the middle of the block; j
villi liquor of every kind available on 10 minutes' notice!
to the man who can pay; with senators, lawyers, doctors,!
salesmen, clerks, and ditch-diggers drinking every day, j
why must the long-haired gentry pick on the college man j
as a horrible example?
College students form probably the most law-abiding j
group in America. Crime and corruption are conspicuous!
by their absence in nearly every college community, and it
is on the claim that liquor breeds crime and corruption!
that the prohibitionists base their arguments. Hut college!
students make good "copy" and every time one of them;
is caught with a beer label on his person, there is a great!
outcry by the reformers.
Such a condition would be laughable were it not so
deadly serious. Seeking to cover up their almost nation-J
wide failure by sticking their noses into the colleges, the ;
drys are making a mistake, as the magazine editorial, men-1
tinned above, points out. Six million men and women now!
m college will be voting for the first time at the next elec
tion. How many of them will consider the recent univer-i
sitv raids as argumenis for prohibition?
