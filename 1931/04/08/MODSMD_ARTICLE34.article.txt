# COLLEGE-MADE MARRIAGES
## 
### 
"Modern marriages, at least the most successful ones, i
are made in college!" This is the assertion of a writer in j
the current issue of (iood Ilonsekecpimj. The assertion is j
backed up hy sketchy hut significant figures. In the first |
111.) years of the century, approximately one out of every!
nine marriages in the t ailed Slates ended in divorce. But j
of those who married after having met in college, only one
couple in 7f> was divorced.
In seeking reasons for the greater stability of college-1
made marriages, Ihe writer finds several primary factors. |
Chief among these are:
Less incompatibility, because of equal education, great- 1
< r mental congeniality, and more mutual interests;
Less tendency toward jealousy, minimized among the
informal and democratic contacts of a co-educational;
campus;
Courtships of two and three years while working for
degrees and wailing for salaries;
An opportunity for comparison and selection.
Of these, the last is the most important. The college
years offer a unique opportunity to the individual for in-1
formal association with a h irge group of people of the
same age. By and large, Ihe college group is definitely
superior to the general average. One of Ihe less discussed !
functions of college is this bringing together of consider-j
able groups of superior men and women. That it is an ini-1
porlant function is shown by the relative success of college 1
marriages.
