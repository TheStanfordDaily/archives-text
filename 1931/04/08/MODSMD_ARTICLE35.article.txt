Following are a few cxcerpls from a recent Daihj C.ali
fornian editorial:
"For .'{l years we gloried in the possession of the toma
hawk, and now, Ihe vers lirsl year that we lose it, there
commences a moan . . . there is an absolute need for such
a rally . . . (lie Axe was always rather incidental to the
rally . . . let's keep the flame burning brightly and make
the Ax a living thing at (California, no mailer how deeply
they may have buried il down on Ihe Farm."
Oil, well!

I'.S.C. is annoyed because a stage act fealures one of
their football songs. I'rging action, the Dai I a Trojan said:
"Perhaps if the student body were to hear a radio program
with a theme song advertising shoes or pig-knuckles set to
the strains of 'Fight On!' there would be a hfJwl."
Of course, advertising pig-skins is something else.
