THUNDER ABOVE THE SEA. By ,
Heinvich Haxiser. Horace Liv
eright, New Y«irk. 1931. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
If you are weary of the usual
j detective story or sentimental ro
; mance here is a book that should
I either work wonders with your
j jaded brain or ruin it completely (
I once and for all.
I With typical German obscurity
I and scarcely any plot at all the
; author recounts the psychological
| reactions' of an aviator and a demi
! monde after a very passionate and
j very unlikely interlude. Every other
! chapter is taken up with autobio
| graphical sketches of the author |
, either sojourning among the weird
ly gloomy black Irish or setting up
house in a German seaport.
Patrick Kirwan, who translated
the novel from the German, has ap
i parently done a good job and the |
; beauty of the English is the only
I really enjoyable and undisturbing
; part of the book.
j The whole thing reads like the
1 wildest of Freud's dream books, so
1.... if you are sure that there is j
i no insanity in the family and you |

are healthy and normal at the mo
ment, read it. —S. C. A.
ENDING IN EARNEST. By Re been
West. Doubleday, Doran. New
York, 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
"Ending In Earnest" is a literary
log of collected essays, written from
time to time while traveling in Eu
rope, where Miss West met m u ny
of the foremost contemporary
writers. It might almost be called a
journal, in which are jotted inter
esting bits of information, critical
comments, and personal experiences.
Van Druten, Galsworthy, Elinor
Wylie, Radclyffe Hall, and Virginia
Woolf are a few of the authors cho
sen as subjects. Impressions ol !
"Journey's End" and "Young Wood
ley" are critically discussed, both as
to their individual merits, and as
they represent the present youth of
England.
With her entertaining style, it is
as though Miss West were in her
salon, introducing her readers to
contemporary literary "lions." Those
v/ho have had yearnings to know
their favorite authors will enjoy
"Ending In Earnest." —J. N.
