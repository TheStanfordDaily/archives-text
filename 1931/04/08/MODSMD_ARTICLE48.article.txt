Way hack in the dark winter
months, fans on the Farm
watched with interest the de
\ elopment of Dink Templeton's
1931 track and fit Id team, seeing
ii shape slowly into a potentially
great aggregation, perhaps even
strong enough to stand in line on
a par with Stanford's immortal
three, the 1.C.4-A. championship
squads of '27. '28, and '25). Final
ly, that team sallied forth three
weeks ago to show its wares,
and dopcsters sat hack and
ceased their scribbling to let re
sults tell the story.
The Winged "O" was soundly
whipped, the Huskies suffered a
similar fate two weeks later, and
fans continued to wait for enlighten
ing performances. Then L.A.A.C.
took the measure of Dink's stellar
outfit, but still it remains something
of a dark horse. Now the redshirled
athletes have returned to the prac
tice oval to remain for two whole
weeks, after which they plan to tri
umph over the Bears without show
ing their best. It looks as though the
result-starved enthusiasts will have
to continue scribbling and doping in
the dark, hardly knowing what to
expect against the Trojans until late
in the afternoon of May 2.
While a lull has overtaken
track activity at Stanford U.,
baseball is at its height. That
overdue day that veteran peanut
crackers had long awaited finally
arrived Saturday at Berkeley—
Norm Horner was beaten. At
last Wolter had a pitcher to
check the Bear sluggers, and the
rest of the team backed him up
in the field as well as at bat.
Dan Johnson has proved the
answer to the prayer of the fans.
But the Indians need more than
one star moundsman. That was
demonstrated too clearly in the
Trojan game Friday, and empha
sized rfgain in the sloppy contest
staged with the weak S.F.U.
nine.
But a remedy looms for this situa
tion, coming from the direction of
Cuddeback's otherwise mediocre
freshman ball club. Stan Anderson
is the fair-haired boy to whom we
refer, a young man who lists among
his credentials a record of 12 strike
outs in the first Bear Cub-Papoose
encounter. What a sweet pair he
and Johnson will make in 1932!
But Dan will have to carry the
burden for the two remaining
Big Series tilts. Two more llor
ner-Johnson pitching duels, both
scheduled for the new Stanford
ball park on the next two Satur
days. are viewed as fhe treat of
the ages for the peanut-munch
ing multitude. Disregarding the
pair that remains to be played
with S.F.U.. the Indians must
take both of these tussles to
cinch the conference. A split
would knot the title between
Wolter's nine and U.C., and the
Trojans if they win all their re
maining lilts.

Baseball will have to share the
limelight with swimming next week
end, since the cream of college
talent in this state wiil meet in Er.-
cina pool both Friday and Saturday.
Coast middle distance records will
rest on a very unsteady foundation
when Buster Crabbe, Trojan star,
fights it out with Austin Clapp, In
dian ace, in their second encounter
this year. Back East a couple of
weeks ago these two divided the
440- and 220-yard freestyle inter
collegiate titles, with Clapp annex
ing the crown in the shorter race.
Mickey Riley, who won the diving
competition in the same meet, will
also appear to bolster the cause of
U.S.C.
Some kind of a record ought
to he put down in the books for
the Indian tennis team, com
posed of such stars as Keith
Glcdhill. Ted Easton, Joe Cough
lin. and Harry Plymire. After
taking the measure of both
Troy and the Bruins in Los An
geles during the recent vaca
tion. this aggregation of satel
lites made a clean sweep here
last week-end over the same
two teams, dropping only one
meet, that to U.S.C., in the two
days of play. Against the Bruins,
no one set of any match was
more than 6-3, while Neieder
auer took his man in straight
sets, (i-0. (i-0.
—Crawford.
