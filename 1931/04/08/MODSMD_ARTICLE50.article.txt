## MEET CONSIDERED TO SSUP: SPRINTS CALIFORNIA FORTE Hurdles, Javelin, Weights Sources Of Strength For Card Squad 
### Michael Crofoot 
Judging from the best season per
: formances of the California fresh
: man track team, the result of their
I clash with the Indian babes at Ber
! keley Friday is a toss-up.
Particularly strong in the sprints
I and jumps, the Bear Cubs are com
j paratively v/eak in the hurdles and
| javelin. Their slight edge in the dis
\ tance runs is offset by the Stanford
j advantage in the v/eight events.
Cal Dash Men Strong
Kiesel, Kilfoil, and Van Lobensels,
| the California dash men, compose
j probably the greatest freshman
| sprint trio ever assembled on the
' coast.
Kiesel first' gained fame when he
ran a 9.7 hundred for Tamalpais
High. Victorious in every start this
, season, he has been clocked twice
! in 10 flat and once in 9.9.
Kilfoil won his last 200-yard dash
| in 19.8 seconds, and has yet to be
; bested in this event this season.
Forced from the limelight by his
fleet mates, Van Lobensels has been
finishing a bang-up third in these
! two races.
i To oppose this trio Stanford has
| only Jimmy Wilson, whose best time
| for the century this year is 10.1.
Crissy, Lyman to Duel
Crissy of California will give the
j Indians' Lyman a duel in the weight
events. He has hurled the discus out
135 feet and tossed the 12-pound
shot over 50 feet.
Lyman has not been throwing the
12-pounder this year, but in high
j school he got it out to the 56-foot
mark. If he can duplicate his 48-foot
heave of the 16-pound ball, his op
| poncnt will have to be content with
! second place.
