# SIGMA CHI DIAMOND TEAM DOWNS A.T.O., 19-4, IN FIRST GAME
## 
### 
Defeating the A.T.O.'s 19 to 4, the
Sigma Chi intramural baseball team
started its season auspiciously yes
terday afternoon on the new intra
mural ball diamond.
As the score shows, the game was
1 one-sided from start to finish.
Waterman chucked the whole game
for the winners and was never in
difficulty. Both squads played
loosely in the field, except for one
double play executed by Larsen and
1 Chote of the winners.
Thigpen, who chucked for the
losers, was no puzzle, and was hard
hit in all but one inning.
In the other scheduled game Sigma
Nu failed to show up and defaulted
to the Delta Chi's. Parker Reed, in
| tramural manager, urges that all
! teams show up on time, so that a
i full seven-inning game can be
played. Yesterday's fracas went only
I six innings, because the squads were
late in starting.
Today's games bring together the
! Alpha Sigs and Kappa Alpha on the
: Sequoia field, and the Japanese Club
â–  and the A.K.L.'s on the intramural
. diamond./
