# CALIFORNIA SERIES VICTORY IN SIGHT FOR BALL NINE; WORK REOPENS TODAY
## 
### Francis Lloyd 
With the prospect of assuring
themselves of the first California
series victory in six years if they
defeat the Bears next Saturday, the
Stanford baseball nine will today
enter three days of intensive prac
tice, after laying off yesterday for a
'well-earned holiday.
[ Even though the Cards came out
of the first Bear tilt on the long end
of the score, they have no right to
suppose that California will not be
1 dangerous in their second encoun
-5 ter on April 11. .As Dan Johnscn
i ably expi'essed it after the game last
; Saturday, "Every ball had to be

good before a Bear would take a
cut at it.''
This may account for the four
! free passes which Johnson allowed.
The Bears could not be tempted by
doubtful balls. Even though defeat
! ed. Norm Horner gave every indi-

cation of being the same sterling
performer who had handed the Eed
shirts six straight defeats.
Looking back to the beginning of
the season and comparing the team
then with the team as it is today,
there are two players who stand
out as having made unbelievable
improvements, Dykes Johnson and
Gordy Campbell.
Moving Johnson from short to
third base turned out to be a master
stroke on the part of Coach Harry
Wolter. Where last year Johnson
was inclined to hurry his pegs and
make poor throws, this year he has
been consistently accurate. John
son's effectiveness at bat has also

improved.
Although fairly good at gathering
in ity balls last year, Gordy Camp
bell's throwing arm was something
which intimidated practically no
body. This season, however, Camp
bell has been making base runners'
Jives miserable with his accurate
throws, which have been responsible
for several saving outs in crucial
games.
