### 
Stanford's freshman ball tossers
defeated the Menlo Junior College
nine yesterday afternoon on the
practice lield, a ninth inning rally
netting two runs to give the year
lings an 8 to 7 victory.
Bob Savinske undertook the hurl
ing for the Indian babes and turned
in a creditable performance, whif
fing six opponents and allowing
eight hits. He had one bad inning,
the third, in which Ihe Menlo slug
gers made four hi Is count for live
runs.
Cuddeback's men collected two
runs in ihe third, one in the fourth,
and added three in the eighth
frame, Savinske steaming into the
last inning with the score tied at
six up. Stringer slashed out a long
hit in the first half of the inning
that bounded over the fence for a
cheap home run, to put Menlo in the
lead.
The Indians made their half of
the ninth short and sweet. Maentz,
first man up, connected for a triple
into right field, and Miles, who fol
lowed him, duplicated the feat to
bring in Maentz and place himself
on third. Bacon then won the game
with a single that scored Miles.
Maentz, usually reliable shortstop,
had a bad day in the field, being re
sponsible for five of the six errors
credited to Stanford.
Summary
Menlo: 7 runs, 8 hits, 2 errors;
Stanford: 8 runs, 9 hits, 6 errors.
