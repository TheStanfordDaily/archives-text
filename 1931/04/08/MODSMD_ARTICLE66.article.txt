# RASKOB PROHIBITION POLL CREATES STIR AMONG DEMOCRATS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April. 7. (/PI â€”
Protest, praise, and discord today
followed Chairman Raskob's prohi
bition poll of Democratic National
Committeemen.

What would happen was problem
atical. A number of Southern dry
leaders, however, redoubled efforts
to forestall convention appx - oval of
Ihe National Committee Chairman's
home rule plan. Others saw his
proposition as a solution to prohibi
tion questions, while at least one
committeeman urged the pai'ty to
commit itself to a referendum on
the eighteenth amendment.

Senator Hull of Tennessee, who
once held the position Raskob now
occupies, interpreted the poll as an
effort to make prohibition a "para
mount issue, which automatically
would, for an indefinite number of
years, exclude serious or deliberate
consideration of all other issues and
problems," no matter how vexing.
