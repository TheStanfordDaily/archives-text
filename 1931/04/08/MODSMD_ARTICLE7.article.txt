# CHOIR PRESENTS HOLY NUMBERS
## Allen Directs Post-Lenten Concert Selections 
### 
] Last evening in the Memorial
Chapel the University Choir, di
rected by Warren D. Allen, sup
plemented by the Marguerite Mac-
Manus String Ensemble, presented
a program of after-Easter music.
The numbers given were:
"Christ Lay in Death's Dark Prison"
i Brandenburg Concerto, No. 5, in G
Major"
Cantata, No. 67, "Hold in Affection
Jesus Christ" Bach
The second number is considered
one of the best concerti in chamber
music literature. The Cantata was
j written for the Sunday after Easter.
It portrays the apeparance of Christ
to the disciples after the resurrec
( tion and suggests the reassuring
j words of Christ to his followers.
The MacÃŸJanus String Ensemble
j from Palo Alto gave an admirably
I symphonized performance. Mrs.
MacManus has previously conducted
j a similar ensemble of students at
Oregon State College. She is well
known for her work in directing
students.
Soloists of the evening were Es
ther H. Allen, contralto; Henry She
foff, bass; Carl Hooper, tenor, from
San Francisco; and Ruth L. Savage,
! organist.
