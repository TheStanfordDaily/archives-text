LISBON, Portugal, April 7. (/P) â€”
Determined to avoid bloodshed if
possible in putting down a military
revolt at Funchal, Madeira, the gov
ernment nevertheless today con
tinued its preparations to recover
the island capital by force if that
should prove necessary.
The transport Pedro Gomez with
600 troops sailed this morning after
having been delayed several hours
by mechanical difficulties. Tomor
row the transport Jubango will leave
with four seaplanes and a regiment
of artillery, and on Thursday the
transport Lima will sail for Funchal.
It was understood that the air
planes would fly over Funchal be
fore the troops landed and that an
effort would be made to persuade
the rebels to surrender.
Today the government issued an
official denial of reports that the
revolt had extended to the Azoi'es,
but strict censorship was still im
posed on messages to and from
Funchal.
