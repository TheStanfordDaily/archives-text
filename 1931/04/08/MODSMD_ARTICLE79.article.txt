HENRYETTA. Okla., April 7. W>)
â€”Judge J. Harry Swan said today
Okmulgee county had no funds with
which to pay a jury to try George
Darnell, confessed slayer of thir
teen persons in a train wreck here,
and that he would pass sentence
himself tomorrow afternoon.
The judge declined to say what
the sentence would be. Oklahoma
law permits the assessment of the
death penalty on a plea of guilty.
