# HORSE, BEAN BAGS AMONG EQUIPMENT PLANNED FOR GYM
## Practice Golf Course May Be Added If Funds Prove Sufficient 
### Ann Adams 
Everything from a vaulting horse
to twelve bean bags are on the list
of equipment to be purchased with
the $20,000 which is being raised for
the new women's gymnasium by the
vigorous campaign of the Stanford
"500," assisted by the auxiliary.
In addition to the equipment for
the gymnasium and the new swim
ming pool, plans have ben made to
resurface the six tennis courts in
back of the gymnasium.
Lockers Needed
Additional new lockers must be
installed, and some of the funds will
be used for the upkeep of all sports
and the maintenance of the grounds
and athletic fields. Hockey is the
most expensive sport, due to its
large fields.
There is even a faint hope that if
more money is secured than is
necessary for the more important
equipment, a four-hole golf course
for instruction purposes will be in
stalled.
Furnishings are to be purchased
for all offices in the building, in
cluding those for both the medical
adviser's and gymnasium director's
divisions. A lounge, a kitchen, and
waiting rooms will also be furnished.
Cold Treatment Planned
A nose and throat pressure ap
paratus for the treatment of colds,
chief malady of Stanford women,
and a new ultra-violet lamp will be
included in the proposed medical
equipment. Posture correction will
some day be greatly aided by a
camera for posture work.
Curtains must be purchased for
the whole building, including a back
curtain for the dance studio. Final
ly, after all these plans have been
carried out, a grand piano will be
added to the dance studio, which
will also be used when various cam
pus dances are held in the new
gymnasium.
