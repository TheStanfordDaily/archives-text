# O'NEILL DRAMA SCORES HIT AS PUPPET SHOW
## Chesse's Marionettes Play "Emperor Jones" In Gym Benefit CHARACTERS ARE GOOD Scenery, Lighting Effects Used To Advantage 
### Virginia Tanzey 
Appreciatively followed from the
irst lines of the first act to the last
}it of the last scene, Ralph Chesse's
narionettes appeared before a Stan
ord audience last night in O'Neill's
Jrama, "Emperor Jones." The pro
luction was given as a benefit for
he furnishing fund of the new
Women's Gymnasium, under the
.upervision of the women's gym
.•ommittee.
The wooden actors were beauti
ully formed, and managed with ex
ceptional skill. Smithers, the white
rader, read by John Carter Ford,
vas a pith-helmeted, English
peaking, mirthless individual with
i way about him. The old woman,
darkey-lady with a throaty, rhyth
nic voice, was charmingly portrayed
>y Leslie Chesse.
Jones Well Received
Emperor Jones himself was almost
eal—a swash-buckling negro ruler,
ure of himself, sure of his ability
o cope with any situation. Chesse,
vho read the lines for the principal
haracter, showed much feeling for
he colored porter, both in showing
lis feelings through the words
poken, and his actions.
The shadow puppets were start
ingly realistic, appearing suddenly
ipon the stage, and as suddenly dis
ppearing at the reports from Jones's
un. The dice-throwers, the convict
iborers, and the galley slaves were
ilainly seen, and yet, because of the
ighting effects, misty as hallucina
ions should be.
Tom-Tom Boats
The prologue, which consisted of
he chanting of Vachel Lindsay's
The Congo," was stirring. The reg
lar beat of the tom-tom fonned a
teady accompaniment for the
hythm of the poem, and for the
hanges in the discordant mind of
!mperor Jones.
Working with miniature people,
'hesse has done a great job of
howing performances in which
larionettes take really sophisticated
arts. The monologue of "Emperor
ones" was easily adopted to the
uppet-stage. The entire play was
elicately handled. There was a defi
itc finish about the production that
espoke of real talent.
