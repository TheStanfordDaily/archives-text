# CERMAK IS TO 'CLEAN' CHICAGO
## Mayor-Elect Promises To Reorganize City 
### 
CHICAGO, Apr. 8 (/P).â€”A speedy
reorganization of the Chicago mun
nicipal government was promised
tonight by Mayor-elect Anton J.
Cermak, who expected to be induct
ed to office Friday.
The man who beat William Hale
Thompson by 191,916 votes in Tues
day's election spent most of the day
selecting men for the more impor
tant jobs out of the 12,000 appoin
tive positions he must fill. He gave
but little of his time to the reading
of congratulatory messages.
"I promised to clean out the City
Hall," he said, "and I'm going to
lose no time doing it. The bums
and hoodlums who hang around in
the corridors and make the City Hall
look like like a cheap lodging house
on Saturday night are going to be
swept right out."
The new mayor will have a work
ing majority in the City Council,
considerably enhanced by victories
which accompanied his own success
Tuesday. Thirty of the city's fifty
aldermen are Democrats.
More than 3000 congratulatory
messages poured into Cermak's of
fice, several from his native Czecho
slovakia.
The mayor elect finally succumbed
to insistent long distance telephone
calls from London newspapers.
"What are you going to do about
A1 Capone?" was one question near
ly all of the English reporters asked.
"1 understand he is out of town,"
replied Cermak, "and my advice to
him is to stay out for the next four
years. He is under sentence here,
you know, and I suggest that he stay
in Florida."
