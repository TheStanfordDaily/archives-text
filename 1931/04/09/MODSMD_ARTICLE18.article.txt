# Emperor Jones' Voice Is Beret Clad Back Stage
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Emperor Jones, king of the bush
negroes, fell back, slumped into the
muck of the swamp, dying. The
husky voice, rich with negroid ca
dence, gasped on, muttering the last
slang-philosophy of the wharf negro,
Pullman porter. The lights on the
stage flicked off, and the voice of
Emperor Jones resolved itself into
a pair of jaunty gray trousers,
sweater, and beret, which descended
the ladder backstage.
Ralph Chesse, artist—young, deli
cately built, versatile—designer,
sculptor, actor, poet. When the em
peror was hung up on his hook,
Chesse cordially answered questions.
"Producing tragedy on a marion
ette stage is a somewhat radical
venture," he said. "America is not,
like Europe, steeped in the artistic
tradition of the puppeteer." Marion
ettes, he explains, are lik» sketches
that illustrate a book -imaginative,

i impressionistic, more suggestive than
! the fiesh-and-blood actors.
An ambitious start with the pro
: duction of Hamlet, more than three
i years ago, has been followed by
| Emperor Jones. Macbeth, the sophis
i ticated comedy of Don Juan, Hansel
and Gretel, and Romeo and Juliet.
Unlike Tony Surg, whom he says
! has won popularity through theatri
| cal trickery and illusion rather than
quality of drama, Chesse strives to
ward art for art's sake, appealing to
the sophisticated audience rather
' than to delight children.
Always clutched by the desire to
I act, Chesse was never fully satisfied
I until he could play all the parts at
once, as he so effectively from
the bridge of his tiny stage. In Ham
j let he takes six roles. In Emperor
Jones he animates an old negro \vo
-1 man besides his astonishingly adept
portrayal of the emperor.
