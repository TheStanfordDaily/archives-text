# BUTLER ADDRESSES LAW STUDENTS ON LIFE AS BARRISTER
## 
### 
Life as a member of the Bar, with
all its pitfalls and ladders, its tri
umphs and disappointments — this
was the central theme of an address
by Vincent "Butler, member of the
San Francisco Bar, at a Law Asso
ciation smoker last night in the Old
Union.
"The greatest obstacles are in the
early years," Butler said. "I believe
that it is a mistake for young law
yers or law students to plan on spe
cializing during their early years. A
general practice is invaluable for a
time, at least. Specialization will
take care of itself.
"The finest quality in a lawyer or
law student is industry—the ability
to plod in spite of obstacles. Dic
tion is also important. Moot trials,
such as those held at Stanford, arc
valuable training in this respect and
in the teaching of research meth
ods."
