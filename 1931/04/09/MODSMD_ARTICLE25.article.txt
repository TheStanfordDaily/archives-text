# LECTURER CREATES MINIATURE QUAKES
## 
### 
Earthquakes to order were cre
ated in a demonstration and lecturc
by Lydik S. Jacobsen, assistant pro
fessor in mechanical engineering, in
the Hydraulics and Materials labo
ratories last night.
The quakes were not real, but
were produced on a movable plat
form, on which several types ol
shocks can be duplicated. Large
single shocks may be made by re
leasing a heavy pendulum from i
large platform held in place by huge
springs. Prolonged shocks, such a:
the motion of the Japanese earth
quake, can be produced by a revolv
ing disc that sets a small platforrr
in irregular motion. The model usee
is the miniature framework of ;
modern office building.
