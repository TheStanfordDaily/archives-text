# WILBUR OVER RADIO SAYS ILLITERACY IS DECREASING IN U.S.

### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary
of the Interior while absent on leave
from his position as president of
Stanford, spoke last night over the
Columbia Broadcasting System in
his capacity as chairman of the na
tional advisory committee on illit
eracy.
It is Dr. Wilbur's opinion that il
literacy in the United States is de
creasing. "The advances among the
Indians," said the Secretary of the
Interior, "have given us hope that
illiteracy may eventually be virtu
ally eliminated from among all the
elements in our population."
Dr. Wilbur's talk was the last of
a series of radio talks on this subject
given by nationally known authori
ties.
Groups in forty-three states and
the District of Columbia have been
organized by Secretary Wilbur in
his campaign conducted to blot out
ignorance in letters. Twenty-three
national organizations have joined
the movement for better educational
standards.
