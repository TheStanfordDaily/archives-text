# OREGON'S EDUCATIONAL REFORMATION
## 
### 
I nusual and interesting are the recommendations for
the reorganization of I lit* svslem of higher education in,
Oregon submitted last week hv the federal survey ap
pointed to investigate that problem. In brief, the plan eon-1
templates the development of a school of science tit Oregon
State College located tit Corvallis and of a N college of arts |
at the state university located at Eugene.
The report contains six recommendations, as follows:
1. The training of teachers for the elementary schools'
at the three normal schools in Oregon.
2. Unspecialized freshman and sophomore work to be
available at both the I Diversity of Oregon and tit Oregon
State College.
'A. A great school of science to be developed at Corvallis.
4. A great school of arts, literature, and social sciences
to be developed at Eugene.
f>. The professional schools based essentially upon the
natural sciences to be located at Corvallis.
6. The professional schools resting essentially upon the j
arts, literatures, and the social sciences to be located at
Eugene or at Portland.
The purpose of the investigation, instituted by the 1 egis-,
lature, was to plan a system which would do away with
the petty bickerings and institutional encroachments of!
the University of Oregon and Oregon State College. Ob
viously, the survey aimed at taking some of the politics out
of state supported education, at eliminating the evils that*
inevitably accompany the annual scramble for state ap
propriations by two similar institutions deriving their sup-!
port from the same source. The recommendations would
do away with the educational rivalry between the two
schools by eliminating the parallelism now existing.
At the same time the survey has in mind a saving of
money for the people of Oregon by ti more ellicient ex
penditure of the funds now available for education. There!
will lie no duplication of the advanced departments of the i
university and tin 4 stale college; the one will teach science
and engineering, the other liberal arts, social sciences, and j
the professions based on them.
It is an interesting plan, but, if adopted, will it work?
Will it accomplish its dual purpose, the elimination of fric
tion and the saving of money? The Daily doubts that it
will. The new plan may work for a while, bill in time it is |
likely that Eugene wiil exert every effort to make its col
lege of art' greater than the college of engineering and
science at Corvallis, and the latter in its turn will do the
same. And then, once again there will be the old, old ,
scramble for state monevs.

State College located tit Corvallis and of a N college of arts |
at the state university located at Eugene.
The report contains six recommendations, as follows:
1. The training of teachers for the elementary schools'
at the three normal schools in Oregon.
2. Unspecialized freshman and sophomore work to be
available at both the I Diversity of Oregon and tit Oregon
State College.
'A. A great school of science to be developed at Corvallis.
4. A great school of arts, literature, and social sciences
to be developed at Eugene.
f>. The professional schools based essentially upon the
natural sciences to be located at Corvallis.
6. The professional schools resting essentially upon the j
arts, literatures, and the social sciences to be located at
Eugene or at Portland.
The purpose of the investigation, instituted by the 1 egis-,
lature, was to plan a system which would do away with
the petty bickerings and institutional encroachments of!
the University of Oregon and Oregon State College. Ob
viously, the survey aimed at taking some of the politics out
of state supported education, at eliminating the evils that*
inevitably accompany the annual scramble for state ap
propriations by two similar institutions deriving their sup-!
port from the same source. The recommendations would
do away with the educational rivalry between the two
schools by eliminating the parallelism now existing.
At the same time the survey has in mind a saving of
money for the people of Oregon by ti more ellicient ex
penditure of the funds now available for education. There!
will lie no duplication of the advanced departments of the i
university and tin 4 stale college; the one will teach science
and engineering, the other liberal arts, social sciences, and j
the professions based on them.
It is an interesting plan, but, if adopted, will it work?
Will it accomplish its dual purpose, the elimination of fric
tion and the saving of money? The Daily doubts that it
will. The new plan may work for a while, bill in time it is |
likely that Eugene wiil exert every effort to make its col
lege of art' greater than the college of engineering and
science at Corvallis, and the latter in its turn will do the
same. And then, once again there will be the old, old ,
scramble for state monevs.
I nusual and interesting are the recommendations for
the reorganization of I lit* svslem of higher education in,
Oregon submitted last week hv the federal survey ap
pointed to investigate that problem. In brief, the plan eon-1
templates the development of a school of science tit Oregon
State College located tit Corvallis and of a N college of arts |
at the state university located at Eugene.
