tropolis, live members of Phi Reta Kappa were discovered

A rather prevalent assertion maintains lliat a good rec
ord in college will have little lo do with success in after
life. Here is an example which seemingly corroborates this
belief. The "A's" in trigonometry, the "100's" in final ex
ams. the lengthy theses have availed these New York Phi
Retes nothing in a material way. Perhaps lliey would be
glad to exchange their college courses for a good steady
job with a *2.~> pay envelope coming every week. Right now
they value solid food more than the valedictory certificates.
Rut these live wearers of the golden key are not typical
of their brothers in the oldest fraternity in existence. A
recent survey discloses that out of 28,000 individuals listed
in "Who's Who," over ">OOO are members of Phi Reta
Kappa. Moreover, of the persons belonging lo this hono
rary scholarship graduated in the last lf> years, 20 per cent
have attained the honor of (hiding (heir names among
those in "Who's Who." Surely this would definitely indi
cate thai there is a decided correlation between university
( areers and those pursued after college days are over. If
one out of every live Phi Reta Kappas can be reasonably
Mire of real advancement in the outside world, the other
members should not fall very far short of this recognition.
So we might conclude that Phi Reta Kappa is more
than an honorary society of those students who foolishly
waste their time studying in college instead of enjoying
themselves. It is an organization whose members will be
repaid for their efforts in school by success in later life.
