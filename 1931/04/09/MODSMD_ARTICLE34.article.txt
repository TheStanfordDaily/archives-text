# BULL SESSION

### 
Another man, today, realizes that
it does not pay to cross a woman—
especially when that woman belongs
to your party. The man in question
is William ("Big Bill") Thompson.
There are many reasons why Hiz
zoner Thompson was defeated. Fore
most, however, was his desertion of
the Republican candidate for the
Senate last year, Mrs. Ruth Hanna
McCormick. To desert one's party
during an election is treason; but to
desert its woman candidate is sui
cide. It is safe to say that many of
the Democratic winner's tallies were
from Republicans who did unto "Big
Bill" what "Big Bill" had done unto
Ruth last winter.
Then also, the present sweep in
Illinois toward the Democratic party
probably played a part in the Re
publican defeat. It is to be recalled
that Senator "Ham" Lewis was
elected by about a 700,000 majority
(if our memory serves us); it is also
significant that the entire Demo
cratic ticket in Chicago was elected.
This might seem to indicate that the
election of Cermak was more than
a spite vote against Thompson.
And the last and most-talked
about cause of Thompson's defeat is
the crime situation in Chicago. It
is difficult to estimate the genuine
extent of criminality in Chicago; if
one were to believe California news
papers, one might be justified in be
lieving that veritable armies of
gangsters were mobilized in the
Southside Jungles and the North
side Badlands-respectively, and then

swept out upon each other—clash
ing in a death throe along Stale
Street. According to the papers, it
would seem that honest citizens pick
their way among the dead that pile
the streets four deep, brandishing
small cannons, sawed-off shotguns,
and other minor weapons.
Since a Chicago "dateline" became
front page news, wc must not forget
that New York has the best judges
money can buy; and other cities not
quite so far away as Chicago have
their crime situations as well. We
know people who have lived in
Chicago for years without seeing or
hearing anything more dangerous
than a popgun.
Be that as it may, it must be con
ceded that racketeering in legitimate
businesses, if not the more sensa
tional phases of the Chicago situa
tion, did play a part in the defeat
of Thompson.
We don't know, but it is very like
ly that Cermak proclaimed, "Elect
me and clean up Chicago." Me and
his ticket are now elected. Many
people will expect Chicago to be
come as peaceful and good as a
Sunday School class. In all proba
bility, little will take place. It was
good policy to defeat Thompson on
the grounds, "Things can't be any
worse; they might be better." But to
think that the millenium will be
ushered into Chicago by the elec
tion of one man —when it takes
years to change the underlying so
cial fabric upon which a system of
crime is built, is ridiculous.
