UNFAITHFUL—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
As another "Chatterton Sensa
tion," this picture is disappointing.
The incomparable Ruth has mo
ments of charm and appeal, but
these are clouded by scenes which
are not her style at all. In particu
lar, there is the sophisticated party
scene, where Miss Chatterton is sup
posed to turn "hard-boiled." The
incongruity of her attempt is fright
fully uncomfortable for those who
admire her talents. One is acutely
embarrassed for the lady herself.
However, lines flash back and
forth brilliantly throughout the pic
ture, and there is an intense quality
in the acting and the tone of the
scenes, which is not melodrama but
something far better—chiefly be
cause of the superlatively fine work
of the supporting cast. Paul Lucas
is notable, and his rival is no less so.

THE PRODIGAL—At the Varsity
Theatre.
Here is a picture for your MUST
list. Presenting Lawrence Tibbett as
the actor, rather than as the singer,
this rollicking comedy of the South
i is thoroughly entertaining. Not that
Tibbett doesn't use that golden voice
of his—he sings a new song by Vin
j cent Youmans and a negro spiritual
: or two, but they don't slow up the
lively cadence of the picture.
Tibbett proves himself excellent
in a comedy role as a knight of the
road, black sheep of a proud South
ern family.
Sparkling dialogue, a story with
I only minor let-downs and a stellar
supporting cast combine to make
this an unusually bright comedy.
Esther Ralston, Cliff Edwards,
, Hedda Hopper, Stepin Fetehit, and
Roland Young are included in the
1 cast. —L. M. C.
