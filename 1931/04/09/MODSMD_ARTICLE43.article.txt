## WHAT! A TRACK MEET? 
### 
Bears meet Trojans Saturday
in the Los Angeles Coliseum; yet
Indians and their most rabid
supporters slumber on in a
week-end of rest, scarcely open
ing one eye long enough to read
about it! "Who cares?" seems to
be the Slanfordian attitude. And
after all, why not? This is a
condition peculiar to track, per
fectly natural to this generation
of collegiate fans, who have
never seen a powerful Dlue and
(•old team, and never a weak
C rom we 11 - coached outfit.

The true spirit of the eternal tri
angle is missing. The third party is
standing by with a yawn while the
other two concerned publicly an
nounce that they intend to keep an
engagement Saturday! Perhaps some
of the habitual haunters of that
Southern stadium will view with a
sigh the rows upon rows of empty
.seat as their thoughts turn back to
contrast a meagre turnout with the
thrill-fired throng which jammed
the Coliseum one autumn day in
1929. Bears versus Trojans was the
cry which attracted the mob, but
the clash was on the gridiron, be
tween two undefeated teams.
Plenty of cardinal-liucd sweat
was lost around these parts over
the outcome of that tussle, for
the team that won was the
eleven for Warner to beat. The
Bears triumphed, yet the Tro
jans wrecked Pop's powerful
machine later, to put California
in the favored spot for coast
conference honors. Then came
the Big (lame, a glorious 21 to 0
rout of the Golden Bear which
astounded expert and sucker
alike. What a balanced Big
Three that was!
Not only is Saturday's U.C.-U.S.C.
track and field meeting so far into
the Red and Gold burlap that no
body is losing any sleep, but the sad
affair won't even give the Stanford
U. tuilion payers a particle of Trojan
dope to add to their Indian-Troy
score sheets. Mr. Dean Cromwell
will acquire another dual meet by a
copious margin without excessive
wear and tear on his athletes.
To add to the mystery, the few
(vents in which California is
strong are just those in which
Troy is weak. Disciples of the
Templeton tause already know
that Cromwell's men are not
much in the two mile or the
javelin. "Iron man" Spud Moss
man will carry his Blue and
Child jersey across the finish line
of the eight lap grind, yards
ahead of the field. Churchill's
worst javelin throw of the sea
son would take a first.
And where the Trojans are said
to have plenty of power, but have
not exhibited it yet this season, U.C.
is lamentably anemic. There is no
one to test the 1931 caliber of
Cromwell's well-known hurdlers,
Stokes, Payne, Carls, and Bills. No
Boar athlete can push Vic Williams
in the quarter to let the world know
if that star is going to be as good
against the Indians as he was last
year.
The pole vault, however, might
develop into something of a hat
tie, with Poole and Vantress of
the Bears bringing to light some
unexpected Trojan talent in
Chlcntzos and Graber of S.C.,
both capable of l.'J feet. It would
be news if one of them could
add about half a dozen inches
to this, but better no news than
bad news! —Crawford.

thrill-fired throng which jammed
the Coliseum one autumn day in
1929. Bears versus Trojans was the
cry which attracted the mob, but
the clash was on the gridiron, be
tween two undefeated teams.
Plenty of cardinal-liucd sweat
was lost around these parts over
the outcome of that tussle, for
the team that won was the
eleven for Warner to beat. The
Bears triumphed, yet the Tro
jans wrecked Pop's powerful
machine later, to put California
in the favored spot for coast
conference honors. Then came
the Big (lame, a glorious 21 to 0
rout of the Golden Bear which
astounded expert and sucker
alike. What a balanced Big
Three that was!
Not only is Saturday's U.C.-U.S.C.
track and field meeting so far into
the Red and Gold burlap that no
body is losing any sleep, but the sad
affair won't even give the Stanford
U. tuilion payers a particle of Trojan
dope to add to their Indian-Troy
score sheets. Mr. Dean Cromwell
will acquire another dual meet by a
copious margin without excessive
wear and tear on his athletes.
To add to the mystery, the few
(vents in which California is
strong are just those in which
Troy is weak. Disciples of the
Templeton tause already know
that Cromwell's men are not
much in the two mile or the
javelin. "Iron man" Spud Moss
man will carry his Blue and
Child jersey across the finish line
of the eight lap grind, yards
ahead of the field. Churchill's
worst javelin throw of the sea
son would take a first.
And where the Trojans are said
to have plenty of power, but have
not exhibited it yet this season, U.C.
is lamentably anemic. There is no
one to test the 1931 caliber of
Cromwell's well-known hurdlers,
Stokes, Payne, Carls, and Bills. No
Boar athlete can push Vic Williams
in the quarter to let the world know
if that star is going to be as good
against the Indians as he was last
year.
The pole vault, however, might
develop into something of a hat
tie, with Poole and Vantress of
the Bears bringing to light some
unexpected Trojan talent in
Chlcntzos and Graber of S.C.,
both capable of l.'J feet. It would
be news if one of them could
add about half a dozen inches
to this, but better no news than
bad news! —Crawford.
Bears meet Trojans Saturday
in the Los Angeles Coliseum; yet
Indians and their most rabid
supporters slumber on in a
week-end of rest, scarcely open
ing one eye long enough to read
about it! "Who cares?" seems to
be the Slanfordian attitude. And
after all, why not? This is a
condition peculiar to track, per
fectly natural to this generation
of collegiate fans, who have
never seen a powerful Dlue and
(•old team, and never a weak
C rom we 11 - coached outfit.

The true spirit of the eternal tri
angle is missing. The third party is
standing by with a yawn while the
other two concerned publicly an
nounce that they intend to keep an
engagement Saturday! Perhaps some
of the habitual haunters of that
Southern stadium will view with a
sigh the rows upon rows of empty
.seat as their thoughts turn back to
contrast a meagre turnout with the
thrill-fired throng which jammed
