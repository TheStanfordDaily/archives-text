# Eastman, 'Tired', Runs Quarter in 48 Seconds
## WEARY LEGS FAIL TO SLOW TIME OF SOPHMORE STAR Hables, Brown, Giberson, And Shove Turn In Creditable Time 
### Lowell Cox 
I "How do you feel today, Ben?"
Dink Templeton asked his blond 440
ace yesterday afternoon.
"Not so peppy as Monday," re
plied Eastman, who had reeled off
i the quarter-mile in 48.2 seconds
i against a wind the day before.
I "Well, see what you can do any
way," said Dink.
Whereupon the weary Eastman
toddled around the one lap in a
mere 48 seconds flat, the fastest time
he has ever made in his favorite
event.
Since the blond runner traversed
the distance alone, there is no telling
what mark he might have set had
he been pushed. That he will get
i under 48 flat this season seems a
! certainty, as he has been steadily
lowering his time for the event.
Dink Puzzled
I This same Eastman is proving a
puzzle to Dink, who is undecided
1 as to how to use him in-the forth
coming Bear and Trojan meets. Hav
; ing run the half-mile last week in
| the sensational time of 1:52.6, Ben
; proved himself more than capable
j of taking first in that event from Bill
| McGeagh, Trojan two-lap man.
, Hence Eastman is sure to run the
half against U.S.C., but Templeton
i is in doubt as to whether to put him
• in the 440 or the relay for his second
! event.
Will Run 410
As for the Bear encounter, it is
i probable that the spectacled sopho
| more will run his regular 440 and
relay events, although Templeton
I indicated last night that he might
put him in the half instead of one
! of these to try him out.
There is no rest for the weary
these days, the Card track mentor
; sending his charges through one
J tough session after another. He in
tends to keep up the strenuous work
i at least until the end of the week.
Templeton spent considerable time
j with the hurdlers yesterday, drilling
! them on starts and form. In a prac
tice heat in the high sticks Brugman
provided a surprise by nosing out
j Captain Podge Smith in 15 seconds
flat, the others trailing well behind.
Good Times Checked
Besides Eastman's mark in the
quarter, the other three members of
the relay team turned in creditable
| times. Hables was clocked in 49.6,
i Shove in 50 flat, and Giberson in 52
■ flat.
Bob Brown negotiated the mile in
4:28.6, running alone.
Commenting on the coming Cali
fornia tangle, Templeton said he saw
nothing about the Bear record this
' year to become excited about, in
; spite of dire predictions by one
! "Brick" Morse.
