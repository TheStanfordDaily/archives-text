# POSSIBLE BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAKE IN REMAINING CALIFORNIA GAMES
## 
### FRANCIS LLOYD 
< Sensing a very possible California '
intercollegiate baseball champion
ship for the first time since the
] formation of the present association,
' Stanford's varsity nine is settling
i down to remove the greatest barrier j
in its way—Clint Evans' squad of
j diamond artists from Berkeley.
By taking the series from the
Bears, tlie Cards would have only
to v. in their two . remaining games'
with San Francisco University and i
one with U.C.L.A. to be assured of
at least a tie for the title—in spite of
dropping one of the series tilts wilh
California.
Three W ins Will Aid Cause
Were Stanford to win all three
games from the trans-bay outfit, ,
however, chances for the pennant !
1 would skyrocket. Although there is I
many a slip between third and I
home, the Indians should not have 1
much difficulty with the Gray Fog
or Bruins. The main item on the
debit side is the brace of contests
remaining with California.
At present writing, Dan Johnson
seems a cinch to start both contests
for the Redshirts. Whether the Stan
ford ace will last cut the eighteen ,
innings or not is another matter. !

By FRANCIS LLOYD

The showing of the three sopho
mores on the first string this year,
by the way, is gratifying, to say the
i least. Little comment need be made
of Pitcher Johnson. Burt Delmas,
regular shortstop, has developed
i into a hard-hitting batter and a
steady fielder whose peg to first base
is seldom inaccurate. Ike Livermorc,
the last of the trio, alternates with
Miller behind the plate and is slow
ly finding his batting eye, throws
well to the bases, and seldom al
lows a slant to get away from him.
Now that the first California game
is past history, it may be expected
that the Indians will be in a calmer
frame of mind for the second one
here Saturday. Especially during
i the last inning of the game with the
Bears last week did the nervous
ness of the Cardinal nine become
apparent. With a first victory in
j four years within their grasp, how
ever, the Redshirts can hardly be
blamed for playing on pins and
needles during the last three outs.
It Philippi and Hunken climb out
of their batting, slumps, and John
son continues to fool the California
batsmen, there is no reason why a
,baseball championship might not
I come to the Farm.

Bears, tlie Cards would have only
to v. in their two . remaining games'
with San Francisco University and i
one with U.C.L.A. to be assured of
at least a tie for the title—in spite of
dropping one of the series tilts wilh
California.
Three W ins Will Aid Cause
Were Stanford to win all three
games from the trans-bay outfit, ,
however, chances for the pennant !
1 would skyrocket. Although there is I
many a slip between third and I
home, the Indians should not have 1
much difficulty with the Gray Fog
or Bruins. The main item on the
debit side is the brace of contests
remaining with California.
At present writing, Dan Johnson
seems a cinch to start both contests
for the Redshirts. Whether the Stan
ford ace will last cut the eighteen ,
innings or not is another matter. !

The showing of the three sopho
mores on the first string this year,
by the way, is gratifying, to say the
i least. Little comment need be made
of Pitcher Johnson. Burt Delmas,
regular shortstop, has developed
i into a hard-hitting batter and a
steady fielder whose peg to first base
is seldom inaccurate. Ike Livermorc,
the last of the trio, alternates with
Miller behind the plate and is slow
ly finding his batting eye, throws
well to the bases, and seldom al
lows a slant to get away from him.
Now that the first California game
is past history, it may be expected
that the Indians will be in a calmer
frame of mind for the second one
here Saturday. Especially during
i the last inning of the game with the
Bears last week did the nervous
ness of the Cardinal nine become
apparent. With a first victory in
j four years within their grasp, how
ever, the Redshirts can hardly be
blamed for playing on pins and
needles during the last three outs.
It Philippi and Hunken climb out
of their batting, slumps, and John
son continues to fool the California
batsmen, there is no reason why a
,baseball championship might not
I come to the Farm.
< Sensing a very possible California '
intercollegiate baseball champion
ship for the first time since the
] formation of the present association,
' Stanford's varsity nine is settling
i down to remove the greatest barrier j
in its way—Clint Evans' squad of
j diamond artists from Berkeley.
By taking the series from the
Bears, tlie Cards would have only
to v. in their two . remaining games'
with San Francisco University and i
one with U.C.L.A. to be assured of
at least a tie for the title—in spite of
