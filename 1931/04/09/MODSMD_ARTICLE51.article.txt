# FRESHMAN TRICK TEAM HAS CHANCE TO DEFEAT BEARS
## Annual Little Big Meet Is Slated For Berkeley Oval Tomorrow 
### 
"Our chances are good," was the
prediction hazarded yesterday by
Freshman Track Coach Bill Elling
ton about his team's meeting with
the California frosh at Berkeley.
Comparison of the two team rec
ords shows little except that both
are strong aggregations, because
neither team has had a mutual op
ponent.
Bear Cubs Win Two
Meeting San Francisco State
Teachers College in their initial
contest, the California frosh took an
80-41 decision. Their only other
meet, that with an all-star organiza
tion picked from the squads of Ala
meda, Berkeley, and Piedmont high
schools, resulted in a 78-70 victory
for the Bears.
The Stanford frosh downed the
San Francisco All-Stars 83-47 to
open the season, and dropped a close
58-68 meet to Sacramento Junior
College in the second. Facing Menlo
and Pasadena in their third meet,
the frosh took a 61-51-42 win. San
Jose State Teachers took them down
the line 79-52 last Saturday.
Bears Have Star Sprinters
Outstanding figures on the Bear
Cub team are their great trio of
sprinters, Kiesel, Kilfoil, and Van
Lobensels, the "ten-second men."
John Lyman, former state inter
scholastic champion and record
holder in the 12-pound shot, is the
most outstanding performer on the
Card squad. He has tossed the 16-
pound shot 48 feet in competition
this year, enough to worry Cali
fornia's varsity man.
Captain David Packard is also ex
pected to cut quite a figure for the
Indians. Crack high and low hur
dler, he also tosses the discus 135
feet, high jumps 5 feet 9 inches, and
broad jumps over 21 feet.
