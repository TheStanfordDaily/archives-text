# FRESHMAN RACKET SQUAD PLAYS BEAR OUTFIT SATURDAY
## 
### 
To climax a highly successful sea
son, the Stanford babe netmen will
meet California on the local courts
Saturday morning. After a season
in which they defeated San Fran
cisco University's freshmen and
Piedmont High, the yearlings are set
for the coming encounter*â€”the Little
Big matches.
Chuck Otis, star performer from
Pasadena High, will lead the fresh
men into Saturday's struggle. Otis,
one of the best freshman racquet
wielders on the coast, is almost cer
tain to cop the feature match since
California's first man has previously
fallen before the local star.

Ranchers near Marfa, Texas, char
tered a plane to hunt down eagles
preying on sheep and goats.
