# ORDERS FOR SENIOR PROGRAMS MUST BE FILED, SAYS LOOMIS
## 
### 
Orders for senior programs and
announcements must be placed im
mediately at the stationery counter
of the Bookstore if members of the
graduating class desire to have them
filled, according to Vard Loomis,
senior class president. The time limit
was set by the publishing company
and no orders can be filled after
the closing date.
The programs will contain a
schedule of the activities of Senior
Week, the names of the members of
the graduating class and of students
receiving advanced degrees, and the
personnel of the various senior com
mittees.
Aside from being a most useful
asset for Senior Week, they should
prove excellent souvenirs, Loomis
says. They will be made of brown
suede leather with a design of the |
Chapel on the cover.
