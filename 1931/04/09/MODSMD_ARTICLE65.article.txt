# THREE EX-MAYORS RACE FOR COUNCIL
## 
### 
MONTEREY, Apr. 8 (JP).â€”A po- I
litical situation presumably without I
precedent in California municipal
campaigns developed here today
when three former mayors of Mon
terey became candidates for council
men at the election to be held
May 11.
The candidates are:
Carmel Martin, mayor from 1911
to 1913 and for years head of the j
Union High School District Board of
Trustees; P. J. Dougherty, mayor
from 1919 to 1923 and a business
leader; and B. F. Wright, mayor
from 1923 to 1925 and a capitalist.
Three places on the council are to
be filled and as none of the ex
mayors has ever been defeated each
feels certain of success.
