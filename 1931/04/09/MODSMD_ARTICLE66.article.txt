# ROCKNE'S INSURANCE MAY CAUSE LAWSUIT
## 
### 
SOUTH BEND, Ind., April 8 f.-Tl â€”
Litigation over clauses in life insur
ance policies held by Knute Rockne
appeared likely after his will was
filed for probate today.
The entire estate, termed "very
modest" aside from the insurance
policies which were estimated to
total approximately $125,00 was left
to the v/idow, Mrs. Bonnie G.
Rockne.
Vitus E. -Jones, attorney for the
estate of the famous coach who lost
his life in an airplane tragedy last
week, indicated that litigation might
ensue over the question of whether
double indemnity should be paid on
some of the policies.
Plans for a memorial to Rockne
were progressing, but James E.
Armstrong, secretary of the Notre
Dame Alumni Association, said the
committee was not yet in a position
to decide what form it would take.
