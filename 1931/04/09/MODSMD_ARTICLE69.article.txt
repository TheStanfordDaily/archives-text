| Coach Murray Cuddeback's squad
J of yearling ball players will leave j
the Farm for the first time this year i
when they journey to Berkeley Sat
urday to meet the Bear Cubs in the j
second encounter of the Little Big i
Series.
Stan Anderson should be in ex- j
; cellent shape after a week's rest.
; Massey, fiery catcher, took a lay-off ;
; during Tuesday's game with Menlo, !
; being handicapped with a spiked i
finger, but he will be ready for duty
|on Saturday.
Cuddeback is finding a dearth of
| outfield material, having lost the
services of Sutrow through sickness
land Panero through ineligibility.
Dodge, Goldmann, and Miles held |
1 down the positions against Califor- j
nia last Saturday, with Buller dis- i
j placing Dodge while the latter was j
i backstopping for Savinskc against
