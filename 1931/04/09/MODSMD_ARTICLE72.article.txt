# PALO ALTO PLAY IS BEING DIRECTED BY HAROLD HELVENSTON
## 
### 
Harold Helvenston is directing the
annual Junior League play which
will be given at the Community
Playhouse today, tomorrow, and the
day following. This is the first time
that a Stanford dramatic coach has
been chosen for this position instead
of a commercial producer in San
Francisco.
In addition to directing the play
Helvenston has designed the five
sets which will be used. Particularly
interesting about this production,
according to Helvenston, is that the
cast, composed entirely of adults, is
producing the play primarily for
children's entertainment.
