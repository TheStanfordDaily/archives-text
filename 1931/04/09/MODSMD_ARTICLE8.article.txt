### 
AfKEN, S.C., April 8. (/P) —In the cheery, colonial home of James F.
Curtis here, Nicholas Longworth, Speaker of the House of Representa
tives, tonight continued his fight against pneumonia.
Physicians announced his condition was "satisfactory" and said he was
resting comfortably. Mrs. Longworth was at her husband's bedside. l)r.
R. H. Wilds, of Aiken, made a statement as to the patient's condition,

r-r—" "
§>saying there had been no extension
I of the disease. The malady is in the
) right lung, he said.
However, just how serious the
Speaker's condition is, and what
chances he has to recover, were
subjects on which the physician
! would not commit himself. The gen
eral physical condition was pro
nounced "very good."
Oxygen Tent Used
Speaker Longworth contracted a
cold last week, became ill Monday,
| and that night was found to have
| pneumonia.
Mrs. Longworth brought with her
a nurse from Baltimore, Miss Eliza
beth Nelson, who supplements the
staff of four nurses assigned to the
case.
Physicians are using an oxygen
tent in treatment of the Speaker.
Dr. Wilds described it as one of the
newest methods of combatting the
disease. Dr. Wilds said a crisis might
| come within three to nine days but
| that there might be no crisis at all.
j In certain cases, he explained, the
patient grows gradually better with
out reaching a crisis.
