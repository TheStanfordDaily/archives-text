### 
A new powerful short-wave radio
' broadcasting station will be com
pleted and ready for operation by
the end of the spring quarter by the

night at a meeting of the club held
in the Engineering Building.
It is planned that the work will
be carried on by members of the
club working in daily shifts under
the supervision of Dr. F. E. Terman
:of the Electrical Engineering de
partment. Phil Caldwell and Paul
Byrne, both electrical engineering
graduate students, will have charge
of the technical details.
The new transmitter will embody
I the latest improvements in radio de
sign including a crystal control, and
will be built to work on the two
wave-lengths assigned to amateur
radiophone stations by the Federal
Radio Commission, 20 and 80 meters.
Besides using voice transmission on
these wave-lengths, the station will
transmit telegraphic code signals on
three wave-lengths, 20, 40, and 80
