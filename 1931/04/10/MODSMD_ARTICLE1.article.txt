# STANFORD NINE GIVEN EDGE IN U.C. STRUGGLE
## Win Tomorrow Will Give Indians First Series In Five Years TOUGH GAME PROMISED Wolter Will Use Johnson-Miller Battery 
### Francis Lloyd 
Keyed with the prospect of win
ning its first California series in
five .years, Stanford's baseball var
sity will go on the field tomorrow
with a little better than an even
chance to win. The game with the
Bears is scheduled to start at 2:30
o'clock on the local diamond.
Even though the Cards took the
first game at Berkeley last Satur
day, the score of 3-2 clearly shows
that it was anybody's ball game up
to the last put out. Norm Horner,
who is slated to oppose the Redshirts
on the mound again tomorrow, is a
difficult man to defeat at any time
as any Stanford baseball player of
the last three years will testify.
Johnson Set for Contest
Having gained in himself that
extra bit of confidence which goes to
make great athletes when he turned
down the Bears in their first en
counter, Dan Johnson, who will be
in the box for the Indians, should
be prepared to give the best pitch
ing exhibition he has shown this
year.
Although Harry Wolter usually
has to worry about his pitching,
with Johnson toeing the slab this
worry is minimized, and the hitting
af the Cards becomes the principal
problem. Hunken, Philippi, and
Hardy have not batted up to their
2arly season form in the last few
lames, which means that one-third
jf the batting order is comparatively
neffective.
Miller Receiving
By his triple in the second inning
ast Saturday, Art Miller helped ma
erially in the final favorable out
come for the Indians. Miller is
dated to be on the receiving end of
lohnson's fast slants when the game
s called tomorrow. The rest of the
ineup will be the same.
Garrulousness on the part of Kir
van cost the Bears a possible run
vhen Burt Delmas engaged him in
1 heated argument so that Dan
fohnson and Philippi were able to
ag out the Bear short stop. Un
loubtedly Clint Evans has warned
lis men against the clanger of talk
ng to strange young men.
Mclntyre Dangerous
Collecting three out of four hits
;i the first Stanford - California
ame, Mclntyre showed himself to
ie a really dangerous threat every
me he comes to the plate. The
roblem of how to stop the big left
elder's hitting will be one of the
lings Dan Johnson and Miller will
ave to solve if the Indians are to
e assured of a victory.
Proving that they can play error
\ss ball, the Redshirts, by their
lowing last Saturday, have set
lemselvcs a high standard to du
licate in tomorrow's game. Fans
n the Farm should be given a treat
y the performances of Woltcr's in
eld, which has stood out all season
i one of the best outfits in the
ague.
