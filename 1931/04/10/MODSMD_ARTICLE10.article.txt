# KPO-UNIVERSITY BROADCAST SET
## Speeches, Stanford Songs To Feature Hour 
### 
Making a widespread attempt to
attract more alumni to the campus
for University Day, a radio program
will be broadcast over station KPO
on Sunday afternoon, April 12, be
tween the hours of 4 and 5 o'clock.
Music by the Stanford Band and
Glee Club will fill the space in the
hour program between the speeches
of Acting President Robert E. Swain,
Frank V. Keesling, '98, chairman of
University Day, and Roy Reppy, '02.
According to Alumni Secretary
John E. McDowell, his office is
counting on the program to build up
interest in the activities planned for
University Day, which will be out
lined by the speakers, and to induce
all alumni to make a more deter
mined effort to return for the day.
The KPO broadcast will be the
first experiment of its kind ever to
be attempted by the University au
thorities in connection with its
alumni reunion program.
The complete program for the day
has now been announced to include
all the features that were origi
nally planned. There will be tours
of the campus in the morning to all
the new additions to the University
plant under the leadership of stu
dent guides, winding up with a dem
onstration at the at the Ryan Labo
ratory.
After the barbecue at noon, the
visitors are expected to attend the
Big Meet and the last game of the
Big Series in baseball. Late in the
afternoon will come the alumnae tea
and band concert in the Union court,
to be followed by the alumni dinner
and all-University dance in the
Women's gym.
