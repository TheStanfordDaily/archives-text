## 
### 
Returning alumni wlil be made to j
feel at home on University Day by
re-enacting the time-worn process
of registration. Mock matriculation
books, printed to look exactly like
the conventional first-day booklets,
give accurate parodies on every fa- ,

for all books not turned in yester

As for fees on 22z: "Fee fifo fum,"
said the Cashier. "Make checks pay

a fine of $2.00 for shoving off bounc
