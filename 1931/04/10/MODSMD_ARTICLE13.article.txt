# PIONEER MAN OF STANFORD FACULTY DIES
## Dr. Stuart W. Young Dies After Brief Illness Of Pneumonia 
### 
Dr. Stuart W. Young, Professor of
Physical Chemistry, died last night
at 7:30 o'clock in the Palo Alto Hos
pital. Doctors held no hope for his
recovery from pneumonia after 12
o'clock yesterday.

He was taken to the hospital the
day before yesterday in a serious
condition that was probably the re
sult of influenza which he contracted
over a week ago. He had been in
poor health ever since he underwent
a serious operation about three
years ago. Since then he recovered
sufficiently to carry on a research
project.
Since 1893 Professor Young has
been a member of the Stanford fac
ulty, coming to the coast the year
after Dr. Jordan opened the Uni
versity. He was the last of the fam
ous "old guard" of the chemistry
department, which included such
professors as John M. # Stillman,
George M. Richardson, and John L.
Lennox, all of whom died during
the last few years.
Orient, New York, was the town
where Dr. Young was born on
March 14, 1869. He received his B.S.
from Cornell in 1890 and studied a
year abroad. During the next year
he held his first instructorship at his
alma mater. Then until 1893 he
taught at Swarthmore.
He is survived by his sister, Mrs.
Mable Mattice of Long Island, and
a niece, ,Mrs. William Burke, who
lives in California. He has no im
mediate family. Funeral arrange
ments will be made as soon as Mrs.
Burke arrives fcorn southern Cali
fornia.
