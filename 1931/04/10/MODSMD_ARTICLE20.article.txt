# DRIBBLE SAVED FOR CAGE GAME
## Coaches Vote For Saving Tip-Off Says Bunn 
### 
The dribble and the tip-off at cen
ter will stay in the game of basket
ball. Such is the opinion of Coach
John Bunn who has just returned
from the annual convention of the
National Association of Basketball
Coaches held in New York.

In spite of agitation during the
past year for the abolition of these
features, sentiment at the coaches
convention crystallized against any
changes in the dribble or tip-off, the
majority feeling that the interest
contributed by these departments of
the game could not be obtained
through any substitutes.

The only recommendation for a
major rule change made by the
coaches was to eliminate blocking
by making it illegal in any form.
According to Bunn, this recommen
dation will probably be adopted by
the national rules committee, which
is now in session in New York. Of
the California teams, U.S.C. is the
only one which would be affected
by such a change, Bunn says, since
the Trojans are the only team using
a blocking offense.
Stanford will be directly inter
ested in some experiments proposed
by the convention which Bunn plans
to try out here. One innovation is
to raise the height of the baskets to
12 feet. The side baskets in the
Pavilion have been placed at that
height, and the basketball classes
will use them this spring to see
what effect they will have on the
game.
Another proposal is to abolish the
free-throw after a foul. Advocates
claim that it would speed up the
game to allow the person fouled to
shoot or pass from the spot where
the foul occurred. Bunn intends to
try this system in practice games
this spring.
