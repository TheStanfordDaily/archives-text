# ENTIRE NATION MOURNS DEATH OF LONGWORTH
## Special Train To Transport Hoover To Cincinnati For Services FUNERAL ON SATURDAY House Will Send Delegation Of Colleagues 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 9. (/P)
Today, by executive order, the
American flag atop the White House
swung at half mast, a mute symbol
of the nation's loss, paying a final
homage to Nicholas Longworth, who
succumbed this morning at Aiken,
South Caorlina, to pneumonia after
a valiant battle against the ravages
of the disease.
Mrs. Alice Roosevelt Longworth,
widow of the veteran Republican
leader, made arrangements by long
distance telephone with the Speak
er's office at Washington to have
the body taken directly to Cincin
nati, where services will be held
Saturday afternoon.
Condolences Sent
Numerous officials and private
citizens, as soon as Longworth's
death became known, wired their
condolences to Mrs. Longworth.
Many of them planned to journey
to Cincinnati to join President
Hoover at Longworth's funeral.
This kindly, debonair, dignified
gentleman was loved by political
friend and foe alike. His amazing
vitality, physicians said, alone kept
him alive during last night. At his
bedside were his wife, the former
Alice Roosevelt, and his friend, Mrs.
James F. Curtis, at whose home he
had contracted the disease.
Harvard Graduate
Born with wealth and position at
Cincinnati on November 5, 1869, he
attended the public schools there,
and afterwards graduated from Har
vard.
In 1902 he was elected to the 58th
congress where, colleagues said, ho
soon showed his natural aptitude in
political affairs by successfully
serving on the Foreign Affairs com
mittee.
Since then his rise was meteoric,
eventually placing him in the Speak
er's chair of the House.
The House of Representatives,
which he has faithfully served for
28 years, will send a delegation to
Cincinnati to tender their final
homages.
