# THE 						UNIVERSITY OF INVERNESS
## 
### 
A short while ago it wns proposed that a million dollars'
he spent at Harvard University for the erection of a warj
memorial chapel. Vigorous and proper protests against
this expenditure for the sanctification of war were voiced
hv the Harvard Crimson and the Yale Daih/ Xetvs, ami
other student newspapers.
Another, ami infinitely more worth while, way of spend-1
ing a million dollars was revealed recently in the an
nouncement of a proposed new university to he built all
Inverness, Scotland, by Americans. A group of Americans I
has organized the American lona Society, which will build
the new university as a tribute of gratitude for Scotland's!
contributions to the United States. The preliminary camâ€”
paign is lor the first of ten millions of dollars which will!
be spent on the university at Inverness.
Professor John Lawrence Gcrig, who teaches Celtic at
Columbia t niversity, and who is an officer of the new
society, said: "It would be most regrettable if, in the amal
gamation of cultures toward which all nations are tending,
the beautiful and romantic tradition of the Celt should!
disappear from the face of the earth." The new university I
will he of great value, not only in the education of Scot-j
land, but in the preserving of Scottish culture and litera
ture, and in the keeping of "the beautiful and romantic
tradition."
Far, far better than the spending of a million dollars!
for the greater deification of the god of war, is this move j
to spend a million dollars for a material addition to the
institutions of higher education of Scotland, in a way
which must inevitably draw two peoples on opposing sides
of the Atlantic in closer sympathy. When the great uni-j
versities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. An
drews find in their company the new University of Inver-

ness they will be sensible to America's appreciation of!
Scottish contributions to the growth of this nation.
