Thompson in his flight for re-election as Chicago's mayor.'
the Chicago Tribune has remarked, in pari, as follows:
"For Chicago, Thomson has meant filth, corruption, ob
scenity, idiocy and bankruptcy. He has given the city an
international reputation for moronic buffoonery, barbaric
i rime, triumphant hoodlumism, unchecked graft, and a
dejected citizenship. ... lie leaves office and goes from the,
city the most discredited man who ever held place in it."
The Tribune leaves little room for doubt as to what it
thinks of Mayor Thompson. The editorial is reminiscent
of the old days when journalism was a personal affair.
The thing for Thompson to do now is to reply, through the
