# BULL SESSION
## WHY DO OR DIE FOR THE "OLD RED"? 
### 
During 1 allies some of our over
heated alumni are always tellings us
to get out and fight for the team,
and thus show our glorious school
spirit. According to these repre
sentatives of the age when men
were men, anybody who hasn't the
spirit to sit in the bleachers and
strain vocal cords while Doakes of
the Farm plunges this way and that,
is a traitor to the University. Some
of these old graduates advocate that
such a spineless man who failed to
spend sleepless nights wondering if
"Old Bill" would smack that line
should be shot at sunrise, or even a
little before; while some of the less
blood-thirsty feel that expulsion
would be a fit enough penalty.
Now personally, we enjoy piling
out of bed and risking pneumonia,
splinters, and several other things
in a drafty Encina lobby to view
several pounds of sacred steel that
used to be on a nice big stick. We
derive amusement in getting hoarse
(or nearly so) at rallies—and even
risking the possibility of contracting
athlete's foot—"though we only sit
in the bleachers."
We indulge in all these practices
because we enjoy them and not be
cause we are ready to do or die
for the "old red" or any other color.
The other students who act simi
larly, do so because they derive en
joyment from such pursuits. In giv-

I ing, love of University or "school
spirit" as a reason, they are in real
ity presenting idle excuses. If we
all act thlisly because of purely
| selfish motives, we are not justified
in criticizing, condemning, harassing,
! and persecuting those fellow stu
dents who do not go to rallies or
i games.
The. person on this campus who
■ does not turn out to see the Stan
j ford boys push the lads from "over
there" all over the lot is considered
I a montsrosity in the common mind.
It may be, however, that this is the
! type of student that is to be emu
! lated and praised. When one real
i izes that (strange as it may sound
lin this day) colleges were not
: founded to make desirable sites for
I stadiums—when one realizes that
the sheep-skin preceded the pig
j skin by many years, it may be very
! possible that the person who thinks
I football boring, and organized yell
ing an insult to college intelligence
I is the better college man.
\ School spirit is stimulating if true.
| School spirit is desirable if not
| forced by commercial ballyhoo.
| School spirit does not have to rest
j on the athletic prowess of our teams,
i The student whose loyalty to Stan
ford is grounded on a higher plane
than football (and there are some
I such students) is to be placed in
! high regard.
