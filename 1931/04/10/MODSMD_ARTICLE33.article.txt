WOMEN AND CHILDREN LAST.
By Beverly Nichols. Doubleday,
Doran, 1931. ($2.50 at the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
"Women and Children Last" is a
collection of scathing essays of the
j sort that will probably make the
average man wonder and the aver
| age woman boil with rage and in
ijured pride. The author in his inimi
, table light style sets out to debunk
j women, their various mysteries and
poses and though no-one but a wo
man could tell whether he is telling
the truth, it all sounds very con
j vincing.
The book is guaranteed to annoy
anyone above the age of sixty be
cause of the author's deadly and
, outspoken detestation of all that is
old-fashioned and mid-victorian in
! character. Nichols gained an un
savory reputation in this country
! amongst "101 Pei -cent" Americans
by reason of one of his former
. books, "The Star Spangled Manner."
He may not always be right, he is
i sometimes prone to exaggeration,
but he is always stimulating and

! frequently amusing in an ultra
sophisticated manner. —S. C. A.
ONCE IN A LIFETIME—At the
Cur ran Theatre.
Lampooning the introduction of
, talking pictures to Hollywood, filled
| with satire on current entertainers,
I "Once In A Lifetime" is an hilarious
! comedy.
j There is a story of three unfor
j tunate members of the legitiniate
; stage as a basic plot. They open an
! elocution school, with much bluffing.
■ Failure — the "dumb" member
j of the trio is just slow enough to
; become the genius of picture direc
; tion, and revolutionize the industry,
i bringing "the sweet simplicity of
! 1910 to the hearts of Hollywood."
As a relief from purely riotous
! farce, the quiet, charming wit of
! Aline MacMahon, who plays the part
I of Mae Daniels, her not too obvious
love for Jerry, the excellent blend
| ing of satire and just amusement,
i rounds out the Hart, Kauffman play,
j and make it one of the best theatre
productions to reach San Francisco
I for many months. —J. N.
