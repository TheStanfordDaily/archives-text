A STELLAR TRO
Individual battles featuring
three Indian stars in as many
fields of sport furnish the spice
in the athletic morsel to be
served to hero-worshipping in
habitants of the Farm this week
end. Swiming pool, ball diamond,
and golf links will make up the
scenery for the aforementioned
duels.
Austin Clapp, merman par excel
lence, takes the leading role for the
Stanford cause in Encina pool Sat
urday morning, when he faces Bus
ter Crabbe, the Trojan satellite. Be
tween them, these two men hold a
(lock of records sufficient to warrant
envy by any large-sized fish.
Recently in the East this pair
had ii out for the middle dis
tance intercollegiate titles. Clapp
chased Crabbe for 440 yards of
free-style paddling, failing to
catch him by a few scant feet.
Crabbe, resenting the pursuit,
reversed the procedure in the
finishing right on the heels
of the cardinal-clad flash. Aus
tin, still not satisfied, later added
the 500-yard college crown to
his collection.
That some personal animosity ex
ists between these stellar mermen
has been reported, hinting of grudge
competition to delight the hearts of
the bloodthirsty fans here Saturday.
Though details are missing, accounts
if the Troy-Stanford water-polo
contest at Los Angeles on the 21st
jf last month show the undeniable
"ruth. Clapp and Crabbe were taken
uut of that tussle simultaneously by
lie referee, to remain on the side
ines for the remainder of the game!
The fate of Harry Wolter's
red-socked nine against the
Hears here Saturday leans very
heavily on the shoulders of
Pitcher I):m Johnson. Pitcher
Norm Horner of the Bears will
spare no effort to reverse the
decision he lost to Johnson last
week on his home grounds.
Both are luuTers sweet enough
to put the hatting assignments
for the day in a decidedly un
enviable light.
Wolter's sophomore ace probably
ias the edge, though the Blue and
Jold veteran is nobody's sucker. De
lending largely on perfect control
nd not a little stuff on the ball,
lorner has baffled Stanfodd batters
or two years, and in this, his last
eason, he will be doubly anxious to
ake the remaining brace df tilts,
ohfis&n's deadly effectiveness de
ends largely on a fast ball, which
e makes even more confusing by
n occasional slow one. Dan isn't so
ad at breaking them across the
orners, either!
Malcolm MacNaugton is looked to
s Stanford's chief threat in the
lorthern California amateur golf
mrney slated for Lake Merced
Country Club. Herb Shultz, from
cross the bay, Mac's defeated rival
f last week's minor sports carnival
lay over the local coirrse, will also
e battling for honors when the
ualifying round begins today.
Shultz is defending his title
in this tourney, and it is more
than a possibility that he and
MacNaughton meet in the finals.
Though the Indian bright light
took a <> and 5 decision over
Shultz here, the pair finished the
morning round only one stroke
apart, with cards of 72 and 73.
Without the home course advan
tage 1 . MacNaughton might find
Shultz his equal on the Merced
layout. At any rate, watch for a
battle royal if this match ma
terializes. â€”Crawford.
