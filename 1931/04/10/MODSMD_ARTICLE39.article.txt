# BABE BULL TEAM DOPED TO CLINCH BEAR SERIES TILT
## Anderson, Massey Slated Frosh Nine Battery In Game Saturday 
### 
Conceded an excellent chance of
clinching the series by taking their
j second game from California, Coach
Murray Cuddeback's freshman nine
will leave the Farm Saturday morn
; ing for Berkeley, where they are
' scheduled to tangle with the Bear
Cub crew at 1 o'clock.
Stan Anderson is slated to do the
hurling for the Indian Babes with
Massey on the receiving end of his
offerings. Hearn at first base; Joe
! Robinson, second; Macntz, short;
and Buller on third are probable
j starters in the infield. As for the
, outfield positions, the slugging duo
of Goldmann and Dick Miles seem
j sure to open the game, with the re
[ main ing place sqjpewhat of a prob
lem. Buller, who has put in most
j of his playing on the hot corner of
the infield, was present in right field
i against Menlo, while Robinson shift -
j ed over to third and Pete Holmes
; filled in at second.
Coach Kingman of the Bears used
two of his moundsmen, O'Conner
and Horner, in losing to the St.
! Mary's yearlings last Tuesday, so he
jwill probably be compelled to send
MacManigal against the Indians to
morrow.
The complete Cardinal squad will
make the Berkeley trip, leaving
i from Encina gym at 9:30 o'clock Sat
, urday morning.
