## 
### 
It will be Stanford against the
field as play in the Northern Cali
fornia golf championship gets under
way at the Lake Merced Country
Club today.
Charles Seaver, Lawson Little,
Malcolm MacNaughton, Warner Ed
monds, Bob Goldwater, James Rea,
and Dink Templeton will all play in
the qualifying rounds of this tour
nament.
Judging from past performances,
v/hen the smoke of battle clears
away a week from next Sunday,
one of Stanford's representatives
will be sporting a new title.
Because of his fine showing in the
1930 national amateur tournament,
in which he gained the semi-finals,
Charles Seaver is the most highly
favored to turn the trick. He has
been devoting little time to golf
lately, but still was "hot" enough to
set a new record for the Stanford
course with a 69 in the recent Cali
fornia dual meet.

Sugar cane was first cultivated in
Ihe United Slates in the year 1751.
