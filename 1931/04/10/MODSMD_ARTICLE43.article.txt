Les "Abe" Hables is on crutches.
The crack Indian sprinter, who
i has been battling Hoc Dyer on at
least even terms in the sprints all
season, was kept out of practice
yesterday by a turned knee, and it
is doubtful if he will again be able
to don his spikes before the middle
.of next week.
Hables' injury may handicap him
in the California meet next Satur
| day, and mny even affect his run
j ning in the U.S.C. meet on May 2.
j While he is able to hobble about,
his physician has ordered him to
! use crutches for a few days at least
[to give the injury every chance to
' heal.
! Dink Templeton continued his pol
! icy of hard work in practice yes
terday, sending his charges through
a strenuous workout. If the Indians

| aren't in shape for the Golden Bear
: meet it won't be because of any
I lack of work, with Templeton plan
! ning not to taper off until the first
part of next week.
| Yesterday's session was not fea-
I tured by any sensational perform
ances, Virgil Dowell's leap of 23 feet
j 6 inches in the broadjump being one
! of the day's best.
J Jimmy Howell, injured last fall in
j a practice meet, when he pulled a
| muscle in his leg, ran his first quar
ter-mile since that time yesterday,
' reeling off the one lap alone in the
: fairly good time of 50.9 seconds. He
j should soon begin to round into
j good shape.
Frank Young, Olympic Club run
iner now attending Stanford, ran a
good half-mile in 1:56.9, Bob Brown
'trailing well behind in 1:58.1.
