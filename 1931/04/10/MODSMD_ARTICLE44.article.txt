# CUADRO DOWNS D.U. BALL NINE 13-12 IN INTRAMURAL GAME
## 
### 
In the only intramural baseball
game played yesterday El Cuadro
defeated the D.U.'s in a high scor
ing game 13 to 12 played on the
new intramural diamond.
The other scheduled game be
tween the Breakers and Phi Kappa
Sigma was postponed until later by
mutual consent. No games are slated
for tomorrow and play will be re
sumed next week.
As both games played so far were
by teams in League 11, the A.K.L.'s
and El Cuadro are in a tie for
league honors. Parker Reed, intra
mural manager, is anxious that all
teams report when their games are
supposed to be played in order that
the season will be completed as
quickly as possible.
Games are being played on the
old Sequoia field and the new intra
mural diamond located between the
Polo field and the Grays' gridron.
