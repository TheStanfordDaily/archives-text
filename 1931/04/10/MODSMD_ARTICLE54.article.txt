# EXHIBITION OF FINE PRINTING NOW ON DISPLAY IN LIBRARY
## 
### 
Opening today for a two weeks'
showing, "Fifty Books of the Year"'
and "Printing for Commerce," ex
hibits of the American Institute of
Graphic Arts, will be displayed in
the Stanford Library. They will be
in the eases of the Bender Collec
tion.
The books are selected annually
by the Institute as representing the
best of American printing for the
year. This year's exhibit is espe
cially interesting in showing recent
trends in bookmaking toward the
more traditional forms as opposed to
the excessive "modernism" of re
cent years. In "Fifty Books" sub
ject matter is not considered, the
hook being judged only according to
how well it fits its purpose.

The display is under the joint
auspices of the Stanford Library and
the Stanford University Press. It is
the first showing of this year's ex
hibit on the Pacific Coast.
