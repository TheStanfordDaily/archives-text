The San Francisco Seals won the opening Coast League baseball game from Portland, 8 to 0, before
one of the largest crowds in history. Ty Cobb, (right) one of the game's famous figures, missed the first
ball by two feet in the dedication of the new $1,250,000 stadium. Part of the crowd is shown with San
Francisco's skyline in background.
