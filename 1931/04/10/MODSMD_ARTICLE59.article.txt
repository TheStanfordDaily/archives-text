DERKELEY, April 10. (IP)—
Faculty members of the de
partment of paleontology, Uni
versity of California, are look
ing for a place to hide some
skeletons—big ones.
It seems the whale fossils,
weighing two and one-half tons,
have been white elephants ever
since they were given to the
university. one time they
were sent to the National Mu
seum, Washington, D.C., but
the museum officials didn't
want them, and shipped them
back to Berkeley.
At present they are standing
near the mailing division build
ing, while university officials
are looking for a space large
enough to store them.
It is not known whether the
big bones will be sent as a
friendly gesture to Stanford
University, neighboring insti
tution across the bay.
