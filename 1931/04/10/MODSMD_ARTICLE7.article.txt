# ‘500' APPEALING TO WATTS MAN AS GOOD WIVES
## 
### 
THE recent Daily editorial on
college-made marriages has
had apparent effect. And now
to those members of the "500"
who are to be sweet June
graduates, and who have stag
gered through four years in
the University without con
tracting matrimonial obliga
tions, the chance of a lifetime
has presented itself.
The Daily yesterday received
a letter written from Watts,
California, with an advertise
ment that the writer requested
be published in the classified
section. The advertisement was
worded as follows:
"Wanted — Correspondence
with a brunette, under 120
pounds, preferably a school
ma'am. Smoker not wanted. Am
widower of 48, some means.
Reply to box 29, Watts."
Warily precluding answers
from 2SOO romance-loving
roughs, the would-be bride
groom adds a request for: "All
particulars in first letter."
Watts is a well-known negro
colony of suburban Los An
geles.
