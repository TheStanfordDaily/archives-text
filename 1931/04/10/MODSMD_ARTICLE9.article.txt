# RECOVERY OF KING GEORGE DECLARED SLOW BUT CERTAIN
## 
### 
WINDSOR. England, April S </P). I
—King George is slowly but surely
—apparently—recovering from the
attack of sub-acute bronchitis from j
which he has been suffering several
days.
An official statement tonight said
that the King continues to make
slow but satisfactory progress. The
slight improvement made during the
past two days has been maintained, J
it was said, and the King is continu- j
ing to gain ground. I
Lord Dawson of Penn, the royal
physician, again motored from Lon
don today to see his patient and Sir
Nelson Rees, noted laryngologist,
and Henry Martyn, resident physi
cian at Windsor, also visited him.
Following their examination, it was
announced he was maintaining his
progress.
The insistence in well-informed t
circles that His Majesty's return to |
complete recovery likely will be
slow has naturally caused concern in
the public mind, but to some extent
this is offset by the knowledge that
the normal routine of the castle is
being carried out.
