# STANFORD NINE BEATS HORNER, TAKES SERIES
## Bears Scalped For First Time In Five Years; Horner Jinx Ends JOHNSON PITCHES WELL Victory Puts Stanford At Head Of League 
### Francis Lloyd 
The Horner jinx was broken and
now it is no more!
With the bases loaded, two outs,
and two strikes on the batter, Rin
tala lined Horner's next delivery into
deep center field, scoring two men
and clinching for Stanford the first
California series win in five years
which the Indians assured Saturday,
by defeating the Bears 9-1 in their

Hardy alone being responsible for

catch.
Surprising the most fanatic rooter,
Art Miller distinguished himself by
being the first Indian catcher this
season to throw a man out attempt
ing to steal second. An ability to
take advantage of every break and a
general alertness characterized the
entire Stanford team.
