# BRITAIN FACES DISCUSSION OF BUDGET CRISIS
## MacDonald Censured For Not Fulfilling Labor Party Election Pledges 
### 
LONDON, April 12 (ZP)â€”Parlia-
I ment will reassemble Tuesday under
[ the shadow of the budget and faced
! with new aspects of empire and con
j tinental problems.
Thursday there will be a debate
i on a motion censoring the regime of
. Ramsay Mac Donald for not carrying
1 out its election pledges. This carries
with it a threat to the life of the
] Labor government, but while defeat
| is always possible in view of inse
; cure Liberal support, such an end
I is not considered likely this week.
Mac Donald Back
Prime Minister Mac Donald is com
ing back from his holiday at Lossie
mouth in a fighting mood. He is
' expected to scrape through this ncw-
I est crisis by a narrow majority.
With King George undoubtedly
i recovering from his attack of bron
chitis and the atmosphere of anx
iety at Windsor Castle disappearing,
j and also with a breathing spell in
I Indian affairs, the Labor govern
j ment's chief concern at present is
in relation to the general European
situation.
Officials Optimistic
Downing street maintains its stud
i ied optimism in regard to untangling
i the hitch in drafting of the Anglo
; Franco-Italian naval agreement.
However, it is known Brtish officials
j close to this work are alarmed over
the probability of a real breakdown
i unless the French make concessions
when negotiations are resumed this
' week.

Another aspect of the continental
j situation is the proposed visit to
London of the German Chancellor
and Foreign Minister, scheduled for
June 5. This has caused some sus
picion in European capitals. How
ever, this visit probably will result
only in an exchange of viev/s on
j current continental problems.
