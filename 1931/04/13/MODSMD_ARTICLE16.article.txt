Written by Don Cameron and Paul
Lorton, this year's Junior Opera
deals with the amusing situations
into which Stephen Bryant, an
American business man, plunges
himself in dealing with the rival So
viet Russian factions.
The opening chorus for the first
scene, which is laid in the waiting
room of the great railway station in
Prolegrad, is "Russia," written by
Roger Sumner. A feature number
will be "Another Day," sung by Al
ice Cole and Stephen Bryant, parts
which are taken by Helen Sue Eye
ster and John Skinner. GrifT Wil
liams is the writer of this number.
"Introducing Us" and "For You
Alone," both by Bob Thornton, are
lyrics sung in the first act. The
"Loyalty Song" which is to be sung
by the Blue and White Spy Choruses
is the stirring song which finishes
Act I.
Act 11, laid in the manager's office
of the Elder Safety Razor Company,
opens with a number by GrifT Wil

! liams and Helen Sue Eyster. "Who
Said Depression" is one of the "catch
hits" of the opera. The "Mystery
I Song" is to be the musical feature
of the second scene in this act.
Several specialty acts will be in
| eluded in the last scene, in which the
stage settings show a completely
rigged theater within a theater. Jean
j Hay and Harrison Foss dance the
"Hopak," a Russian folk dance, Mil
j dred West, Josephine Wilson, and

sian gypsy dance, and Ruhland Isaly,
