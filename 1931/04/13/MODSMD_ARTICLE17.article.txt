# SPANISH EXULT AT OVERTHROW OF ROYALISTS
## Republican Victory Sweeps Major Cities; Abdication Of King Awaited 
### 
MADRID, April 12—(/Pi—Repub
| licans in at least two-thirds of the
| big cities of Spain today attained
sweeping majorities in the first mu
nicipal elections held in Spain dur
ing the eight years since the late
Primo de Rivera assumed the dic
tatorship.
The elections were marked by in-
I tense excitement and although there

; were street lights in many of the
cities the elections proceeded with
much less disorder than had been
anticipated and no major clashes
| were precipitated.

Voters in the major cities ap
peared to have repudiated the mon-
I archist candidates, returning Repub-
I lican councilmen by overwhelming
majorities in almost every instance.
| Although in the smaller provincial
! towns the monarchist candidates ap
peared to be holding their own, in
the provincial capitals the story was
| repeated with large majorities for
; the Republicans.
Among the most astonishing of
j their imposing list of victories was
j the Republican success in Guadala
j jara, represented by the Count of
{ Romanones, one of the strongest men
jin the Anzar cabinet. They were
i also victorious at San Sebastian and
! Arangue, where King Alphonso has
| residences.
They appeared to have won twen-
Sty-eight of the thirty contested seats
in the Madrid City Council, and
i similar returns came from Seville,
j Barcelona, Valencia, and Oviedo.
In Huesca and Jaca where the
: most serious fighting of last Decem
! ber's revolution occurred, the Re
! publicans made a clean At
i Cadiz, however, the monarchists won
| all of the council's seats. One, of the
Republican candidates at Valencia
was Sigrido Blasco-Ibanez, son of the
| famous novelist. He appeared to
have won.
Four million voters, it was esti
! mated, participated in the elections.
In May the voters will elect mem
j bers to the lower house of the na
j tional Legislature, and in June there
' is to be a senatorial election.

The throne itself is at stake in
these three elections, for the Repub
licans demand what their party
j name indicates. They stand for the
j abdication of King Alfonso and
! establishment of a full constitutional
j Republican government in Spain.

j Republican government in Spain.
MADRID, April 12—(/Pi—Repub
| licans in at least two-thirds of the
| big cities of Spain today attained
sweeping majorities in the first mu
nicipal elections held in Spain dur
ing the eight years since the late
Primo de Rivera assumed the dic
tatorship.
The elections were marked by in-
I tense excitement and although there

; were street lights in many of the
cities the elections proceeded with
much less disorder than had been
anticipated and no major clashes
| were precipitated.

Voters in the major cities ap
peared to have repudiated the mon-
I archist candidates, returning Repub-
I lican councilmen by overwhelming
majorities in almost every instance.
| Although in the smaller provincial
! towns the monarchist candidates ap
peared to be holding their own, in
the provincial capitals the story was
| repeated with large majorities for
; the Republicans.
Among the most astonishing of
j their imposing list of victories was
j the Republican success in Guadala
j jara, represented by the Count of
{ Romanones, one of the strongest men
jin the Anzar cabinet. They were
i also victorious at San Sebastian and
! Arangue, where King Alphonso has
| residences.
They appeared to have won twen-
Sty-eight of the thirty contested seats
in the Madrid City Council, and
i similar returns came from Seville,
j Barcelona, Valencia, and Oviedo.
In Huesca and Jaca where the
: most serious fighting of last Decem
! ber's revolution occurred, the Re
! publicans made a clean At
i Cadiz, however, the monarchists won
| all of the council's seats. One, of the
Republican candidates at Valencia
was Sigrido Blasco-Ibanez, son of the
| famous novelist. He appeared to
have won.
Four million voters, it was esti
! mated, participated in the elections.
In May the voters will elect mem
j bers to the lower house of the na
j tional Legislature, and in June there
' is to be a senatorial election.

The throne itself is at stake in
these three elections, for the Repub
licans demand what their party
j name indicates. They stand for the
j abdication of King Alfonso and
! establishment of a full constitutional
j Republican government in Spain.
