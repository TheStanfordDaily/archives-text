# GUIDES FOR ALUMNI DAY WANTED-PIKE
## 
### 
Guides to conduct alumni visitors
on University Day to the points of
interest on the campus are now
being drafted for duty, according to
Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president. The
Rally Committee and the Scalpers
Society, which have donated their
services, will not fill the quota, and
additional volunteers may sign up
any time in the A.S.S.U. office in the
Old Union.
