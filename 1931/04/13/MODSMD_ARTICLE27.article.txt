# RUSSIANS MOCK AT EASTER FESTIVITIES
## 
### 
MOSCOW, April 12
sands of persons crowded churches
for observance of Orthodox Easter
today, while young atheists sang
anti-religious songs and held mock
church services in the streets of the
city.
Those parading outside carried
banners inscribed "Down with Je
sus Christ" and "Long Live Lenin
ism." Old tramcars were fitted out
as altars and youthful atheists,
wearing exaggerated priestly gar
ments, carried on mock services as
the cars moved through the princi
pal streets of Moscow.
