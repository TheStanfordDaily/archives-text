# JUST TOW MORE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
Today's Campus Opinion column contains a defense of
llie junior colleges by Don Nugent, His letter was oc
casioned hv The Daily's publication of figures showing that
the tirst-year scholastic performances of junior college stu
dents admitted to the I'llivorsity during 192U HO were lower
than corresponding performances of high school students
admitted during'lhe same period.
Mr. Nugent maintains that the average grade-point rat
ing of the junior college students, if considered for the past
nine years, would prove to be higher than that of the group
of students who came here direct from high schools and
preparatory schools. However, he raises the point that if
the high school entrant is achieving a higher scholastic
average than the junior college entrant, that is something
to be expected, since Ihe former are far more carefully
selected than the latter.
If this is the case, and undoubtedly il is, a partial expla
nation is offered for the poorer showing of the junior col
lege students admitted during 1!)2{)-.'M>. Hut the explanation
raises the question why should the I'nivcrsity, tor the
sake of strengthening the position of the junior colleges,
admit transfers from such institutions on a different and
far less selective basis than applicants from high schools?
Why should the I niversity impair the scholastic quality
of its owii student body in order to encourage the junior
colleges?
The junior college may indeed be an established part
of our educational system, as Nugent declares, but it has
not yet proven itself an adecpiate substitute for the first two
years of university work. Too much may have been ex
pected of the junior college, but the fact remains that il has
not yet shown itself to be other than just two more years
of high school.
