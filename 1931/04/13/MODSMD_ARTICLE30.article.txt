# ANOTHER OF THE "OLD GUARD" IS GONE
## 
### 
Death lasl week look another of the "Old Guard" of
faculty leaders who struggled under Dr. Jordan in tlie early
years of the University's history to make of Stanford the
institution il is today. Dr. Stewart W. Young, professor of
physical chemistry, and since 185)3 a member of the faculty,
passed away in the Palo Alto Hospital.
Long known as an able teacher and a distinguished sci
entist, Dr. Young was the lasl of that famous four who first
gave Stanford's Department of Chemistry its reputation for
excellence. Dr. John M. Stillman, Dr. George M. Richard
son, and Dr. John L. Lennox have all died during the past
few years, and now Dr. Young, the fourth and lasl of the
department's "Old Guard," lias joined them.
His passing leaves a gap that will not be easy to fill, and
he will long be remembered as one of the pioneers who
toiled and fought when Stanford was in its infancy, and
lived to see il as il is todav.
