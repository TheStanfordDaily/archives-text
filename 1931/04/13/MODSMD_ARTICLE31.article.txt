Daniel W'illard. president of the Raltimore & Ohio rail-J
road, in a recent interview said: "I can think of nothing j
more deplorable than the condition of a man able and
anxious to work, but unable to secure work. . . . While I
do not like to say so ... 1 would steal before I would

Indeed, as Sir Thomas More asked, "what can they then
els doo but steale"? And yet, instead of intelligently facing
this problem, many mayors Yind police officers feel Ihev are
doing their duty when Ihev arrest hundreds of men as va
grants, simply because those men are out of work. Relief
for the many thousands of unemployed will never come
from municipal officials who pursue the short-sighted
course of trying lo punish unemployment.

Daniel W'illard. president of the Raltimore & Ohio rail-J
road, in a recent interview said: "I can think of nothing j
more deplorable than the condition of a man able and
anxious to work, but unable to secure work. . . . While I
do not like to say so ... 1 would steal before I would
starve."
Indeed, as Sir Thomas More asked, "what can they then
els doo but steale"? And yet, instead of intelligently facing
this problem, many mayors Yind police officers feel Ihev are
doing their duty when Ihev arrest hundreds of men as va
grants, simply because those men are out of work. Relief
for the many thousands of unemployed will never come
from municipal officials who pursue the short-sighted
course of trying lo punish unemployment.
