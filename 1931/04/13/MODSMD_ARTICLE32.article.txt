# BULL SESSION
## AMERICA NOT THE ONLY LAND OF APPLESAUCE 
### 
There are two classes of people
in these United States—those who
think this nation is the biggest and
best in everything, and those who
believe anything from Europe is
superior to the native product —
whether it be perfume, politicians,
or poodles.
Now, it must be stated at the cut
set that we are not members of the
United States Chamber of Com
merce, the Rotary Club, or even the
Better American Federation. Yet we
do believe that those people claim
ing membership in the intellectual
upper-crust, who take persistent and
sophisticated delight in calling men
in our public life cheap politicians,
narrow provincials, and less print
able things, should pause a moment
to indulge in a few impartial
glances at fair Europa, their ideal.
It is true that America has its
share (perhaps too large a share)
of Heflins and Brookharts. It may
be true that the average intelligence
in the United States is 14 years and
that Congress doesn't aid the aver
age. It may be true that our Presi
dents kiss babies, our governors are
elected by milking cows before
waiting cameras; and our mayors
get calloused palms from handing
"keys to the city" to everybody from
airplane stowaways to worn-out
opera stars. While all this may be
true, it does not give Europe a
clean bill of health to claim that ali
her politicians are statesmen —in-
telligent, calm, and sagacious, ap
pealing solely to the intelligence of
a people who carefully weight poli
tical matters and then vote for the
best candidates.
Many examples from current his
tory might be cited to show that

; politics, in the crude sense of the
word, plays its part over as j
i much as it does over here. Probably
• no better example could be found j
than a recent speech by Joseph
Stalin (reprinted in April's "Living i
1 Age").
! In this address, the "Iron Man of ;
Russia," shows that he is well sup
plied with good old-fashioned Mid- !
dlewestern applesauce. His principal ;
I thesis is telling the Party how good j
they have been in the past; how i
J powerful they are at the present; j
|and what wonderful things Uiey will
do in the future. His theme is a j
perfect* steal from the recent Ameri- I
i can billboard campaign, "Forward
I America, Nothing Can Stop U.S."
Stalin is vociferously confident that
! "Nothing can stop the U.S.S.R." His
! prize sentence is to the effect that
Ihe will tell the truth like a "good
I Bolshevik."
j If one were to change his speech,
: omitting a few words like world
j revolution, communist, proletariat, it
would sound very much like the
I average "key-note speech" at a Re
] publican or Democratic convention
1 —full of talk about party loyalty,
■ prosperity, no unemployment, and
; national greatness. If Rotary ever
; | ventures into this land which is sup
l | plying the theme for this year's
L I Junior Opera, we nominate Dictator
■ ! Stalin as head after-luncheon speak
i ! er.
i i The statement that in Europe, the
• | cream of the populace goes into
• j politics, while in America this class
I "plays polo and the stock market,"
■ 1 is partly true; but it is likewise un
; ; deniable that American methods are
j rapidly being introduced into Euro
• I pean politics as well as business.
