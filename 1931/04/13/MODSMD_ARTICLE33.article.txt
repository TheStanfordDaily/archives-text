## ACCEPT THE JUNIOR COLLEGE AS A "FAIT ACCOMPLI" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The news and editorial columns of
(he April 6 issue of The Daily car
ried figures quoted from the recent
ly published Registrar's report,
showing a comparison in scholastic
achievement unfavorable to junior
college transfers. The figures are in
deed true, but they do not picture
the whole situation.
In the first place, it is not entirely
fair to quote the figures for one in
dividual year as indicative of a pre
vailing situation or a trend toward
a situation. Had the Registrar's re
ports for the past 10 years been
quoted, the impression conveyed
; would have been quite different; in
j fact it would have shown that the
1 present situation seems to be merely
j a fluctuation in the general average
i over a 10-year period—something
that has occurred before and will
undoubtedly occur again. It would
| show that the general average for
i the past nine years (the only years
| for which figures are available) is
! 1.479, while the average for entrants
from high schools is 1.466.
•But assuming for the sake of
i argument that the "native" student
: is achieving a higher grade point
| rating than is the junior college
i transfer—is this not to be expected?
I The group entering from high school
has been markedly limited in the
past 10 years (from 800 in 1920 to
! 503 in 1930, a reduction of almost
j 40%) though there has been no such
decrease in the number of appli
cants, with a group so limited it is
obvious that a stricter selection oi'
candidates takes place—that only
those with exceedingly high scholas
tic achievement will be admitted.
Surely a high quality of university
work should be expected from such
a highly selected group.
On the other hand, junior college
transfers (men) have been admitted
almost without restriction—those
: having attained a "C" average in
junior college being admitted. In
! such a roughly selected group there
1 would of course be weaker students
who would pull down the average
of the group. Further, the number
i of junior college transfers has in
i creased markedly in the last 10 years

I (from 36 in 1920 to 223 in 1930, an
I increase of 500%)- Again, in the
i number of junior colleges sending
transfers to Stanford has increased
! from 16 in 1921 to 48 in 1930, an
increase of 300%. Is it not to be
expected that as the transfer group
so rapidly increases, and with the
I very light scholarship requirement
I remaining constant at a "C" average,
j that the scholarship average for the
group will decline? In other words,
! while there has been a more and
more rigorous selection of high
school graduates, the number of
junior-college entrants has tremen
j dously increased, selection becoming
! less and less rigorous.
i It will be of interest to note, how
ever, that the situation in regard to
; junior college transfers is likely to
; be greatly improved during the cur
| rent year. A system of "differentia
! tion" has been worked out, which
: will evaluate grades awarded by
; various individual junior colleges on
I the basis of past achievement of its
graduates at Stanford. This in itself
is a sysiem of selection, and it is not
| unreasonable to assume that by next
I year the comparison will again favor
j junior college transfers. This sys
| tem of differentiation is not a unique
j one; something of the same general
j type of thing has been done for
years in evaluating units from other
i four-year institutions. It is a com
monly accepted fact that all colleges
| are not equally strong, and no one
i would hold for a moment that all
j junior colleges are worthy of the
i j same type of recognition. The new
differentiation system will soon weed
[ out the weaker institutions by pen
! alizing the grades presented by their
! graduates.
While The Daily undoubtedly has
a right to its opinion of junior col-
I leges, it is well to note that this
j comparatively new institution has
j already become so firmly established
in the educational system of the
I country that neither ridicule nor
| condemnation will greatly affect it.
I It would seem that it would be a
j far happier policy to accept the
I situation as a "fait accompli," and
i adjust our viewpoints accordingly.
Very respectfully,
Don Nugent, '23
