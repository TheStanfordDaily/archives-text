A CONNECTICUT YANKEE—At i
the Varsity Theatre.
By popular demand, "A Connecti-
J cut Yankee" came back to Palo Alto I
i yesterday to spend three more days \
amusing the people.
Will Rogers as a Yankee probably
] makes a better movie than even !
Mark Twain would have imagined, j
j The additions of modern contri- j
j vances, the presence of gorgeous
I scenery, the acting of Maureen ,
| O'Sullivan and Myrna Loy enhance i
i vague memories of the silent pro
i duction, which • appeared several
I years ago, until it seems to be an !
I entirely new and unusually suc
! cessful movie.

ABOVE THE DARK TUMULT—By
Hugh Walpole. Doubleday, Doran.
New York, 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Walpole has had a "vacation,"
i similar to the one which produced
"The Man With Red Hair." In his
dedicatory note he expresses the
hope that no one will take him seri
! ously. Ho is writing for what he be

lieves to be the first purpose of 1
literature —entertainment.
Dick Gunn was present at all but .
one of the series of affairs which
took him from desperate hunger, '
through murder, blackmail, suicide j
of the murderer who rids London of j
the villainous Pengelly brothers.
And in the midst of it all, Dick finds
love and prosperity.
"Above The Dark Tumult," writ
ten in the always readable style
that is Walpole's greatest charm,
suggests a little Farnol's romance. I
It might almost be colled a Farnol
novel grown up, and as such it is
an excellent tale. —J.N.
HONOR AMONG LOVERS—At ilic
New Stanford Theatre.
"Honor Among Lovers" is a mis
leading title for an unusually amus
ing show. The dialogue is snappy
and shows sophistication-plus and
very rarely drags.
Claudette Colbert is as fascinat
ing as ever as the able but beautiful
private secretary to the man-of-the- |
world business man played by |

; Frederic March. His philosophy of
i love and its conduct is expressed in
the single remark, "I come from a
long line of bachelors." He so far
! forgets himself as to offer his
i tary marriage and when he finds
that she has already plunged with
' his rival he goes on loving in the
. time-honored way of unrequited
lovers. He pays and pays without
receiving anything in a way that
' only Hollywood would believe in its
more sentimental moments. But
i Hollywood never fails the gullible
public—he gets the goil in the end.
Despite that, however, it is worth
seeing if only for the dialogue and
the ultra modern furnishing of the
sets, and the liquor haloed remarks
j of Ginger Rogers. —S.C.A.
