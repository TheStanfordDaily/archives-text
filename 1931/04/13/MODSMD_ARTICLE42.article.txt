### POOR CAL 
Gather 'round, mates, and shod a
tear lor our brethren across the bay.
For alas, that ferocious, mighty
Golden Boar of long ago is become
anemic from lack of nourishment.
Through his once-glossy blue and
gold hide you can count his ribs.
What a pitiful sight to see the poor
follow beaten and kicked about here
on the Farm by a tribe of nine In
dians, who for five long years had
remained a delicious morsel, stable
in the otherwise diminishing diet of
the bloodthirsty animal.

Yet that is but one of the
many depp and painful wounds
inflicted upon various portions
of his sporting •anatomy by
sundry foes during the past
week-end. Today the Bear is
cowering in his lair, nursing
damage done by the tomahawk
in swimming and water polo,
freshman tennis and track, as
well as in baseball. An angry
Husky from the North swamped
three Bears crews; the Trojans
in the South annihilated Cali
fornia's "best" oval team in years
by even more than the antici
pated landslide of points. We re
peat, poor Cal!
This year of our Lord 1931 finds
the punch-drunk veteran, once a
glorious, clawing, invincible crea
ture, leaning heavily on his one re
maining crutch, the hoop title of
California. Even in this, Redshirts
are threatening. The monotonous
string of Blue and Gold victories in
the court game, extending from way
back in '25, was broken last winter.
Then Price's men won the Southern
half crown, but failed in the North
against U. of W. for the first time
in a blue moon!
Who that witnessed Saturday's
hall game could refuse to join in
this mournful chorus of heart
felt weeping? California, ever
victorious in the Great American
Pastime, plastered by a !)-l score
to make it a pair and the first
Big Red series since 1925! Ernie
Nevers was the dynamo of that
series, pitching ail three games
and knocking home runs in each
of the last two tilts. In the de
ciding contest his four-bag blow
happened when the bases were
loaded, to drive in four runs and
victory.

Stanford's new ball park was ihe
scene of drama Saturday, a drama
of a couple of young pitchers. For
Norman Horner, Axeless custodian,
it was tragedy. On six successive
occasions he had thwarted hopes of
Indian sluggers, by scores of 7-2,
4-2, 9-S, 7-6, 3-2, and 6-3. He had
dropped one the v/eek previous, 3-2,
but still had a chance to save this,
his last series for his alma mater.
He pitched good ball, but the breaks
were against him, his support crum
bled, and he left the mound after
ihe disastrous six-run seventh in
ning.

Dan Johnson, pitching his first
Cal scries, bids fair to exceed
Horner's record of six straight
Big Series wins. In his first two
games against the Indian team
of 1!(29. Horner began his bril
liant career by allowing only
nine hits in the brace of tilts.
Dan lias let the Bears off with
13 so far.

More than just a stellar hurler,
Johnson is an inspiration to the
earn. When he is in the box the
Doyi ploy air-tight ball, and back it
ip with plenty of hits; when he is
>n the bench they slump. Saturday
hey gathered 13 safe bingies and
vere charged with only two errors,
iut pitchers alone can't win ball
(ames. The entire Indian club, from
Toac-h Wolter to the bat boy, dc
erv.es a big hand for the triumph,
ind plenty of support from the fans.
It's ail right for the paid cus
tomers to boo the umpires and
crack all the peanuts they want,
but cracking firecrackers is an
other matter. Whether or not the
loud explosions of those Fourth
of-July cigars thrown onto the
field while Horner was hurling
bothered the visitor, they showed
somebody lacking in sportsman*-
ship and the true spirit of a
Stanford host. —Crawford.
