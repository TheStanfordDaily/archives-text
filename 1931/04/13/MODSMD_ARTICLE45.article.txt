# BEAR'S UNEXPLAINED WEAKNESS. NOT NEW TROJAN STRENGTH, DEBACLE CAUSE
## 
### Stewart Crawford 
! No doubt Dink Templeton got an
eyeful of Trojans in the South Sat
urday, but instead of thinking "What
■ will they do to us?" he is probably
! wondering "What was the matter
with California?"
Touted as the best Bear team in
several years, Christie's men headed
South potentially capable of making
the meet fairly interesting.
Poole Off Form
Poole's performance in the pole
J vault is but one example of how
j badly the Blue and Gold athletes
failed to come near their best previ-
I ous marks of the season. Poole, who
! has done 13 feet 9 1; j inches, could
do no better than a tie for second at
| 12 feet 6 inches, while his team
! mate, Vantress, fell more than a foot
| short of his best vault of 13 feet and
I consequently did not place.
' The Trojans showed no surprise
j strength, unless it was in the relay,
| where a boy named Earl Calahan
j placed second ahead of Learned,
formerly -doped as Troy's second
j best miler.
Calahan was reported to have in-

I fluenza, which would keep him out
1 of the meet on May 2. It looks now
: as though his illness will have sub
j sided considerably in a month, when
■ lie will probably enter the two-mile
against the Indians. He is said to be
■ a 9:50 runner, which means that he
land Unruh of the Trojans can shut
J out Johnny Parker to annex 4 points
: in this event.
That Vic Williams, Cromwell's
only hope to break into the East
| man-Hables combination in the 440,
is rounding into shape is evidenced
by his time of 43.4. This is the first
time he has runt that fast this sea
; son, though ho was consistent under
| 49 last year.
Hall Below Par
Troy's weight man, Hall, is still
short of a mark capable of placing
in either the shot or the discus on
May 2, though he was not pressed
Saturday in either event.
That Frank Wykoff is going to be
' consistent this season in the 220 at
close to 21.2 was indicated when he
| stopped the watches at that figure
i for the second time this year.

Hall Below Par

! No doubt Dink Templeton got an

urday, but instead of thinking "What

Touted as the best Bear team in

the meet fairly interesting.
Poole Off Form
Poole's performance in the pole
J vault is but one example of how
j badly the Blue and Gold athletes
failed to come near their best previ-
I ous marks of the season. Poole, who
! has done 13 feet 9 1; j inches, could
do no better than a tie for second at
| 12 feet 6 inches, while his team
! mate, Vantress, fell more than a foot
| short of his best vault of 13 feet and
I consequently did not place.
' The Trojans showed no surprise
j strength, unless it was in the relay,

j placed second ahead of Learned,
formerly -doped as Troy's second
j best miler.
Calahan was reported to have in-

I fluenza, which would keep him out
1 of the meet on May 2. It looks now
: as though his illness will have sub
j sided considerably in a month, when
■ lie will probably enter the two-mile
against the Indians. He is said to be
■ a 9:50 runner, which means that he
