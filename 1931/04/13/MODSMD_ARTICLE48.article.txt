# HILLMAN PLACED AT FULLBACK POSITION IN FIRST SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
Ending the first two weeks of
| spring practice, Coach Pop Warner
sent the football squad through the
fi,rst scrimmage of the season Friday
' afternoon.
As might" be expected, the session
was marked by rather crude and
sloppy play. The most significant
feature of the day was that Warner
had Captain Harry Hillman work
ing almost entirely at the fullback
rather than his accustomed quarter
back position, with Phil Baker
working at quarter.
"Dusty" Allen, regardecLas an
: other prospect for the back posi
tion, left vacant by Harlow Rothert
and Bill Simkins, was at fullback
; on the "second'' team.
This may not indicate anything in
i particular, however, as Caddel and
Rintala are still occupied with base
i ball, and Warner might switch either
{from halfback to fullback berths.
