# INDIAN GOLFERS GAIN VICTORIES
## Seaver, Little Advance In District Tourney 
### 
Three freshman members of Stan
ford's crack golf brigade, Charles
: Seaver, Lawson Little, and Jerry
Trautman, were still in the running
j for the Northern California amateur
i championship after completion of
first- and second-round match play
battles yesterday afternoon at the
Lake Merced Country Club.
Three others, Bob Goldwater,
Richie Hoag, and "Dink" Templeton
\ succeeded in making the qualifying
grade for the first flight but fell in
the first or second rounds.
Wind a Handicap
Malcolm MacNaughton and War
ner Edmonds, two other Indians in
i quest of the title, were literally
blown out of the tournament during
the qualifying round last Saturday.
A terrific wind which made low
scoring impossible, coupled with the
fact that many entrants had played
| their qualifying round on Friday,
1 when it was calm, formed too great
an obstacle for these two to sur
| mount.
Seaver Wins
Charles Seaver, most famous of
the Stanford brigade, had an easy
| time winning his 18-hole matches.
He defeated Dr. C. H. Pearce, 9 and
8, and H. F. Dale, 5 and 4, to reach
| his present position. Incidentally
j Seaver turned in the lowest Satur
j day score, 76, in qualifying.
Lawson Little came near suffering
the same fate as MacNaughton in the
, qualifying round. His 81 forced him
Ito engage in a play-off with five
' others for first flight places. After
coming through this hazard, he beat
; E. M. Eddy, 2 and 1, and Louis Feri,
1 up to reach the third round,
i Bob Goldwater upset one of the
! pre-tournament favorites, George
! Studinger, for a first-round victory.
