# JINX STRIKES AS DEATH DEPLETES R.O.T.C. STABLES
## 
### 
Dame Fortune seems to be hand
ing the local R.O.T.C. stables a
pretty rough deal these days, judg
ing from the conditions of about
half a dozen of their horsesâ€”two
dead and three or four soon to be
shot.
Conner, evidently somewhat of an
April fool, was found dead in his
stall on the morning of April 1. It
seems that the luckless animal be
came entangled in his halter-rope
during the night, tripped, and fell
in a fatal position.
With the unfortunate demise of
Stockings, one of the better mounts
of the unit, Saturday, this quarter's
list of deceased rises to two. It was
necessary to shoot Stockings after
his cinch had broken out on the
Page Mill road, driving him into a
frenzy duiing which he fatally in
jured himself by leaping through
barbed wire fences.
And now three or four horses,
permanently lamed, await orders
from the East for their execution.
One of these is Collector, known as
"the killer" ever since Allan Good
speed met death while using him
as a polo mount in the fall of 1929.
