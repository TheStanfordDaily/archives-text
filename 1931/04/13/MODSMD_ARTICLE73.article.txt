# BUGGE SCORES HIT AS VIOLINIST WITH MACMANUS GROUP
## String Ensemble Imitates Symphony At Memorial Church Recital 
### 
Before a small but appreciative
audience the Marguerite MacManus
String Ensemble, accompanied by
Warren D. Allen at the organ, gave
a delightful hour of music yesterday
afternoon in the Memorial Church.

"Mrs. MacManus has made a real
achievement in training this group
of players, which includes in its
members only two professionals,"
said Warren D. Allen in speaking of
the performance.

Outstanding on the program was
Elwyn Bugge's interpretation of the
violin solo in the first number, "Con
certo in A Minor" by Vivaldi-Na
chez. This selection showed feeling
and depth and revealed a true un
derstanding of music by the mu
sician.
The Mendelssohn selection, "Oc
tette in E Flat," was given with a
fine intonation by the ensemble. The
octette has been so well orchestrated
that it gives, without wood-winds,
the effect of a little symphony.
The personnel follows:
Violins—Elizabeth Perice, princi
pal; M. Arnold, E. Bugge, J. Ferns,
W. Gielow, F. Mannon, L. Posey, N.
Sears, M. Schwartz, E. Smith, F.
Vincent.
Violas—Lucelia Bates, principal;
E. Dixon, J. Charnow, W. Letroadec.
Violoncellos — Norma Letroadec,
principal; A. Camp.
