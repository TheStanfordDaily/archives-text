# SWAIN PAYS TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR YOUNG; FUNERAL WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
The passing of Dr. Stewart W.
Young, Stanford pioneer, brought
forth a statement of tribute from
Acting-President Robert E. Swain
last night.
"My acquaintance with Professor
Young goes back to my freshman
year at Stanford wh&n in the au
tumn of '94 entered his class in
elementary chemistry.
"He was the youngest member of
the department faculty here. From
the beginning he was recognized
both by the faculty and students as
a young man of unusual brilliancy
of mind and of scholarly interests
not only in chemistry, but music,
art, and literature. 1 have rarely
known anyone with interests so
wide, whose knowledge was so
sound.
"His passing takes from the de
partment the last of the 'old guard,'
and one for whom every student
came to have the greatest admira
tion and affection."
