# ALFONSO REIGN MAY COLLAPSE AS WAR LOOMS
## Spanish Rule In Danger As Republicans Demand King’s Abdication CABINET MAY RESIGN Madrid Rumors Claim End Of Dynasty Imminent 
### 
MADRID. April 13. (/P) —
Count de Ramanoes, Minister of
State, announced tonight that
(he entire Spanish Cabinet will
resign tomorrow morning and
that Juan de la Cierva, present
Minister of Public Works, will
attempt to form a new Conserv
ative-Monarchist Cabinet.
MADRID, April 13. (/P)~For four
hours tonight Premier Aznar's Cabi
net debated the advisability of re
signing in the face of yesterday s
Republican election victory but de
cided to postpone any announcement
until after a conference with King
Alfonso tomorrow.
Abdication Rumored
Should the King indicate he be
lieves the resignation of the cabinet
would be desirable, the resignation
would be forthcoming.
The Premier himself denied to
night that Alfonso would abdicate,
but rumors persisted that the end
of the monarchy was at hand. Armed
demonstrations in the streets con
firmed the Republicans' threats of
force. The King, however, has
shown a great flair for meeting
crises threatening his throne.
Republican leaders defied King
Alfonso late today by issuing an
ultimatum in which they bluntly
demanded an immediate establish
ment of a republic and broadly
threatened to establish one by force
if their desires were not granted.
King's Plans Mystery
Officials seemed bewildered and
some of the King's closest advisors
frankly confessed they did not know
what should be done. Socialist La
bor headquarters akeady has pre
pared blanket orders for a foreign
strike throughout Spain to be made
immediately if another dictatoi'ship
is attempted or if the King refuses
Alcala Zamora's ultimatum for im
mediate recognition of a Spanish re
public. It would mean the cessation
)f all industry, transportation, and
public utilities in the nation until
he monarch yielded.
Monarchists Divided
Heretofore the government has
jeen able in an emergency to count
m a military dictatorship, but today
vould apparently throw the country
nto virtual civil war.
In addition, the army and the
•hurch, formerly the strongest sup
ports of the monarchy, are both di
vided at present. The Republicans
von the city of Toledo, the heart of
Spanish Catholicism.
Any course the King follows was
>elieved to mean sooner or later the
nd of his dynasty.

that Juan de la Cierva, present
Minister of Public Works, will
attempt to form a new Conserv
ative-Monarchist Cabinet.
MADRID, April 13. (/P)~For four
hours tonight Premier Aznar's Cabi
net debated the advisability of re
signing in the face of yesterday s
Republican election victory but de
cided to postpone any announcement
until after a conference with King
Alfonso tomorrow.
Abdication Rumored
Should the King indicate he be
lieves the resignation of the cabinet
would be desirable, the resignation
would be forthcoming.
The Premier himself denied to
night that Alfonso would abdicate,
but rumors persisted that the end
of the monarchy was at hand. Armed
demonstrations in the streets con
firmed the Republicans' threats of
force. The King, however, has
shown a great flair for meeting
crises threatening his throne.
Republican leaders defied King
Alfonso late today by issuing an
ultimatum in which they bluntly
demanded an immediate establish
ment of a republic and broadly
threatened to establish one by force
if their desires were not granted.
King's Plans Mystery
Officials seemed bewildered and
some of the King's closest advisors
frankly confessed they did not know
what should be done. Socialist La
bor headquarters akeady has pre
pared blanket orders for a foreign
strike throughout Spain to be made
immediately if another dictatoi'ship
is attempted or if the King refuses
Alcala Zamora's ultimatum for im
mediate recognition of a Spanish re
public. It would mean the cessation
)f all industry, transportation, and
public utilities in the nation until
he monarch yielded.
Monarchists Divided
Heretofore the government has
jeen able in an emergency to count
m a military dictatorship, but today
vould apparently throw the country
nto virtual civil war.
In addition, the army and the
•hurch, formerly the strongest sup
ports of the monarchy, are both di
vided at present. The Republicans
von the city of Toledo, the heart of
Spanish Catholicism.
Any course the King follows was
>elieved to mean sooner or later the
nd of his dynasty.
