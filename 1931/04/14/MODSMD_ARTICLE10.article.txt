# LABOR PARTY REIGN HINGES ON LIBERALS
## New Vote Of Censure Seen As Menace To Life Of MacDonald Regime 
### 
LONDON, A pail 13. (A I )— With the
| brief respite afforded by tfcie Easter
Parliamentary adjournment over,
j Great Britain stands tonight on the
J eve of renewed political turmoil.
A conservative vote of censure
against the Mac Donald government
will be moved in the House of Com
mons on Thursday by former Prime
Minister Baldwin. The charge will
j be that the government has "failed
to carry out its election pledges re
i garding unemployment and has
| ceased even to attempt any reme
i dial measures." A defeat on the
' motion would mean immediate
resignation of the Mac Donald gov
i ernment and a consequent general
I election.
The key to the situation rests in
| Ihe hands of the Liberals. They
have decided to wait until they hear
I the government's defense enuring
Thursday's debate before deciding
which way they will vote. A pre
-1 liminary Liberal Party meeting is to
! be held Wednesday at which mem
-1 bers of the party will report the
attitudes of their constituencies.
Some Liberals are sure to vote
j against the government. If the bulk
jof the remainder should abstain
j from voting the result of the divi
| sion would be very close.
The majority of commentators are
agreed the last thing that would
further the Liberal Party's interests
would be a general electiotn at the
present time. This, with the confu
; sion that would be caused by a Par
liamentary dissolution on the eve of
the budget vote, is regarded as like-
Ily to save the government once
j again.
| Nevertheless, there is anticipated
1 a series of attacks following the
budget vote, on any of which the
government might go down.
