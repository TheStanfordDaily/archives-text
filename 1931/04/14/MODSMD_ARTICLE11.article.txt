# FEDERAL TRIBUNAL QUASHES GASOLINE ANTI-TRUST CLAIMS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Apr. 13 (/P).â€”The
Supreme Court today disposed of
44 of 72 cases which piled up dur
ing a three weeks' recess. The re
mainder, including the attack by
Arizona on construction of Hoover
Dam, went over until next Monday.
Among the more important deci
sions today was a ruling holding
valid the contracts among four large
oil companies by which they li
censed the use of patents for mak
ing gasoline by the cracking process.
The government had attacked
contracts between the Standard Oil
Company of Indiana, the Standard
Oil Company of New Jersey, the
Texas Company, and the Gasoline
Products Company, Inc., as viola
tions of the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act, and had asked an injunction.
The court also held that states
cannot impose graduated privilege
taxes on interstate bus companies
except, where the tax is clearly com
pensation for the vise of the high
way and that land submerged in
connection with hydro-electric pow
er development may be taxed by a
state.
