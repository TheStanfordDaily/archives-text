# ALUMNI DAY HAS CAMPUS DANCE BAND
## Thompson Music To Draw Student Support For Evening Festivity 
### 
Making a determined effort to at
tract students to the alumni dinner
and all-University dance to follow,
climaxing events on Saturday's Uni
versity Day program, the alumni
committee has enlisted the services
of Joe Thompson's five-piece band
for the occasion.
Thompson's music has been fea
tured at numerous campus functions
and is expected to be a drawing card
for student attendance. Alumni. Sec
retary John E. McDowell has issued
a blanket invitation to all under
graduates to come to all the events
listed for the day, and is counting on
the dinner and dance, to be held in
the women's gym, to bring students
and alumni together in the largest
numbers.
Reservations Asked
Reservations for the dinner, at
$1.50 per plate, and for the midday
barbecue, at $1 per person, must be
in McDowell's office by Thursday
noon. Attendance at the dance, at
9 ocloek, after the dinner, will be
at $1 per couple and no advance
x'eservations will be required.
Tables for the dinner will be ar
ranged in the arcades of the new
gym, the plan having the advantages
at once of a picturesque setting and
leaving room for the entertainment
to be offered during dinner. The
show will be composed of student
talent but has not yet been definitely
completed.
For the benefit of non-dancing
alumni or students, if any, card
tables will be set up in anterooms
and corners.
Students t oAssist
Several student organizations have
expressed their willingness to co
operate with the alumni executive
committees on the day's program.
Cap and Gown, women's senior hon
or society, will have charge of the
registration in the big book of re
turning alumni, to be located in the
Administration Building.
The Rally Committee and Scalpers
Society will be the chief student
guides for the morning campus
tours. Since these tours are planned
to take in all new improvements on
the campus, as well as special tech
nical exhibitions, the two organi
zations will not complete the roster
of the guide positions that will need
filling.
Tom Pike, A.S.S.U. president, has
therefore renewed his # announce
ment of last week that men and
women who are interested in show
ing the graduate visitors around on
Saturday morning are requested to
sign up at the A.S.S.U. office in the
Old Union any time this week.
