### Rolph Malloch 
The Russians are the Puritans of
1931, according to Major W. S. Over- i
1 ton, who spoke yesterday afternoon '
at the meeting of the Faculty Wom
en's Club in the Little Theatre.
Major Overton, a West Point grad-
I uate, and now retired, made an ex
j tensive tour of the Soviet Union j
i last year. He accompanied his en- |
lightening speech before the club
I with motion pictures, which he him- J
j self took, of the new Russia.
Russians Are Sober
"I saw only two intoxicated per- â– 
I sons in all Russia," he said, and one ,
; of those is a Stanford graduate. The
! people are serious, hard-working,
! and fanatical believers in Commu-
J nism. Their ideal is the worker.
"When I was in Russia in 1905, the
i country was in a hopeless condi
tion. 1 saw the situation then, which
j makes me tolerant toward things as |
J they are now," Major Overton as- J
sorted. He expressed the opinion
that there is much to be said in
favor of the present system of gov
ernment in Russia, but added that j
I the individual is stifled, and that I

: discipline is carried to the point of
I tyranny.
Workers Respected
"Befoi-e the revolution, the peas
-1 ants of this country cringed and
j fawned in fear of the upper classes,"
! pointed out the returned traveler,
i "but today the working class in
! Russia is the highest class that is
| respected. The average Russian
j looks down upon the hated bour-
S geoisie, which is to say any person
who employs other people."
Major Overton said that Lenin had
i attempted to suppress religion by
force at first, but that that plan had
been abandoned in favor of educat
ing the people to see that it was the
i church which had held them down
' for so many centuries.
The speaker indicated that the
tight against liquor is being carried
j on by the same method of gradually
i educating the people to better ways,
; and that this system has resulted in
temperance. He said that America
is looked upon by the Russians as a
perfect example of all the vices run
I rampant.
