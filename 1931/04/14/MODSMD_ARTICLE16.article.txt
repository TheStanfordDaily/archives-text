Student Authors
The opera, which is lo be given
Friday night in the Assembly Hall,
was written by Don Cameron and
Paul Lorton. Music and lyrics have,
for the most part, been written by
student talent, although Griff Wil
liams wrote two feature numbers,
"Another Day," and, assisted by
Helen Sue Eyster, "Who Said De
pression."
Under (he. direction of Terry
j Brickley the choruses have been
mastering the intricacies of dance
routines.. There are four large
chorus numbers in the opera this
year. The Blue and White Spy
choruses, led by Boasinki and Gar
ski, leaders of rival Russian fac
tions, form an integral part of the
action of the show. They sing the
"Loyalty Song," a stirring rhythm
used as the finale for the act.
Hclvcnston's Sets
Settings have been designed by
Harold Helvenston and have been
built under the supervision of
George Andreini, especially appoint
ed technical director for this pro

ranged to give the maximum of
space to the dancers and to bring
the emphasis of position upon the
major characters.
Specialty acts are to be a feature
of the last scene in the show. Among
these numbers will be a men's trio
composed of Joe Thompson, Harry

I falis desperately in love.
