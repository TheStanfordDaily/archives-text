# SHOUSE FLAYS HOOVER REGIME AS INEFFICIENT
## Democratic National Leader Predicts End Of G.O.P. Administration CLAIM ISSUES EVADED California Asked To Aid In Ousting President 
### 
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (/P). -
Speaking in President Hoover's
adopted state, Chairman Shouse of
the Democratic National Executive
Committee tonight urged California
to aid in turning the present occu
pant out of the White House in 191)2.
Addressing a Jefferson Day din
ner under auspices of the Demo
cratic State Committee of Califor
nia and the Los Angeles County
Democratic Committee, Shouse pre
dicted his party would win the
Presidency next year but said that
"strenuous, unremitting effort"
would be required.
Predicts Party Change
"A harassed and indignant nation
is preparing, if I read the auguries
correctly," he said, "to rid itself of
the most inept, inadequate, and in
competent administration that fate
has brought to Washington in at
least two decades.
"For more than two years," he
added, "the government of the Uni
ted States has simply drifted. We
have never had action where post
ponement was possible. We have
had avoidance of responsibility when
leadership was poignantly required.
Says Policies Vague
"Not only has nothing been done,
but we have not even had any
statement of policy or principle that
was not so hedged about with quali
fications and so obscured by eva
sions that nobody could clearly read
its meaning.
"Even after two years you will
find people in different parts of the
country arguing from exactly oppo -
site viewpoints what the President
really thinks about the tariff, the
farm problem, prohibition, public
utility control, and in fact every
other major issue that is engrossing
the attention of the nation."
