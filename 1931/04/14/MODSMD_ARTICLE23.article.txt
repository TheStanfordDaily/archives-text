NEW YORK, April 13. Mlâ€”lt's
fair and warmer along the baseball
fronts for the grand opening of the
major league season tomorrow.
Far from feeling any pinch of the
times, the sixteen American and Na
tional League clubs have marshalled
reinforcements, increased the wages
of many of their star performers,
and otherwise set the stage for a
gala getaway as well as a brisk cam
paign and big business all summer
long.
