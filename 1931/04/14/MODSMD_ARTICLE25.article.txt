# THE 						DAYS THAT MAKE US HAPPY

iiehetnny it to be of yeneral interest to Stanford, The
Dai hf today reprints in part "In the Drift amy" from the
April I') issue of "The Nation," where it is a weekly fea
ture:
Higher education as i( is practiced in (his country has
come in for some hard knocks within ttie winter just past.
And it the Drittcr leels constrained to say a word in its
iavor it is not because he would care to deny any of the
strictures that have been passed upon it by critics more
qualified than himself. Aside from the fact that he learned
long ago from a college prof that it is useless to argue
with anyone who doesn't already agree with you, the
Driller would be the tirst to admit to a serious-minded in
vestigator that in his own case the years he spent at college
were wasted. Hut he would still feel that the investigator
was wasting 11 is breath in railing at American universities.
It is not yet a crime even in a democracy to say that
there are fewer excellent brains ill any given group, state,
or nation {ban there are mediocre brains. Keeping that
fact in mind, surely it is a little less than realistic to assume
that universities which are open to all who come—and the
Drifter thinks they should be—can possibly have much
relation to higher education in its strict sense; further, if
we must provide enough teachers to call the rolls, and if
those teachers must have Ph.D/s to get their jobs, it is
patently absurd to expect that very many Ph.D. theses will
have any relation to "real scholarship," whatever that is.
Such assumptions and expectations can lead only to false
hopes and savage sneers, both of which are irrelevant. The
Drifter feels, in short, that Abraham Flexner's Institute for
Advanced Learning, to which only scholars will be ad
mitted for work in "pure science and high scholarship,"!
is much more to the point than Abraham Flexner's book on
the universities.
As a matter of fact, the Drifter, acknowledging a heresy, I
thinks that youngsters learn a great deal in college. And if i
what they learn enters their consciousness during an all-!
night session in a dormitory bedroom instead of in the class j
hour father pays for, at least it is likely to be remembered!
longer and used oftener. The Drifter, for instance, learned ,
a great deal about two subjects not listed in the catalogue i
on a spring afternoon when he went for a walk with a girl!
instead of attending a duly scheduled physiology lab. .Dur-j
ing the stroll an impassioned discussion of careers for
women broke loose; in the midst of which there was dis
covered a hoptoad that had got marooned in a black lake
of tar which the spring sun had treacherously melted. For
hours the Drifter labored heroically with a jackknife. The
battle grew fiercer, and the talk about women grew more j
impassioned, as the afternoon waned and the tar hardened, i
lint Lliza Hoptoad was finally extricated, presumably in
tact, and the woman question was clarified if not settled, j
The moral of this tale is that the' Drifter that day learned j
so much about the texture of a load s hide, the stretch of a
toad's leg, and the quality of a load's patience that he has!
ever since felt a knowing intimacy with hoptoads. Like
wise, he learned so much about women that he has been a|
staunch feminist ever sinc6. These attitudes of his toward
hoptoads and women may not partake of education. He'
thinks they do. Hut he would never presume to call it
higher education.
The Drifter thinks the American university should con-!
tjiiue to be open to all who come. Fvery human being
should have at least one opportunity to lead the remote
and academic existence which the campus provides. Col-i
lege days are like the falsr spring of February that comes j
and goes before the mind can take it in. The only trouble!
with the students the Drifter knew, including himself, was j
that they were so preoccupied with April's plowing that
February's sunshine was only half-experienced. Naturally
they could not know that all their striving would most
likely bring them up against nothing more rewarding than
overproduction and a sharp decline in prices. II is not true
that college students are frivolous-minded. They are in
fact the most serious-minded creatures alive. If Ihcv con -1
ccrn themselves with tirst love and the latest rules of an
autocratic dean, who is to say that these are less wort In
than the price of stocks, the precise date of an early Egyp
tian tax list, or the founding of a political parly? To ap
pease the serious-minded investigators, remove the label
Higher Education from the college gale. Put up instead n
line from the early Mnsefield: "The days thai make us
happy make us wise."
