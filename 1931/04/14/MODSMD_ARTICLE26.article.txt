## THE 						WORLD OF TEXTBOOKS 
### 
Textbook writers delight in paint
ing a most depressing picture of
whatever they happen to be writing
about. They can always show by
points and subpoints that corruption
is undermining democracy—or that
inefficiency is ruining something—
or that the general social fabric is
in shreds. Then after such a pro
cedure has proceeded for about. -100
pages, and the poor student is sit
ting on the edge of his chair, taut
and perspiring, in nervous anticipa
tion for the solution of this terrible
catastrophe whose inevitable cer
tainty wiil soon be realized, he finds
the answer in the last small section
of the book.
The solution is the same no matter
what the evil is; it is 'simply educa
tion, and if you already have educa
tion, then more education, or oven
still more. This magic word is held
to b<? the cure-all for everything—
increasing divorces, decreasing mar
riages, prohibition, unemployment,
world peace, or anything else that
some people think is wrong with
this world. Now we realize that edu
cation, the gift of gods, and the
eternal fountain of spiritual joy is
a glorious thing to be preserved for
the younger generation because even
politicians "recognize the common
biological fact that the children of
today are the fathers of tomorrow."
Now we do not advocate the raz
ing of school houses, the sacking of
libraries, or the burning of books.
What is claimed is that the value of
education as a means of improving
the race is highly over-rated. It
might seem logical that college stu
dents would learn wonderful truths

in the classroom, then trot out to
Ihe world with a diploma tucked
under one arm and the other free
to lead the "masses" to higher and
better things, apply these learned
truths, and then problems would be
solved with magical rapidity.
The truth is, however, that while
students do learn wonderful things,
they are not prone to accept these
ideas as practical ways of action in
the world of realities. Ely proves the
tariff is unsound in Eeon 1, but most
of us persist in holding to our pre
conceived ideas. We learn the scien
tific way to study in psychology, but
few of, us value these "facts" long
enough after the final examination
to apply them to our own studying.
Sociology will teach us the evil'ef
fects of prejudices, yet many of us
revel in certain unfounded notions
which nothing can make us change.
Political science teaches us the value
of voting—yet less than 50 per cent
of the students vote.
It is needless to repeat examples
to show that the student lives in two
worlds—distinct and apart One is
the world of textbooks. In ,this
world, he must use his theoretical
knowledge if it harmonizes with the
successful business men's views of
his acquaintance. If it does not, it is
cast aside like dirty shirts that have
outlived their usefulness.
It is possibly true that generations
of educated people will gradually
evolve a higher type of living, but to
think that four years in college so
completely alters the individual that
John Doe becomes Jonathan Dilling
water, Esquire, is not borne out.

ting on the edge of his chair, taut
and perspiring, in nervous anticipa
tion for the solution of this terrible
catastrophe whose inevitable cer
tainty wiil soon be realized, he finds
the answer in the last small section
of the book.
The solution is the same no matter
what the evil is; it is 'simply educa
tion, and if you already have educa
tion, then more education, or oven
still more. This magic word is held
to b<? the cure-all for everything—
increasing divorces, decreasing mar
riages, prohibition, unemployment,
world peace, or anything else that
some people think is wrong with
this world. Now we realize that edu
cation, the gift of gods, and the
eternal fountain of spiritual joy is
a glorious thing to be preserved for
the younger generation because even
politicians "recognize the common
biological fact that the children of
today are the fathers of tomorrow."
Now we do not advocate the raz
ing of school houses, the sacking of
libraries, or the burning of books.
What is claimed is that the value of
education as a means of improving
the race is highly over-rated. It
might seem logical that college stu
dents would learn wonderful truths

in the classroom, then trot out to
Ihe world with a diploma tucked
under one arm and the other free
to lead the "masses" to higher and
better things, apply these learned
truths, and then problems would be
solved with magical rapidity.
The truth is, however, that while
students do learn wonderful things,
they are not prone to accept these
ideas as practical ways of action in
the world of realities. Ely proves the
tariff is unsound in Eeon 1, but most
of us persist in holding to our pre
conceived ideas. We learn the scien
tific way to study in psychology, but
few of, us value these "facts" long
enough after the final examination
to apply them to our own studying.
Sociology will teach us the evil'ef
fects of prejudices, yet many of us
revel in certain unfounded notions
which nothing can make us change.
Political science teaches us the value
of voting—yet less than 50 per cent
of the students vote.
It is needless to repeat examples
to show that the student lives in two
worlds—distinct and apart One is
the world of textbooks. In ,this
world, he must use his theoretical
knowledge if it harmonizes with the
successful business men's views of
his acquaintance. If it does not, it is
cast aside like dirty shirts that have
outlived their usefulness.
It is possibly true that generations
of educated people will gradually
evolve a higher type of living, but to
think that four years in college so
completely alters the individual that
John Doe becomes Jonathan Dilling
water, Esquire, is not borne out.

Textbook writers delight in paint
