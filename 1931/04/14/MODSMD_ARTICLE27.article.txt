WE TAKE TO BED. By Marsh a i!
McClintock. Jonathan Cape &
Harrison Smith, New York, 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"We Take To Bed" is a book with
very little literary pretenstion but
with a strength of narrative and
unusual interest which makes it a
hard book to put down for a moment
once it has been started.
It is a story of a young married
couple and their baby suddenly up
rooted from the ordinary round of
the struggle for a livelihood by the
discovery that both man and wife
are attacked by the dread TB bug.
Both of them leave the world of
health and take to bed in a sani
tarium for "lungers."
The author tells his story in a
straightforward manner, saving it
from sentimentality by an extraor
linarily objective outlook on life
and disaster. He has very little
"truck" with the ordinary conven- j
tions of novel writing and the dia
logue is sprinkled with the sort of
remark that usually crops up only
in bull sessions.
The ending leaves one with a
sense of incompleteness and despair,
but if you don't feel like consulting i
the family doctor on your own pos
sibilities for TB, or at least sanding ;
sibilities for TB, or at least sending i
sanitarium, by the time you have j
finished the book you are far from i
human. —S.C.A.

THE VIRGIN AND THE GYPSY. By j
D. H. Lawrence. Alfred A. Knopf. j
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
In this allegedly sketchy but quite j
readable novel by the late Mr. Law- '
rence a somewhat startling degree i
of propriety reveals itself. Perhaps I
following the Chatterly business I

anything would be pretty quiet.
Two children of a vicar-made
rector whose wife, tired of the re
pression so necessary for appear
ance's sake has run off with a young
fellow, are brought up in the at
mosphere which so oppressed their
mother. Always over them are the
narrow, suspicious rector, his hor
rible, slobbering mother, his cruelly
righteous sister.
Attempts to escape the encircling
Ei-ip* bring to their aid a gypsy and
a flood which, if a bit melodramatic,
does finish the tale rather more
satisfyingly than it might had the
Old Mater been allowed to dominate
until she died.
P.S.: She remains a virgin—or, at
least, D.H. didn't detail her fall.
—J. S. S.
MACKEREL SKY. By Helen Ash
ton. Doubleday Doran. 1931.
Elizabeth and Gilbert had their
little differences and finally when
the smallest things brought mutual
groans Gilbert ran off with Sybil
and Elizabeth ran to her mother-in
law. This and the good old-fashioned
child-to-be are the storm which,
upon the withdrawal of the quickly
tired Sybil, clear the air for future
happiness of the two.
Quiet mockery is much more
necessary ip Miss Ashton's second
book than it was in "Doctor Sere
cold." Particularly evident and
amusing as an accompaniment to
solemn aisle-traipsings in the open
ing chapter, it sets a mark never
quite attained again during the rest
of the novel.
The book remains, despite critical
huzzahs plastered across its backet
by the Messrs. Doubleday, Doran,
no more than momentarily enter
taining. —J. S. S.

discovery that both man and wife
are attacked by the dread TB bug.
Both of them leave the world of
health and take to bed in a sani
tarium for "lungers."
The author tells his story in a
straightforward manner, saving it
from sentimentality by an extraor
linarily objective outlook on life
and disaster. He has very little
"truck" with the ordinary conven- j
tions of novel writing and the dia
logue is sprinkled with the sort of
remark that usually crops up only
in bull sessions.
The ending leaves one with a
sense of incompleteness and despair,
but if you don't feel like consulting i
the family doctor on your own pos
sibilities for TB, or at least sanding ;
sibilities for TB, or at least sending i
sanitarium, by the time you have j
finished the book you are far from i

THE VIRGIN AND THE GYPSY. By j
D. H. Lawrence. Alfred A. Knopf. j
1930. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
In this allegedly sketchy but quite j
readable novel by the late Mr. Law- '
rence a somewhat startling degree i
of propriety reveals itself. Perhaps I
following the Chatterly business I

anything would be pretty quiet.
Two children of a vicar-made
rector whose wife, tired of the re
pression so necessary for appear
ance's sake has run off with a young
fellow, are brought up in the at
mosphere which so oppressed their
mother. Always over them are the
narrow, suspicious rector, his hor
rible, slobbering mother, his cruelly
righteous sister.
Attempts to escape the encircling
Ei-ip* bring to their aid a gypsy and
a flood which, if a bit melodramatic,
does finish the tale rather more
satisfyingly than it might had the
Old Mater been allowed to dominate
until she died.
P.S.: She remains a virgin—or, at
least, D.H. didn't detail her fall.
—J. S. S.
MACKEREL SKY. By Helen Ash
ton. Doubleday Doran. 1931.
Elizabeth and Gilbert had their
little differences and finally when
the smallest things brought mutual
groans Gilbert ran off with Sybil
and Elizabeth ran to her mother-in
law. This and the good old-fashioned
child-to-be are the storm which,
upon the withdrawal of the quickly
tired Sybil, clear the air for future
happiness of the two.
Quiet mockery is much more
necessary ip Miss Ashton's second
book than it was in "Doctor Sere
cold." Particularly evident and
amusing as an accompaniment to
solemn aisle-traipsings in the open
ing chapter, it sets a mark never
quite attained again during the rest
of the novel.
The book remains, despite critical
huzzahs plastered across its backet
by the Messrs. Doubleday, Doran,
no more than momentarily enter
taining. —J. S. S.
WE TAKE TO BED. By Marsh a i!
McClintock. Jonathan Cape &

(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"We Take To Bed" is a book with
very little literary pretenstion but
with a strength of narrative and
unusual interest which makes it a
hard book to put down for a moment
once it has been started.
It is a story of a young married
couple and their baby suddenly up
rooted from the ordinary round of
the struggle for a livelihood by the
discovery that both man and wife
are attacked by the dread TB bug.
Both of them leave the world of
health and take to bed in a sani
tarium for "lungers."
