Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of Bur
gundy! Members of the weaker sex
among us are training for sewing
circles and book-review clubs, with
committees, committees and com
mittee cha(i)r women, hoping to do
things in a bigger and better way
for athletic womanhood.
Seems we have a gymnasium to
be dedicated with fireworks this
week-end. Also a lot of alumni to
be properly impressed. It's always
been enough for them, before, to be
shown to their own ex-houses, and
to yell at one another across the
Stadium. But this time they're going
on a tour of inspection. No one
wants to play specimen, but we'll
be on deck. After all, even the Class

umpteen brothers of Alpha Alpha

the nuggets who had graced the

frosh innocently.
"Joe Blow is an Alpha Beta Alph,"
said Blotz. "He's not in this house."
"That's funny," said the frosh. "He
! told me to come up to see him at
the Alpha Bete house tonight." He
left without further comment, and
we will give you three guests as to
the name of one of the houses he
won't pledge. The funny part of
, Ihis yarn is it's true.

He says, "I think college girls
represent the highest type of
American womanhood, don't
you?"
