# GERMAN PACT WILL NOT LEAD TO WAR IN EUROPE-ROWELL
## 
### 
! The recent treaty negotiated bc-
I tween Germany and Austria for
free trade between themselves, and
for identical tariff rates on imports
1 from other countries will not result
in war, in spite of Aristide Briand's
i startling statement: "This means
i war," in the opinion of Chester H.
Rowell, well-known columnist and
I authority on international relations.
"The question to be settled is
whether or not Germany and Aus
! tria have a right to enter into the
, agreement," Rowell said. "France
I says 'no'; Germany and Austria say
| post-war treaties limit Germany and
' Austria in this respect.
"The matter will be settled one
! way or the other by the World
i Court," Rowell continued. "That is
j the only reason it doesn't threaten
i war in Europe. If it is decided that
I it is within the power of Germany
and Austria to make the treaty," he
j concluded, "France will not make
; war; if not, France won't dare do it."'
It is distinctly a juridicial matter,
to be settled by the World Court,
! after every other method has been
! tried, Rowell believes. Negotiation
i and arbitration will not adjust the
j dispute.
