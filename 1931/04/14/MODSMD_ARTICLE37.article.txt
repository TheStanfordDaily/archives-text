Jt seems a dirty trick to jump on
a man when he's down, but in view
of that 103-28 barbecue down Los
Angeles way last week, it is asking
almost too much to refrain from
kidding that dean of American hu
morists, Clinton R. '"Brick - ' Morse,
who entertains readers of the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin with the in
side dope on California athletics, so-

Friend Morse had reached the
stage, prior to Saturday, where
he honestly believed the Blue
and Gold had a track team. Mr. i
Morse does that annually, it is
true, whenever he sees a left
handed pole-vaulter or a
pigeon-toed hurdler stumbling
around the California oval, but
this season he had almost suc
ceeded in making other people
believe the same.
Mr. Morse is a kindly old soul,
lifted with a gorgeous imagination,
lis kindliness makes it absolutely
mpossible for him to say of a
vould-be California athlete that he
s not potentially a world-beater. As
i matter of fact, if all of Mr. Morse's
judding record-breakers were laid
•nd to end, it would be a great im
>rovement.
Said kindliness, when coupled
with the imagination enabling
him to see 4:45 miters suddenly
transformed into 4:20 runners,
apparently went to Mr. Morse's
head. Southern California, he
admitted, was a little too much
for Walt Christie's men, but the
Big Meet was practically a toss
up. So he perpetrated, in bis
column, the choicest bit ol com
edy seen since George Ade was
in his heyday.
. <j> *>
As near as we can remember, it
an something like this:
"In the relay, California has no
uartermilers who can run as fast
s Eastman, Hables, and other Stan
3rd boys, but they have four men
/ho can run pretty close to 50 flat.
laybe, in the Big Meet, those Stan
3rd boys will drop the baton, or
jmething, and California's relay
:am will breeze through to a rec
rd."
Now anyone who has ever seen
ie California relay team, or even
jad about it, with the possible cx
?ption of Mr. Morse, knows that
le Stanford quartet could not only
rop the baton, but kick i f out of
le Stadium, saunter leisurely out
do to retrieve it and return in time
>r a cup of coffee before beating
le Bear four by 20 yards. Never
lcless, Mr. Morse went on public
■cord as set down above.
Were it anyone but Mr. Morse,
one would merely have to say
"103 to 28,*' and the offender
would stagger drunkenly with
mortification and chagrin. But
having seen the perennial Cali
fornian take them on the lug in
like manner before, and return
for more before the week had
elapsed, we look forward eagerly
to Mr. Morse's prognostications
of a California ISig Meet vic
tory, to be published in Friday's
(ail-Bulletin.

almost too much to refrain from
kidding that dean of American hu
morists, Clinton R. '"Brick - ' Morse,
who entertains readers of the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin with the in
side dope on California athletics, so-

Friend Morse had reached the
stage, prior to Saturday, where
he honestly believed the Blue
and Gold had a track team. Mr. i
Morse does that annually, it is
true, whenever he sees a left
handed pole-vaulter or a
pigeon-toed hurdler stumbling
around the California oval, but
this season he had almost suc
ceeded in making other people
believe the same.
Mr. Morse is a kindly old soul,
lifted with a gorgeous imagination,
lis kindliness makes it absolutely
mpossible for him to say of a
vould-be California athlete that he
s not potentially a world-beater. As
i matter of fact, if all of Mr. Morse's
judding record-breakers were laid
•nd to end, it would be a great im
>rovement.
Said kindliness, when coupled
with the imagination enabling
him to see 4:45 miters suddenly
transformed into 4:20 runners,
apparently went to Mr. Morse's
head. Southern California, he
admitted, was a little too much
for Walt Christie's men, but the
Big Meet was practically a toss
up. So he perpetrated, in bis
column, the choicest bit ol com
edy seen since George Ade was
in his heyday.

As near as we can remember, it
an something like this:
"In the relay, California has no
uartermilers who can run as fast
s Eastman, Hables, and other Stan
3rd boys, but they have four men
/ho can run pretty close to 50 flat.
laybe, in the Big Meet, those Stan
3rd boys will drop the baton, or
jmething, and California's relay
:am will breeze through to a rec
rd."
Now anyone who has ever seen
ie California relay team, or even
jad about it, with the possible cx
?ption of Mr. Morse, knows that
le Stanford quartet could not only
rop the baton, but kick i f out of
le Stadium, saunter leisurely out
do to retrieve it and return in time
>r a cup of coffee before beating
le Bear four by 20 yards. Never
lcless, Mr. Morse went on public
■cord as set down above.
Were it anyone but Mr. Morse,
one would merely have to say
"103 to 28,*' and the offender
would stagger drunkenly with
mortification and chagrin. But
having seen the perennial Cali
fornian take them on the lug in
like manner before, and return
for more before the week had
elapsed, we look forward eagerly
to Mr. Morse's prognostications
of a California ISig Meet vic
tory, to be published in Friday's
(ail-Bulletin.
