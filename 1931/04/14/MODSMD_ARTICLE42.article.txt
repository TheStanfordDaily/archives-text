# BABE DIAMOND MEN TO WIND UP SERIES IN SAN MATEO, BEAK FROSH TUSSLES
## 
### 
This week will see the windup of
the season for the Cardinal Babe
j diamond men. San Mateo Junior
! College is scheduled to clash with
I the yearlings at 3:15 o'clock this
| afternoon on the freshman practice
j field and next Friday afternoon the
' babes will meet California at Berke-
J ley in the deciding game of their
I series with the Golden Beaij Cubs.
San Mateo can be expected to
j offer the Cardinals a warm session
!as they boast of having adminis
i tered the Bear Cubs a trouncing on
I the Californians' home ground.
Savinske should twirl for the
i Stanfordites today and unless his
i teammates car give him better sup
j port than Anderson had at Berkeley
! Saturday he will have difficulty in
! holding the invaders in check.
It may be that playing on a
} strange field had a lot to do with
j the four errors chalked up against
i the Cardinals in the last fracas with
! U.C. The infield at Southwest field
I in Berkeley was soft and consider
: ably slower than the Babes' home
| field.

! Several times during Saturday's !
affair, the Cardinals loaded up the |
bases on O'Connor until the latter i
waS' sweating copiously from his j
place on the mound, but always the j
California fiinger managed to squeeze i
out of the tight places by the nar- I
rowest of margins.
Batting Weak
The only occasion that the Stan- j
ford batting attack worked effec- '
tively was in the ninth inning when |
Miles corked out a hit that drove
in Hearn and Goldmann after J
O'Connor had filled up the bases ;
with two men out.
Coach Murray Cuddeback has
been rarely able to play two con
secutive games with the same lineup
but in both of last week's games
with Menlo and California the team I
presented the same arrangement
with the exception of the batteries. !
Right now the combination of Hearn
at first; Holms, second; Maentz,
shortstop; Robinson, third; and
Goldmann, Miles, and Buller patrol
ling the outfields looks permanent
i for the last brace of games.

place on the mound, but always the j
California fiinger managed to squeeze i
out of the tight places by the nar- I
rowest of margins.
Batting Weak
The only occasion that the Stan- j
ford batting attack worked effec- '
tively was in the ninth inning when |
Miles corked out a hit that drove
in Hearn and Goldmann after J
O'Connor had filled up the bases ;
with two men out.
Coach Murray Cuddeback has
been rarely able to play two con
secutive games with the same lineup
but in both of last week's games
with Menlo and California the team I
presented the same arrangement
with the exception of the batteries. !
Right now the combination of Hearn
at first; Holms, second; Maentz,
shortstop; Robinson, third; and
Goldmann, Miles, and Buller patrol
ling the outfields looks permanent
i for the last brace of games.
