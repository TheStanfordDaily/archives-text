# QUARTER ENDS WITH INFORMAL PRACTICE PLANNED FOR BABES
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track team,
having- added another link to Coach
Bill Ellington's eight-year chain of
pleasant memories re "Little Big
Meets," settled down to informal,
thricc-a-week spring practice yes
terday.
Although there will be less ten
sion and no compulsion, there will
be almost as much work as during
the regular season. Many of the
freshmen have been bringing futu
ristic smiles to the face of Dink
Templeton, and "Take your own
work - outs is a phrase seldom
abused by trackmen with a future.
John Lyman, most promising frosh
weight man since Eric Krenz, will
be striving for form this spring. Dis
tance he has already attained, his
48-foot 2-inch heave of the 16-
pound shot having seat up a new
"Little Big Meet" record.
Captain Dave Packard, who tallied
18 points by himself in this meet,
will be busy with the hurdles,
jumps, and discus, if he does not
decide to join Coach John Bunn's
spring basketball practice.
