# Big Meet Promises Thrills in Distance Runs
## BEARS CONCEDED LITTLE CHANGE IN FIELD OR SPRINTS California Pole â€“ Vaulters Gave Poor Showing Against Trojans 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Undergraduate interest on Uni
versity Day, Saturday, will center
in the Stadium, where Coach Dink
Templeton's trackmen tangle with
the California Bears in what appears
io be the next in a long succession
of Stanford Big Meet victories.
With the California baseball series
already tucked away, and the In
dian rtetmen a cinch to defeat the
Berkeley invaders in the morning,
all that remains to round out Stan
ford's spring sport supremacy is the
average performance of Templeton's
outfit.
Boars Trounced
Up until Saturday, when the
Bears bowed so humbly to Dean
Cromwell's Trojans in Los Angeles,
prospects pointed to the most evenly
contested Big Meet for some time.
Undoubtedly Christie's athletes were
off form against the strong Red and
Gold aggregation, but accepted weak
spots in the California team showed
even weaker than had been ex
pected.
As a result of the debacle at
Southern California, the Blue and
Gold will enter the meet Saturday
against ovei'whelming Indian odds.
Nevertheless, any competition with
California is bound to be spiced
with enough rivalry to satisfy the
most fastidious appetite for thrills.
Christie's Stars
Good performances may be ex
pected from Christie's men in sev
eral events. Farm fans should get
tiuite a thrill out of watching Ken
Churchill throw the javelin, not
having seen a record-breaking
spear-tosser for several seasons. The
two-mile will be an exciiing and
interesting duel, with Paul Aeber
sold of Stanford and Captain Spud
Mossman of California struggling for
the lead in the stretch.
Mossman, in fact, will be a threat
in both distance runs. As many will
remember, this sturdy runner took
first in both the mile and two-mile
last year. Aebersold, running only
one event, should have a slight edge
over the Bear captain in the latter
and longer of the two grinds.
Vaulters Good
Poole and Vantress, Berkeley
vaulters who have gone as high as
13 feet 11 inches and 13 feet 0
inches, respectively, this year, were
unable to reach 13 feet against Troy.
DeGroot, Deacon, and Johns of the
Indians are fairly consistent around
13 feet, and the vaulting event may
prove more entertaining than Berke
ley prophets have imagined.
This boy Sparks has been show
ing up as the first real sprinter in
a long time up at U.C. He has been
clocked as low as 9.7 seconds in the
century this season. Last Saturday
he finished about three yards be
hind Frank Wykoff, who made the
100 yards in 9.7. Against Dyer, Les
Hables, and Lombardi, Sparks will
get the severe test of his sprinting
career Saturday.
Last, but far from least, Farm en
thusiasts will have the treat of
watching Ben Eastman, the sopho
more 440 sensation. Although he will
be racing more or less against time
at his chosen distance, there is al
ways the possibility that a world
record will be cracked when East
man takes his marks at the start of
the one-lap event.
The Langley medal voted to Rear
Admiral Richard E. Byrd was pre
sented to him by Chief Justice
i Hughes.
