# MALONEY SELECTS FRESHMAN FENCERS FOR BEAR MATCHES
## 
### 
Indian freshman fencers who will
meet California at Berkeley Friday
night have been selected by Head
Fencing Coach Harry Maloney and
his assistant, Elwyn Bugge.
The five men chosen to cross
swords with the Bear Cubs are
Richard Criley, Mackenzie Gordon,
A1 Snyder, and Wiilard Stone. All
of this group have been working for
the past two quarters in preparation
for the annual freshman encounter
and should make things interesting
for the California yearlings.
Criley is the most experienced
man on the squad and is being
counted on to win all five of his
bouts. Snyder in a recent open foils
meet reached the finals, displaying
considerable ability in doing so. The
other three men are all showing
good form and can be expected to
give the Bexkeleyites a hard-fought
battle.
Both Coach Maloney and Coach
Bugge are working with the men
this week in preparation for Fri
day's matches.
