## 
### 
â– 
In (he only intramural baseball I
game played yesterday on the new
intramural diamond the Alpha Delts
defeated El Capitan in a closely con
tested and well played game 8 to 7.
Harry Plymire did the hurling for |
the Row team and except for one I
| or two tight places had things all his
| way. Kenneth Hale did the l'eceiv- <
; ing for Plymire.
The score shows the closeness
!of the battle and the Clubmen
j threatened several times to win the i
| tilt. However the steady pitching of
Plymire staved off several attempt-
j ed rallies on the part of the Club
squad.
All games in the intramural series j
are being played on the old Sequoia I
field and the diamond located be
tween the Polo field and the Grays'
practice gridiron.
Parker Reed is in charge of the J
schedule and official scorings for all 1
games.
