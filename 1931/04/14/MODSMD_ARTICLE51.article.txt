# PITCHER JOHNSON FEARED LOST ON EVE OF U.C. TILT
## 
### 
FRANTIC telephone calls to
" the Breakers!
Time, Friday evening before
the second California baseball
game and Harry Wolter on the
phone. "Have you seen Dan
Johnson?" The mystery thick
ened as no trace of Johnson
could be found.
Managers, campus cops, an J1
the local constabulary of May
field and Palo Alto were sect
out on the trail of possible
Berkeley kidnappers who w fre
planning to use the Im'fian
pitcher in place of the lates la
mented Axe.
Meanwhile, out on the 17th
green trying to keep his score
out of three figures, Dan John
son, unaware that he uas the
cause of any excitement, pro
ceeded to sink his putt for a
natty seven.
The confusion arose from the
differing definition of the word
"dinner." Harry Wolter had ex
tended an invitation to John
son to come up to his house
for dinner before the California
game. The latest "commc-il
faut" at the Breakers has din
ner represented as a noon-time
meal, while at the abode of
Coach Wolter dinner was con
sidered an evening perform
ance.
