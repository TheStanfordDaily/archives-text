# VARSITY NET TEAM HAS ONE DOUBLES RANKING PLAY-OFF
## 
### 
There will be no more single ten
nis ranking matches for the rest of
f the quarter, as the California
j matches are to be played on Satur
j day. However, one doubles ranking
| will be decided on Wednesday when
Forbes and Butler play Cox and
\ Niederauer.
Freshman rankings will continue
to be played from week to week in
order to give the yearlings sufficient
practice so that they will be in
j shape to compete for the varsity
1 next season. There will be at least
j four vacancies in this year's first ten
i which will have to be filled.
Chuck Otis gives every indication
of being excellent varsity material.
Otis completed the past season with
out having suffered a defeat, and
last Saturday in taking the measure
of Whitman, a tennis player of no
mean ability, Otis definitely proved
1 his ability.
