## Team's Batting Average Shows Reason For Card Success

Horatio Alger, ancl other such
"substitute-Smith-scores - winning
point - for - old - Podunk" authors,
would be extremely pleased by the
situation which bids i'air to develop
this week and next in regards to the
Stanford baseball team.
A conference championship virtu
ally depends on whether or not a
pitcher can be found who can get
the ball over the plate sufficiently
often during the course of a nine
inning game so that the Card in
fielders can make the necessary 27
put-outs.
Pitching Problem
Who will be the fair-haired indi
! vidual? Last year, when the winning
lor losing of one more ball game
meant very little to Stanford hopes,
' Lefty Leverenz surprised all and
; sundry by turning back the unde
feated Trojans in masterful style.
Lack of control has been the only
thing which has kept Ernie Caddel
out of the winning column as he
| has all the "stuff" and the fight
| which goes to make up a good
i pitcher. By far the steadiest chueker,
i not counting Johnson, is Vard
; Loomis, but as yet he has failed to
! complete a nine-inning game.
| One very good reason for the In
dians' success so far this season was
j revealed in an unofficial team bat
ting average of .307. Furthermore
Dykes Johnson is leading the team
; in hitting with an average of .420,
which is indeed a "fancy" percent
j age.

' his little satchel, Harry Wolter is be
ginning to plan about the possibility
of a conference pennant.
In order to assure themselves of a
clear hold on a pennant, the Cards
have to take all four of the remain
ing games, which means that an
S.F.U. game has just as much im
; portance as the California game next
I Saturday.
