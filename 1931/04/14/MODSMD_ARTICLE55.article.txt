# CHOIR TO PRESENT POEMS IN RECITAL TOMORROW NIGHT
## Verse-Speaking Chorus Is Here Under Auspices Of Y.W.C.A. 
### 
Interpreting poetry by recitation
and action to demonstrate the possi
bilities of the human voice speaking
en masse, the verse-speaking choir
of the San Jose State College under
the direction of Elizabeth Jenks will
give a program tomorrow evening
at 7:30 o'clock in the Women's Club
house. The program will be given
for Stanford students and Palo Alto
residents under the auspices of the
Y.W.C.A.
Twenty Members
First of its kind in the state, the
choir consists of 20 students chosen
for their voice quality and origi
nality. The importance of pitch, ca
dence, rhythm, and gesture are all
calculated in producing the effects
achieved by the choir. Groupings
and lighting add immensely to the
effectiveness of the choir's offerings.
According to James C. De Voss,
of San Jose State, the audience dis
covers wholly new meanings in old
selections when presented by this
group of trained voices. He states
that the surprise of first hearing
this choir is comparable to listening
to a first radio program or seeing
one's first moving picture. Every
audience has shown enthusiastic ap
preciation.
Started in England
Verse reading first started in Eng
land and was used for work with
children. It was brought to the
United States by Miss Elizabeth
Keppie of the Pasadena Junior Col
lege who saw the English choir in a
program at the Greek theatre at
Delphi. Dr. Virginia Sanderson of
Ihe San Jose State College was the
first person to start a choir in Cali
fornia.
Mrs. Margaret Pascoe, 1465 Web
ster, will be in charge of ticket dis
tribution in Palo Alto and on the
campus. Tickets, which are 35 cents,
may be obtained at the A.S.S.U.
office, the Y.W.C.A. rooms in the
Women's Clubhouse, and at all liv
ing groups.
