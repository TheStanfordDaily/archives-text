# GODLESS PARADES FEATURE RUSSIAN EASTER FETE DAY
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Apr. 13 (/P).—Demon
strations of the godless were staged
as counter attractions to the Rus
sian Orthodox-Easter but they failed
to detract from the enthusiasm of
thousands who crowded Moscow's
500 churches for the special services.
Bands of young atheists singing
anti-religious songs held mock serv
ices in the sti'eets of the capital,
flaunting banners inscribed: "Down
with Jesus Christ," and "Long Live
Leninism." Old tram-cars were fit
ted as altars and manned by youth
ful mockers as they were pushed
through the city.
For hours before the services in
the churches started at midnight
Saturday, crowds strove to gain en
trance into the churches, the num
ber of which has been depleted by
1,100 in the last few years. Many
were bruised in the crush.
The government did not intervene,
even favoring the services with an
order prohibiting atheistic speeches
just outside the churches. Another
order forbade the ringing of church
bells on the ground that it would
wreck the sleep of workers.
