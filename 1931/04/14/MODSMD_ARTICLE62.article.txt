## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 13. (/P)
â€”The bill to repeal Illinois' prohibi
tion enforcement acts was vetoed
today by Governor Louis L. Emmer
son.
Passed by the Illinois House of
Representatives 91 to 56 and by the
State Senate 26 to 24, the O'Grady-
McDermott bill, which would have
set aside the Illinois pi-ohibition act
and the state search and seizure act,
was returned by the Governor with
out his approval.
"It attempts to nullify the provi
sions of the eighteenth amendment,"
he explained in a message accom
panying his veto. "I am not for
nullification. Destructive principles
which do not protect the lives and
homes of all our citizens will not
afford a solution of the liquor prob
lem."
