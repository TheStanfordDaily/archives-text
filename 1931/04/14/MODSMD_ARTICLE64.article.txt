# GRAPE WINE MAKERS TO BE PROSECUTED
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Apr. 13 (/P).
Prohibition Director Woodcock
served notice today that the makers
of grape concentrates fermentable
into wine will be prosecuted when
ever it can be proved their product
is sold with "intent" that it become
"intoxicating in fact."
In answer to a letter from the
Washington headquarters of the
Crusaders, the Federal dry chief re
iterated his stand upon the sale of
grape concentrates.
Woodcock replied that prosecu
tions against grape concentrate con
cerns would be made as soon as
"intent" could be proved, but added
that "the practical difficulty of the
proof of such unlawful intent" often
constituted a problem.
