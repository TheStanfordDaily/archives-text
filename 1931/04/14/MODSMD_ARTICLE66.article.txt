# BELGIAN PRINCE TO STUDY METHODS OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium, Apr, 13 (/P).
—Always happier in the blue denim
of mechanics' overalls than in the
royal purple of court attire, Prince
Charles of the Belgians has gone to
America to study the methods of
Thomas A. Edison, Henry Ford, and
other industrial geniuses of the New
World.

The second son of King Albert was
revealed today as having sailed in
cognito April 4 on the Red Star
steamer • Pennland for New York,
registering under the name of
Charles Derethy. He is scheduled to
dock tomorrow.

The prince plans to stay two
months in America. He will visit the
Baldwin locomotive works, the Edi
son laboratories, and the Ford plant,
as well as Niagara Fails, the Yo
semite Valley, and other scenic
points, traveling to the Pacific Coast
before he returns.
The prince is a clever engineer,
mechanical and locomotive, and an
expert automobile repairman. He
has often expressed a desire for a
working career.
