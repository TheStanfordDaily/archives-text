# PRIVATELY OWNED PRINTING PRESSES IN OPERATION HERE
## Publication Of Manuscripts In Limited Editions Is Art, Says Jackson 
### 
Stanford possesses an unusual
number of individually owned and
operated printing presses, according
to Hartley Jackson, typographical
designer for the University Press.
"Small presses are' usually born
of three circumstances," Jackson
said in an interview for the Daily,
"the fascination in typesetting for
people who have never done any
thing of the sort, a printing press
with which to do the work, and
the attraction to an individual of
certain writings whose appeal is 100
small to warrant commercial pub
lication.

j "There are a number of such pri
| vate presses in England, the most
I famous of which is the Kelmscott
Press owned by William Morris. The
j best-known publication of this press
j was the Kelmscott Chaucer. The
j Doves Press, a close second in im
portance, published an edition of
the Bible very valuable and inter
esting for designers today.
Stanford Presses
"At Stanford, interest in this sort
i of work has been particularly keen.
1 The Half Moon Press, run by Ruth
i Mantz, now a teacher at San Mateo
(Junior College, has printed a book
! of poems by Bunichi Kagawa,Â«'Hid-
I den Flame.'
i "Professor Edwin C. Starks of the
Zoology department is the owner of
J the Garret Press and has made im
-1 prints of three volumes of which he
t is the author: 'Tire Tracks on Eng
j lish Roads,' 'My Smooth Log of the
; Orient,' and 'Our Dutch Uncles.'
"Later in establishment comes the
Yerba Buena Press owned by Na
than van Patten, University li
brarian, and me. We have com
pleted three limited editions of
books: 12 copies of 'The Valley of
[ the Shadow' by Edwin Arlington
Robinson; 'On Visiting Bookshops,'
by Christopher Morley, 60 copies of
j which were made for presentation
I to the Roxburghe Club of San Fran
cisco; and a 'Letter from Cornwall'
by D. H. Lawrence, 5 copies of which
i were printed for Mrs. Kate Felton
Elkins, donor of the Felton library.
Machen's Letters
"We are at present wroking on a
collection of 66 letters by Arthur
Machen written to his friend Henry
Savage. These letters are the prop
erty of Van Patten.
"Last comes the Harvest Press, the
property of James Hart and myself,
whose first imprint was 'At the Sign
of the World's End,' by Gilbert K.
Chesterton. We are about to issue an
unpublished manuscript of Ambrose
Bierce called 'Battleships and
Ghosts.' One hundred and ten copies
will be made.
"Facilities for this sort of work
are, of course, limited. The type is
usually set by hand, is printed fre
| quently on hand-made paper, the
book is beautifully bound, and each
copy js numbered. The size of the
edition is determined by the num
-1 ber of the publisher's friends. Al
| though the time necessary to pro
-1 duce a book varies greatly, an artis-
I tic piece of work can usually be
i realized at the end of a few months."
