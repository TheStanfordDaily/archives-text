sea eel eggs. These embryo fish,
called bdellostoma, are possessors
of the lowest order of brains among
existing vertebrates.
Nevertheless, says Dr. J. Le Roy
Conel, professor of anatomy, their
1 brains have five parts found in the
| fully developed human brain. These
, parts have the same functions as
Unan's. The fish have even the be
