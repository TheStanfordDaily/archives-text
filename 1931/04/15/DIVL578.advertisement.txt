What's YOUR
favorite
pipe 'Vfvju,
Most PRINCETON
men smoke—
IF you walk along Prospect Street
in Princeton you'll notice how
many men load their pipes from
the familiar blue Edgeworth tin.
At Senior Singing on the steps of
Nassau Hall this spring the pipes
will glow with Edgeworth.
A pipe and Edgeworth—this is
the smoking combination that has
won the college man. Yale, Dart
mouth, Cornell, Illinois, Stanford
... all agree with Princeton.
College men everywhere respond
to the appeal of pipes—packed with
cool, slow-burning Edgeworth. Be
guided by their choice: Try Edge
worth yourself. Taste its rich nat
ural savor that is enhanced im
measurably by Edgeworth's dis
tinctive eleventh process.
You will find Edgeworth at your
nearest tobacco shop—lsff the tin.
