Summoning
a Ghost to your
The chemist Van Helmontin 1609 discov
ered an invisible substance, an emanation
from coal, that he named "geist," meaning
ghost, shortened in English to gas.
Only now do its miraculous possibilities
begin to be glimpsed. Only now can mod
ern industry, like a latter-day Aladdin rub
bing his lamp to summon a vaporous genii,
turn a valve and order this Ghost to any
one of a hundred tasks.
From the beginning, the problem was one
of piping. When Crane Co., a half century
ago, set itself to develop and produce the
right materials for every gas and oil purpose,
it bewail an incalculably valuable contribu
tion to the solution of problems that had
held back the gas industry since the Chinese
used hollow bamboo.
So in the development of the natural and
manufactured gas industry, as in practically
every other industry, the Crane line of
valves, fittings, fabricated piping, and
specialties have played an important part.
No matter what branch of industry you
enter, you will find Crane materials playing
a similarly important part.
