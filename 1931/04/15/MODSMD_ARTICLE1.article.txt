# LAST BOURBON ABDICATES FOR REPUBLICANISM
## Ancient Spanish Monarchy Yields To Demand Of Subject People MANIFESTO EXPECTED Republican Leader Zamora Appoints Cabinet 
### 
MADRID, April 14. (/P)â€” Yielding ;
Id the will of his people, King Al- 1
fonso XIII, last of the Bourbon <
dynasty, abdicated the ancient
throne / of Spain late today and a
republic was immediately estab
lished amid scenes of wildest enthu
siasm. I
The Spanish monarchy, hundreds
of years old and once the most pow
erful in the world, fell at six o'clock
this evening, succumbing at last to j
the tide of republicanism which |
washed away its supoprts in the
municipal elections Sunday.
/amora Takes Charge
Niceto Alacala Zamora, republi
can leader who only recently was
released from jail, immediately took
charge of the government as pro
visional president and appointed a
new cabinet.
With tremendous cheering, ex
cited crowds surged through the
streets and republican flags appeared
as if by magic in the windows of
buildings and in automobiles. Rafael
Sanchez Guerra, son of the famous
crusader for Spanish constitutional
ism, hoisted the republican flag over
the department of the interior while
a great multitude, packed in the
Puerta del Sol, the Times Square
of Madrid, shouted deliriously.
Leaves for Portugal
King Alfonso was reported to have
left the royal palace shortly there
after by automobile, presumably foi;
Portugal. . He was accompanied by
an intimate friend, a police officer,
and several republican leadei's who
were said to have guaranteed him
safe passage from the country.
Queen Victoria and the royal fam- !
ily planned to leave tomorrow
morning, either by train or auto- |
mobile.
The retiring monarch was quoted
by friends as not wishing to depart ;
without his family but deferred to j
the advice and guarantees of repub
lican leaders that they would be
guarded and respected. In leaving, j
he was quoted as saying:
"Goodbye until we return."
Manifesto Expected
President Alcala Zamora and re
tiring Premier Aznar were in con- i
tinuous conference to arrange the j
conditions under which the trans
fer of powers to the new govern- j
ment could be effected. The former
is expccted to publish a manifesto
to the nation laying down the broad
lines of a provisional constitution by !
which the nation will be gov
erned pending a meeting of the j
Cortes and adoption of a permanent
charter of liberty.
The first act of the new govern- J
ment will be to grant amnesty and !
nders already have been transmit- |
ted by telephone and telegraph stip
ulating that political prisoners be ;
reed at once. The government is
heoretically in charge of Premier
\znar until the new ministers can
idopt a working program.
