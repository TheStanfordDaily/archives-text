# BEETLES WRECK COCOANUTS-PLANS OF FIVE HUNDRED
## 
### 
poCGANUT BEETLES and
the pineapple season arc the
only things failing to co-oper
ate in the campaign of the
women's gym committee for
University Day.
When a Stanford alumnus in
the Philippines was sent a
frantic radiogram request for
cocoanuts to sell in the fruit
market of the KalTee Klatsch,
he willingly promised at least
a ton. But when he tried to
arrange their shipment, the
plans fell through! A havoc
raising cocoanut beetle had
caused a quarantine measure
forbidding importation of the
nuts into California.
Besides, edible cocoanuts do
not bear up well on a long
ocean voyage. They sprout,
burst their shells, and the co
coanut milk escapes, and
they're not really cocoanuts
when they finally arrive.
Pineapples were another
commodity with which the
women wished to swell the
funds. But. alas, pineapples are
not ripe in Hawaii, and "Jim
my" Dole had to refuse his aid.
