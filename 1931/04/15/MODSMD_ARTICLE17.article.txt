Although the spring bawlout con
| tains only five Pages, sundry in
teresting data can be gathered from
a perusal of this quarterly who's
1 who, which is on sale at the Cash
! ier's office today.
A composite picture of the Stan
ford rough is offered by Pate, Hare,
! Chin, Noack, Eyster, Brouse, Lip
: sitch, Erhorn, Amies, Hand. Thum,
' two Footes, Shinbo, and Kneisley.
! His interior is typified by Hart,
Lungs, Brainerd, Livermore, and
Vizzard. He has a thick Beard, also
Bangs—dresses in Shirk, Shorts,
Coats, and Cordry, as well as Sox
and Spaghts.
j In true rough style, he is Brauns,
Tally, Strong, Fair, Hardy, Gay, and
Laughlin. And as some of the 500
may agree, he has Armstrong as
Atlas.
As to be expected, there is no
Lake in the bawlout this spring, but
if there were more Waters, the pres
' ent Meadow would bo busily

i aquatic, what with a Skow, a Ferry,
numerous Shippey's, Sales, Wessels,
and other Botasof. Six Fishers might
i be attracted to the Banks by Pike,
Bass, and Strout;.
The Farm motif is pleasantly car
ried out by Fields in Bloom, by
Hay, Barns, Binns, Coopers for the
Fowle, Green Lanes, Lavender Poin
sett, a Conn Patch, and three Gard
ners to take care of the one Hoag.
Like Rome, the University offers
seven Hills. Bushes, Crabtree, Mar
pie, Chestnut, and Cherry trees dot
the campus. Churchill Bells Ring
from a Hightower when the Bell
mer catches Holt of his Rcnch.
Curiously enough, the Nutts have
appreciably high bawlout averages.
Other statistical scraps gathered
that the Youngs are abundant and
no student in the bawlout is Old.
Contrary to masculine dominance,
there are three Nourses registered,
i but no Doctor. The favorite diet ap
pears to be Hainan Oggs. And(erson)
