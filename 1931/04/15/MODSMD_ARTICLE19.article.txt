# ELEVEN LIVES LOST IN CHICAGO TUNNEL WHEN FIRE STRIKES
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 14. (/Piâ€”An Un
; derground inferno of flame and
fumes snuffed out eleven lives to
day, but calm judgment and valiant
effort won freedom from a deep,
| blazing tomb for 16 other men.
With stunning swiftness the
flames licked at the sawdust tinder
and (he dry timbers lining the new
j concrete tubing of a sanitary dis
i trict sewerage tunnel under 22nd
| street, one of the principal east-
J west thoroughfares on the southwest
; side.
Workmen and firemen were stifled
j by poisonous gases in the subter-
I ranean trap. Some died in frantic
breaks for the elevator shaft that led
! to freedom and life. Sixteen locked
! themselves in a 30-foot au 1 chamber
\ and waited through a night of hor
j ror for the chance of escape that
came after 16 hours.
j Fifty-one workers and firemen, in
I all, were treated at hospitals for
j burns, injuries, exhaustion, and the
perilous effects of inhaled smoke,
i All were expected to recover.
