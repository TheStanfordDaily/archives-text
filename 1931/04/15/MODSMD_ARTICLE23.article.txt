# Near Sell-Out Indicated For Russian Show
## Comedy Drama Arouses Wide Interest 
### 
With only a small number of seats
for "Proletariat Plus," the Junior
Opera, remaining unsold, campus
support of the Russian comedy is
assured, A1 Denney, Dramatic Coun
cil manager, declared last night.
Tales of bewhiskered bolshevists,
dangerous Soviets, Russian vamps,
and sophisticated Americans, who
have been gathering every night in
the Assembly Hall, have aroused
widespread interest, and a full house
Friday night is certain, he said.
The plot of the Cameron-Lorton
production centers around the at
tempts of two rival factions to gain
control of a Russian factory, involv
ing the hero in a series of compli
cations from which he escapes only
with difficulty. It is conventional
only in that it has a happy ending.
Sets designed by Harold Helven
ston and lighted by Joe Gordon pro
vide striking backgrounds for the
action of the comic drama, songs for
which have been written by some
of the best-known student musi
cians on the campus. Chorus work
in this production, as in the "Foot
ball Gaieties," is under the direc
tion of Terry Brickley, widely
known for his work in exhibition
tap dancing.
Joe Thompson and Harry Lee
Logan, comedians, both of whom arc
well known for their laugh-pro
ducing antics, promise to steal part
of the thunder from the leading
roles, played by Helen Sue Eyster
and John Skinner. Specialty acts,
including men's and women's trios
and dancing numbers, appear in the
last scene of the show, which is cli
maxed with the stirring rhythm of
the "Loyalty Song" finale of the
opera.
The few seats still available may
be purchased today at the A.S.S.U.
offices. Helvenston announced last
night that there will be a closed re
hearsal for principals of Act 2 at
4 o'clock today in the Assembly Hall
and a full rehearsal of both acts at
7 o'clock.
