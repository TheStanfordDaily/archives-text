I ho I nivcrsity of (California is in the athletic doghouse
because control of the sports program is vested in the stu-s
dents. Such is the opinion of one l\(C. alumnus, as reported
in a San Francisco newspaper, and it raises an interesting!
pointâ€”one that will not he decided until (lie universities j
face squarely the question of whether or not present day
college athletics constitute big business.
At California, Ihc alumnus points out, athletics are in
the hands o{ an executive committee of eleven, nine of
whom are undergraduate students. He contrasts lliis with j
the Stanford board of control, composed of three faculty,
three alumni, and three student members, and declares
that the shifting personnel of the Hear group makes "any
continuity of program" impossible, whereas two-thirds of
the Stanford board members hold their posts over a period
of years and have experience in the matters at hand.
1 here is more than a little truth in what the I .(C. aluni-j
nus says, but it is beside the real point. 11 (California wants j
winning teams, it must procure coaches of the first rank 1
in their respective sports. The class of competition in the!
Pacific (Coast (Conference is too fast for results to be other
wise. And coaches of the first rank cannot be procured
unless they are offered good salaries. In short, how much
is (California willing to pay its coaches?
(College sports are recognized as big business by nearly
(very large university in the country. (California's alumni
and student body are screaming for winners. Will those
in charge loosen the purse-strings, or will they continue to
maintain "sports for sport's sake"?
