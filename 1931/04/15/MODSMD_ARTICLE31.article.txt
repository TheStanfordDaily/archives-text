# LET THE DEAD SLEEP
## 
### 
A Now York doctor lias seen fil, for no reason whatso
ever, to make public the contents of two letters written by
the late Pi â€¢esident Warren G. Harding when he was an
Ohio Senator, in which Harding expressed concern for a
friend who was "under the eye of Government agents" as
a German informer.
The late President has been the target of enough at
tacks, justified and otherwise, since bis death, and the lexl
of these most recent letters reveal that there is nothing to
warrant their being made public, other than the very ob
vious desire of the doctor to get bis name in tbe papers.
