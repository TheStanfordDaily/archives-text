# WHAT IS A UNIVERSITY?
## 
### 
If is commonly said that the purpose of a university is
to educate its students. To educate does not mean to drive
in, but to draw out. Education is a process of development,
and development is only by individual effort. The student
educates himself.
Since education is a matter of individual effort, the
purpose of a university is not to educate its students. Its
purpose lies in the fact that the student, left lo himself,!
does not know how to develop his mind and is not inter- 1
ested in intellectual effort, lie does not know how to de
velop his mind because be never has done so, and be is not
interested because the easiest activities are physical ones:
thought conies hard.
The purpose of a university is twofold: to provide op
portunity for the student to educate himself and to guide
and inspire him in the effort. Of these, to inspire the stu
dent is tbe more important. Opportunity is everywhere,
and method can be acquired without great difliculty. but
the spirit of interest in the intellectual adventure is not
easily found.
One is reminded of a school in Scotland, a small .school,
but one that had for its master a man who was a real
teacher. From that school went out student after student
who made important contributions to tbe work of the
world. A school like that is a real university.
If is not to memorize the alphabet that a person comes
to a university. Facts be can get anywhere. If is to be
inspired with a love for intellectual effort and for truth,
with a vision of problems to be solved, and with a determi
nation to plav one's part well. This is the purpose of a
university. The Minnesota Daily.

minutes of each class hour during lasf week singing Cali
fornia songs. Tills week they can occupy their time singing
