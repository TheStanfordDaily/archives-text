Personally, wo have nothing I
against junior colleges. They make !
excellent talking points for local I
chambers of commerce—they add to !
the civic beauty of the community j
—and they offer tv/o years of less ;
expensive diversion for those high- j
school students who do not wish to j
pass the time away at a university, j
Thus far, we feel that junior col
leges are serving a purpose in j
America, where everybody wants j
education, and where the present
depression prevents the ready em
ployment of high-school graduates.
But when it is proposed that the j
puny Lower Division be made still
more puny to make room for junior ;
college graduates—it is not only a !
horse of a different color, but it is a
different horse. It may be true that J
these transfers can write as com- i
plele examinations as the hitjh- j
school products, but to base the sue- j
cess of an institution upon such j
flimsy grounds would only be satis- |
lying to an individual who thinks j
that charts, tables, and curves are j
manifestations of some divine truth, j
In the first place, the junior col- ;
lege is just a two-year delay in the j
student's becoming acclimated to \
university methods and university
life. Most junior colleges seem to be
mechanical mixtures of high-schooi
methods and College Humor coile
gianism. Men leaving junior colleges |
have learned to smoke pipes, wear
cords, and in other ecyaally import
ant ways, manifest their post-high
school ego. The man attending a !
regular college has had two years 1

in which to drop the rah rahism of
the College Comedies; while the
transfer must begin his shedding of
false ideas in his junior year.
Then there is more to a university
than its library and its "blue books."
The student who enters in his jun
ior year (unless he is a most plastic
soul) is artificially grafted on the
university tree rather than being a
native sap among saps and feeling
the genuine school spirit. The man
who fails to live in Encina loses
something of intrinsic worth at
Stanford. The transfer rarely can
feel the democracy of the Farm.
Then very often the transfer i'eels
like a fifth wheel —or the visiting
president in a good-will assembly—
or any other object that doesn't seem
necessary. He does not or perhaps
he cannot enter into the extra-cur
ricular activities of the school. He
finds positions filled, and it is diffi
cult for him to break in.
It is true that many educators
want junior colleges. It appeals to
their love for unity. We have a jun
ior high school between grammar
and high school. It would seem in
evitable to balance Ihe educational
system that we should have a junior
college between high school and the
university. The educators may be
able to produce reams of statistics—
they may be able to write many
theses proving that the junior col
lege is this and that, but they never
can deny the '"psychological" handi
cap of having to uproot oneself in
the middle of a college career to com
plete work ekewhere.
