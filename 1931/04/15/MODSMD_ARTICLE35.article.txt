THE OWL IN THE ATTIC. By
James Thnrber. Harper & Broth
ers, 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
The author of that recent and im
portant contribution to the field of
S.A. investigation, "Is Sex Neces
sary?," has de-rusted the trusty
typewriter to further amuse and
mystify his faithful public with his
subtle humor and his long and in
volved sentences —like this one.
The dust-cover blurb, with its
usual aptness, remarks that the
book, like "all of Gaul," is divided
into three parts. The first concerns
humorous and wistful incidents in
the lives of an average and ordinary

man-and-wife, "little Mr. and Mrs.
Monroe." The husband, "with no
character but a certain charm," may
awaken many a personal remini
scence in the mind of most male
readers.
The section, concerning pets and
their idiosyncracies, is by far the
best in the book, with the iron lawn
dog and the moose with loose horns
rating high amongst the chuckle
getters.
The book does not achieve the
high point set by his former work
on sex, but it is still far above the
average humor. "Is Sex Necessary?,"
by the way, has just appeared in
the dollar edition which should be
welcome news to those who read,
desired, but could not afford.
—S.C.A.
