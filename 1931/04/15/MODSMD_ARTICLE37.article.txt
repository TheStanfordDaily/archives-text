Treating timely topics and re- |
vealing laughable seci*ets about the j
spring quarter existence of the
Stanfordites, the Silver Anniversary j
issue of the Chaparral will appear 1
on .the campus tomorrow.
Scribes who will discuss rushing, !
baseball, track, and other spring di- ,
versitios, include Nelson Carter, |
Paul Lorton, Burnell Gould, Jack j
Keerl, Larry Harris, Joe Thompson, ;
Dick Amyx, Bernard Bates, Bob j

One of the features will be a yarn
by Churchill and Walters on rush

bores.
"It will be one of our best issues," j

last night.
