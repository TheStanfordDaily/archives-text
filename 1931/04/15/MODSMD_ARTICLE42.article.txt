ROME, Apr. 14.—Another colossal
bombardment of the earth from
outer space has just been revealed.
Three great meteors, falling in Bra
zil, fired and depopulated hundreds
of miles of jungle. News of this
catastrophe has only now reached
civilization because the meteors fell
in the remote South American wil
derness.
It was yet another lucky escape of
mankind from an appalling and un
realizing period. The last great me
teor fell in Siberia in 1908, in a
district so remote that only last year
were details of its destruction given
to the world. Had either of these
two meteor falls chanced to strike a
city in a densely populated country,
frightful loss of life and damage
would have been caused.
Pirates attacked the steamer
Tuckwo, near Chinkiang, and seized
400 pounds of opium aboard the
vessel.
