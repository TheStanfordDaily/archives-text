To date, the foxy Trojan coach
has won his meets easily, with
out showing the Indian chief
where he keeps all his points.
Saturday he will have to take
them out of the bag for the
world to view if he expects to
beat L.A.A.C., while Templeton
can keep a lot of things in the
dark and still slaughter the
Golden Bear here in what is
laughingly referred to as "the
Big Meet."

not want to win from the club
