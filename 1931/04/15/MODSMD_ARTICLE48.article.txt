# Brown, Wright Lower Own Marks in Mile, 880
## DISTANCE IN IN LAST TIME TRIALS BEFORE BIG MEET Eastman May Enter Three Events Against Bear Squad Saturday 
### Lowell Cox 
; in me iusi strenuous woncout for
{the distance men before the Cali
| fornia meet Saturday, two Stanford
i runners yesterday set new records
j for themselves.
I Bob Brown did the mile in the
excellent time of 4:24.4, while Wright
I negotiated the half-mile in 1:57.2.
While Brown finished strong, coin
petition might have forced him to
an even lower mark, and his chances
for a win Saturday over Spud
! Mossman, Bear captain, appear good.
I As for the U.S.C. meet, the Indian
four-lapper may not be able to beat
out Halstead, but he should at least
trail him closely.
Might Beat Zcllman
Wright's feat, while not startling
: after Ben Eastman's performance of
| 7:52.G, nevertheless indicates that he
| not only has a chance to beat Zell
: man Saturday, but that he might
I nose out McGeah of U.S.C,
McGeah only did 1:57 in the Tro
! Jan-Bear meet last week. Eastman
I is of course slated for first in the
I two-lap event, but a second by
| Wright would add some unexpected
points.,
Fullenwider, who ran the trial
with Wright yesterday, trailed by
about six yards after making a de
termined bid to take the lead on
the final backstretch.
In the only other time trial for
the day, Podge Smith broke the tape
I in the 220-yard low hurdles in :25.1.
While this time was only fair, he
had a stiff breeze to contend with.
Herbert, Nisbet Chosen
The feature of the hurdle skirmish
was that Herbert, who finished sec
; ond, and Nisbet, whom he just
i "picked," were chosen to run with
Smith against California, Gordon
trailing behind the trio.
One of the most interesting ques
tions Saturday centers around Ben
! Eastman. The blond sophomore is
slated to run his accustomed 440-
j yard and relay events, but there is
a chance that Templeton might try
j him in the half.
While a win in the 880 will have
little effect on the final result of the
California meet, a rumor is current
: (hat Dink may run Eastman in all
■ three events to see if he can make
the grade, every point being needed
,in the U.S.C. engagement.
