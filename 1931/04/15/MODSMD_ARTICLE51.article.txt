# SOCCER MEN LOOK PROMISING IN FIRST WORKOUT DESPITE LOSS OF REGULARS
## 
### JACK PEAT 
With the prospect of losing all but J
two of the men who represented (
Stanford against California in soccer I
last fall, Coach Harry Maloney could i
still feel optimistic about the com- i
ing season as he watched his squad |
in their first spring practice Mon- J
day. Over 49 men were out in uni- j
form, and the turnout brought back .
many of the old reliables together i
with much good material from the j
freshman team.
Buster Holmes, a former Stan
ford fullback, and one of the best,
according to Maloney, is back in |
school this year after a long absence.
This will be his last season of com
petition, but Holmes, along with
Plumb, Falk, and Webster, who are

in the same predicament, are all set
to put the finishing touches on their
game, so that we can expect plenty
of good soccer from them this fall.
Maloney expects an even larger
turnout next Monday, when several
men who are now busy with other
sports will be free to devote their
time to soccer. One of these, Arthur
Hearne, an excellent center forward
from the freshman team, will be a
valuable addition to the varsity for
ward line, as as the baseball
season is over. Melvin Nicoll and
Bill Meams, at present engaged with
football and track respectively, will
both be in uniform next week. They
are expected to put up strong battles
for the center half and outside right
positions.
