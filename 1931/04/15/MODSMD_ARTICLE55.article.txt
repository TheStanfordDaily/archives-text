# INDIAN NETMEN DOPED TO WIN AGAINST BEARS
## Two Teams End Undefeated Season In Matches Here Saturday 
### 
Crossing racquets with the Golden
Bear outfit here Saturday for the
championship of the southern divi
sion of the Pacific Coast Conference,
' the varsity netmen are expecting to
add a final victory to their clean
j season record. If nothing goes wrong,
the local team should have no trou-
I ble in carrying off a 7-2 win or
better.
Both teams will culminate an un
defeated season with Saturday's
1 matches. The Bears have gone
through no less than 14 successful
, meets this year, chalking up a vic
tory in each one. Besides taking all
four encounters with U.C.L.A. and
| U.S.C., they have conquered St.
' Mary's twice, San Francisco Univer
sity twice, San Jose State. College of
j the Pacific, Sacramento J.C., San
i Mateo J.C., Menlo J.C., and Modesto
1 J.C.
Whereas California is almost sure
to furnish more competition than
either the Bruins or U.S.C., Easton's
classy squad is practically as cer
tain to cinch the division honors and
the right to play the northern divi
j sion champions.
Definite announcement of the
line-up has not been made, and the
J only tilt which is certain at the pres
j ent time is the feature match, Keith
Gledhill vs. Captain Allan Blade.
From all indications, Gledhill should
have no trouble defeating the Bear
I captain.
, Blade has lost, this season, to El
bert Lewis, number one man for
U.C.L.A. and Pacific Coast champion,
whereas Gledhill took Lewis twice
in straight sets. Furthermore, Blade
â–  and Jack DeLara, U.S.C. champion,
' divided their two matches of the
(season one each. Since Gledhill also
i downed DeLara twice in straight
| sets, he is highly favored to cop the
feature tilt.
