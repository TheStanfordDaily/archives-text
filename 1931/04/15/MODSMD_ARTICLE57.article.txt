# BASEBALL WIN SATURDAY WILL BREAK RECORD
## Practice Concentrated On Pitchers; Caddel And Reide Look Good 
### 
After extensive research in the
musty files of Stanford athletic rec
ords, it was found yesterday that not
since the second year of Stanford-
California hoistililies on the dia
mond, 1893 to be exact, has the Farm
been able to enjoy three straight
baseball victories over the Bears.
With this rather dismal record in
mind, it would be doubly gratifying
il Captain Hunken could lead the
Indians to a third victory over the
Blue and Gold on Saturday. Another
factor which would make a victory
over the Bears especially beneficial
to Farm baseball is the size of the
crowd expected to attend ihe game
with many alumni to "be shown."
Because of the hard work he has
been doing all season, Hal Riede will
probably start against U.C.L.A. on
Friday. Reide, by dint of continual
practice, has been gradually im
proving and should be able to keep
the Bruins within bounds.
Practice this week is being con
centrated upon the work of the
pitchers, on whose shoulders Indian
pennant chances rest. Caddel, as
well as Riede, is showing up well
and should be in good form by Fri
day.
U.C.L.A. is now making its an
nual invasion of the Northland on
Monday suffered a defeat at the
hands of the fast-improving Broncos
of Santa Clara. With a pitching staff
as weak as the Bruins have, this
week's games should be hard on the
team.
