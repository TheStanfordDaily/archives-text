### 
BUENOS AIRES, Apr. 14 (Jf).—
A governmental crisis appeared to
be brewing in the Argentine today.
It was understood in usually re
liable quarters that five of eight
members of President Uriburu's
cabinet would resign either today
or tomorrow. The president, to fill
out his ministry, probably will seek
a concentration of all elements op
posed to the radicals, who, ousted
by revolution last year, staged a
comeback a week ago and are in
the lead in counting in the recent
Buenos Aires provincial elections
held then.
The ministers formally notified the
president of their decision shortly
after his return yesterday from
Santa Fe where Saturday he said
in a speech that means would be
taken to prevent the radicals com
ing back into power.
