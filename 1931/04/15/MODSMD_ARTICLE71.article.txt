BANGOR, Maine, April 14. (/P) â€”
The value of aviation in the map
making field has been demonstrated
around here.
A pilot and non-commissioned of
ficer, using a military observation
plane, mapped 4.400 square miles of
almost impenetrable and hitherto
uncharted woodlands in east cen
tral Maine in six months.
It was said that under the old
fashioned system of ground survey
ing with a sextant the task would
have consumed several years.
