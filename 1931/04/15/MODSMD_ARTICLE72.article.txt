# ANTI-PROHIBITION MEASURES LISTED BY WOMAN HEAD
## Mrs. Charles Sabin Reports Before Organization In New York 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 14. (/P) —
Four findings of sentiment against
prohibition—among them the Wick
ersham report—were listed today by
Mrs. Charles H. Sabin of New York
before the second meeting of the
women's organization for national
prohibition reform.
The law enforcement commis
sioners' separate reports Mrs. Sabin
termed a document that "should be
adopted as the handbook of the anti
prohibitionists."
She named as other indicators of
opposition to the eighteenth amend
ment: "increase in our own mem
bership"; "change in the complexion
of congress"; and "refusal of more
and more of the states to spend
money and effort for the enforce
ment of a law repugnant to their
peoplfc."
As Mrs. Jesse W. Nicholson had
called upon the National Woman's
Law Enforcement League to sup
port prohibition above their party,
Mrs. Sabin demanded that "patriot
ism shall be placed above party."
