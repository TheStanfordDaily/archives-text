### 
LOS ANGELES. Apr. 14 </P>. —
Prediction that the Democratic party
would win the next presidency,
made by Chairman Jouett Shouse of
the Democratic national executive |
committee, resounded through Cali- i
fornia today.
This statement, and a general re- '
nunciation of the Republican admin- 1
istration were the highlights of '
Shouse's address here last night at !
a Jefferson Day dinner.
"For more than two years," |
Shouse said, "the government of the I
United States has simply drifted. A '
harassed and indignant nation is
preparing, if I read the auguries cor- 1
rectly, to rid itself of the most inept, j
inadequate and incompetent admin
istration that fate has brought to;
Washington in at least two decades. I
"We have never had action where j
postponement was possible. We i
have had avoidance of responsibility 1
when leadership was poignantly re- i
quired. Not only has nothing been'
done, but we have not even had any
statement of policy or principle that
was not so hedged about with quali
iications and so obscured by eva
sions that nobody could clearly read
its meaning."
BERLIN, April 14. (/P)—There are
39 women members of the reichstag !
now. The latest is Frau Selam
Lohse, city counsel of Wuersburg,
who is in the seat of the late Her
mann Mueller, once chancellor.
