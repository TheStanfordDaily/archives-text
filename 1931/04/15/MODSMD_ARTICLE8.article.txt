# JAPAN OPPOSES MINORITY RULE
## Proletarian Ideals Shown In Ichihashi Talk 
### 
Recent social developments in Ja
pan have not followed any clearly
developed path, because of conflict
ing thoughts and ideas, according to
Professor Yamato Ichihashi, who,
speaking in the Little Theatre last
night, briefly sketched contemporary
Japanese social conditions.
"The culturistic movement has be
come very powei'ful since the World
War. The culturists are dissatisfied
with the present order of things,"
said Professor Ichihashi. "They are
unconditionally opposed to the mi
nority control of society as a whole,
to money and power, to aristocratic
expression in literature and art.
They have created a proletarian lit
erature, the main theme of which is
social problems in the broadest
meaning. Proletarian literature has
practically predominated in the
leading magazines of Japan for more
than a decade. Magazines which do
not print such articles find no mar
ket in Japan."
One of the most radical attempts
in Japan is the establishment of
communistic villages, where every
one labors by hand and shares in
common, according to the speaker.
Professor Ichihashi pointed out
the rapid progress of Japan in gov
ernment, politics, foreign trade, and
education. "Progress in education is
shown by the fact that Japan has
no illiteracy to speak of now," he
said. Books are cheap and book
shops numerous." Nowhere are there
more reading maniacs than in Ja
pan," he commented.
Political and industrial situations
have broken up the institution of
the family. Women, formerly pre
eminently domestic and respected
only as wives and mothers, have
now invaded practically every voca
tion. Although they are compelled
to attend elementary schools, the
highest institutions open to them are
teachers' colleges.
