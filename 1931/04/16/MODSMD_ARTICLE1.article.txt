MARSEILLES, France, April 15.
(/V) —The Havas Agency reported
tonight that Alfonso XIII would
reach here between midnight and
1 a.m. (2 p.m. P.C.T.) aboard the
Spanish cruiser Principe Alfonso, in
which he sailed from Cartagena last
night. The port authorities said they
had not been notified of the im
pending arrival, and in any case the
cruiser could not enter the harbor
until morning, but would have to
anchor in the roads.
MADRID, April 15, (/P)—The Re
publican Government of Spain, new
and untried, closed its first day of
power with a manifesto laying down
the rights of the people and an
nouncing its intention to call a con
stitutional parliament.
Signed by Provisional President
Niceto Alcala Zamora and his min
isters, the decree pledged respect
for personal property, religious
freedom and public assembly, guar
anteed a new agrarian policy to aid
the farmer and promised to turn
over its power to a permanent gov
ernment whenever formed.
Ministry Confers
The new ministry conferred
throughout the day on their tre
mendous task of converting a weak
ened monarchy into a stable repub
lic. It was announced decrees would
be passed abolishing all titles of
nobility and dissolviiffe the status of
life members of the senate, ap
pointed by the retired monarch.
The government's tentative plan
is to hold parliamentary elections at
some date not yet decided, allow
the Parliament as a constitutional
convention to write the permanent
constitution and then either by di
rect vote of the' people or by the
action of Parliament name a con
stitutional cabinet to replace the
present "provisional government."
Problems Undecided
What to do about the Catalan Re
public and the movement in Bilbao
for a Basque state is not decided.
These two theoretical republics are
r unetioning so far as a part of Spain.
Whether they will establish them
.elves literally as independent re
publics among the world's nations or
A'hile calling themselves republics
eally operate as autonomous states
.vithin Spain remains to be seen.
The cabinet has decreed it has the
tower to make any government of
ice appointments it deems necessary
vithout outside intervention until a
jarliament is elected and drafts a
lefinite plan for the future.
