# Water Carnival Is Junior Week Event On May 1
## Encina Pool Or Searsville Lake To Be Scene 
### 
With the surprise announcement
that the traditional water sports car
nival will after all be a pai't of the
festivities, Ed Boyles, class president,
yestei'day officially set May 1 as the
date for the annual Junior Class
week-end.
Charlie Carl, director of the carni
val, is making arrangements to get
either the Encina gymnasium pools
or Searsville Lake for the program.
Events will include fancy diving ex
hibitions, races and a variety of
comic water stunts.
Because the Junior Opera is be
ing produced early this year, hence
relegating the class activities to dif
ferent week-ends, members of the
committee in charge are making
tentative plans to hold a picnic.
Definite announcements of this pic
nic will be made later, Boyles an
nounced.
Under the direction of Beverly
Robinson, general chairman of the
Prom, final decision has been made
concerning programs and decora
tions for the dance. White leather
booklets with an appliqued color ef
fect of pastel shades were chosen
as the most attractive programs. The
feature of each program will be the
dancing couple silhouetted in the
lower right corner.
