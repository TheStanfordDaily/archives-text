# HONDURAS CITY LOOTED: 9 U.S. CITIZENS DEAD
## Marines Land To Protect Americans Attacked By Insurgents 
### 
PUERTO CABEZAS, Nicaragua,
April 15 â€”Word reached here
that a band of insurgents splitting
from the main body which has been
operating inland captured Cape Gra
cias a Dios, just south of the Hon
duran border, at 2 a.m. today.
Today United States marines land
ed from the U.S.S. Asheville to pro
tect the citizens of this port.
Refugees from the sector where
nine Americans were killed Satur
day reported that the insurgents
suddenly appeared at Logtown at
about 7 a.m., barely giving the com
missary clerk the time to call the
Wawa Junction telephone exchange.
He shouted "Help" into the mouth
piece and ran, leaving the receiver
down.
Hears Bandits Work
The Wawa operator, as a conse
quence, was able to hear the bandits
as they looted the Logtown com
missary and notified Puerto Cabezas
and other encampments in the vi
cinity.
An automobile carrying William
Selser, "Pinkie" Wilson, and Arthur
Curtis, Americans, took a marine
and four of the guardia toward the
lumber camp, but stopped some dis
tance away to await Captain Har
len Pefley and four more of the
Guardia.
When they were near the place
the insurgents, who had prepared
an ambush, opened fire from behind,
killing Captain Pefley and wounding
a guardia and Selser, who died later.
A fight followed and after a while
the insurgents withdrew.
Rebels Tap Wires
The insurgents tapped the wires
and were listening to the appeal for
help, so that when Lieutenant Clyde
Roy Rarrah, Ralph Beardsley, and
twenty men from Puerto Cabezas
approached they found another am
bush. They fought their way out.
Marine corps planes bombed the
insurgents Sunday morning. Rein
forcements under Captain J. C.
Wood and Lieutenant Simmer joined
the guard Monday morning and en
gaged the insurgents in a battle,
killing eight of them, including the
high Sandino leader, Pedro Blandon.
