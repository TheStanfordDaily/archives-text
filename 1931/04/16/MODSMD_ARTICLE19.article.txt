# ALUMNI MAY VISIT DR. JORDAN'S HOME ON UNIVERSITY DAY
## 
### 
With a hope that the Chancellor
Emeritus will be well enough to
acknowledge a greeting, the alumni
committee for University Day has
listed a pilgrimage to Dr. Jordan's
home as one of the highlights on the
program for next Saturday.
All of the graduates who return
for the day will congregate, if the
idea goes through, in front of the
Administration building about 11:30
in the morning and go over in a
body. It is hoped that Dr. Jordan
will either appear in the garden or
at a window and perhaps have a
few words to say to his former stu
dents.
Dr. Jordan has always been an
advocate of the custom of University
Day, and would be willing to do his
share in the program this year, if
his health and physicians permit.
