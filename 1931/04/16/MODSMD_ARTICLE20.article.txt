YPSILANTI, Mich., April 15. (TP)
â€”Co-eds at Michigan State Normal
College may smoke if they wish, but
if they're caught they may as well
give up hope of teaching careers,
says Charles McKenny, president of
the school.
"I'm not looking on smoking as a
moral problem hut as a common
sense social problem,'' McKenny
said. "The girls here arc preparing
to teach and Michigan doesn't want
teachers who smoke" When these
girls finish school they expect us to
recommend them for position. A
great many schools in Michigan will
not employ smoking teachers. If
these girls smoke and we know it,
we'll tell the truth about them when
asked."
