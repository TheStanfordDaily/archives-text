# VERSE CHOIR IN NOVEL RECITAL
## Large Audience Applauds Original Style 
### Ellamac Dodds 
Well known and popular poetical
works were last night given a new !
meaning and original interpretation
by recitation in unison and action I
by the San Jose State College Verse
Speaking Choir, in their program
presented in the Women's Club
house.
The unusualness of such a pro- ■
gram combined with the excellence
of its presentation won much de
served applause from the large au
dience. Numbers worthy of special
commendation were the "Congo" by !
Vachel Lindsay, in which the choir
was successful in creating a weird
moaning effect; "Jazz Fantasia" by I
Carl Sandburg, a»crooning imitation
of the saxophone and other popular
jazz instruments; "Boots" by Kip- i
ling, portraying effectively the mo- 1
notony and maddening effect of the
constantly recurring pound of boots; I
and "The House that Jack Built," a
cleverly humorous interpretation of j
the famous child's poem.
Special numbers by small groups
and individual members of the choir
were also appreciated, and violin
solos by the head of the music de
partment of San Jose State added
variety to the program.
The choir was especially interest
ing in that it is the first one of such
type to be organized in the state, j
Their presentation was under the
auspices of the Stanford Y.W.C.A.,
which realized a profit of $55 on the j
program.
