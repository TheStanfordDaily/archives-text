# STANFORD TO HOLD RADIO DEBATE WITH ST. MARY'S TONIGHT
## 
### 
Isador Botasof will represent
Stanford in a debate with St. Mary's
College over radio station KROW
at 10 o'clock this evening on the
subject, "Resolved, That all distinc
tion between amateurs and profes
sionals should be abolished in sports
to which admission fees are
charged."
There will be only one speaker
from each institution in this non
decision debate. Botasof, one of the
most experienced speakers on the
Stanford squad, was recently taught
by a radio announcer how to talk
over the microphone.
The debate is the result of a chal
lenge by the St. Mary's authorities a
few weeks ago. The Stanford De
bate Council accepted the challenge,
and Botasof was selected by Profes
sor J. G. Emerson, head debating
coach.
