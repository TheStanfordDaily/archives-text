Somewhere, somehow, tlie schedule - makers have I
missed one. More than a year after the home-and-home i
agreement between Stanford and Dartmouth had been;
consummated comes the discovery that Harvard Stadium
will not be available for I he second gridiron clash with the
easterners on November 2<S of this year.
Permission for use of the stadium, which must be ob-j
tained from the mayor of Boston, was refused yesterday
on the ground that the Boston College-Holy Cross game,!
a traditional battle waged annually on the Thanksgiving
week-end, had prior rights to the. stadium.
So now the Dartmouth authorities must scout around
for a stadium in which to stage the battle. Chicago and
Philadelphia have already been suggested, not exactly the;
most suitable sites for a game between a team from New;
Hampshire and one from California.
