# "VIVA ESPANA!"
## 
### 
Yesterday Alfonso XIII, for II years king of Spain, ab
dicated his throne, cried "Viva Espana," and sailed away
trom the country whose sovereign he had been since the
day of his birth. The "last" of the Bourbons was a monarch
no more.
Xews reports say that Alfonso was grimly stoical as he
boarded the ship at Cartagena that carried him awav from
the Spain he had ruled and loved. He had a right to be
stoical. Forty-four years is a long lime to be a sovereign,
long enough for most of the pleasures of kingship to have
been enjoyed and most of the distasteful things about rul
ing to have been experienced. Apparently he is through as
; monarch.
And it's possible that lie's pretty glad to have turned in
his resignation, lie tried dictators and premiers, monarch
ists and now republicans. None of them were very restful
associates for a king of Spain. So perhaps he has again
proved himself "one of the most astute politicians in Eu
rope" by quitting, and with his dignity.
