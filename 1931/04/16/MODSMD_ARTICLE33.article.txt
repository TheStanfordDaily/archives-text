# THEY DO THEIR JOB

### 
Stanford has al least one organization which is not
struggling to make the campus feel it is the answer to some
long-fell need. It is not working to gel members or to write
a constitution. Long ago it made a place for itself on the
campus and proved its right to exist. Of course, it's the
Stanford Hand.
Campus skeptics who think the hand doesn't work
might well look at its schedule for Saturday, University
Day. From 11 to 12 o'clock in the morning, the hand will
plav at the Kaffee Klatsch in the women's new gymnasium.
Beginning at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, it will play at
the track meet, leaving there at i o'clock for the I'nion
Court where the hand will present its annual concert for
the alumni.
At one time Inst winter hand members thought they
could not go on. Klbows were coming out of the red coats,
and money was not available for new ones. Even music
(ould not be bought. The band's financial support has al
ways consisted in optional donations from the alumni and
the Hoard of Athletic Control. Seldom have these been
enough to meet the band's needs. But Stanford's band has
continued to play, this year, especially, in its ragged uni
forms, and perhaps, it present plans are completed, it will
receive the backing it deserves. •
