## 
### 
The I'nitod States Supremo Court ruled this week Iluil
hotel owners who furnish their quests radio sots must ob
tain permission from copyright owners to tune in on copy
right music. The reasoning of the court was: "There is no
difference in substance between Iho case where a hotel
engages an orchestra lo furnish music and that whore*by
means of the radio sol and loud speakers hero employed
it furnishes the same music for the same purpose. In each
the music is produced by instrumentalities under its con
trol."
The Duly, enjoying protection of the copvrigl»f laws
of the United States, believes that those who create are
entitled to a just return on the use of their creations; Ihe
Daily would bo the last lo attack the principle of copyright
protection. Hut in Iho present decision, copyright protec
tion has boon carried too far.
Legally, the supreme court's decision may bo valid; it
will have to bo so accepted. Hut the extending of the pro
tection of copyright to music after ii has boon released
broadcast over the air docs not seem justified. When the
copyright owner has boon paid his foe bv the broadcaster,
his claim should cease. When the radio waves speed the
music far and wide, that broadcast should be considered as
subject to Ihe free enjoyment ol anyone who tunes in,
whether he listens over his own sot, or whether ho rents a
sot, or whether he happens to be staying in a hotel room
furnished with a hotel-owned radio set.
