# BULL SESSION

### 
It is often claimed that the good
things in life come in small pack
ages. That is perhaps why the most
interesting and revealing bit of re
! cent news was a two-inch article 10
the effect that a commander of some
! American Legion post in some un
pronounceable New Mexico town
would request President Hoover to
pardon ex-Secretary of the Interior
Albert B. Fall. Mr. Fall is well re
membered as the man recently con
victed of bribery.
Another ex-Legion officer makes
the naive statement that Albert Fall
never quit the American Legion
when he was a man of power in
Washington and the Legion will not
quit him in his adversity. Such
statements make one wonder, in
deed, if Boston and New York arc
not correct in feeling that the West
is just one short step past its wild-
Indian, two-gun, boot-on-the-bar
days.
It's probably good cowboy eti
quette to stick by old "AI" like A1
stuck by you; but even the admir
able quality of loyalty has its limit.
Here is Albert Fall who stands con
-1 victed of what amounts to "selling
his government"—the Legion's gov
ernment if you will—for $100,000.
Not only did he break his oath—but
he ruined one President—implicated
many people of note—embarrassed
a national party (as much as a party
can be embarrassed) —and raised a
stench that reached to high heaven.
We can forgive Jean Val Jean for
stealing a measly loaf of bread for
a brood of starving children; but
when a man like Fall steals, so to

LEGION FALLS FOR FALL

speak, for chocolate eclairs, our
sympathy becomes about as potent
as weak coffee.
The fact that Mr. Fall received his
$100,000 has ceased to be provoking,
j but that these patriots of the Legion
I who love and who fought for the
| grand old U.S.A. should feel that
j this man who robbed their country
' should be pardoned, passes ordinary
! comprehension. Our nations is so
I rich and its money seems so end
j less that the citizen is apt to laugh
j at such matters as the Fall oil-lease
j episode—in fact many seem to wish
j they had had their own snoots in
j the public trough to get theirs while
• the getting was good.
The argument commonly heard
j that others were involved besides
' Fall—and that all kinds of "steals"
\go on in the government may or
I may not be true. We do know that
! after the red tape was cleared away,
IFall was found guilty. That he
' should pay his penalty not only for
| his own actions but as an example
j lor others that seem to feel that the
! government owes them a living, and.
i who would like to treat the U.S.
' treasury as a communistic enter
: prise for a selected few—seems jus
j tified.
From the practical . viewpoint,
' there is little possibility of such a
j pardon. Herbert Hoover has more
I political sense than to reopen the
I Fall-Sinclair mess and give hungry
Democrats more red meat to feast
j upon. It is gratifying that if the plea
| did come, it came from some un
i pronounceable spot in the Great
! American Desert.
