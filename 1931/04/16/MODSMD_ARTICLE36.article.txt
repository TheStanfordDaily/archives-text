THREE PAIRS OF SILK STOCK
INGS. By Panteleimon Romanoff.
Charles Scribncr's Sons, 1931. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"Three Pairs of Silk Stockings"
gives a typically Russian picture of
a new phase of life under the Soviet
regime, that of members of the for
mer intelligentsia trying to adjust
themselves to a lower level of life.
A good five-unit course on how to
unravel the difficulties and frequent
changes of Russian nomenclature
would be an unquestioned blessing
to all those pervert enough to wish
to read Russian novels as a regular
thing. In reading this book one is
likely to become hopelessly lost in
a morass of bewildering names and
to lose the thread of the story won
dering just who Sergey Ivanovitch
was in the last chapter and under
what name he will appear in the
next. The book is too long drawn
out and repeats itself too often and
the title is not explained until the
very end when it is shown that so
low have Russian morals fallen that
any woman can be bought there for
three pairs of silk stockings.

JULIO JURENITO. By Ilya Ehren
hourg. Covici-Fricde, New York,
1931. (At the Palo Alio Book
Shop.)
Seven disciples followed the Mas
ter over the world, upholding their
belief that nothing exists, seeking
examples to further their creed.
Each had suffered disillusionment,
despair.
"Julio Jurenito" gives a glimpse
of a veritable Coxey or Candide.
Thoroughly satirical, it amuses, an
noys, confuses, and does anything
but advise one to bask in the sun
shine of a good old world.
Because Ehrenbourg is showing
his readers the chaotic state of their
present world, one does not know
whether he is right or not. Time is
necessary to allow us to view our
present period impersonally. Then,
perhaps, we can better appreciate
his accurate satire. —J.N.
STRANGERS MAY KISS—At the
Varsity Theatre.
After seeing "Strangers May Kiss,"
now unreeling at the Varsity, one
can but wonder what has happened
to the stories Norma Shearer's

[hubby, who presumably has things
Ito say about M-G-M affairs, used
!to purchase for his accomplished
wife.
Without doubt, J.his current flicker
' is the poorest Miss Shearer has ap
peared in since the advent of the
i talkies. After such masterpieces as
j "The Trial of Mary Dugan" and
j "The Last of Mrs. Cheney," any
, thing like "Strangers May Kiss" is
I rather hard to take.
Miss Shearer is ever the same
; charming, finished actress, but she
I cannot raise a story of this type to
! her usual level.
Bright dialogue, the perpetually
tight Robert Montgomery, and a few
I really good scenes save the produe
| tion from being completely dismal.

| FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN—
At the New Stanford Theatre.
| If fifty million Frenchmen were to
1 drop in to see this it would be a
record crowd and they would prob
! ably be insulted. It is possible that
Hollywood directors were born with
j a certain amount of intelligence but
■ the fact that they persist in making
whole productions in color hardly
indicates that.
The preliminary blurb stated that
I "joy would be unrefined" in this
: picture, but don't bank on seeing
ior hearing anything along Green
' Street lines. With the usual unlikely
j plot of musical comedies this one
; has occasional lines and situations
| which are undeniably funny. The
I shot of Olsen and Johnson, the two
' dumb Jflatfoots, modeling pilfered
j silk undergarments would make the
] dullest show worth sitting through
and this is by no means the dullest,
j William Gaxton makes a convinc
i ing hero and he and the very pre-
I sentable heroine manfully refrain
from singing sentimental theme
songs at each other and true love
1 wins in the end—a just reward for
; such unsual forbearance. —S.C.A.
