# FRENCH CLUB MEETS AT LUNCHEON TODAY
## 
### 
The French table will hold its
regular Thursday noon luncheon to
day in the Union dining room, under
the auspices of the Cercle Francais.
The table was organized, through
the efforts of Dr. William L.
Schwartz of the Romanic Languages
department, for the purpose of fur
nishing an opportunity for French
conversation to all students inter
ested in acquiring a speaking knowl
edge of the language.
Conversation throughout the meal
is conducted entirely in French.
Members of the French department
and foreign students, as well as men
and women studying the language,
are patrons of the table.
