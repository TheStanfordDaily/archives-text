MORE ABOUT THE JUNIOR COLLEGES

. The Editor, Sir:
The Bull Session has substantiated
I the editorial policy of the Stanford
; Daily in regard to the question of
! junior colleges.
I doubt if many of the critics of
| the junior college are familiar with
I the new educational plan into which
i the junior college and the junior
I high school are planned to fit.
This plan is called the 6-4-4 plan.
! Six years of a person's education
' will be spent in a grade school. The
next four (seventh and eignth
| grades, freshman and sophomore
i years in high school) will be ac
i quired in a junior high school. A
I junior college, with junior and sen
j ior years of high school, anfl fresn
, man and sophomore years of college
in the curriculum, will complete libâ€”
j eral education. Specialized education
| will be learned as at present in uni-
I versities.

One could agree that at present
the junior college transfer might
suffer a disadvantage in having to
adjust himself to a new environ
ment, but the present style of junior
college is not the eventual goal that
is being worked for, and for which
(he lower division at Stanford might
be dropped.
