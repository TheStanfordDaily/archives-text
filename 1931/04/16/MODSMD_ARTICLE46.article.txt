BEAR MEAT

The effects of Brick Morse's Col
imn of Humorous Predictions on
he Big Meet are beginning to show
1 the mental attitude of Bear ath
•tes, which is evidently "right"' (or
ripe"), depending upon your per
pective. Cast the orb upon these,
he sentiments of Spud Mossman,
California's "Iron Man" captain. Di
ect from Berkeley, they read like
lis:
''Regardless of the score last
Saturday, we were good for.">((
points against the Trojans, and
they are that much better than
Stanford. I think we can take
Stanford Saturday. We should
pile up a score of 69-62. It will
depend upon the team. If they
keep their heads up, we will
win the meet."
That statement is doubly remark
ble when compared with the pre
iction of Captain Podge Smith. The
idian leader believes that his team
as a very good chance of bettering
le record Big Meet score of 94 2-3
> 3(5 1-3, made in 1929.
Well, perhaps it is the duty of
val captains to appear optimistic,
tr. Mossman, in that case, should
2 congratulated upon doing his
uty well, even though it hurt,
nd it must, for he knows as well
i Walter Christie himself that his
am cannot, by any stretch of the
lagination, pile up more than 45
>ints. Even that is being liberal.
As things stand right now,
Templeton's boys should come
within about four points of that
all time record. They should
gather 14 in the dash events, 9
in the 140. 6 in the 880, 5 in the
mile, 3 in the two-mile, 9 in
the high hurdles, and 8 in the
lows. On the field, points in the
red should l)e 6 in the broad
jump, 4 in the high jump, 3 in
the pole vault', 3 in the javelin,
8 in the shot, 9 in the discus,
and 5 in the relay.
That would leave Dink's big red
am with 93 points, 1 1-3 short of
e record. The above layout could
justly disputed by anyone, pre
rably a Californian. A wearer of
e Blue and Gold, for instance,
mid give Spencer Sparks, sensa
>nal find that Christie uncovered
the beginning of the season, more
an four points in the century and
D.
Sparks has run a 9.7 hundred,
as well as something like a 21.3
fur|ong. Jlowever, in the past
(hose phenomenal times broad
cast from Berkeley early in the
season have failed to material
ize in the Big Meet. At any rate,
if Dyer is in condition Saturday,
Mr. Spovks wiii have to be con
tent with about third in the
hundred behind Hec and Les
Hables. He has a better chance
>[ breaking up this stellar com
bination for three points in the
>20.
;f Eastman runs in the 880 as well
in the 440 and the relay, Zellman
the Bears has no right to the
•ond we gave him behind Wright
the Indians. There is a rumor
rrent that Dink is going to run
; quarter-mile charhpion in all
ee events just to see if Ben can
nd the going. If he can, beware
ijans!
Mossman, the confident, had
ictter do a little worrying about
lis own events instead of wast
ng his time in Brick Morse's
•acket. He is evidently figuring
o take both the mile and the
wo-mile, though how he plans
o do so is beyond anyone who
tas seen Aebersold and Brown
•ome along this season. Last
ear the "Iron Man" turned the
rick with times of 4:28 and 9:51.
Phis year both of these marks
re too slow. He can probably
ake Aebersold in the eight-lap i
rind with something like 9:40,
•ut not after running a 4:23 mile
o beat Brown. Giving him eight
mints in the pair of races is
ilenty liberal. —Crawford.
