# Indian Nine Meets California, U.C.L.A. This Week
## FAST CONTESTS FORESEEN WITH INVADERS HERE Stanford Will Attempt To Make Clean Sweep Of California Series 
### 
Plenty of action is in store for the
' Stanford nine this week-end when
they take on the Bruins of U.C.L.A.
and the Bears of California on suc
: eessive days. The Bears, driven into
a frenzy by the two wounds to their
'hitherto unblemished series record
of the past five years, will be out
jfor blood on Saturday.
Should Clint Evans be able to
i figure out some mystic way of tam
ing the Indians he would at least be
! able to say that not since 1893 had
a Stanford team taken three straight
from the Berkeley ball-hawk.s.
Outside of pestilence, plague, and
I famine, nothing should prevent Dan
Johnson from starting on the mound
for his third California game. In
none of the games he has wofi this
I year has a team scored more than
two runs from him. Furthermore
j there is nothing to prove that Harry
Wolter's men cannot score more
1 than three runs against any confer
i ence team.
Tomorrow the Indians will tangle
with U.C.L.A., the only team which
has defeated Dan Johnson this sea
son. However, the Cards are hitting
i and fielding better than during the
: Southern trip, and, if given any kind
of pitching, should be able to score
| enough runs to win a ball game off
any Bruin pitcher.
The Redshirts' league standing
would be greatly improved by win-
I ning both games this week-end, as
it would give California five losses
and practically eliminate them from
! the race. Southern California has
four losses, which makes them a
| threatening factor at all times since
1 one Stanford loss would tie up the
' league leadership.
Yesterday's practice was marked
by the heavy hitting of the Cards'
"big four"—Dclmas, Rintala, Philip-
I pi, and Johnson. Vince Philippi
J seems to have completely regained
his batting eye.
