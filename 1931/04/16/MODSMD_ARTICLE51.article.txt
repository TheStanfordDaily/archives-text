# TEMPLETON MAY RUN LES HABLES AND EASTMAN IN THREE EVENTS SATURDAY
## 
### 
Ben Eastman and Les Hables, per-
I haps Stanford's two greatest run
; ners, may each run three races
against California next Saturday,
j according to* Coach Dink Templeton.
Dink wants to find out once and
I for all whether Eastman is capable
lof the titanic task of beating Vic
| Williams, U.S.C.'s national 440
j champion, twice, and Bill BcGeagh,
( Troy's 1:55 half-miler, once in the
I space of two hours.
Templeton plans to use Les Hables,
who has repeatedly shown himself
capable of running the 100, 220, and
440 at maximum speed in the same
meet, for a leg in the relay as well
as a running mate for "Hurrying
Hector" Dyer in the sprints. If Les
| runs the 48.6 quarter which he can
run, not only would Eastman's task
be less Herculean, but also the
world s record of 3:13.6 and the in
i tercollegiate of 3:15.4, the latter held
by Stanford's 1930 team, would tot
-1 ter.
In case either Bangs or Les find
' they have bitten off more than they
can chew at the end of the quarter
and half next Saturday, then Tem
pleton can run Jimmy Howell.
Incapacitated two weeks ago by a
loulled muscle, Howell proved him
! self back in shape again by running
a 50.4 quarter yesterday.
Two other encouraging time trials
were held. Running to stimulate Sam

! Eastman, Paul Aebersold stepped the
mile in 4:34.4. Sam, five yards be
! hind him, stopped the watch at
: 4:35.4.
j Then Abe Hables strode a 352-
! yard dash in 37.3 seconds, a mark
1 which is within three-tenths of a
second of Bangs Eastman's best per
! formance.
Ending two weeks of intense prac
; tice, Templeton advised his men to
lay off practice till after the "Big
Meet." "Then you'll be full of gin
; ger," was what he gave as his rea
: son.
At Dink's request, conscientious
; Bangs Eastman did not come out for
practice.*Hc has earned a rest. Dur
; ing the last fortnight he has run the
' 440 in 48, 48.1, and 48.2 seconds, the
half-mile in 1:52.6, and the 660 in
1:18.8. His marks in the quarter and
' half-mile were within a second of
the world's records for these events.
! The 660 time is within six-tenths of
; a second of Ted Miller's best mark,
land Miller, who is known as one of
Stanford's great quarter-milers, spe
cialized in the 6GO.
Vic Williams, Troy's great 440
I man, has generated some doubts as
to whether Eastman can beat him
j by his recent 48.4 quarter. The an
! swer to these doubts is the 48 fiat
j performance of Bangs, made on two
i turns. Williams ran his race around
1 one.

1 which is within three-tenths of a
second of Bangs Eastman's best per

Ending two weeks of intense prac
; tice, Templeton advised his men to
lay off practice till after the "Big
Meet." "Then you'll be full of gin
; ger," was what he gave as his rea
: son.
At Dink's request, conscientious
; Bangs Eastman did not come out for
practice.*Hc has earned a rest. Dur
; ing the last fortnight he has run the
' 440 in 48, 48.1, and 48.2 seconds, the
half-mile in 1:52.6, and the 660 in
1:18.8. His marks in the quarter and
' half-mile were within a second of
the world's records for these events.
! The 660 time is within six-tenths of
; a second of Ted Miller's best mark,
land Miller, who is known as one of
Stanford's great quarter-milers, spe
cialized in the 6GO.
Vic Williams, Troy's great 440
I man, has generated some doubts as
to whether Eastman can beat him
j by his recent 48.4 quarter. The an
! swer to these doubts is the 48 fiat
j performance of Bangs, made on two
i turns. Williams ran his race around
1 one.
Ben Eastman and Les Hables, per-
I haps Stanford's two greatest run
; ners, may each run three races
against California next Saturday,
j according to* Coach Dink Templeton.
Dink wants to find out once and
I for all whether Eastman is capable
lof the titanic task of beating Vic
| Williams, U.S.C.'s national 440
j champion, twice, and Bill BcGeagh,
( Troy's 1:55 half-miler, once in the
I space of two hours.
Templeton plans to use Les Hables,
who has repeatedly shown himself
capable of running the 100, 220, and
440 at maximum speed in the same
meet, for a leg in the relay as well
as a running mate for "Hurrying
Hector" Dyer in the sprints. If Les
| runs the 48.6 quarter which he can
run, not only would Eastman's task
be less Herculean, but also the
world s record of 3:13.6 and the in
i tercollegiate of 3:15.4, the latter held
by Stanford's 1930 team, would tot
-1 ter.
In case either Bangs or Les find
' they have bitten off more than they
can chew at the end of the quarter
and half next Saturday, then Tem
pleton can run Jimmy Howell.
Incapacitated two weeks ago by a
loulled muscle, Howell proved him
! self back in shape again by running
a 50.4 quarter yesterday.
Two other encouraging time trials
were held. Running to stimulate Sam
