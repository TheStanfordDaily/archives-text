# GLEDHILL WILL MEET BLADE IN U.C. NET TILTS
## Probable Match Brackets, For Clash Saturday Announced 
### 
Probable pairings for the Cali
fornia matches Saturday mornlng'at
10 o'clock were made known yes
terday by Coach Lockwood and
Herb Hazeltine, tennis manager.
Gledhill, of course, will meet Blade
in the feature set-to, and Easton
will probably vie with Hyde for
second-match honors.
Unless the Bears shift their line
up, it is expected that the remaining
four singles events will be Cough
lin vs. Ludlow, Plymire vs. Gal
loway,- Stephens vs. Sea, and -Nie
derauer vs. Neiden. Doubles pair
ings are not yet certain, but either
the Gledhill-Easton or Plymire-
Coughlin combination will not com
pete, second- and third-match re
sponsibility falling to Niederauef-
Cox and Butler-Forbes.
Whichever team runs up against
Ludlow and Olney will have no
easy time of it. This crack two-man
combination overwhelmed DeLara
and Stokes by a 6-1, 6-0 score in
their northern matches with U.S.C.,
and should prove a tough pair for
any of the local boys.
Easton, free at last from the
Muehliesen jinx that has always
been present heretofore to effective
ly block his way, should have a
none-too-easy or none-too-hard
time with Hyde. Both defeated Wil
son of U.S.C. by almost equally de
cisive scores, with the count a little
in the favor of the local second man.
If comparative scores mean any
thing, Joe Coughlin should have a
really tough opponent in the per
son of Ludlow, who defeated their
mutual Trojan foe, Barr, by a con
siderably more decisive margin than
did the Indian netman.
Likewise Harry Plymire will face
a player who downed Captain Flum
of the Trojans in straight sets, as
against Plymire's three-set win.
However, Coughlin and Plymire may
shift positions. Stephens and Nieder
auer are being counted on to turn
in victories in their tilts, and hopes
of a 7-2, 8-1, or even S-0 win are
not too optimistic.
