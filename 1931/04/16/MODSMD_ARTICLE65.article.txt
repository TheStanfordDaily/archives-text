# WILLIS RAPS FEAR OF QUAKE RUMOR CIRCULATED HERE
## Prediction May Be Due To Insurance Companies, Says Professor 
### Rolph Malloch 
Any current apprehension over an
earthquake scheduled to take place
in this part of California next month
was shattered yesterday by the
statement of Bailey Willis, Professor
Emeritus of Geology and long emi
nent in the field of geological re
search. The proposed quake, said to
have originated in the prediction of
a French scientist, would, through a
25-year recurrence theory, shake
next month's calendar with more
disastrous effects than that of 1906.
Professor Willis stated that "No
one has information on which to
predict an earthquake at any par
ticular time. It sometimes happens
that a number of minor shocks of
sufficient intensity to attract notice
follow one another in a manner
which suggests the probability of a
major shock in the not distant fu
ture. However, nothing of the kind
has been reported in central Cali
fornia in recent years, and there is
no reason for any special apprehen
sion.
"Nevertheless, a severe earthquake
may occur tomoiTow, for we have
little knowledge of the forces at
work within the earth."
The Stanford scientist expressed
the opinion that insurance com
panies are probably responsible for
the rumor of an earthquake, since
it is these companies which would
profit from alarm on the part of
building owners.
"The risk at Stanford is far less
than in 1906," explained Professor
Willis, "because the lesson of that
disaster resulted in reconstruction
according to the best quake-proof
methods of the time."
Professor Willis cites another ex
ample of amusing prophecy in a
letter he received a few days ago
predicting the end of the world on
May 8. The letter-writer asked Wil
lis to meet him at the Oakland ferry
station early in the morning of that
day, so that they could meet death
together.
