# POMONA HAS UNIQUE DEBATE ORGANIZATION
## 
### 
According to Robert Shelton of
Pomona College, which he repre
sented in a debate with Stanford
recently, his college has a unique
type of debating organization, in
which the members eat and argue at
the same time.
Corresponding roughly to the
Stanford eating clubs, these Foren
sic Unions, for both men and women,
sponsor arguments at each meal on
a particular subject. AH of the
members must join in the discus
sions, except when they occasionally
invite a prominent citizen to address
the members during the meal.
