A dire warning, or, as the case
| may be, a good promise, which ap
-1 peared in the Stanford Illustrated
| Review for February, is about to be
I fulfilled. Readers were informed
i that reunion classes made it a point
j to revive their old class yells, get
together somewhere on the Quad
I and release it as they used to do.
I As a result, next Saturday we may
j expect to hear reverberating
| through the arches and classrooms
! unearthly cries such as the old yell
| of '95:
Zah Zah Zeer—
We're right here!
'95, '95
Pioneer!
; Whether this is something to be
! looked forward to or something to
be avoided with a careful skirting
of the Quad on Saturday is some- j
1 thing to be decided by the indi-
I vidual. The student body can do
nothing.
