# SHOUSE FLAYS G.O.P. TACTICS IN DINNER TALK
## Democratic Leader Here To Settle Problems Of Party In West 
### 
Jouett Shouse, right-hand man to
Democratic National Committee
Chairman Raskob, came to town
yesterday morning; was quickly
taken under the wing of the War
dell faction in the party; saw a
number of Bourbon leaders during
the day, and then lambasted the tar
out of the Republicans at a Jeffer
son-Jackson-Woodrow Wilson din
ner at the Elks' Club last night.
Shouse, a politician with a mag
netic personality; tall and well tai
lored 1 ; alert in mind and never at a
loss for words, waded right into the
problems facing the Democrats in
this State with its warring factions
and did his best to ignore the rival
claims in the interest of party har
mony for the 1932 presidential cam
paign.
Shouse Welcomed
Before his day had ended, Shouse
had been welcomed by the munici
pal band and Democrats galore at
the railroad station; had lunched
with Justus S. Wardell, Raskob-A1
Smith wet faction leader; had met
numberless Democrats of various
factional shades at the Palace Hotel,
and had ended with his speech at
the dinner attended by several hun
dred persons.
Prohibition; the Hoover adminis
tration; San Francisco as a possi
ble location for the next Democratic
convention; Raskob, A1 Smith, Gov
ernor Roosevelt; economic issues,
the power question; possible party
nominees; third parties; the neces
sity for revitalizing the Democratic
party in California, were matters
discussed by Shouse at one time or
another during his day and evening.
Wet Issue Broached
Shouse indicated that the na
tional Democratic leaders would at
tempt to suboudinate the wet and
dry issue to economic issues in the
next presidential campaign. He
stated that, since the Republicans
had claimed credit for prosperity,
they must also shoulder the blame
for the depression. Shouse declared
that the Republicans were "split and
torn and that "today in Congress,
though the Democrats have not yet
a majority in either house, they
control the legislative branch of the
Government because they represent
the one coherent element in those
bodies." Shouse also attacked the
G.O.P. tariff bill which protects so
many California products.
"Unemployment is the sore thumb
of the Nation," Shouse declared. He
said that power would be another
important issue in the coming presi
dential tilt, as would the tariff. Gov
ernor Roosevelt, Newton D. Baker,
former Governor Byrd of Virginia,
Governor Ritchie, Senator Joe Rob
inson, former Senator Jim Reed,
possibly Owen D. Young, and maybe
A1 Smith, would be among the
names likely to be placed before
the next Democratic convention,
Shouse stated.

Government because they represent
the one coherent element in those
bodies." Shouse also attacked the
G.O.P. tariff bill which protects so
many California products.
"Unemployment is the sore thumb
of the Nation," Shouse declared. He
said that power would be another
important issue in the coming presi
dential tilt, as would the tariff. Gov
ernor Roosevelt, Newton D. Baker,
former Governor Byrd of Virginia,
Governor Ritchie, Senator Joe Rob
inson, former Senator Jim Reed,
possibly Owen D. Young, and maybe
A1 Smith, would be among the
names likely to be placed before
the next Democratic convention,
Shouse stated.
Jouett Shouse, right-hand man to
Democratic National Committee
Chairman Raskob, came to town
yesterday morning; was quickly
taken under the wing of the War
dell faction in the party; saw a
number of Bourbon leaders during
the day, and then lambasted the tar
out of the Republicans at a Jeffer
son-Jackson-Woodrow Wilson din
ner at the Elks' Club last night.
Shouse, a politician with a mag
netic personality; tall and well tai
lored 1 ; alert in mind and never at a
loss for words, waded right into the
problems facing the Democrats in
this State with its warring factions
and did his best to ignore the rival
claims in the interest of party har
mony for the 1932 presidential cam
paign.
Shouse Welcomed
Before his day had ended, Shouse
had been welcomed by the munici
pal band and Democrats galore at
the railroad station; had lunched
with Justus S. Wardell, Raskob-A1
Smith wet faction leader; had met
numberless Democrats of various
factional shades at the Palace Hotel,
and had ended with his speech at
the dinner attended by several hun
dred persons.
Prohibition; the Hoover adminis
tration; San Francisco as a possi
ble location for the next Democratic
convention; Raskob, A1 Smith, Gov
ernor Roosevelt; economic issues,
the power question; possible party
nominees; third parties; the neces
sity for revitalizing the Democratic
party in California, were matters
discussed by Shouse at one time or
another during his day and evening.
Wet Issue Broached
Shouse indicated that the na
tional Democratic leaders would at
tempt to suboudinate the wet and
dry issue to economic issues in the
next presidential campaign. He
stated that, since the Republicans
had claimed credit for prosperity,
they must also shoulder the blame
for the depression. Shouse declared
that the Republicans were "split and
torn and that "today in Congress,
though the Democrats have not yet
a majority in either house, they
control the legislative branch of the
Government because they represent
the one coherent element in those
bodies." Shouse also attacked the
G.O.P. tariff bill which protects so
many California products.
