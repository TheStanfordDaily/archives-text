# INDIAN NINE FACES STIFF PROGRAM IN COMING WEEK-END
## Bat Wielders Meet Bruins Today; Final U.C. Tilt Here Tomorrow LOOMIS STARTS GAME Horner Will Be On Mound For Bear Contest 
### Francis Lloyd 
Meeting the tottering U.C.L.A.
Bruins at 3:15 o'clock today on the
local diamond and coming to grips
for the third and last time this sea
son with California at 3:30 o'clock
tomorrow, the Stanford nine looks
forward to a fairly active week-end.
Deciding to start Hal Riede in the
S.F.U. tilt rather than in today's
game, Harry Wolter has selected
Vard Loomis and Ike Livermore as
the battery which will face the
Bruins. Livermore,.who was slowed
up by an attack of flu, should be
prepared to give a good workout be
hind the plate.
Horner Will Pitch
Reports from Berkeley indicate
that Clint Evans will attempt to re
deem the Golden Bears' hurt feel
ings by starting Norm Horner again.
Dan Johnson will be out after his
third straight victory over the Bears,
a feat which has only been accom
plished once before in the history of
Stanford baseball.
Practice this week would tend to
lead to the impression that the hit
ting on the part of Stanford will be
even more severe than in the last
California encounter. Philippi, who
was in a slight slump, has appar
ently completely regained his bat
ting eye.
Team Shows Alertness
An ability to take advantage of all
the breaks that have occurred in
the California series so far has char
acterized the play of the Indian nine.
The infield particularly has been
able to come through with needed
double plays and important put-outs
when they were needed.
Mathematical chances for the
Cards to store away the 1931 pen
nant should they take both games
this week-end will be greatly im
proved. This would leave Stanford
with but two games to play, both
being with S.F.U., who have, at no
time this season, shown very much
strength.
U.S.C. Plays St. Mary's
On the other hand the Trojans
have yet •to play their series with
Saint Mary's, a team which has been
becoming increasingly dangerous
after a disastrous early season rec
ord. Noonan of the Gaels may be
able to give Sam Barry's men quite
a bit to worry about.
It is interesting to note the three
teams which tave taken a crack at
the Big Three's percentage column.
U.C.L.A. defeated Stanford, and in
cidentally with Johnson on the
mound, Santa Clara overturned the
unbeaten Bears, and Saint Mary's
gave the Trojans a good trouncing
on the latters northern invasion.

the New Republican Government,

Uruguay had recognized the New
Republic. He added that Argentina
would follow suit.

ting eye.
Team Shows Alertness
An ability to take advantage of all
the breaks that have occurred in
the California series so far has char
acterized the play of the Indian nine.
The infield particularly has been
able to come through with needed
double plays and important put-outs
when they were needed.
Mathematical chances for the
Cards to store away the 1931 pen
nant should they take both games
this week-end will be greatly im
proved. This would leave Stanford
with but two games to play, both
being with S.F.U., who have, at no
time this season, shown very much
strength.
U.S.C. Plays St. Mary's
On the other hand the Trojans
have yet •to play their series with
Saint Mary's, a team which has been
becoming increasingly dangerous
after a disastrous early season rec
ord. Noonan of the Gaels may be
able to give Sam Barry's men quite
a bit to worry about.
It is interesting to note the three
teams which tave taken a crack at
the Big Three's percentage column.
U.C.L.A. defeated Stanford, and in
cidentally with Johnson on the
mound, Santa Clara overturned the
unbeaten Bears, and Saint Mary's
gave the Trojans a good trouncing
on the latters northern invasion.
MADRID, April 16. (/P)—Alejan
dro Lerroux, Minister of State in
the New Republican Government,
today announced that Mexico and
Uruguay had recognized the New
Republic. He added that Argentina
would follow suit.
Meeting the tottering U.C.L.A.
Bruins at 3:15 o'clock today on the
local diamond and coming to grips
for the third and last time this sea
son with California at 3:30 o'clock
tomorrow, the Stanford nine looks
forward to a fairly active week-end.
Deciding to start Hal Riede in the
S.F.U. tilt rather than in today's
game, Harry Wolter has selected
Vard Loomis and Ike Livermore as
the battery which will face the
Bruins. Livermore,.who was slowed
up by an attack of flu, should be
prepared to give a good workout be
hind the plate.
Horner Will Pitch
Reports from Berkeley indicate
that Clint Evans will attempt to re
deem the Golden Bears' hurt feel
ings by starting Norm Horner again.
Dan Johnson will be out after his
third straight victory over the Bears,
a feat which has only been accom
plished once before in the history of
Stanford baseball.
Practice this week would tend to
lead to the impression that the hit
ting on the part of Stanford will be
even more severe than in the last
California encounter. Philippi, who
was in a slight slump, has appar
ently completely regained his bat
ting eye.
