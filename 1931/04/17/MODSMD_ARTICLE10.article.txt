| Shaking down several of the larger
! and more ornate of the University
' buildings and killing two persons,
the San Francisco earthquake, oc
curring just twenty-five years ago
tomorrow,' caused damages to the
University to the extent of $2,800,000
and prevented further University
activities for the remainder of the
semester.
Coming at 5:07 o'clock on the
morning of April 18, 1906, and last
ing for a minute and a half, the
quake completely demolished the
new library and men's gymnasium,
both buildings being situated on La
suen street near the site of the an
nual Big Game Rally bonfire, where
the foundations still remain as mute
evidence of the great temblor.
The Memorial Church was practi
cally wrecked by the falling of the
great clock tower above the chapel
dome, the stone arch at the entrance
of the Memorial Court was shaken
down, and one wing of the Museum
and parts of the English Building
were razed to the ground. The
Chemistry Building, containing
many valuable chemicals, was

i ruined by the shock. Most of the
| fraternity and sorority houses, as
well as Encina, were partially de
stroyed. Old Roble Hall, now Se
quoia, was one of the few buildings
} to remain almost undamaged.
Of the two men killed, one, Otto
Gerdis, an employee, was buried by
the falling boiler stack of the power
house, near the present Press Build
ing, as he went in to turn off the
power in order to prevent fire. The
other, J. R. Hanna, was caught in
his room in Encina and crushed by
an immense chimney which crashed
through the front wing to the base
j ment.
Immediate relief corps were
> formed to aid rescue work in San
j Francisco, distributing food, caring
| for the wounded, and patroling fire
i districts.
Athletic contests were immediate
| ly called off. For the only time in
; history did the Big Meet with Cali
; fornia fail to take place. And also
| for the first time did the annual
; baseball series with Berkeley re
! main a tie at one game apiece. Crew
