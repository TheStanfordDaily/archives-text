# Californians Face Certain Defeat In Annual Meet Here
## Christie Boasts Best Berkeley Oval Squad Since 1926; Pool, Vantress, Sparks, and Deberry Develop Into New Quartet of Bear Stars STANFORD VICTORY, 90 TO 41, IS EXPECTED Interest to Center in Performance of Ben Eastman, Entered in Three Track Events Tomorrow 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
||OPELESSLY beaten even before a single spike has bitten into the
cinders of the Stadium track, an invading Golden Bear will renew
its ancient and long-disastrous oval rivalry with a confident Indian as the
38th Big Meet gets under way tomorrow afternoon at 1:45 o'clock.
Nevertheless, it will not be a pessimistic crowd of Berkeleyites who
journey Farmward, for Coach Walter Christie boasts his best track and
field team since 1926, when the Blue and Gold last threatened Templeton's

squads by scoring 62 points.
Four New Stars
The answer to this greatly im-
I proved Bear squad comes in the
; form of four gentlemen who have
developed so rapidly this season that
they find it hard to believe what
they read about themselves in the
papers.
Pool and Vantress, vaulters, have
| shown perhaps the most startling
development, having become poten
tial world-beaters after starting the
year at the mediocre height of 12
feet 6 inches.
Spencer Sparks, who tagged away
I in the rear of the Indian dash men
| last season, bids fair to break into
: the scoring column tomorrow with
| about four points in the two events.
! He has run a 9.7 century and a 21.4
| furlong.
DeBerry, fourth of the quartet of
new Bear stars, put the shot past 48
I feet this year for the first time in
| his life.
U.C. Veterans Back
I Added to these newcomers are
California's "Iron Man," Spud Moss
man, and Ken Churchill, intercolle
giate javelin champ. Mossman, who
took both the mile and two-mile
J from Templeton's men in 1930, will
! confine his efforts to the eight-lap
1 grind tomorrow, and should win at
| about 9:40.
But in spite of the efforts of these
| visitors, Stanford should triumph by
I about 90 to 41. Individual duels will
< provide the features, as well as a
j possible new meet record or two.
| It will be interesting to see what
j Ben Eastman can do running three
j races all in one afternoon. The blond
I sophomore flash will participate in
j the 440, the 880, and the relay, with
! an excellent chance of breaking the
j tape in each event.
