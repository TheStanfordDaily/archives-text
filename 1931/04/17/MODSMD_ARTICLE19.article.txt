"California lias initiated a new honor for which one
may become famous, namely, for being a good loser. With
the regularity of our defeats, we have assumed a superi
ority complex in being the best of all defeated teams. And
as yet we have found no rivals who so rejoice in so success
fully coming out on the short end of the score."
Those were the earnest rewarks of the Daily Californian
Wednesday morning. Tomorrow the entrie U.C. student
body will have one of the happiest times imaginable, one
which will rank with last week-end as a grand success.
For tomorrow California will have another opportunity to
demonstrate its possession of "the best of all defeated
teams." Tomorrow the Bear will have another opportunity
to dance with glee over his short end of the score, and men
from across the bay may again congratulate themselves on
the success of losing.
Of course, it would hardly be fair, late tomorrow after
noon, to give the Bear all the credit for successfully drop
ping another meet. The Stanford alumni gathered here for
the annual University Day celebration will join with the
undergraduate student body in crediting the Cardinal
trackmen with their share in winning the thirty-eighth Big
Meet.
But, while Stanford rejoices over another victory, it may
good-humoredly enjoy watching a cheerful Golden Bear
drag his tail homeward—and like it!
