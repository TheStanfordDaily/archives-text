After a mere 30 years of gymnastic poverty, the 500
today will engage in their promised feast as the new Roble
Gymnasium is dedicated with much shouting and blowing
of whistles.
But the work of the 500 does not end today. The new
structure must be furnished and equipped, a $20,000 job
that the $250,000 gift of the Board of Athletic Control did
not cover. The women have undertaken to raise that $20,-
000 themselves. Already they have accumulated $3,800,
and tomorrow they will endeavor to add to that total, with
a kaffee klatsch, whatever that may be, and the sale of
concessions at the track meet and baseball game with Cali
fornia. ; i
A lot of coffee and ice cream will have to be consumed
before the new gym is furnished, so here's hoping for some
healthy appetites tomorrow.
