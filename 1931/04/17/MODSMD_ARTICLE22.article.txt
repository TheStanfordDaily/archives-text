# TURN TO PAGE TWO

Silen t Gal, nobody's pal, is now on the second page. His
daily blurb, his thought superb, still earns his daily wage.
In accents clear, both far and near, his clarion words roll
on. The headlines black no sheet does lack; but from front
pages he is gone.
In times of old when Gal was bold he chose to champion
truth. The hoary sage, the old of age, has given way to
youth. Once number one, his number's none—he's buried
in the sheet. He cares 110 whit, he does his bit on whatever
seems most meet.
So with his pen, one and again, Gal slays the dragon
evil. He writes of floods, he writes of buds, he treats of
the boll weevil. Though buried deep, his credos sweep
across a blighted nation. Our hopes to raise for days and
days he's doled his daily ration.
Economy his watchword be forever and forever! In
life's hard race he's lost his place; let no one whisper
"Never."— Oregon Emerald.
