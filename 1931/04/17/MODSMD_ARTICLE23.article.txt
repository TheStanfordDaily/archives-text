EX COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE
TO VOTE

All is not quiet on the dancing ;
front! The Rally Committee (of ask- i
-the-man-in-the-red-cap fame) de
sires to have the Masque Ball. The i
Executive Committee of the student 1
body has voted: that the rally group :
shall have a suppressed desire in re- !
gards to the annual dance. The bat- j
tie is now raging; but in truth, it is ;
a very one-sided battle in that the !
Ex Committee does not have to
fight.—It just votes.
Now we appreciate the full force
of *the economy program that is j
sweeping this nation from the fed- j
eral government to the A.S.S.U. of- |
fice. We also have high regard for i
the kindly spirit of the Rally Com- !
mittee in wishing to aid the little '
kiddies in the Convalescent Home by
throwing a big dance in their espe
cial honor. It is quite evident that
our impartiality knows no bounds.
The Ex Committee evidentally j
feels that there are not enough An- !
gels of Mercy on the campus to pro- j
duce the required funds. They feel, :
it would seem, that not only would |
the Convalescent Home receive \
nothing but publicity from the ball; j
but the A.S.S.U. treasury might j
even have to finance the dance that |
is supposed to give monetary aid to ;
the home. Members of the Rally j
Committee, however, feel that the j
.-Cewupus is behind the move to help i
our tiny friends down behind the j
arboretum. Now it seems cruel — !
inhuman—to frustrate and '
tlwart the charitable feelings of the I
members of the student body..
We have not had enough eco- ;
nomics courses to decide which of 1

these groups is correct. There is a
way, however, in which the validity
of the two views can be decided. Let
a tentative date for the ball be set;
let the maximum cost of the dance
be determined. Surely no one could
object to these proposals because
they cost nothing. Then let the
Rally Committee try and sell reser
vations for the dance! The Masque
Ball will only materialize, however,
when enough reservations are sold
to cover the cost of the dance.
We are operating under the the
ory that if a person will pay one
dollar for a reservation, lie will glad
ly pay another three or four for his
bid rather than lose his original de
posit. Of course if the rally organi
zation has over judged the gener
osity cf this campus and not enough
reservations are sold (within a week
or so), the reservation price will be
returned.
Few will deny that there are more
profitable means of aiding the Con
valescent Home than a ball with or
chestra, punch, decorations and
other expenditures which do aid un
employment but which help the re
puted beneficiaries of the occasion
very little. On the other hand, the
Masque Ball is a colorful affair and
gives a lot of people the opportunity
to cover or uncover themselves with
attractive costumes.
If the dance can be held without
any direct expense to the student
body funds and with the possibility
of a little aid to the Convalescent
Home, it seems that the Ex Com
mittee should reconsider its decision
in vetoing the Masque Ball for the
spring quarter of 1931.
