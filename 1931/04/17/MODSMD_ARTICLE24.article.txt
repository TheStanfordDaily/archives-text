THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL
YEN. By Grace Zaring Stone.
Bobbs-Merrill. Indianapolis. 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
In an attempt to show the clash
between two civilizations—one the
ancient, cultured Chinese, the other
the "missionaric," helpful American
—Mrs. Stone has 'written the
strangely exciting experiences of a
New England girl, wounded in try
ing to escape from an about to be
captured American orphanage.
She is rescued by General Yen,
the brilliant, educated leader who
shows her "real China" existing
without need of Western institu
tions.
In spite of the depth that the
theme would seem to demand, the
story as a whole skims it lightly,
avoids moralizing, and turns out to
be a mediocre, momentarily interest
ing novel. —J.N.

MANGA EEVA. By Robert Lee
Eskridge. Bobbs-Merrill. Indian
apolis. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Queen Marau of Tahiti suggested
Eskridge's visit to Manga Reva, "The
Forgotten Islands' 'where the super
natural just happens, where Laval,
the mad priest, ruled for many ty
ranical years, where pearls are val
ued less than cigarettes. And in a
style that enhances the glamour of
the Tropics, influenced by the per
manent spell cast on him as he
neared the Islands, Eskridge recre
ates the Lost Continent, and the age
of Cannibal Kings.
He fascinates readers with his im
agination, his word pictures of
wierd customs, and his descriptions.
One would like to visit the garden
that he planted on the island that
awaits his return. Although not fiCr.
tional, "Manga Reva" is better than

many a novel.
