# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Welcome, Alumni, and all the
things we who remain say to you a
bit sheepishly, each year when you
return. Funny part is, we really are
glad to have you back among us for
a couple of days, and particularly to
consider objectively what the future
may hold in store for us, say about
1962.
We gloat, turn handsprings,
and try to find a couple of fools
who will bet on a California
victory, tomorrow. Maybe it's
due to unemployment, or the
lack of rain, but victims to the
trick are scarce in this vicinity.
Barring death, destruction, strained
muscles, or too radical change of
diet, we may count on seeing the
Indian half of the Stadium score
board pretty well covered with first
place, first-class records. Too much
confidence, of course, is bad for the
soul, but a little's darned good for
the appetite. Who wants a soul, any
how?
And unless Mary, Mary, quite
contrary, smiles with unusual
sweetness at little Norm Horner,
and supposing that our pal John
son has his usual unparalleled
good luck at lotto, lessons, and
love, we may count on a base
ball game worth writing Uncle
Herbert about.
Meanwhile, beware of suddenly
grabbing a military student's arm,
for any reason whatsoever. Seems
that some 50-odd R.O.T.C. students

were yesterday afflicted with the
second of a series of "shots" to guard
against hoof-and-mouth disease, or
maybe homesickness—anyhow, a re
quired precaution for those who at
tend summer camp. Aches, pains,
sore arms, headaches, wounded dis
positions, and excuses for practically
anything are listed among the pos
sible symptoms.
Here's your chance then, girls.
Just look sympathetically at a
uniform, and you'll get the
whole story plus an extra star in
heaven. King George, the eagle,
and an army mule! Three cheers!
Speaking of international spirit,
just look at what we have to offer
in three days' time. Starting with a
Russian opera (very minor); through
a German breakfast; Athletic after
noon with Conglomerate Co-eds
selling balloons made in Jugoslavia,
ice cream from Mexico, and soda
pop from an Anglicized Belgian

brewery; good old Amereecan bar
becue dinner; Spanish tango music
for evening's entertainment; and an
English church service if you last
that long. Good luck!

just look at what we have to offer
in three days' time. Starting with a
Russian opera (very minor); through
a German breakfast; Athletic after
noon with Conglomerate Co-eds
selling balloons made in Jugoslavia,
ice cream from Mexico, and soda
pop from an Anglicized Belgian

brewery; good old Amereecan bar
becue dinner; Spanish tango music
for evening's entertainment; and an
English church service if you last
that long. Good luck!
Welcome, Alumni, and all the
things we who remain say to you a
bit sheepishly, each year when you
return. Funny part is, we really are
glad to have you back among us for
a couple of days, and particularly to
consider objectively what the future
may hold in store for us, say about
1962.
We gloat, turn handsprings,
and try to find a couple of fools
who will bet on a California
victory, tomorrow. Maybe it's
due to unemployment, or the
lack of rain, but victims to the
trick are scarce in this vicinity.
Barring death, destruction, strained
muscles, or too radical change of
diet, we may count on seeing the
Indian half of the Stadium score
board pretty well covered with first
place, first-class records. Too much
confidence, of course, is bad for the
soul, but a little's darned good for
the appetite. Who wants a soul, any
how?
And unless Mary, Mary, quite
contrary, smiles with unusual
sweetness at little Norm Horner,
and supposing that our pal John
son has his usual unparalleled
good luck at lotto, lessons, and
love, we may count on a base
ball game worth writing Uncle
Herbert about.
Meanwhile, beware of suddenly
grabbing a military student's arm,
for any reason whatsoever. Seems
that some 50-odd R.O.T.C. students

were yesterday afflicted with the
second of a series of "shots" to guard
against hoof-and-mouth disease, or
maybe homesickness—anyhow, a re
quired precaution for those who at
tend summer camp. Aches, pains,
sore arms, headaches, wounded dis
positions, and excuses for practically
anything are listed among the pos
sible symptoms.
Here's your chance then, girls.
Just look sympathetically at a
uniform, and you'll get the
whole story plus an extra star in
heaven. King George, the eagle,
and an army mule! Three cheers!
Speaking of international spirit,
just look at what we have to offer
in three days' time. Starting with a
Russian opera (very minor); through
