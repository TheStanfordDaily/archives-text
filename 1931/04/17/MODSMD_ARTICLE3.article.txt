The fourth international holiday
! camp will be held this year, under
! the auspices of the National Student
; Federation of America, at Melk,
| Austria, the gateway to the famous
j stretch of the Austrian Danube
j known as the Wachau.
The camp will be organized by Os
j car Bock, director of the Viennese
office of the Committee for Interna
tional Relations and Travel. The
campers will be housed in the Melk
primary school from August 2 to

Each day's program will be ar
| ranged by the leader in consultation
| with the members of the camp. The
| Wachau is exceptionally rich in art
j treasures of the baroque period and
| is surrounded by hills rising to a
height of 3,000 feet. Excursions will
| be made to Spitz, the famous Mel
I convent, the ruined castle of Agg
| stein, and an ascent of the Jauer-
I ling will be a feature of a two days'
| tramp through the whole length of
; fhe Wachau.
All members of the camp must be
i in possession of an international stu
! dent identity card, obtainable from
Bernarr Bates, Stanford chairman
! of the N.S.F.A. Committee or at the
A.S.S.U. offices. The number of
| campers will not exceed seventy.
I Applications should, therefore, be
! sent in as e&rly as possible to the'
i Commission for International Rela- j
i tions and Travel.
