# Cards Top Heavy Favorites to Win 38th Annual Big Meet
## Quartet of Templeton's Potential Record Breakers Doped to Shut Out Blue and Gold Rivals in Their Event Tomorrow 
### 
HABLES BROKEN
This boy just can't be
shackled — even by the>
Administration. "Abe"
has grown grey waiting
to sprint around the
Farm and now his day
has come. He's fast in
anything from the 100 to
a half mile. Originally a
quarter miler, Dink made
him into a sprinter.
Watch for '-him -in the
century, furlong, and re
lay. I fables : is" on'e part
of a brother aet. "Ike"
runs the quarter.

THREE OF A KIND
Except Iiec Dyer (left) is a sprinter 011 Templeton's track
squad while Ernie Brandsten (middle) and Harry Wolter are
coaches—of swimming and baseball, respectively. But all three
are winners. Dyer is expected to win the 100 and 220 tomorrow.
Brandsten's swimming squad defeated California for the umty
umpth time this year, and Wolter's men need four more victories
to cop the pennant.

UP 'N' AT 'EM!
That's the way Captain Podge
Smith takes the barriers.' ' His
name may be Smith, but he's 110
common hurdler. He's just one
more link in a series of famous
Stanford hurdlers that dates way
back to 1915 when Feg Murray
used to skim over the sticks.
Smith is doped to win both the
120 highs and 220 lows tomor
row—with a chance of lowering
the record in the latter event. He
will be shadowed by Nisbet and
Herbert of his own team all the
way along, with Bondshn of
California making a bid for a
place.

"BOY" COACH
"Dink's gotten to be a
man during" the last five
or six years, but he's still
young enough to get a
laugh out of .the annual
skinning of the Bear.
How "Dink" turns out
his teams is a mystery.
He himself tells the story •
how a track coach, un
aware that "Dink" was
listening, stated that
Tempi eton, while coach
ing, gets up from his
chair eyery once in a
while to pat a shot putter
on the back. "Dink" said,
"It's a lie—I never, even
get up."

GO EAST, YOUNG MAN!
And if you find another like him, wire me and I'll send it in to Ripley,
said Greeley. After practicing- up on the Bears and Troy, Ben Eastman
iught to brush past 'em in the I.C.4-A.'s at Cambridge when the 440 and
880 are in progress. This skinny, bespectacled blond youngster, looking
anything but a-runner, has negotiated the quarter in 48 flat and the half
in 1: 56: 2. If Dink tried him in the mile, he might wade into the tape in
three minutes and something. Watch for him in the relay, too.
