# CHRISTIE'S LAST VICTORY IN 1923
## Bear Mentor Taught Dink Tricks Of High Jump 
### 
Walter Christie's California team j
hasn't won a Big Meet from Stan- I
ford since 1923, and tomorrow after- j
noon "Dink" Templeton is again fa- |
vored to win. Christie has been at j
California since 1901, and for the ,
last 30 years has been developing |
track stars. This is Templeton's j
tenth year coaching the Stanford j
team. These two well-known track :
personalities are not the least inter- |
esting part of the Big Meet.
By way of poetic justice, in 1920, j
Christie had the pleasure of in- j
structing "Dink" in some of the j
finer points of the high jump, in his ;
capacity of Olympic adviser.
Both of the coaches have had their I
teams win the I.C.4-A. champion- j
ship three years in succession, and |
have both taken an active part in j
the supervision of the Olympic
Games teams.
"Dink" is an athlete of great merit |
himself. While attending Stanford i
he received block S's in four sports, j
When he was first appointed to the i
coaching staff of the University, he j
was dubbed by the newspapers, "the j
boy coach." He has since then I
proven his worth by bringing prac
tically every conceivable honor to !
the Stanford track teams during the j
last 10 years.
