# EASTMAN WIS NO PREP STAR
## Blond Flash Just Another High School Runner 
### 
! '
j Three years ago a tall, blond,
j skinny youngster appeared on the
: Burlingame high-school track and
j signified his intention of trying the
! running racket for awhile. He didn't j
know anything about it, but he had !
nice long legs that propelled him j
around the oval in fair time, and in j
his first and only year of high- j
school competition he collected a j
good many points for Burlingame.
Then, as the old story goes, he |
came to Stanford. Robert Lyman
Templeton got him in his clutches.
And now that same skinny young
| ster is doing things every day or so
j that rob the far-from-bashful Dink
of his powers of speech.
Ben Bangs Eastman, '33, is the
lad who so affects the famous Car
dinal mentor. Whenever Ben Bangs
(the "Bangs" is not a nick-name)
I runs around the track in practice
! he records a time that has the on
| lookers wagging their heads help
lessly at each other. Times like 48.4,
48.2, 48 flat, are everyday occur
rences with him in the 440, while
his second 880 attempt netted the
J near-record mark of 1:52.6.
| In high school Eastman was j ust
i a good country athlete. He won the
] Peninsula and North Coast Section
championships in the 440, but his
| best time was something over 52,
| nothing much compared with the
> marks of Southern California stars.
| He placed sixth in the finals of the
I state meet, running his head off to
| hit 51 flat.
One of a Bunch
j ' At the start of the 1930 season j
i Ben was one of a bunch of "possi- |
j bilities," unheralded and unsung. 1
I But when the frosh season got under j
| way people began to hear' of this ;
; lad: "What's his name? Easton?"

To get started Ben won a couple
of races in 50 flat or thereabouts.
Then he got warmed up and cut
the time a few tenths of a second.
This got people excited somewhat,
but when he ran a 48.4 race against
the St. Ignatius frosh the surround
ing country woke up to the fact that
I there was a real star cavorting for
the Indian babes. The great Bud
Spencer, 400-meter world's record
holder, gave thanks aloud that he j
was through and would not have to |
run against this machine on legs. j
Although Ben cut his time to 48.2 ]
the following week, this produced
only a mild sensation, because of his
first startling achievement.
This year Eastman is undefeated
in varsity competition in the quar
ter and threatens to become the
I country's greatest half-miler. Each
! meet brings forth the possibility, al
i most the probability, that he will
j equal or beat a world's record, for
i he is developing all the time. Any
: way, if he doesn't beat 47.4 this
! year it will take a miracle to stop
j him in 1932 or 1933.
