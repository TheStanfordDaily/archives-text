# ALUMNI VANGUARD DUE TODAY; LARGE CROWDS EXPECTED
## Dinner Reservations Made Top Previous Records, Says McDowell 
### 
With the vanguard of the alumni
due on the campus sometime today
for the Junior Opera tonight, and
with the greatest crowd in the his
tory of University Day arriving to
morrow, the campus is set to re
ceive the returning visitors with the
best show that has ever been offered.
The announcement has come from
the office of John E. McDowell,
alumni secretary, that nearly 500
reservations have been received for
the alumni dinner tomorrow night—
a number unprecedented in the of
fice annals. McDowell attributes the
greater interest in 1931 to the stu
dent interest which has been stimu
lated for the first time.
Well Planned Day
From the first cup of coffee that
is sold in the morning at the Kaffee
Klatsch until the last note has been
sounded from the music of Joe
Thompson's band at the all-Univer
sity dance, the day will be replete
with interest for the graduates and
students.
An earthquake demonstration in
the hydraulic laboratory (1931 is the
25th anniversary of the earthquake
class of '06 that never graduated),
an exhibition at the Ryan Labora
tory, a barbecue, a track meet, a
ball game, a resident alumnae tea—
these are but the highlights in the
busy day.
Student Guides
The student's role during the day
is self-evident in the program. Stu
dent guides will conduct the alumni
to the demonstrations and anything
else they want to see in the morning.
Undergraduates are invited to and
have sent in reservations for the bar
becue at the Faculty Clubhouse and
the alumni dinner in the Women's
Gym. The Stanford band will play
in the morning and will give its an
nual concert in .the Union court at
the resident alumnae tea in the aft
ernoon.
Roy Reppy, president of the
Alumni Association, in his talk over
the Stanford program over KPO last
Sunday, said that he and all his
friends were counting on a reunion
of graduates and undergraduates at
the dance.
Alumni, from the numbers with
which their reservations have poured
in, are expectant, the campus is
ready, Jack McDowell is happy, and
all that is lacking is the dawn of
tomorrow's sun.

students.
An earthquake demonstration in
the hydraulic laboratory (1931 is the
25th anniversary of the earthquake
class of '06 that never graduated),
an exhibition at the Ryan Labora
tory, a barbecue, a track meet, a
ball game, a resident alumnae tea—
these are but the highlights in the
busy day.
Student Guides
The student's role during the day
is self-evident in the program. Stu
dent guides will conduct the alumni
to the demonstrations and anything
else they want to see in the morning.
Undergraduates are invited to and
have sent in reservations for the bar
becue at the Faculty Clubhouse and
the alumni dinner in the Women's
Gym. The Stanford band will play
in the morning and will give its an
nual concert in .the Union court at
the resident alumnae tea in the aft
ernoon.
Roy Reppy, president of the
Alumni Association, in his talk over
the Stanford program over KPO last
Sunday, said that he and all his
friends were counting on a reunion
of graduates and undergraduates at
the dance.
Alumni, from the numbers with
which their reservations have poured
in, are expectant, the campus is
ready, Jack McDowell is happy, and
all that is lacking is the dawn of
tomorrow's sun.
