# Bear Varsity Strong in Javelin, Pole Vault and Two Mile
## Ken Churchill, Captain Spud Mossman Big Guns of California; Spencer Sparks May Surprise Backers in Century, Furlong 
### 
THIRD'S A CHARM
v Pitcher Norm Horner 1 lost
couple of games this year
after six wins in two years
s. but the Bear infield gave him
s-little support. Also the hanks
rin Stanford's outfield may
ihnve disconcerted him. But
.the Indians will need more
, than axe-handles tomorrow.

HE GATHERS NO MOSS
Does this sorrel topped individual to our
left, but he has acquired a very high polish
however while running a mile or two for
his Alma Mater. Captain Spud Mossman is
Christie's super threat and ought to take
either the mile or two-mile or both. Crown
will furnish him plenty of competition in
the former and Aebersold in the latter.

ELECTRICAL
That's the effect of the young man below
on Crick Morse, but he's just a firefly to
the Card sprinters. Spencer Sparks is a
good man, though, and may prove too good
for Dyer, I fables, and Lombardi in the ecu-'
tury tomorrow. He is not quite so fast in
the furlong.

A FAST MAN
But Bill Strom of the University of
California isn't fast enough, liis team
mate Sparks will cut him out of any point
the Bears will take in the sprints tomor
row. He's not expected to place, with
Dyer, Hables, Lombardi to contend with,
let alone his speedy rival from his own
university. But you never can tell; he
may figure in the scoring column.

HURDLER
Is. Mister Lowell Bond
shu of the Golden Hears,
but the Cards are against
him tomorrow — Smith,
Nisbet, and Herbert. This
trio ought to place plenty
of splinters in Bondshu's
alley. He.may or may not
grab a point or so for Cali
fornia—probably not.

RENARD LOOKS 'EM OVER
Glenn S coble Warner, the slip
pery genius of the gridiron,-takes a
squint down the line at the powers
behind the throne —of King Foot
ball. In order he sees Jimmy Che
lan, Washington ; ".Headman" Jones,
l.S.CV; Bill Ingram, California,
Fritz Crisler, Minnesota, and Jack
Cannell, Dartmouth, all of whom he
will face this fall.

BLUE MENTOR
Who wouldn't be? Since
1919 Walt Christie has bowed
to the inevitable. Cut win or
lose the dean of the Pacific
Coast track coaches comes up
smiling. Not since 1923 has
the University of California
mentor had the pleasure of
taking home a Cig Meet vic
tory. This year it looks like
Christie will again come out
on the short' end. One thing,
he does keep on trying in the
face of almost negligible track
material.

WHAT AN ARM!
You have to hand to this
boy when it comes to tossing
Greek weapons around the
'lawn—or anywhere else for
that matter. Templeton does
not even pray for a first in the
javelin with Ken Churchill
hanging around the landscape.
He only throws the implement
a mere 217 feet, which is good
in any kind of weather. Look
for a new record tomorrow.

javelin with Ken Churchill
hanging around the landscape.
He only throws the implement
a mere 217 feet, which is good
in any kind of weather. Look

THIRD'S A CHARM
v Pitcher Norm Horner 1 lost
couple of games this year
after six wins in two years
s. but the Bear infield gave him
s-little support. Also the hanks
rin Stanford's outfield may
ihnve disconcerted him. But
.the Indians will need more
, than axe-handles tomorrow.

HE GATHERS NO MOSS
Does this sorrel topped individual to our
left, but he has acquired a very high polish
however while running a mile or two for
his Alma Mater. Captain Spud Mossman is
Christie's super threat and ought to take
either the mile or two-mile or both. Crown
will furnish him plenty of competition in
the former and Aebersold in the latter.

ELECTRICAL
That's the effect of the young man below
on Crick Morse, but he's just a firefly to
the Card sprinters. Spencer Sparks is a
good man, though, and may prove too good
for Dyer, I fables, and Lombardi in the ecu-'
tury tomorrow. He is not quite so fast in
the furlong.

A FAST MAN
But Bill Strom of the University of
California isn't fast enough, liis team
mate Sparks will cut him out of any point
the Bears will take in the sprints tomor
row. He's not expected to place, with
Dyer, Hables, Lombardi to contend with,
let alone his speedy rival from his own
university. But you never can tell; he
may figure in the scoring column.

HURDLER
Is. Mister Lowell Bond
shu of the Golden Hears,
but the Cards are against
him tomorrow — Smith,
Nisbet, and Herbert. This
trio ought to place plenty
of splinters in Bondshu's
alley. He.may or may not
grab a point or so for Cali
fornia—probably not.

RENARD LOOKS 'EM OVER
Glenn S coble Warner, the slip
pery genius of the gridiron,-takes a
squint down the line at the powers
behind the throne —of King Foot
ball. In order he sees Jimmy Che
lan, Washington ; ".Headman" Jones,
l.S.CV; Bill Ingram, California,
Fritz Crisler, Minnesota, and Jack
Cannell, Dartmouth, all of whom he
will face this fall.

BLUE MENTOR
Who wouldn't be? Since
1919 Walt Christie has bowed
to the inevitable. Cut win or
lose the dean of the Pacific
Coast track coaches comes up
smiling. Not since 1923 has
the University of California
mentor had the pleasure of
taking home a Cig Meet vic
tory. This year it looks like
Christie will again come out
on the short' end. One thing,
he does keep on trying in the
face of almost negligible track
material.

WHAT AN ARM!
You have to hand to this
boy when it comes to tossing
Greek weapons around the
'lawn—or anywhere else for
that matter. Templeton does
not even pray for a first in the
javelin with Ken Churchill
hanging around the landscape.
He only throws the implement
a mere 217 feet, which is good
in any kind of weather. Look
for a new record tomorrow.
