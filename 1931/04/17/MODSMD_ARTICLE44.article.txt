## 
### MICHAEL CROFOOT 
Introducing Abe and Ike Hables,
trackmen extraordinary, who put on
their famous brother act under the
direction of Dink Templeton with
the Stanford Stadium as their stage
and scarlet and white track suits as
their costume this Saturday.
Track enthusiasts, destroyers of
records, great competitotrs, Olympic
prospects, bringers of joy to Tem
pleton and consternation to Chris
tie, they have carved out for them
selves in one year a permanent
niche in the Stanford hall of fame.
Abe Runs Three
Abe (or Les), who is the older
and more versatile of the two, runs
the 100-, 220-, and 440-yard dashes,
all of them in the same meet if
need be. Ike concentrates on the
quarter-mile.
Abe has stepped the 100 in 9.6
seconds, the 220 in 20.9, and the
440 in 48.6. Ike was clocked in 48.8
in winning the quarter-mile at the
California intercollegiates last spring.
Both Are Winners
Les has repeatedly beaten "Hur
rying Hector" Dyer, conqueror of
Wykoff, in practice meets, but has
never been able to beat the "Glen
dale Flash" in person. He has even
finished ahead of Ben Eastman in
a quarter-mile race.
Ike has victories in the 440 to his
credit over Talbot Hartley of Wash
ington and U.S.C.'s Vic Williams,
the present national champion.
King City Products
Both Hables began their track ac
tivities at King City High School.
As their representative in the state
meet, Los took second to Wykoff in

! the two sprints for two years. Al
! though he (entered Stanford two
! years ago, he not been eligible
ito represent the Indians until this
: year because of scholastic difficul
| ties, but he has made his mark
| nevertheless.
j Competing in the intramural and
| interclass meets, he established rec
| ords for his three specialties of 10
| flat, 21:3, and 49.8 seconds, which
| will stand for a long time,
j At present he forms with Dyer
I and Lombardi probably the best trio
! of collegiate sprinters ever on one
| team.
Ike a Former Sprinter
| Coming to Stanford as a 10.1
I sprinter, Ike Hables was converted
| into a quarter-miler by 'Templeton
i and justified the "Boy Coach's"
| judgment by setting up a new "Lit
| tie Big Meet" record of 50.4 seconds.
Last year he further justified it
j by placing in every dual meet and
! filling Johnny Morrison's shoes in
i the California intercollegiates.
This year he is gaining glory as a
i member of the relay team and a
| bang-up second to the phenomenal'
' Eastman.

' Eastman.
Introducing Abe and Ike Hables,
trackmen extraordinary, who put on
their famous brother act under the
direction of Dink Templeton with
the Stanford Stadium as their stage
and scarlet and white track suits as
their costume this Saturday.
Track enthusiasts, destroyers of
records, great competitotrs, Olympic
prospects, bringers of joy to Tem
pleton and consternation to Chris
tie, they have carved out for them
selves in one year a permanent
niche in the Stanford hall of fame.
Abe Runs Three
Abe (or Les), who is the older
and more versatile of the two, runs
the 100-, 220-, and 440-yard dashes,
all of them in the same meet if
need be. Ike concentrates on the
quarter-mile.
Abe has stepped the 100 in 9.6
seconds, the 220 in 20.9, and the
440 in 48.6. Ike was clocked in 48.8
in winning the quarter-mile at the
California intercollegiates last spring.
Both Are Winners
Les has repeatedly beaten "Hur
rying Hector" Dyer, conqueror of
Wykoff, in practice meets, but has
never been able to beat the "Glen
dale Flash" in person. He has even
finished ahead of Ben Eastman in
a quarter-mile race.
Ike has victories in the 440 to his
credit over Talbot Hartley of Wash
ington and U.S.C.'s Vic Williams,
the present national champion.
King City Products
Both Hables began their track ac
tivities at King City High School.
As their representative in the state
meet, Los took second to Wykoff in

! the two sprints for two years. Al
! though he (entered Stanford two
! years ago, he not been eligible
ito represent the Indians until this
: year because of scholastic difficul
| ties, but he has made his mark
| nevertheless.
j Competing in the intramural and
| interclass meets, he established rec
| ords for his three specialties of 10
| flat, 21:3, and 49.8 seconds, which
| will stand for a long time,
j At present he forms with Dyer
I and Lombardi probably the best trio
! of collegiate sprinters ever on one
| team.
Ike a Former Sprinter
| Coming to Stanford as a 10.1
I sprinter, Ike Hables was converted
| into a quarter-miler by 'Templeton
i and justified the "Boy Coach's"
| judgment by setting up a new "Lit
| tie Big Meet" record of 50.4 seconds.
Last year he further justified it
j by placing in every dual meet and
! filling Johnny Morrison's shoes in
i the California intercollegiates.
This year he is gaining glory as a
i member of the relay team and a
| bang-up second to the phenomenal'
' Eastman.
