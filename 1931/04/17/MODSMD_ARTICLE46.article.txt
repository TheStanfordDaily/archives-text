# CARDINAL NET TEAM TO FACE CALIFORNIA WITH CLEAN RECORD
## 
### 
All set for tomorrow's big Bear
tennis encounter, the local men en
ter competition with a clean record
| behind them. Highly successful so
| fhr this season, the Indians have
| chalked up four conference victories
with the loss of but four matches,
j Making their season debut against
U.C.L.A. March 26 on the Southern
I courts, the classy Card outfit cap
tured seven out of the nine tilts,
j dropping only one singles and one
I doubles.
Turning to U.S.C. the next day,
| Easton's crew buckled down to
| business and emerged with another
{ seven to two win.
Overwhelming to an even greater
: degree were the encounters held on
the campus April 3 and 4 against
the same two teams. Out of 18
matches, comprising 37 sets, but one
set was lost! Everything worked to
perfection in gaining clean-sweep
results.
Meeting U.C.L.A. first, the local
i netmen not only lost even a single
j set, but were neither carried to a
! deuce set at any time. Again facing
U.S.C. on the local courts next day,
the expert Indian racket-wielders
scored another clean sweep, this
time, however, with the loss of one
set.
Captain Easton's squad has cer
tainly earned plenty of credit so far
this season, and hopes to keep a
clean slate when the Bear comes
within range tomorrow.
