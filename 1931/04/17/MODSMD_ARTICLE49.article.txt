SPUD MOSSMAN—"Regardless of the score last Saturday, California
was good for 50 points against the Trojans, and the Trojans are that much j
better than Stanford. I think we can take Stanford Saturday. We should ;
pile up a score of 69-62. It will depend on the team. If they keep their j
heads up, we will win the meet.
PODGE SMITH—"California is reputed to have the best track team
in years, but we hope to set a new Big Meet record this year. We should
better the 1929 record by at least two points. I think the best events of i
he day will be the distance races, especially jtlie two-mile."
