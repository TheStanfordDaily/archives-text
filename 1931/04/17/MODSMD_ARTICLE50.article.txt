# PODGE SMITH WAS ONCE WORLD'S WORST HURDLER, COACH TEMPLETON BELIEVES
## 
### 
When Rogers (Podge) Smith first
tried out for the freshman track
team in the fall of 1927, it was his
coach's expressed opinion that he
was the worst prospect for varsity
material that ever appeared on the
Stanford oval. During his sophomore
year, in track mid-season, that same
coach wrote of him as the most im
proved athlete that had ever graced
Stanford athletics.
That's the story of today's Cap
tain Smith of the Stanford varsity:
the coast's premier college hurdler.
In high school, he was a nobody as
far as track was concerned. He tried
out, of course, and sometimes com
peted; in fact, he once ran a high
hurdle race in 16:8, which is pretty
close to high-jumping each hurdle
even for high-school runners.
As a freshman, Podge was lucky
to find a lot of great hurdlers whose
style he might study but against
whom he did not have to compete
because they were ahead of him in
school: Ross Nichols, Clarence West,
and Ward Edmonds. As a result, he
was able to edge in with a couple of
seconds in the California freshman
meet of that year; the second in the
low hurdles, by the way, was to Hec
Dyer, who took 15 points in that
meet.

: As a sophomore, Smith ran behind
' Captain Nichols in the highs and
[ behind Ward Edmonds in the lows,
! and earned the name of most-im
| proved-athlete.
Last year, his junior tear, Podge
1 gave a miniature of his entire ath
letic career, starting off poorly and
| finishing in a blaze of glory. In the
| Big Meet, he hit the second hurdle
! and, though able to finish, could not
j even fight with his chief rival, Cap
tain Pogolotti, for first place. In the
U.S.C. meet, he tied with Jeddy
'Welch in 15 flat. In the California
! Intercollegiates, however, he got his
i revenge, taking a neat first place and
I getting over every hurdle cleanly,
i As captain this spring, Smith has
i shown himself to be worthy of a
place in the ranks of Stanford's great
! hurdlers.
