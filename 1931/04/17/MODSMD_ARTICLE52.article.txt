### A BARBECUE, FOLKS 
When a football game de
generates into a complete rout,
fans are wont to call it a track
meet. Yet a track meet remains
a track meet, whether it be a
closely contested affair or a
wholesale slaughter. Since to
morrow's Big Meet is a cinch to
be of the latter variety, doping
the outcome is of no particular
interest. Hence spectators look
to individual duels for thrills,
while a broken record always
comes in for a generous amount
of excitement.
<$> ,; f 4
One common custom is due to go
by the boards tomorrow. During the
entire hour and a half that is re
quired to run off even the best of
track meets, there is no period of
relaxation corresponding to the
half-time rest of a football contest.
This is due, evidently, to an over
sight on the part of Hermes and the
rest of the boys in originating the
ancient pastime way back when
Greek gods wPre more than a maid
en's prayer.
4 4 4,
The Great American Sporting
Public, quick to sec the advan
tage offered by the 10-minute
two-mile grind, adopted the
practice of going out for a cup
of coffee and a hot dog at the
start of the eight-lap misery, re
turning in time to witness the
finish. But when Paul Aebersoid
toes the mark tomorrow against
California's "Iron Man," Captain
Spud Mossman, fans with a
taste for the better things in
track competition will remain in
their seats, only to rise out of
them in the excitement of the
battle which is certain to de
velop.
4 4 4
If Mossman does not run the mile
earlier in the afternoon, he will be a
favorite to beat Templeton's newly
developed star. Generally conceded
to be capable of better than 9:40,
the Bear leader will be facing an
athlete whose best mark is 9:42.6.
Should Spud have four laps of fast
running behind him when the gun
sounds starting the two-mile, Aeber
soid will be a cinch. However, both
have the pluck, the heart, and the
spirit to do or die. It'll be a great
race. And don't forget to watch
Aebersoid tantalizing his opponent
on the turns!
4 4 4
Speaking of Big Meet records,
several will be resting on very
feeble foundations tomorrow.
The Indians will probably fall
two or three points short of the
record high score, 94 2-3. But
the 9.8 hundred mark has been
bettered already this season by
three of tomorrow's sprinters,
Hec Dyer, Les Hables, and Spen
cer Sparks, while every man of
the same trio has equalled the
21.4 record furlong.
4 <♦ 4
Ben Eastman is a threat to
erase the 4S flat quarter-mile
time, Mossman or Aebersoid to
beat the 9:38.2 two-mile,
Churchill to blot out his own
209 ft. 7VH in. javelin record, and
Stanford to break the relay time
of 3:18.7.
<4 4 4
Whether Spencer Sparks can break
up the one-two finish of Hec Dyer
and Les Hables in the dashes will
he the pertinent question of the
hour for some thousands of Berke
leyites who will invade the Stadium
Saturday. Personally, we feel that
Mr. Sparks has an excellent chance
of coming in fourth in both events,
though he may surprise by coming
through this year. '
4 4 4
It's going to be heartbreaking
to witness Saturday's butchery,
mates, heartbreaking. When the
long afternoon shadows begin to
creep across the Stadium turf,
it'll just be another "Poor Cal."

The Great American Sporting
Public, quick to sec the advan
tage offered by the 10-minute
two-mile grind, adopted the
practice of going out for a cup
of coffee and a hot dog at the
start of the eight-lap misery, re
turning in time to witness the
finish. But when Paul Aebersoid
toes the mark tomorrow against
California's "Iron Man," Captain
Spud Mossman, fans with a
taste for the better things in
track competition will remain in
their seats, only to rise out of
them in the excitement of the
battle which is certain to de
velop.
4 4 4
If Mossman does not run the mile
earlier in the afternoon, he will be a
favorite to beat Templeton's newly
developed star. Generally conceded
to be capable of better than 9:40,
the Bear leader will be facing an
athlete whose best mark is 9:42.6.
Should Spud have four laps of fast
running behind him when the gun
sounds starting the two-mile, Aeber
soid will be a cinch. However, both
have the pluck, the heart, and the
spirit to do or die. It'll be a great
race. And don't forget to watch
Aebersoid tantalizing his opponent
on the turns!

Speaking of Big Meet records,
several will be resting on very
feeble foundations tomorrow.
The Indians will probably fall
two or three points short of the
record high score, 94 2-3. But
the 9.8 hundred mark has been
bettered already this season by
three of tomorrow's sprinters,
Hec Dyer, Les Hables, and Spen
cer Sparks, while every man of
the same trio has equalled the
21.4 record furlong.
4 <♦ 4
Ben Eastman is a threat to
erase the 4S flat quarter-mile
time, Mossman or Aebersoid to
beat the 9:38.2 two-mile,
Churchill to blot out his own
209 ft. 7VH in. javelin record, and
Stanford to break the relay time
of 3:18.7.
<4 4 4
Whether Spencer Sparks can break
up the one-two finish of Hec Dyer
and Les Hables in the dashes will
he the pertinent question of the
hour for some thousands of Berke
leyites who will invade the Stadium
Saturday. Personally, we feel that
Mr. Sparks has an excellent chance
of coming in fourth in both events,
though he may surprise by coming
through this year. '
4 4 4
It's going to be heartbreaking
to witness Saturday's butchery,
mates, heartbreaking. When the
long afternoon shadows begin to
creep across the Stadium turf,
it'll just be another "Poor Cal."
When a football game de
generates into a complete rout,
fans are wont to call it a track
meet. Yet a track meet remains
a track meet, whether it be a
closely contested affair or a
wholesale slaughter. Since to
morrow's Big Meet is a cinch to
be of the latter variety, doping
the outcome is of no particular
interest. Hence spectators look
to individual duels for thrills,
while a broken record always
comes in for a generous amount
of excitement.

One common custom is due to go
by the boards tomorrow. During the
entire hour and a half that is re
quired to run off even the best of
track meets, there is no period of
relaxation corresponding to the
half-time rest of a football contest.
This is due, evidently, to an over
sight on the part of Hermes and the
