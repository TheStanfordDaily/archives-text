# INDIANS FACE TROJAN TRACKMEN HERE MAY 2
## Warner Likes 1931 Gridiron Outlook HEAVY SCHEDULE FOLLOWS ANNUAL CALIFORNIA MEET State Intercollegiates At L.A., Fresno Relays, I.C.4-A. Coming Up 
### Jack Jernegan 
Coach Dink Templeton and his
thinly clad track athletes may not
have a great deal of difficulty in
surmounting the hurdle offered to
morrow by California's bc-ar, but the
far-famed Cardinal chieftain and
the ambitious Indians will not be
able to rest on their laurels after
the Big Meet. Far from it.
After tomorrow's engagement the
first event on the program is the
annual Pacific Association meet, to
be held in Kezar Stadium, San Fran
cisco, one week later. Then comes
the inevitable struggle with the
haughty hordes of Ilium, the formid
able U.S.C. Trojans, who will invade
the campus on May 2, two weeks
from tomorrow.
Three May Meets
Following the Trojan meet, Stan
ford's hard-working trackmen will
travel down to Fresno for the Fresno
Relays on May 9, returning to the
Farm in time to start South for the
California Intercollegiates in Los
Angeles May 16. A few days' rest,
and then Templeton and his cohorts
will set off on a transcontinental
journey to Philadelphia where they
will endeavor to collect a fourth
I.C.A.A.A.A. title on May 30.
Few campus enthusiasts have for
gotten the 84-47 defeat which the
Redshirts took at the hands of U.S.C.
last year. That was the worst beat
ing a Stanford track team has re
ceived for these many years, and no
one felt very happy about it, even
though the relay team cracked the
intercollegiate record and Hec Dyer
beat Frank Wykoff.
Close Score Certain
This year there won't be any one
sided score on either side. In fact,
at the present moment all of the
sharks are trying to guess whether
Stanford or U.S.C. v/ill win 66-65.
A dope sheet based on performances
so far this season will give either
result, depending on whether the
writer favors a Stanford man who
can run the fifty-fifty in umpty-ump
seconds, or prefers a Trojan who
makes the same time for the same
distance.
Up to this year, Dink Templeton
holds an eight-to-two margin over
U.S.C. in number of dual meet vic
tories. The possibility of making it
nine to two probably rests upon the
efficacy of the unexpected maneu
vers which Dink can make to upset
the balance of scoring power.
Already the wise boys are plan
ning his moves; Les Hables in the
j 440 and relay, Eastman in the 440
, and 880, Storms in the two-mile,
| Sam Eastman in the mile, and so on.
I Probably Templeton himself doesn't
know yet what he will do on May 2,
but it is a cinch that there will be
some surprises. It is also certain that
Dean Cromwell, Trojan coach, will
pull a few tricks of his own. One
of his dark horses came to light last
! Saturday in the shape of Earl Calla
han, a mile and two-mile runner.
But as you file out of the old
bowl with tear-clouded eyes,
remember that there is a ball
game starting nearby, a glori
ous ball game, which means
more to Stanford diamond his
i tory than any ever has. Answer
the call of "Horner versus John
son," and see the titanic struggle
of the ages! —Crawford

gotten the 84-47 defeat which the
Redshirts took at the hands of U.S.C.
last year. That was the worst beat
ing a Stanford track team has re
ceived for these many years, and no
one felt very happy about it, even
though the relay team cracked the
intercollegiate record and Hec Dyer
beat Frank Wykoff.
Close Score Certain
This year there won't be any one
sided score on either side. In fact,
at the present moment all of the
sharks are trying to guess whether
Stanford or U.S.C. v/ill win 66-65.
A dope sheet based on performances
so far this season will give either
result, depending on whether the
writer favors a Stanford man who
can run the fifty-fifty in umpty-ump
seconds, or prefers a Trojan who
makes the same time for the same
distance.
Up to this year, Dink Templeton
holds an eight-to-two margin over
U.S.C. in number of dual meet vic
tories. The possibility of making it
nine to two probably rests upon the
efficacy of the unexpected maneu
vers which Dink can make to upset
the balance of scoring power.
Already the wise boys are plan
ning his moves; Les Hables in the
j 440 and relay, Eastman in the 440
, and 880, Storms in the two-mile,
| Sam Eastman in the mile, and so on.
I Probably Templeton himself doesn't
know yet what he will do on May 2,
but it is a cinch that there will be
some surprises. It is also certain that
Dean Cromwell, Trojan coach, will
pull a few tricks of his own. One
of his dark horses came to light last
! Saturday in the shape of Earl Calla
han, a mile and two-mile runner.
But as you file out of the old
bowl with tear-clouded eyes,
remember that there is a ball
game starting nearby, a glori
ous ball game, which means
more to Stanford diamond his
i tory than any ever has. Answer
the call of "Horner versus John
son," and see the titanic struggle
of the ages! —Crawford
Coach Dink Templeton and his
thinly clad track athletes may not
have a great deal of difficulty in
surmounting the hurdle offered to
morrow by California's bc-ar, but the
far-famed Cardinal chieftain and
the ambitious Indians will not be
able to rest on their laurels after
the Big Meet. Far from it.
After tomorrow's engagement the
first event on the program is the
annual Pacific Association meet, to
be held in Kezar Stadium, San Fran
cisco, one week later. Then comes
the inevitable struggle with the
haughty hordes of Ilium, the formid
able U.S.C. Trojans, who will invade
the campus on May 2, two weeks
from tomorrow.
Three May Meets
Following the Trojan meet, Stan
ford's hard-working trackmen will
travel down to Fresno for the Fresno
Relays on May 9, returning to the
Farm in time to start South for the
California Intercollegiates in Los
Angeles May 16. A few days' rest,
and then Templeton and his cohorts
will set off on a transcontinental
journey to Philadelphia where they
will endeavor to collect a fourth
I.C.A.A.A.A. title on May 30.
