# CALIFORNIA CAPTAIN STARTS GRIND
## 
### 

Here is "Spud"
Mossman, U.C.
track leader, as
he appeared at
the start of a recent
two - mile
run, his favorite
event.
The Bear captain
may run the
mile too, and if
so, he may have a
hard time heating
Aebersold. Watch
them tomorrow
as they take the
turns.
