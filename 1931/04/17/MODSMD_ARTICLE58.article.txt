# BEAR IRON MAN IN TWO EVENTS
## Mossman, Hero Last Year Hopes To Duplicate Double Victory 
### 
* Everett "Spud" Mossman, besides
i being captain of the California track
I team that meets Stanford tomorrow,
; runs a two-mile that constitutes one
Iof the major threats of the meet.
I Mcssman's "iron man" stunt, which
I he intends to repeat tomorrow —that
i is running the two-mile and the mile
| within half an hour of each other
i and v/inning them both, made him
the hero of last year's Big Meett.
This sand-red head comes from
j Idaho, where they build them husky,
j This is his fourth year at California
and his third participation in a Big
Meet. He is rather short and tightly
: knit. He is retiring and extremely
difficult to interview, as he will not
, talk about himself.
Wins From U.S.C.
Last Saturday he romped away
] with the two-mile during the Cali
| fornia-U.S.C. meet (9:49.3). It is
; generally conceded that he can break
| 9:30 any time he feels like it and
I that he is one of the best endurance
| men in the country.
Paul Aebersoid, who will race
j against him tomorrow, has not really
j been pushed this season and it re
| mains to be seen how he will stack
| up against Mossman. Aebersoid fin
ished a yard behind Elmo in the
L.A.A.C. meet two weeks ago
(9:42.6), while Mossman earlier in
the season led Elmo by five yards
(9:47).
Always Shows Gameness
No one doubts Spud's gameness.
Winning or losing, he stretches out
for the tape with the same deter
i mination, his easy rhythmic stride
carrying him persistently forward,
j He is an inspiration and an example
for his team.
He has a good memory for faces
1 and greets his friends with a short
characteristic salutation. From child
hood he has been endowed with
; those elements go to make for
success on the track—physical
strength, endurance, charming per
sonality, lack of egotism, and above
all, determination.

* Everett "Spud" Mossman, besides
i being captain of the California track
I team that meets Stanford tomorrow,
; runs a two-mile that constitutes one
Iof the major threats of the meet.
I Mcssman's "iron man" stunt, which
I he intends to repeat tomorrow —that
i is running the two-mile and the mile
| within half an hour of each other
i and v/inning them both, made him
the hero of last year's Big Meett.
This sand-red head comes from
j Idaho, where they build them husky,
j This is his fourth year at California
and his third participation in a Big
Meet. He is rather short and tightly
: knit. He is retiring and extremely
difficult to interview, as he will not
, talk about himself.
Wins From U.S.C.
Last Saturday he romped away
] with the two-mile during the Cali
| fornia-U.S.C. meet (9:49.3). It is
; generally conceded that he can break
| 9:30 any time he feels like it and
I that he is one of the best endurance
| men in the country.
Paul Aebersoid, who will race
j against him tomorrow, has not really
j been pushed this season and it re
| mains to be seen how he will stack
| up against Mossman. Aebersoid fin
ished a yard behind Elmo in the
L.A.A.C. meet two weeks ago
(9:42.6), while Mossman earlier in
the season led Elmo by five yards
(9:47).
Always Shows Gameness
No one doubts Spud's gameness.
Winning or losing, he stretches out
for the tape with the same deter
i mination, his easy rhythmic stride
carrying him persistently forward,
j He is an inspiration and an example
for his team.
