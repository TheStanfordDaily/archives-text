# STRONG FOWARD ILL SHOULD AID CARDS NEXT FALL
## Loss Of Rothert, Simkins, Fails To Worry 'Pop'; Backs Plentiful 
### Lowell Cox 
; While careful not to express too
much optimism, Coach Pop Warner
believes that the football outlook for
next fali is at least as bright as it
I was last season, with the possibility
! that the line v/ill be considerably
| stronger.
"Things look about the same as
| last year at this time," Warner told
| the writer this week, "perhaps a lit
i tie better. The line, which was our
real weakness last season, may be
quite a bit stronger."
In spite of the loss of Harlow
j Rothert and Bill Simkins, the Old
! Man does not seem particularly per
j turbed about the fullback situation.
May Move Caddel
"We have plenty of backs," War
! ner said. "The quarterback and full
! back positions being interchange -
| able, Hillman will of course fill one
|of them. As for the other, I may
I move Caddel back from half. He's
| heavier this season—nearly 200
i pounds—and he's had experience at
| full.
| "Then there's Rintala. He is too
! good a man just to be understudy
i to Moffatt. I may shift him to right
| half, or try him at fullback.
I "Phil Baker is another fellow who
is coming along nicely. He was good
last year, and is showing improve
ment. 'Dusty' Allen is another fuil
; back prospect, as is Targhetta."
The halfbacks are the least of
Pop's worries. Besides Phil Moffatt,
| flashy ail-American of last season,
there are Rintala, Caddel, Hardy,
Lambert, Glover, and others.
Line Prospects Good
I Both Warner and "Tiny" Thorn
hill, line coach, seem pleased with
, the prospects for the forward wall.
The loss of Mar Albertson, whom
the scholarship committee has de
: ciared ineligible for next season, will
i of course be felt at center.
But Warner, seemingly unworried,
jis developing several new pivot
j men. Johnny Hancock, fullback on
last year's goof team, is being
: groomed for center, as is Kite, a
guard last season. Warner pointed
I out that Hancock's size will be valu
! able in the center of the line, while
his fullback experience stand
j him in good stead in backing up the
I line when occasion demands. Marks,
a substitute last year, and Milligan,
up from the greys, are other leading
candidates.
Expects Two Centers
"I expect to get a couple of good
centers out of the lot of them," War
! ner commented.
As for the rest of the forward
i wall, there is plenty of material,
| with experienced men returning to
i every position.
