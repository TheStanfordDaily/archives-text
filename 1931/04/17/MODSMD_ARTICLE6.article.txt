# CHAPARRAL TOOTS ANNIVERSARY HORN
## 
### 
Hammer and Coffin Society today
celebrates its Silver Anniversary
with the appearance on Quad of the
best issue of Chaparral in the whole
25 years. Feeling benevolent, the
Old Boy is selling it for the same
old two-bits a copy.
Gregor Duncan is the apple of this
month's editorial eye with two
pages of sketches of campus beau
ties. Ned Hilton, former Chaparral
staff artist, has also contributed a
couple of nice drawings.
According to tradition, the found
ing of Hammer and Coffin Society
caused the 1906 earthquake. The ed
itor hopes that the release of this
issue will not start another.
