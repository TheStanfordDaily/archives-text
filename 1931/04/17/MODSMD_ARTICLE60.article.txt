# CHRISTIE'S BEAR TRACKMEN SHOW FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE IN MEETS
## California Team Defeats Junior Collegians, Olympic Club, Washington; Drops Meet to L.A.A.C. 
### FRITZ GOODWIN 
j Coach Walt Christie's Bear track
season thus far has progressed
j something after the fashion of that
! popular Fourth of July article, the
j Roman candle. Starting the early
! training season as an ordinary squad,
! the California trackmen soon broke
J out with a brilliant display of fire
| works which presaged a strong cin-
I der-path team for the Berkeley in
| stitution.
The fireworks lasted until last
! Saturday, when they suddenly fiz
zled out against the Trojans in Los
Angeles. But Coach Christie still
has the candle pointed aloft, and
interested bystanders are wonder-
I ing if there is another hall of fire
j remaining to be discharged tomor
i row, when the Blue and Gold in
i vades the Farm.
Down J.C. Stars
| In thfe first intercollegiate compe
j titjon of the year on March 14,
| against a team of junior college all
! stars, Christie's men gave promise
i of their individual brilliance. Cali
| fornia won the meet, 108 x /2 to 13Vz,
! but the cheering features to Berke
; ley fans were the performances of
| Pool, Sparks, and Mossman.
j Pool tied for first in the pole vault
| with Miller of Menlo at a height he
j had never before reached, 13 feet 5 x /2
j inches. Sparks won the 100 and 200-
i yard dashes in the excellent early
| season times of 9.9 and 19.4 seconds,
| and Captain Spud Mossman ran a
| good mile, 4 minutes 35.1 seconds.
Winged "O" Defeated
A week later the U.C. outfit looked
| good in defeating the Olympic Club,
j81 to 50. Sparks had shaded his
| century mark to 9.8 seconds, defeat
j ing Cy Leland, former Texas star.
! Pool and Vantress tied for first in
I the vault at 13 feet 3y 2 inches. De-
Berry put the shot 48 feet, and
; Champion Ken Churchill was toss
! ing the javelin regularly past the
j 200-foot marker.
The defeat by L.A.A.C., 85 1-3 to
45 2-3, although expected, was no
; disappointment to Berkeley, for Pool
! soared high to tie with Barnes,
: world record holder, at 13 feet 11
I inches. DeBerry's best put was 48
i feet 9 inches, and Mossman and
: Zellman were in fine shape in the

half and two-mile.
On April 4 California showed its
greatest strength in downing the
Washington Huskies, 78 to 53.
Churchill set a new Coast collegiate
mark in the javelin, 217 feet 7 inches.
Sparks was down to 9.7 seconds ip
the 100, and Mossmdn ran two miles
in 9:46.2.
Then the Trojans applied the pro
verbial wet blanket, swamping the
Bears 103 to 28. Pool could do no
better than tie for second at 12 feet
6 inches, and DeBerry took a sud
den drop to 46 feet SVe inches in
the shot. Only Mossman and Chur
chill turned in their usual feats,
winning the only two California
first places.

j Pool tied for first in the pole vault

j had never before reached, 13 feet 5 x /2
j inches. Sparks won the 100 and 200-
i yard dashes in the excellent early

| and Captain Spud Mossman ran a
| good mile, 4 minutes 35.1 seconds.

j81 to 50. Sparks had shaded his
| century mark to 9.8 seconds, defeat
j ing Cy Leland, former Texas star.
! Pool and Vantress tied for first in
I the vault at 13 feet 3y 2 inches. De-
Berry put the shot 48 feet, and
; Champion Ken Churchill was toss
! ing the javelin regularly past the
j 200-foot marker.
The defeat by L.A.A.C., 85 1-3 to
45 2-3, although expected, was no
; disappointment to Berkeley, for Pool
! soared high to tie with Barnes,
: world record holder, at 13 feet 11
I inches. DeBerry's best put was 48
i feet 9 inches, and Mossman and
: Zellman were in fine shape in the

half and two-mile.
On April 4 California showed its
greatest strength in downing the
Washington Huskies, 78 to 53.
Churchill set a new Coast collegiate
mark in the javelin, 217 feet 7 inches.
Sparks was down to 9.7 seconds ip
the 100, and Mossmdn ran two miles
in 9:46.2.
Then the Trojans applied the pro
verbial wet blanket, swamping the
Bears 103 to 28. Pool could do no
better than tie for second at 12 feet
6 inches, and DeBerry took a sud
den drop to 46 feet SVe inches in
the shot. Only Mossman and Chur
chill turned in their usual feats,
winning the only two California
first places.
