# Stanford Golfers 'Greatest In History'
## BENNETT-TRAINED TEAM VICTORIOUS IN EVERY MATCH Oregon Only Team Not Yet Conquered By Local Club-Swingers 
### Mike Crofoot 
With a wealth of material to draw
from and the -fine University course
for practice purposes, Coach Garry
Bennett has turned out this year the
greatest golf team ever to represent
Stanford.
Its members have brushed aside
all collegiate opposition with the
greatest of ease to win every indi
vidual and team honor of the south
ern section of the Pacific Coast Golf
Conference. Only Oregon, northern
section champion, stands between
the Indians and the Pacific coast
title.
Carnival Victory
Typifying the way in which oppo
sition has been steamrolled are the
Stanford victories in golf over Cali
fornia, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A. in the
Minor Sports carnival, held April 7
and 8 at the Stanford course. Win
ning the team title by 23 strokes and
qualifying the first four men for the
individual championship, the In
dians made the first day of the tour
nament decidedly a red letter one.
Stanford's total was 613. U.S.C. was
second with 636 and California was
third with 639.
Because of his victory in the tour
nament with a score of 151, Malcolm
MacNaughton has a chance to meet
Don Moe, northern title holder, for
the coast crown, at the same time
the championship matches are to be
played.
Beat Bears â€¢
In Stanford's annual dual meet
with California last month, the In
dians took an 18-9 decision. Mac-
Naughton, Eichelberger, Goldwater,
and Kawley all bested their oppo
nents handily.
Most of the Indian team took part
in the Del Monte Intercollegiate
tourney early in February, which
was won by Harry Eichelberger.
Stuart Hawley was runner-up.
Strengthened by the addition of
Lav/son Little, Charles Seaver and
Jerry "Trautman, the freshman tri
umvirate, Stanford's golfing legion
qualified six men in the Northern
California golf championship last
week-end and at present four of
them are in the quarter finals.
Such is the record of Stanford's
collection of crack club swingers. It
speaks for itself.
