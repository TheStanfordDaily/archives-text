# Templeton Has One Of Greatest Squads
## 1931 Model Track Machine Wins From Washington And Olympics; Loses Close Meet to L.A.A.C. 
### 
Faced with the less of the two
premier field event competitors in
Stanford's track history, Rothertand
Krenz, at the start of the present
season, Coach Dink Templeton has
built up a 1931 organization that is
potentially capable of greater suc
cess than last year's.
Bob Jones, Nellie Gray, George
Grey, Here Laborde, and Norm Mc-
Leod have stepped into the shoes of
Rothert and Krenz, niaking an even
stronger weight unit than that which
harbored Stanford's two champions.
Jones in Discus
Jones is still 10 feet short of
Krenz' best discus mark, at 157 feet,
but he is easily the best man in this
event on the Pacific slope, while the
other four men are all around 145
feet, a point winning distance in al
most any dual Competition.
Nellie Gray has put the shot 48
feet 11 inches this season, the best
mark on the collegiate 1931 slate, and
George Grey and Laborde are usu
ally certain of a toss of 48 feet or
better. Stanford's first javelin threat
since Sparling has been developed
in A1 Ray, who has reached 200 feet
in practice.
On the track the story is just about
the same as last year, except that
the present squad is strengthened by
the presence of Les Hables, Ben
Eastman, Paul Aebersold, and Frank
Lombardi. Hec Dyer in the sprints
and Captain Podge Smith in the hur
dles, consistent point winners last
season, are back at their old events.
The arrival of Hables and East
man on the varsity oval bids fair to
mark another era in Stanford track
history. Eastman is without doubt
the fastest man on the Coast in
either the 440 or 880, although his

! competitive reaction has not yet
j been severely tested.
! Hables can easily run right along
| side Dyer in both sprints, and he is
' second only to Eastman on the In
j' dian squad in the quarter. His ver
satility is admirably suited to Tem
| pleton's event juggling methods in
; close dual meets.
Beat Winged "O"
I The Olympic Club came down to
I the Farm on March 7 for the first
: meet of the season and went back
|to San Francisco with a 881-2 to
1421-2 defeat. Eastman ran away
| from the field to win the 440 in the
; remarkable early season time of
I 48.4 seconds. Since that time he has
made 48 flat in practice.
Jones threw the discuss 157 feet
! 6 3-4 inches against the Winged "O",
and Gray made his 48 feet 11 inches
j in the shot that day. Aebersold won
a sensational two-mile race in the
| fine time of 9:53.8, and Smith and
Dyel looked like their old selves in
I winning two first places apiece.
Huskies Subdued
j On March 28 Templeton's men
j drubbed the Washington Huskies at
j Seattle, 87 to 44, in a meet featured
i by the setting of six new Washing
ton oval records. Dyer, Eastman,
Aebersold, Jones, and the Indian re
lay team were responsible for five
of the marks. Burt DeGroot vaulted
13 feet to win the pole event.
Then on April 4 a few things went
wrong at Los Angeles, and Dink's
team lest to the Athletic Club of
I that city, 70 to 61. Dyer, after win
i ning the century, did not enter the
j 220; Nisbet, running second, fell on
! the last barrier in the low hurdles;
j and the Stanford weight men failed
[to function up to form.
