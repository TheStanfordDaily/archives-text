# CARD POLO TEAM OVERWHELMS S.C. BY 12-GOAL COUNT
## Booth Drives Five Scores Through Posts From 
### Back Position 
Led by the hard-hitting Pod
Boothe who scored five goals from
the back position, the Stanford sec
ond-string polo team yesterday de
feated the Trojans by the over
whelming count of 12-0. The contest
was the first on record between the
two universities in polo, and was
the first of a two-game series.
The Indians were superior to their
rivals in every department of the
game, particularly in mallet work
and in teamwork. The Trojan play
was ragged in both fields, showing
a lack of expert coaching.
Clausen followed Boothe with four
goals, Decker had two, and Howe
one, to complete the Stanford score.
The dusty field slowed up the game
decidedly, apparently affecting the
Trojan play for the most part.
Although the Trojans had recently
trounced U.C.L.A., they were handed
as bad a beating as was the latter
team by the Cards last quarter.
They are apparently not yet up to
conference competition in polo.
The second and final game of the
series will be played on Encina
field, Saturday, at 3:30 o'clock. The
changes in lineups will be by the
Stanford team, Lewis replacing
Clausen at No. 2, and Carter re
placing Decker at No. 1.
