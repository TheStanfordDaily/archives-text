# INDIAN NINE FULFILLS EXPECTATIONS OF EARLY SEASON WITH BEAR SERIES WIN
## 
### 
Giving every indication at the be
ginning of the season of being a hard
team to defeat, Stanford's baseball
varsity has come up to all expecta
tions by winning the California
series, and at the time of writing is
looked upon as the favorite to win
the conference title.
The efforts of Dan Johnson, Harry
Wolter's star sophomore pitcher,
have been the most deciding single
factor in the Indians' successful rec
ord this season: Johnson has won 7,
and lost 1, in conference games this
year, and has been improving stead
ily as the season progressed.
Infield Good
Coupled to the sterling work of
the sophomore pitcher has been the
general all around excellence of the
Indian infield. All the four men in"
the Card infield. Hardy, Philippi,
Delmas, and Dykes Johnson, have
not only improved their individual
style of play but have also smoothed
out the team play.
Given any defensive strength a
team who can out-hit its opponent
will probably win ball games. Led
by Bert Delmas, with an average of
.407 to and including the second
California game, the ten members of
the Stanford squad who have been
assaulting the horsehide, have the

\ following averages:
Out-hit Rivals
j Rudy Rintala .400, Vince Philippi
i .386, Dykes Johnson .338, Gordy
I Campbell .307, Spud Hardy .286,
I Johnny Hunken .264, Dan Johnson
i .200, Art Miller .167, Ike Livermore
; .143. The combined average of these
men is .310.
Even in defeat Stanford always
out-hit the opposition, and it may be
assumed that with the addition of
effective second-string pitchers the
Indians might have had an unblem
j ished record. Loomis has been the
| only second-string pitcher who has
i been able consistently to get the ball
i over the plate. Giving promise in the
I early part of the season, Eddie and
â–  Milsap have failed to develop.
