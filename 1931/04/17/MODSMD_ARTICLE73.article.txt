### 
Stanford's beloved first president
will not be able to extend his per
sonal greetings to the throngs of
alumni who return to the campus
tomorrow for their annual Home
coming Day.
A pilgrimage to the home of David
Starr Jordan, now chancellor emeri
tus, has been cancelled. It had been
planned as a feature of the day's
program scheduled by committees
under the direction of John E. Mc-
Dowell, alumni secretary.
Mrs. Jordan declared yesterday
that the strain of receiving the trib
ute from the hundreds of graduates
who knew Dr. Jordan during their
years on the Farm would be too
severe a tax on his strength. The
chancellor emeritus has been con
fined to his bed for the last week,
although his condition was slightly
improved yesterday.
