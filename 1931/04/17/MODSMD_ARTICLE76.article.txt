# BUS HUES CHANGE LIKE CHAMELEONS
## 
### 
Fear of "blind" night drivers, not
a concession to spring or lovers of
! brilliant hues explains the startling
I color transformation of the busses
j operating between the University
and Palo Alto, and around Palo Alto,
from a rull red to a lively combina
tion of silver and scarlet, a trusted
j employee of the Peninsula R.R.
| Company, who runs the busses, re
; vealed yesterday.
Seven of the company's busses
will be arrayed in the new spring
i colors, it was stated; they will then
be more visible to night drivers. Of
ficials of the company have long felt
| a change of colors would reduce
accidents.
