# ROBLE GYMNASIUM IS ONE OF FINEST CAMPUS BUILDINGS
## Women's Committee Has Now Raised $3,800 For Furnishings 
### 
With the dedication of the new j
Roble Gymnasium this afternoon, !
the Stanford women will formally j
take possession of one of the finest
buildings on the campus, after a pc- j
riod of 30 years in the "temporary" ;
wooden buildings which were nick- j
named "Woodpecker Hall."
The building, which is built to I
harmonize with the rest of the Stan
ford architecture, is the gift of the
Board of Athletic Control and has
been erected at a cost of $250,000.
Its architects were Bakewell and
Brown of San Francisco.
Building's Features
The thoroughly modern building
is cbnstructed around a patio in i
which have been placed a fountain
and shrubs. Offices for the gymna
sium faculty are in the front of the
building, and one wing is devoted to
the medical stafE. Special rooms have
been provided for physio-therapy
and minor surgery equipment.
A large gymnasium room for in
door sports occupies the eastern por
tion of the building, and in the west
ern side is a dance studio of the
same proportions, which will be
used for dancing classes and various
social activities. A social lounge,
equipped with a fire place, and a
small kitchen are features of the
new building.
A new swimming pool, placed out
doors between the gymnasium and
the hockey fields, is graded from
shallow to deep water. The archi
tects have left space for two future
pools for diving and elementary
swimming respectively.
Women Raise Funds
The appropriation made by the
Board of Athletic Control was bare
ly enough for the structure, so the
women have been given the task of
raising at least $20,000 for furnish
ings and equipment. The Women's
Gymnasium Committee has so far
brought the total fund to about $3,-
800 by means of an all-University
carnival in December, various drives
and the contributions of friends and
alumnae.
Further funds will be raised to
morrow with the Kaffee Klatsch
from 9 to 12 o'clock in the gymna
sium, and the sale of concessions
during the Big Meet and the base
ball game in the afternoon. The aux
iliary to the gym committee, which
is composed of interested older wom
en, has been of great assistance in
preparations for tomorrow's activi
ties.

raising at least $20,000 for furnish
ings and equipment. The Women's
Gymnasium Committee has so far
brought the total fund to about $3,-
800 by means of an all-University
carnival in December, various drives
and the contributions of friends and
alumnae.
Further funds will be raised to
morrow with the Kaffee Klatsch
from 9 to 12 o'clock in the gymna
sium, and the sale of concessions
during the Big Meet and the base
ball game in the afternoon. The aux
iliary to the gym committee, which
is composed of interested older wom
en, has been of great assistance in
preparations for tomorrow's activi
ties.
With the dedication of the new j
Roble Gymnasium this afternoon, !
the Stanford women will formally j
take possession of one of the finest
buildings on the campus, after a pc- j
riod of 30 years in the "temporary" ;
wooden buildings which were nick- j
named "Woodpecker Hall."
The building, which is built to I
harmonize with the rest of the Stan
ford architecture, is the gift of the
Board of Athletic Control and has
been erected at a cost of $250,000.
Its architects were Bakewell and
Brown of San Francisco.
Building's Features
The thoroughly modern building
is cbnstructed around a patio in i
which have been placed a fountain
and shrubs. Offices for the gymna
sium faculty are in the front of the
building, and one wing is devoted to
the medical stafE. Special rooms have
been provided for physio-therapy
and minor surgery equipment.
A large gymnasium room for in
door sports occupies the eastern por
tion of the building, and in the west
ern side is a dance studio of the
same proportions, which will be
used for dancing classes and various
social activities. A social lounge,
equipped with a fire place, and a
small kitchen are features of the
new building.
A new swimming pool, placed out
doors between the gymnasium and
the hockey fields, is graded from
shallow to deep water. The archi
tects have left space for two future
pools for diving and elementary
swimming respectively.
Women Raise Funds
The appropriation made by the
Board of Athletic Control was bare
ly enough for the structure, so the
women have been given the task of
raising at least $20,000 for furnish
ings and equipment. The Women's
Gymnasium Committee has so far
brought the total fund to about $3,-
800 by means of an all-University
carnival in December, various drives
and the contributions of friends and
alumnae.
Further funds will be raised to
morrow with the Kaffee Klatsch
from 9 to 12 o'clock in the gymna
sium, and the sale of concessions
during the Big Meet and the base
ball game in the afternoon. The aux
iliary to the gym committee, which
is composed of interested older wom
en, has been of great assistance in
preparations for tomorrow's activi
ties.
