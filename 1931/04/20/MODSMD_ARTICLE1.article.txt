# CARDS' TRIPLE TRIUMPH FIRST IN 38 SEASONS
## Dan Johnson, Aided By Fine Support, Outpitches Horner Again CARDS ALSO BEAT UCLA Victories Virtually Clinch Conference Title 
### Francis Lloyd 
In the sixth inning 38 years of
history were rewritten!
The score had been tied at two
all since the third inning; Stanford
got two men on base in the sixth
and there were two out and two
strikes called on Spud Hardy when
he crashed a Horner offering into
center field, scoring two and giving
the Indians a lead which culminated
in a 6-3 victory in the last game of
the California series.
In order to win the third straight
game from the Bears for the first
time since 1893, the Cards played
the best brand of baseball they have
shown all year. Not one of the nine
men failed to contribute the punch
when it was most needed.
Campbell Scintillates
Naturally Dan Johnson by his ex

of the infield must be counted in
as important factors.
Norm Horner finished his college
pitching career under a cloud of 15
hits from the Stanford bats. Cali
fornia was playing its best game
Saturday and can be credited with
the best individual play of the game
when Kirwan gathered in a tremen
dous drive of Philippi over his
shoulder while running all-out.
Riedc Stops Opposition
With the bases loaded, no outs,
and three runs akeady scoerd in the
fourth inning of the Sianford-
U.C.L.A. ball game on Friday, Hal
Riede took over the pitching duties
for the Cards and proceeded to re
lire the next three men and thereby
keep the Redshirts in the lead which
had been fast disappearing.

Just two things were worth re
membering about Friday's bur
lesque-like engagement—the pitch
ing of Hal Riede in His first varsity
game and the ability of the Indians
to keep on hitting no matter how
many runs were being given gratis
to the opposition.
Bruins Lose Five
Finishing off their Northern trip
with the fifth straight loss, the
Bruins were the picture of despair
md showed it by a general exhibi
ion of sloppy playing. The Indians
seemed to be affected by the laxness
>f their opponents and committed
nore errors than in any other game
his season.
Two games remain to be played
X'fore Harry Wolter can hang the
