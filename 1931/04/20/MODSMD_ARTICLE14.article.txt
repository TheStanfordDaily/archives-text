WASHINGTON, April 19. (/P). —
Three of the Navy's swiftest cruisers
were speeding tonight to protect
American citizens on the north coast
of Honduras, where revolution has
broken out against the liberal re
gime of President Mejia Colindres.
The State and Navy departments,
anxiously engaged for the past week
with the situation in eastern Nica
ragua, found that vexing problem
superseded.
Tela Threatened
A force of 800 insurgents under
: General Ramon Diaz, having cap
i tured Progreso, were advancing on
j Tela, where civil guards had been
| mobilized to maintain order. The
I Memphis had orders to establish
j telephone contact with Tela.
! The American cruiser comman
! ders' orders conformed to the pro
j tective policy enunciated last week
j by Secretary Stimson to apply to
| Nicaragua. They were to limit their
j operations to assuring the safety of
American lives and property in the
coast towns to which they were dis
patched. They were ordered not to
j send forces inland.
Three Ships Sent
In addition to dispatching the
I Memphis to Honduras the Navy late
I today ordered two cruisers and the
j aircraft carrier Langley to proceed
j immediately from Guantanamo,
Cuba, to Honduran and Nicaraguan
ports.
The immediate revolutionary
thi-eat appeared to be directed at
Tela, 55 miles west of Ceiba, where
a steamer of the United Fruit Com
pany was held in port to evacuate
Americans if necessary.
