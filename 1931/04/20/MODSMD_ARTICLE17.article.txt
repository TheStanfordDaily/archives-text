# Dignity In Spanish Revolt Praised By Dr. Espinosa
## 
### JEANETTE GOULD 
That the victory of the Republi
cans in Spain was not as great as
j reports lead one to believe is the
! opinion of Dr. Aurelio M. Espinosa,
j Professor of Romanic Languages, as
j stated in an interview last night.
There are 50 provinces in Spain.
! In the recent election, 40 of the
| provinces voted Republican, and 10
; had majorities in favor of the king,
i Dr. Espinosa said. He received this
j information yesterday from friends
J in New York.
Presented to King
j Dr. Espinosa was presented to the
i King of Spain by the president of
| the Spanish Academy in 1920. A year
! later he, with five other students
' picked from Spanish universities,
was made a Knight Commander of
1 the Royal Order of Isabella the
Catholic. Professor Hills of the Uni
versity of California was among
these students.
The establishment of a republic in
Spain was expected, according to the
professor, but not as suddenly as it
happened. One of Dr. Espinosa s

I sons is studying in Spain, and in his
I latest letter to his father, he said
■ that the Republicans would prob
i ably not come into power for five or
! six months.
Dr. Espinosa remarked upon the
dignity and lack of bloodshed with
which the revolution was carried
on. ''No one knows what will hap
-1 pen in the future," he said. He added
| that a betterment of popular educa-
I tion would probably take place, but
! other than that he did not think the
i new government would make de-
I cisive steps forward. This was at-
I tributed to the conservativeness of
j the Republican leaders.
King Still Popular
Although Alphonso XIII has ab
dicated, he is still popular with his
people, according to the professor,
j adding that the Queen and the royal
family felt the revolt more than did
i the King. "He is a stoic," Dr. Es
pinosa said in explanation.
"I am satisfied, but not happy,"
said Dr. Espinosa. "The revolution
was expected, but I am sorry to see
| such a fine man as Alphonso go."

Although Alphonso XIII has ab
