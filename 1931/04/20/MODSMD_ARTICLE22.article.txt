# Russian Satire Scores Hit In Annual Opera
## Logan, Thompson Praised In Comedy Roles 
### Staff Reviewer 
Clever lines and an understand- j
able plot combined with the fine I
acting of the two comedians, Harry j
Lee Logan and Joe Thompson, made >
"Proletariat Plus" one of the fun- j
niest junior operas produced here in ;
recent years and brought to a sue- :
cessful close the Dramatic Council's j
1931 season.
The audience liked the opera and 1
entered enthusiastically into the I
spirit of the plot, hissing the villain J
and applauding the hero. It was a 1
traditional plot, with the hero win- i
ning the girl and the villain getting
his just deserts, but s'till it was a j
better planned and more cohesive j
one than is generally found in jun- !
ior operas.
Opera Well Written
Don Cameron-and Paul Lorton, |
co-authors of the comedy, did a j
good job, effectively writing in the
songs and dances so that their intro
duction did not interrupt the fast
action of the play.
Specialty acts were well chosen j
by Harold Helvenston, who is to be
congratulated on the beautiful ta
bleau staged in the second act with
Stephen Farrand assisted by Mar
ian Jones and Mary Lou Leistner. j
Both the tap dancers, Terry Brickley .
and Fred Pearman, and tjpe "red
heads," Jean Hay and Harrison Foss,
were generously encored.
With a comparatively small comic j
part, Harry Lee Logan introduced
some impromptu lines and acting (
which enlivened every scene he '
played. Helen Sue Eyster as Alice ,
Cole had personality and with her
pleasing voice made a charming he
roine. It was unfortunate that John
Skinner's tenor voice did not blend
better with hers in their duets.
Musante, Matesky Star
Catherine Musante as Velma and
Leo Matesky as Garski were the ;
most Russian of the Russians. The i
melodramatic comic touch came to j
the foreground in all the sneaking I
machinations of the two rival gangs.
Bosanski, played by Milton Hand. ,
added a few "blood and thunder" !
touches of his own, which were re- 1
ceived with uproarious applause i
from the audience.
"Another Day" was a lovely lyric, !
while "Introducing Me" and "Stick j
Your Bugle in the Brew," the comic j
song hit of the opera, rivaled the
theme song for first honors. Inci
dentally, this reviewer was quite at
a loss to decide whether the trio of
violins was meant to be comic or
serious.
Costumes were colorful and de
lightfully picturesque, especially the ,
chorus costumes. Directing honors
again go to Helvenston for his work
on this show.
