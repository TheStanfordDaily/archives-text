# Card Track Men Swamp California With 101 Points
## "Big Meet" Performances Show That Templeton Has Developed Another Great Track Team; Ben Eastman Breaks Tape in 3 Races BOB JONES TOSSES DISCUS OUT FOR 157 FEET DeGroot Vaults 13 Feet 6 Inches, Lombard! Beats Hables In Both Sprints For First Time 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
TEN THOUSAND fans saw red in the Stadium Saturday as Dink Temple
ton's band of Indians buried California under a record Big Meet score
of 101 2-3 to 29 l-:5 to prove beyond doubt that 19:51 finds Stanford with
another "great" track and field team. Sports circles still buzz over the
events of a day which saw three meet records demolished, three others
i equalled, a new intercollegiate mark set, and six Cardinal clean sweeps.
But today the watchword becomes "Down with Troy," and Bie Meet

results will soon fade into the his-
I tory books, mentioned only in gossip
and doping which centers around
May 2.
Smith Sets Record
j Though brilliant individual per-
I formances on the part of the lled-
I shirts were lacking except in Cap
j tain Podge Smith's 23.5 low hurdles
, time, the performance of the team
I as a whole revealed a balanced pow
jer which spells "beware" to the
Trojans.
i Let Mr. Cromwell worry over
I these developments: three men
; throwing the discus more than 151
i feet, three more running close to
! 15.2 in the high hurdles, a trio of
: potential record-breaking sprinters
; instead of two, three quarter-milers
i under 49 flat, a high jumper better
' than 6 feet 1 inch, and a pole vaulter
! at 13 feet 6 inches.
Discus Power
While Bob Jones was proving bc
-1 yond doubt that he is a consistent
j 155 feet discus tosser, two other gen
tlemen, Here Laborde and Norm
1 McLeod, came through to crack 151
for the first time in their platter
throwing careers.
Nisbet, the eternal barrier-stum -
! bier, demonstrated that he is to be
| reckoned with in any man's race by
' skimming over them all to win the
' highs for the first time in a blue
(moon from Captain Smith, while
! Brugman followed close on the heels
of this pair.
Lombardi Surprises
Dink has always been confident
that Hector Dyer and Leslie Hables
can take care of themselves, but
Saturday Frank Lombardi came into
his own to break up this combina
tion with two beautiful performances
in the sprints. Frank WykofT now
, has three stars to beat on May 2
, instead of two.

Fans wondered why Ben Eastman
wasn't than a few scant yards
i ahead of his teammates, Maynor
Shove and Ike Hables, as he broke
the 440 tape Saturday. The time of
| 48.3 answered the question, proving
i taht Stanford's Boy Wonder was not
( loafing, nor were Shove and Hables.
If these two continue to improve, 48
seconds will have a couple of more
threateners.
Two' New Stars
Bobby Jones is answering two of
Dink Templeton's early season pray-
| ers, adding a 6-foot 1-inch high
I jump to his record discus heave of
! 157 feet s:ii5 :i i inches. And that Stan
i ford now has a 13 and a half foot
' pole vaulter was brought to light by
• Burt DeGroot Saturday when he
| cleared that height to beat out the
: Blue and Gold favorite, George Pool.

Smith Sets Record
j Though brilliant individual per-
I formances on the part of the lled-
I shirts were lacking except in Cap
j tain Podge Smith's 23.5 low hurdles
, time, the performance of the team
I as a whole revealed a balanced pow
jer which spells "beware" to the
Trojans.
i Let Mr. Cromwell worry over
I these developments: three men
; throwing the discus more than 151
i feet, three more running close to
! 15.2 in the high hurdles, a trio of
: potential record-breaking sprinters
; instead of two, three quarter-milers
i under 49 flat, a high jumper better
' than 6 feet 1 inch, and a pole vaulter
! at 13 feet 6 inches.
Discus Power
While Bob Jones was proving bc
-1 yond doubt that he is a consistent
j 155 feet discus tosser, two other gen
tlemen, Here Laborde and Norm
1 McLeod, came through to crack 151
for the first time in their platter

Nisbet, the eternal barrier-stum -

Dink has always been confident

Saturday Frank Lombardi came into
his own to break up this combina

, has three stars to beat on May 2
, instead of two.

Fans wondered why Ben Eastman
wasn't than a few scant yards
i ahead of his teammates, Maynor
Shove and Ike Hables, as he broke
the 440 tape Saturday. The time of
| 48.3 answered the question, proving
i taht Stanford's Boy Wonder was not
( loafing, nor were Shove and Hables.
If these two continue to improve, 48
seconds will have a couple of more

Bobby Jones is answering two of
Dink Templeton's early season pray-

I jump to his record discus heave of
