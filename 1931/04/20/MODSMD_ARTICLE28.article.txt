# A 						LIBERAL MOVE

### 
For some vcurs, the United States lias maintained
armed forces in supposedly sovereign foreign countries, for
(lie ostensible purpose of protecting American properly in
those countries. Last week the l'nited Slates officially set
forth a new policy of action in the Caribbean, in the neigh
borhood where American armed forces have been particu
larly active. The United States will no longer send naval
or marine forces into Nicaragua or other disturbed Latin
American countries for the protection of the property of
American citizens or corporations.
This is a liberal move, toward putting a stop to what has
been in effect government subsidy of American exploita
tion of Latin America. That tins subsidy has not been
merely defense of American property but active aggression
against the rights and property of native citizens of Carib
bean countries there is ample proof. But the dollar has
loomed large in the eves of American foreign traders, quite
obscuring human rights; the present value of American
property and investments in Nicaragua is about .$19,500,00(1.
Opposed to the appalling injustices of the United States'
armed intervention in and occupation of Latin American
countries in the past is the honest and liberal attitude ot
Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. Borah succinctly stated his position Saturday,
when he said:
"It is one thing to protect American lives when threat
ened. It is a wholly different thing to take possession of a
country and interfere with the local government and un
dertake to furnish general police force for all those who
have invested." When American citizens go into an unde
veloped country thev consent to the kind of government
that country has, and "it should not be the business of the
United States to substitute our rule for the rule of the
people whose country it is, in order to accommodate in
vestors."'
It is indeed to be hoped that our government will con
tinue this new and progressive policy; it will aid in allaying
the just indignation and anger which many Latin Ameri
cans feel because of the activities of armed forces of the
United States in their countries.
