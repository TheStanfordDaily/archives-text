# AGAIN-WHITHER EDUCATION?
## 
### 
Two announcements significant in tlie field of education
wore made las! week. From \Y. \Y. Comfort, president of
Haverford -College, Pennsylvania, came the declaration
that "quality rather than quantity education" was the na
tion's need, and that Haverford's new program would be
designed to "show what could be done with .'{()() selected
young men when placed in the company of cultured and
sympathetic teachers."
In direct contrast to President Comfort's statement
comes the announcement of Dr. Thornewell Jacobs, presi
dent of Oglethorpe University, Georgia, that that institu
tion will inaugurate a "radio university," in which lectures
and examinations will be broadcast to the students. Under
this plan, professor and student will confer only once a
month, but full college credit will be given for each subject
passed, and degrets awarded at the completion of a four
year course.
If these two ventures are to be considered as represent
ing the trend of education, what is one to conclude as to
that trend? The Haverford plan is avowedly selective; the
Oglethorpe plan is obviously designed for the mass. What
is the answer?
In the past two decades, the attendance at institutions
of higher learning has increased greatly. There have been
those who have cried out against this mass education; the*
question of "Who shall go to college?" has been a much
discussed one. The Haverford plan may be the beginning
of a reaction against our present system; the Oglethorpe
scheme may show the way to its further development. At
any event, within the next quarter century the nation will
probably have discovered whether it wants all its sons to
go to college, or only a chosen few.
