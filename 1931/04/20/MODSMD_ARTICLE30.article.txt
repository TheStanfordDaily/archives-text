That forbidding total of $20,000, needed for furnishing
file women's gymnasium, may he raised vet. Aetivilies of
the women on l T niversily Day added .$2,000 lo Hie $3,800
I hey had previously secured.
l! took Ihe organized efforts of 300 women to raise that
$2,000 Saturday. In I lie morning they served over six hun
dred alumni and students at the Kaffee Klalsch, held in the
Spanish patio of the new gym and superintended by
women students and alumnae. Later in the day these
women operated Ihe concessions at the track meet and
hasehall game.
In less than ;i year Stanford women have raised $5,800
for their gymnasium. I( seems likely that hy this time next
year Ihe entire $20,(KM) required to furnish it will have heen
obtained.
