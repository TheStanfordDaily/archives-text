# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
The long gruelling race is over.
And when the winning runner
breaks the tape upon his heaving
chest, friends from the sidelines
rush to him with glee. They murmur
words of praise into his burning
ears. He is supported; his legs arc
rubbed to lessen the stiffness of the
long test; he is helped into his sweat
togs—and for a few minutes after
the race, the world is his.
About 30 or 40 seconds after the
winner falls into the' arms of the
awaiting crowd, a forlorn and dismal
figure makes his winding way down
the home stretch. He is panting hard
and it is with evident strain that he
moves his heavy feet up and down.
His head is rolling on his shoulders'
and his tongue is all but hanging
out. He is the last place man. Few
even see him finish if something else
is going on. He totters past the finish
line and no one rushes to aid him.
It sometimes appears that if he
should drop over dead on the track,
he would remain unnoticed until
the runners in the next event stum
bled over him.
It is probably in this, as well as
anything else, that the tenor of mod
ern college athletics is revealed. The
stress is not on developing men but
on developing winners. The cham
pion is placed on a small throne and
worshipped but the men who rarely,

tif ever, even place, are ignored. It
| is this stress which is responsible
for the whole setup of modern in
tercollegiate athletics. One would
1 never even hear talk of subsidizing
1 athletes if the stress were not on
winning—and winning at any cost.
I But perhaps this is natural. In
; business, in bridge, or any other
post-college pursuit, the emphasis is
; on winning, on being a success. We
| rarely hear of the $20 per week rib
bon clerks. They are the last place
j men in the business world. Everyone
j asks the bridge champ how he
! makes those "finesses" work. No
i one bothers himself much, in a posi-
I tive way, over the bloke who trumps
' aces, fails to follow suit, and talks
i about literature or politics while the
I game is in process.
It is sometimes felt that while all
! this may be true in the outside
j world, but things should be different
at an institution of higher learning,
j This is impossible. The people who
! come to college are products of Ihe
i outside world and judge college ac
j tivities by the world's standards. We
in college are not secluded, and
i apart from the world; we are in it.
The business world has its Morgans
| and Rockefellers, and Fords; we
I have men who can WIN 101 2-3
points. Honor to all!
