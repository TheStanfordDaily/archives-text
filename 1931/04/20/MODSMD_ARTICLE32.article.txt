AN EPIC OF INSOLENCI

The Editor, Sir:
May an exploited and aggrieved
I member of the student body express
i his crawling disgust at an unspeak
i able atrocity committed on All-'CJni
i versity Day?
The ensuing remarks—trusting in
! your sympathetic co-operation to
save thousands misery—are anent
| the showing, Saturday night last, at
the Stanford Theatre, of what was
wantonly, maliciously, and decep-
I tively termed a "motion picture." I
might add that the only "motion"
to the wretched affair v/as the help
less squirming of the audience who
I had been tricked into attending the
1 ghastly thing under the pretense of
i its being a moving picture.
In all candour —and as much im
. partiality as is human—l assert vig
orously that "Fair Warning" is the
| most heinous and villainous act of
torture ever to be perpetrated in
cinema. If any of the innocently
crowded house enjoyed the show, it
1 was certainly due to a moronic
i sense of value, the like of which
even a college audience is quite in
! capable.
To think of such an atrocily being
practiced by Fox Brothers upon an
I innocent audience whose only sin

' had been to pay good silver money
for its betrayal is a strain upon
credulity. And the more shame
i theirs for "co-operating" with All-
University Day to the extent of
J taking an inglorious advantage of
ian augmented Saturday night
crowd!
Truly, it was pitiful—grown men
| and women, harmless professors and
well-meaning students —all were led
to the slaughter as innocently as
unsheared lambs! Betrayer, sheared,
tortured! All in a most inglorious
! and utterly calloused manner.
It is difficult to stop pouring an
abusive stream of criticism upon the
fiendishness of the perverted and
I malicious mind whose unholy and
abased "creation" this production
was, but I pause in my excoriation
to mention an even more flagvant
aspect of this sordid affair. To my
mind, the showing of "Fair Warn
ing" was an insult to the mentality
of Stanford students that could not
be equalled by the wildest thoughts
of a deranged mind—it was an epic
Icf insolence. Even a Long Beach
j audience would have resented it.
Yours most sincerely,
