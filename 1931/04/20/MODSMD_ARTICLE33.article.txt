Official home-coming has been
thoroughly attended to, once again,
and maybe now we can settle down
to just an ordinary week of spring
fever, uninterrupted by gypsies sell
ing peanuts without monkeys at
tached, or inquiries for the location
of Hoover's home (Dare we hope
that, even for one day?).
It's another '"poor Cal!" to l»c
sure, after the week-end just
past. Maybe people here feel
that they should get something
besides grades out of their quar
terly f>9. At least, with enough
ambition you may even have a
chance at a job in a cannery
when you graduate, instead of
the usual street-sweeping.
Witness the iron men in the meet
Saturday, who would not content
themselves with competing' in any
less than three events. Unofficial
reports from Keppige's own head
quarters (being an illogical brain),
have it that short races like the 220
will soon be discarded as competi-

ion events, and will be used only
or limbering up for the 35-mile,
?tc.

And with all that, an enthusi
astic alum had the audacity to
suggest tlint "it certainly is too
had we can't run up scores like
that in football, any more." And
more is right. Ye gods! Who
wants to bother with 11 huskies
when there are people like Iron j
Man Eastman around, who don't
even need signals?
A hand in passing, folks, to the |
S.C. polo team. Not that we're turn- 1
ing traitor to our ancient feud \
against the institution. But this is I
the first year they've tried the game, (
and the boys are going through a j
pretty successful season without a I
coach 01* any other sort of backing. }
Their own horses, uniforms, and en- I
thusiasm. That's sporting.

Dunno just what it is our little
god Johnson puts behind the ball,
but it sure, sure works. The first Cal j
i series in—how many years? Too 1
bad, with the new diamond and j
everything, that they couldn't have
built enough seats to go around,
while they were about it. Maybe
that's to come later. How about a
little tinfoil sale, to help the cause i
i along?

And with all that, an enthusi
astic alum had the audacity to
suggest tlint "it certainly is too
had we can't run up scores like
that in football, any more." And
more is right. Ye gods! Who
wants to bother with 11 huskies
when there are people like Iron j
Man Eastman around, who don't
even need signals?
A hand in passing, folks, to the |
S.C. polo team. Not that we're turn- 1

against the institution. But this is I
the first year they've tried the game, (
and the boys are going through a j
pretty successful season without a I
coach 01* any other sort of backing. }
Their own horses, uniforms, and en- I
thusiasm. That's sporting.

Dunno just what it is our little
god Johnson puts behind the ball,
but it sure, sure works. The first Cal j
i series in—how many years? Too 1
bad, with the new diamond and j
everything, that they couldn't have
built enough seats to go around,
while they were about it. Maybe
that's to come later. How about a
little tinfoil sale, to help the cause i
i along?
Official home-coming has been
thoroughly attended to, once again,
and maybe now we can settle down
to just an ordinary week of spring
fever, uninterrupted by gypsies sell
ing peanuts without monkeys at
tached, or inquiries for the location
of Hoover's home (Dare we hope
that, even for one day?).
It's another '"poor Cal!" to l»c
sure, after the week-end just
past. Maybe people here feel
that they should get something
besides grades out of their quar
terly f>9. At least, with enough
ambition you may even have a
chance at a job in a cannery
when you graduate, instead of
the usual street-sweeping.
Witness the iron men in the meet
Saturday, who would not content
themselves with competing' in any
less than three events. Unofficial
reports from Keppige's own head
quarters (being an illogical brain),
have it that short races like the 220
will soon be discarded as competi-

ion events, and will be used only
or limbering up for the 35-mile,
