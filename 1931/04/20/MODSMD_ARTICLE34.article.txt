MAN OF THE WORLD—At lhe-
Stanford Theatre.
William Powell leaves the crime
field, in this picture, for one of hard
ly less high-voltage suspense po
tentialities — the newspaper field.
Hounded by an unsavory reputation
in the United States, Powell shifts
his ground, and plays a precariously
bold game on the Continent. Sheer
: audacity and cleverness carry him
through, until he meets a girl "who
• is different."
The plot moves adroitly and swift -
i ly to a conclusion which surprises,
! yet seems adequate. Powell's suav
| ity, impeccable grooming, aloof, pol
j ished nonchalance, etc., is as ad-
I mirable as ever. One doesn't tire of
[ real art, real technique, somehow.
The new leading lady is ravishing.

GENTLEMAN'S FATE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Metro's latest effort to save John
(Gilbert for posterity is more suc
cessful than the sea epic that last
affronted us hut hardly of certain

i
Gangsterism takes another death
blow as Gilbert, after cleverly strug
gling through to the last few feet
1 of film only to be shot by a rival
| gang chief, gasps a moral mouthful
! and passes out to the accompani

ment of unseen violins.
Comedy injected is ghastly but a
nice wet rainstorm has been sup
plied. And thanks to Will Hays our
children are saved from profane
j contacts when Florio says "What
| the . . . ." and forthwith closes his
j mouth to look nasty. —J.S.S.
