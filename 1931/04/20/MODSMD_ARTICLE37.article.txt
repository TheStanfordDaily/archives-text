# STUDENTS SEEK TO END ARMY TRAINING
## 
### 
One thousand students at the Uni
i versity of Washington have signed a
; petition to abolish compulsory mili
j tary training at the university. The
i petition is being circulated by the
j Liberal Club.
Agitation is being increased by
! decisions to hold student discussions
I on the subject of compulsory train
i ing, and a faculty debate will be
centered on the question.
To counteract this action, over
thirty posts of the American Legion
fiave passed resolutions against the
I abolition of compulsory military
â–  training.
