# MEMBER OF OLD GUARD REVIEWS RUIN WROUGHT BY DISASTROUS TREMOR OF '06

"Everything flat."
This was the first impression of
the appearance of the University fol
lowing the San Francisco earthquake
of 1906, which literally restored the
campus to the Stone Age just 25
years ago Saturday. All the taller
buildings which had served as land
marks—the Memorial Church, the
great stone arch, the power house
chimney, the new library and gym
nasium—were down. Dr. W. A.
Cooper, professor of German, yes
terday reviewed the historic disaster.
No sooner had the people re
covered from their fright than two
cheering reports were circulated.
One, that there would be a similar
earthquake shortly; and the other
that all the lunatics from Agnews,
only a few miles away, were at
large.
After spending the day running
in and out of buildings at each
minor shock, the students finally
settled down at night in beds placed,
supposedly safely, out of doors, en
tertained one moment by the
thought of a second quake and the
next by the idea of prowling luna
tics. The San Francisco fh'e filled
the air with a pail of smoke, and
at night tongues of flames could be
seen shooting up in the air.

\ A wild scramble to lay in as great
a supply-of non-perishable food as
I one's pocket money would allow
' followed the immediate closing of
all banks. In order to pay the pro
fessors Mr. Lathrop telegraphed to
Chicago for a "few barrels" of paper
' money which, was a great novelty to
the business men accustomed to hard
cash, gold, silver, .and nickel.
Railroads immediately announced
that they would take refugees out
, of the city and ship them free as far
1 away, as they cared to go. One story
was told of a Swede who came run-
I ning to the pier but arrived just as
i the ferry was about 20 feet out.
His Swedish friend on board called
|to him, "Yoomp, Ole, I tank you
I make it in two yoomps."'
