California's Blue and Gold Bear
limped home to his Berkeley lair
Saturday afternoon, dragging his
tail between his legs after talcing an
awful trouncing here on the Farm
in three major sports: tennis, track,
tnd baseball. The medicine adminis
tered by the Farm hands was se
vere; a 9-0 sweep victory in tennis,
i 1(11 2-3 to 29 1-3 new Big Red Meet
record, and a clean-cut fi-3 triumph
to make it three straight on the ball
iiamond.

Rubbing it into the poor ani
mal is fun for awhile, but grows
tiresome, as the monotony of U.C.
drubbings increases. Plenty of
"words have been written about
this sad state of affairs across
the bay. Let's concentrate on the
Trojans, whose track team is
scheduled to invade these parts
on May 2 to participate in what
threatens to be the best dual
meet since Achilles was in his
heyday.
A lot of sleepy-eyed fans sat at
he breakfast table yesterday morn
ng rubbing their orbs and blinking
inbelievingly at the results of the.
Trojan-L.A.A.C. encounter in the
South Saturday. Thursday morning
his column predicted that Troy
vould beat the Mercuries at about
0 to 61. That part of it was 0.K.,
iince S.C. won by 66'L 1 to 64'j, but
.ome of the winning times, heights,
ind distances looked like typo
graphical errors.
Here are few of them; read
'em and weep: 9.6 in the cen
tury. 4:t9.4 in the mile, a 15.2
quarter-mile, 9:42 in the two
mile. 23.4 for the low hurdles, a
3:15.8 mile relay, 210 feet in the
javelin throw, 24 feet 37,s inches
for the broad jump, and a pole
vault of 13 feet 6 incites. And all
of those marks were recorded by
Red and Gold athletes, except
ing the javelin toss.
Let's admit that all of that is very
?ad, and then proceed to see what
vould have happened Saturday if
Trojan and Indian athletes had met
md performed just as they did in
heir respective track meets. Of
:ourse there must be some guess
vork concerning second and third
places, but as close as we can figure
vithout taking into consideration
mything but cold, hard results of
Saturday, Stanford would have won
>y 6o to S5!
Here's the way they stack up:
In the 100 and 220—YVykolT,
Dyer, and Lombardi; quarter
mile—Williams, Eastman, Shove;
half-mile—Eastman, Fitzmau
rice, McGcagh: mile—Halstead,
Brown, Learned; two-mile—Un
ruh. Aebersold, Callahan; high
hurdles—Nisbet, Stokes, Smith;
low hurdles—Payne, Carls; re
lay — U.S.C.; shot put — Gray,
Hall, Laborde; discus—Jones,
Laborde, McLeod: high jump—
Jones, tie for second between
Stewart, McNaughton. and Brat
ton; broad jump—Barber. But
ler, Werdcr; pole vault—tie for
first between DeGroot and Gra
ber, Ch'entzos third; javelin—
Boeger, McKen/ie, Zuger.
Obviously things will be greatly
hanged by May 2. but that is the
a test dope. Added up, it should
■qual 66 to 65, Stanford. Reversals
re due to take place both ways in
everal events, and nobody knows
iow the coaches will shift their
earns around at the last minute.
Jut unless Cromwell uncovers more
han this shows, it looks as though
he Indian score will be the one to
icrer.se. Eastman should beat Vic
Villiams in the quarter, no matter
/hat the Southern star does on May
Then Aebersold has a good
chance of besting Unruh, and
West might be in there doing
things in the broad jumping pits.
It's also hard to admit that any
quartet in the world can outdo
Templeton's stellar relay team,
but 3:15.8 is known as excellent
time! And Ray should be tossing
the spear for Dink's boys with a
first to make it eight instead of
six in the javelin.

California's Blue and Gold Bear
limped home to his Berkeley lair
Saturday afternoon, dragging his
tail between his legs after talcing an
awful trouncing here on the Farm
in three major sports: tennis, track,
tnd baseball. The medicine adminis
tered by the Farm hands was se
vere; a 9-0 sweep victory in tennis,
i 1(11 2-3 to 29 1-3 new Big Red Meet
record, and a clean-cut fi-3 triumph
to make it three straight on the ball
iiamond.

Rubbing it into the poor ani
mal is fun for awhile, but grows
tiresome, as the monotony of U.C.
drubbings increases. Plenty of
"words have been written about
this sad state of affairs across
the bay. Let's concentrate on the
Trojans, whose track team is
scheduled to invade these parts
on May 2 to participate in what
threatens to be the best dual
meet since Achilles was in his
heyday.
A lot of sleepy-eyed fans sat at
he breakfast table yesterday morn
ng rubbing their orbs and blinking
inbelievingly at the results of the.
Trojan-L.A.A.C. encounter in the
South Saturday. Thursday morning
his column predicted that Troy
vould beat the Mercuries at about
0 to 61. That part of it was 0.K.,
iince S.C. won by 66'L 1 to 64'j, but
.ome of the winning times, heights,
ind distances looked like typo
graphical errors.
Here are few of them; read
'em and weep: 9.6 in the cen
tury. 4:t9.4 in the mile, a 15.2
quarter-mile, 9:42 in the two
mile. 23.4 for the low hurdles, a
3:15.8 mile relay, 210 feet in the
javelin throw, 24 feet 37,s inches
for the broad jump, and a pole
vault of 13 feet 6 incites. And all
of those marks were recorded by
Red and Gold athletes, except
ing the javelin toss.
Let's admit that all of that is very
?ad, and then proceed to see what
vould have happened Saturday if
Trojan and Indian athletes had met
md performed just as they did in
heir respective track meets. Of
:ourse there must be some guess
vork concerning second and third
places, but as close as we can figure
vithout taking into consideration
mything but cold, hard results of
Saturday, Stanford would have won
>y 6o to S5!
Here's the way they stack up:
In the 100 and 220—YVykolT,
Dyer, and Lombardi; quarter
mile—Williams, Eastman, Shove;
half-mile—Eastman, Fitzmau
rice, McGcagh: mile—Halstead,
Brown, Learned; two-mile—Un
ruh. Aebersold, Callahan; high
hurdles—Nisbet, Stokes, Smith;
low hurdles—Payne, Carls; re
lay — U.S.C.; shot put — Gray,
Hall, Laborde; discus—Jones,
Laborde, McLeod: high jump—
Jones, tie for second between
Stewart, McNaughton. and Brat
ton; broad jump—Barber. But
ler, Werdcr; pole vault—tie for
first between DeGroot and Gra
ber, Ch'entzos third; javelin—
Boeger, McKen/ie, Zuger.
Obviously things will be greatly
hanged by May 2. but that is the
a test dope. Added up, it should
■qual 66 to 65, Stanford. Reversals
re due to take place both ways in
everal events, and nobody knows
iow the coaches will shift their
earns around at the last minute.
Jut unless Cromwell uncovers more
han this shows, it looks as though
he Indian score will be the one to
icrer.se. Eastman should beat Vic
Villiams in the quarter, no matter
/hat the Southern star does on May
Then Aebersold has a good
chance of besting Unruh, and
West might be in there doing
things in the broad jumping pits.
It's also hard to admit that any
quartet in the world can outdo
Templeton's stellar relay team,
but 3:15.8 is known as excellent
time! And Ray should be tossing
the spear for Dink's boys with a

quartet in the world can outdo
Templeton's stellar relay team,
but 3:15.8 is known as excellent
time! And Ray should be tossing
the spear for Dink's boys with a
first to make it eight instead of
six in the javelin.

California's Blue and Gold Bear
limped home to his Berkeley lair
Saturday afternoon, dragging his
tail between his legs after talcing an
awful trouncing here on the Farm
in three major sports: tennis, track,
tnd baseball. The medicine adminis
tered by the Farm hands was se
vere; a 9-0 sweep victory in tennis,
i 1(11 2-3 to 29 1-3 new Big Red Meet
record, and a clean-cut fi-3 triumph
to make it three straight on the ball
iiamond.

Rubbing it into the poor ani
mal is fun for awhile, but grows
tiresome, as the monotony of U.C.
drubbings increases. Plenty of
"words have been written about
this sad state of affairs across
the bay. Let's concentrate on the
Trojans, whose track team is
scheduled to invade these parts
on May 2 to participate in what
threatens to be the best dual
meet since Achilles was in his
heyday.
A lot of sleepy-eyed fans sat at
he breakfast table yesterday morn
ng rubbing their orbs and blinking
inbelievingly at the results of the.
Trojan-L.A.A.C. encounter in the
South Saturday. Thursday morning
his column predicted that Troy
vould beat the Mercuries at about
0 to 61. That part of it was 0.K.,
iince S.C. won by 66'L 1 to 64'j, but
.ome of the winning times, heights,
ind distances looked like typo
graphical errors.
Here are few of them; read
'em and weep: 9.6 in the cen
tury. 4:t9.4 in the mile, a 15.2
quarter-mile, 9:42 in the two
mile. 23.4 for the low hurdles, a
3:15.8 mile relay, 210 feet in the
javelin throw, 24 feet 37,s inches
for the broad jump, and a pole
vault of 13 feet 6 incites. And all
of those marks were recorded by
Red and Gold athletes, except
ing the javelin toss.
Let's admit that all of that is very
?ad, and then proceed to see what
vould have happened Saturday if
Trojan and Indian athletes had met
md performed just as they did in
heir respective track meets. Of
:ourse there must be some guess
vork concerning second and third
places, but as close as we can figure
vithout taking into consideration
mything but cold, hard results of
Saturday, Stanford would have won
>y 6o to S5!
Here's the way they stack up:
In the 100 and 220—YVykolT,
Dyer, and Lombardi; quarter
mile—Williams, Eastman, Shove;
half-mile—Eastman, Fitzmau
rice, McGcagh: mile—Halstead,
Brown, Learned; two-mile—Un
ruh. Aebersold, Callahan; high
hurdles—Nisbet, Stokes, Smith;
low hurdles—Payne, Carls; re
lay — U.S.C.; shot put — Gray,
Hall, Laborde; discus—Jones,
Laborde, McLeod: high jump—
Jones, tie for second between
Stewart, McNaughton. and Brat
ton; broad jump—Barber. But
ler, Werdcr; pole vault—tie for
first between DeGroot and Gra
ber, Ch'entzos third; javelin—
Boeger, McKen/ie, Zuger.
Obviously things will be greatly
hanged by May 2. but that is the
a test dope. Added up, it should
■qual 66 to 65, Stanford. Reversals
re due to take place both ways in
everal events, and nobody knows
iow the coaches will shift their
earns around at the last minute.
Jut unless Cromwell uncovers more
han this shows, it looks as though
he Indian score will be the one to
icrer.se. Eastman should beat Vic
Villiams in the quarter, no matter
/hat the Southern star does on May
Then Aebersold has a good
chance of besting Unruh, and
West might be in there doing
things in the broad jumping pits.
It's also hard to admit that any
quartet in the world can outdo
Templeton's stellar relay team,
but 3:15.8 is known as excellent
time! And Ray should be tossing
the spear for Dink's boys with a
first to make it eight instead of
six in the javelin.
