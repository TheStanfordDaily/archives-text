Surprising even the most optimis
! tic campus fans, the varsity netmen
Saturday trounced the Golden
Bear by an overwhelming clean
sweep score, 9 to 0, to capture the
Southern Division title of the Pacific
Coast Conference. Losing only one
, set throughout the course of the
J meet, the Indians duplicated their
: feat against the Trojans to establish
I the astonishing record of having lost
but two sets on the local courts all
I season.
Keith Gledhill, despite his sprained
ankle, handled both his singles and
I doubles encounters in highly credit-
I able fashion. His score in the feature
match with Blade was 7-5, 6-4. The
California captain had him on the
short end of a 4-0 count in the first
set only to drop game after game
before the Indian first man's beauti
ful mixed shots. Blade proved more
erratic in the second set and could
not hold the flashy Indian.
Captain Ted Easton lost the only
j set of the meet to Hyde, although
he finally came out on top 6-1, 3-6,
6-4. The score was tied at 4-4 in
