### 
Proceeds of the Kaffee Klatsch in !
the new Roble Gymnasium Saturday j

the Big Meet and the baseball game, !
both under the auspices of the Wo- I
men's Gymnasium Committee, were !
approximately $2,000, but expenses j
incurred have not yet been de- !
ducted from this sum.

Six hundred people were served I
at the Kaffee Klatsch. With dona- !
tions given during the morning, the i
money taken in at the fruit stand, j
and the other sales, including "Pop" |
Warner's sketches, candy, and flow- !
ers, approximately $800 was received )
in the morning activities.

Because of Stadium contracts, ice I
cream and soda water had to be !
purchased and were taken care of :
by Orville Tucker of the Board of j
Athletic Control. He attended to the
purchasing and to the arrangement
of the booths inside and outside of
the Stadium and had all the booths j
in readiness for the women at noon.

A number of donations of food and
candy were unsold at the end of the ;
day. These will be sold this week, j
materially adding to the proceeds
taken in for the benefit of the new
gymnasium. A report of the net
profit will be made at the end of the |
week by the finance committee with j
Mrs. Alice Roedel as chairman.
