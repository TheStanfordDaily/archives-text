# INDIAN POLO TEAM SWAMPS TROJANS 20-0, WINS SERIES
## Second String Players See Action During Game; Lewis, Howe Star 
### 
In a slow game that was marred
by frequent misplays, the Stanford
polo team overwhelmed U.S.C. 20-0
Saturday at Encina Field.
It was simply a case of Stanford
carrying too many guns for the Tro
jans; the Indian team, composed
partly of second-string players, was
able to score practically at case dur
ing most of the game, the Trojans
succeeding only occasionally in
tightening up the opposition.
liowe Leads Scorers
Howe of Stanford led in scoring
honors, driving in six counts; his
teammates, Boothe and Lewis, ral
lied five apiece, while Carter ac
counted for four. Perhaps the most
striking feature of the game was the
spectacular riding of Lewis, who
seemed to ride off his opponents just
as he pleased. The Trojans evidently
were not entirely at their ease
mounted on the unfamiliar Stanford
ponies; there were no spills, how
ever, in the course of the play.
U.S.C. Inexperienced
The main defect of the Southern
players was their lack of experience;
their hitting was at times very in
effective and their teamwork was
often poor. However, the Trojan
polo team was but recently formed
and may be expected to show im
provement in time. The game Satur
day was the last of a two-game
series, the first ever held between
Stanford and U.S.C.
