# SOVIETS TO INSTALL NEW WAGE SYSTEM
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Apr. 19 (/P).—A new
| wage system, known as the "khoz
■ raschiot," which apparently changes
! the Soviet government's policy, will
I be introduced May 1. The wages of
j workers will not be based on the
communistic theory of equal divi
sion but on the capitalistic idea of
rewarding individual efforts on skill
J and ability.
j The word khozraschiot literally
: means "economic accounting." It is
I interpreted in the government de
cree to mean that each factory, col
lective farm, railroad and such
I henceforth must take the responsi
bility of fulfilling contracts and ad
judging wages without interferences
from trade unions.
Although certain elements view
the innovation regretfully as a com
promise with capitalists, the govern
ment hopes the system will speed
up production. Leaders see !he khoz
raschiot as tending to eliminate
waste and fix responsibility for man
agers and workers.
It is explained, as an example, that
the Stalingrad tractor plant, which
is in a most chaotic condition as to
production, must contract with the
! state collective farms for the sale of
so many tractors at an agreed price.
The government or bank advances
money to the farms for these pur
j chases, and in return receives a pro
portion of the croos.
