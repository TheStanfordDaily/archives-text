WHILE the summer quarter is an integral part of the year so far as
academic standards and requirements are concerned, it differs
somewhat in the character both of faculty and student body. Leading
educators from other institutions of America and Europe join the
faculty as visiting members; and though an increasing number of
students remain over from the spring quarter each year, there is also
a large registration of graduate students returning for work toward
advanced degrees, as well as teachers and school administrators at
tracted by the program of the School of Education.
It has been our aim that succeeding summer quarters should present
continually strengthened and closely co-ordinated culture, and at the
same time to preserve to the students sufficient freedom for the outdoor
recreation and relaxation which have their proper place in the summer
period, when the more highly organized sport activities of other
quarters are dropped.
In addition to the academic schcedule, noted lecturers in various fields
arc brought to Stanford during the summer quarter, and many interest
ing lectures are provided by visiting members of the staff. The open-air
concerts given at the Woodland Theatre at Hillsborough on eight Sun
days during the quarter provide an opportunity to hear the best in
music.
There are, then, certain advantages peculiar to the summer quarter
at Stanford, and the student who remains on for the summer can, in
addition to carrying on his program of study, look forward to what is
perhaps the best season of the year for out-door recreation.
