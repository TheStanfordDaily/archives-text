# TERMAN WILL GIVE SUMMER COURSES IN MENTAL TESTING
## 
### 
Professor Lewis M. Terman, head
of the Psychology department, will
be on duty this summer, offering
courses in his special field of mental
tests and the study of the psycho
logical factors that have influenced
the development of eminent persons.
In recent summers, although Profes
sor Terman has volunteered his aid
when he has been on the campus,
he has not been officially in active
service.
In addition, Professor Calvin P.
Stone of the Stanford faculty, Pro
fessor Warner Brown of the Univer
sity of California, and Norman Fen
ton of the Whittier State School will
hold professorial rank, while the
department staff will include a num
ber of other specialized instructors.
General students are cared for by
a wide variety of courses, and teach
ers are offered subjects particularly
adapted to their needs by the de
| partment, which will co-operate
closely with the school of education.
Professor Brown gives a course in
each of these fields.
