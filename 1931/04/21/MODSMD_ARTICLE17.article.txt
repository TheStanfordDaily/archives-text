Your vacation dreams come true
at last! And a chance to earn
"welth" at that, where "a fiew of
' the boys come to bring up their

Calif." by a female cowpuncher who
runs a "dude Ranch in the Jackson
hole Country." The letter finally

George B. Culver's office yesterday.

much better to here through the
summer months.
