# WORK STARTED ON HOOVER DAM
## Wilbur Signs Pact, Time Limit Seven Years 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (/P). —
Secretary Wilbur gave the "go" sig
nal today to the constructors of the
giant Hoover Dam on the Colorado
river.
He signed the $48,890,995 contract
—largest ever made by the govern
ment —under which Six Companies,
Incorporated, will harness the Colo
rado to furnish electric power and
water to distant cities and to the
barren desert areas adjoining the
canyon.
Bechtel Present
, The document already bore the
signatures of officials of the con
tracting firm and of the Reclamation
Bureau. W. A. Bechtel, vice-presi
dent of Six Companies, was at his
elbow as he signed. He later said he
expected to have one thousand men
at work within 90 days. At the
peak of construction some 2,500 will
be employed.
Six Companies have not been idle
while awaiting signature. Already
something like a quarter of a million
has been spent at the dam site,
erecting bunk houses, laying out
roads and railways. Seven years is
estimated to finish the j0b5—2,565
days to be exact. At the end of that
time if the work is not done the
contractors will have to pay the gov
ernment $3,000 a day until it is
finished.
Tunnels First Job
The first task the contractors arc
tackling is the boring of four tunnels
below the river level, flanking the
site of the dam. These will be 56
feet wide, lined with 3 feet of con
crete. Through them the river will
be diverted by means of cofferdams
100 feet high while the foundations
of the permanent dam are laid. La
ter they will become part of the
power plant.
Bechtel said his company was now
seeking to establish a wage base for
its workers that would be "liberal."
"We fdel that we could make con
siderable savings on the job by
keeping down the wage level, but
since this is a public job we would
like to establish a good, liberal figure
that would serve as a standard all
over the country and would con
tribute somewhat to restoring pros
perity," he said.
