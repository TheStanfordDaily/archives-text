# ADVANCE DATA PROMISES FINE SUMMER TERM
## Co-ordinated Program Of Studies To Feature Next Quarter SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED History Offers Varied And Interesting List 
### 
From all indications available now,
summer quarter attendance this ye;<r
will be at least as large as it was
last year, with a possibility that it
will be the largest recorded since
Stanford began the four - quarter
system, in the opinion of Dean John
A. Sellards.
The most notable feature of this
year's program, he thinks, is the
well-rounded and co-ordinated pro
gram of studies. A full schedule of
courses is provided, Dean Sellards
says, for the regular Stanford stu
dent as well as for the advanced
and graduate student seeking spe
cialized work.
Social Science Complete
From the required Citizenship
i course and the standard elementary
courses in such departments as eco
! nomics, sociology, and other social
sciences, the needs of the students
carrying out a program for the A.B.
degree and desiring to save a
quarter have been kept in mind.
In histoi-y and English and the
modern foreign languages particu
larly abundant and varied courses
! are offered, Dean Sellards points
i out.
"For students majoring in history,"
he says, "there are two fields of un
usual interest to be covered this
summerâ€”Russian and Byzantine.
"For those interested in modern
languages, there will be instruction
by native teachers in French, Span
ish, and German, and courses con
ducted in those languages by native
lecturers.
Good Language Courses
The student who seeks an oppor
tunity to improve his speaking
I knowledge of the languages has an
especially good chance in summer,
when groups are formed for practice
in speaking French, Spanish, and
German. Russian is also a part of
the summer program, with courses
in Slavic Civilization and Russian
Realism, in addition to work in the
language. In addition to classroom
work and the language tables, pub
lic lectures will be offered in French,
j Spanish, and German."
Dean Sellards also notes that this
I summer elementary courses in phys
iology and bacteriology will be avail
able on the campus. Hitherto nat
ural science instruction in the sum
mer has been concentrated at the
Hopkins Marine Station.
As is customary in the summer
the University as such takes a more
active share in promoting the social
life and recreations of the students
than in the other quarters. Dean
! Sellards has arranged for social
' gatherings, the departments of phys
ical education carry out schedules of
j sports contests, and in addition there
j are trips to nearby points of inter
est, musical programs, including the
Sunday afternoon symphonies at
Hillsborough, to which students
have especial rates, and several se
ries of lectures on different subjects,
j open to the general University pu
-1 lie.
