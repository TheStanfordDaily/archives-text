To Willis A. Sutton, president of the National Kduca
lion Association, should go the Prohibition Party's presi
dential nomination or' something of equal importance for
his contribution to the nation's thought, delivered last week
before the Georgia Parent-Teacher Association.
Business depression, Sutton said, had one of its causes
in birth control. "We used to have lots of children, but we
have only a few now," the noted educator declared. "Think
of the buying power of the families when they had eight
to fifteen children. Now we have dwindled down to one
child, maybe two, and they don't require so much."
The Duly has heretofore not given the question a
thought, but in view of Sutton's remarks, it hereby goes on
lecord as favoring the birth control movement. Any cam
paign which numbers among its opponents a man with
Sutton's analytical ability deserves the whole-souled sup
port of every loyal Stanford student.
