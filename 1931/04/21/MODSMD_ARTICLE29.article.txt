# CALIFORNIA'S SCREAMING EAGLE
## 
### 
As was to be expected. Senator Hiram W. Johnson's
voice has been raised in loud protest against the federal
government's action in ordering the withdrawal of t'.S.
marines from the interior of Nicaragua. California's senior
senator declared that the t oiled States was inviting "as
sassination of innocent Americans and others by Nica
laguans and taking the humiliating position of saying we
cannot protect the lives of our citizens."
Hiram's remarks of course were ased on his worn-out
war cry of "America for the Americans," which always
carries with il the implication of "to hell with everybody
outside the good old t'.S.A."
Il worries Johnson to think of American citizens in the
Niearaguan interior unprotected by federal marines. Those
citizens went to Nicaragua and they invested in Nica
i aguan industry and agriculture. They asked fort '.S. pro
tection, and they got it, although they knew before they
went there what type of country Nicaragua was and that
conditions were not the same as in North America.
Hundreds of marines have been required to aid these
individuals in exploiting Nicaragua, supposedly a sover
eign country. The same imperialistic policy which gave the
I'nited States the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and
California has been boldly pursued in Latin America and
the Caribbean to give us economic control, at least, of these
regions.
And now Senator Johnson yelps about America for the
Americans and speaks of our taking the humiliating posi
tion of saying we cannot protect the lives of our citizens
citizens who demand marines to back up their commer
cial exploitation of Nicaragua.
Perhaps, il may never have occurred to Johnson, who
has only served in the t .S. Senate for some 20 years, that
there may be a few citizens of the Latin American republic
who dare to think of a Nicaragua for the Nicaraguans.
Animals are queer. You never see a herd of hungry
deer gazing at a field of grass wherein one full deer wor
ries about his surplus. The Duiltj lllim'.
The editorial stall' will meet at I: 10 o'clock lodav in
The Dati.y office.
