# RETURNS SWAMP ADVERTISER FOR "SCHOOL MA'AM"
## 
### 
Dan Cupid, working through
his campus agency, the col
umns of the Daily, has brought
his client from Watts to the
state of a near break-down due
to the answers he has received
to his publicity in the paper
last week.
The advertisement which
called for correspondence pref
erably from a "school ma'am"
was misread by several people
to be "school man," and con
sequently answers to the call
have been flowing into Watts
from lonely swains all over
northern California.
The would -be bridegroom
has written to the Daily for
help, suggesting that the staff
by proper manipulation of the
letters (which he sent to the
editor) should be able to get
all the "lady teachers and half
the co-eds married off by vaca
tion time."
Members of the 500, here's
your cluinee!
