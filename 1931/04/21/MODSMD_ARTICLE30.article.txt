# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
The reputed champion cigarette
smoker of Europe was recently de
throned, and Spain now enters into
the doubtful blessings of democracy
—doubtful that is, if we are to be
lieve those fascinating cynics who
live under a popular form of gov
ernment themselves.
King Alfonso XIII was a nice
enough man as far as we know. He
had a nice string of polo ponies,
several speedy automobiles, and a
welcome smile for the dollars of
American tourists. What more can
one ask from a monarch? But Al
fonso was not content to'stuy on his
ponies and behind the wheel of his
roadster. He was ambitious to be a
king in fact as well as in name.
Ambitious men have curious fates—
Coolidge was elected president;
Caesar was murdered; Fitts was de
feated for the governorship; and Al
fonso was forced to flee Spain.
Some Americans living in Amer
ica regret that the King of Spain
is no more. They feel that the
glamour and romance attached to
royalty should at least have been
maintained in Spain—the land of
castles, dark-eyed senoritas, caston
ets, and very old wine. These indi
viduals feel there is added a de
lightful touch of the "different" in
having a King instead of an ordin
ary individual at the head of the
government. Let us repeat that such
people are only viewing Spain as a
place to spend vacations, and not as
I a permanent home.

| We do not feel that the Almighty
first created the world, then man,
and finally culminated his work
manship with democratic govern
ment. Everybody recognizes ihat
i our form of government has numer
ous faults. It is not the land of equal
' opportunity. Opportunity here, how
ever, is determined by ability to
j some extent. Even a dictator or a
self-made emperor like Napoleon
has something to be said in his
favor. But in Spain, it was different.
| Here was a man who came into of
fice by virtue of birth; and who held
j office by the tradition surrounding
his dead ancestors.
' It is indeed significant that the
■ "revolution" was peaceful—indica
tion it might seem of the unanimity
of public opinion in regard to the
advisability of maintaining the
King. It might seem cruel to place
j the weighty condemnation of the
Bull Session on a man who has been
\ forcet? from his home, but we can-
I not help feeling that the people of
! Spain deserve congratulations for
entering the democratic family of
nations. Democracy has been de
fined as that type of government
where everybody gets what they
want, and then are not satisfied.
Monarchy is just one step worse for
then people are not satisfied, but
they cannot even have the psycho
logical pleasure of getting what they
want.
