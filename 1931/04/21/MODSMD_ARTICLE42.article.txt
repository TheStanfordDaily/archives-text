# SIDELINE SLANTS

### 
Last clown and two to go. That's
the way the varsity baseball situa
tion lies right now. With all its
games with major contenders dead
and gone, Stanford's baseball var
sity faces only two games with the
weak San Francisco University nine
to win its first conference title since
the establishment of the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Association
six years ago.
The Cards have won 13 league
contests and dropped .'!, to lead
the other six members of the
association with an average of
Next in line is IJ.S.C. with
10 victories and 4 defeats. Then
follows California, which has
finished with l.'J wins and 5
losses.
Thus, by mathematical reasoning,
Stanford could lose one of the two
games with S.F.U. and still get at
least a tie out of the mess. And con
sidering that Troy still has a game
with the fast-improving St. Mary's
aggregation and three tussles with
the tiring, but by no means down
and-out U.C.LA. Bruins, there ap
pears an exceptionally line chance
that the Trojans will drop one of
the four games. In this case, Stan
ford could lose both S.F.U. tilts and
still tie for a title.
Figuring on in (his manner,
we'll soon come to the conclu
sion that Stanford could even
protest one of the Cat games,
give Berkeley one of our vic
tories, and still come out ahead.
At any rate, things look ex
tremely in the vermillion for a
conference pennant.
And, of course, Coach Harry Wol
ter will make very sure that Stan
ford does not drop even one of the
qames to San Francisco University.
But mistakes happen in the best of
families, and one never can be too
sure. There's many a slip between
third and home, and the game's not
over until the last man has been put
:>ut. (Proverbs from experience,
I3:viii).
To put the first crimp into the
awaited pennant, Bert Delmas stuck
his finger into a nail lying around
•second base last Saturday and now
lis hand is infected, with the result
hat he will be definitely out of the
first S.F.U. clash here tomorrow,
and chances are that he will not see
iction in the second struggle billed
or the local diamond Saturday.
Cutshaw will pincli-hit for the
varsity shortstop, and Cutshaw
isn't a poor player by any means.
But Delmas, in addition to being
one of the best infielders seen
around these parts for some
time, may truthfully be said to
be the surest and most consist
ent batter on the Stanford out
fit.
Burt may not have the batting
tverage some of the others have,
jut he is beyond a doubt the hard
st man for an opposing twirler to
litch to. He is the fastest runner on
he team, the best bunter, and does
lis best hitting in the pinches.
Delmas or no Delmas, how
ever. the Ignatians should not be
able to hold the Indians. Wolter
will probably use Dan Johnson
for the Saturday fracas to make
victory as sure as possible, and
the often-used Johnson may
quite possibly get in for a cou
ple of innings in tomorrow's
game.
Loomis, Riede, IVlillsap, Cad
del, and Eddie may all get into
tomorrow's clash, with odds fa
voring the first two named. Riede
won glory for himself last Fri
day when, after warming the
bench for two years and all of
this year up to date, he went in
to pitch his first game with the
bases loaded and no outs called.
Hal mastered the situation and
retired the side without allow
ing a run, a feat that no Stan
ford pitcher has done in many
a moon.
Batting averages have gone way
p during the past few games with
intala hitting .583 in the California
•ries alone; and that against Hor
?r, leading conference pitcher last
jar. Philippi, Johnson, Hardy,
unken, Campbell, and Miller are
1 aiding in lifting the depression
om the horsehide industry and
ould continue to boost their counts
,'ainst the talents of the Ignatian
oundsmen.
Turn out for the last two and
watch the hoys bring home the
bacon. As the Governor of North
Carolina said to the Governor
of South Carolina ....

finished with l.'J wins and 5
losses.
Thus, by mathematical reasoning,
Stanford could lose one of the two
games with S.F.U. and still get at
least a tie out of the mess. And con
sidering that Troy still has a game
with the fast-improving St. Mary's
aggregation and three tussles with
the tiring, but by no means down
and-out U.C.LA. Bruins, there ap
pears an exceptionally line chance
that the Trojans will drop one of
the four games. In this case, Stan
ford could lose both S.F.U. tilts and
still tie for a title.
Figuring on in (his manner,
we'll soon come to the conclu
sion that Stanford could even
protest one of the Cat games,
give Berkeley one of our vic
tories, and still come out ahead.
At any rate, things look ex
tremely in the vermillion for a
conference pennant.
And, of course, Coach Harry Wol
ter will make very sure that Stan
ford does not drop even one of the
qames to San Francisco University.
But mistakes happen in the best of
families, and one never can be too
sure. There's many a slip between
third and home, and the game's not
over until the last man has been put
:>ut. (Proverbs from experience,
I3:viii).
To put the first crimp into the
awaited pennant, Bert Delmas stuck
his finger into a nail lying around
•second base last Saturday and now
lis hand is infected, with the result
hat he will be definitely out of the
first S.F.U. clash here tomorrow,
and chances are that he will not see
iction in the second struggle billed
or the local diamond Saturday.
Cutshaw will pincli-hit for the
varsity shortstop, and Cutshaw
isn't a poor player by any means.
But Delmas, in addition to being
one of the best infielders seen
around these parts for some
time, may truthfully be said to
be the surest and most consist
ent batter on the Stanford out
fit.
Burt may not have the batting
tverage some of the others have,
jut he is beyond a doubt the hard
st man for an opposing twirler to
litch to. He is the fastest runner on
he team, the best bunter, and does
lis best hitting in the pinches.
Delmas or no Delmas, how
ever. the Ignatians should not be
able to hold the Indians. Wolter
will probably use Dan Johnson
for the Saturday fracas to make
victory as sure as possible, and
the often-used Johnson may
quite possibly get in for a cou
ple of innings in tomorrow's
game.
Loomis, Riede, IVlillsap, Cad
del, and Eddie may all get into
tomorrow's clash, with odds fa
voring the first two named. Riede
won glory for himself last Fri
day when, after warming the
bench for two years and all of
this year up to date, he went in
to pitch his first game with the
bases loaded and no outs called.
Hal mastered the situation and
retired the side without allow
ing a run, a feat that no Stan
ford pitcher has done in many
a moon.
Batting averages have gone way

Figuring on in (his manner,
we'll soon come to the conclu
sion that Stanford could even
protest one of the Cat games,
give Berkeley one of our vic
tories, and still come out ahead.
At any rate, things look ex
tremely in the vermillion for a
conference pennant.
And, of course, Coach Harry Wol
ter will make very sure that Stan
ford does not drop even one of the
qames to San Francisco University.
But mistakes happen in the best of
families, and one never can be too
sure. There's many a slip between
third and home, and the game's not
over until the last man has been put
:>ut. (Proverbs from experience,
I3:viii).
To put the first crimp into the
awaited pennant, Bert Delmas stuck
his finger into a nail lying around
•second base last Saturday and now
lis hand is infected, with the result
hat he will be definitely out of the
first S.F.U. clash here tomorrow,
and chances are that he will not see
iction in the second struggle billed
or the local diamond Saturday.
Cutshaw will pincli-hit for the
varsity shortstop, and Cutshaw
isn't a poor player by any means.
But Delmas, in addition to being
one of the best infielders seen
around these parts for some
time, may truthfully be said to
be the surest and most consist
ent batter on the Stanford out
fit.
Burt may not have the batting
tverage some of the others have,
jut he is beyond a doubt the hard
st man for an opposing twirler to
litch to. He is the fastest runner on
he team, the best bunter, and does
lis best hitting in the pinches.
Delmas or no Delmas, how
ever. the Ignatians should not be
able to hold the Indians. Wolter
will probably use Dan Johnson
for the Saturday fracas to make
victory as sure as possible, and
the often-used Johnson may
quite possibly get in for a cou
ple of innings in tomorrow's
game.
Loomis, Riede, IVlillsap, Cad
del, and Eddie may all get into
tomorrow's clash, with odds fa
voring the first two named. Riede
won glory for himself last Fri
day when, after warming the
bench for two years and all of
this year up to date, he went in
to pitch his first game with the
bases loaded and no outs called.
Hal mastered the situation and
retired the side without allow
ing a run, a feat that no Stan
ford pitcher has done in many
a moon.
Batting averages have gone way
p during the past few games with
intala hitting .583 in the California
•ries alone; and that against Hor
?r, leading conference pitcher last
jar. Philippi, Johnson, Hardy,
unken, Campbell, and Miller are
1 aiding in lifting the depression
om the horsehide industry and
ould continue to boost their counts
,'ainst the talents of the Ignatian
oundsmen.
Turn out for the last two and
watch the hoys bring home the
bacon. As the Governor of North
Carolina said to the Governor
of South Carolina ....
