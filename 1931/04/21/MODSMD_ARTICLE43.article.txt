# Injuries Jeopardize Varsity Nine's Prospects
## CUTSHAW TO PLAY SHORT FOR CARDS AGAINST GRAY FOG Wolter Undecided About Pitching For S.F.U. Game Wednesday 
### Francis LloyD 
| Injuries suddenly made their ap-
J pearance among the members of the
| Stanford baseball squad over last
j week-end when Burt Delmas ran a
j nail into his hand during the prog
ress of the California game, and Jim
Eddie suffered a torn muscle in his
throwing arm.
Although treatment was given im
mediately to Delmas' hand, infection
set in which may prevent his play
i ing in one or possibly both of the
| San Francisco University games,
| which are to be played on Wednes-
I day and Saturday. Eddie is definite-
I ly out for the remainder of the year.
Cutshaw to Play Short
: Shortstop will be filled by Max
; Cutshaw, who has been regular
utility infielder on the squad this
season. Cutshaw. is a good handler
of ground balls and can hit at a
j good clip; however, his arm lacks
power and he may find it difficult
' to throw out a fast runner.
Pitching is again the problem
which confronts Harry Wolter on
the eve of Stanford's first confer
ence pennant. It is more than likely
that Dan Johnson will be called to
pitch a few innings of Wednesday's
game as well as go the route on
Saturday at Recreation Park.
Riede May Pitch
1 Showing good control in his first
varsity start, Hal Riede will un
doubted ly see some action before
the close of the week. Riede should
have more confidence in himself
after his one bit of experience, and
; should be able to give a good ac
count of himself.
i Always good for several innings,
i Vard Loomis should not be forgot
i ten as a very likely possibility to get
! the call on Wednesday. This leaves
1 Harry Wolter with Ernie Caddel and
| Frank Milsap in reserve.
Rintala Stars in Practice
i Hitting in practice was again fea
tured by the heavy clouting of Rin
l tala who amassed the extraordinary
J total of 7 for 12 hits during the
California series. It should be re
j membered that these hits were made
I off Horner, who until he met Stan
ford this year was undefeated.
Last Saturday's victory can be ac
i counted for in no small, measure by
the general all-round play of Spud
"Hardy, who not only fielded well
around the first sack but was also
I responsible for three of the hits
made by the Indians in the last
; California game.

Although treatment was given im
mediately to Delmas' hand, infection
set in which may prevent his play
i ing in one or possibly both of the
| San Francisco University games,
| which are to be played on Wednes-
I day and Saturday. Eddie is definite-
I ly out for the remainder of the year.
Cutshaw to Play Short
: Shortstop will be filled by Max
; Cutshaw, who has been regular
utility infielder on the squad this
season. Cutshaw. is a good handler
of ground balls and can hit at a
j good clip; however, his arm lacks
power and he may find it difficult
' to throw out a fast runner.
Pitching is again the problem
which confronts Harry Wolter on
the eve of Stanford's first confer
ence pennant. It is more than likely
that Dan Johnson will be called to
pitch a few innings of Wednesday's
game as well as go the route on
Saturday at Recreation Park.
Riede May Pitch
1 Showing good control in his first
varsity start, Hal Riede will un
doubted ly see some action before
the close of the week. Riede should
have more confidence in himself
after his one bit of experience, and
; should be able to give a good ac
count of himself.
i Always good for several innings,
i Vard Loomis should not be forgot
i ten as a very likely possibility to get
! the call on Wednesday. This leaves
1 Harry Wolter with Ernie Caddel and
| Frank Milsap in reserve.
Rintala Stars in Practice
i Hitting in practice was again fea
tured by the heavy clouting of Rin
l tala who amassed the extraordinary
J total of 7 for 12 hits during the
California series. It should be re
j membered that these hits were made
I off Horner, who until he met Stan
ford this year was undefeated.
Last Saturday's victory can be ac
i counted for in no small, measure by
the general all-round play of Spud
"Hardy, who not only fielded well
around the first sack but was also
I responsible for three of the hits
made by the Indians in the last
; California game.
| Injuries suddenly made their ap-
J pearance among the members of the
| Stanford baseball squad over last
j week-end when Burt Delmas ran a
j nail into his hand during the prog
ress of the California game, and Jim
Eddie suffered a torn muscle in his
throwing arm.
