# INDIANS ENTER ENTIRE SQUAD IN P.A.A. MEET
## Olympic Club Will Offer Most Opposition To Stanford Team 
### 
By Lowell Cox
AVith California safely out of the
way, Dink Templcton's track forces
will settle down this afternoon to
the serious business of preparing for
the P.A.A. meet in San Francisco
next Saturday.
Stanford will be represented by a
full team in the annual Kezar sta
dium meet, it was announced here
yesterday.
While many central California
schools and clubs will be repre
sented, the Olympic Club is ex
pected to furnish the Indian track
men with their only serious team
competition.
Winged "O" Dangerous
Although Stanford has already
registered a decisive 88V2 to 42 V 2
victory over the Winged "O," the
addition of several freak events in
Saturday's meet, in which the Farm
will not be represented, may tend to
equalize matters. The Club should
score heavily in such events as the
hammer throw, hop-skip-and-jump,
and 56-pound weight.
Yesterday's practice session was a
mild affair, with the entire squad
taking it easy. Adding to Indian
hopes for the forthcoming U.S.C.
meet was the appearance of Rudy
Rintala armed with a javelin.
Itintala Throws Javelin
Rintala, who "throws a tremen
dous peg from center field for the
ball team, tossed the spear past the
170-foot mark yesterday
trying too hard. Templeton was
moved to remark that Rudy should
reach 190 feet by May 2, which
would allow the Trojans no better
than third place in this event, and
might push them out of it entirely.
Rintala having had experience
throwing the javelin as a freshman,
it would seem that there is ample
ground for Templeton's prediction.
Apparently fearful that DeGroot's
surprising vault of 13 feet 6 inches
for first place last Saturday might
attract too much attention, the "Boy
Coach" took a fling at the event
himself yesterday. Even Bill Elling
ton tried it.
Templeton Pole Vaults
Starting at seven feet, Templeton,
who claimed he had not had a pole
in his hands "for 1G years," wobbled
over to collect from numerous on
lookers who doubted his boasts. El
lington, however, failed to make the
grade and dropped out.
Templeton kept going until he
reached nine feet, collecting at every
Peg
"Bet you can't make 14 feet," said
DeGroot, when Dink showed signs
of weakening.
"Tomorrow!" replied Templeton.
But 111 settle with ,>ou in the dress
ing room tonight."

Winged "O" Dangerous
Although Stanford has already
registered a decisive 88V2 to 42 V 2
victory over the Winged "O," the
addition of several freak events in
Saturday's meet, in which the Farm
will not be represented, may tend to
equalize matters. The Club should
score heavily in such events as the
hammer throw, hop-skip-and-jump,
and 56-pound weight.
Yesterday's practice session was a
mild affair, with the entire squad
taking it easy. Adding to Indian
hopes for the forthcoming U.S.C.
meet was the appearance of Rudy
Rintala armed with a javelin.
Itintala Throws Javelin
Rintala, who "throws a tremen
dous peg from center field for the
ball team, tossed the spear past the
170-foot mark yesterday
trying too hard. Templeton was
moved to remark that Rudy should
reach 190 feet by May 2, which
would allow the Trojans no better
than third place in this event, and
might push them out of it entirely.
Rintala having had experience
throwing the javelin as a freshman,
it would seem that there is ample
ground for Templeton's prediction.
Apparently fearful that DeGroot's
surprising vault of 13 feet 6 inches
for first place last Saturday might
attract too much attention, the "Boy
Coach" took a fling at the event
himself yesterday. Even Bill Elling
ton tried it.
Templeton Pole Vaults
Starting at seven feet, Templeton,
who claimed he had not had a pole
in his hands "for 1G years," wobbled
over to collect from numerous on
lookers who doubted his boasts. El
lington, however, failed to make the
grade and dropped out.
Templeton kept going until he
reached nine feet, collecting at every
Peg
"Bet you can't make 14 feet," said
DeGroot, when Dink showed signs
of weakening.
"Tomorrow!" replied Templeton.
But 111 settle with ,>ou in the dress
ing room tonight."

AVith California safely out of the
way, Dink Templcton's track forces
will settle down this afternoon to
the serious business of preparing for
the P.A.A. meet in San Francisco
next Saturday.
Stanford will be represented by a
full team in the annual Kezar sta
dium meet, it was announced here
yesterday.
While many central California
schools and clubs will be repre
sented, the Olympic Club is ex
pected to furnish the Indian track
men with their only serious team
competition.
