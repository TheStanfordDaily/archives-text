# FROSH GOLFER WINS QUARTER FINAL POSITION
## Brown Downs Hawley One Up; Two Brackets Still Unoccupied 
### 
I Another varsity golfer fell before
the fine shot making of a freshman
yesterday, when Gene Brown de-
I feated Stuart Hawley, 1 up, to gain
! the quarter-finals of the University
tournament.
Although Hawley is the sixth
ranking man on the varsity squad,
I his defeat was not altogether un
; expected. Brown, fourth man on
i the strong freshman team, already
, had a decision over Lawson Little
to his credit.
I Only two quarter-final brackets
, now remain unoccupied. Lawson
i Little has to beat George Edmonds
! to gain one; Charlie Seaver faces
I Jack Hoerner, with the remaining
; place at stake. All four are fresh-
I men; so if either Little or Seaver
' should be upset, there will still be
iour yearlings among the last eight.
Malcolm MacNaughton, recent
! winner of the California intercolle
| giate title; Jerry Trautman, who is
ranked as second freshman ahead of
| Little; Richie Stevenson, varsity
' captain; Herman Hellman, ranked
I number five, and Harry Eichelber
'■ ger, ranked number two, are the
I men who have already carved a
i place for themselves in the quarter
! finals.
