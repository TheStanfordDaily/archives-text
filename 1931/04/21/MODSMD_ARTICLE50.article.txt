# ENTRANTS NEEDED IN MIXED DOUBLES TOURNAMENT MAY 1
## 
### 
Prizes have been chosen! Entry
lists are posted! Tennis officials are
ready to draw up the schedules! But
there are no players!
That is the situation facing Elwyn
Bugge, director of tennis, on this
tennis-playing Stanford "farm," as
May 1, the opening date for the an
nual spring mixed doubles tennis
tournament, rapidly approaches.
A minimum of sixteen couples
must enter, or there will be no tour
ney, no prizes, states Director Bugge
most emphatically, as he urges that
all prospective entrants choose their
partners immediately and start prac
ticing. But essential though practice
may be, entering the tournament
is even more important.
Entry lists are of course provided
for this purpose, and will be found
posted in both Roble and Encina
gymnasiums. All women players
who intend to enter the tournament,
but who do not have partners should
sign up on the Roble list.
The men will sign up for them
selves and their partners in Encina
gym, and a list will be available
there for any men who have not
secured a partner. Any student is
eligible and all are invited to enter
the tourney.
