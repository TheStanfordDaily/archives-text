# MALONEY TRAINING SOCCER SQUAD IN NEW TEAM PLAYS
## Coach Handicapped by Loss Of 9 of 11 Regulars Still Confident 
### 
Under Coach Maloney's watchful
eye, the soccer men swung into full
stride as the second week of spring
practice got under way yesterday.
Maloney is faced with the serious
problem of losing 9 of the 11 regu
lars who played on last year's team,
but with typical Maloney optimism
he is hard at work trying out a
couple of new training systems and
feels confident that he will have an
excellent team lined up by the time
competition begins this fall.
There is plenty of good material
out in uniform this spring, and al
though he plans to put his men
through light workouts only three
times a week, Maloney is giviqg the
men more concentrated instruction
on the fundamentals of the game
than has been customary in the past.
He accomplishes this purpose by
having the candidates for the vari
ous positions work together in
groups, centering their attention
particularly on footwork to im
prove their pat-sing and shooting.
Maloney is already looking for
ward as far as 1932. The. men who
will probably be called upon to rep
resent Stanford in that year are
playing together at the present time.
They scrimmage with a team com
posed partly of those regulars who
will play their last games for Stan
ford in the coming fall season. This
plan will give the new men valu
able experience in working together
as a unit, so that the loss of regu
lars will not be so keenly felt.
