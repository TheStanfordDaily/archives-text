# LAW SCHOOL WILL GIVE COURSES FOR SUMMER STUDENTS
## Beginners Can Cover Work Of Year by Intense Quarter's Study 
### 
Provision is made by the Law
School in its summer quarter pro
gram both for those beginning the
study of law and for advanced stu
dents. For the beginners of profes
sional study the work offered—Con
tracts, by Professor Judson Adams
Crane of the University of Pitts
burgh, and Personal Property, by
Professor George E. Osborne of the
regular Stanford faculty—will en
able them to continue their work in
the autumn without delay of con
flict.
By this arrangement students may,
if they wish, complete the course
for the professional degree in less
than the usual number of calendar
months.
Concentrated Work
Contracts is given in more con
centrated form in the summer than
in other quarters, meeting nine
times a week instead of three and
thus finishing the usual year's work
in a single quarter.
The Law School also divides the
quarter into two terms, offering
some courses in only the first or
second term, while others run
through the quarter.
Of the regular Stanford faculty,
Professor Osbdrne will teach
throughout the quarter, Professor
Sigvald Nielson will teach during
the first half, and Professors A. M.
Cathcart, Stanley Morrison, and
Lowell Turrentine during the sec
ond.

Three professors from other law
schools will give courses at Stan
ford, besides Professor Crane.
Professor Garrard Glenn of the
University of Virginia will be at
Stanford through the quarter, teach
ing Insurance and Trusts.

of the University of Pittsburgh, who
