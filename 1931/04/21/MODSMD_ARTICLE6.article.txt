# SUMMER WORK IN GEOLOGY CONFINED TO SURVEY TRIPS
## 
### 
Summer work in Geology is con
fined to the Stanford University
Gcologieal Survey, an institution
which was established by Dr. J. C.
Branner, first professor of Geology,
in 1891, when the University opened.
On this survey student groups,
under the direction of faculty men,
go into the field and by work like
that of a professional survey check
on the geological formation and re
gion being studied and prepare a
detail map and reports for publica
tion.
This summer the Stanford Survey
will work in the Santa Paula Quad
rangle, Ventura county. Dr. Paul F.
Kerr will be "Chief of Party" and
Dr. Seimon W. Muller, paleontolo
gist. Camp funds and camp manage
ment will be in the hands of Camp
Manager Chuck Ehrhorn.
The party travels to its location in
automobiles, establishes a camp as
a base of operations, and then di
vides into small parties, each* under
the direction of an experienced in
structor, for the particular studies
and maps which are ultimately com
bined into a complete topographic
and geologic map of the whole re
gion studied.
