# CORNELL PHYSICIST PRESENTS COURSES IN X-RAY RESEARCH
## 
### 
Professor Floyd K. Richtmyer of
Cornell, who was a member of the
summer quarter faculty in 1925,
comes to Stanford again to give
courses in the discoveries and
theories in physics in the last few
decades and in the results of recent
researches with regard to X-rays.
Professor P. A. Ross will super
vise experimental work in the labor
atory in X-i-ays to supplement Pro
fessor Richtinyer's lectures in that
field and will also direct intensive
reading in the literature of physics
by students preparing to become re
search workers or teachers.
A course in mathematical physics
by William W. Hansen of the Stan
ford faculty will be adapted to the
needs of graduate students taking it.
