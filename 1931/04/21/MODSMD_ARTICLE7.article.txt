# JOURNALISTIC SOCIETY TO PLAN BRIDGE TEA
## 
### 
There will be a meeting of Theta
Sigma Phi, national journalistic so
ciety for women, Thursday after
noon to make plans for its annual
bridge tea, which is the main event
of the spring quarter.
It is customary to have some
woman active in literary affairs
speak to the group on that occasion.
Last year Dr. Margery Bailey spoke
on the English ballad, and the year
before the talk was given by Kath
leen Norris.
