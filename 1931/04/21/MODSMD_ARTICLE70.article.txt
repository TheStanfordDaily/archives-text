Director Harold Helvenston left
' for the East immediately after the I
.Junior Opera production and will
1 probably make progress toward ihe
selection of this summer's plays be
: fore his return. He expects to choose ]
| from a list including O'Neill's "Be- ;
â–  yond the Horizon," Shaw's "Can- !
I dida," "The Inspector General" by j
Gogol, "The Sea Gull" by Tchekov, I
| and Rostand's "L'Aiglon."
On account of the general excel
j lence of material from which to se- I
J lect casts and the competition for j
I parts, summer quarter plays are al- I
| ways well done and popular. The j
I Theatre Workshop and Scenic Dc
i sign courses, under Director Helven
ston and Technical Director H. F.
Stover draw an excellent quality of
: students, supporting these produc- |
I tions and there is a full program of
: courses covering the drama and vo
: cal expression under these two and
