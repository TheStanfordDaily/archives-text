# DRIVE TO AID CHARITY FUND STARTS SOON
## Baumgarten Is Chairman Of Annual Convalescent Home Campaign 
### 
With (he appointment of Bob j
I Baumgarten as general chairman of j
the A.S.S.U. committee in charge of I
the 1931 Stanford Convalescent
Home Drive, plans for the drive to I
i take place May 4, 5, and G got under '
way yesterday with the announce- <
j ment by Baumgarten of the heads
of the various committees which will
j assist him.
The Stanford Convalescent Home, j
"Our Own Charity," occupies 26
acres of the old Stanford Homesite. i
It is an entirely independent or
ganization for charitable and educa- j
; tional purposes which provides
I nursing, care, medical service, and
instruction for convalescent children
| recruited from the bay counties. For j
the furthering of this purpose an an- J
nual appeal is made to students only, |
i whose subscriptions contribute to 1
! the maintenance of the children in |
the Home.
$4,000 Goal
Last year Stanford students raised i
$3800 from the various living groups 1
j and the concessions and entertain- !
ments on Labor Day. The high mark j
j was set in 1929 by a subscription
of $4000 which the A.S.S.U. hopes
to top with the results of this year's
appeal.
A three-day campaign for funds
will take place on the campus start
ing on May 4 and culminating with
Labor Day, May 6. It is hoped that j
j the University will grant a half- ,
holiday so that the entire campus i
may turn out early for its annual
pilgrimage to the Home where stu
; dents will cut grass, paint and re-
I pair toys, wash windows, and sell
i ice cream to swell the fund.

With (he appointment of Bob j

the 1931 Stanford Convalescent
Home Drive, plans for the drive to I
i take place May 4, 5, and G got under '
way yesterday with the announce- <
j ment by Baumgarten of the heads
of the various committees which will
j assist him.
The Stanford Convalescent Home, j
"Our Own Charity," occupies 26
acres of the old Stanford Homesite. i
It is an entirely independent or
ganization for charitable and educa- j
; tional purposes which provides
I nursing, care, medical service, and
instruction for convalescent children
| recruited from the bay counties. For j
the furthering of this purpose an an- J
nual appeal is made to students only, |
i whose subscriptions contribute to 1
! the maintenance of the children in |
the Home.
$4,000 Goal
Last year Stanford students raised i
$3800 from the various living groups 1
j and the concessions and entertain- !
ments on Labor Day. The high mark j
j was set in 1929 by a subscription
of $4000 which the A.S.S.U. hopes
to top with the results of this year's
appeal.
A three-day campaign for funds
will take place on the campus start
ing on May 4 and culminating with
Labor Day, May 6. It is hoped that j
j the University will grant a half- ,
holiday so that the entire campus i
may turn out early for its annual
pilgrimage to the Home where stu
; dents will cut grass, paint and re-
I pair toys, wash windows, and sell
i ice cream to swell the fund.
