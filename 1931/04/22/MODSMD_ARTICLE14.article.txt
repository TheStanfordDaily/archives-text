# TRAFFIC LIGHTS CAUSE DISPUTE
## State Defied In Erection Of Highway Signals 
### 
With the state highway commis
sion saying "No" and the Santa
Clara County board of supervisors
saying "Yes," the City of Palo Alto
and the University are rapidly com
i plcting the joint installation of traf
; fic lights at the intersection of Palm
Drive with El Camino Real, disre
! garding the rumblings of a brewing
conflict.
The latest development in the
i months-old controversy involving
I University, city, county, and state
I is the nullification yesterday of the
state commission's permit for the
installation, granted several weeks
I ago. A. V. Youens, Palo Alto city
' electrician, said last night, however,
I that work on the lights will con
| tinue under the authority of the
i county board of supervisors, to
whom the city and the University
! appealed early in March when the
| state first attempted to exercise its
j control.
At that time the supervisors
! passed an ordinance giving Palo
| Alto the police powers over the
i highway intersection, and ordering
the city to go ahead >y'th the in
stallation of the type of lights al
ready purchased by the University.
The state commission had just pre
viously granted the permit, specify
| ing, however, a certain type of sig
nal which differed radically from
[ the one already on hand. It was
after Leon David, deputy city attor
ney, informed the commission that
the installation would be continued
that the permit was revoked:
The lights which are being erected
; now have been in storage on the
1 campus for several weeks. They ai'e
| of the four-corner post type, with
j warning signals on the highway 300
! feet from the intersection in both
' directions. These signals will flash
lon and off at all times when the
; lights are not in operation.
The control system provides for
I either manual or automatic opera
-1 tion, although the state commission,
|in its original specifications issued
j at the time of the permit, required
j manual operation at all times. It was
through a desire to avoid the ex-
I pense of hiring an operator that the
• city went against the commission's
! wishes.
j Youens said last night that the
! lights will be in operation in two
' or three days. The chief of police of
Palo Alto and David will meet with
I the board of supervisors in San Jose
Monday night to arrange a schedule
of operation for the signals. In spite
of the demands of the highway com
mission the lights will be operated
| automatically.
To avoid any similar complications
| on other main highway intersections
over which Palo Alto's jurisdiction
i might be disputed, the city already
I has taken steps to acquire property
j along one or two main roads. The
; mosl important crossing under con
i sideration is the intersection of the
j Embarcadero with the Bayshore
Highway, soon to be completed
j through the northeastern outskirts
\ of Palo Alto.
Monday the City of Palo Alto be
gan construction of a road through
the arboretum from Palm Drive to
i the new hospital on the campus. The
I road is being built without Univer
j sity assistance, and will be com
pleted in about 10 days.

With the state highway commis
sion saying "No" and the Santa
Clara County board of supervisors
saying "Yes," the City of Palo Alto
and the University are rapidly com
i plcting the joint installation of traf
; fic lights at the intersection of Palm
Drive with El Camino Real, disre
! garding the rumblings of a brewing
conflict.
The latest development in the
i months-old controversy involving
I University, city, county, and state
I is the nullification yesterday of the
state commission's permit for the
installation, granted several weeks
I ago. A. V. Youens, Palo Alto city
' electrician, said last night, however,
I that work on the lights will con
| tinue under the authority of the
i county board of supervisors, to
whom the city and the University
! appealed early in March when the
| state first attempted to exercise its
j control.
At that time the supervisors
! passed an ordinance giving Palo
| Alto the police powers over the
i highway intersection, and ordering
the city to go ahead >y'th the in
stallation of the type of lights al
ready purchased by the University.
The state commission had just pre
viously granted the permit, specify
| ing, however, a certain type of sig
nal which differed radically from
[ the one already on hand. It was
after Leon David, deputy city attor
ney, informed the commission that
the installation would be continued
that the permit was revoked:
The lights which are being erected
; now have been in storage on the
1 campus for several weeks. They ai'e
| of the four-corner post type, with
j warning signals on the highway 300
! feet from the intersection in both
' directions. These signals will flash
lon and off at all times when the
; lights are not in operation.
The control system provides for
I either manual or automatic opera
-1 tion, although the state commission,
|in its original specifications issued
j at the time of the permit, required
j manual operation at all times. It was
through a desire to avoid the ex-
I pense of hiring an operator that the
• city went against the commission's
! wishes.
j Youens said last night that the
! lights will be in operation in two
' or three days. The chief of police of
Palo Alto and David will meet with
I the board of supervisors in San Jose
Monday night to arrange a schedule
of operation for the signals. In spite
of the demands of the highway com
mission the lights will be operated
| automatically.
To avoid any similar complications
| on other main highway intersections
over which Palo Alto's jurisdiction
i might be disputed, the city already
I has taken steps to acquire property
j along one or two main roads. The
; mosl important crossing under con
i sideration is the intersection of the
j Embarcadero with the Bayshore
Highway, soon to be completed
j through the northeastern outskirts
\ of Palo Alto.
Monday the City of Palo Alto be
gan construction of a road through
the arboretum from Palm Drive to
i the new hospital on the campus. The
I road is being built without Univer
j sity assistance, and will be com
