## Democrat Stresses Farm Relief And Tariff 
### 
CHICAGO, April 21.(/P).—Declar
i ing the Hoover administration had
j made a "fiasco of farm relief," Jouett
! Shouse, Democratic leader, predicted
today the Federal Farm Board and
its operations would be one of the
principal issues in the 1932 campaign.
"Curtailment of acreage and pro
duction," said the chairman of the
i executive committee of the Demo
-1 cratic National Committee, "was the
j best remedy the Republican party
' evolved to curtail the ills of agricul
ture. They could have made a cam-
J paign for this without creating the
j farm board and appropriating $500,-
I 000.000 for its operations."
I The 1932 campaign in the farm
! belt, Shouse said, would be a refer
j enduin on the question of success or
j failure of the Farm Board operations
i and the Democratic party was "per
| fectly willing that it should be."
Discussing the tariff changes that
I would be "beneficial to agriculture,"
| Shouse said the "Hoover-Grundy
| tariff' would be made another point
I of contention for votes.
I
j The party leader, headed east after
i a visit to Pacific Coast states, said
j that he "did not minimize the irn
i portance of prohibition as an issue"
; but that he felt unemployment was
! still the major political question.
The Pacific Coast visit. Shouse said,
I "surprised me in the disappointment
I I heard expressed against the Hoover
administration." In California, he
, said, the "chagrin against Hoover was
noticeable in a remarkable degree."
