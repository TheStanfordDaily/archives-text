# Stanford Sheep To Take Opium Cure This Winter
## 
### 
i The opium habit of the campus
sheep is due to undergo a cure next
winter, since present hay-making
activities on the Farm have been
| leased to an off-campus farmer. The
sheep, owned by the Associated
Students, will feed on a diet of
store-bought hay next winter, lack
ing the stimulating ingredient of
: dried poppies, to which they have
i been accustomed since Stanford be-
I came a wildflower and wild-oat re
serve.
Assuming a mellow harvest-look,
while Eastern colleges shovel away
| ihe last vestipes of grimy snowbank,
i this campus notes the beginning of
typical Indian summer. Though most
of Stanford's wild oat hay is reaped
from fields around Encina and Wil
! bur's home, a fair portion comes
out of ihe Roble meadow. The aver
age 900-bale crop will be lessened
this year bccause of the drought, ac
! cording to Sam Mac Donald, hay
! mowing authority for the Board ol

! Athletic Control.
Twenty dollars per shock is the
; fine heretofore imposed upon stu-
I dents who burn the hay for sheer
j aesthetic joy of watching the flames
'■ leap. For the unfortunate who lights
i one shock, thereby bringing the car
| bonization of eight more, the fine
| mounts in mathematical precision.
! The leaseholder this year, not un
| derstanding student psychology, is
expected to threaten legal prosecu
tion of such students on charges of
! arson.
The Class of 1934 should be the
I first to heed this warning, since
• freshman classes in the past have
I paid heavily for the common first
! year sport of burning up hay stacks.
! The fine has gone up, the new owner
means more business than did ihe
; B.A.C. — and student pranksters
; know from searing experience how
much business the B.A.C, meant last
! year. 'Hay or pay" is the new fnrm
it's motto.
