# Possibility Of Water Famine Demands Care
## Immediate Conservation on Campus Imperative 
### 
That immediate conservation of
water on the campus is imperative
is the statement issued yesterday by â€¢
Edward H. Waterman, chief engineer
of the University, when questioned
concerning a possible shortage of
water here during the rest of the
current quarter and the summer
session.
"Records of water consumption
during past years indicate that the
water level will fall from 30 to 40 |
feet farther during this pumping j
season than in the past," Waterman 1
said.
James V. McDonald, assistant |
superintendent of buildings and
grounds, stated that there will be
no danger of extreme drought under
present indications if everybody on
the campus practices economy in the
use of grounds water. There is much
possibility for waste in lawn and j
garden watering and unless this is i
curtailed, there will be a real water
shortage in which all campus vege
tation will suffer, said McDonald. I
Searsville and Felt lakes, the two
main sources of water supply on the
campus, are way below the average
levels. Searsville lake, generally
holding 300 million gallons at this
time of year, has only 72 million
gallons at present, while Felt lake
has only 59 million gallons. It is
estimated that the Stanford golf
course, the heaviest individual con
sumer of water, will need 40 million
gallons alone to keep it in good
condition until the rainy season in
the fall.
Junior Week aquatic sports on
Lagunita are doomed this year, un
less there is a phenomenal rain in
the near future. The events will
probably be held in Encina pool.
