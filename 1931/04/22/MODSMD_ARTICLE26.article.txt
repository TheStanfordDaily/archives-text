### 
J N a fiery and forecul argument. George Shibley, called by his opponents

; paring for several months on a gen
i eral topic of the French colonial and

Mary Katherine Morris of Stan
ford and Herbert Resner of Califor
i nia selected the affirmative, while
Irving Rosenblatt and George Shib
! ley of Stanford, and George Ackley
and Richard Eakon of California
chose to defend the negative.

for his arguments, and said that

The winner of the coveted Joffre
Medal also said that France has
tried to foster hatred between the
various races in her mandates, and
has done everything to suppress the
natives. He said that instead of fol
lowing the rulings of the League of
Nations, that France has totally mis
managed her mandates. h'
Miss Morns, second-place winner
and the first woman to represent
I Stanford in this"clebate since its in
stitution in 1894, supported the
French policy by showing that in a
land of 30 religious sects and with
out experience in self-government,
it is difficult to rule with a gentle
hand. She said that the League of
i Nations has decided that the French
management of her mandates is jus
tified.
Resner, also an affirmative speak
i er, quoted facts showing that edu
cational facilities are increasing in
the mandate areas. He said France
cannot be expected to eliminate the
troublesome racial wars and the
centuries of backwardness in a few
years.
Rosenblatt Flays; Policy
Rosenblatt said that the French
mandates are the most colossal fail
ure of colonization in the last 100
years. He contended that the French
have caused rebellions by their
treachery, and have put down the
insurrections brutally. Rosenblatt
provided facts showing that educa
tion has been retarded in the French
mandate areas since the rule of the
French.
Eaken said that the Frcnch have
destroyed native life and native or
ganization, and have mistreated and
heavily taxed the inhabitants of the
mandate regions.
Ackley voiced the opinion that
France has interfered seriously with
the native government, in opposition
to the ruling of the League of Na
tions, and that France has not lived
up to her promises in regard to the •
mandates.
This is the fourth Joffre debate
Stanford has won in the last five
years, California having won last
year. Professor James G. Emerson
coached the Stanford speakers, and
Professor Henry Stuart presided at
I the debate.

J N a fiery and forecul argument. George Shibley, called by his opponents
"the orator of the desert" because of his Arabian ancestry, last night
won for Stanford the JofTre Medal debate in the Assembly Ilall against tile
University of California. Second place was awarded to Mary Katherine
Morris of Stanford, and third place to Herbert Kesner of California.
Allowed to choose either side of the subject, "Resolved, That France's
policy in her mandates has been justified," the speakers were told the
qustion only two hours before the contest began. They had been pre-

; paring for several months on a gen
i eral topic of the French colonial and
mandate policy.
Mary Katherine Morris of Stan
ford and Herbert Resner of Califor
i nia selected the affirmative, while
Irving Rosenblatt and George Shib
! ley of Stanford, and George Ackley
and Richard Eakon of California
chose to defend the negative.
Shibley took Syria as the example
for his arguments, and said that
Syria had been able to govern itself
! for over 1,000 years, and should be
allowed to do so now. He contended
1 that the numerous religious sects
are united in the desire for inde
pendence.
Woman Competes
The winner of the coveted Joffre
Medal also said that France has
tried to foster hatred between the
various races in her mandates, and
has done everything to suppress the
natives. He said that instead of fol
lowing the rulings of the League of
Nations, that France has totally mis
managed her mandates. h'
Miss Morns, second-place winner
and the first woman to represent
I Stanford in this"clebate since its in
stitution in 1894, supported the
French policy by showing that in a
land of 30 religious sects and with
out experience in self-government,
it is difficult to rule with a gentle
hand. She said that the League of
i Nations has decided that the French
management of her mandates is jus
tified.
Resner, also an affirmative speak
i er, quoted facts showing that edu
cational facilities are increasing in
the mandate areas. He said France
cannot be expected to eliminate the
troublesome racial wars and the
centuries of backwardness in a few
years.
Rosenblatt Flays; Policy
Rosenblatt said that the French
mandates are the most colossal fail
ure of colonization in the last 100
years. He contended that the French
have caused rebellions by their
treachery, and have put down the
insurrections brutally. Rosenblatt
provided facts showing that educa
tion has been retarded in the French
mandate areas since the rule of the
French.
Eaken said that the Frcnch have
destroyed native life and native or
ganization, and have mistreated and
heavily taxed the inhabitants of the
mandate regions.
Ackley voiced the opinion that
France has interfered seriously with
the native government, in opposition
to the ruling of the League of Na
tions, and that France has not lived
up to her promises in regard to the •
mandates.
This is the fourth Joffre debate
Stanford has won in the last five
