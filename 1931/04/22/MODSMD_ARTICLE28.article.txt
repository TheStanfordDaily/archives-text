Today's Campus Opinion column contains a letter from
an alumnus of Holy Cross expressing his regret that his
college was even remotely concerned in the mixup which
necessitated the shifting of the Stanford-Dartmouth game
this fall from the Harvard Stadium.
Mr. Bertsch, the alumnus, deplores the commercial as
pect of the affair, and views the attitude of the Boston Col
lege authorities, in demanding the use of the Harvard
Stadium on November 2S, as exceedingly unsportsmanlike.
The Daily is grateful to Mr. Bertsch for his letter, but it feels
that such {in explanation from Holv Cross men was un
necessary.
Any blame for the mixup must be laid at the door of the
oflicials who in arranging the Stanford-Dartmouth game
failed to make certain that there was no conflict in dates.
If Boston College and llolv Cross had a prior claim to the
Harvard Stadium, then they were surely within their rights
in exercising that claim, especially when their traditional
rivalry is taken into account. It would be«asking too much
to expect them to waive their rights in favor of two uni
versities from out of state. The entire situation is a la
mentable one, but The Daily does not feel that the athletic
authorities of the two Boston schools can be criticized for
their stand.
