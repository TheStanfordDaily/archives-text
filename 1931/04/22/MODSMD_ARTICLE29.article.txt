# TRAFFIC PROTECTION AT LAST

Al his I, alter months of delay and political interference,
automatic controls are being installed at the intersection of
Palm Drive and University Avenue with the highway. In
numerable have been the accidents which have occurred
at this dangerous crossing during the past few years, yet
political trifling has long balked all efforts of the University
and Hie City of Palo Alto to remedy the situation.
The trallic controls at this intersection until now have
been woefully inadequate, being nothing more than a pair
of arterial stop signs. No provision was made for the heavy
trallic between the University and Palo Alto which is ever
crossing the highway. Hoth the city and the University have
t. "d for months to do something about the matter, but the
red tape that arises from the relationship of California's
cities and counties to each other and to the state has con
tinually blocked ail constructive efforts to make this cross
ing safe for everyone.
Finally, and surprisingly, the red tape has been brushed
aside, and the trallic signals are being installed. The City of
Palo Alto and the University are to be congratulated on at
length forcing through Ibis needed trallic protection. It is
regrettable, however, that Ibis action could not have been
juken months ago and prevented the numerous serious acci
dents that have occurred where Palm Drive meets the high
wav.
