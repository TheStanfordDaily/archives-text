# "TONGS"â€”THEN AND NOW
## 
### 
Many, many years ago when the fraternity idea was at
first being conceived by a few founders, the foundation I
blocks were mainly the promotion of comradeship, the im-j
provement of character and the stimulation of scholarship
and intellectual attainments. Also they were much morel
exclusive and the number of men in one of these groups
then was a great deal smaller than it is now. Their member
ship consisted almost entirely of sober, thoughtful, scho- i
lastically inclined men.
During the trend of time since then, there has come a
great change, perhaps for the better, with the emphasis on
comradeship and character. Of course progress in achieve
ment and intelligence is still observed and noted. The fra- j
Icrnity brother of today is more of a "pal" and confidante
and all in all a jolly fellow. He is a person who will lend you
his last shift and not "cry around" about if.
It may be well that things have changed. In fact, if is
necessary to change and change fast to keep up with
modern litnes. It may be a commendable factor for the fra-'
Icrnily to stress character building. For all the good the
fraternity has done and is doing, it has been suggested by
some prominent educators and fraternity men of the age
that it would be a good thing for the fraternity to look back
into the past and the foundations on which it is built and
revive a bit more of the scholarship bases on which it partly
stands. Orrgnn Stale I)<iromctrr.
