# BULL SESSION

j Prohibition enforcers have de- j
j veloped a new pastime. First, it was ;
I raiding Texas Guinan's New York
night club—which came to be such
an accepted occurrence that notor
iety-seeking guests who failed to
! be included in the big "round-up" !
' are reported to have demanded the
j large cover charge back. Then the
I prohibition guards on the border
got busy, and the wet press was
i full of yarns about innocent citizens j
who happened to be crossing the
i border at GO miles per hour on rainy
nights were shot at; concurrent with i
I this, the news reels ran picture after
; picture of huge vans full of liquor
i that the alert prohibition officers
j had caught as said vans attempted j
to "slip" across the line. One would
j have imagined the liquor was being :
transported in eye-droppers.
But all this has passed, and the
i newest thing in anti-liquor activity
j is raiding college campuses. This !
affords a safe pursuit, for collegians ]
rarely carry firearms. It also satis- I
fies those people who are positive !
that the younger generation is going
to the "bow wows." Now it is, in
deed, illegal for 50 gallons of beer to
I be found in five fraternity houses
j on Ihe University of Michigan cam
l pus. It is negligible, however, when'
we consider all the liquor these of
; ficers might have found off th£
I campus. Is it sound efficiency to

! waste men's time in such activities?
: Of course, by raiding the campus,
these small-town officers could
"break" into the national press and
become saviors of the younger gen
' oration.
The only other reason that v/e
can see for this raiding is that the
fraternities had too much pride and
honor, or not enough finances to pay
; for protection. Anyone who has
j been to Michigan knows that it is
what may be called a "wet" state.
To think that the officers would pass
jup all the speakeasies that people
! claim are over-running our nation,
| to bring a large university into the
! spotlight of unfavorable publicity,
I shows- above all else a lack of good
taste.
We do not claim that open bars
■ should operate on the campuses; but
we do claim that there is something
; pathetic and petty when a govern
i ment must stoop to gather a measly
j5O gallons of beer. The future of
i Prohibition is supposed to rest in
the hands of modern youth; and
after a few more colleges are raided,
some people will begin to clasp their
hands and cry in loud dismay. But
the future is not as black as one
; might think for 50 gallons on a cam
' | pus housing several thousands is not
enough beer to give everybody a
' taste—let alone cause drunkenness.
