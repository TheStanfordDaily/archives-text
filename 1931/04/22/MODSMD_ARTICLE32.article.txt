THIS IS NEW YORK—By Robert E.
Sherwood. Scribners. 1931.
I Sherwood's preface does not
! promise the combination of lost
i ladies, pent-house raids, dumb sen
j ators, and modern youth which fol
lows. Indeed, Bob, cheeks indented
! noticeably, wails very unsherwood
i ianly of the mistrust of New York
evidenced by the rest of the United
! States.
Perhaps the bemoaned condition is
j what Sherwood seems to think it. We
rather think it was an excuse to
| construct a comedy.
As produced by Arthur Hopkins
the play was unsuccessful; as pub
lished by Scribners the satire ap
proaches farce, the situations ai'e not
j basically new, the delineations of
i gangsters, newshawks, policemen
! anything but novel. But you should
j find it amusing and—if our suspi
cions are correct — groundlessly
I amusing. —J.S.S.
LADYBROOK—By Eleanor Farjeon.
, F. A. Stokes. New York. 1931. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Blending a modern with an ancient
' tale of love at Ladybrook, in the
! Sussex-Downs, the author of "Mar
! tin Pippin in the Apple Orchard"
! has produced an unusually charm
ing romance.
Robert and Nona are drawn to
i each other through the stories that
! seventy-year-old Deborah tells them
I concerning her love for Nona's
i grandfather. Pathos and humor les
j sen the reality of a very real but
| minor tragedy in Deborah's life, and
j add sensibility to the purely ro-
I mantle elements.

| Linking the stories to each other
! and to the principle characters arc
I interludes. The effect is clevar,
j showing a peculiar repetition of iri

| cidents at different periods. Al
though "Ladybrook" is a mature
) novel, it retains the delicacy of
' style, the naive treatment of reality,
! that made "Martin Pippin" worthy
i of success. —J.N.

A VILLA IN BRITTANY—By Don
ald Moffat. Doubleday, Doran &
Company, 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
i A Villa in Brittany is not a travel
j book in the strict sense of the word,
; but one feels after reading it that
I it would be interesting as well as
j ruinous to the nerves to travel with
| the Poulters and the Motfs with
i their families of "littles."
The high point in this part of the
! book comes when Mr. Mott, left
I behind to clean up the villa, finds
i that he has to carry a "chaise per
| cee, wicker, infant, for use of"
! through the streets of the respec
; table and provincial French town.
The second part of the book has
j nothing to do with villas but tells in
| a whimsically humorous way how
i the misfortunes of social climbers
i in America made it possible for a
: little chamber maid in a French
■ hotel to "get her man."
The author has left the best until.
! the last. Part 111, entitled "Incidents
|of the French Camp," relates the
1 wanderings in Paris of two Cana
i dians and two Americans, on
| in 19'IG.
Mr. Moffat has a light and un
i usually amusing style, more Eng
j lish in type than American. His
literal translation of French con
i versations should bring warmth to
i the hearts of those whose early
school days were darkened by hav
i ing to learn about "the cat of my
j aunt which is in the garden of the
house which is to my uncle."
