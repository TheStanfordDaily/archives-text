## HOLY CROSS ALUMNUS REGRETS GAME CHANGE 
### 
• The Editor, Sir:
As a Holy Cross alumnus, I am
i taking this opportunity to write to
you, in regard to the current Dart
mouth-Stanford game controversy.
I held no very exalted place during
! my time at Holy Cross, and I am not
' now able to speak from any posi
-1 tion of authority, but I am suffi
ciently near in time to undergradu
-1 ate days, to consider my viewpoint
as fairly representative.
• In view of the statement of our
j director of athletics, disclaiming re
i sponsibility for Mayor Curley's or
■ der, this may appear superfluous.
None the less, it is my desire to
convey to you an impression of the
feeling of The rank and file.
It is my opinion that the average
Holy Cross man views the entire
situation with a very real sense of

[ disappointment and dislike.
He regrets the awkward position j
in which the Boston College action [
has caused him to appear, as having j
to fear lest the contrast of another j
game make his own appear inconse- .
j quential and unimportant.
He regrets, in any case, that the i
j commercial aspect of the game !
should be so stressed.
He regrets most of all the injudi- j
cious use of political power, and the
( unsportsmanlike attitude of those 1
who caused the order.
Holy Cross and Holy Cross men j
have neither secured nor approved '
the present state of affairs, and it is 1
our hope that that fact will be un- 1
derstood clearly by the student body i
of Stanford.
Very truly yours,
Leonard M. Bertsch
