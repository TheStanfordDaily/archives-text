Get this one. Mr. C.E.W., '.'l2.
writes in the "Bronx Cheer,"
sports gossip column of the
"Daily Californian":
"Robert L. Tempieton writes
in a San Francisco daily: 'I have
always thought and am still of
the opinion that the timers at
Berkeley are just a little too
anxious about pushing the stem
on the stop watch when timing
Spencer Sparks and that times
recorded are a bit fast for the
Bear runner.'
"It seems a shame to question the
ord of "Doubting but we're
)t at all sure here at Berkeley that
pencer Sparks will be nosed out
/ Hector Dyer, Les Hables, Lom
irdi, et al. Dink need not worry
>out the watch Saturday. He may
• able to watch Spencer Sparks
•eak the tape ahead of those world
mating Cards.
"Christie's material when con
sidered alongside of that which
has filtered into the Card lair,
has been less than mediocre for
the past seven years. For proof
one can merely turn to the
freshman meets staged between
the Bears and Cards since 1923.
The California yearlings have
not defeated their rivals from
the Farm for seven years. Stan
ford's great young coach has
had to do the best he can with
some of the most versatile cin
der performers in the whole
country."

Well, fans, it's a pitiable state
hen a sports writer is driven to in
nity from trying to write about
hletic teams which have been tak
g it on the nose with monotonous
gularity for Ihe past year or so.
)t for a minute do we think that
r. C.E.W. was in his right mind
nen he wrote the above article in
s paper on the morning of Friday,
oril 17. It's almost impossible to
ko him seriously.
Maybe Dink was a little out
spoken in his distrust of Berke
ley timers, and then again, may
be he wasn't. As we remember
it Spencer Sparks came a long
way from stopping any watches
in the Stadium Saturday. In fact
it seems that he had a pretty
tough time taking a fourth in
the 220 behind the trio that Mr.
C.E.W. was kind enough to label
'world-beating." Ho wever,
Spencer was rewarded for his
day's work by the grand total of
ruie point in the century, when
Les Hables failed for the first
time this year to keep pace with
Dyer.
Yes, it is true that Mr. Tempieton
s been getting better material than
\ Christie, and it is not remark
le that both coaches are doing
> best they know how with what
■y have. That there is still some
pe for Mr. C.E.W. is evident in
> fact that he merely insinuated,
;tead of coming right out with it,
it Mr. Tempieton didn't know how
ite as well as Mr. Christie.
That hit about seven years of
Indian freshman track suprem
icy evidently settled the ques
ion in the mind of the "Bronx
Cheer" author. But let's do a
ittle comparing. In the past
luce years, for example, year
ings from the Farm have
lowncd the Cubs by scores of
iX-03, (ifi-(JS, and 78-s.'}. Scores
»f Cardinal varsity victories for
be same period have been 94 2-3
o 36 1 -:i, 83 to 4S, and 1012-3
o 29 1 -3.
Vlay we ask C.E.W. why such
irly-equal strength in the rival
shman teams of 1929 and 1930
jomes so lopsided when these
ne men are competing in the Big
et of 1931? Perhaps the colpl
rkeley fog has a bad effect upon
iwing athletes.
.
Jen Eastman is a good example of
,v Dink develops 'em. This blond i
ang sophomore came to Stanfoi'd
a 53.0 quarter-miler. Nov/ he runs
fiat. When asked to what he con
futed his sensational develop- i
nt, Ben replied: "Dink Temple
." Ben took 10 points in the Big
et besides running the last lap of i
relay.

Perhaps Harry Bell of Cali
ornia is an exception, but if
ou remember, he won the in
erscholastic state championship
undred-yard dash in some
hing like 10.1. He's now a
ophomore on Christie's squad,
ut wasn't even entered in last
.aturday's meet. In fact, Lucas,
irophy, and Vantrcss were the
nly Bear sophomores to get
ito the scoring column with a
ombincd total of less than two
oints! —Crawford
