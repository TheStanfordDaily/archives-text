By Richard Van W agenen

Stanford is lo be well represented
!at the Ojai intercollegiate tennis
' tournament over the week-end in
the persons of Keith Gledhill and
Captain Ted Easton. The two Indian
stars will leave for Ojai today noon
f in order to rea<?h there for the be
ginning of the tournament Thurs
day. Play will continue through
Saturday.
Gledhill's chances are excellent.
Having found no three-set competi
] tor so far this season—and he has
played three of the top coast net
i men—he is not likely to have a great
j deal of opposition for the Ojai title.
Lewis to Play
Elbert Lewis, present holder of
the Pacific Coast Conference singles
■ championship, will probably be on
: hand, and perhaps Jack DeLara,
Trojan first man, and Captain Allan
Blade of the Bears.
I Gledhill has vanquished both
Lewis and DeLara twice this season
!in straight sets, and Blade has
; fallen once before the powerful
; game of the local first man.
Easton Tough Opponent
Whereas Ted Easton is not ex
j pected to climb to the heights that
j his stellar teammate is almost cer
tain to reach, he will be no second
rater among the college net artists.
Backed up by considerable tour
nament experience, the local captain
will be a tough opponent for every-
I one he meets.
