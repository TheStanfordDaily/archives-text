# INDIAN SPRINTER HIT BY APPENDICITIS; CLUB RUNNER DEFEATS LOMBARDI, DYER
## 
### Fritz Goodwin 
With Les Hables in the hospital j
following an attack of appendicitis |
; Monday, and Dink Templeton in j
San Francisco, the Indian sprinters j
; went into a slump yesterday after
i noon to finish behind Cy Leland of
the Olympic Club and Montague of
! San Francisco University in a spe
! cial 100-yard heat.
Leland won the race in 9.9, his j
| best time this season, closely fol
! lowed by Montague, Lombardi, and
| Dyer, in that order. The former
Texas Christian football and track
j star got off to a good start and led
j the Stanford duo all the way. Dyer
; was particularly slow in getting out
j of his holes.
No Operation Necessary
While it is reported that Hables
I will not have to undergo an opera
-1 tion, it seems possible that Dink's
| versatile Les will be in tip-top shape
I lor the S.C. meet a week from Sat-

| urday.
| In the absence of Templeton, very
I little transpired under the hot sun
I in the Stadium yesterday. Coach
j Charley Hunter of the Winged "O"
trackmen was the most active in
j dividual present, watching carefully
i his star sprinter, Leland, and his
| former Stanford athletes, Dowell and
j Berry, who were working out in the
i broad jump and pole vault pits,
j Arnie West, intercollegiate broad
jump champion and Dink's chief
; hope to break into the high scoring
i in that event against the Trojans,
{ was still talking things easy. A1 Ray
I was out for practice again, after
! several days' absence resulting from
a strained shoulder muscle. Ray
was not throwing the javelin, con
fining himself to limbering exer
cises.
That troublesome appendix of Les

| Hables' may well be a source of no
j little concern to Farm fans who are
j anticipating a cinder victory over
Southern California. Since Satur
; day, when Frank Lombardi looked
like his old self in the sprinta Hables
may not seem so indispensable to
; some in the dash events, but he will
be needed for a winning relay te3m.
j Hables has been a potential 9.7
seconds man in the century all sea
son, and Templeton may find he
needs certain second- and thifd
place points against S.C., if Wykoff
has a good day. With the Trojan
relay team getting under 3:16, the
loss of Hables in this race may ac
! count for the narrow margin of de
feat or victory upon which pre-meet
[statisticians are figuring.

"Spud" Manning claimed a new
record at 15,265 feet for delayed par
achute jumps.
