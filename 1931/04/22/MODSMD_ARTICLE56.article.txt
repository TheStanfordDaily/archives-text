# Cards Confident Of Victory Over S.F.U.
## Indian Nine Given Chance To Win Conference Title This Season 
### Francis Lloyd 
With the expectation of at least
tying for the league lead by defeat
ing San Francisco University today
whom they play at 3:15 o'clock on
I the local diamond, the Stanford nine
finished off practice yesterday with
] pennant hopes in their minds.
First call will be given to Vard
Loomis to take the mound against
the Gray Fog outfit. Catching duties
will be taken care of by Art Miller,
| who has been hitting in fine style in
; his last three starts.
S.F.U. Is Weak Team
Little opposition should be given
; by Gene Valla's S.F.U. nine in to-
I day's game. However, the city team
j succeeded in trouncing the once
j dangerous Gaels last week by a
J large margin and may prove to be the
j worm who was reported to have
J changed its front.
Indications today rather show that
! Burt Delmas will be out for the re
mainder of the season, the infection
! in his hand not having improved to
I any extent. Max Cutshaw will be
j called upon to fill in the shortstop
, position.
Chance For Heavy Hitters
1 The Cards' heavy hitters intend
!to fatten their batting averages off
the deliveries of the Gray Fog
pitchers, who have not shown very
| much "stuff" at any time this sea
son. It is conceivable that Rudy Rin
tala might be able to get his aver
! age near the .500 per cent mark for
| the year by keeping up the pace
he set during the California series.
Saturday's game, which was ori
: ginally planned for Recreation Park
in San Francisco, will be played on
i the local diamond instead, due to
the poor condition of the city field.
Although a fairly small factor, this
j shift should favor the Indians'
chances in their pennant race.
