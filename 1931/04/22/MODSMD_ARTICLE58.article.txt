# SOLONS CONSIDER NEW APPEALS ON STATE TREASURY
## Clogged Files Hinder Work Of State Legislature On Finance Bills 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Apr. 21. (/P).â€”
With the budget controversy out of
the way the legislature today settled
down to the routine business of clear
ing clogged files and considering
many special appropriation bills
seeking sums of money not included
in the state government's financial
setup.
The Senate Finance Committee
started the day with consideration of
some of these appropriation bills.
How many shall get through is un
certain but it is estimated the total
from both houses will not exceed
$4,000,000.
This is not a large amount when it
is considered the total sought by the
appropriation bills is in excess of
$40,000,000 but every dollar thus ap
proved must be provided from the
general, emergency, or some other
fund.
The budget fared well at the hands
of the legislature. The Senate Fi
nance Committee abandoned its stand
for reductions totaling $951,024 and
the total cuts amounted to but $159,-
400 of the $265,345,955.38 originally
asked by the administration.
As a matter of record the budget
as approved by the legislature totals
$265,841,591.38 or $505,636 more than
in the original drafts submitted by
Director of Finance Roland Vande
grift. This was because of additions
made when the budget v/as before
the Assembly. The budget is ex
pected to be given clear sailing from
now on.
