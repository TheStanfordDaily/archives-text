# FROSH NETMEN PLAY BERKELEY HIGH HERE
## 
### 
Meeting the Berkeley High tennis
squad here at 10 o'clock Saturday
morning, the freshman netsters will
have another chance to display their
mettle. They are expecting to meet
some competition, but none too dan
gerous to threaten their winning by
a considerable margin.

Captain Chuck Otis will lead the
babes into battle, followed by Monle
Shwayder, Dan Ellis, AI Bogan, Kel
ley Thorpe, and Alden Sadler for
the singles. Otis and Ellis, Johnson
and Kneisley, and Bogan and
Shwayder will handle the doubles
against the invaders.
