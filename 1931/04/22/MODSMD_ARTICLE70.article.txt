# STUDIOUS WOMEN NO BEAUTIES SAYS OXFORD GRADUATE
## Famed English University Teaches Bridge, Golf, Extravagance 
### 
The discovery that girls keen on
educating their brains neither know
nor care about making themselves
or their clothes attractive is one of
those listed in the London "Daily
Mail" by Charles Graves, novelist,
that he made while at Oxford Uni
versity.
Graves said that Oxford also
taught him to stay up late, to be
extravagant, to work in spasms, to
dress more tidily, to waste an enor
mous amount of time, and to ima
gine that any job of less than $2,000
would be an insult.
Bridge, golf, and cricket were also
mentioned as acquisitions gained at
the university, and (although
promptly forgotten) he learned
"enough Gothic and Anglo-Saxon
to satisfy the late Sir Walter
Raleigh."
Unless he has a definite prospect
of a position at his graduation,
Graves does not advise a young man
to attend a university. The three
or four-year handicap in starting
business makes competiton hard, he
said.
"Polish, a lot of acquaintances,
and about three real friends are the
values to be gained at the English
university," Graves claimed.
