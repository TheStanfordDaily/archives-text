# PLANS FOR BAY CITIES' BRIDGE TO BE DRAFTED
## Legal Obstacles Removed To Build Toll Bridge For S.F., Oakland TO COST $75,000,000 Suit Over Bay Span Begun By City Auditor 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 22. (TP)
■—All legal obstacles were removed
today to construction of a $75,000,000
toll bridge across San Francisco Bay
between this city and Oakland by
a State Supreme Court decision
which held legal the creation by the
legislature of the California toll
bridge authority to draft plans for
the bridge.
The decision was based on a
friendly suit brought by Benning
Wentworth, city auditor of San
Francisco, who attacked the toll
oridge act by withholding approval
jf a $5,000 appropriation voted by
he San Francisco board of super
visors to aid in a preliminary sur
vey of the bridge site.
Wentworth withheld appro
priation on the ground it was an il
egal use of public funds because it
•vas to aid in defraying expenses
eading up to an issue of so-called
evenue bonds. His objection rested
nainly upon the finding of the San
? rancisco department of public
vorks in its report to the toll bridge
iuthority that the cost of the bridge
yill be in the neighborhood of
!75,000,000. He regarded this as a
violation of Article XVII of the
State Constitution which provides
he legislature shall contract no
jublic debts in excess of $300,000
mless warranted by a public emer
gency.
The Supreme Court pointed out
hat the bridge bonds were secured
iy revenue on the property and
•onstituted no liability upon the
jeojple.
