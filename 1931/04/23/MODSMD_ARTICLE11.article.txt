# VALLEY WATER PLAN REMAINS UNSETTLED
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, April 22 (/P). â€”
The fight between the two great val
leys of California, Sacramento and
San Joaquin, over the proposed co
ordinated water plan was unsettled
today. In fact, the original draft
drawn by the legislative water com
mittee bore 67 amendments as proof
of varying opinions and hours of
controversy. i
The Senate Constitutional Amend- i
ment Committee met again last night j
to hear suggestions from the valley
and delta regions of the state rela
tive to the $188,000,000 plan for i
transferring surplus waters from the
Sacramento river to arid portions of 1
the San Joaquin valley counties.
