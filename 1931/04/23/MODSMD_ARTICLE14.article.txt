WASHINGTON, April 22. (A') â€”
A scientist's defense of the use of
1 animals for vivisection to seek
remedies for disease was presented
to the annual congress of the
Daughters of the American Revolu
j tion today by Surgeon General
Hugh S. Cumming.
"There has been a good deal of
; talk among many misguided peopie
who are trying to get through Con
gress a law against the use of ani-
I mals in scientific research," Cum
j ming said.
"In the face of human sacrifices,"
| he continued, "we feel very deeply
j on the subject. We see no reason
i why people should object to the use
jof rabbits, white mice, and even
; dogs."

Mayor E. E. Roberts, of Reno,
Nev., believes that the only way to
j drive bootleggers out of business is
j "to place a barrel of whiskey on
j every corner and let everyone help
! himself."
