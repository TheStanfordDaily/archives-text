# Russians Paid Salaries For Attending College
## 
### RALPH MALLOCH 
Take this from an ex-rough and
i one of the former 500, who ought to
I know: Russia is the ideal place to
' go to college.
For in the Russian scheme of
things, college education is not only
' free, but students are paid a salary
in addition, according to Violet Bal
comb Orr, who with her husband
has spent several years in the Soviet
Republic. The Orrs, both members
of the Class of '25, are spending a
few days in Palo Alto before de
parting again for the distant steppes.
Such glorified collegiate subsidy is
carried on in a large way by the
| government which considers an cdu
! cated person a valuable asset to the
state, Mrs. Orr avers. Adding touch
es to the picture of an Utopian Rus
sia, the Stanford travellers say that
compulsory insurance by the gov
ernment has worked tremendously
toward clearing up hunger, unem-
I ployinent, and the exigencies of old
I age among the people.

( "To each according to his need,
and from each according to his abil
ity is the Communist goal," declared
Mrs. Orr. "They do not, however,
claim to have established Commun
; ism now, but only a limited form of
! state socialism, together with gov
j ernment ownership of business."
A startling economic equality ex
| ists between the sexes, as the Orrs
1 have observed it. "Today in Russia
no man rises that a woman may sit.
j The two are on equal business foot
| ing. Women conductors, engineers,
army commanders, and political
! leaders prove all vocations open.
(Under this rapid change from feu
(dalism to a modern industrial na
tion, the entire country is serious
' and at work.
"World revolution is not the aim
of the Soviets,' say these Stanford
grads who are going back to watch
the Soviet wheels Ro round. "If Rus
i sia can be made .to function smooth
ly, Communism will spak for itself."
