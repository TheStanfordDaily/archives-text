# CHANCELLOR'S HEALTH SHOWS GRADUAL WANE
## Dr. Jordan Loses Strength From Circulatory Affliction 
### 
Recent serious condition of Dr.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
Chancellor Emeritus .remained prac
tically unchanged last night, accord
ing to the report of Dr. Russell V.
Lee, attending physician.
Dr. Lee stated that the venerable
educator was possibly a little weak
er and that a gradual decline in
strength rather than a sudden re
lapse might be expected. Dr. Jor
dan is suffering from a circulatory
malady, due to advancing years, the
doctor said.
The Chancellor Emeritus has been
confined to a wheelchair at his home
for the past two years except for a
short visit he made to inspect his
old office on the Quad, which is be
ing remodeled into a seminar room
as a memorial to the aged scholar.
Dr. Jordan made the visit to Jordan
Hall about a month ago, but it was
not until about three weeks ago that
his present illness set in.
Besides serving as president of the
University for the first 22 years of
its existence, Dr. Jordan has been
an active advocate of world peace,
winning the Raphael Herman award
of $25,000 in 1924 for an essay' on
peace. Study of fish life absorbed a
great deal of the attention of the
aged chancellor, and innumerable
pamphlets, monographs and * books
have been written by him in this
field.
Until the onset of his illness, Dr.
Jordan was quite active in Univer
sity affairs, many members of the
senior and junior classes having had
the pleasure of attending the Thurs
day evening informal discussions
held at his home.
