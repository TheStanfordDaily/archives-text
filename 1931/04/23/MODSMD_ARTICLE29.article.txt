# INDIAN VARSITY DEFEATS S.F.U. BALL NINE, 4-2
## Victory Assures Cardinals Of Tie At Least For Conference Title LOOMIS FANS TEN MEN Gaddy Gets Triple; Cards Make Two Double Plays 
### Francis Lloyd 
With the wind sweeping over the
diamond and the sun completely
hidden by forbidding looking clouds,
Vard Loomis pitched the Indians to
a 4-2 victory over the San Francisco
University nine yesterday, thereby
assuring the Cards of at least a tie
for the league pennant.
After the first two innings when
the Redshirts shoved over three
runs, the game developed into a
well-played pitchers' duel between
! Loomis and O'Day. The Stanford
chucker was credited with 10 strike
outs and allowed 7 hits.
Two Runs in First
After Dykes Johnson had reached
the bases on a clean hit in the first
inning, Hardy sacrificed him to sec
ond, and was brought in by Hun
ken's Texas leaguer over short.
Philippi, who had gotten on base
i by an infield hit, came in on Cut
shaw's infield out.
With two out in the second in
| ning, Loomis helped win his own
game by doubling to right and com
ing in a moment later when the
Gray Fog right fielder dropped
Dykes Johnson's high fly. All doubt
of the final outcome was removed
in the eighth when Hardy scored on
i Cutshaw's sacrifice fly.
Three Umpires Used
j After patiently waiting for the
past two games for the umpires to
! make their appearance the fans were
treated yesterday to the "big time"
spectacle of having three umpires
i scouting about the field. Even with
all this officiating Gene Valla's men
seemed to object to the ruling on
j Stanford's second double play of the
day.
Gathering in a high foul fly, Spud
Hardy made a quick throw to Cut
i shaw at second who whirled around
ito get "Tiger" Gaddy, who was
ambling back to the bag in the
J eighth inning. Harry Wolter's men
S got their other double play in the
j sixth frame with a play from Loomis
to Philippi to Hardy.
The Cards have but one game re
maining on their schedule which
will be played on the local diamond
