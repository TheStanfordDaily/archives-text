The income from will he given annually lo the
senior student at Barnard College who "has given conspicu
ous evidence of unselfishness during her college course."
The donation comes from an alumna of the class of MM.
Rewards are common in modern collegiate education, re
wards of every description: prizes for high scholarship,
awards for all-round ability, honors for excellence in ath
letic performance, medals for debaters, awards in essay
contests, and the like. And, as Professor lienry Morton
Robinson observed in a recent magazine article, colleges are
now tending lo reward poverty, by giving scholarships on
a basis in which need is the greatest factor, and in which
individual potentiality plays a small part.
It is interesting, then, to lind this unique recognition of
unselfishness in college. The modern tendency is toward
the encouragement of selfishness. The race is a fast one,
and each strives for himself alone. In the hurry of modern
life, in college years as well in the years beyond, little un
selfish attention is paid to others. This grasping, self-seek
ing tendency is one of the criticisms of present-day society.
Apparently the donor of the $3,000 feels this, and as she
looks at the modern Barnard student and compares her
with the Barnard women she knew in her class, in 1894, she
appreciates the need for the encouragement of unselfish
ness. And what she is attempting to do at the Manhattan
college might well be attempted where the rolling foothills
rise.
