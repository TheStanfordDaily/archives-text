# THE 						POSSIBILITY OF FREEDOM
## 
### 
II has been argued that the spirit of a university must be
I lie spirit of freedom if thought is to be stimulated to its
fullest development. The question at once arises: Is free
dom possible? If students are simply turned loose to follow
their own inclinations and interests, arc they not liable to
make irreparable mistakes which they would have escaped
had they been required to follow certain courses? Thus we
are faced wit li a fundamental dilemma: on the one hand,
compulsion smothers thought; on the other, compulsion
sv 'ins necessary to make certain that students will know
that which is essential to a rounded mental development.
How can freedom and necessary authority be reconciled?
I he answer lies in the use of a hypothetical imperative.
Let the I Diversity say to the student: You wish to enter this
institution, which implies that you wish to pursue a course
of study in some field of knowledge. You are given the
liberty of choosing the Held in which you wish to work. You
choose sucli and such a field. Very well. Now, within this
field, there are certain things which a well-educated man
ought to know. Accordingly, the University must set certain
standards, and to those who reach these standards, it will
grant degrees. If, therefore, you wish to receive a degree,
it will be necessary for you to prepaiY yourself to meet these
standards. The responsibility for preparing yourself is
yours, and you may go about the task in vour own way and
at your own pace. The library and lcciures of the Univer
sity are at your disposal; you may attend lectures or not, as
you think best. The advice and guidance of the faculty are
also open to you. These things the University provides for
your use, but it does not compel you to use them. Its only
requirement is that before you receive your degree, you
must show that you have attained the standards the Uni
versity has set. The responsibility is your own.
In this way, by Setting certain standards that are in
trinsically reasonable and desirable while leaving the re
sponsibility and effort for attaining these standards to the
individual student himself, Ihe dilemma is solved and free
dom is possible under authority. The Minnesota Path/.
