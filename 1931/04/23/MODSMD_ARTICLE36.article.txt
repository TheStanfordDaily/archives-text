THE EVERLASTING STRUGGLE.
By Johan Bojer. Translated from
Norwegian by Heni and Rourke.
New York: Century. 19.' U. (At the
Palo Alto Boole Store.)
The hardships and misfortunes of
I the simple folk of a Norwegian fish
| ing village are vividly portrayed in
: this story, which, like most of Bo
; jer's novels, has_ no particular plot.
Mother Lisbet, a plain, unassum
ing Nordic countrywoman, centralizes
! the various branches of the story, as
the lives of each of her children are
| developed in turn.
The book is well-written, but the
pessimistic trend does not make for
entertainment. Existence for the
characters seems to be a continual
weary cycle of futile efforts toward
intangible and vapid desires. The
descriptions of the locality and the
people are poignant and realistic.

DISHONORED—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
The great Dietrich again! This
i time in a concoction of Austria, Rus
i sia, world wars, spies, and handsome
! Cossack officers. Dietrich is the al
luring spy who finally gets her Cos
. sack, only to let him go.
This may sound like .a panning
[ but it is not meant as one. The
much-discussed German "find" real
ly deserves most of her publicity;
j she can act, and without a doubt her
j legs are very superior.
Victor McLaglen is the Russian
hero. He tries hard, but seems more

successful as a doughboy in gay
"Paree." The spy theme which runs
through "Dishonored" is not exactly
original, but has suspense and ex
citement.

SKIPPY—At the Varsity Theatre.
If you enjoy the "Skippy" strip
in the Examiner and tend toward
high blood pressure stay away from
the Varsity this week.
With typical Hollywood liberty,
Paramount has taken the invariably
amusing and human characters of
Crosby's comic strip and changed
them until they ,are unrecognizable.
The film drags hopelessly and
boringly along for the first three
quarters of an hour and th»n breaks
into heart-rending tragedy which is
only relieved by the complete suc
cess of the virtuous and the down
fall of all the unrighteous.
The acting was almost consistently
good compared with the usual run
of the performance of child mar
vels. Bobbie Coogan is a worthy and
much more convincing successor to
the fast-disappearing Jackie.
The coterie of Mitzi Green haters
should see this picture if only to
feed their hates —it should make
them unquenchable. She is a good
little actress and in the part of the
despicable Eloise she shows it ably.
It is often wise to wait until the
main feature begins but it would be
best (unless you are 12 years old
or younger) to come early, sit
through an excellent sound cartoon
fielm and a Charley Chase comedy,
and then leave S.C.A.
