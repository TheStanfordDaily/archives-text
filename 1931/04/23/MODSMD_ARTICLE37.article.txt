# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
Action! We've been screaming
I about not having any for months,
J and here it is right under our noses!
i The most stupendous thing in the
| history of the nation, folks! Some
; thing to make you thrill and shiver
! with delighted astonishment. That
good old roommate of ours got up
at seven sharp, this morning, with- j
i out an alarm. And she said she was i
] immune to blond men.
Now that we've come out j
ahead of California in something
else, being the JofYre Medal de- j
bate, there's nothing left for
them to do but to come to terms j
and let us buy them out. Of
course, they're worrying about
finals right now. so we're at an i
advantage—but stilt, it's worth j
that wins. We're told that Mr.
Shibley practiced speaking to
the desert sand-storms, and
| Miss Morriss trained her voice
answering telephones for a
j crowded house. Purely sugges
tion, of course.

And there's going to be concert !
series next year, with even more and j
better people to do entertaining j
things. Maybe a lot more of you will
turn out for them, too, if they put a
decent heating system in the Pavil
ion, as planned. All of it is a couple
of steps forward. Everything comes
to the man who waits, if he waits
long enough and Death doesn't beat |

him to it.
Meanwhile, the 500 and their
superiors go dashing wildly
about getting ready to show the
world how and why, on Satur
day night at the Gym Dance,
with a lot fewer sunburned
noses, we hope, than they ac
quired last Saturday, selling
things.
It'll be so, so funny, don't you
know, my dear, for the sweet things
to go tripping up faternity steps and
into Toyon, etc., asking for their
dates to the dance. Progressive wo
manhood! Hope they don't strike
Encina in one of its throwing
sprinkling moods.
And you never can tell what'll
happen to an old shoe or a last
year's hat, or can you? There's
Woodpecker Hall, the ex-gymna
sium, being used as Glee Club train
ing quarters. And the office of the
Women's Medical Advisor has
turned into a print shop, putting
together a newspaper of its own
three days a week. What a come
down, Thomasina.
Color-blind students will have to
start listening again. At last! Stop
lights to be had at the Palm Drive-
Highway crossing. Even the gates
are bearable, if you don't have to
worry about being thrown against
them by a speeding non-stop auto
mobilist, some day. Hallelujah! Ac
tion!

advantage—but stilt, it's worth j
that wins. We're told that Mr.
Shibley practiced speaking to
the desert sand-storms, and
| Miss Morriss trained her voice
answering telephones for a
j crowded house. Purely sugges
tion, of course.

And there's going to be concert !
series next year, with even more and j
better people to do entertaining j
things. Maybe a lot more of you will
turn out for them, too, if they put a
decent heating system in the Pavil
ion, as planned. All of it is a couple
of steps forward. Everything comes
to the man who waits, if he waits
long enough and Death doesn't beat |

him to it.
Meanwhile, the 500 and their
superiors go dashing wildly
about getting ready to show the
world how and why, on Satur
day night at the Gym Dance,
with a lot fewer sunburned
noses, we hope, than they ac
quired last Saturday, selling
things.
It'll be so, so funny, don't you
know, my dear, for the sweet things
to go tripping up faternity steps and
into Toyon, etc., asking for their
dates to the dance. Progressive wo
manhood! Hope they don't strike
Encina in one of its throwing
sprinkling moods.
And you never can tell what'll
happen to an old shoe or a last
year's hat, or can you? There's
Woodpecker Hall, the ex-gymna
sium, being used as Glee Club train
ing quarters. And the office of the
Women's Medical Advisor has
turned into a print shop, putting
together a newspaper of its own
three days a week. What a come
down, Thomasina.
Color-blind students will have to
start listening again. At last! Stop
lights to be had at the Palm Drive-
Highway crossing. Even the gates
are bearable, if you don't have to
worry about being thrown against
them by a speeding non-stop auto
mobilist, some day. Hallelujah! Ac
tion!
Action! We've been screaming
I about not having any for months,
J and here it is right under our noses!
i The most stupendous thing in the
| history of the nation, folks! Some
; thing to make you thrill and shiver
! with delighted astonishment. That
good old roommate of ours got up
at seven sharp, this morning, with- j
i out an alarm. And she said she was i
] immune to blond men.
Now that we've come out j
ahead of California in something
else, being the JofYre Medal de- j
bate, there's nothing left for
them to do but to come to terms j
and let us buy them out. Of
course, they're worrying about
finals right now. so we're at an i
advantage—but stilt, it's worth j
