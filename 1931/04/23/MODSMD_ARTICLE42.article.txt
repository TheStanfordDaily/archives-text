## BOSTON MERELY DID HIS "DUTY" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The letter from the Holy Cross
alumnus in yesterday's column was
interesting and the editorial com
ment on it quite justified except for
one or two errors of fact.
When the Dartmouth-Stanford
game was scheduled, Harvard of
fered the use of its stadium for the
contest. This was accepted by Dart
mouth and the matter considered
settled. Now Holy Cross and Boston
College never have had the use of
the stadium and never will. Dart
mouth is the only institution to

I whom Harvard has granted such
I permission. The Holy Cross and
j Boston College game is always
J played in a baseball park in Boston.
! Friends of Boston College, in seek
i ing a way to the conflict dis
| covered an old contract between
I Harvard and the City of Boston,
whereby the Mayor's permission is
necessary for any contest in the
stadium in which Harvard did not
participate. The Mayor, a friend of
Boston College, merely did his
j "duty."
