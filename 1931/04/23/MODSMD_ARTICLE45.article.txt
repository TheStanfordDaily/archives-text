# GLEDHILL, EASTON LEAVE TO PLAY IN OJAI TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Captain Ted Easton and Keilh
Gledhill, two of Stanford's tennis ex
perts, left yesterday for Ojai, where
they will take part in the annual
intercollegiate tournament. Play be
gins today and ends Saturday after
noon.
Both of these stars are sure to
make their presence felt at the ex
pense of some of the best players
on the coast, and Gledhill is favored
to win the tournament champion
ship. Elbert Lewis, Jack DeLara,
and Allan Blade may be on hand,
and, if so, will provide the main
competition for the local boys. As
Gledhill has beaten all three in
straight sets so far this season, they
should not bother him greatly.
