## PICK THE WINNER!

Doping track meets is one of
the greatest indoor pastimes in
ihe world today. If you don't
believe it provides laughter and
amusement take lirifk Morse as
an example. He's had plenty of
fun at it for the past several
years, especially around Big
Meet time. Missing the result by
40 points or so seldom makes
any difference, another point
which Mr. Morse will verify.
But now comes the big chance for
fill the experts we've encountered
around here lately, from the street
sweeper on up.. Ask anybody 011 the
campus who will win the Trojan-
Indian track meet on May 2 next,
and he'll tell you, and then proceed
to explain why. If you've read the
story on the front page of this
morning s issue, you already know
that the Daily is conducting a dope
contest, with prizes totalling $18 lor
ihe first three place-winners!
I'helps-Terkel is offering the
first prize, a ten-dollar pair of
shoes; Koos Bros, has put up-a
five-dollar sweater as a re
ward for the second best guess;
and a box of "Sticky" Wilson's
candy goes to third-place win
ner. That's quite an enticing set
up. mates, and it causes us grief
to know that members of the
Daily staff are not eligible to
compete.

Another precaution taken to keep
this contest on the up-and-up, was
to exclude managers and members
of the track team. It might' not look
quite right to the conscientious ama
teur to see Coach Robert Lyman
Templeton, lor example, copping the
prize money! And it's easy to see
why the dopers must figure how
each point-winner will place in each
event, Several of the scores turned
in are likely to be duplicates, but
there is small chance that two prize
seekers will arrive at the same con
clusion in exactly the same manner.
If it were not for the ever-doubt
ful attitude of humans as to the
fairness of a contest in which some
thing is offered for practically noth
ing, there would be no reason in the
world for keeping Dink out of it. J
For that matter, Cromwell could j
throw in his guess too. It's a cinch i
that these two great coaches would J
arrive at different conclusions while J
some chemical engineering major I
was grabbing the money.
Since this column is handling
the contest, it will keep its 1
anxious patrons informed on the !
progress of doping. Don't forget j
that the deadline is Thursday
noon, a week from today. The i
following Monday morning you

this contest on the up-and-up, was
to exclude managers and members
of the track team. It might' not look
quite right to the conscientious ama
teur to see Coach Robert Lyman
Templeton, lor example, copping the
prize money! And it's easy to see
why the dopers must figure how
each point-winner will place in each
event, Several of the scores turned
in are likely to be duplicates, but
there is small chance that two prize
seekers will arrive at the same con
clusion in exactly the same manner.
If it were not for the ever-doubt
ful attitude of humans as to the
fairness of a contest in which some
thing is offered for practically noth
ing, there would be no reason in the
world for keeping Dink out of it. J
For that matter, Cromwell could j
throw in his guess too. It's a cinch i
that these two great coaches would J
arrive at different conclusions while J
some chemical engineering major I
was grabbing the money.
Since this column is handling
the contest, it will keep its 1
anxious patrons informed on the !
progress of doping. Don't forget j
that the deadline is Thursday

Doping track meets is one of
the greatest indoor pastimes in
ihe world today. If you don't
believe it provides laughter and
amusement take lirifk Morse as
an example. He's had plenty of
fun at it for the past several
years, especially around Big
Meet time. Missing the result by
40 points or so seldom makes
any difference, another point
which Mr. Morse will verify.
But now comes the big chance for
fill the experts we've encountered
around here lately, from the street
sweeper on up.. Ask anybody 011 the
campus who will win the Trojan-
Indian track meet on May 2 next,
and he'll tell you, and then proceed
to explain why. If you've read the
story on the front page of this
morning s issue, you already know
that the Daily is conducting a dope
contest, with prizes totalling $18 lor
ihe first three place-winners!
I'helps-Terkel is offering the
first prize, a ten-dollar pair of
shoes; Koos Bros, has put up-a
five-dollar sweater as a re
ward for the second best guess;
and a box of "Sticky" Wilson's
candy goes to third-place win
ner. That's quite an enticing set
up. mates, and it causes us grief
to know that members of the
Daily staff are not eligible to
compete.
