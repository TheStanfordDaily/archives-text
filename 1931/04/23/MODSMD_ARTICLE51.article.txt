# FROSH TENNIS MEN TO MEET BERKELEY SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Captain Chuck Otis of the fresh- j
man tennis squad will lead his year
lings against Berkeley High Satur- <
day morning on the varsity courts.
Highly successful so far this season, i
the Babes have no intention of drop- !
ping a meet this late in the year.
San Francisco University fell be
fore their flashy racquets in Feb- !
ruarv, Piedmont High early in I
March, and the California freshmen â– 
April 11. S.F.U. lost by a decisive j
8-1 score, and the Piedmont netsters I
by an almost equally one-sided '
count. The Bears provided far more '
competition, barely being nosed out !
5-4.
Competing in their usual order, j
Monte Shwayder, Dan Ellis, A1 Bo
gan, Kelley Thorpe, and Alden Sad- 1
ler will probably take care of the !
singles, with Otis and Ellis, John- i
son and Kneisley, and Bogan and j
Shwayder handling the doubles.
