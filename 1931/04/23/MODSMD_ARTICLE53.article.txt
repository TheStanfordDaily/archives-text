# Lards race Bears Again in Pacific Track Meet
## BIG AGGREGATION OF STARS CLASH IN SATURDAY TILT Novelty Numbers Include Football Relay And Steeplechase 
### Lowell Cox 
Stanford and California track
j teams will meet Saturday for the
second time this season.
With the announcement from
Berkeley that ,a complete Golden
Bear squad will be entered in the
Pacific Amateur Association meet,
the largest collection of track stars
to assemble in San Francisco since
the World Fair games of 1915 will
j compete in Kezar Stadium Saturday.
More than 150 athletes have al
ready been entered, and the list may
be swelled further before the end of
the week. Besides Stanford, Cali
fornia, San Francisco U. and Olym
pic Club tams, many unattached
athletes will compete.
Duels Repeated
Of particular intei'est will be a
repetition of the Pool-De Gi'oct duel
in the pole vault.
The sprints promise to be espe
cially interesting with a number of
the leading stars of the West en
tered, including Dyer and Lombardi
of Stanford, Ward and Montague of
S.F.U., Grannucci and Lpland of the
Olympic Club and Spencer Sparks
of California.
Two novelty events are included
in the program, a football relay and
a steeplechase. Stanford will be rep
resented in the former by Harry j
I Hillman, Don Colvin, Phil Moffatt 1
and Charley Ehrhorn. The steeple- !
chase will be a two-mile affair, with
runners leaping over five hurdles j
and a water jump each lap.
As for team honors, Stanford and j
the Olympic Club are expected to 1
put up a close race, with a number !
of non-collegiate events giving the !
club at least an even break with ;
Dink Templeton's crew.
Informal Practice
With a cold, sharp wind howling j
in the Stadium, no startling per- j
formances were made in practice j
here yesterday. One time trial was
run, Ben Eastman beating Hec Dyer
by a couple of yards in a 352-yard ;
sprint in 38.3 seconds. Even better i
time would probably have been reg- i
istered had the Indian stars not had J
to run against the wind for much of j
the distance.
Templeton spent considerable time '
drilling Dyer on starts, Hec having i
been left in his holes in the century j
last week.
Les Hables appeared on the scene, j
having narrowly escaped an appen- I
dicitis operation, but was not in uni- 1
form. Whether he will be able to |
run against Southern California on I
May 2 is still a question. Even if he I
is able to compete, his illness is cer- !
tain to be a big handicap to him.

tered, including Dyer and Lombardi
of Stanford, Ward and Montague of
S.F.U., Grannucci and Lpland of the
Olympic Club and Spencer Sparks
of California.
Two novelty events are included
in the program, a football relay and
a steeplechase. Stanford will be rep
resented in the former by Harry j
I Hillman, Don Colvin, Phil Moffatt 1
and Charley Ehrhorn. The steeple- !
chase will be a two-mile affair, with
runners leaping over five hurdles j
and a water jump each lap.
As for team honors, Stanford and j
the Olympic Club are expected to 1
put up a close race, with a number !
of non-collegiate events giving the !
club at least an even break with ;
Dink Templeton's crew.
Informal Practice
With a cold, sharp wind howling j
in the Stadium, no startling per- j
formances were made in practice j
here yesterday. One time trial was
run, Ben Eastman beating Hec Dyer
by a couple of yards in a 352-yard ;
sprint in 38.3 seconds. Even better i
time would probably have been reg- i
istered had the Indian stars not had J
to run against the wind for much of j
the distance.
Templeton spent considerable time '
drilling Dyer on starts, Hec having i
been left in his holes in the century j
last week.
Les Hables appeared on the scene, j
having narrowly escaped an appen- I
dicitis operation, but was not in uni- 1
form. Whether he will be able to |
run against Southern California on I
May 2 is still a question. Even if he I
is able to compete, his illness is cer- !
tain to be a big handicap to him.
Stanford and California track
j teams will meet Saturday for the
second time this season.
With the announcement from
Berkeley that ,a complete Golden
Bear squad will be entered in the
Pacific Amateur Association meet,
the largest collection of track stars
to assemble in San Francisco since
the World Fair games of 1915 will
j compete in Kezar Stadium Saturday.
More than 150 athletes have al
ready been entered, and the list may
be swelled further before the end of
the week. Besides Stanford, Cali
fornia, San Francisco U. and Olym
pic Club tams, many unattached
athletes will compete.
Duels Repeated
Of particular intei'est will be a
repetition of the Pool-De Gi'oct duel
in the pole vault.
The sprints promise to be espe
cially interesting with a number of
the leading stars of the West en
tered, including Dyer and Lombardi
of Stanford, Ward and Montague of
S.F.U., Grannucci and Lpland of the
Olympic Club and Spencer Sparks
of California.
