HARTFORD, Conn., April 22. (/P)
â€”A bill offered in the general as
sembly to legalize in Connecticut
the sale and manufacture of four
per cent beer was rejected in the
house of representatives today.
A bulldog, imprisoned for ten
days in a cistern, seems none the
worse for the experience at Van
Buren, Ark.
