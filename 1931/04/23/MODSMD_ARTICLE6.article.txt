# PORTUGAL WILL QUELL UPRISING
## Rebel Gerrison At Funchal, Madeira, Assailed 
### 
LISBON, Portugal, April 22. (/P).â€”
The Lisbon government today an
nounced commencement of military
operations against the rebel garri
son at Funchal, Madeira.
A high official of the war depart
ment said that no alternative was
left after rejection by General Sousa
Dias, head of the revolutionary
Junta there, of an ultimatum de
manding cessation of the insurrec
tion.
The foreign office today published
a decree lifting the blockade about
the Azores, where a revolt similar
to that at Funchal was suppressed
without the firing of a shot.
There is considerable uneasiness
in Lisbon at reports of growing com
munistic agitation in Spain and of a
movement for establishment of an
Iberian federation, in which Portu
gal would be included. The idea
probably would find little liavor
here. Infiltration of communistic
ideas particularly is feared in the
Oporto region where there is con
siderable unemployment.
A Lisbon dispatch to Le Journal,
Paris, today quoted President Car
mona as stating that new Portuguese
elections would be held before the
end of the year with women having
family responsibilities participating.
