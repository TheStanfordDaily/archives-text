# LITTLE ADVANCES TO FINAL STAGES OF GOLF CONTEST
## Seaver-Hoerner Tilt Will Fill Last Bracket Of Quarter Finals 
### 
Lawson Little, recent winner of
Ihe Northern California tournament,
became the third freshman to win
his way into the quarter-finals of
the University championship when
he beat George Edmonds, 3 and 2,
yesterday on the Stanford course.
Only one quarter-final bracket
now remains unoccupied which will
jbe filled by the winner of the
! Charles Seaver-Jack Hoerner match.
' Since both are freshmen, the Class
of '34 is assured of four places in
the last eight.
Although Hoerner is rated as a
scratch player in Hastings, Nebras
ka, Seaver is considered a copper
riveted cinch to beat him, in which
1 case he must down Harry Eichel
i berger, third ranking varsity player,
to reach the semi-finals. This match
will undoubtedly be the feature of
third-round play.
Ever since his affiliation with the
S'anford golfing brigade Eichelber
ger has been known as a brilliant
i but erratic golfer. The first time he
ever played the Stanford course he
scored a 74 and his card included
eight birdies and four sixes.
During the last two weeks he has
been playing so consistently in the
low 70's that the adjective erratic no
longer applies. Last Tuesday he ret
up a new course record for the sec
ond nine with his 32. This astonish
ing total was compiled with the
help of four birdies.
All in all, Seaver, whom Bobbie
Jones thinks is a coming amateur
champion, faces a terrific struggle.
SAN FRANCISCO, April 22. (,P)
