# U.C. CO-EDS MOBBED WHILE ATTEMPTING "RASPBERRY" SCOOP
## 
### 
An attempt made by two Univer- i
sity of California co-eds, staff mem- |
bers of the Dill Pickle, a semes- j
terly "scandal sheet" published by
women, to "scoop" the contents of i
the rival men's publication, the
Raspberry Press last Tuesday eve
ning was summarily ended when i
they were pounced upon by a group
of men students.
The group included L. Stern Alt
shuler, student body president, and .
Arthur M. Arlett, former Daily Cali
fornian editor. They bound the i
women's hands and feet, painted I
their faces with red ink and spanked ;
them before sending them on their
way, it was revealed yesterday in,
the Raspberry's appearance.
The victims were Lois Swabel,
women's editor of the Daily Cali
fornian and member of Alpha Delta !
Pi, and Helen Moi'gan. assistant
women's editor and member of Phi
Mu.
University fraternities, charged '
with undermining athletics and stu
dent morale through excessive
drinking and gambling, were criti- '
cized by the Raspberry. Last Mon- j
day s "ballot stuffing" scandal came j
in for a severe drubbing.
