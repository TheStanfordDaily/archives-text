# BASEBALL NINE TAKES ON S.F.U. IN FINAL GAME
## Game Tomorrow Concludes Exceptional Season At Local Park JOHNSON WILL START Outlook Bright For Title Of Coast League 
### Francis Lloyd 
Climaxing a long, hard, and suc
cessful season, the Stanford baseball
team will play the San Francisco
University nine tomorrow at 2:30
o'clock in the local park with the
excellent prospect of finishing up
the afternoon as undisputed cham
pions of the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate League.
In order to make the champion
ship as certain as possible, Coach
Harry Wolter will start the Cards'
sensational pitcher, Dan Johnson, on
the mound.
S.F.U. Beaten in Both Games
The Gray Fog outfit has been de
feated by the Redshirts in their last
Iwo encounters by the scores of 10-G
and 4-2. However Gene Valla has
smoothed out a great many of the.
rough spots in his team, and in the
;ame last Wednesday the S.F.U. men
'ave the Indians an extremely close
oattle.
It is likely that Valla will start
O'Day on the mound again for the
fity team. O'Day was able to keep
he league leading Cards down to
seven hits and completely shut-out
iuch heavy hitters as Rintala and
Cutshaw, both of whom have had a
jreat deal of experience against dif
erent types of pitching.
Cutshaw Will Play Short
Shortshop will again be filled by
Viae Cutshaw, who showed to very
;ood advantage last Wednesday. His
4uick snap at second was the play
)f the day and cleared the atmos
jhere considerably for Vard Loomis.
In tlu Southland, St. Mary's
cnocked over the Bruins for the sec
>nd time in two days and will come
jp against the Trojans today and
omorrow. By defeating U.S.C. to
lay St. Mary's would cancel any
eeling of excitement from tomor
ow's game between the Cards and
S.F.U. as in that case the outcome
>f the game on the Farm would
lave no bearing on the champion -
;hip of the league.
Rintala Drops Batting Lead
After being shut out in three times
it bat yesterday, Rudy Rintala
Iropped his team batting leadership
o Bert Delmas, who was on the
>ench because of an infected hand.
)elmas finished up the year with a
>ercentage of .435, which may very
ikely secure him the individual bat
ing honors of the conference.
The only men to raise their av
rages in Wednesday's games were
-aptain Johnny Hunken, who got
ne out of three and Vince Philippi,
/ho smacked out two for four. How
ver, Rintala still has a chance to
egain the lead, if he should get
our for five or better.
