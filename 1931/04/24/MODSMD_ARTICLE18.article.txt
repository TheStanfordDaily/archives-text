# COMPLETION OF PLEDGING HEARS
## Cards Mailed Last Night; Lawyer Is Named 
### 
"It's all over now but the shoot
ing"â€”thus may be summed up men's
spring rushing. Final dates came to
a close at 10 o'clock last night, pref
erence night, and all that now re
mains is the booming of homemade
cannons on the Row, as pledges
walk from the lawyer's office to the
fraternities of their selection.
Cards were mailed late last night
by the Interfraternity Council to
freshmen for whom houses have
filed bids. They may be obtained by
the rushees this morning in their
post office boxes or at the general
delivery window.
Pledging will begin at 2 o'clock
ibis afternoon at the Old Union, be
fore Oscar F. Campbell, Palo Alto
bank executive and prominent citi
zen, who is acting in the capacity
of interfraternity lawyer.
Freshmen are requested by Rich
ard Grant, Interfraternity Council
president, to come to the office
promptly at the times indicated on
their cards, and not sooner.
Late bids may be filed with the
lawyer at 2 o'clock by the president
or representative of a fraternity,
Grant announces.
