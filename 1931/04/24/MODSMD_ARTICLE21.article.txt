LISBON, Portugal, April 23. (/P). â€”
Thirty thousand British rifles just
arrived were being served out to
night to Portuguese troops as the
government continued its drive
against the x - evolt in Madeira and
took precautions against the spread
of communism.
All leave for reserve officers not
yet called into active service has
been cancelled and President Car
mona's government apparently was
determined not to be caught nap
ping.
May Bombard Funchal
The Minister of Marine sailed for
Funchal today with (>OO troops to
put down the rebel Junta there,
without bloodshed if possible. He
is prepared to bombard the city if
necessary.
Tomorrow the liner Nyassa, fitted
with guns and ready to load three
seaplanes, will sail for Funchal with
troops, artillery, and provisions. The
whole expeditionary force is costing
the government about $50,000 a day.
Students Riot
There were student riots at Oporto
today and one young man was killed
when the police charged a mob
shouting threats to the government.
The Colonial office announced
that an insignificant revolt had bro
ken out in the garrison in Portu
guese Guinea (presumably Bolama)
but that it had been suppressed im
mediately by the governor, Major
Leite Majalhaes. Most of the troops
there were said to be loyal.
