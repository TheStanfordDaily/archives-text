# Railroads Fight State Order To Combine Depots
## High Court Hears Appeal From California Edict 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 23. —
Argument began today in the Su
preme Court on the plea of the Salt
Lake, Santa Fe, and Southern Pa
cific railroads that an order of the
California Railroad Commission re
quiring them to construct a $10,-
000,000 union passenger station in
L,os Angeles be set aside.
C. W. Durbrow for the railroads
outlined the litigation and will re
sume his attack tomorrow upon the
order and the decision of the Su
preme Court of California uphold
ing it.
Challenge State's Power
The railroads challenge the right
of the Commission to require them
to build union passenger stations,
taking the position that the Inter
state Commerce Commission alone
has jurisdiction in such matters.
The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion has authorized the railroads to
make changes necessary to reach a
union station with their lines but
refused to order them to build one.
Los Angeles Try Fails
An attempt by Los Angeles to
force the Commerce Commission to
order the roads to erect the station
failed in the Supreme Court.
The state courts then held the
California Commission had not been
divested of authority to make the
order and this has brought another
phase of the case to the Supreme
Court again.
