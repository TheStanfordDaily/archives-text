# RAILROAD FLARE STARTLES FROSH IN "FIRE" SCARE
## 
### 
J|i:SII)i;NTS of the cast wing
of Encina were startled one
night recently by the call of
"Fire" resounding through the
halls of the ancient brick head
quarters for freshmen. Con
vinced by the whining of inork
sirens and a realistic glow on
the second floor, more than one
embryonic rough sucked in a
deep breath of pure o/.onoe,
more than one pulse leaped to
the danger point.
Amid a clinging fog of pun
gent. acrid smoke the inmates
fled into the corridors with a
mutual thought "Where arc the
fire escapes?'"
But no. the professed hope of
immemorial numbers of first
year men was not to be ful
filled. The "fire" proved merely
the brilliant glare of a railroad
flare, imported by some ener
getic practical joker. A great
black scar in the flooring re
mains to augur that '34 will
suffer a distended breakage fee.
