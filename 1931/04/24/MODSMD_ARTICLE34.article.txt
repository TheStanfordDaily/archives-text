						OLD ARMY GAME

### 
The 1!M1 fraternity rushing. season is over. Nothing
more remains but the formal pledging today. Volume 7tt
of The Daily contains a few lines that were written at the
cud of women's rushing period in .January. They apply as
well to the men's rushing as they did to the women's and
so are printed here.
"Well, the hist gun has been fired. The treaty of peace
is signed.. The Five Hundred (today it's the Three Thou
sand) breathe it huge high of relief as the warfare of rush
ing is over.
"And as the big parade goes up the Row today there
will be victors and prisoners and dead and wounded scat
tered all over the feminine (today it's masculine) campus.
The battle of the (ireeks brought death and destruction for
some; for some, spoils and booty. Well, it's the old army
game, And it's much the better, like the World War, for
being in the past."
