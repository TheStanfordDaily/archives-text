# PANNING PAN-HELLENIC

### 
For a body that does little or nothing, Pan-Hcllcnic
seems to do it with more mystic hoorah and secrecy than
the Ancient Order of Left-Handed Arabian Fish-Peddlers.
Witness the veil of mystery that surrounds the election of
officers, held Inst Monday night, the results of which are
still a secret.
Every sorority on the campus cast its individual vote
last Monday for one of the three nominees submitted by
the nominating committee. Under the rules of Pan-Hel
lenic, the presidency goes to the nominee receiving the
highest number of votes, the vice-presidency and the sec
retaryship going to the second and third candidates, re
spectively.
Something more than 72 hours have elapsed since the
easting of votes, and all inquiries as to the result have
brought only the statement from President Jean I'll that
"there are complications." That and no more.
That complications can arise in elections, no one will
attempt to deny. That Pan Hellenic can surround its elec
tions with all the mumbo-jumbo and incantations of a
West Indian voodoo doctor, no one will deny, although the
sense of it may be questioned. But The Daily does ques
tion the right of Pan-Hellenic to refuse to divulge, as it has
refused to do, any information whatsoever regarding this
particular election. The members of that body deserve to
be told whether or not the election was valid, if not, why
it was not valid, and when the revote will be held. And
there is no good reason why that information should not
be made available within 21 hours after the votes had been
east.
