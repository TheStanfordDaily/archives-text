There is ;i quaint old American tradition that the col
lege student who makes his mark in scholarship never
amounts to much afterward; that the really admirable
product of our colleges is the glad-hander who is president
of things, plays tackle on the football team, and never lets
studies interfere with his college work; that for every rou
tine job awaiting the student "grind" there are 10 big
corporations clamoring for the services at a fancy salary
of the high hurdle champion who was president of his fra
ternity.
Kilter President Walter S. Clifford of the American Tele
phone and Telegraph Company with disillusionment. Clif
ford reports that men who graduate in the first tenth of
their class have four times as many chances of getting into
the higher-salaried groups as those who graduate in the
lowest third. Generally speaking, the men with the highest
scholastic records get the most responsible jobs and the
best salaries afterward. A number of large corporations
have standing offers open with various colleges to give
good jobs to the leading scholars in every class.
And don't think the college students haven't waked up
to that fact, long ahead of the public in general. At Am
herst recently 80 per cent of the senior class indicated that
they prized Phi Reta Kapna ahead of any other college dis
tinction. Yah 4 students have often indicated a similar pref
