The Daily Trojan feels that it is
"sad" that U.S.C. coaches do not
have nicknames. Consequently they
suggest that Howard Jones should
be renamed "King" Jones. Now tra
ditions are wonderful things to have
around a campus. They add to the
color and romance like an old fam
ily rug. It must not be forgotten,
however, that traditions are not
manufactured like so many "Ford"
cars or "Lngersoll" watches. They
spring in some mysterious and spon
taneous fashion from college life—
unprovoked and unheralded.

It is indeed praiseworthy that the
Trojan should desire to initiate tra
ditions; but we have a feeling that
their efforts are doomed to failure.
Firstly, their choice was unfortun
ate. "King" Jones—what fond mem
ories lhat nickname could evoke.
Why not choose Emperor, Chief and
Lord Potentate, Grand and Accepted
High-all, or some equally affection
ate title? You can stick by a "Pop"
or a "Boy Coach" in defeat; but
whoever heard of "Kings" accepting
defeat. If Jones should ever lose a
season with the cognomen of "King"
grafted on to his regular name, it
might give the sports writers won
derful lines "about a dethroned
King"; but it would probably spell
ridicule among the students. But
perhaps they do not contemplate any
defeats down at U.S.C. If so, the
name "King" is probably excellent.
Sound the trumpets! Sweep the
throne room's marbled floor! All hail
the King! Long live Jones!

But whatever nickname U.S.C.
fastens upon its coach is of rela
tively little importance. The atti

| tude, however, that seeks to artifi
! daily create traditions is interesting.
It is a typically American pastime—
! not only in colleges but in other
i phases of our life as well. We in
I America are so overawed by the
: age and tradition of Europe, that we
i are continually seeking to graft on
to our national life, modified phases
| of European custom in the hope that
: they will take root and bloom anew
j —and bloom prolificly with typical
I Yankee efficiency. »

Liveries for servants are accepted
j in Europe (we are told); but when
I movie stars attempt garbing their
chauffeurs in heavily braided uni-
J forms—decorated with as much en-
I signias as a revolutionary general's
—it becomes jj'ositively ludicrous.
Coats-of-arms mean something
where they have a long history; but
; when every person who begins pay
: ing income tax on a million dollars
has some poster artist devise him a
coat-of-arms that would do credit
! to any radiator cap or hub trade
' mark, it is positively asinine.

Similarly, there are folks on the
S Farm who desire the institution of
I any number of traditions, still ob
sessed with the idea that they can
j be secured by the passing of a reso
i lution or some such procedure. Tra
! ditions at Stanford grew from the
I environment, and they are dying as
(he environment that gave them life
iis changing. There are still some
I optimistic souls, like ourselves, who
| hope against hope that some of these
; heritages of the past may be retained
j in memory of the Stanford that used
i to be, even when it seems evident
: that it is impossible.
