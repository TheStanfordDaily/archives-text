# Cabbages and Things

### 
Every once in so often a true phil
anthropist, one of nature's noblemen,
breaks forth in a deluge of advice
for the lovelorn youth of the nation.
Not calling ourselves nice names, or
anything, but we'd love to save a
couple of gullible souls from anni
hilation in the local battle of Mara
thon.

The funniest thing published
yesterday (outside of Cabbages,
of course) was a statement that
"no violations of the Interfrater
nity Council Rushing Rules have
been reported this season."
Where are your eyes, boys?

Of course, there is some consola- !
I tion to participants in the contest, in |
I the fact that everyone knows some- j
! thing fairly scandalous about every- |
| body else, so they're pretty safe. But j
the frosh don't always know that. 1
i So, a word of counsel:
Always remember, fellows,
that it's the name of a fraternity
that counts. Makes no difference
whatsoever whether the mem
bers are all absolutely unbear
able. If the name is good, take it. j
And of course, if your friends in j
' New Hampshire belong to XXX, j
j join that house here, even if you j
i loathe the boys in this chapter. You II
| have to live with this gang for three
j years or soâ€”but you might take a |
! trip East sometime. My!
i 1
The men who are rushing you,
being honorable Stanford gen
tlemen, told you the first time
you went to their house that the
ritzy furniture was rented, and
will go back on the first of next
month. Rut don't mind that.

They always have belter stuff
put away in the attic, anyhow.
The most important thing about
! choosing your fraternity is its situa
' tion among the sororites .You sim
j ply must live near some attractive
! women, so that you'll know some
three years from now. And in this
i day, when travelling from place to
| place is so difficult, that makes a lot
I of difference.

Another thing is to pick a
house on good terms with near
by bootleggers, ami whose mem
bers obviously consume gallons
per evening. That gives you a
nice opportunity for Red Cross
work, when you're a sophomore
and taking orders from the rest
of them.

Meanwhile, just one word of gripe
in behalf of the Women's Gym com- 1
mittee. The frosh answering this j
most quickly and accuratley will be j
permitted to write Cabbages som? j
day next week:
Which one of the 24 gangs of
hoodlums gave a beach party
during the past week? Or who
the devil walked off with $40
worth of red beach umbrella
from the gym last Saturday?
The ladies just love big, strong,
sun-tanned men, so what do you
need the thing for?
A lot of luck, youngsters, and 1
