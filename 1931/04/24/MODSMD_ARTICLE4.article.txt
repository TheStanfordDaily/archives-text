## Bourbon Head Flays Fess In Counter Assault 
### 
I
WASHINGTON; April 23. (/P).â€” ;
A charge by Chairman Fess of the i
Republican National Committee that |
Jouett Shouse was guilty of a "de- |
liberate lie" in a recent San Fran- j
cisco" speech brought an assault on !
the Ohio senator today from the (
chairman of the Democratic Nation- 1
al Executive Committee.
In two statements issued from na- j
tional headquarters, Shouse said 1
Fess should have substantiated his j
facts before attributing to him a j
statement that the Republican or- |
ganization purchased 10,000,000 cop- I
ies of an eastern magazine carrying j
an article by Robert Cruise McMan- :
us, a newspaperman, attacking the j
religion of Chairman Raskob of the j
Democratic National Committee.
Denies Statement
Fess based his statement on a San i

Francisco newspaper account of |
Shouse's speech in that city April j
15. Shouse said he never made such j
a statement.
"Based on an alleged statement of
facts wholly without foundation," 1
Shouse added, "Dr. Fess accuses me j
of having been guilty of a 'delibcr- (
ate lie.'
"Short, Ugly Word"
"The short and ugly word is one i
that gentlemen are very careful i
about using, and any man having!
the slightest regard for his reputa
tion, particularly a man occupying
high official or political position,
might be expected to substantiate !
the facts about any alleged incident
before he assumes to voice them." j
Shouse also denied the newspaper
statement quoted by Fess to the ef- ,
feet that he spoke of the anti-
Raskob incident in the mistaken be
lief that his speech was not being I
broadcast at that time.
