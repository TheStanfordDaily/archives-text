GARDENER OF EVIL—By Pierre
Loving. Brewer and Warren, Inc.
1931. (At the Palo Alto Bock
Shop.)
"Gardener of Evil" is a brilliantly
I morbid portrait of Baudelaire,
France's most striking poet, and his
j times. Biography, even of a man as
; unusual as Baudelaire, often tends
j toward dullness, but this has been
i skilfully disguised and written as a
' novel.
Pierre Loving is an American who
! has become recognized as an au
! thority on the French poet and his
works. His biography has an air of
plausibility and reality which indi
i cates a deep and wide knowledge of
j his subject on the part of the author.
His style is heavy, rather in the
I manner of Edgar Poe. The poet is
I portrayed as morbid, sensitive, and
I extravagantly introspective. The
j characters, almost without exception,
! are excellently drawn.
i This is not exactly a pleasant book

! and certainly makes anything bui
1 light reading. —S.C.A.

MEN DISLIKE WOMEN—By Mi

Michael Arlen, having gained a

1 novels of declasse characters, is ap

' is written in a light, airy style, with
much less success than preceding
j stories.
; The hero, a wealthy young French
i nobleman, during a visit to New

j of three charming friends. With no
little satire, Arlen helps him through
