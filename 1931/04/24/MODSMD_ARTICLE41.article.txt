## SUBSIDIZE THE UNSELFISH 
### 
J The Editor, Sir:
Some $150 will be given annually
jto the senior student at Barnard
College who has made her unselfish
ness conspicuous enough and con
| ventional enough to attract the at
| tention of lord knows what unquali
fied judges.
Rewards are abundant in the
| modern stereotyped world; attrac
' tive salaries and cash bonuses are
! offered for magnetic personalities
| (obtainable for $25 and 15 minutes a
day through any popular magazine),
1 by the best obese bond brokers and
social climbers; musicians, writers,
j artists of every sort, have but to
please the annointed judges, turn out
i trite stuff for a public afraid of
! originality, and SUCCESS is theirs;
J athletes play for money, and others
I don't—it is much easier to shell out
a dollar and watch the hirelings
i sweat. As yesterday's editorial indi-
I cates, colleges are rewarding the ap-
I proved sort of excellence in every
| approved field, in which individual
1 personality plays a small part.

i It is a great step fox-ward, then,
this unique recognition of such an
unquestionable virtue in college.
The modern tendency is toward the
stereotyped life. Originality and
'sincerity have no place in it; in the
hurry of money-grabbing there is
no time for unprofitable action. How
admirable, then, that at last virtue
is to be made profitable! Perhaps,
j with the help of our respected
I alumni, we can establish endow
! ments to subsidize humor, gaiety,
emotional sensitivity, friendship, and
love! A two-dollar reward for the
wittiest bit of repartee, four dollars
I for the deepest sob at a heart -
| wrenching movie, twenty dollars for
. the most enduring friendship, fifty
' dollars for the most ardent love let
! ter.
| What's that? These things are joy
jin themselves, their own reward?
Don't be silly, my dear! This is 1931.
I MONEY'S the thing!
