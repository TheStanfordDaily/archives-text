MORE TEARS
California's "Bronx Cheer," sports
gossip column of the Berkeley stu
dent publication, lias again burst
into tears, this time over the fact
hat Captain Spud Mossnian failed to
Jreak the Big Meet record of 9:38.2
n the two-mile. Not only is the U.C.
.port writer disgruntled over Mr.
VTossman's failure, but he seems
horoughly convinced that it was the
ault of Dink Templeton, Johnny
3 arker, and Paul Aebersold. Here
ire a few thing that the California
vriter had to say in Tuesday morn
ng's paper:
'It was not Stanford's fault
that Mossman equaled the rec
ord. It was Stanford's fault that
the record was not broken. It
was Parker, a mediocre two
milcr, that prevented Mossman,
a two-miler, from setting
a new record. Parker played
stop and go with the Bear cap
tain until the stands sent up a
loud chorus in protest.
"There seem to be only two pos
ible reasons for Parker's actions,
'lossman and Parker have run
gainst each other twice before,
hey both ran the mile as freshmen
nd they both raced in the two-mile
ist year. The only two reasons for
is action, then, seem to be that he
/as either put up to it by "Dink"
Vmplcton or that he and Aeber
dd, the Cardinal runner that placed
•cond to Mossman, worked out the
lan together.
"Aebersold has a reputation
on the coast of not being a very
clean runner. Before the race
Saturday, Aebersold did his best
to get Mossman's goat. Mossman
is too experienced a runner to
be upset by a mediocre two--
niiler like Aebersold. When they
were warming up. Aebersold
asked the Bear captain. 'You are
Mossman. aren't you? 1 have
heard <iuile a bit about you as a
runner, and ! have been waiting
for a chance to race you for a
long time.'
"If Templeton worked out the lit- !
* plan, it was probably to prevent !
record going from a Stanford man j
a California man. Mossman de- {
rved to break the record. He would j
ive broken the record, but for j
irker. We wonder how they feel i
iout it down on the farm. Anyway, j
ey stili have some kind of a hold j
i the record."
In the first place, it seems to
us that Mossman, admittedly the
best two-iniler on the coast,
lacks one of the abilities to de
serve the title of "great." In
stead of jockeying around wait
ing for one of Stanford's medi
ocre two-milers to set the pace,
why didn't Spud go ahead and
set his own pace, out in front of
the rest of the pack? His burst
j of speed at the finish showed
that he had been running too
slow all the way.
<♦> \»>
i True, Parker jockeyed with Moss
j man, but track meets are track
j meets. Probably the writer of the
| "Bronx Cheer" didn't notice that
i two members of the U.C. track team
were stationed at the turns for the
; express purpose of bothering Aeber
sold. Each time the Indian runner
passed mem they would yell, virtu
ally in his ear, "You're all tired out,
you'll never last another lap." Then
I Mossman crowded Aebersold against
J the inside curb on the turns. It's all
j in a meet, but Paul took it without
a word, while Spud, as soon as he
! found he has not broken the record,
i whimpered about it to Aebersold,
Parker, Templeton, and sundry of
' ficials.
Perhaps you noticed what led
| to the disqualification of little
Allan Storms. It looked to us
as though the Blue and Gold
runner keeping pace with him
stepped on his heels often, and
then crowded Storms until Al
lan tried to push him off.
j <S> «$> ■$'
The "Bronx Cheer," we grant you,
has to search far and wide for sub
jects of conversation, since it's very
difficult to write about teams that
i are continually on the short end of
j lop-side scores. But we feel that
j humanity would benefit if said col
| umn would turn off the tears.
Churchill went ahead and
broke the record he was after;
did it thoroughly and beauti
fully. Had he fallen down a bit,
in all probability students across
the bay would have been in
formed by Mr. Bronx Cheer that
Dink Templeton had poisoned
Churchill's coffee, or that Boeger
tripped the Bear champion as
he was about to send out the
record-breaking toss.

MORE TEARS
California's "Bronx Cheer," sports
gossip column of the Berkeley stu
dent publication, lias again burst
into tears, this time over the fact
hat Captain Spud Mossnian failed to
Jreak the Big Meet record of 9:38.2
n the two-mile. Not only is the U.C.
.port writer disgruntled over Mr.
VTossman's failure, but he seems
horoughly convinced that it was the
ault of Dink Templeton, Johnny
3 arker, and Paul Aebersold. Here
ire a few thing that the California
vriter had to say in Tuesday morn
ng's paper:
'It was not Stanford's fault
that Mossman equaled the rec
ord. It was Stanford's fault that
the record was not broken. It
was Parker, a mediocre two
milcr, that prevented Mossman,
a two-miler, from setting
a new record. Parker played
stop and go with the Bear cap
tain until the stands sent up a
loud chorus in protest.
"There seem to be only two pos
ible reasons for Parker's actions,
'lossman and Parker have run
gainst each other twice before,
hey both ran the mile as freshmen
nd they both raced in the two-mile
ist year. The only two reasons for
is action, then, seem to be that he
/as either put up to it by "Dink"
Vmplcton or that he and Aeber
dd, the Cardinal runner that placed
•cond to Mossman, worked out the
lan together.
"Aebersold has a reputation
on the coast of not being a very
clean runner. Before the race
Saturday, Aebersold did his best
to get Mossman's goat. Mossman
is too experienced a runner to
be upset by a mediocre two--

asked the Bear captain. 'You are

MORE TEARS
California's "Bronx Cheer," sports
gossip column of the Berkeley stu
dent publication, lias again burst
into tears, this time over the fact
hat Captain Spud Mossnian failed to
Jreak the Big Meet record of 9:38.2
n the two-mile. Not only is the U.C.
.port writer disgruntled over Mr.
VTossman's failure, but he seems
horoughly convinced that it was the
ault of Dink Templeton, Johnny
3 arker, and Paul Aebersold. Here
ire a few thing that the California
vriter had to say in Tuesday morn
ng's paper:
'It was not Stanford's fault
that Mossman equaled the rec
ord. It was Stanford's fault that
the record was not broken. It
was Parker, a mediocre two
milcr, that prevented Mossman,
a two-miler, from setting
a new record. Parker played
stop and go with the Bear cap
tain until the stands sent up a
loud chorus in protest.
"There seem to be only two pos
ible reasons for Parker's actions,
'lossman and Parker have run
gainst each other twice before,
hey both ran the mile as freshmen
nd they both raced in the two-mile
ist year. The only two reasons for
is action, then, seem to be that he
/as either put up to it by "Dink"
Vmplcton or that he and Aeber
dd, the Cardinal runner that placed
•cond to Mossman, worked out the
lan together.
"Aebersold has a reputation
on the coast of not being a very
clean runner. Before the race
Saturday, Aebersold did his best
to get Mossman's goat. Mossman
is too experienced a runner to
be upset by a mediocre two--
niiler like Aebersold. When they
were warming up. Aebersold
asked the Bear captain. 'You are
Mossman. aren't you? 1 have
heard <iuile a bit about you as a
runner, and ! have been waiting
for a chance to race you for a
long time.'
"If Templeton worked out the lit- !
* plan, it was probably to prevent !
record going from a Stanford man j
a California man. Mossman de- {
rved to break the record. He would j
ive broken the record, but for j
irker. We wonder how they feel i
iout it down on the farm. Anyway, j
ey stili have some kind of a hold j
i the record."
In the first place, it seems to
us that Mossman, admittedly the
best two-iniler on the coast,
lacks one of the abilities to de
serve the title of "great." In
stead of jockeying around wait
ing for one of Stanford's medi
ocre two-milers to set the pace,
why didn't Spud go ahead and
set his own pace, out in front of
the rest of the pack? His burst
j of speed at the finish showed
that he had been running too
slow all the way.
<♦> \»>
i True, Parker jockeyed with Moss
j man, but track meets are track
j meets. Probably the writer of the
| "Bronx Cheer" didn't notice that
i two members of the U.C. track team
were stationed at the turns for the
; express purpose of bothering Aeber
sold. Each time the Indian runner
passed mem they would yell, virtu
ally in his ear, "You're all tired out,
you'll never last another lap." Then
I Mossman crowded Aebersold against
J the inside curb on the turns. It's all
j in a meet, but Paul took it without
a word, while Spud, as soon as he
! found he has not broken the record,
i whimpered about it to Aebersold,
Parker, Templeton, and sundry of
' ficials.
Perhaps you noticed what led
| to the disqualification of little
Allan Storms. It looked to us
as though the Blue and Gold
runner keeping pace with him
stepped on his heels often, and
then crowded Storms until Al
lan tried to push him off.

The "Bronx Cheer," we grant you,
has to search far and wide for sub
jects of conversation, since it's very
difficult to write about teams that
i are continually on the short end of
j lop-side scores. But we feel that
j humanity would benefit if said col
| umn would turn off the tears.
