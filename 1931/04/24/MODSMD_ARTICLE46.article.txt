MORE TEARS
California's "Bronx Cheer," sports
gossip column of the Berkeley stu
dent publication, lias again burst
into tears, this time over the fact
hat Captain Spud Mossnian failed to
Jreak the Big Meet record of 9:38.2
n the two-mile. Not only is the U.C.
.port writer disgruntled over Mr.
VTossman's failure, but he seems
horoughly convinced that it was the
ault of Dink Templeton, Johnny
3 arker, and Paul Aebersold. Here
ire a few thing that the California
vriter had to say in Tuesday morn
ng's paper:
'It was not Stanford's fault
that Mossman equaled the rec
ord. It was Stanford's fault that
the record was not broken. It
was Parker, a mediocre two
milcr, that prevented Mossman,
a two-miler, from setting
a new record. Parker played
stop and go with the Bear cap
tain until the stands sent up a
loud chorus in protest.
"There seem to be only two pos
ible reasons for Parker's actions,
'lossman and Parker have run
gainst each other twice before,
hey both ran the mile as freshmen
nd they both raced in the two-mile
ist year. The only two reasons for
is action, then, seem to be that he
/as either put up to it by "Dink"
Vmplcton or that he and Aeber
dd, the Cardinal runner that placed
•cond to Mossman, worked out the
lan together.
"Aebersold has a reputation
on the coast of not being a very
clean runner. Before the race
Saturday, Aebersold did his best
to get Mossman's goat. Mossman
is too experienced a runner to
be upset by a mediocre two--
niiler like Aebersold. When they
were warming up. Aebersold
asked the Bear captain. 'You are
Mossman. aren't you? 1 have
heard <iuile a bit about you as a
runner, and ! have been waiting
for a chance to race you for a
long time.'
"If Templeton worked out the lit- !
* plan, it was probably to prevent !
record going from a Stanford man j
a California man. Mossman de- {
rved to break the record. He would j
ive broken the record, but for j
irker. We wonder how they feel i
iout it down on the farm. Anyway, j
ey stili have some kind of a hold j
i the record."
In the first place, it seems to
us that Mossman, admittedly the
best two-iniler on the coast,
lacks one of the abilities to de
serve the title of "great." In
stead of jockeying around wait
ing for one of Stanford's medi
ocre two-milers to set the pace,
why didn't Spud go ahead and
set his own pace, out in front of
the rest of the pack? His burst
