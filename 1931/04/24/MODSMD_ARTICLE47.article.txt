# Indians Doped to Win P. A. A. Meet
## TEMPLETON'S MEN MEET OLD RIVALS IN KEZAR STADIUM California, Olympic Club, S.F.U. Teams Compete With Redshirts 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Dink Templeton's powerful Car
dinal track squad will enter as fa
vorites tomorrow afternoon in the
annual Pacific Amateur Association
meet at Kezar Stadium in San Fran
cisco, competing against teams from
the Olympic Club, California, and
San Francisco University, and vari
ous unattached athletes of the Bay
I region.
Chief competition will simmer
down to a triangular rivalry among
, the Indians, the Bears, and the
Winged "O" stars, with every indi
cation pointing to a Stanford tri
! umph. Last year the clubmen
| walked out with first-place honors,
j but the Templeton outfit has al-
I ready pi'oved itself a stronger team
than that of 1930.
Ilahies Out
Les Hables, Indian sprinter, is out
of the hospital following an ap
pendicitis attack, but it is highly
improbable that hewill appear at
: the starting line in the 100- and
220-yard dashes tomorrow.
Hables' absence will leave two
i very competent gentlemen, Hoc
Dyer and' Frank Lombardi, to ac
count for Stanford in the sprints. Cy
1 Leland of the Olympic Club and
Montague, S.F.U. runner, finished
ahead of these two in a practice
| century on the Farm this week, but
we are looking for the situation to
be reversed in regular competition.
Power in Dashes
■ Besides Leland and Montague,
! Templeton's sprint stars will be up
against a formidable trio in Sparks
jof California, Ward, S.F.U., and
: Granucci of the Club. Under good
| weather conditions, Dyer and Lorn
j bardi should turn in very good times
j against a field of this caliber.
Ben Eastman should not find him
| self pressed hard in the quarter or
; half, whichever event he enters. Bob ;
Brown can be counted on for points '
in the mile, while no two-mile is ,
scheduled.
The weight events should be in- !
teresting, with Eric Krenz, last |
year's Stanford captain, competing '
against this season's Farm crop of
weight-tossers. Ken Churchill of
California will go practically un
challenged in the javelin.
Africa diamond mines were dis- I
covered in 1876.

vorites tomorrow afternoon in the
annual Pacific Amateur Association
meet at Kezar Stadium in San Fran
cisco, competing against teams from
the Olympic Club, California, and
San Francisco University, and vari
ous unattached athletes of the Bay
I region.
Chief competition will simmer
down to a triangular rivalry among
, the Indians, the Bears, and the
Winged "O" stars, with every indi
cation pointing to a Stanford tri
! umph. Last year the clubmen
| walked out with first-place honors,
j but the Templeton outfit has al-
I ready pi'oved itself a stronger team
than that of 1930.
Ilahies Out
Les Hables, Indian sprinter, is out
of the hospital following an ap
pendicitis attack, but it is highly
improbable that hewill appear at
: the starting line in the 100- and
220-yard dashes tomorrow.
Hables' absence will leave two
i very competent gentlemen, Hoc
Dyer and' Frank Lombardi, to ac
count for Stanford in the sprints. Cy
1 Leland of the Olympic Club and
Montague, S.F.U. runner, finished
ahead of these two in a practice
| century on the Farm this week, but
we are looking for the situation to
be reversed in regular competition.
Power in Dashes
■ Besides Leland and Montague,
! Templeton's sprint stars will be up
against a formidable trio in Sparks
jof California, Ward, S.F.U., and
: Granucci of the Club. Under good
| weather conditions, Dyer and Lorn
j bardi should turn in very good times
j against a field of this caliber.
Ben Eastman should not find him
| self pressed hard in the quarter or
; half, whichever event he enters. Bob ;
Brown can be counted on for points '
in the mile, while no two-mile is ,
scheduled.
The weight events should be in- !
teresting, with Eric Krenz, last |
year's Stanford captain, competing '
against this season's Farm crop of
weight-tossers. Ken Churchill of
California will go practically un
challenged in the javelin.
Africa diamond mines were dis- I
covered in 1876.
