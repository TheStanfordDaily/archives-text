## MacNaughton – Trautman Tilt Will Be Feature Of Title Play 
### 
j Aside from the prospective Eich
elberger-Seaver struggle, no quar
ter-final match of the University
| golf championship will carry more
j interest than the MacNaughton
i Trautman clash.
MacNaughton, scratch man in
i Oregon, number one man on the
j Stanford team, California intercol
i legiate champion, is naturally fa
! vored. But because Trautman is
ranked at number two on the pow
: erful frosh squad, ahead of Lawson
. Little, Mac is only slightly favored.
Their match is to consist of 36
i holes match play and will be played
! some day next week on the Stanford
course. *
The winner has to face the victor
' in the Stevenson-Hellman contest in
the semi-finals. Herm Hellman is
the logical man to come out on top
since he is ranked fifth on the var
sity. Captain Stevenson is the pres
ent holder of ninth position, but his
fine showing in the 1930 Del Monte
intercollegiate tourney, which he
won for Stanford, puts him almost
,on a par with his opponent.
Gene Brown and Lawson Litlle,
both ranking freshmen, oppose each
other in the fourth quarter-final
i match. Although Little has been
j beaten once this year by Brown in
a ladder match, his capture of the
Northern California amateur title
last week-end makes him the heavy
' favorite to reach the semi-finals,
where he meets either Seavcr or
1 Eichlberger.
