# CARDS FAVORED TO WIN WATER POLO TOURNEY
## Varsity Defends Record In Four-Way Meet Today In Encina Pool 
### 
Although favored to win in the |
Men's Junior International water j
polo matches, the Stanford varsity |
will have tough competition in the j
experienced teams from the Olympic j
Club, the.Athens Club, and Sequoia i
High School of Redwood City. Pre- j
liminaries are this afternoon at 3:30 '
o'clock with the finals and a diving j
exhibition by Pete Desjardins, i
Olympic champion, at 1:30 o'clock
tomorrow in the Encina pool.

The team defending Stanford's un
defeated record against the invaders j
includes: forwards, Austin Clapp, 1
â€¢Frank Booth, and Paul de Silva; :
backs, Captain White Burns, Larry !
Harris, and Ward- Woods; goal, Mac i
Linton. This squad has had a bril- ;
liant season, especially in defeating j
the U.S.C. team, led by Crabbe, for !
the Pacific Coast championship in
the minor sports carnival April 11 j
at Los Angeles.

The ability of the contenders and j
past records of matches won indi- !
cate action and rough, fast, games 1
beyond the usual expect in !
water polo. With the Athens Club |
is Driggs, former Stanford star back. J
| The Olympic Club brings Dunn and |
! Christiansen with about ten years j
i of experience, and the Sequoia team I
will probably hold a surprise since i
they have defeated all the high
j schools in the vicinity and made a j
j clean sweep on an expedition to Los |
I Angeles.
This district is one of the strong
est in the United States in water
polo, and the local teams are equal
to any junior national contenders. '
On account of the national import
ance of the matches with an eye to
ward the Olympic games in 1932,
1 a great deal of prestige will come to
1 the winning team tomorrow.
