# Honduran Federals Drive Rebels From Railway Key Point
## Fierce Attack Continuing in San Pedro Area Defeats All Attempts to Estimate Casualty List; Communication Lines Reopened 
### 
Honduras, April 23. (/P) â€”Federal troops turned hack
the rebel forces today in a desperate battle at Chamclecon, driving
the enemy out of the area and saving the rail head at San Pedro Sula, not
far away. In the past two days that sector has seen the most vicious
lighting since the rebellion began. The rebels attacked once, were repulsed;
attacked again and were driven off, they spent all they had in the battle
today. A total of 2!) dead and many wounded was counted in yesterday's
fighting in several minor engagements, but so fierce was the battle being

; fought in the San Pedro Sula area
! that it was impossible to estimate
I the casualties there.
The battle at Chamelecon, which
i has for its prize the railway key
> point at San Pedro Sula, between
Tegucigalpa and the coast, began
i Tuesday night. The government
J forces repelled an attack on the town
and there was a lull, but the attack
; was renewed yesterday afternoon.
I Railway communications between
San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortes
| were resumed today and the federal
j forces, leaving a guard for the line,
I prepared to press their advantage
! and pursue the enemy.
The government is claiming im
| portant victories all along the line,
j but the losses at Chamelecon have
[ not been estimated. Yesterday 29
! men were killed and many wounded
|in a series of minor engagements
along the north coast, where the
| rebels succeeded in paralyzing wire
! communications with Tegucigalpa.
A strong group of rebels were re
i ported in advices from San Salvador
| to have been captured and interned
Iby Salvadorean authorities when
! they attempted to invade Honduras
from that point. Under the leader
j ship of Ladislao Vasqucz and Pedro
1 H. Ordonez, they were said to have
| been planning an attack on the Valle
district near Fonseca Bay.
