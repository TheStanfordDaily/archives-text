# ENGLISH REPLY TO NAVAL PROPOSALS RECEIVED IN PARIS
## 
### 
PARIS, April 26 (A*).â€”Great Bri
tain's reply to the French note in
connection with the tri-partite naval
treaty, which is believed to contain
counter-proposals, was received in
Paris today. The Foreign Office and
the minister of marine began to
study it immediately.
The French note offered to go
ahead with the naval accord, leav
ing the question of 1934-1936 super
annuated tonnage until 1935.
Le Temps points out tonight that
if the reply makes fresh proposals,
instead of flatly rejecting the old
ones, there still is hope for a Fran
co-Italian accord. However, there is
a strain of pessimism in other quar
ters. The general belief is that the
whole situation is the result of the
method of R. L. Craigie, British ad
miralty expert, in negotiating sep
arately with Paris and Rome.
The French feel that they arc not
to blame inasmuch as it was Great
Britain which conducted the nego
tiations.
