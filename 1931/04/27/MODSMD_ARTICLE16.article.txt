# B.A.C. ASSURES PAVILION HEAT
## Cost Survey To Be Made Soon, Says Masters 
### 
Installation of a heating system in '
the Pavilion was assured yesterday j
by Alfred E. Masters, general man- !
ager of the Board of Athletic Con- |
trol.
"The project will be completed |
some time this spring or during the |
summer," Masters declared. "We j
plan on installing a system which j
will use steam from the power !
house. Piping into the Pavilion, as !
well as the equipment in the build
ing itself, will be expensive, and it â€¢
may be necessary, in addition, to 1
disturb the Pavilion floor. However, j
efforts are being made to formulate j
plans which will avoid this diffi
culty."
The $1,000 offered by the BA.C.
by a recent Executive Committee
action will be accepted, Masters said.
A cost survey has not yet been
completed, according to Alfred L.
Trowbridge, assistant comptroller,
but figures are expected to be avail
able within a few days.
The system upon which the comp
troller's office is basing its estimates j
is the same as those in the Press 1
Building and in the new Roble gym. j
