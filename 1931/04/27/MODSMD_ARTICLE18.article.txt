# WARSHIPS NEAR REBEL MADEIRA
## Portuguese Send Vessels To Quell Uprising 
### 
I FUNCHAL, Madeira, April 2<> (/P).
;â€”A tense expectancy settled over
! Funchal today, as military and ci
| vilian residents awaited arrival of
! the Portuguese armada which has
been sent to put down the rebellion
! started here a few weeks ago.
Since departure of the liner Ar
i madale Castle Friday, which carried
j away more than 100 visitors, the
| only foreigners on the island are the
j staffs of business concerns who were
j unwilling to leave their posts. Ev-
I ery soldier has joined the revolt, but
j civilian islanders have remained
aloof from military service. How
i ever, their attitude toward the rebel
i junta is definitely sympathetic.
! At first reports of the approach of
i the punitive force from Lisbon many
islanders fled from Funchal to the
j hills. Most of them have now re
turned.
As to the Portuguese blockade of
the island, rebel leaders assert they
could hold out three months if noth-
S ing but economic pressure were ap-
I plied.
j Whatever the outcome, it is said
i in many quarters here that no per
j manpnt peace is possible until Ma
j dcira is granted home rule.
