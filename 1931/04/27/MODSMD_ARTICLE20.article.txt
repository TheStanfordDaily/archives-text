# Senior Plates To Round Quad 5 Centuries Hence
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Five centuries will have rolled
away before Stanford senior classes
J arc confronted by the problem of
j space wherein to plant the class nu
i meral.
Speculations on the future march
' around the Quad arise with the
i casting last Saturday of the bronze
\ plate for this year's class. The plate,
: entailing 100 hours of work, at a
cost of $200, is being made in Ihe
University foundry by the Ameri
] can Society of Mechanical Engineers.
This year's yellow square, to all
outward appearances a replica of 38
I previous brasses displayed in the
, Quad, differs in one respect—and
j that as a medium of cheap advertis
ing. Seven creators of the plate—
| faculty members and students—have
i cast their names into the under side
| of the square, which as indelible
| data, may furnish hours of fervid
1 research to some post-future his
| torian.
"Daily" investigators who did
computative footwork along the
Quad report that 471 years remain
out of the original 500. Would-be
! grads of '91 will find themselves
' face-to-face with the source-stone
of the original '92, which was laid
in the presence of the University's
founders. But it will be a meeting of
I twentieth century and early twenty
! fifth; it will have the quaint flavor
i of Caesar meeting Sherman, or Beu

wulf with Ben Jonson.
I Children, grandchildren, and
great-grandchildren of the present
' senior class will still be in front of
the Mathematics Building. Nearly
|?? years must elapse before the
! bronze plates get to Ihe first corner,
I where they meet an initial barrier
I in the great circular designs which
decorate the corners of the Quad.
Modern custom must have crum
| pled to dust before (he classes swing
| past the threshold of the Music
I Building, and beyond that, the years
present a thirsty hike before they
j reach the drinking fountain.
A super-being will have devel
! oped in the far-away roughs who
! are to leave their bronze footsteps
' in front of the Little Theatre, and
! by the time of arrival at the Politi
j cat Science headquarters, the famil
i iar bronze square v/ill have been
laid aiside for one of radium-soaked
j platinum.
Other facts revealed by the arch
j investigators are that the class plates
j of '06 and '07 are mergfied into an
octagon, an explanatory gesture to
ward the earthquake-shaken gradu
ation plans.
Most sensational, however, is the
discovery that Stanford's Quad is
not a quad at all, but an isosceles
trapezoid. The Memorial Church side
contains three squares more than
its opposite.
