# FATE OF SHIPMENT OF SOVIET LUMBER TO BE DETERMINED
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 26 (A'). -
j Whether the Russian lumber cargo
lof the Finnish steamer Anversoise
| can be imported into the United
j States is expected to be decided to
-1 morrow by Under-Secretary of the
Treasury Mills.
However, his decision, which will
| determine the fate of the shipment,
[ brought to Providence, R. 1., last
i week, will fail to set a precedent for
j basing future answers to questions
j arising over Soviet Russian lumber.
Each shipment must stand upon
its merits, Treasury officials have
' announced, and its entry will de
i pend upon whether convicts played
j a part in its production. Russian
| lumber from north of latitude 60 has
| been barred as convict-produced.
