SAN FRANCISCO, April 27. (/!')
—Surveyors will start work today
on preliminaries for construction of
the long-planned $75,000,000 bridge
across San Francisco Bay, connect
ing this city and Oakland.
The surveys will begin on Yerba
Buena, island in the middle of the
bay which will separate the two big
spans of the structure. State High
way Engineer C. H. Purcell indi
cated the plotting of the crossing
and anchorage on the island should
be completed in two weeks.
Approval Sought
Purcell said he had been assured
the War Department in Washington
would approve plans for the bridge
and issue a formal permit for its
construction. The state then will
have to get rights of way from the;
War Department, the Navy Depart
ment, and the Commerce Depart
ment, all of which control property
on Yerba Buena. Congressional ap
proval for the bridge already has
been given. •
Meanwhile other legislation relat
ing to the bridge is pending before
the state legislature at Sacramento.
A Senate bill advances the toll
bridge authority $650,000 from 11n
state treasury for preliminary work.
Bids To Be Received
Another bill will forbid construc
tion of another bridge within five
miles, as a precautionary measure to
assure purchasers of the $75,000,000
bond issue that their investment is
protected from competition. Another
bill authorizes the State Department,
of Public Works to take over and
maintain the completed structure as
part of the State Highway system.
Bids are to be received soon for
construction of piers for the $35,-
000.000 bridge across the Golden
Gate. Thus within five years or so
the water barriers which have iso
lated San Francisco so long will be
broken.
