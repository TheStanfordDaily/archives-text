## 
### 
A I- MASTERS, general man
ager of the Board of Ath
letic Control, is worried.
"One-Eyed" Connelly, world
renowned "gate-crasher," is in
the vicinity, and the U.S.C.
track meet is only five days
away.
Connelly, who has crashed
practically all the important
hoxing matches in the country,
innumerable shows, and count
less other gates, is now operat
ing in San Jose.
It is rumored that Masters is
negotiating with the military
department to have machine
guns at every gate, with anti
aircraft guns mounted on the
rim of the Stadium to prevent
Connelly from dropping in on
the meet hy parachute, should
he succeed in hitch-hiking his
way up into the clouds.
