# HONOR TO THE ORCHESTRA
## 
### 
Deserved recognition of the excellence of the Stanford
orchestra is ils selection as the group to play in San Fran
cisco May 10 as the climax of the features of Music Week.
In the usual run of events, lillle attention is paid to this
campus group because it appears in public on relatively
few occasions each year.
Hut the high musical standards maintained by this
group and the ability of the individuals in the orchestra
combine to give Stanford a unique and worthwhile campus
activity. The enthusiasm of Chester \Y. Rosekranz, in
charge of Music "Week, upon bearing a rehearsal of the
orchestra is just one of the expressions of (lie approval and
appreciation which able music critics feel for the Stanford
orchestra.
