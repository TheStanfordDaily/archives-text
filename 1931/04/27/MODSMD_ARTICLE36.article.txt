# TOO MUCH DUMB POLITICS HERE ALREADY
## 
### 
Today's Bull Session is a plea for more politics at Stan
ford. "By escaping from the visible signs of open cam
paigning, Stanford is not placing itself above politics; we
are only sliding 'below' politics," Mrllinkoff declares.
The Hull Session would have us return to the days of
posters, stump speeches, and all the hullabaloo that ac
companies an election politically conducted. The Bull
Session would have us listen to campus orators expounding
on the merits and delects of the Honor Code, lecturing on
whether or not Stanford observes the provisions of the
Volstead Act, and setting forth "all the dope" for the mem
bers of the student electorate "who think."
Campaigning would lead to organization, and in all
likelihood campus political parties would emerge from
the scramble. Even without visible electioneering, there
lias been a regrettable tendency for parties to develop on
the campus, for the Hall voters to align themselves with
one group of candidates and for the Row voters to back
another set. In many colleges the party system of electing
student offices has been tried, and in but few of them has
it proven successful. The Oreyon Daily Emerald (Univer
sity of Oregon) last week wrote of the political situation
there as follows:
"The whole sorry matter sums up to this. Two parties
are built up without any issues between them to justify
their separate existence; rancour and bitterness which
sometimes leave permanent scars are generated for no
cause. So intent are the candidates upon beating out the
other gang, that no one lias time to present to the student
body any intelligent ideas for changes or reforms in stu
dent administration."
The Daii.v feels as does the Emerald that political par
lies have no place in a campus election. And open cam
paigning such as the Bull Session suggests seems certain to
bring about their development.
But the problem for which the Bull Session is trying to
offer a solution is a real one. Student government at Stan
ford means little because the individuals elected to office
are either incompetent or have no interest in the duties
they are supposed to perform. Elections here are taken
as a matter of course, and of little consequence. There are
a few of the many politically ambitious students who win
campus offices, who are chosen because of merit, but too
often candidates are elected because of athletic or social
prowess rather than because of any real lltness'for their
jobs.
Competent officers will not be elected at Stanford until
the voters take the trouble to interest themselves enough in
student government to find out who the candidates are and
what their respective abilities may be. Past experience
seems to indicate that Stanford students will never know
whom they are voting for or why they are even voting.
The Daily offers again its old, old answer to the ques
tion of what to do about Stanford student government.
Simplify it. Abolish most of the offices, already recognized
to be worthless, and give the campus voters so few candi
dates to think about thai they cannot help but choose
wisely.

As a result of student request, a "goddess" instead of
the traditional Queen of the May will be chosen to preside
over Temple College's annual May festival. Sophistication
is the outstanding characteristic of the present-day college
man.

sometimes leave permanent scars are generated for no
cause. So intent are the candidates upon beating out the
other gang, that no one lias time to present to the student
body any intelligent ideas for changes or reforms in stu
dent administration."
The Daii.v feels as does the Emerald that political par
lies have no place in a campus election. And open cam
paigning such as the Bull Session suggests seems certain to
bring about their development.
But the problem for which the Bull Session is trying to
offer a solution is a real one. Student government at Stan
ford means little because the individuals elected to office
are either incompetent or have no interest in the duties
they are supposed to perform. Elections here are taken
as a matter of course, and of little consequence. There are
a few of the many politically ambitious students who win
campus offices, who are chosen because of merit, but too
often candidates are elected because of athletic or social
prowess rather than because of any real lltness'for their
jobs.
Competent officers will not be elected at Stanford until
the voters take the trouble to interest themselves enough in
student government to find out who the candidates are and
what their respective abilities may be. Past experience
seems to indicate that Stanford students will never know
whom they are voting for or why they are even voting.
The Daily offers again its old, old answer to the ques
tion of what to do about Stanford student government.
Simplify it. Abolish most of the offices, already recognized
to be worthless, and give the campus voters so few candi
dates to think about thai they cannot help but choose
wisely.

As a result of student request, a "goddess" instead of
the traditional Queen of the May will be chosen to preside
over Temple College's annual May festival. Sophistication
is the outstanding characteristic of the present-day college
man.
Today's Bull Session is a plea for more politics at Stan
ford. "By escaping from the visible signs of open cam
paigning, Stanford is not placing itself above politics; we
are only sliding 'below' politics," Mrllinkoff declares.
The Hull Session would have us return to the days of
posters, stump speeches, and all the hullabaloo that ac
companies an election politically conducted. The Bull
Session would have us listen to campus orators expounding
on the merits and delects of the Honor Code, lecturing on
whether or not Stanford observes the provisions of the
Volstead Act, and setting forth "all the dope" for the mem
bers of the student electorate "who think."
Campaigning would lead to organization, and in all
likelihood campus political parties would emerge from
the scramble. Even without visible electioneering, there
lias been a regrettable tendency for parties to develop on
the campus, for the Hall voters to align themselves with
one group of candidates and for the Row voters to back
another set. In many colleges the party system of electing
student offices has been tried, and in but few of them has
it proven successful. The Oreyon Daily Emerald (Univer
sity of Oregon) last week wrote of the political situation
there as follows:
"The whole sorry matter sums up to this. Two parties
are built up without any issues between them to justify
their separate existence; rancour and bitterness which
sometimes leave permanent scars are generated for no
cause. So intent are the candidates upon beating out the
other gang, that no one lias time to present to the student
body any intelligent ideas for changes or reforms in stu
