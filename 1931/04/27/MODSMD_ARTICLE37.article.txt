# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
In a couple of weeks Stanford will
elect its student body officers.
There will be candidates from the
Row: there will be candidates from
the Hall; and there might be a few
scattered "independents" that don't
know any better. The Daily will
publish the names of the candidates;
there will be some button-holing;
there will be some boxes on the
Quad; the Daily will publish the
results of the election; the election
will be over.
Such a procedure is meaningless
and probably accounts for the small
number of students that vote. There
has grown up a tradition at Stan
ford that there is something low and
vulgar about using "political meth
ods" at an election. There are some
students who may be naive enough
to feel that our elections are "above
politics." These students should
realize' that as far as intrigue, pre
election promises, "vote-selling,"
and the like go, Stanford has more
than its share.
We go to the polls; and put little
marks in little squares, and walk
away smiling, thinking that student
government is a wonderful thing.
We vote for a certain name because
we heard the name somewhere be
fore or because our "group" is vot
ing that way. Can anyone blame us?
How else can we vote? Have we any
way of knowing the candidate's
stand on any of the students' prob
lems? Some cynics will claim that
there are no problems. True, there
are no problems upon which the fate
of a nation hangs. There are no
problems the decision of which will
alter the world's affairs and bring
mankind to the golden millenium.
But there are plenty ol' problems

in which the students are inter
ested: the Masque Ball—the Honor
Code—admission at athletic contests
rushing regulations -pre-pledging
periods of the eating clubs and a
host of others.
If we are going to go through the
motions of elections, why not make
them mean something? Why not
have assemblies where rival student
body -candidates can express their
stand on various issues?
Why not have posters telling the
passing throngs that Joe Bloke fa
vors the rigid enforcement of the
Honor Code? Recently, in the midst
of a furor over the Honor System,
we elected a men's council whose
chief business is the handling of this
problem. .Yet outside their immedi
date friends, did anyone know
whether they favored the retention
of the present system—or whether
they wanted a proctor system — or
whether they even had any ideas
on the subject?
Student government becomes a
farce—a meaningless farce—unless
we know what we are voting for.
It's bad enough in national politics
where candidates hedge on issues;
but here candidates don't even
hedge! By escaping from the visible
signs of open carnpaiging, Stanford
is not placing itself above politics;
we are only sliding "below" poli
tics. If student self-government is
to be either "student"—"self"—or
"government," we must devise some
ways to bring the candidate's stands
on issues before the campus. If not,
our so-called student control will
develop into a race between rival
living groups for the honor of cer
tain offices —whose catual signili
cance will fast approach the zero
point.. —Abe MellinkofT.
