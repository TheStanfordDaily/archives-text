IT'S A WISE CHILD—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
One mad jumble of misunder
standing, this movie. Good movie,
though. Marion Davies in what is
probably the best thing she's done,
if that means anything. The hero is
a trifle too heroic, and the rather
frayed subject of prospective ma
ternity is handled awkwardly, to
say the least, but there are plenty
of good spots. Many of the lines are
thoroughly amusing, and the acting,
on the whole, is quite commendable.
The thing's not exactly a wow,
but it will go as really entertaining
entertainment. —E.
THE CATTLE KING—By Edward
F. Tread well. Marmillan Company,
$3.00.
Stripped of all the romantic, but
still retaining the indefinable es
sence of romanticism, Treadwell's
biography of Henry Miller, whose
life was so involved in the develop
ment of California from the desert
wandering place of uncivilized In
dians of the "Garden of the West,"
is an epic of the self-made man, a
type of whom there have been many
in the American scene.
Miller, an immigrant butcher-boy,

landed in New York in 1847 with
' five dollars in his pocket and a
j burning desire to make his way m
the world. This biography of him is
written with a vigor, directness, and
breadth of view wholly appropriate
to the man and his times. It is good
, reading. —p. jj.
MR. LEMON OF ORANGE—At the
I Varsity* Theatre.
Playing a dual role—that of inno
cent Oscar from Minnesota, and
; dangerous McGee the gangster—El
Brendel has succeeded in making a
| better-than-expected, mildly amus
, ing performance that revolves
! around the murder of the rival gun-
I man.
Every incident happens just as it
j should, but it is supposed to be
i cofnedy, so the obviously weak
I points hardly matter anyway. El
i Brendel is just the same as ever,
1 and is allowed to make a few really
j funny remarks. There is no com
! parison between "Mr. Lemon" and
j "Just Imagine." The best thing about
i "Mr. Lemon" is that it follows an
1 exceedingly boring "trip" through
South Africa, and the comparison
; favors the comedy to a great extent,
i —J. N*.
