The tong war is practically all
over with, with only a few minor
stabs-in-the-back still scheduled for
dark nights during the next couple
of weeks. The blood is pretty well
cleaned off the streets, and only un
important parts of dismembered vic
tims stiil cluttering up the Row.
Net results: 205 hits, half as many
runs, and a hell of a lot of errors.
The referee was subsidized.
One interesting cross-cut from
the past week is a picture taken
on Thursday afternoon, 011 the
Sigma Chi lawn, where a some
what worried frosli was search
ing for the Phi Kap pledge pin
he d lost there. (No violations of
the Interfraternity Council rule
were reported (his season.)
Patrons, patronesses, and plain
worshippers of Bacchus, Terpischore
(that's a new one) and the Guy who
Invented Week-ends took a decided
rooking when the rain decided to
fall in bucketsful. Of course, the an
nual junior water carnival is com
ing up next Saturday, and a little
water would help.
Residents on Hoover Hill have
been considering everything
from police warrants to a long,
long ride for a braying donkey
that's been disturbing their late
morning slumbers. Keppiges
fixed it up all right, though.
It's only an A.T.O. who thinks
he's Joe E. Brown's soul—we
mean mouth-mate.
From all we could tel 1 011 Satur
day night, the new women's gym

I Roble women exclusively, since they
j seem to be the ones who are financ- i
j ing the finishing touches. With the j
j exclusion of a dozen or so of loyal |
j .souls, the Greek girls didn't show j
J enough interest in keeping the "per- j
feet 32" to spend even a couple of i
I hours in their own dance studio.

' title like that.)

j been better sports than that. Pic
