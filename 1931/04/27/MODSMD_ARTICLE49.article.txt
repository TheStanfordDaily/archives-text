IKON MAN LES
In reference to a track ath
lete, the term "iron man" usual
ly applies to one of these large
lunged young men who seems
to enjoy running hoth the mile
and the two-mile in one after
noon. Then there are strong men
like Ben Eastman, who broke
the tape in the 440, the BSO, and
the relay in one and the same
track meet. We nominate an
other Indian runner "iron man"
laurels, lie is neither a distance
runner nor a three-event man.
lie runs the dashes.
Leslie Irvin liubles, often referred
to as Abe, is our candidate for
"strong man" recognition. And his
qualifications, for the most part, are
hidden away in the files of the Palo
Alto Hospital, or in the office of the
registrar. Los has met and defeated
more obstacles than Hercules en
countered during the course of his
12 labors.
Hables came to Stanford in the
autumn of 15)27 itching to .do big
things for his alma mater on the
track. A few weeks before finals of
that quarter he began to have trou
ble with his eyes, and was unable
to take exams. Following a lot of
led tape and trouble, he was of
ficially credited with a zero minus
15 bawlout average, which put him
out and cramped his eligibility for
some two years.
But Lcs didn't quit. He came
hack as soon as possible and
waited until he became eligible
again this spring, contenting
himself in the meantime with
competition in odd meets here
and there, usually uuattaehed.
Early this year Les was at his
peak, heating Hee Dyer consist
ently in practice at unofficial
times of 9.7 and 9.6. Fans won
dered what would happen to
Frank Wykolt on May 2 if the
Indian star continued to im
prove.
Then the black cat returned, and
Hables ran into more trouble. First
he suffered a broken thumb. Not
long after that had healed, he threw
his knee out of joint and showed up
at the track on crutches. Refusing
to be kept out of it, Les ran Lhe
century a week later in the Big
Meet. A couple of days later, he was
reported in the hospital suffering
from appendicitis, and fear was ex
pressed that he might not be in
shape for the U.S.C. classic.

Again surprising all and sun
dry, Hables went up to Ke/ar
Saturday to run the hundred
close behind Dyer. The way
that young man recovers from
illnesses and injuries is no less
than phenomenal. Nothing short
of death should keep him from
meeting Frank Wykoff Satur
day. And though all this trouble
has slowed him down consider
ably, don't he astounded if you
see "Iron Man" Les breaking Mr.
WykoH's pet tape.
While on the subject of the Troy
meet, we might as well remind you
about those dope sheets. Somebody
was asking whether the name of
each point-winner in his placing
rji'der is required. It is. And here's
a suggestion. Don't forget, that this
man Hall of U.S.C., though not quite
up to snuff in the weights so far
.his year, last season tossed the clis
jus out 157 feet 7 inches and the
hot 48 feet 10 inches. The tendency
uound here has been to ignore Mr.
fall, something which might irritate
lim to new and greater distances.
The meet virtually hangs on the
performance of Hall Saturday.
