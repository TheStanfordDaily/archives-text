# Ben Eastman Sets Pacific Coast Record In 880
## CARD STAR STEPS 1:53.0 HALF MILE ON SLOPPY TRACK Indian Track Team Takes Second In P.A.A. Meet; Dyer Loses 100 
### 
Rain came along to dampen the
Pacific Association track meet at
i Kezar Saturday afternoon, but it
failed to shed a perceptible degree
of moisture upon the performance
I of Ben Bang Eastman.
i Eastman covered 880 yards of
I rain-soaked cinders in 1:53.0 to set
! a new P.A.A. record, and establish
j himself as the fastest half-miler in
; the history of intercollegiate compe-
I tition on these Pacific slopes.
As was the case when Eastman
I startled the sports world with a
I 1:52.0 half-mile in practice several
weeks ago, Ben ran his best official
880 practically alone and unpressed.
He was far out in front all the way,
and finished 45 yards ahead of his
nearest rival, Frank Young of the
Olympic Club.
Mud Spoils Interest
As for the meet itself, muck and
| mire, together with a lot of freak
i events which were run off none too
smoothly, sapped most of the inter
est. The Olympic Club retained the
championship in its favorite meet
by scoring 10G points to Stanford's
52.
California took third with 15,
S.F.U. followed with 6 points, Unione
Sportiva Virtus, 5, and unattached
athletes gathered the remaining 11
points.
Lyman Surprises
John Lyman, probably the world's
champion freshman shot-putter,
1 surprised the scattering of fans by
i tossing the IG-pound iron ball 48
! feet 2\ii inches to place second an
! inch behind Krenz of the Winged
; "O." Laborde barely bettered 47
' feet to take fourth.
