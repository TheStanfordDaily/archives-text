double victory over
St. Mary's down South last
week-end, while rain cancelled
Stanford's game with San Fran
cisco University, served only to
tighten the baseball situation.
Should the Indians lose 10
S.F.U. this Saturday, chances
arc ripe that U.S.C. will tie the
Redshirts for the conference
title by virtue of three yet-to
happen victories over U.C.L.A.
