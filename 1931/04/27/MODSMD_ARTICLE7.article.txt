# TRAFFIC CONTROLS FAIL TO FUNCTION DESPITE PROMISES
## 
### 
Although it was promised that the <
new traffic control lights at the in- I
tersection of Palm Drive and El
Camino Real would be ready for the 1
heavy traffic of Sunday, the lights |
were not yet ready for operation j
I yesterday.
No word has yet been received by j
| the authorities in Palo Alto from the j
i state highway commission concern- i
i ing the installation of the lights, |
which was started without their
permission.
In view of the difficulties which '
; have been encountered by the city
and the University in their endeavor '
to have the lights installed, Palo i
Alto will take steps as soon as pos- j
sible to acquire territory on either j
side of Embarcadero road from the i
city limits to the municipal lands on j
the bay front, as a means of assur
ing control over the Bayshore high- 1
way crossing, which will be con
structed in the near future.
If the state highway commission i
refuses to give its sanction for the
installation of the lights it is ex- j
pected that Palo Alto will claim the j
right to purchase the strip of land :
around the Palm Drive intersection
and so extend its authority to that
section of the highway.
