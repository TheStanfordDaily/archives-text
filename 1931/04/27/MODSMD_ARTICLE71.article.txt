# CONVALESCENT HOME Stanford's Own Charity PLANS ANNUAL DRIVE
## 
### 
Holding out its strong and helpful
arms to children of all nationalities
who are in need of its aid, the Stan
ford Convalescent Home has for 12
years stood on the old Stanford
homesite, as a living symbol of the
spirit in which the entire University
was founded.
Though it is an entirely independ
ent organization incorporated for
charitable and educational purposes,
the Convalescent Home is in every
sense Stanford's "Own Charity," and
it is to the student body of the Uni
versity that the Home is making its
annual appeal May 4, 5, and 6.
The A.S.S.U. committee in charge
of the campaign has announced that
a minimum goal of $4,000 has been
set for this year, which means an
average of slightly more than two
dollars per person, or the cost of
caring for one child for a day. This
care includes board and room, medi
cal attention, and supervised recrea
tion and instruction.
