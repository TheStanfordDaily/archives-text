LISBON, Portugal, April 27 (/P).â€” I
A general attack on the rebels in
Madeira was decided upon for to
morrow morning at a war council of i
superior officers of the Portuguese
government's expeditionary force.
The first engagement between the
rebels and the expeditionary force
took place today at Cannicel where |
federal troops went ashore, faced a
group of 75 rebels armed with ma
chine guns, and dismantled the San j
Lourenco wireless station.

Transport Shelled
The federal troops captured 17
prisoners. Their own casualties were
16 wounded.
The rebel artillery fired on the
transport Carvalho Araujo, under
cover of whose guns the landing
party went ashore, but was silenced
by accurate return fire from the
ship, supported by airplanes.
The attack on the San Lourengo
wireless station followed upon a se
ries of fruitless efforts by the gov
ernment to induce the rebels to sur
render. Proclamations were dropped
from airplanes on several occasions
during the past few days. The rebels
had been using the wireless station
to broadcast news.
Civilians Flee
The fray was of very short dura
tion. The rebels broke, scurrying in
all directions, leaving one sergeant
and 16 men in Ihe hands of the fed
eral troops.
When the warships Vasco da
Gama, Garvalho Araujo, Ibo, and
Zaire appeared off Funchal yester
day, inhabitants living on the sea
front abandoned their homes and
fled to the hills. The rebel authori
ties placarded the island with posters
urging the population to stand fast
"against tyranny."
Colonel Mendez do Rio, command
ing the rebel forces, issued an ortler
to his troops declaring that desertion
would be punished by death.
