S his now-famous caterwaul, has been

ings of sons to mothers.
The man who can justly claim the
I largest mouth in the world was sit
; ting before his make-up table, put
\ ting the final touches to his cn
j scmble, and stretching his facial
■ muscles.
"Just getting the old mouth
i warmed up for the performance,"
I Joe E. Brown explained. "How did
j I get such latitude? Well, it began
when I was a circus clown at the
age of nine, when a large painted
! grin was my chief asset.
"As a schoolboy I spent summers
; working in three different circuses,"
continued the words through the
1 world's largest mouth. "My first
manager beat me until I thought no
boy could be more wretched, but I

I soon found myself mistaken, as each
I succeeding circus manager proved
i to be even more tyrannical than the
! first.
"In the winter I would return to
school. I never told my mother
i about the treatment I received for
! fear of being kept at home, and the
I romance of the big top continued to
! balance the black and blue marks."
Asked if he saw the circus as ad
-1 visablc training for his own chil
dren, Brown denied himself as a
despotic parent, labeling it as their
i own affair. "Theatrical life," he
i went on to say, "is hard work and
unless you like it a lot, it can be
come the greatest drudge in the
, world."
Mr. Brown!" the stage
boy called, and our host arose as
Elmer, the greatest pitcher, by his
I own admission, that ever played
baseball. Joe E. Brown opened his
mouth to its greatest expansion and
I whispered a goodbye to rout the
last shreds of journalistic dignity.
