ie Karl, director of the water sports,
for the crcction of bleachers around
vtlie swiming pool to accommodate
spectators.
Mixed Relays
As an unusual feature of this
year's program women are to com
pete in special races. Of particular
interest among the events is the re
; lay race in which teams composed
!of two men and two women will
j compete. Cups will be awarded to
j the winners of the 100-yard free
style for men and the 50-yard free
style event for women.
Diving contests for both men and
women have been arranged in ad-
J dition to the famed duo, Pete Des
! jardins and Ed Throndson, who are
j to put on an exhibition in straight
I and fancy diving. Novelty events on
I the program include an egg and
j spoon race, a balloon race, and a
plunging contest with a definite time
limit. Medley relays with both sexes
vying for honors are to complete the
| schedule.
Canoe-Tilting
| Canoe-tilting, the crowning event
of the morning, will also be the last
attraction. Anyone who is not afraid
of a ducking and who wants a little
excitement may enter the fray, Karl
has announced. Each canoe has a
team of two men, one at the paddle
and the other armed with a long pole
padded with a boxing glove. Usually
the awkward efforts of one pair to
oust the other from their canoe af
ford the audience plenty of amusc
! ment.
Mrs. Botts, instructor in swim- i
! ming, assfsted by Beatrice Clyne, is
| arranging the women's events, and
j anyone desirous of entering the meet (
j is urged to communicate with her
j as soon as possible.
Seniors Entered
It is impossible as yet to predict
| winners of events and all entries
1 have not yet been turned in. Com- i
I petitors are not limited to the "high j
i and mighty" juniors, Ed Boyles, '
• class president, stated, and it is ex
! pected that the senior entrants will
i provide some pretty stiff competi
j tion.
"Lagunita may be dry but the
! carnival will go on just the same,"
' were the courageous words of the
j committee as they discussed plans j
, for the week-end activities.
