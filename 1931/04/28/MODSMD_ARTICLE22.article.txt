# SPANISH GARDEN IS SETTING DESIGNED FOR JUNIOR PROM
## 
### 
Transformed into a Spanish gar
den, the Pavilion will offer an en
chanting setting for the annual
Junior Prom to be held there on
Friday night.

Harold Howard and his "Aristo
crats," who have just finished a long
engagement at the Montmarte Cafe,
are to play for the dancers, accord
ing to Chairman Beverly Robinson.
This orchestra, which is composed
entirely of college students, is one
of the most popular on the West
Coast and has been extensively fea
tured at the Rendezvous Ballroom
in Balboa and the Embassy Club in
Hollywood.

Remaining bids for the prom are
on sale at the A.S.S.U. offices but
as there are only a few left students
arc urged to purchase them as soon
as possible. Programs for the dance
are white leather booklets with pas
tel colors appliqued on the leather.
These can be secured later this week
by presenting a bid at the offices in
the Old Union.
