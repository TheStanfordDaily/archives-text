## 
### 
Milking another bow before col
| logos and universities of the Pacific
Coast, "College Forum" appears in
! its sccond issue today on news
| stands throughout the West.
This new magazine, brain-child of
a group of writers closely associated
with the projects and problems of
the modern campus, first saw the
I light of day only last month, but
I already it has brought forth a storm
•of enthusiastic comment and dis
cussion.
Students and alumni of Stanford
took the leading role in the inau
guration of "College Forum." In the
issue appearing today, however,
California, St. Mary's, Santa Clara,
and the University of San Francisco
have rallied to the call, and arc
presenting stories and articles that
are destined—if not to win eternal
fame—at least to provide midnight
bullsessions with sufficient material
i to last many a month.
