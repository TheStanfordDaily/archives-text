# NOMINEES ARE SELECTED FOR PAN-HELLENIC
## Virginia Daugherty And Pauline Wilson Named For President MORGAN IS SECRETARY Final Balloting At House Meetings On Monday 
### 
Pauline Wilson and Virginia
Daugherty will be candidates for
the presidency of Pan-Hellenic So
ciety as a result of elections held in
all the sorority house meetings last,
night. Lucile Morgan was elected
secretaray of the organization for
next year. Final balloting will take
place in the house meetings next
Monday.
The election last night was held
to settle a tie between the second
and third candidates, incurred in
the first election last Monday night,
to determine which would run
against Pauline Wilson for president.
Miss Daugherty was chosen by the
house votes and Miss Morgan auto
matically received the office of sec
retary.
New System Used
A new system of choosing the of
ficers of Pan-Hellenic was put into
effect this year to replace the old
system of progressive rotation
among the houses for officers. Un
der the new method, three candi
dates are named by a nominating
committee, which is composed of
the outgoing officers of the group.
These nominees must be approved
by all the members of Pan-Hellenic
before their names are submitted
to the houses for vote.
Each sorority has one vote in the
election. The candidate receiving
the highest number of votes becomes
president for the following year,
while second and third votes arc
vice-president and secretary, re
spectively. Any ties which can be
decided by house balloting are re
ferred back to the houses. Other
wise the members of Pan-Hellenic
settle the election.
In the third and final election next
Monday night between Miss Daugh
erty and Miss Wilson, the candidate
receiving the higher number of votes
will be president and the other will
hold the office of vice-president. In
event of a possible tie, the decision
will be made by the present Pan-
Hellenic members.
