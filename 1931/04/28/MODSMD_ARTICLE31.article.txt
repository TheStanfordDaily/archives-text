The appearance ol' flic second issue of the much
discussed ('allege Forum, monthly magazine published
iff-campus by Gimnar Norberg, Stanford senior, may con
vince a great many doubting Thomases that the official
sanction of Ihe University heads is not tlie only key to
success.
Financial support of the University was denied the
('.allege Forum, after its editor had been led to believe that
that support would lie forthcoming. With predictions of
failure ringing in his ears, the editor produced the first
issue late last quarter, and found seven out of ten persons
willing to wager that the magazine would go oil the finan
cial rocks before the second number could make its ap
pearance.
The publication of Ihe magazine today is in Ihe nature
of a personal triumph for its editors, entirely apart from
the fact that its contents are well worth perusal.
