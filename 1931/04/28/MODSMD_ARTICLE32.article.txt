In the face of adverse criticism at the hands of indig
nant Victorians, The Daily today maintains its stand in
support of birth control, reassured by the fact that the
general assembly of the Presbyterian Church has seen the
light and swung its support to this publication.
In a report prepared for submission to the assembly, a
special report declares that "economic conditions make it
wrong to bring children into the world without adequate
provision for their nurture." If that doesn't stand squarely
behind The Daily, what does?
