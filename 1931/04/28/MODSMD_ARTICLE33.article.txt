# A 						BARGAIN
## 
### 
Stanford students who feel oppressed by the high cost
of collegiate education will be moved by the inexpensive
education sold by Berea College, in Kentucky. Berea
claims to offer iis students more education for less money
than any other American college. And an examination of
costs at Berea leads one to believe this assertion.
At Stanford, we pay for tuition $99 a quarter, three
times a year; or if we entered more recently, it costs us
$11-1 a quarter. That is $297, or $342 a year. The total
charge for a year of education at Berea College is $146 —
for the entire year. And that $1 Hi includes books and syl
labus fees, laboratory charges, and registration fees.
The charges for room rent show a comparable differ
ence. A room in Boble now costs $30 a quarter; next fall
il will cost $15 a quarter. The majority of the 40-year-old
Encina rooms cost $18 or $21 a quarter; in Toyon and
Brainier the cost varies from $21 to $30 a quarter. But at
this charming college of Berea, a neatly furnished room,
costs (if) cents a week ($7.80 in Stanford money for a 12-
week quarter), including hot water, never found in Encina
rooms, and electricity. And this 05 cents includes linen,
which is not included in the Stanford charges.
Encina Commons charges $85 a quarter for board, and
doesn't serve Saturday meals. A representative fraternity
bouse here charges $32 a month board. But at Berea stu
dent meals cost an average of 11 cents. That's $27.72 for
a 12-week quarter, with three meals every day.
Yes, it's ditlicult to resist the conviction that students at
Berea are getting a bargain!
