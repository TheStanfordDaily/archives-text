There have been three ghastly
murders in San Diego. The people
are pressing the police department
for a solution. If 4he police cannot
find the murderer, it is a safe
prophecy that they will blame the
dastardly deeds on the communists.
Why not? The "communists" are
always doing everything. It is they
who are the cause of the depression;
it is they whu cause strikes; it is
Ihey who are financing Sandino in
his American-killing exploits.

About the only thing of import
ance lately that has not been
blamed oVi the communists is the
pending divorce of Jack Dempsey,
and if would not be surprising in
the least if a communist, subsidized
by Soviet Russia preferably, v/as
named co-respondent when the case
comes to trial; and as yet no one
has placed full blame for the Nica
raguan earthquake on communistic
activities although there is strong
feeling in some quarters lhat the
reds were at least a contributing
factor in the terrible catastrophe.

Now we do not. believe in that
theory that claims 50-50 all around;
and in all sincerity, we are not un
dercover agents for the Third Inter
nationale although with an "of P
on the end of our name and given a
set of bushy red whiskers, v/e might
pass for one of the "comrades" with
little difficulty. We do, however,
feel that even that terrible thing—
communism, that causes some peo
ple to bite their nails just to hear
Ihe word —should be viewed with
fairness.
There are some people in the
United States, of whom the DA.R.
and Representative Fish are out
standing examples, who feel that
these terrible people—the "reds"—•

are threatening tlie government of
the great and powerful United
States. Consequently these persons
seem to have dedicated their lives to
ridding the U.S. of the communists
and make this nation safe for demo
cracy. Just to mention communist
and U.S. in the same breath is al
most. to utter a self-evident contra
diction.
There is no doubt that there are
a few hungry communists running
over this country—trying to get a
little publicity when mayors lacking
the sense of humor of the late Mayor
Rolph throw riot squads at their
parades and meetings. That there is
any danger of this handful over
throwing the great and mighty gov
ernment of this nation is hardly
conceivable. We in America still be
lieve in the old "up-the-ladder"
idea too strongly to risk our chances
at becoming rich for the masses.
Even the masses in this country
don't want to be masses. They all
believe in the story of the messen
ger boy that became bank president.
We in America don't like equality.
Everybody wants to pass his neigh
bor in the latest model of the most
expensive automobile. As long as
this is the case, all is safe (as far as
communism is concerned).

For u national organization like
♦ho Daughters of the American
Revolution to conduct a campaign
to save the nation from the gory
clutches of the scheming "reds"; for
the Congress of the United Stales
io authorize Hamilton Fish to con
duct a national investigation into
this terrible red menace—such ac
tivities are both humorous and dis
graceful. Humorous in that some
people take them seriously and dis
graceful in that they should be con
duced. ■—Abe Mellinkoff.
