THE WEIGHER OF SOULS. By
Andre Maurois. D. Appleton and
Company. 1931. At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.
The Weigher of Souls brings Mau
rois back to an admiring public,
after a prolonged lapse into the
duller and unsuitable field of biog
raphy, with a short and gripping
novel in the pleasant style of the
novel which first won him his repu
tation, The Silence of Colonel Bram
ble.
The story deals with the success
ful attempt of an English physician
to isolate the essence of life which
escapes from the human body on
death. Although it is a fantastic tale
it has sufficient scientific details to
make it extremely realistic.
As in his first novel, Maurois
shows the ability of portraying the
peculiarities and spirit of both the
French and the English which gave
"Colonel Bramble" its great popu
larity.
This is the sort of book that can
be read at a sitting and browsed
over for years. The authors bio
graphies were excellent of their kind
but he is far more at home with
this type of thing and one almost
senses in reading that Maurois felt
a sense of relief when he wrote it.

THEATRE STREET—By Tamata
Karsavina. E. P. DiiUon. 1930. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
The biographies of actors, those
momentarily brilliant individuals
whose brilliance lies in their 11 it
tings back and forth before rows of
apt to be extremely stupid. Among
the few exceptions are Arliss'
charmingly written "Up the Years
blazing globes and fallen faces, are

I from Bloomsbury" and Mr. Barry
j more's hilarious "Confessions," each
of which you will enjoy whether you
! care for the respective slobberings
; and rantings of the gentlemen in
| question or no.
There are other biographies of
| stage celebrities which hold the in
l terest of him who reads for reading's
| sake, simply because they are strings
i of episodes in the lives of individuals
I who are different from the mass of
j mankind.
I This autobiographical pleasantry
j seems to be of the latter type: in
j teresting if you have energy enough
l to read it. We spent very little time
i with M. Karsavina's struggles a la
| Oliver Optic: from crust to crown.

THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL—By
| dimming Pollock. Sapiucl French,
i' 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
The Rev. Channing Pollock again
! delivers a sermon in which the
j meek are victorious, the wicked ever
unhappy. His "House Beautiful" is
! a glorification of one of Edgar
j Guest's better-known poems: that
I one which pathetically announces
| that it takes a heap o' livin' to make
! a house a home.
This is one of those plays which
i should never have been printed for
| in present form it impresses chiefly
I as being a hodge podge of senti
| mental slop hovering uncertainly
; between the '90's, the present, and
i the days of chivalry.
It is the sort of thing which, when
j sneered at by jeunesse moderne,
! biings forth the ever-inspiring cries
I of "Youth, ah Youth . . . . et cetera."
—J.S.S.
