Heigh?ho! Today's paper may or [
may not contain Version Two of Lhe i
latest indoor sport, entitled "Pan- |
ning Hell out of Pan-Hell." This j
tripe is ground out a little too early j
to get the latest l-eturns, but we'd j
like to call your attention to it, j
anyway.
The rushing season having closed,
it is now open season on formal ini
tiations for the sororities. But, chil- j
dren, children, is there no place to i
go after a formal banquet except a !
Paly movie? The cute little young- j
ster who takes the tickets at the j
door fainted dead away when the j
avalanche of evening gowns swept j
down upon him.
The latest in Roble pets is a white

rat, which reposes in a cage under
a bed. Some burglar -is in for the
surprise of his life one of these
nights, and so, probably, is the rat.
There may be some connection,
and then again there may be none,
but the circus will be in town to
night. On Saturday Downcast Dean
Cromwell is bringing to this neigh
bodhood a troupe of trained—er —
athletes from our friendly rival uni
versity, Southern California. The
circus attractions will be in cages,
however.
As usual, one gathers that the
entire U.S.C. contingent will be
shipped up here on stretchers, but
come Saturday afternoon and there
won't be a crutch in the crowd.
