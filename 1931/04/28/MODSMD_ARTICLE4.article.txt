port!
A London paper recently tar
ried an advertisement signed
by a prominent, and ultra ex
clusive girls' sehool, stating the
institution was prepared to give
a liberal discount to a girl ten
nis player capable of represent
ing the school in junior open
tennis events.
Recent increase in attention
paid to sports by the British
schools is credited with a wave
of proselyting athletes, but
this is one of the rare examples
of advertising for them.
