## Cast Chosen For Murder Plot To Be Used By English Club 
### 
Complete plans were announced
yesterday by the English Club con
cerning the motion picture it will
produce and exhibit this quarter.
Filming will begin this week on
the renowned short story by Robert
Louis Stevenson, "Markheim." I
Grove Day and James Lyons will j
take the leads, Victor Ricketts will
be general manager of the under
taking, and Bill Palmer will super
vise the filming.
Story About Murder
The story of a murder in an an- I
tique shop, and the after sensations !
of the murderer, will be filmed in (
either one or two reels. A special, I
expensive film will be used to show j
to best advantage the unusual light- j
ing effects and the facial expres- \
sions of the actors.
The sets will be constructed on |
the campus by members of the Eng- j
lish Club, and the story by Steven- j
son will be adapted to the screen !
by students. Work on the scenario
has now been virtually completed.
Grove Day in Lead
Day, taking the lead as Mark
heim, and Lyons, portraying the
role of the owner of the antique
shop, have had sufficient stage ex.-
perience to fill their parts ably. The
other parts have not as yet been '
cast.
"We will try to approach as nearly 1
as possible to what a true silent pic- !
ture should be, as contrasted to the I
merely entertaining talkies. Wo will
try to use the motion picture camera j
to tell a story, almost entirely with- j
out subtitles. As a painter uses '
paint to create an artistic effect, so 1
we hope to use the camera to create J
a piece of artistry. The advent of j
the sound movies gives amateurs a
clear field in developing the art of
pantomime to perfection," Palmer
I said.
