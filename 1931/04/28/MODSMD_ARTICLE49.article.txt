MORE MYSTERY STUFF
Mister Dean Bartlett Cromwell,
head track and field coach of the
University of Southern California,
has been grossly accused, from time
to time during the present season,
of keeping certain details concern
ing lhe potentialities of his athletes
hidden from the track-loving pub
lic. Not long ago it was reported that
Mr. Cromwell became somewnat
vexed over the fact that his "dark
horse" two-miler, Earl Callahan, was
uncovered by a writer of the Los
Angeles Times.
This animosity between the
Trojan coach and the Southern
scribes, judging from the latest
developments, seems to he all
patched up, honey and roses
again. In fact it begins to look
as though Mr. Cromwell and
said scribes have effected some
sort of an alliance, the object of
which is to conspire against
Dink Templeton and the rest of
the "Reds" supporting the Car
dinal cause.
Thursday morning sporting pages
'jf all Los Angeles papers ran stories
0 the effect that the big track and
leld merchant from the South in
ended to put his athletes through
1 set of tryouts Friday, in order to
iudge which of them would make
he trip North to do battle with Lhe
ndians. Yet in Saturday's L.A. sport
iheets there was not a word con
cerning the results of these tryouts.
With all this mystery shrouding
idivities of the Cardinal and Gold
rackmen, it's doubly hard for any
ne more than 500 miles away to
ceep "in the know." Most important
if revelations expected in the re
;ults of Troy's trails was that con
•erning U.S.C.'s broadjumping
trength. Howard Paul, the man who
jeat Arnie West in the dual meet
ast year, was to jump again for the
irst time since pre-season practice,
vhen he suffered a badly-torn leg
nuscle.
There is a striking parallel in
the cases of West and Paul. In
1930 they were the two leading
collegiate contenders in their
specialty. Paul leaped 2-1 feet
3 J /a inches to beat West in the
dual meet, but West reversed
the decision with a jump of 24
feet 1-Vh inches to win the
1.C.4-A. title. Both were seri
ously hurt in early-season prac
tice this year, neither has
jumped in a 1931 meet, and both
are in questionable shape for
(lie titanic struggle next Satur
day. No one knows for sure
whether these two will be bat
tling it out for first, or even if
either will place.
Should Paul be back in his old
irm, Troy's increased strength in
le pit could decide the meet,
rom well's Barber has been con
dered a cinch for first at some
ling over '24 feet, while until re
sntly Stanford was given a clear
aim to second and third in the
ersons of Butler, West, or Werder.
pencer Selby, a comparative un
nown, jumped over 23 feet in prac
ce down South last week, some
iing which has put the fans to re
insidering the broad jump. But we
ave an idea that West is in fetter
mpe than Paul. Plenty depends
pon the answer to that question.

Injuries are causing concern
in the camp of the Indian. Podge
Smith's reported "pulled" muscle
turned out to be only a "cramp,"'
which should not effect his per
formance Saturday. A1 Ray,
however, seems to be in pretty
bad shape with a strained arm.
Heretofore conceded a first in
the javelin on the basis of his
showing in early meets, Ray
may not even place Saturday.
