# STANFORD PITCHER MADE RECIPIENT OF BIG LEAGUE OFFER
## 
### 
Dan Johnson, sensational sopho- 1
more ace of the Cardinal pitching j
staff, has been made the recipient of l
several offers from professional j
clubs, according to an unofficial re- !
port. The New York Yankees and j
the Los Angeles team of the Pacific I
Coast League are among the or- i
ganizations considering Johnson,
who refuses to disclose the extent
of the offers or his plans in regard
to them.
The approaches of the league
teams followed close upon the suc
cess of the Indian hurler when he
led Stanford to its first series vic
tory over California since the days i
of Ernie Nevers. So far this season j
Johnson has seven victories and one
defeat to his credit, with an excel- j
lent chance of increasing his games i
won total to eight if he works in
the coming encounter with San
Francisco University.
Bill Essick, scout for the Yankees,
paid Johnson a visit during the last
game of the Big Series with Cali
fornia, and apparently advised him
to finish college before signing with
any organization. Any agreement j
made by Johnson with professional !
teams would jeopardize his college j
career, as there are strict rules cov- j
ering the case.
