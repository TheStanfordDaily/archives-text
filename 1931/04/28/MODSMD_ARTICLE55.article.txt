# R.O.T.C. LOSES FIFTH HORSE THIS QUARTER
## 
### 
Collector, the R.O.T.C. horse which
caused the tragic death of Allan
Goodspeed in the fall of 1929 in a
polo game, was shot last week due
to a permanent condition of useless
ness. Following receipt of orders
from the East, Collector went to
horse paradise along with two other
disabled animals.
Thus the Army's supply of mounts
has decreased by five so far this
quarter. Conner was found dead in
his stall on April fool's day, and
Stockings fatally injured himself on
the Page Mill road April 11.
