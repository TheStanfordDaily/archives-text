# Les 						Hables Entirely Recovered from Illness
## SPRINT ACE WINS FAST 352 RAGE IN PRACTICE SESSION Injuries Affect DeGroot, Smith And Lombardi; Storms Leaves 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Les Hables, sprint star, whose ap
pendix has been caxising worry
among Farm track followers these
past few days, indicated yesterday
that he is rapidly returning to top
form in winning a 352-yard race in
37 flat, just half a second from his
own Stanford oval record.
Hables looked fine in this event.
He was running easily and finished
two or three yards ahead of his
closest rival, Ben Eastman. Trailing
Eastman a few feet were Maynor
Shove and Hec Dyer. The time is lhe
more encouraging for the fact that
the Stadium track was soft and
muddy yesterday.
DeGroot Has Sore Hand
Burt DeGroot was warming up
on the pole vault path, but still
complaining of a sore left hand. A1
Ray and Fred Zuger, a pair of im
portant men on the Indian field ros
ter, were both tossing the javelin
yesterday, although favoring in
juries. Ray's shoulder seems to be
in good shape again, but he is talk
ing things easy for the first part of
the week, as is Zuger, whose
sprained back is not yet quite right.
Both Ray and Zuger can be
counted on for around 195 feet, if
they are in trim against the Trojans
Saturday. Since Boeger has sudden
ly risen from the ranks of 175-foot
javelin throwers to a mark of 188
feet, chances seem excellent that
Templeton's trio will sweep the
event.
Lombardi Out of Practice
Captain Podge Smith took things
easy yesterday, forestalling the re
currence of a muscle cramp which
he suffered last Thursday. The ab
sence of Frank Lombardi, who is
afflicted with weak arches at pres
ent, was the only bad omen in yes
terday's turnout.
With Dyei-, Hables, and Lombardi
all running, Stanford has beyond
question the greatest collection of
sprint stars which any college can
boast. Each of these men is a con
sistent 9.8 century runner, and they
may be expected to finish in almost
any order in either that event or
the 220.
Alan Storms, little Stanford two
miler, has taken out a leave of ab
sence and will not be entered in the
Trojan meet. Storms' absence v/ill
rob the squad of one of its hopes
for the future.
