# TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE OPERATING
## Control Of Signals To Work Automatically 
### 
â– 
I Official operation of the traffic
controls at the intersection of El Ca
mino Real and Palm Drive is sched- I
uled to begin today. A traffic offi- j
| cer was at the post late yesterday i
j afternoon and the signals were in j
operation. It is understood that this !
. was merely an advance trial of the !
lights as they will eventually be!
I operated automatically.
The state highway commission has !
not yet given its sanction to either
the installation or the operation of
the new lights. The Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors grant
; ed its authority to operate them yes
terday morning on the application of
| representatives of the city of Palo
1 Alto and the University. The super
visors previously passed a resolu
tion permitting the erection of the
; signals without the formal sanction
of the highway commission.
Having received authority from
; the county, the city proceeded to
j install the four posts for the signals
I last week.
The controversy which delayed the
j installation of the lights centered
i partly around the city of Palo Alto's
exception to the state's requirement
that the lights be worked, not auto- |
matically, but by a properly depu- j
tized traffic officer, as in the case of j
the lights at the intersection of El:
Camino- Real and the entrance to!
| Redwood City.
