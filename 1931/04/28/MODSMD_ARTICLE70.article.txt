The invitation to give the San j
Francisco concert was extended to }
the orchestra by Chester W. Ro.se- I
kranz, executive director of Music j
â–  Week for the Civic Association, af- I
' t&r hearing a rehearsal of the cam- i
pus group. 1
i Music Week Founder
Rosekranz was himself the found- j
i er of Music Week and the practice ]
| has since spread throughout the !
| whole United States and is observed !
by 3400 leading cities. President '
; Hoover is honorary chairman of the
week, which will extend this year
from May 3 to 10.
"Interest in things musical is real- '
( ly keen at Stanford," according to j
Ralph Brown, publicity manager for 1
I the orchestra. "There has been an |
; unfortunate tendency to think of the |
! University merely as famous for its j
| school of medicine or for its law |
department. We believe this oppor- j
I tunity of showing over 5000 people |
what an orchestra composed, man- j
aged, and conducted entirely by stu- 1
j dents can do is a noteworthy one." I
