# MERELY CHATTING TO GIRLS REASON FOR CIRCUS FINE
## 
### 
| CIRCUS LIFE is full of many
pitfalls. Every man in the
circus says so. From the red
coated usher to the trapeze
performer, all affirmed that life
011 the road was not all it
seemed. The rule is that any
circus mail caught talking to a
girl is fined $5. Acrobats, side
show barkers, and ticket takers
discreetly turn aside their
heads whenever a woman
| comes into view.
And that is not all. The sec
| ond time a man is found speak
ing to a woman on the circus
grounds, instead of another
fine, he is gently hut firmly
kicked out of the show.
Then Jo-Jo, the Albino, was
asked his opinion of the Rule
j of the Circus. Shaking his col
orless hair, rubbing the stubble
I on his chin, and squinting out
of his crossed pink eyes. Jo-Jo
answered, "Why, no one ain't
told me of no secli rule."
