Audiences have never forgotten Wallace Beery as "Butch"
in "The Big House." Now he's delighting his public again in
the role of "Slaughterhouse." You'll like him better than
ever! This picture in addition to having the star of "The
Big House" was directed by the same director, George Hill,
and written by the same author, Frances Marion. No wonder
it's great!
