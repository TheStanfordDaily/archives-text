# ITALY, FRANCE MAY ABANDON NAVAL TREATY
## Briand Sees Difficulties In Pathway of Complete Marine Concord BARRIERS HALT PACT Seeks English Agreement For Submarines 
### 
PARIS, April 28. (A 3 )— Difficulty
in arriving at an agreement on the
exact meeting of the Italo-French
naval limitation treaty, today led to
an unofficial proposal from quarters
close to the Ministry of Marine that
France drop the treaty with Italy
and each country make informal
unilateral statements as to her naval
needs.
France would declare for a navy
of (>40,000 tons under the suggestion,
all units being replaced upon reach
ing the age limit. An annual con
struction program of approximately
40,000 tons would be necessary until
all superannuated ships are replaced.

Foreign Minister Aristide Briand's
outline of difficulties of the Italo-
French treaty before the council of
ministers this morning is considered
to have left the way more widely
open for this proposal.
After today's lengthy meeting of
the council, Premier Pierre Laval
said naval experts were still study
ing Great Britain's reply to France's
recent naval proposals. The counter
proposals embodied in London's note
have not been made public and
Italy's answer is not* expected for a
few days.

The proposal for a unilateral
statement argued that this would
not disturb the London Naval Treaty
as it would follow closely the con
struction and replacement allowed
under the terms for the first years
of the Franco-Italian agreement.
A simultaneous understanding
with England regarding the number
of submarines and the size of guns I
also would be considered desirable.
This is the first time since the
London Naval Conference that there
has been open talk of France ceasing
efforts for an understanding with
Italy on the subject.
