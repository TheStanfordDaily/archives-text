# PIANIST TALKS ON OLD MUSIC
## Interesting Program Given In Little Theatre 
### 
"The change to instrumental from
vocal music was a hard path to fol
low," said Elio Gianturco of the
University of California, who en
tertained an appreciative audience
in the Little Theatre last night with
piano selections from the works of
sixteenth century Italian musicians.
'"They had no models except vo
cal and dance music," he added.
Gerolamo Frescobaldi was one of
the greatest composers of the pe
riod, according to the lecturer, al
though it was rather late before
he became known. Frescobaldi's
Prelude and Fugue in A minor,
which Gianturco played with a
great deal of expression and feel
ing, was especially well-received by
the audience. The works of this
composer are very emotional. Clau
dio Merulo, a very different type of
artist from Frescobaldi, was one of
the most interesting masters of the
sixteenth century, according to Gi
anturco.
In a Toccata of Michelangelo Ros
si, the speaker pointed out the tor
ment and torture expressed in the
piece, and the architectural struc
ture of it, explaining that it is hard
to believe Rossi is a contemporary
of Frescobaldi.

Other compositions which were
particularly appreciated by the au
dience were the balletto "Count Or
lando" by Simone Molinaro, who
was one of the most popular musi
cal writers of his time; "Villanella"
the transcription of a vocal piece,
by an unknown composer, and "Ital
iana" whose author is also unknown.
Among the numbers was "Gagliar
da" by Vincenzio Galileo, father of
the astronomer Galileo.
