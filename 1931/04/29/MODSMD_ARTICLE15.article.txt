# BASEBALL, GOLF MADE OFFICIAL W.A.A. SPORTS
## Fencing, Riding Also Placed On Point-Winning Basis; Board Meets Later 
### 
Baseball was made an official
W.A.A. sport with provision for
awarding points under the present
system at the regular meeting of the
Women's Athletic Association Board
last night in the new Roble Gymna
sium. Golf, fencing, and riding were
also added to the list of sports re
ceiving points.
Points for baseball will be award
ed to members of the upper- and
lower-division teams. Each team
player will receive 100 points, while
members of the all-star team, who
will be determined by the coach
and manager, will gain additional
points.
Thomas Heads Group
Margery Thomas was appointed
by Gertrude Laidlaw, president of
the association, to investigate the
possibilities of a women's golf team.
If such a team is organized, points
will be awarded under the regular
team system.
Riding points will be awarded on
the basis of hours, while fencing
teams will be composed of the fol
lowing: all-star, two members, first
and second teams and squad, five
members each.
Money was voted from the W.A.A.
funds for the purpose of buying all
equipment for baseball, due to the
fact that there are insufficient funds
in the physical education depart
ment to make the necessary pur
chases. Katharine Sobey, manager
of baseball, was put in charge of
buying the diamond equipment.
Open Swimming Hours
Another meeting of the board will
be held next Tuesday night to ap
prove the report of the nominating
committee for next year's officers.
Members of the committee are Ger
trude Laidlaw, Mary Edith Jones,
Louise Hewlett, Margaret Ball, and
Elisabeth Larsh.
Other business for the next meet
ing include discussion of open hours
for swimming in the new Roble
pool on Sundays, and the report on
the Athletic Conference of Ameri
can College Women, held recently
at the University of Nevada.
Members of the board were en
tertained at supper in the lounge
of the new gymnasium by Miss Ger
trude Hawley, preceding the meet
ing last night.
