Back in l!)2t) the Stanford Literary
magazine, died an inglorious death.
: For a year it had been suffering fi-
I nancial difficulties and there seemed
1 to be no editor to succeed the re-
J tiring one .
A year later a new magazine, The
: Cardinal, was tentatively approved
by Ex Committee, but sufficient
j support was not forthcoming and
| the project was of necessity aban
doned.
And now, when all prospects of
j nurturing a literary and discussion
, magazine on this campus had been
| relegated to the impossible, comes
' the announcement of the publication
i of the SECOND issue of the "Col-
I lege Forum." Gunnar Norberg has
accomplished the impossible, and he
j has done it without the official sup
! port and sanction with which the
earlier magazines could not achieve
! success.
A former member of the "Lit"
Staff, an outstanding reviewer on
the Daily staff for several years,
j Norberg determined to see a new
; and successful magazine established.
Attending classes, and holding down
an outside job at the same time, he
yet found time to enlist the support
j of a group of Stanford students,
[ alumni, and younger members of
j the faculty, to take his plans ve-
I loed by the administration off the

campus, and to procure sufficient
advertising to publish bis first issue
in San Francisco last month.
Acclaimed a remarkable achieve
ment by interested groups on va
rious campi around the bay, "Col
lege Forum" appears this month
I with contributions from Mills Col-
I lege, California, Santa Clara, Col
j lege of the Pacific, Saint Mary's,
I and the University of San Francisco
j in addition to those of Stanford en
i thusiasts. Next month articles from
; U.C.L.A. and Southern California
j are scheduled to appear in its pages.
The need for a magazine to deal
| exclusively with campus projects
and problems has l6ng been felt, and
i it is the object, of the "College Fo
| rum" to provide a medium for those
writers who have something of note
to say concerning college questions.
"Its policy is to have only college
students as contributors, as far as
possible. Those among its contribu
tors who are not at present in col
leges or universities are very recent
j graduates—graduates within the last
! year or two," said Norberg in his
! editorial this month.
However, several novelists of
prominence on the coast will con
i tribute special articles of interest to
I college readers in subsequent is
sues. Among these are Kathleen
| Norris, Charles Caldwell Dobie, and
Gertrude Atherton.
