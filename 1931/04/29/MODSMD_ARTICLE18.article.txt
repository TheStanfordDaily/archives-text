attractions are an egg and spoon
race, a balloon race, and a plunging
contest with a definite time limit.
Friday night the Pavilion is to be
turned into a Spanish garden in
which merrymakers will dance to
music provided by Harold Howard
and his "Aristocrats." This orches

the West Coast and its personnel is
made up entirely of college students.
It has. been secured in place of
Owen Fallon's, whose contract has
been cancelled. There are a few
bids remaining which may be pur
chased at the A.S.S.U. offices in the
Old Union.
