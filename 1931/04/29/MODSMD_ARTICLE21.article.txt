## 
### 
RENO, Nov., April 28. (P.I.P.)—
Discontinuance of The Desert Wolf,
humor magazine of the University
of Nevada has been recommended
by the executive committee of the
associated students of that univer
sity.
The action of the executive com
mittee was based on the opinion that
The Desert Wolf was not giving full
value for the money invested in it.
It was claimed that the publication
is a drain on local people because
it is supported mainly by local ad
vertising. That only 10 students put
in efforts to publish the magazine
was also given as a reason for dis
continuance.
The committee's decision comes as
the result of a serious controversy
on the Nevada campus over the
worth of the magazine. Some
claimed that the money spent on it
could be put to better use in debat
ing or dramatics, although coaches
for both these activities expressed
themselves against advancing their
interests at the expense of some
other activity. Some students ob
jected to the important place given
to literary work in the publication.
Business men of Reno expressed
themselves in favor of The Desert
Wolf, saying that a college without
a humor magazine is like a second
rate junior college.
