# DEBATE TOPICS ON FREE TRADE
## Mellinkoff, Bloom To Side Against St. Mary's 
### 
The controversial subject of free
trade versus the protective tariff was
debated once again by Stanford
speakers last night, when Leonard
Bloom and Abe Mellinkoff jour
neyed to Moraga to take the nega
tive for the Cardinal forensic squad
in a non-decision argument against
the representatives of St. Mary's
College.
The question, "Resolved, That the
nations should adopt a policy of free
trade,'' has been debated before by
both Bloom and Mellinkoff. Mellin
koff was a member of the Southern
California tour of the forensic squad
during the last spring vacation, and
he has participated in contests with
almost a dozen colleges. Bloom
joined the varsity squad with an
impressive record on the frosh
squad, and was selected by Coach
J. G. Emerson to take part in the
important Joffre Medal debate last
week, but was forced to withdraw
because of illness.
Assistant Coach Leland Chapin
helped train the speakers, and ac
companied them on their trip across
the bay. Admission to the contest
was free.
The prohibition question will be
debated next by the Card squad. A
debate, on a phase of this subject
yet to be selected, has been sched
uled for May 15 against the Ameri
can Bankers' Association, San Fran
cisco Branch, according to Debate
Manager John Pascoe.
