The way was cleared today for

Harry R. Heneatie of Dartmouth
and Edward A. McLaughlin, presi
dent of Boston College, attended a
luncheon tendered by William J.
Bingham, director of Harvard ath
letics, and reached an amicable
agreement over their conflicting
games. It was McLaughlin's protest
to Mayor Curley which prompted
that official to announce he would
not sanction the interseetional clash
because it conflicted with the annual
Boston-Holy Cross College game.
After the luncheon McLaughlin
visited Mayor Curley and told him
it would be for the best interests of
the colleges concerned if he recon
sidered his decision of April 10. The
Boston College official said that he
had been assured that those re
sponsible for the scheduling of the
Dartmouth-Stanford game would
have selected another date if they
realized it would conflict with the
annual clash with the Massachusetts
Jesuit College team.
The mayor notified Bingham he
would gladly issue Harvard a per
mit to loan its athletic plant to Dart
mouth. ;
Upon learning of the move to open
the Harvard Stadium for the inter
seetional game, Professor William B.
Owens, president of the Pacific Coast
Conference, stated: "It is gratifying
to know that the series of games
planned with Dartmouth University
will be played as scheduled. Boston
College's generosity in offering the
stadium is very much appreciated."'
