PHILADELPHIA, April 28. (/P)â€”
Labor's national committee for
modification of the Volstead Act to
day adopted the report of its promo
tion committee urging the confer
ence to "take to the far corners of
our country the battle-cry of free
dom from an impossible govern
mental tyranny."
"Your committee urges," says the
report, "not any particular activity
toward the achievement of that no
ble end, but every possible lawful,
legitimate, and ethical activity to
ward the achievement of that end."
