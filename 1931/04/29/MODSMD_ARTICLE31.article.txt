# LEGISLATIVE ASININITY

### 
What cm) 1)0 characterized as absolutely Hie lasl word
in pettifogging, narrow-inin<led, and asinine legislation was
presented to the (California slate legislature last week by
seven assemblymen in the form of a resolution seeking
suppression of editorials in The Daili/ Californium which
criticize the proposed Sacramento and Fresno four-year
college measure.

The seven assemblymen have certainly made a pitiful
gesture in an effort to escape the flood of righteous indig
nation which the proposed "pork barrel" college bill
brought down upon the heads of its proponents.
Of all the papers in the state that criticized the measure,
(and there were few that did not) The l)uil\j Californian
is chosen l>v these seven immortals as the object of their
attack. The whole thing is preposterous. Why not a reso
lution seeking the suppression of like editorials in every
San Francisco paper? Because the college paper is theo
retically subject to faculty supervision, and the simple
seven thought that the editors might cringe before the
hoped-for rebuke.

At lasl reports, the resolution was still before Hie com
mittee 011 universities, to which it had been referred im
mediately. Whatever that group may do about it, how
ever, it is fairly certain that President Robert (i. Sproul of
the I Diversity of California will not allow his institution
to be used as a straw man for politicians to set up and
then knock down.
