### 
Nine days have gone by since its lirsl election this quar
ter was held, and still Pan-Hellenic has no president. Two
elections have been held, and another is scheduled for next
Monday. Pan-Hellenic is running true to form, having a
grand time doing nothing, and doing it badlv.
Formerly the Pan-Hellenic presidency rotated year bv
year among the HI sororities. This system was far from
satisfactory, incompetent officers frequently gaining the
posts. The new system, fraught as it is with complications
and delay, seems little better. A nominating committee se
lects three candidates for the presidency, and each house
votes 011 these three, sending its vote to the Pan-Hellenic
leaders. The candidate receiving the most votes is to be
president, the one next in line to be vice-president, and
the third one to be secretary.
After two elections, Pan-Hellenic has succeeded in
choosing a secretary. Next Monday, if all goes well, a presi
dent will be elected. However, the 10 sororities may pos
sibly reach a deadlock again with a tie vote, and then
more elections will be required.
Anyway, it's a system, and what's one election more or
less?
