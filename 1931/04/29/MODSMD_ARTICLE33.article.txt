The latesl chapter in the commercialization of the great
American autumnal industry was written last week when
municipal authority was called upon to insure a profitable
football show next fall between Hoston College and Holv
Cross. Mayor Curlev's action in refusing a license permit
ling the Dartmouth and Stanford football teams to play
in the Soldiers Field Stadium on November 28 is not only
a wholly unreasonable interference with the athletic func
tions of several institutions but an extremely dangerous
precedent for the future.
t'ndoubtediy the blame musl be laid at the door of the
Boston College Athletic Association, although Director
John I'. Curlev has attempted to pass the onus on to the
shoulders of the Hoston College Alumni Association. 11 is
also true that some criticism might be made of the Dart
mouth and Stanford ollieials for seeking the Stadium for
their game. The desire to hold the contest in Cambridge
does not arise purely from a desire to satisfy graduates.
The small sealing capacity of the stands at Hanover un
doubtedly bears considerable weight.
Bill Dartmouth, while it does not influence as many lo
cal votes as do perhaps Hoston College followers, is not
without close ties to Hoston. The Hub, as the geographical
and traditional center of New Kngland, must play a part
as foster parent to the Cranite state college. It is not wholly
unnatural that Dartmouth should pi ay a home football
game here.
Cranling that the mayor's action will bring perhaps
">,OOO additional cash customers to the Kagle-Crusader
meeting, the added gate receipts will be dearly bought.
The position of Hoston College in the intercollegiate world
will be seriously weakened from the wooded hills of Han
over lo the sunny shores of California. It will be known
as the first college which has sought a protective tariff for
its golden goose of the gridiron. It is not yet too late for
the college on the heights lo retire in comparatively good
grace by urging Hoston's mayor to reconsider*his ill-ad
vised veto. Thr Harvard Crimson.
