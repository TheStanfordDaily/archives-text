# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Queen Marie started it and every
body has been doing it ever since.
Some years ago, the clever queen
of Roumania made a trip to the re
public of the United States; she
caused quite a furor, to be sure. It
is reported that Coolidge almost
called the Senate into special ses
sion to decide what was the proper
manner for a President of a demo
cracy to greet tho Ruler of a mon
archy without causing diplomatic
embarrassment. For political rea
sons, the President did not know
whether he should kiss the royal
hand; or how three times, shout
"long Jive the queen" lustily, or
simply shake hands in a dignified
•silent manner—the way President
Coolidge welcomed other notables.
That Coolidge finally treated
Marie like any other person is com
mendable; but that there was hesi
tation was regrettable to be sure.
Social America, however, went liter
ally crazy over the Queen. The top
layer of the upper crust fairly threw
itself at the feet of her highness.
Jefferson surely would have groaned
in abject despair had he seen his
modern disciples of democracy. Rut
this passed and was forgotten.
Good news must travel in Europe,
for recently (that is ever since
Marie arrived here)* this country has
been literally bombarded with all
kinds, nationalities, and degrees of
loyalty. They come every year in
droves—dukes, counts, princes, and

other species. And does America
welcome them? We treat each as
though he were Lindbergh, Einstein,
and Mary Pickford all wrapped into
one. Debs and sub-debs fill the :
papers with willing testimonials on
how this or that prince dances, and j
the rabble just "eat it up."
Now if some member of some j
royal family has achieved something 1
outstanding, it is befitting that we I
give him a royal welcome. If some J
king is actually the ruler of his na- j
tion, it is fitting that we give him
(he honor accorded our Presidents :
in Europe. But that the American j
people—or those that count socially I
—should almost trample on each |
other in a mad desire to associate |
with some meaningless appendage, j
whose sole claim to fame is that he I
has famous dead ancestors, is in
deed a sad commentary on our
democracy.
Democracy was something cher
ished in those golden days of the !
past that we all like to talk about, |
but now too many people view it j
as a necessary evil that is saddled |
on them and must be made the
best of. We do not think that there I
is any danger of the establishment I
of a monarchy in the U.S.—that is of |
course ridiculous to the limit. We I
are sure, however, tHat a vote on !
the establishment of nobility in thin]
nation would receive willing sup- I
port from those who think they !
would be noblemen,
