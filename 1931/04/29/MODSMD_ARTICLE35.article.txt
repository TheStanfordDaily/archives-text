## A 						LITTLE TOO ENTHUSIASTIC? 
### 
To Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that Stanford
should he vei'y proud of her newly
revised Honor Code. As a character
builder it is incomparable. Hie men
and women that henceforth graduate
from this institution will no doubt
he far superior to those loose-living
roughs of yesterday. One need hut
analyze this new System and the
way it functions to be fully con
vinced of its worth.
In the first place, signing one's
name twice on the blue book will no
doubt arouse one's conscience so
that the mere thought of cheating
will be horrifying.
In the second place, the slightest
conversation in class is evidence of
dishonorable conduct and will not
he tolerated. Nobody will dare ask
his neighbor a question. Of course,
he might go outside for a smoke and
talk a little, but that is perfectly
honorable.
In the third place, this remarkable
System encourages espionage, but
perhaps that shouldn't be frowned
upon. After all why should we trust
anybody in this harsh world? Dis
trust makes for peace and happiness.
And informers are always righteous.

I In the fourth place, any person
I accused is sure to have an honorable
and fail - trial. 1 believe the assump
j tion is that he is guilty until proved
I innocent. Of course, any defense
i that he might make is considered a
i great deal more than the circum
| stantial evidence against him. He
i may call in witnesses for defense,
j but usually he can get none. Un
fortunately, most people are too busy
j minding their own business to see
J the cheating around them.
I In the fifth place, the System
j works, and that is what counts. I
believe a student has been sus
| pended already for cheating. The
j Men's Council, goaded by a zealous
j press, surely "got its man." An ex
j ample was set. No one else will vio
, late the rules. Fear of punishment
has always been the preventer of
crime. It will not fail us here. The
: character of our students will surely
improve.
But perhaps I am a little too en
thusiastic. Maybe a good old-fash
ioned proctor system would be bet
ter. But I suppose that would be
too reactionary. We must progress.

To Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that Stanford
should he vei'y proud of her newly
revised Honor Code. As a character
builder it is incomparable. Hie men
and women that henceforth graduate
from this institution will no doubt
he far superior to those loose-living
roughs of yesterday. One need hut
analyze this new System and the
way it functions to be fully con
vinced of its worth.
In the first place, signing one's
name twice on the blue book will no
doubt arouse one's conscience so
that the mere thought of cheating
will be horrifying.
In the second place, the slightest
conversation in class is evidence of
dishonorable conduct and will not
he tolerated. Nobody will dare ask
his neighbor a question. Of course,
he might go outside for a smoke and
talk a little, but that is perfectly
honorable.
In the third place, this remarkable
System encourages espionage, but
perhaps that shouldn't be frowned
upon. After all why should we trust
anybody in this harsh world? Dis
trust makes for peace and happiness.
And informers are always righteous.

I In the fourth place, any person
I accused is sure to have an honorable
and fail - trial. 1 believe the assump
j tion is that he is guilty until proved
I innocent. Of course, any defense
i that he might make is considered a
i great deal more than the circum
| stantial evidence against him. He
i may call in witnesses for defense,
j but usually he can get none. Un
fortunately, most people are too busy
j minding their own business to see
J the cheating around them.
I In the fifth place, the System
j works, and that is what counts. I
believe a student has been sus
| pended already for cheating. The
j Men's Council, goaded by a zealous
j press, surely "got its man." An ex
j ample was set. No one else will vio
, late the rules. Fear of punishment
has always been the preventer of
crime. It will not fail us here. The
: character of our students will surely

But perhaps I am a little too en
thusiastic. Maybe a good old-fash
