HAMLET—At the Columbia Thea
tre, San Francisco.
After an opening scene in which
characters either piped or groaned
the familiar lines, William Thornton
entered and soon thereafter proved
himself worthy of commendation: a
very youthful and very convincing
Hamlet.
For some obscure'reason actors
who essay the role before they have
reaohed mild decay are patted and
considered slightly insincere, inade
quate as grapplers with the bard's
hefty passions. In spite of this tra
ditional critical nonsense Thornton
seemed to us more convincing than
an aged totterer and much more ap
propriate.
His supporting cast has a few
members who fill their assignment
gracefully, several who do not. Ruth
Neely's Ophelia was cute; the Ro
sencrantz and Guildenstern more
ludicrous than usual. Alfred Eld
ridge's Polonius, on the other hand,
was amusingly pompous, and Myron
Begg's Horatio deserved applause

| after (he first act had been passed.

CYRANO DE BERGERAC—At the
College of the Pacific.
Quite courageous and in some
ways foolhardy was the production
of Rostand's drama by the Pacific
Players last week: illness of De
Marcus Brown, their director, left
[ production almost entirely in the
! inexperienccdly capable hands of
j student. Harriet Smith.
Greydon Milam's Cyrano would
I have been more satisfying had he
been trained more in the tradition
of the last century. His quite Ameri
jcan tongue proved a little discon
| certing, however fine his acting was.
Brown's fine settings were well
lighted, the production technically
near perfection. The Players deserve
commendation but ought, for the
| present at least, to be satisfied with
' heavy plays of the "Granite" type
which have smaller casts to be filled.
The college is, by its size, limited in
i the production of large-cast drama
;to interesting adequacy. ■ —J.S.S.
