# NEW STOP SIGNALS PROVE SUCCESS IN FIRST DAY'S TRIAL

"The new stop lights at the foot
of Palm Drive proved themselves
completely successful in their first
day of official operation," said L. H.
Grieb, Palo Alto traffic sergeant, last
night.
A Daily reporter stationed on the
corner for an hour yesterday after
noon recorded that cars were
stopped for crossing against the
lights about every eight and a half
minutes. Most of the violators were
traveling between the campus and
Palo Alto.
No arrests were made yesterday
as the police think thai the public
should first become familiar with
the lights. At present the lights are
set so that the Palo Alto-Stanford
crossing is clear for 15 seconds, and
the highway crossing for 25 seconds.
Tests are still under way to deter
mine if these are the best intervals.
According to Grieb, a study last
week showed that practically as
many automobiles crossed between
Palo Alto and the campus, as along
the highway.
