l, Vic Williams is a good quarter
lies, and Ben Eastman will have
travel right along to beat him. But
the other hand, Williams wiil
ve to travel some to beat East
m." This is the sentiment of the
idents of San Jose High School, as
pressed by their correspondent in
2 columns of the Mercury Herald,
tat may provoke a laugh, but Dink
pie ton and Dean Cromwell
uld get together on the same sub T
•t and give you no better predic
n. A lot of "experts" have adopted
■ same attitude toward the same
*el, except that they present fig
es lo prove nothing at all.

The possibility of record
l»reuking performances always
nines in for a little gossip be
ore a meet so saturated with
alcnt as Saturday's classic en
■ountcr. While we're doing it we
night as well forget Stanford
•i.C. dual meet records and shoot
it something bigger, the all-time
records of these two track
alented institutions.

Though they haven't been of
icinlly compiled, these are Stan

.
loing down the list, the first
eat at record-breaking will be
•jr's attempt to better his own all
o mark of 9.6 in the century. In
ing to beat out Wykoff at his
t, Hec might cut a tenth of a
Dnd from this. The Cardinal 220
rk rests on the same conjecture,
ugh chances here are less.
•oth S.C. and Indian best times
the 440 are in danger, though
•ncer's 47.7 is a tough one to
ot at. Seeing Ben Eastman crack
o take Williams while he was
tiering the Trojan mark would
about satisfy all the "Reds"' in
stands. The Stanford mile, two
3, and high jump marks are safe,
he shelf to remain for some time
ither with the shot, discus, pole
li, and javelin records.
McCleagh has an outside
uince of breaking the Red and
old 880 time while chasing
astman to new heights in that
vent. The respective record
tiders for (lie low sticks. Podge
mitli and Ernie Payne, will be
Utling it out Saturday, so any
iing might happen. In the rc
y, much the same condition
ill exist, except that the va
mcy left in Templeton's world
■ating quartet of 1930 will
■ohahly be plugged by East
an. —Crawford
