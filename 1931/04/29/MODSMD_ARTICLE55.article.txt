# INDIAN BALL TEAM READY FOR FINAL GAME WITH S.F.U.
## Squad Is In Good Shape As Wolter Drives Team Hard For Battle 
### 
With the prospect of having the
entire team in good physical shape
for the last game of the season to be
played on Saturday in the local
park against San Francisco Univer
sity, Harry Wolter put the Stanford
baseball squad through a stiff work
out yesterday.

Particular attention was paid to
the smooth-working of the double
play combinations of short and sec
ond. Dykes Johnson seemed to have
his long peg from third over to first
in fine working order, snapping out
imaginary runners in great style.

Stealing second base against Stan
ford has been a fairly easy accom
plishment this season, but Art Miller
has indicated by his performances
in the last few games that this mali
cious practice is becoming more and
more dangerous. Miller was pegging
the ball down to second yesterday
with a good deal of effect.
Apparently rushing and rain have
not affected the batting eyes of the
Cards' heavy hitters. Knocking the
balls out to the edge of the bank
was a common performance in yes
terday's practice session.
The Trojans have crept up within
striking distance of the Redshirts in
their pennant aspirations by virtue
of the two victories over the Gaels
on the latter's Southern jaunt. Vic
tories over the Bruins are pretty
much a foregone conclusion for Sam
Barry's men, which would leave the
Trojans just one game behind the
league-leading Cards.
