## Amendment Would Permit Jury's Discretion 
### 
SACRAMENTO, April 28. (IP)
By a vote of 47-29 the opponents of
Assemblyman William Hornblower's
anti-hanging bill late today adopted
an amendment to the bill which de
feated the original purpose of the
' bill to abolish capital punishment.
The amendment by Assemblyman
!C. Ray Robinson would leave the
degree of punishment to the jury.
The Robinson amendment placed
; the anti-hanging bill back on file
, for action by the house with the
anti-hanging provision eliminated,
giving the jury three ways to dis
pose of murder cases. They are:
hanging, life imprisonment without
parole, and life imprisonment with
possibility of parole.
Throughout the debate of the bill
1 both proponents and the majority of
opponents had joined in urging the
i fullest discussion of the measure.
The Hornblower bill marked the first
j time in the state's history that a
proposal to abolish the death penalty
j had been deliberated in the Assem
bly. Similar bills have heretofore
died in committee.
