# BEN EASTMAN DOES 48.1 IN 440 RUN ON LOCAL OVAL AGAINST MAYNOR SHOVE
## 
### Lowell Cox 
With Shove thundering at his I
heels two yards behind, Ben East- j
man, Stanford's blond hope l'or a
victory over U.S.C. Saturday, yes
terday afternoon stopped the watch
es at 48.1 in a 440 heat.
Eastman's consistent performance
around the 48-second mark indicates
that it will be some race when he |
tangles with Vic Williams, Trojan
star who last year won the national
championship. That Dink's pet
sophomore is capable of getting un
der 48 flat if pushed no one will
deny, and his chances of beating i
Wiliams are better than even.
Williams' best official time this
season is 48.2, although Southern,
California partisans are looking for
him to crack 48 seconds any time.
The grapevine telegraph has it that
Williams did 47.7 in a recent practice
lap, but considering U.S.C. unoffi
cial time, the rumor may mean
something, and then again, it may
not.
Shove's startling performance yes
terday demonstrates that he is a lad
to be reckoned with Saturday. He ;
nosed out Les Hables by a comfort- j
able margin.
Hec Dyer again hit 9.8 in the con- j
tury, beating Cy Leland, his con- I
queror of last week. With Wykoff j
hitting f1.6, it is improbable that Dyer ;
will take the 100, although his ,
chances in the furlong are at least !
even.
Dyer took the shorter sprint last <
year, with the result that the Tro- |
jans set up a howl about the starter j
and insisted on a new one this year. |
After considerable bickering, it was |

! announced yesterday that Bob |
I Strehle, Pomona coach, will pop the 1
! gun Saturday.
With dopesters sprouting gray hair
and figuring the outcome of Satur- I
day's meet at anywhere between G7 i
to 64 in favor of Troy to 71 to 60
in favor of the Indians, it is con- |
ceded that much will depend on the I
performances of Stanford's cripples i
—and Ben Eastman.
Captain ' Podge*' Smith, Lombard!, 1
Les Hables, Ray, Zuger, and West '
ai*e all on the injured list. Smith, j
j counted on for eight points in the '
hurdles, says he l'cels "like a man |
with a wooden leg," and there is j
considerable danger that he will not I
, ° .
be up to par.
As for Ben Eastman, he can hard
ly be considered a cripple—hardly, j
Tcmpleton is again counting on him
for three races —449, 880, and relay
—and every one is important.
The writer ventures that the bo- ,
spectacled star will come through,
and if the injury ogre does not play j
too great havoc with Card hopes, a j
Stanford victory will be forthcom- :
,ing.
