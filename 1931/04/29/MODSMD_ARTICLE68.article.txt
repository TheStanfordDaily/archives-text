# SALINAS FACTORY EXTRACTS RUBBER FROM BRUSH HEAP
## 7½ Tons Converted Daily From Guayule, Semi-Desert Shrub 
### 
SALINAS, April 28. (/P) —Heaps
of brush are converted into a 200-
pound block of raw rubber in four
hours at a factory here. The daily
output is 15,000 pounds.
The raw material is guayule, a
semi-desert shrub found growing
wild in northern Mexico and south
western Texas, but domesticated in
the Salinas valley.
The finished product possesses the
same chemical content as that which
comes from the hevea trees of Su
matra and the ' British East Indies,
but the method of extraction is dif
ferent, with specially designed ma
chinery cutting down production
costs to meet the competition of
cheap labor in foreign lands.
Extraction Process
The method of growing and man
ufacture of rubber from guayule is
a combination of milling, mining,
hydraulic engineering, and laundry
operation.
The brush first undergoes a com
plete maceration. In the factory the
chopped shrub is mixed with water
and fed into long, tubular drums in
which are thousands of fine Hint
pebbles from the Danish coast.
The solution passes along the
tubes to complete the destruction of
the fiber, the rubber-like content
of the plant being separated from
the fibrous portion of the mixture.
The former is then run into a
larger vat, where it is beaten to the
proper consistency by rubber-cov
ered lead balls. It is next treated
under heat to remove all water and
finally compressed into 200-pound
blocks of rubber under hydraulic
pressure.
Harvest in Four Years
Guayule, pronounced wy-oe-ly,
can be harvested four years after
planting and can remain in the
ground for 10 years, with an in
creased rubber content each year.
The shrub contains from 14 to 19 per
cent rubber, depending upon age,
according to chemists employed by
the producing company.
The pxoducers have 6,000 acres
under cultivation here and plan to
harvest 2,000 acres of guayule an
nually, planting an equal amount
each year. George H. Carnahan,
president of the company, says there
is nothing new or mysterious about
guayule, and that it is in no sense a
synthetic rubber or a substitute. The
only new phase lies in the domesti
cation of the brush.

ground for 10 years, with an in
creased rubber content each year.
The shrub contains from 14 to 19 per
cent rubber, depending upon age,
according to chemists employed by
the producing company.
The pxoducers have 6,000 acres
under cultivation here and plan to
harvest 2,000 acres of guayule an
nually, planting an equal amount
each year. George H. Carnahan,
president of the company, says there
is nothing new or mysterious about
guayule, and that it is in no sense a
synthetic rubber or a substitute. The
only new phase lies in the domesti
cation of the brush.
SALINAS, April 28. (/P) —Heaps
of brush are converted into a 200-
pound block of raw rubber in four
hours at a factory here. The daily
output is 15,000 pounds.
The raw material is guayule, a
semi-desert shrub found growing
wild in northern Mexico and south
western Texas, but domesticated in
the Salinas valley.
The finished product possesses the
same chemical content as that which
comes from the hevea trees of Su
matra and the ' British East Indies,
but the method of extraction is dif
ferent, with specially designed ma
chinery cutting down production
costs to meet the competition of
cheap labor in foreign lands.
Extraction Process
The method of growing and man
ufacture of rubber from guayule is
a combination of milling, mining,
hydraulic engineering, and laundry
operation.
The brush first undergoes a com
plete maceration. In the factory the
chopped shrub is mixed with water
and fed into long, tubular drums in
which are thousands of fine Hint
pebbles from the Danish coast.
The solution passes along the
tubes to complete the destruction of
the fiber, the rubber-like content
of the plant being separated from
the fibrous portion of the mixture.
The former is then run into a
larger vat, where it is beaten to the
proper consistency by rubber-cov
ered lead balls. It is next treated
under heat to remove all water and
finally compressed into 200-pound
blocks of rubber under hydraulic
pressure.
Harvest in Four Years
Guayule, pronounced wy-oe-ly,
can be harvested four years after
planting and can remain in the
ground for 10 years, with an in
creased rubber content each year.
The shrub contains from 14 to 19 per
cent rubber, depending upon age,
