# NATION GREETS SIAM MONARCHS
## Royal Pair Entertained At White House Dinner 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 29. (/P) â€”
America's highest officials paused
today to pay their respects to the
first absolute monarch to visit the
Nation's capital. With an abundance
of ceremony counter-balanced by a
lack of pomp, the King and Queen
of Siam received welcome from all
leading officers of the Government,
and from diplomats from foreign
lands. The King and Queen arrived
last night. They began their day
with a formal call upon the Presi
dent and Mrs. Hoover.
It was immediately i*et.urned by
the chief executive and Mrs. Hoover,
in company with military and naval
aids and secret service men, at the
temporary royal residence, loaned
for the visit by Larz Anderson, for
mer American diplomat.
Twice the King and Queen, es
corted by their staff and flanked by
motoi'cycle police, made the trip to
the White House, the second time
to dine with the President and Mrs.
Hoover at a state dinner.
The carefully planned afternoon
program for the visitors was undone
by a few words from the King's
physician, who advised against fur
ther strain after the reception. The
King thereupon designated Prince
and Princess Svasti, his father-in
law and mother-in-law, to visit the
tomb of the unknown soldier, Fort
Myer, afid Mount Vernon in his
place.
Late in the afternoon the King
visited Drs. Sterling V. Mead, H. J.
Newton, and D. F. Lynch, specialists
in dental surgery. A member of the
household said the visit was solely
for an examination and diagnosis
and not for an extraction or special
work. The King was not accom
panied by the queen, who spent the
afternoon resting.
