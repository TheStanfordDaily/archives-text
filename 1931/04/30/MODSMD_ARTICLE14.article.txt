All Cardinals to the fore and show
1 how and why, convincingly, Dink
| Templeton's boys will leave U.S.C.
behind this Saturday. It's worth the

agreed to supply the canniest rough
J with a $10 pair of shoes, Roos Bros,
will give the next best dopester a
, sweater worth $5, and Wilson's of
fers a dollar box of candy.
Today at noon is the deadline lor
j dope sheets, with the winners in
every event forecast whethefr by
; necromancy, chance, or cold figuring
with Spaulding's score book. Then,
