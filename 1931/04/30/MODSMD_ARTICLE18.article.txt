# Golf Course One Of 15 Best In World-Morlay
## 
### MICHAEL CROFOOT 
Here is what. Dr. H. J. Morlan,
I famous travelling golfer, thinks:
that the Stanford course is one of
the three best on the entire Pacific
Coast, one of the 10 best in the
United States, and one of the 15
1 finest in the whole world.
And Dr. Morlan is eminently
i qualified to pass judgment.
Retiring from his profession as a
I Chicago physician 10 years ago, he
set out to golf the world, and at the
| present time there is not a single
outstanding golf course anywhere
i which he has not played over, in
' pursuit of his avocation Dr. Morland
has travelled through some 48 states,
1 55 countries, and 5 continents; he
has played 800 different links.
Adventures Published
He has written stories about his
1 adventures for five magazines, in-
I eluding the "American Golfer" and

"Golf Illustrated."
As a result of his pursuit he now
posseses a six handicap, an ac
quaintance with all the moguls of
the golfing realm, an inexhaustible
| fund of anecdotes, a decade of
pleasant memories, and his present
I fame. He hopes soon to write an
' article epitomizing his observations
on the 15 best golf courses in the
world.
Course's Good Points
"In this list Stanford will certain
i ly have a place," said he. "In beauty,
I contour, placing of hazards, and a
J dozen other things it is head and
I shoulders above most of the links I
have seen. There are two other coast
j courses, Cypress Point, and the Val
ley Club at Santa Barbara, to rival
! it. I believe that In a few m.>re
! years it will have a national and
I even international reputation."
