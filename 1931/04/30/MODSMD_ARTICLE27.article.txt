# MAYNOR SHOVE JOINS LIST OF FARM CRIPPLES
## Quarter-Miler Has Poison Oak; May Be Unable To Run Saturday FRANK LOMBARDI BACK Rintala Tosses Javelin 185 Feet; May Enter 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Ol' Man Trouble thrust his un
welcome nose into Dink Templeton's
track affairs at the Stadium yester
day with the information that May
i nor Shove, 440 star, is all puffed up
with a bad case of poison oak infec
tion.
Although Shove is expected to be
in running order by the time the
1440 starts with the Trojans Saturday,
his infection will surely cost him
the loss of two or three days of
valuable pre-meet training.
Shove Dependable
Shove's possible absence from the
Indian entry l list would be a sad
blow to Stanford's chances against
Dean Cromwell's strong S.C. outfit.
He is one of the most dependable
quarter-milers of 49 fiat that Stan
ford has ever boasted, and, in the
opinion of many, the "prettiest"
! runner on the present squad.
Rumor has it that Ben Eastman
will not run the 440 Saturday be
cause of a minor operation on one
of his toes Tuesday evening. How
ever, he showed no signs of any dis
ability in running a slow lap at
j practice yesterday.
Eastman Paces 440
Striving to negotiate the first lap
jof a half-mile run in 54 seconds,
! Eastman crossed the line in the close
time of 54.6. Should he stay out of
the quarter against Troy, it will be
i because of some point-winning
! scheme of Templeton's, rather than,
because of any ti'ouble with his feet,
i Frank Lombardi, who was kept
I out of practice sessions Monday and
Tuesday by weak arches, was pacing
j hundred-yard lengths on the grass
yesterday, and apparently as fast as
j ever.
Rintala May Enter
Rudy Rintala, after working only
| three days inside the Old Oval, has
J developed into a javelin tosser of
J some 185 or 190 feet. Whether Tem
< pleton will call on him Saturday is
j still unsettled, depending, no doubt,
| upon the condition of the conva
i lescing Fred Zuger and A1 Ray.
Coach Harry Wolter of the base
ball team has given Rintala his per
mission to compete in the meet, and
if either Ray or Zuger is not m
i shape, Rintala can be counted on to
team with the other and August
, Boeger to sweep the javelin from the
Red and Gold spearmen.
Fans in the Stadium yesterday
couldn't help exclaiming at the great
I form Jack Brugman was demon
strating in taking his workout over
1 the high hurdles. It would not great
ly surprise those who have watched
him improving this season to see.
Brugman crash through with a point
or so for the Indian winning margin
against Troy.
