# THE 						LIGHT AT LAST
## 
### 
Under pressure from l)olh Dartmouth and Boston Col
lege officials, the Hon. .lames M. Curlev, mayor of Boston,
has withdrawn his objections to having Stanford play
Dartmouth in that city on November 28, and has granted
I lie Indians and the Hanoverians the use of the Harvard
Stadium on that date.
Mayor Curlev's original refusal to permit the use of
the stadium was based on the fact that the Boston College
llolv Cross game, long a Boston iixlure, was scheduled for
the same date, and the mayor apparently feared a counter
attraction of the proportions of a Stanford-Dartmouth
battle. At all events, his right-about-face has cleared up an
awkward situation.
Just what were the real reasons behind the mayor's
first move is a trifle hard to judge at a distance of 3,000
miles, but the following excerpt from the editorial columns
of the Dartmouth, student daily, printed below, may throw
some light 011 the matter. The editorial, headed "The Cur
lev Worm Gets the Bird," said in part:
"The big cigars and diamond stickpins of politics have
at last wedged their way into the realm of intercollegiate
sport. The Honorable James M. Curley, fawning before
the Irish vote of Boston, withholds permission for the
Dartmouth-Stanford football game, scheduled for over
two years to be played in the Harvard Stadium. By way
of explanation, the mayor points out that the Holy Cross-
Boston College game, which is booked for the same after
noon, has been an affair of long standing on the chart of
Boston activities, and that these two colleges are entitled
'to the little revenue.'
". . . We object to Mr. Curlev's big business attitude
toward intercollegiate football. Is football, to Boston peo
ple, no more than a commercial venture?"
Such is the Dartmouth attitude. A similar one is ex
pressed by The Harvard C.rimson, although the latter di
rects its criticism more at the Boston College officials who
protested rather than at Mayor Curlew But the good mayor
has «een the Ii;_(111 at last, and the good people of the Hub
City will get their chance to see the Big Bed Team with the
white jerseys in action,
