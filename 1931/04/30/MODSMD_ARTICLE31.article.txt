# ACADEMIC GREED?

### 
Higher education, and capitalism, as symbolized bv
Yale's new $7,000,0(10 library, take an eloquent beating in
the current issue of The Nation. The structure is called,
"Not merely a library, of course, but Ihe largest building
in New Haven, the greatest monument in Connecticut, the
vastest library on the continent, Ihe greatest educational
spectacle in the world."
When the library was dedicated, The Nation declares,
"the assemblage was stunned by Ihe thirteenth-century
sanctity, Ihe gilt, and the glory. The monument will indeed
remain through the centuries as a memorial to the charac
ter of its builders. For ages it will unmercifully reveal their
soul."
Never having witnessed the spectacle of $7,000,000 be
ing spent 011 a single campus building, Stanford is still a
bit countrified so far as "capitalistic" higher education is
concerned. Despite the grandeur in schooling of which
Stanford has been accused, outward signs of it are not ap
parent here. We want money, all the money we can get,
to carry out the plans already drawn up for the develop
ment of existing departments and schools of the University.
So many are Stanford's needs that all obtainable funds
have to be spent meagrely and economically.
It does seem a little extravagant for Yale to have spent
$7,000,000 on a library building alone, although, in all prob
ability, the gift specified that it should be so spent. How
ever, at Stanford we'd like to have that $7,000,000, even
though it had to be used entirely for one building.
I be $/,000,000 may not have been too practically ex
pended. But is The Nation justified to brand all education,
and especially that found at Yale, as characterized by
academic greed? lias higher education then become noth
ing more than capitalistic materialism? What right has
The Nation to say of Yale students and all present day
college students, ". . . neither they nor their fellows will
ever learn a true thing in anv institution such as this"?
