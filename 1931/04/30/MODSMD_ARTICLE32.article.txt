The most outstanding factor asso
ciated with many countries is revo
lution—and.the most consistent fac
tor accompanying revolutions are
student uprisings. In Spain—in
Mexico—in the South American
countries, it is the student class that
has often started moves for more
liberal governments. It is the student
who takes a part in serious govern
mental affairs in these countries.
But in America collegians spend
their time on different matters. In
these other lands students cheer the
new government; we cheer the "big
orange team"—they set fire to ar
senals; we light up our bonfires—
they drink to the new social re
form; we drink just to be drinking.
Now we are not advocating that
Stanford students should swoop
down upon Palo Alto, sack the city
hall, take over the management of
the theatres and malted milk par
lors, and declare the triumph of the
proletariat. We do feel that it is a
just criticism on modern college
students that they take no interest
or active part in governmental af
fairs. College students are supposed
be the "cream of the land."
In the classroom we learn about
the fundamental social, economic,
religious, and political factors un
derlying modern governmental pro
cedure. We learn how the parties
operate. We learn and write care
fully in blue books concerning the
necessity for participation in public

| affairs by '"intelligent, informed peo
ple." But it doesn't seem to make
any actual difference in our activi
ties. With the U.S.C. track meet a
few days off, can anyone imagine
students gathering in excited circles
along the quad and discuss the pos
sibility of Hoover's re-election? The
state is fairly interested at the pres
ent time over an anti-capital pun
ishment bill. Does the campus know
; and much less care over the fate of
this measure?
The reason, or at least one of the
more noticeable reasons, for this
situation, is the lack of political
activity of the proper variety in stu
dent self-government. Politics is
something strange to the average
student; it is completely outside his
sphere like Mars or Jupiter. If coi-
I lege were a school for future politi
cal activity, perhaps, college students
during and after undergraduate days
would;become intelligent citizens. It'
> campaigns were conducted at Stan
ford, some candidates would attempt
to use unfounded ballyhoo. It is a
I slur, and perhaps a justified slur, on
I Stanford intelligence, to believe that
j students would be fooled by such
practices—meant for ignorant mass
j es. Students will have to face such
ballyhoo on a wholesale scare after
j graduation, and if they are to cope
I with it the way graduates of Euro
; pean universities do, they must be
j trained in uncovering and recogniz
, ing "political bunko" during campus
j life. —Abe Mellinkoff

senals; we light up our bonfires—
they drink to the new social re

Now we are not advocating that
Stanford students should swoop
down upon Palo Alto, sack the city
hall, take over the management of
the theatres and malted milk par
lors, and declare the triumph of the
proletariat. We do feel that it is a
just criticism on modern college
students that they take no interest
or active part in governmental af
fairs. College students are supposed
be the "cream of the land."
In the classroom we learn about
the fundamental social, economic,
religious, and political factors un
derlying modern governmental pro
cedure. We learn how the parties
operate. We learn and write care
fully in blue books concerning the
necessity for participation in public

| affairs by '"intelligent, informed peo
ple." But it doesn't seem to make
any actual difference in our activi
ties. With the U.S.C. track meet a
few days off, can anyone imagine
students gathering in excited circles
along the quad and discuss the pos
sibility of Hoover's re-election? The
state is fairly interested at the pres
ent time over an anti-capital pun
ishment bill. Does the campus know
; and much less care over the fate of
this measure?
The reason, or at least one of the
more noticeable reasons, for this
situation, is the lack of political
activity of the proper variety in stu
dent self-government. Politics is
something strange to the average
student; it is completely outside his
sphere like Mars or Jupiter. If coi-
I lege were a school for future politi
cal activity, perhaps, college students
during and after undergraduate days
would;become intelligent citizens. It'
> campaigns were conducted at Stan
ford, some candidates would attempt
to use unfounded ballyhoo. It is a
I slur, and perhaps a justified slur, on
I Stanford intelligence, to believe that
j students would be fooled by such
practices—meant for ignorant mass
j es. Students will have to face such
ballyhoo on a wholesale scare after
j graduation, and if they are to cope
I with it the way graduates of Euro
; pean universities do, they must be
j trained in uncovering and recogniz
, ing "political bunko" during campus
j life. —Abe Mellinkoff
The most outstanding factor asso
ciated with many countries is revo
lution—and.the most consistent fac
tor accompanying revolutions are
student uprisings. In Spain—in
Mexico—in the South American
countries, it is the student class that
has often started moves for more
liberal governments. It is the student
who takes a part in serious govern
mental affairs in these countries.
But in America collegians spend
their time on different matters. In
these other lands students cheer the
