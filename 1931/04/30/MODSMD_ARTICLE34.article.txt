THE SECRET SIX—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Mayor Cermak, Chicago's pugna
cious Pole, should see this one. Wal
lace Beery throws his face out of
joint in a gang thriller that actually
manages tt) thrill, although it is hard
to get used to Beery as a real, hon
est-to-God, through-and-through
bad man, after so many "not-such
a-bad-'un-after-all" parts.
Lewis Stone is the usual consum
mate actor and a gentleman always
even when he is a crook, and even
Jean Harlow's too obviously perox
ided hair fails to detract from her
vampish charms.
Hollywood may have seen the
light of day at last, or perhaps it just
lapsed into a coma while an able
director went ahead and did what
he wanted to all the time, but what
ever it was, the result is a realistic
picture of gang warfare with not

too many sawed-off shotguns, ma- |
| chine guns, gats, and pineapples, but I
| enough suspense to make Chicago |
i seem one fine place to be "from."
If you don't mind the hero being
| killed on the brink of success and :
! waiting to the last to see the wicked j
| punished this is one picture not to '
' miss. Too bad they don't keep these |
j Mickey Mouse comedies to leaven (
[ the boredom of much duller and >
