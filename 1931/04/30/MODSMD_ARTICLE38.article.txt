"How is Dink going (o run
Vm?" That question was heard
frequently hereabouts several
weeks ago, hut now nohody
seems to be bothered about how
they'll run, but only about how
they'll finish. II seems to be all
settled in the minds of several
thousand "experts" that so-and
so of the Indians will run this
or-that race, and that Cromwell
of the Trojans will do no shift
ing of his lineup. In eagerness to
dope the meet, the average
track-hungry fan is overlook
ing a hit of possibilities.
Ben Bangs Eastman, the Indian
triple-threater, presents the tough
est problem. Robert L. Templeton, in
scoring another newspaper scoop on
track for his paper, the Call-Bul
letin, Tuesday evening, stated em
phatically that his blond and be
spectacled "natural" would run the
440, 880, and relay. But yesterday
Ben had to have his big toe-nail re
moved because of an infection un
der it, something that will undoubt
edly limit him to only two races
Saturday. The rubbing of a leather
shoe. upon a spot where only re
cently there was a toe-nail, can be
expected to affect the running of
anyone, even Eastman.
<♦> <♦> <♦>
That Dink will keep him out
of the quarter-mile, until re
cently his specialty, is almost a
certainty. Despite the toe opera
tion, Ben should have little
trouble in breaking the tape of
the half and the relay. Too bad
the much-heralded Eastman-
Williams battle is lost to the paid
customers, hut Vic hasn't the 140
in the burlap yet by a long shot.
"Our man" Leslie Hables, unless
we guess wrong, will be battling it
mt with Mr. Williams, along with
Maynor Shove and Ike Hables. By
eason of Shove's 48.3 behind East
nan in practice the other day, May
lor should be figured a toss-up
igainst the muchly touted Trojan.
Lies probably won't run the 220,
iince the century is really, his race
md will tire him less than the fur
ong.
For the relay, then. Dink will
have the Hables brothers, Shove,
and Eastman. What this quar
tet can do to the world's mark
of 31:15.4 set by last year's four
is something to think about. Les
is nearly two seconds faster than
.liui Howell of the 1930 team.
Shove and Ike Hables arc run
ning better than they did last
season, and Eastman is capable
of a better final hip than Johnny
Morrison, anchor man for the
record-holders.
Cromwell claims that he can put
better relay team on the track
ban the quartet which was timed
i 3:15.8 two weeks ago, by substi
uting Pearsons for Dow or Oswald,
•'he other possible shift by Crom
/ell could come in the hurdles,
/here he may decide to run. Payne,
!arls, or Powers in the high sticks
s well as in the lows. Until now,
his trio of stars has confined its
Hurts to the one race, while Stokes
; Troy's only star in the high bar
iers.
Let us go on record right now
as favoring Hec Dyer to beat
our Frank Wykolf in the 220.
Hec i;s running at his best, while
the Southern flash is no better
than he was last year. Frank
has never taken Dyer's measure
iu the furlong. WykofT invari
ably leads the Indian star at the
half-way mark, but Dyer's
strong finish is too much for
him. —Crawford

"Our man" Leslie Hables, unless

Lies probably won't run the 220,

For the relay, then. Dink will
have the Hables brothers, Shove,
and Eastman. What this quar
tet can do to the world's mark
of 31:15.4 set by last year's four
is something to think about. Les
is nearly two seconds faster than
.liui Howell of the 1930 team.
Shove and Ike Hables arc run
ning better than they did last
season, and Eastman is capable
of a better final hip than Johnny
Morrison, anchor man for the
record-holders.

Let us go on record right now
as favoring Hec Dyer to beat
our Frank Wykolf in the 220.
Hec i;s running at his best, while
the Southern flash is no better
than he was last year. Frank
has never taken Dyer's measure
iu the furlong. WykofT invari
ably leads the Indian star at the
half-way mark, but Dyer's
strong finish is too much for
him. —Crawford
"How is Dink going (o run

frequently hereabouts several
weeks ago, hut now nohody
seems to be bothered about how

they'll finish. II seems to be all
settled in the minds of several
thousand "experts" that so-and
so of the Indians will run this
or-that race, and that Cromwell
of the Trojans will do no shift
ing of his lineup. In eagerness to
dope the meet, the average
track-hungry fan is overlook
ing a hit of possibilities.
Ben Bangs Eastman, the Indian
triple-threater, presents the tough
est problem. Robert L. Templeton, in
scoring another newspaper scoop on
track for his paper, the Call-Bul
letin, Tuesday evening, stated em
phatically that his blond and be
spectacled "natural" would run the
440, 880, and relay. But yesterday
Ben had to have his big toe-nail re
moved because of an infection un
der it, something that will undoubt
edly limit him to only two races
Saturday. The rubbing of a leather
shoe. upon a spot where only re
cently there was a toe-nail, can be
expected to affect the running of
anyone, even Eastman.

That Dink will keep him out
of the quarter-mile, until re
