# Negotiations for Japanese Baseball Tour Fail
## FINAL GAME WILL BE WITH IGNATIAN NINE ON SATURDAY Diamond Contest To Start After Pinal Event Of S.C. Track Meet 
### Francis Lloyd 
All hope for a Japanese trip this
summer for the Stanford baseball
nine is ended. Communications with
the Japanese universities revealed
that the proposed trip would be im
possible. The official termination of
the current baseball season will
come, therefore, with the playing of
the San Francisco University game
on Saturday on the local diamond.
Because a baseball game had not
been planned for the same day as
the U.S.C. track meet, which is
scheduled at 2:30 o'clock, the ball
game will not be called until the
Trojan-Card meet is finished, which
will probably be about 3:45 o'clock.
Delmas Still Out
Although the hope was expressed
that Bert Delmas might be able to
return to the lineup for Saturday's
game, the latest reports from the
doctor indicate that this will be im
possible. However this leaves the
shortstop position in the capable
hands of Mac Cutshaw who has been
giving good performances in practice
for the past two weeks.
Finding the orthodox way of
catching flies too uninteresting, Cap
tain Hunken, Gordy Campbell, and
Jim Kelly inaugurated a "circus
catch" competition, which consisted
of gathering in the flies in all man
ner of strange positions.
Hunken Grabs Honors
First prize was unanimously given
to Captain Hunken for a "bow
down-and-pray-to-Buddha" catch,
which had all the earmarks of Mr.
A1 G. Barnes' trained animal fea
tures. (Adv.)
The infield combination of Hardy,
Philippi, Cutshaw, and Johnson
worked out with more snap and ac
curacy than has been seen for a
long time. Double-plays should oc
cur with startling frequency on Sat
urday, if the playing of Harry Wol
ter's infield come up to their usual
form shown in practice sessions of
the past two weeks.
