## 
### 
The seniors nosed out the juniors
by a narrow margin of 1-0 in the
second game of the interclass soccer
series yesterday.
The only score of the game came
in the first period, when Reynolds,
playing left wing for the senior,
made a beautiful corner kick after
an out of bounds. The senior for
wards rushed in cn masse and fin- |
ally got the ball passed the hard
pressed goalie.
The third year men were con- ,
fronted with a team composed ;
largely of varsity players, and put j
up a splendid fight throughout the
entire game.
The next game of the series will !
be played Friday, when the seniors j
are scheduled to meet the fresh- j
men. I
