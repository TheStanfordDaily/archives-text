# "BIG TENT" HERE RECALLS FORMER STRANDED CIRCUS
## 
### 
nEPARTURE of the circus
" yesterday morning from the
Palo Alto station brought a
of relief from resident
townsmen and the old guard
of the campus. Local tradition
still nurses scars and claw
murks of a circus that did not
leave.
It was way hack in the win
ter of 1!)21 that Roberts Bros,
circus dug in for a day's show
in Palo Alto. Ordinarily the
show would pack up and leave
before morning. But one of the
partners absconded with the
cash drawer, to pitch tent else
where. The circus was stranded.
A tiger got loose in Palo Alto
during the shuffle. An elephant
turned up in Menlo to add a
hit of realism. A group of mon
keys visited their brethren over
near the Pavilion.
Residents contributed enough
money to tide over the circus
for the winter, and in the
spring the animals were sold at
auction to agents of other cir
cuses.
