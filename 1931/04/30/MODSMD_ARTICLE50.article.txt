# MACNAUGHTON HAS TRAUTMAN 2 DOWN ON FIRST 18 HOLES
## Second Half Of Match To Be Played Today At 1 o'Clock Here 
### 
Taking a three-hole lead on the
| first nine, Malcolm MacNaughton
l finished the first half of his quarter
final match with Jerry Trautman,
2 up, yesterday afternoon on the
| Stanford course.
With a place in the semi-finals of
the University championship and
I the honor of varsity golf at stake,
the two will play the remaining 18
1 holes of their match this afternoon
j at 1 o'clock.
That MacNaughton's present lead
is far from a commanding one is
indicated by analysis of their match
yesterday. Mac stroked close to par
golf to walk off the ninth green
with a three hole lead.
Trautman straightway won the
jlO th, 12th, and 14th holes and
halved the 11th and 13th, to square
the match. Then he played a fine
i tee shot on the 15th and watched
| Mac plump his ball into the creek.
Here occurred the turning point
j of the match.
Taking another ball out of his
bag, Mac smashed out a long,
j straight drive, followed it up with
I a longer and straighter brassie shot,
and holed a 15-foot put for his four
| and his half.
On the next hole Trautman made
j a wonderful recovery from the
! rough to keep the match even, but
he three putted the 17th to go one
| down. MacNaughton's 310 - yard
i drive clinched him the 18th and a
I comfortable lead.
If Mac staves off the challenge
| of Trautman today, he will meet
I Herman Hellman in the semi-finals,
j This is a match he should win with
little difficulty, which would mean
| a position in the finals for him.
j There he would play either Lawson
' Little, Charlie Seaver, or Gene
| Brown, all freshmen and all threats.
