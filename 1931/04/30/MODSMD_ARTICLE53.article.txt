# ENTRANTS IN W.A.A. DIVOT TOURNAMENT WILL HOLD MEETING
## 
### 
All women interested in entering
the W.A.A. golf tournament to be
started early next week are urged
to attend a meeting which will be
held this afternoon at 4 o'clock in
the locker room of the women's
gymnasium. Marion Hewlett has
been appointed by Gertrude Laid
law, W.A.A. president, to make all
arrangements.
The tournament, the first to be
held by the "500", is not so much
to determine the University cham
pionship as to see if enough interest
is taken in golf to award W.A.A.
points for participation. It will be
composed of two flights, qualifying
round and match play.
As many women as can are urged
to come out, and if they cannot at
tend the meeting this afternoon,
they may sign up on a list to be
posted on the gym bulletin board.
