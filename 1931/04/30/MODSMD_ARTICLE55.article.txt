## 
### 
Mixed doubles seems to be a fash
ionable game at the present time if
the number entering the annual
tennis tourney may be taken as an
indication. Approximately seven
teams have signed entry lists and
about twelve partnerless men and
women have signified their inten
tion to play.
Under the supervision of Elwyn
Bugge, tennis instructor, a commit
tee will make the pairings on Fri
day afternoon. He urges that more
people enter the tournament as is
it essential that at least sixteen
teams participate. Entry lists will
be closed on Friday and drawings
are to be made then. Play is to
start on May 3 and the finals will
be held the middle of the month,
Bugge announced.
Lists have been posted in Roble
and Encina gymnasiums and anyone
who is interested in tennis may en
ter. Seeding of teams will be made
by the committee on the basis of
the participants ability at the game.
