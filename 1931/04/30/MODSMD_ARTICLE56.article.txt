I tipping over the league-leading
! Theta Chi crew, 13 to 1(/. Harry
j Plymire hurled the Alpha Delts to
victory over Alpha Sigma Phi by a
i score of 19 to 7, in the only other
! game scheduled. It was the Alpha
Delts' second triumph of the year.
The Alpha Sigs lead off by gain
ing one run, but the score was im
| mediately tied up by the victors.
: After the first inning, Plymire ef
fectively curbed the Alpha Sigma
Phi batting attack until the fifth,
! when he faltered and allowed four
runs to come in. A pair of tallies
; in their last time at the plate com
pleted the Alpha Sigs' scoring.
The Alpha Delts had two big in-
I nings, the third and fourth when
they bunched hits to drive in ten
and seven runs respectively. The
1 winners displayed some heavy stick -
work, combined with good work in
the field plus the battery comjoina
] tion of Plymire and Lucas. Avery
and Scott were the Alpha Sig bat
i tery.
The Sequoia-Theta Chi affair was
closely played throughout. Hunni
cutt connected with one of Howe's
offerings for a home run in the first
inning, for the one feature :n an
otherwise listless contest. Mack
worked on the mound for Sequoia
with Baker receiving while Howe
j and Dole were the Theta Chi bat
| tery.
