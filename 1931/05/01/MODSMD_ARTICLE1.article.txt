# INDIANS FAVORED TO VANQUISH TROY IN TRACK CLASSIC
## Preparations Made For Annual Appeal In Community Drive Baumgarten Organizes Committees in Work Toward Ultimate $4,000 Goal for Convalescent Home Children; To Furnish Babcock Unit STUDENTS EACH ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE $2.50 Enthusiastic Mother Lauds Beneficial Aid Given Son; Promises to Rename Child "Stanford" 
### 
AN enthusiastic meeting of all committees last night, and various indi
vidual committee meetings yesterday culminated final preparations for
Stanford's "own charity" drive to begin Monday. Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
president of the Convalescent Home Board, in speaking before the group
last night, said: "If you love children and sympathize with those less
fortunate than yourself you cannot help but be a willing contributor to
such an appeal as this. When you give money to the Stanford Conva
lescent Home, you are giving to a splendidly managed, well-organized

institution on a firm business foun
dation which depends on your help
annually."

A goal of $4,000 has been set for
this year, according to Bob Baum
garten, head, and students are urged
to see the Home, judge of its merit,
and then give as liberally as pos
sible. A contribution of $2.50 will
cover the cost of the care of one
child for one day.
Labor Day Wednesday
Labor Day, which is set for Wed
nesday, will complete the three-day
appeal, and students will flock to the
Home to wash windows, cut and
store wood, clean the grounds, paint,
rake, and put the Home in condi
tion for the coming year.
The Stanford, McLaughlin, Bab
cock, and Auxiliary Board units
comprise the Home which is located
on ground leased from the Univer
sity for $1 a year, occupying 26
acres of the old Stanford Homesite.
The Babcock unit is at the present
unoccupied since sufficient funds for
maintaining it, and the admission
ward which it requires, are not at
hand.
Need More Funds
If sufficient funds could be raised,
many additional heart cases which
can not now be properly cared for,
could be taken. Last year the Home
accommodated 163 patients and had
an occupancy of 96 per cent. About
45 children can be housed at the
game time under the present con
ditions.
So successful has the work of the
Home been, that one enthusiastic
and grateful mother has promised
to rechristen her small son "Stan
ford" as soon as he is released from
the excellent care which is rapidly
restoring him to health.
