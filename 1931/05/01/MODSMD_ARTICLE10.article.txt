# WILL OUT-GENERAL CROMWELL TOMORROW

### 

Most everyone around these parts needs no introduction to this gentleman, but for the benefit of those
who use the Library on Friday nights, this is Robert Lyman "Dink" Templeton, Stanford's veteran, track coach
and quite the best in the country. "Dink" used to be called a "boy coach," but that's a journalistic error now;
he's coached so many winning track squads here that the unpleasantness of it all makes the passing years seem
like weeks.
