# SINCLAIR OIL FIRE DEFIES CONTROL; WILL BLAST WELL
## 
### 
GLADEWATER, Tex, April 30
(/P). â€”Preliminaries to an attempt to
blast away the pillar of fire rising
from the Sinclair oil gusher near
here were under way tonight, but it
was estimated the charge of nitro
glycerin could not be placed before
Saturday and possibly later.
Fed by a huge flow of oil and
gas, the flames roared on as a small
army of workmen prepared the set
ting for two Oklahoma brothers, M.
M. and Harry Kinley, to do their
death-defying act of setting off a
heavy charge of explosives at the
base of the fire which has claimed
eight lives.
The brothers, noted through the
oil fields as wild well tamers, rushed
to Tulsa by airplane today and
started back with additional ex
plosives and asbestos suits.
