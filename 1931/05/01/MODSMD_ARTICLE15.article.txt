# YOSEMITE EMPLOYEE PAINTS ROCK; FIRED

YOSEMITE, April 30. â€” For
thoughtlessly painting his initials on
a rock, Charles B. Higgins, employe
of the government in Yosemite Na
tional Park, who evidently was not
familiar with one of the most rigidly
enforced national park rules, is to
day out of a job.
The initials, daubed on a rock
near Nevada Falls, were discovered
and identified yesterday by a mem
ber of the ranger service. This
morning the crestfallen Higgins
climbed the trail and scrubbed off
the defacing "C. B. H.," and tonight
he leaves the park to seek a job in
new fields.
