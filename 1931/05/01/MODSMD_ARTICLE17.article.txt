### 
CANTON, April 30 (/P).â€”This cap
ital of Kwangtung Province, from
which the victorious march was be
gun in 1926 which resulted in the
Nationalist government being set up
in Nanking the following April, was
stirred today by rumors of impend
ing rebellion in Kwangtung and the
neighboring Kwangsi province.
Chinese officials denied that re
volt was brewing, but the foreign
colony on, Shameen Island in the
Pearl river increased the guards on
the bridges connecting it with the
native city and restricted movements
of Chinese to and from the settle
ment.
Reports were widely circulated
that insurgents, bolstered with funds
obtained from opium revenues, were
plotting to gain control of the pro
vincial governments.
