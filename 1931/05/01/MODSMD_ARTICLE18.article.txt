MADRID, April 30 (£»).—A war of
words was waged today in the Span
ish press be'tween Miguel Maura,
minister of government at Madrid,
and Colonel Francisco Macia, presi
dent of the Catalonian common
wealth, over Catalonia's aspirations
to separate nationhood.
Maura, commenting upon Barce
lona advices of announcement of a
complete Catalan ministerial roster,
said that whatever might take place
in Barcelona, the Catalonian gov
ernment would not be allowed to
renounce the central power and au
thority at Madrid.
Answering, Colonel Macia said
that he was surprised at the tone of
Sr. Maura's remarks, which ap

agreed upon ten days by which
Catalonia promised not to press its
separatist claims pending a meeting
of a constitutional convention.
