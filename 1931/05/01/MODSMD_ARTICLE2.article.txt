MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 30. (IP) —
Organization of the next congress
by a Democratic-Progressive coali
tion was suggested in a statement
here today by Senator McKellar,
Democrat, Tennessee.
"The people failed to elect a Re
publican congress last November
and elected a congress in which
Democrats predominate in both
houses," he said. "Under these cir
cumstances the Democratic Party is
in duty bound to organize each
house if possible.
"The Progressives in each house
are much more favorable to Demo
cratic policies than they are to the
old line Republican policies. They

have long co-operated with the
Democrats in the senate. They are
willing to do so in the house.
