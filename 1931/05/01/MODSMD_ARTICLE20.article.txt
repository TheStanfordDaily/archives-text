# S. C. Trackmen Due On Campus Early Tomorrow
## Eastman Picked as Cinch in 880; Halstead Expected To Win Mile with Ease; Remaining Winners Difficult to Pick in Contest 220 IS DYER'S BEST BET TO TAKE WYKOFF Les 						Hables to Run Only 440, Relay; Meet May Hinge on Performance of Podge Smith in Hurdles 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
a long, drawn-out whistle froni a northbound train bearing Dean
Cromwell and the cream of Southern California track talent sounds
its warning early tomorrow morning to motorists on the Palo Alto cross
ing, the Thundering Herd of track will have issued its challenge to Dink
Tempeton's Indians for the battle of the century. Some 40 strong, this
horde of Trojan stars will invade the Stadium at 2:15 to 'engage in what
looms as the closest, most hard-fought meet in the history of track at
Stanford, a meet which will virtually decide the championship of the
country. Cold dope favors the Cardinal cause, with a final score of 70 to
61 looking about right. However, either team, by getting all the "breaks,"
could smother its opponent under 80 points. So closely matched are the
rival athletes that even the favorites in their respective specialties will

have to be on their toes to be certain
of registering in the point column.
But two events on the track are
"cinches"; in the remaining seven
anything could happen. Ben Bangs
Eastman, the sophomore whom
Templeton has developed into the
greatest half-miler in the country
today, takes care of Stanford's "sure
thing."
Halstead Cinch in Mile
Cliff Halstead, a miler capable of
better than 4:20, is U.S.C.'s certainty.
So numerous are the potential
thrillers, picking the outstanding
event of the day is a hopeless task.
Probably the dashes present most
potential interest, although Frankie
Wykoff, world's champion, is gen
erally conceded victories in both the
century and the furlong.
Hector Dyer, however, will have
to be beaten out by the "Glendale
Flash," not only once, but twice.
Last year the dope bucket stood as
it does now, and Hec pushed it over
in fine style, taking the hundred
and running a dead heat in the 220.
Dyer Best in 220

Despite this, the longer race is
Dyer's best bet. In the California
Intercollegiates of 1930, the Indian
speedster lost the century to Wykoff,
only to corpe back and lead by a
yard at the 220 tape.
The long awaited Vic Williams-
Ben Eastman 440 battle will prob
ably not take place, since Dink is
almost certain to keep Ben out of
the one-lap event. Les Hables, how
ever, will most likely run only the
440 and the relay tomorrow, which
means that Williams can be assured
of exactly nothing, even though his
most formidable rival is on the
bench.
Eight-Lap Thriller
The eight-lap grind, usually uti
lized by the fans as an intermission,
promises for once to be a thriller.
Paul Aebersold, plucky little self
made distance man, is conceded only
a second to Unruh of S.C. Callahan
of Troy figures third, though any
one of this trio is equally capable of
breaking the tape.
On the hurdles races the entire
meet might be said to hinge. Cap
tain "Podge" Smith can take any
where from 10 to four points. The
Trojan captain, Ernie Payne, rules
a slight favorite in the low sticks,
by reason of his 23.4. time in the
Mercury meet. "Podge" ran 23.5
against California two weeks ago.
The high barriers, however, pre
sent a reversed situation. Smith is
almost a certainty Tor first, while his
teammate, Nisbet, is doped with an
outside chance for second ahead of
Bill Stokes, Troy's best.
On the field, the man to watch is
Bob Hall of U.S.C. Every Trojan
fan in the stands will be tense and
waiting each time this giant tosses
an iron weight. If he can take six
points, the visitors believe they have
the meet in the well-known burlap.
Against Bobby Jones, Here La
bovde, and Norm McLeod in the
platter-throwing contest, Hall can
be given no better than a third. He
has an outside chance of being out
ahead of Laborde in the shot, how
ever, while Nellie Gray is winning
the event without much trouble at
49 feet or so.
Pole Vault Doubtful
Much depends on Burt DeGroot's
pole vaulting tomorrow. Graber of
S.C. is his equal; either can win. In
the javelin, Ray, Zuger, and Boeger
or Rintala should bring Stanford
about eight points. A second and a
third from the broadjumping pits is
expected from Butler, West, or Wer
der. Barber of Troy is the favorite.
If the two teams come in neck and
neck up to the final event of the
meet, Stanford will win. The two
Hables brothers, Maynor Shove, and
Ben Eastman are a cinch to take the
relay from the best U.S.C. can offer,
despite the Trojan time of 3:15.8,
clocked in the L.A.A.C. encounter.

Dyer's best bet. In the California
Intercollegiates of 1930, the Indian
speedster lost the century to Wykoff,
only to corpe back and lead by a
yard at the 220 tape.
The long awaited Vic Williams-
Ben Eastman 440 battle will prob
ably not take place, since Dink is
almost certain to keep Ben out of
the one-lap event. Les Hables, how
ever, will most likely run only the
440 and the relay tomorrow, which
means that Williams can be assured
of exactly nothing, even though his
most formidable rival is on the
bench.
Eight-Lap Thriller
The eight-lap grind, usually uti
lized by the fans as an intermission,
promises for once to be a thriller.
Paul Aebersold, plucky little self
made distance man, is conceded only
a second to Unruh of S.C. Callahan
of Troy figures third, though any
one of this trio is equally capable of
breaking the tape.
On the hurdles races the entire
meet might be said to hinge. Cap
tain "Podge" Smith can take any
where from 10 to four points. The
Trojan captain, Ernie Payne, rules
a slight favorite in the low sticks,
by reason of his 23.4. time in the
Mercury meet. "Podge" ran 23.5
against California two weeks ago.
The high barriers, however, pre
sent a reversed situation. Smith is
almost a certainty Tor first, while his
teammate, Nisbet, is doped with an
outside chance for second ahead of
Bill Stokes, Troy's best.
On the field, the man to watch is
Bob Hall of U.S.C. Every Trojan
fan in the stands will be tense and
waiting each time this giant tosses
an iron weight. If he can take six
points, the visitors believe they have
the meet in the well-known burlap.
Against Bobby Jones, Here La
bovde, and Norm McLeod in the
platter-throwing contest, Hall can
be given no better than a third. He
has an outside chance of being out
ahead of Laborde in the shot, how
ever, while Nellie Gray is winning
the event without much trouble at
49 feet or so.
Pole Vault Doubtful
Much depends on Burt DeGroot's
pole vaulting tomorrow. Graber of
S.C. is his equal; either can win. In
the javelin, Ray, Zuger, and Boeger
or Rintala should bring Stanford
about eight points. A second and a
third from the broadjumping pits is
expected from Butler, West, or Wer
der. Barber of Troy is the favorite.
If the two teams come in neck and
neck up to the final event of the
meet, Stanford will win. The two
Hables brothers, Maynor Shove, and
Ben Eastman are a cinch to take the
relay from the best U.S.C. can offer,
despite the Trojan time of 3:15.8,
clocked in the L.A.A.C. encounter.
a long, drawn-out whistle froni a northbound train bearing Dean
Cromwell and the cream of Southern California track talent sounds
its warning early tomorrow morning to motorists on the Palo Alto cross
ing, the Thundering Herd of track will have issued its challenge to Dink
Tempeton's Indians for the battle of the century. Some 40 strong, this
horde of Trojan stars will invade the Stadium at 2:15 to 'engage in what
looms as the closest, most hard-fought meet in the history of track at
Stanford, a meet which will virtually decide the championship of the
country. Cold dope favors the Cardinal cause, with a final score of 70 to
61 looking about right. However, either team, by getting all the "breaks,"
could smother its opponent under 80 points. So closely matched are the
rival athletes that even the favorites in their respective specialties will

have to be on their toes to be certain
of registering in the point column.
But two events on the track are
"cinches"; in the remaining seven
anything could happen. Ben Bangs
Eastman, the sophomore whom
Templeton has developed into the
greatest half-miler in the country
today, takes care of Stanford's "sure
thing."
Halstead Cinch in Mile
Cliff Halstead, a miler capable of
better than 4:20, is U.S.C.'s certainty.
So numerous are the potential
thrillers, picking the outstanding
event of the day is a hopeless task.
Probably the dashes present most
potential interest, although Frankie
Wykoff, world's champion, is gen
erally conceded victories in both the
century and the furlong.
Hector Dyer, however, will have
to be beaten out by the "Glendale
Flash," not only once, but twice.
Last year the dope bucket stood as
it does now, and Hec pushed it over
in fine style, taking the hundred
and running a dead heat in the 220.

Much depends on Burt DeGroot's
pole vaulting tomorrow. Graber of
S.C. is his equal; either can win. In
the javelin, Ray, Zuger, and Boeger
or Rintala should bring Stanford
about eight points. A second and a
third from the broadjumping pits is
expected from Butler, West, or Wer
der. Barber of Troy is the favorite.
If the two teams come in neck and
neck up to the final event of the
meet, Stanford will win. The two
Hables brothers, Maynor Shove, and
Ben Eastman are a cinch to take the
relay from the best U.S.C. can offer,
despite the Trojan time of 3:15.8,
clocked in the L.A.A.C. encounter.
a long, drawn-out whistle froni a northbound train bearing Dean
Cromwell and the cream of Southern California track talent sounds
its warning early tomorrow morning to motorists on the Palo Alto cross
ing, the Thundering Herd of track will have issued its challenge to Dink
Tempeton's Indians for the battle of the century. Some 40 strong, this
horde of Trojan stars will invade the Stadium at 2:15 to 'engage in what
looms as the closest, most hard-fought meet in the history of track at
Stanford, a meet which will virtually decide the championship of the
country. Cold dope favors the Cardinal cause, with a final score of 70 to
61 looking about right. However, either team, by getting all the "breaks,"
could smother its opponent under 80 points. So closely matched are the
rival athletes that even the favorites in their respective specialties will

have to be on their toes to be certain
of registering in the point column.
But two events on the track are
"cinches"; in the remaining seven
anything could happen. Ben Bangs
Eastman, the sophomore whom
Templeton has developed into the
greatest half-miler in the country
today, takes care of Stanford's "sure
thing."
Halstead Cinch in Mile
Cliff Halstead, a miler capable of
better than 4:20, is U.S.C.'s certainty.
So numerous are the potential
thrillers, picking the outstanding
event of the day is a hopeless task.
Probably the dashes present most
potential interest, although Frankie
Wykoff, world's champion, is gen
erally conceded victories in both the
century and the furlong.
Hector Dyer, however, will have
to be beaten out by the "Glendale
Flash," not only once, but twice.
Last year the dope bucket stood as
it does now, and Hec pushed it over
in fine style, taking the hundred
and running a dead heat in the 220.
Dyer Best in 220

Despite this, the longer race is
Dyer's best bet. In the California
Intercollegiates of 1930, the Indian
speedster lost the century to Wykoff,
only to corpe back and lead by a
yard at the 220 tape.
The long awaited Vic Williams-
Ben Eastman 440 battle will prob
ably not take place, since Dink is
almost certain to keep Ben out of
the one-lap event. Les Hables, how
ever, will most likely run only the
440 and the relay tomorrow, which
means that Williams can be assured
of exactly nothing, even though his
most formidable rival is on the
bench.
Eight-Lap Thriller
The eight-lap grind, usually uti
lized by the fans as an intermission,
promises for once to be a thriller.
Paul Aebersold, plucky little self
made distance man, is conceded only
a second to Unruh of S.C. Callahan
of Troy figures third, though any
one of this trio is equally capable of
breaking the tape.
On the hurdles races the entire
meet might be said to hinge. Cap
tain "Podge" Smith can take any
where from 10 to four points. The
Trojan captain, Ernie Payne, rules
a slight favorite in the low sticks,
by reason of his 23.4. time in the
Mercury meet. "Podge" ran 23.5
against California two weeks ago.
The high barriers, however, pre
sent a reversed situation. Smith is
almost a certainty Tor first, while his
teammate, Nisbet, is doped with an
outside chance for second ahead of
Bill Stokes, Troy's best.
On the field, the man to watch is
Bob Hall of U.S.C. Every Trojan
fan in the stands will be tense and
waiting each time this giant tosses
an iron weight. If he can take six
points, the visitors believe they have
the meet in the well-known burlap.
Against Bobby Jones, Here La
bovde, and Norm McLeod in the
platter-throwing contest, Hall can
be given no better than a third. He
has an outside chance of being out
ahead of Laborde in the shot, how
ever, while Nellie Gray is winning
the event without much trouble at
49 feet or so.
