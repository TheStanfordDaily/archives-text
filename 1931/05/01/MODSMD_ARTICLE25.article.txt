# THE 						FOUR-YEAR INVESTMENT
## 
### 
Recent and frequent have been the surveys purporting
to show the money value of a college education. Now
comes the report of Walter J. Greenleaf, "associate special
ist in high education" of the Federal Office of Education.
This report shows that the questionnaires, surveys, and
estimates of the monetary value of education are at best
unreliable and misleading.
In commenting 011 this report, the editor of The Daily
Princetonian observed: "It is becoming apparent that for
fin increasing number of undergraduates the four years of
university life are chiefly a financial investment: the ex
ternal acknowledgment, the diploma, in its function of
'social background' and 'vocational recommend a iton,' is
rapidly superseding the education itself in point of impor
tance. ...
"Simply because published salary-surveys are an ac
knowledgment of the existence of this unfortunate under
graduate attitude, they are at the same time an encourage
ment of it—a sort of tacit official approval. We are tempted
to suggest that the results of such investigations be confined
to the ledgers of statisticians, and that, as a substitute, the
Federal Office of Education make a yearly survey among
college men to determine the answer to the question: 'What
percentage of graduates find it necessary to get soused after
business hours in order to keep their minds off themselves
until the next day's money-grubbing begins?"
The fact that surveys and estimates of the value in
American dollars of an American collegiate education are
generally inaccurate and unreliable will not change the
attitude of undergraduate college students. They know the
economic value of the college experience, whether they are
able to assay it exactly at $1.33 increment in annual in
come for every day of college work or not.
But in the current and popular appreciation of the value
of the college years, strictly formal education is not the
only factor. And this is quite proper; it should not be the!
sole factor. Other types of experience can and should con
tribute to the value of college education. Most of them can
be summed up in the experience of four years' association
with charming' and intelligent people, students and instruc
tors. But these other types are not, oddly enough, the ones
most emphasized by those who see in college education
value apart from its formal and academic aspects.
The surest value of the four-year investment, to those
who critically analyze it, with the mental attitude of in
vestors, lies in three things: the prestige of having a col
lege degree, especially from an institution of renown; the
acquaintance of fellow-students whose "connections" will
be of value in after-college years, and who will be men en
gaged in contemporary business activity; and, to a certain
extent, the preliminary acquaintance with economic theory
and business practice in certain college courses.
These investors probably get their dividends, but they
miss the opportunity of enjoying a much higher potential
return.

most emphasized by those who see in college education
value apart from its formal and academic aspects.
The surest value of the four-year investment, to those
who critically analyze it, with the mental attitude of in
vestors, lies in three things: the prestige of having a col
lege degree, especially from an institution of renown; the
acquaintance of fellow-students whose "connections" will
be of value in after-college years, and who will be men en
gaged in contemporary business activity; and, to a certain
extent, the preliminary acquaintance with economic theory
and business practice in certain college courses.
These investors probably get their dividends, but they
miss the opportunity of enjoying a much higher potential
return.
Recent and frequent have been the surveys purporting
to show the money value of a college education. Now
comes the report of Walter J. Greenleaf, "associate special
ist in high education" of the Federal Office of Education.
This report shows that the questionnaires, surveys, and
estimates of the monetary value of education are at best
unreliable and misleading.
In commenting 011 this report, the editor of The Daily
Princetonian observed: "It is becoming apparent that for
fin increasing number of undergraduates the four years of
university life are chiefly a financial investment: the ex
ternal acknowledgment, the diploma, in its function of
'social background' and 'vocational recommend a iton,' is
rapidly superseding the education itself in point of impor
tance. ...
"Simply because published salary-surveys are an ac
knowledgment of the existence of this unfortunate under
graduate attitude, they are at the same time an encourage
ment of it—a sort of tacit official approval. We are tempted
to suggest that the results of such investigations be confined
to the ledgers of statisticians, and that, as a substitute, the
Federal Office of Education make a yearly survey among
college men to determine the answer to the question: 'What
percentage of graduates find it necessary to get soused after
business hours in order to keep their minds off themselves
until the next day's money-grubbing begins?"
The fact that surveys and estimates of the value in
American dollars of an American collegiate education are
generally inaccurate and unreliable will not change the
attitude of undergraduate college students. They know the
economic value of the college experience, whether they are
able to assay it exactly at $1.33 increment in annual in
come for every day of college work or not.
But in the current and popular appreciation of the value
of the college years, strictly formal education is not the
only factor. And this is quite proper; it should not be the!
sole factor. Other types of experience can and should con
tribute to the value of college education. Most of them can
be summed up in the experience of four years' association
with charming' and intelligent people, students and instruc
tors. But these other types are not, oddly enough, the ones
most emphasized by those who see in college education
value apart from its formal and academic aspects.
