# $30,000 WORTH?

Now lhat the much-heralded and widely discussed gate
ways to the University have approached a state of near
completion, the Stanford rough may well view them with
perplexity and query, "What the hell?"
Thirty thousand dollars is not a staggering sum to an
institution of this size, but it should not take a great deal
of thought to suggest a better way to spend such an amount
with so many of the University's departments held back by
a lamentable lack of money.
Certainly the gateways were not necessary. Beautifi
cation of the entrance to the University was the sole excuse
for erecting them, and there is room for doubt whether
. they will accomplish that commendable purpose. The old
gateways may not have been imposing, but it strikes the
opkual observer that they would have done as well as the
p ew ones when it comes to improving the landscape, and
/done it some $30,000 cheaper.
