The San Jose News in an article
of microscopic proportions claims
that we are an iconoclast. Now al
though the article was small—so
small in fact that no one but our
selves could possibly have seen it —
we were disturbed by the charge,
for an iconoclast is "one who attacks
cherished beliefs as impositions and
shams." While it may be true that
we have adopted the policy of
telling people that their pet "Santa
Clauses" do not exist; and while we
may have set our eye "on the far
and high star of shining truth"—not
noticing whether we happened to
be treading on toes while following
our "star," we do not wish to ap
pear in the role of the young Men
chenite slashing here and there with
the artificial vigor of the destructive
adolescent cynic.
To prove that we are not destruc
tive, we must be constructive would
seem to be the implication. Now we
shy at "gushing" over anybody or
' anything but we choose to make a
willing exception for the Stanford
Orchestra. Successful business men
takp great delight in pointing at the
deficiencies in college students, and
to a certain degree they are correct.
It is easy—and easy because it is
very often true —to lean back in an
overstuffed chair and through the
rings of smoke from 75-cent cigars,
tell anxious reporters that collegians
lack initiative, ambition, and ten
acity and other qualities inherent in
the self-made man.
At Stanford, we have at least one
shining exception to these numerous
attacks. There is a group of students

j on. the Farm who have developed a
! synjphony orchestra without assist
| ance from anybody but themselves.
It is usually customary to have the
Ex Committee begin passing reso
lutions before things are done.
I Strange as it may seem, and believe
j it or not, the Stanford orchestra ■ has
j developed without appropriations
j from the student body treasury. The
I members of the orchestra do not get
j letters, trips, uniforms, or even
| recognition. They play for the love
|of it—a strange attitude in this
world where every person wants
something for doing anything.
The orchestra is truely democratic
—it is of the students, by the stu
dents, and for the students. A stu
dent, Daniel Bryant, directs the
performance. We have heard of col
lege fullbacks, halfbacks, and
j throwbacks, but a college director
! of a regular college orchestra is in
! deed something peculiarly outstand
j ing. Now, if this music group were
j a mere conglomeration of would-be
j musicians, there would be little to
j talk about; but our student orchestra
| is to play in the Civic Auditorium
i at San Francisco.
Last quarter when we advocated
more popular programs for the
A.S.S.U. Concert Series, the number
of persons who criticized us was
indeed encouraging for music at
Stanford. If all these people will
support the orchestra, if all these
people will forsake the loud band
for the elevating programs of the
orchestra—the success of a worth
while institution will be assured.

It is easy—and easy because it is
very often true —to lean back in an

the self-made man.
At Stanford, we have at least one
shining exception to these numerous

Ex Committee begin passing reso

I Strange as it may seem, and believe

The orchestra is truely democratic

people will forsake the loud band
for the elevating programs of the
orchestra—the success of a worth

The San Jose News in an article
of microscopic proportions claims
that we are an iconoclast. Now al
though the article was small—so
small in fact that no one but our
selves could possibly have seen it —
we were disturbed by the charge,
for an iconoclast is "one who attacks
cherished beliefs as impositions and
shams." While it may be true that
we have adopted the policy of
telling people that their pet "Santa
Clauses" do not exist; and while we
may have set our eye "on the far
and high star of shining truth"—not
noticing whether we happened to
be treading on toes while following
our "star," we do not wish to ap
pear in the role of the young Men
chenite slashing here and there with
the artificial vigor of the destructive
adolescent cynic.
