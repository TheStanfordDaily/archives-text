Oy, Oscar! unci what a week-end
we haff coming up ahead of us! On
with the unrefined merriment (and
don't forget to carry your student
body card), for next week we have
mid-quarters to cope with, with the
usual worry and hysteria.
All the little honeys up on the
Mills campus today are chatter
ing with joy and excitement, be
cause you know my dear the
Junior Prom down at Stanford
is taking place tonight, and it's
such a nice, long, cozy, quiet,
secluded, thrilling ride down
over the Dumbarton cut-off.
Why, you have no idea ....
And if any of them bring their
spectator (almost said spectral)
bathing suits along, they can enioy
the water carnival tomorrow morn
ing. If all that energy were used on
work day at the Convalescent Home,
instead—someone would have sore
muscles, and say the new pool was a
useless extravagance.
We aren't exactly sure about
the dope sheet contest yet, of
course, but just as long as you
put our score somewhere up in
the thousands, you're pretty
safe. What a meet that should
be, tomorrow. Even if it rains,
the boys are all great little* skid-

ders.
If we'd had anything to say about
the dope sheets, a column would
have been included for rough esti
j mates of the number of fragile fe
j males who will faint in the grand-
I stand, and of the stray dogs who
1 will choose tomorrow to fight off
their time-honored race riot.
Half of the campus is wonder
ing what the heck, while the
Belts and Sigma Nus sit com
placently by. Maybe too many
Belts in years past have thought
themselves victims of delirium
tremendous when hosts of six
foot neighbors appeared at their
formal in pink rompers and
socks, Anyhow, they're perform
ing alone, tomorrow night, while
the Sigma Nus are exclusive and
wait two weeks to he rejuve
nated. Things aren't what they
once were, in the good old days.
A warning: One of our happy lit
tle campus romances of a couple of
years ago has just ended in the
divorce court. He charged her with
being sullen, mean, irritable, mor
bid, disagreeable, nasty, bitter, jeal
ous, heckling, loathsome, insulting,
miserly, selfish, uncivil, inconsider
ate, and an old pal of Nifty Phil
the Deke. But maybe she was a
good cook?

Oy, Oscar! unci what a week-end
we haff coming up ahead of us! On
with the unrefined merriment (and
don't forget to carry your student
body card), for next week we have
mid-quarters to cope with, with the

All the little honeys up on the
Mills campus today are chatter
