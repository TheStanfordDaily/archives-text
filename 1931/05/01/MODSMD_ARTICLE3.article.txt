# Cities All Over World Prepare For May 1 Riots
## Continent Awaits Day With Outlook For Trouble 
### 
LONDON, April 30. (/P) —Once a
source of anxiety to authorities in
a score of European capitals, May
Day seems likely to be observed
quietly tomorrow throughout the
continent.
In London a procession of radicals
will form on the embankment and
march under red flags. Speakers
will indulge in customary outbursts
of oratory. No trouble is expected.
Neither Paris nor Berlin can re
gard the anniversary with quite the
same equanimity. Sufficient police
will be on hand to quell any dis
orders.
Moscow will start two days of
jubilation tomorrow with military
parades, free theatres, and hours of
oratory for the enjoyment of the
proletariat.
In Warsaw police have prepared
by laying in a good supply of gas
bombs and rubber clubs and by ar
resting all suspicious characters.
NEW YORK, April 30. (/P) — A
communist demonstration in Wall
Street, today's prelude to the world
wide observance of May Day to
morrow, was handled by police
without difficulty. About 5,000 spec
tators gathered around the nucleus
of thirty demonstrators, encouraging
them with ironic cheers.
Louis F. Budenz, editor of Labor
Age, one of the speakers, answered
the irony thus:
"You office workers do nothing
but cheer. You have nothing in your
heads to think with."
The committee carried banners
bearing such legends as "Bankers
Favor Wage Cutting; Cut Profits In
stead," and "Morgan Will Follow
Alfonso."
