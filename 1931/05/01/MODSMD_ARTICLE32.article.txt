CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON—
At the Varsity Theatre
Warner Oland, who created that
terror-inspiring character of Fu
Manchu for the screen, is seen in
an opposite role in "Charlie Chan
Carries On," current flicker unreel
ing at the Varsity. Instead of cre
ating mystery, Oland solves one.
Murder, trailing a group of tour
ists around the world and striking
at every port, baffles Scotland Yard.
An inspector who joins the cruise
at London is shot down at Honolulu,
and it remains for a proverb-spout
ing Chinese detective, Charlie Chan,
to "carry on."
The mysterious assailant is not re
vealed until anchor is dropped in
San Francisco bay, creating fair sus
pense. Lacking the finesse of an
S. S. Van Dyne story and the night
mare thrills of the Fu Manchu se
ries, "Charlie Chan" nevertheless
provides an entertaining evening.—

GALLOPING DOWN. By Brainerd
Beckwith. Century. New York,
1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop)
A first novel, "Galloping Down" is
the Struggle of Rory Kilgannon, heir
to the six-hundred-year curse of his
drunken ancestors to overcome, and
live without, the "family cure." His
character battles against his father's,
the magnificently arrogant Michael,
who accepts and almost revels in his
inheritance. In a both win, in
British Columbia, where the wreck
of their Ireland estate has banished
them.
Although there are weaknesses in
the novel, probably through inex
perience, the style and technicalities
of the story are clever. The charac
ters are intensely interesting and

real, and a change from so many
stereotyped 1 hemes now being pub
lished. In addition tq recommending
Brainerd Beckwith, one also feels
that his future novels will attain the
finesse of real literature.

THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. At
the Columbia Theatre. San Fran
cisco
William Thorton's Shylock is a
memorable one. In the trial scene,
which is the finest in the play, from
point of view of acting and the ex
traordinary pitch of dramatic ten
sion attained in this scene, Thorton
displays his greatest pov/er. His
Shylock is a man of intellectual
strength, a man of culture. Most
striking of all is the rare quality of
distinction with which the role is in
vested. Even when Shylock turns to
leave at the end, broken and
crushed, there is a curious, splendid
dignity about his mien.
Thorton stands out immensely
above the rest of the cast. The able
Sherwood Walgamott, playing a mi
nor role with feeling and polish, can
not touch the former.. The part of
Gobbo is brilliantly done, and kept
the audience laughing. Portia was
acted with grace and charm, but one
could not feel that she was really
Shakespeare's Portia. A hint of the
saccharine in this role subtly but
definitely marred its appeal.
Something dynamic and passionate
in the diction, attitudes, and gestures
of Shylock kept one hanging on to
every line of the play, even when
Antonia and Lorenzo were declaim
ing woodenly and stiltedly. The gift
ed feature actor seemed to charge
the whole atmosphdre of the stage
with the intellectual and emotional
vitality of his technique.
