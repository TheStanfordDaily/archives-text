## 
### 
Since their tripod diseappeared on
or near the evening of April 6, the
.astronomy department has been la
boring under great difficulties, ac
cording to Professor S. D. Townley.
In fact, the astronomical activities of
the six students enrolled in Astron
omy 51 have come to a complete
standstill, the professor said.
For sixteen years the astronomy
students have enjoyed moonlit
classes under the stars in a corner
of the Quad near the Mathematics
buildings. This year the students
are confronted with a problem more
serious than that which met the
gunners when their famous "left
hand tree" disappeared.
The combined efforts of all the
scientific minds in the department
have not yet discovered a way of
balancing their five-inch telescope,
and the immediate return of the
tripod is urgently requested.
