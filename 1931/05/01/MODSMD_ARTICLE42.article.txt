Baseball Association in the history!
of the - organization to be won by i
Stanford will be the goal set before
Harry Walter's men when they tan
gle with San Francisco University
tomorrow on the local diamond at
3:30 o'clock.
The Farm will be treated to Stan
ford's best pitcher, when Dan John
son takes the mound against the
Gray Fog outfit. Art Miller will take
Johnson's deliveries behind the plate
for the Cards and should add a con
siderable punch to the batting order.
O'Bay Is Threat
Gene Valla will start his big right
hander O'Day against the Redshirts
oh Saturday. O'Day in his last ap
pearance on the Farm held the slug
ging Indians to a 4-2 score and made
some of 'Harry Wolter's heaviest
hitters seem very tame.
Stanford's infield will offer plenty
of fine baseball to rabid fans of the
nation's pastime who enjoy hard
takes, bullet-like pegs, and rhyth
mic double plays. Errors are rarely
seen in the playing of Hardy, Philip
pi, Cutshaw, and Johnson, who will
compose the infield for tomorrow's
fracas.
