Stanford polo artists clash with
Menlo Circus Club today on their
opponents' field in a game that
should provide some interesting
dope on the way the team, which
has only two of last quarter's first
string, men, w'll function in its first
outside competition.
Present members of the quartet
have excellent stickwork: Gorham
and Fleming, the remaining mem
bers of the last team, are both ex
perienced players and fine horse
men; Lewis, who is a hard rider, and
Bcothe," the longest hitter on the
squad, are the two newcomers to the
first-string four.
The Circus Club has a quantity
of experienced players from which
to draw, and, although their line-up
has not as yet been disclosed, thgy
are expected to give the Indians a
real tussle.
"We should be able to defeat
Menlo, unless they put a more than
six-goal team into the field," said
Captain Gordan, Stanford polo
coach, "the results of the Menlo
game will have an important bear
ing on the manner the team will
function in the important series with
Oregon State at Corvallis in two
weeks."

I The game will start at 2 o'clock.
! The Stanford line-up will be as fol
j lows: Fleming, No. 1, Lev/is, No. 2,
I Gorham, No. 3, and Boothe, No. 4.
