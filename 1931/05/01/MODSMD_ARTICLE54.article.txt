# EL CUADRO DOWNS JAPANESE 8 TO 6 IN CLOSE CONTEST
## Breakers Defeat Delta Chi Nine 12-5 To Break League Tie 
### Francis Hamilton 
El Cuadro continued their winning
streak in intramural baseball by
downing the Japanese Club 8 to 6
yesterday, while Breakers broke a
tie that existed in League I when
they defeated Delta Chi 12 to 5.
Ricklefs and Takesaka, opposing
pitchers in the Cuadro - Japanese
Club contest, were both in excellent
shape, and the game was closely
played. With better support in the
field, Takesaka might easily have
led the Japanese nine to a victory.
El Cuadro Scores
El Cuadro opened the game by
combining a pair of hits with a Jap
anese Club error to score their first
run. The Japanese came back in
their half of the inning to drive two
runs across the plate. Cuadro had
big innings in the third and fifth to
bring their total score up to eight
runs.
Ricklefs held the Japanese Club
hitless for three innings but weak
ened in the fifth to allow two hits
that resulted in a pair of runs. In
the last inning the Japanese rallied
and threatened to tie up the score
but were shut off with two runs
to make the final figures eight to
six in El Cuadro's favor. Ricklefs
and Penn were the El Cuadro bat
tery, Ricklefs striking out 11 men.
Takesaka pitched for the Japanese
Club, with Domto catching.
Breakers Win
Some heavy stickwork combined
with the pitching of Fox won the
game for Breakers. The victors
earned two runs in the first ining,
added five more in a third-inning
attack, four more in the fifth, and
one lone tally in the sixth. Fox was
in trouble only in the third and
fourth innings, where the Delta
Chi's concentrated their scoring.
Batteries were Fox and Oswill-for
Breakers; Pearson and Lyons for
Delta Chi.
Delta Upsilon forfeited their
scheduled game with El Campo.
