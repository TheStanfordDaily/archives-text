# SPANISH MOTIF IS THEME FOR PROM TONIGHT
## Class Festivities Continue At Sports Carnival Here Tomorrow 
### 
Junior celebrations begin tonight
at the annual Junior Prom when the
staid and conservative Pavilion will
find itself turned into a remarkable
semblance of a romantic Spanish
garden.
The decorating committee under
the direction of Art Katsev has in
stalled painted drops and a special
lighting system to heighten the ar
tistic effects. "May Day and a May
Prom" have been the keynote on
which the committee planned the
decorations and the result promises
to make this year's Prom one of the
best dances of its kind on the cam
pus.
Howard's Band
Harold Howard, with his band
composed of college students, is to
provide the music. His "Aristocrats"
have just finished a long engage
ment at the Montmartre Cafe and
are considered one of the most pop
ular orchestra groups on the Pacific
Coast.
Festivities will continue tomorrow
when the Water Sports Carnival will
be held at the Women's Gymnasium.
Novelty races climaxed by the "big
fun" event of the program, the canoe
tilting contests, are destined to give
the audience plenty of laughs.
Bleachers Erected
Bleachers are to be erected around
the pool for spectators and Charlie
Karl, director of the program, has
issued an invitation to any who are
interested. It is expected that a large
crowd will turn out to watch the
sports and especially to see the. div
ing exhibitions.
Pete Desjardins, national title
holder, and Ed Throndson are to
give exhibitions of both plain and
fancy diving. As another unusual
feature of this year's carnival, wom
en will compete in both diving and
swimming events.

winners in the 50- and 100-yard
free-style events. Medley and mixed
relay teams and balloon races will
finish off the competition.
Mrs. Botts, instructor in swim
ming, assisted by Beatrice Clyne, is
arranging the women's entries and
anyone who is interested in compet
ing is asked to communicate with
