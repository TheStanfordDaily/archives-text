# MEET DECIDED CONTEST ENTRY GIVES SHOE SIZE
## 
### 
This college has at least 112
smart young lads who know
how the track meet will turn
out. Far from shy, this ambi
tious group has sent in 112 dif
ferent estimates to the Daily,
each one explaining exactly
where each man will finish in
the race he enters.
One of the demon mathema
ticians was apparently fearful
lest his brain child be relegated
accidentally to the lost and
found column, and so he head
ed his sheet: "Results of the
Stanford-S.C. track meet will
be as follows:". Another one,
filled with confidence, has ap
pended to his estimate the size
of the shoe he likes to wear,
figuring himself as a cinch for
the first prize.
Loathe though he is to admit
it, the sports editor has con
fessed that a few of the dope
sters have gone so far as to
predict that the Trojans will
come out on top of the heap.
