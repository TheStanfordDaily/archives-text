# BOBBY JONES MAY ATTEMPT CAMPUS LINKS NEXT WEEK
## Coach Bennett Hopes That Dutra Will Appear With Georgian 
### 
Stanford sports enthusiasts may
have an early opportunity to see the
world's greatest golfer perform in
their own back yard.
Bobby Jones may very possibly
play an exhibition match on the
Stanford-links next week, according
to Garry Bennett, coach of the var
sity golf squad.
Jones is coming to San Francisco
this week-end to play an exhibition
match for the benefit of the Shriners'
Hospital for Crippled Children Sun
day at the Lakeside course.
Hopes for his Stanford appearance
are based upon his friendship with
Charles Seaver, ace of the freshman
golfing team. During the recent
spring vacation Seaver and Bud Ei
chelberger played with Jones sev
eral times. After hearing them sing
the praises of the Stanford course,
he expressed a wish to play it if he
got the chance. Being in the vicinity,
he now has the chance if he still
has the inclination.
Appearing with Jones in his Lake
side exhibition Sunday is Mortie
Dutra, sensational young profes
sional from Los Angeles. His friend
ship with Garry Bennett and the
reputation of the Stanford course
may induce him to travel down the
peninsula along with Jones to play
here.
