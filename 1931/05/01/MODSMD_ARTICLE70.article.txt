WHAT PRICE ORANGE JUICE?
Several thousand ordinary paid
customers will file into the bleachers
of Stanford's Stadium tomorrow to
watch a titanic struggle between
two of the greatest track and field
teams in the country. They will en
joy themselves thoroughly, win or
lose. Several unpaid customers will
file into a special section reserved
in the very top row of Stanford's
Stadium tomorrow to watch the
same affair. These privileged indi
viduals are usually called news
paper reporters. Late tomorrow af
ternoon, most of them will not be
newspaper reporters. They will be
goats.
<$> <S>
They think they have been set
off from the rest of the gather
ing because of some gift God
gave them in the way of writing
ability. But anyone can see the
real reason. Goats can't be left
to wander at large in an as
semblage of humans, especially
if there are children in the
crowd. And as the long, narrow
shadows, cast upon the green
sward by the setting sun, are
going to even greater lengths,
free sandwiches and orange juice
will be the only consolation for
many, many broken-down, gray
beared old goats.

Tears will flow freely tomorrow
in that special reserved section of
the top row in Stanford's Stadium.
Little drops of salt water will splat
ter on typewriter keyboards and
copy paper. "I doped the glbbrrb
trackbrllbrb meet," these victims
will wail between spasms of bitter
weeping. What a pitiful sight. No
one likes to be a goat. But one must
qualify for the press box. And . . .
free sandwiches with orange juice
. . . well anyway, here goes. We
hereby get off the fence, cross the
bridge, burn it, and stake our life
THAT:

—Stanford will win the track
meet tomorrow. —There will
be more than ten points sepa
rating the Indians and the Tro
jans after the relay has been
run. —When it's all over, Car
dinal Farm hands will finally
wake up and realize that their
worry and sweat wasted these
past few weeks was brought
about by an elusive something
which might be termed "South
ern California psychology."
—Timers down U.S.C. Way are
not especially slow with the stop
watch trigger when recording
performances of Dean Bartlett
Cromwell's athletes. —News
papers in the same vicinity are
not particularly loathe to jprint
what said timers tell them.

—"Hurrying Hector" Dyer will
show his heels to "I Never Lose
Frank" Wykoff in the 220. —Mr.
Wykoff may manage to stay in front
of Dyer in the century, and then
again he might not. —Wykoff is the
only Trojan who will take any
points in the dash events. — If Ben
Eastman runs the 440, he will cross
the line several healthy yards ahead
of Victor Williams. —Williams has
an excellent chance of coming in
third. —Eastman will finish the half
mile, go out and have a cup of cof-
get back in time to greet
his rivals as they cross the line.
d <s> <♦> <♦>
No one is going to take second
place in the mile away from Bob
Brown of Stanford. —It is im
possible for Messrs. Unruh and
Callahan of Troy to take eight
points in the two-mile. —If
Maynor Shove, Les and Ike
Hables, and Ben Eastman run
the relay, Vic Williams will not
have to bother running the last
lap for his badly beaten alma
mater. —Anyone who doped
Cromwell's ex-excellent weight
thrower, Bob Hall, for more than
four points in the shot and dis
cus, might as well give up hope
of winning the pair of shoes.

—Stanford's present sick-list is
grossly exaggerated. —Such will be
demonstrated by A1 Ray, when he
assists Boeger, Zuger, or Rintala in
taking a clean sweep for nine points
in the javelin. —Captain Podge
Smith will cover himself with glory
and about eight points in the two
hurdles races. —The "one-two" fin
ish of Troy's Captain Ernie Payne
and Bill Caids in the low "barriers
will be badly broken up.

—We're a goat now for cer
tain. —Free sandwiches and or
ange juice will taste mighty
good, especially if it's a hot day.
—There will be a new record set
for attendance at dual track
meets in the Stadium. —About
half way through the meet, a
few thousand fans will wish they
had bought two bags of peanuts
instead of one. —Umpty ump
women will ask their noble es
corts who that good-looking fel
low is down there throwing that
man-hole cover, Eric Krenz or
Dink Templeton.
—Crawford.
