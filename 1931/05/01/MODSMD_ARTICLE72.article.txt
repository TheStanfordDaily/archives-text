# Stronger Line May Aid Grid Reckoning
## Indian Squad Laying Foundation for Settlement With Southern California Eleven Next Fall 
### LOWELL COX 
IXTHILE Redshirt trackmen sharpen their spikes in preparation for settling
a year-old score with Southern California tomorrow, another group
of Stanford athletes looks forward to another and long-oredue settlement
with the Trojans. With that 41 to 12 affair of last fall seared on their
memories, 85 Indian gridmen are laying the foundation in spring practice
for what they hope will be their first football victory over U.S.C. since 1926.

> Many Factors Named
Many reasons have been ad
vanced for last year's fiasco. There
are some who say a certain news
paper story broke the spirit of the
Cardinal eleven, at the same time
inspiring the Southerners to a fight
ing pitch. Others attribute the Stan
ford collapse to breaks which gave
U.S.C. an early lead, which on the
basis of previous games, was insur
mountable.
These were undoubtedly contri
buting factors to the size of the
score, but probably the basic reason
for the defeat may be laid at the up
turned feet of the Stanford line.
Outcharging and outplaying the
Cards from the opening whistle, the
Trojan forward wall paved the way
for the lengthy gallops rof Howard
Jones's backs.
Trojan Line Back
With that same powerful line re
turning almost intact to the South
ern institution next fall, it would
appear at first glance that the
chances for an Indian victory next
season are not too bright.
But look again. Returning to the
Stanford fold are Neill and Doub,
ends; G. Grey and Ehrhorn, tackles;
Heiser and Dawson, guards. And
then there are Colvin, Hulen, Hand,
Hunt, N. Gray, Palamountain, and
Laborde for reserve, or possibly
even first-string material..
Card Ends Back
Both "Pop" Warner and "Tiny"
Thornhill, line coach, expect to mold
a forward wall out of this aggrega
tion that will be much stronger than
last year's. The ends are returning,
with another year's experience un
der their belts, and both the guard
and tackle posts should be better
taken care of.
Center is the one position that is
doubtful, with Mar Albertson in
eligible. Warner, however, does not
seem particularly worried. He is ex
perimenting with a number of play
ers at the center position, including
! Kite, Hancock, Marks, Milligan, and
! others, and is confident of finding at
i least two men capable of handling
I the assignment.
Line Crashers Improved
As for line crashers, look for Cap
tain Harry Hillman and Phil Baker
to do plenty of damage to the Tro
jan wall. Both look better than ever
before in spring practice.
Others may be developed into
line plungers, as was Harlow Roth
ert. Caddel hits a hard wallop, and
is heavier than last season, as is
| Rintala. "Dusty" Allen and "Red"
Targhetta, other fullback-quarter
back prospects, are also bad medi
cine for linemen.
While the Trojan line will be no
j weaker next season, Stanford's will
|be considerably stronger. Coupled
j with the fact that the U.S.C. game
j will be played later in the season
; than ever before, an unquestionably
i big advantage for Warner system
: teams, this gives ample reason to
| believe that chances for a reckon
| ing next fall are at least even.

season are not too bright.
But look again. Returning to the
Stanford fold are Neill and Doub,
ends; G. Grey and Ehrhorn, tackles;
Heiser and Dawson, guards. And
then there are Colvin, Hulen, Hand,
Hunt, N. Gray, Palamountain, and
Laborde for reserve, or possibly
even first-string material..
Card Ends Back
Both "Pop" Warner and "Tiny"
Thornhill, line coach, expect to mold
a forward wall out of this aggrega
tion that will be much stronger than
last year's. The ends are returning,
with another year's experience un
der their belts, and both the guard
and tackle posts should be better
taken care of.
Center is the one position that is
doubtful, with Mar Albertson in
eligible. Warner, however, does not
seem particularly worried. He is ex
perimenting with a number of play
ers at the center position, including
! Kite, Hancock, Marks, Milligan, and
! others, and is confident of finding at
i least two men capable of handling
I the assignment.
Line Crashers Improved
As for line crashers, look for Cap
tain Harry Hillman and Phil Baker
to do plenty of damage to the Tro
jan wall. Both look better than ever
before in spring practice.
Others may be developed into
line plungers, as was Harlow Roth
ert. Caddel hits a hard wallop, and
is heavier than last season, as is
| Rintala. "Dusty" Allen and "Red"
Targhetta, other fullback-quarter
back prospects, are also bad medi
cine for linemen.
While the Trojan line will be no
j weaker next season, Stanford's will
|be considerably stronger. Coupled
j with the fact that the U.S.C. game
j will be played later in the season
; than ever before, an unquestionably
i big advantage for Warner system
: teams, this gives ample reason to
| believe that chances for a reckon
| ing next fall are at least even.
IXTHILE Redshirt trackmen sharpen their spikes in preparation for settling
a year-old score with Southern California tomorrow, another group
of Stanford athletes looks forward to another and long-oredue settlement
with the Trojans. With that 41 to 12 affair of last fall seared on their
memories, 85 Indian gridmen are laying the foundation in spring practice
for what they hope will be their first football victory over U.S.C. since 1926.

> Many Factors Named
Many reasons have been ad
vanced for last year's fiasco. There
are some who say a certain news
paper story broke the spirit of the
Cardinal eleven, at the same time
inspiring the Southerners to a fight
ing pitch. Others attribute the Stan
ford collapse to breaks which gave
U.S.C. an early lead, which on the
basis of previous games, was insur
mountable.
These were undoubtedly contri
buting factors to the size of the
score, but probably the basic reason
for the defeat may be laid at the up
turned feet of the Stanford line.
Outcharging and outplaying the
Cards from the opening whistle, the
Trojan forward wall paved the way
for the lengthy gallops rof Howard
Jones's backs.
Trojan Line Back
With that same powerful line re
turning almost intact to the South
ern institution next fall, it would
appear at first glance that the
chances for an Indian victory next
season are not too bright.
