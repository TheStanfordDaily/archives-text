# MacNaughton Takes Match
## Jerry Trautman Eliminated In Quarter-Finals 
### 
Malcolm- MacNaughton, holder of
the California intercollegiate title,
yesterday reached the semi-finals of
the University golf championship,
stroking his way to a 2 and 1 vic
tory over Jerry Trautman.
Play was not spectacular, but was
featured by Trautman's fine putting
and MacNaughton's long drives. The
latter made a particularly long shot
from the fifth tee. Trautman carried
the match to the seventeenth green
in spite of twice getting into trouble.
MacNaughton will meet Herman
Hellman in the semi-finals, whom he
is expected to eliminate without dif
ficulty.

Lawson Little, recent winner of
the Northern California amateur
crown, has yet to play, his quarter
final match with Gene Brown. The
latter has defeated Little, but is not
expected to duplicate the feat. The
winner of the match will meet Char
lie Seaver, first ranking man of the
famous frosh triumvirate.
