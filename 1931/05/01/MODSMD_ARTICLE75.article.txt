# EDUCATION SOCIETY HEARS LECTURE ON CREATIVE LEARNING
## 
### 
The chief defect of the public
school system, according to Mrs.
Frank B. Duveneck, who spoke at
a meeting of Pi Lambda Theta yes
terday afternoon, is that it does not
create sufficient situations to form
an adequate background for the
child.
ThÂ«r topic of Mrs. Duveneck, v/ho
is the principal of the Peninsula
School of Creative Education, was
"Creative Education." She spoke of
her work in her school, which has
been running for six years and has
the chief aim of giving the child
complete freedom of development.
Her purpose was to study the weak
nesses and strength of each child
and to direct his development
along the lines of his interests and
capabilities.
