# GLENDON, MENTOR OF FAMOUS CREWS, TELLS OF SQUADS
## Coach Says Great Teams Come Along Once In A Lifetime 
### 
NEW YORK, April 30 (/P).—On
the walls of Rich Glendon's room on
the second floor of the New Colonial
boathouse of Columbia University,
down on the Harlem river flats un
der the towering stands of Baker
Field, are the pictures of all the
eight-oared crews he has coached.
All of them are identified in his
handwriting such as "1924, Navy,"
"1928, Columbia." On only three of
them is there any further inscription.
His eyes brighten when you point
to any of those.
Inscriptions on Wall
On the picture of the 1925 Navy
crew, undefeated and victorious at
Poughkeepsie, is the inscription, "a
great boatload," and on the picture
of the 1929 Columbia varsity, also
Poughkeepsie victors and undefeat
ed through the year, "a great crew."
Turning around in his chair and
squinting through the sun, pouring
in through the west windows at his
back, Glendon shook his head.
"Crews like those fellows only
come along once in a life-time," he
said. "I hate to think how good they
really were. How those boys could
row. Well," he sighed and found an
easier position in his chair, "this is
another year."
Lives in Boathouse
In the big lounging room, which,
with his room and that of his broth
er, occupies the whole second floor
of the boathouse, are carved the
names of all of Columbia's crews
since 1873, when the first boatload
was sent out to battle for the Blue
and White.
Cut deeply into the wooden panel
are the names of that now almost
forgotten first crew: C. Der. Moore;
bow, O. D. Smith, A. B. Simonds, E.
S. Rapello, R. C. Cornell, B. F. Rees,
stroke. Only six men in those days.
Alongside it is the roster of the # 1930
eight, completing the record of 57
years of rowing.
