# LACK OF INTERCOLLEGIATE COMPETITION FOR FAIR SEX IS DECRIED BY LAIDLAW

Mills College, traditional rival of
the "500" in the affairs of the Stan
ford rough, may get a chance to
continue the rivalry on Stanford
tennis courts, replacing strains of
dance music by the rhythmic crack
of racquets.
Intercollegiate varsity competition,
long-hoped-for to raise the lagging
banner of women's sports, offers no
insurmountable barrier, in the opin
ion of Gertrude Laidlaw, Cardinal
women's sports head.
Two obstacles in the way of wo
men's varsity competition lie, first,
in the passivity of the colleges who
favor it, and second, in the attitude
of the American Conference of As
sociated College Women, which bars
it.
According to A.C.A.C.W., varsity
competition would lower the morale
of women's sports, "commercialize"
it on a par with men's athletics, and
incite the gentler players into striv-

ing beyond the bounds of feminine
endurance.
Center-retorts of the women en
thusiasts, with whom Miss Laidlaw
agrees, declare that competition will
add a necessary spice to their sports,
and that the bogey-man, commer
cialism, does not enter the question,
since no large gate receipts are at
stake, and expense is negligible.
As for the danger of undue strain
on the part of antagonistic teams,
the players' common sense, and the
supervision of coach and trainer ef
fectively destroy this hazard. No
such liability exists in men's ath
letics, Miss Laidlaw points out. On
the contrary, training rules and rou
tine are tremendously beneficial.
"With Stanford to take the initia
tive, Mills will probably be alert to
follow our break with the confer
ence, and the fresh interest of var
sity competition will triumph," says
Miss Laidlaw.
