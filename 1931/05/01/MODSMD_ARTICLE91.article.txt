## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30. (JP) â€”
An end of the formal but pictur
esque courtesies between the heads
of an ancient and a modern state
came late today when the King and
Queen of Siam had President and
Mrs. Hoover as tea guests.
The King and Queen depart to
morrow for New York. They will
resume their incognitos as the train
leaves Washington.
The President and Mrs. Hoover
left their car in the court at the
great stone mansion on' Massachu
setts avenue where the royal visi
tors are stopping. White House aides
preceded them as they were es
corted to the room where King Pra
jadhipok and Queen Darni were
waiting.
State Department officials said it
was the first time a President and
First Lady had been entertained in
Washington by the rulers of another
state .The program for Queen Marie
of Rumania in 1926 followed closely
the schedule for the Siamese Mon
archs but the tea was lacking.
