# "DANCE OF DEATH" WILL BE GERMAN CLUB PRODUCTION
## Peter Vellenga Is Picked To Play Important Leading Role 
### 
Peter Vellenga has been chosen
j to portray the part of Death, the
| lead, in the German Club produe
j tion, "Ein Totentanz," or the 'Dance
| of Death," that is to be presented in
the Little Theatre on May 7.
The story concerns the progress
of Death through the world, leaving
destruction in his path. Although
| the dialogue is in German, the play
; will be of interest to everyone, and
j a synopsis will be furnished in the
; program.

The production of "Ein Totentanz"
is under the direction of Dr. Kurt F.
Reinhardt, professor of German, who
will read "The Voice of the Lord."
The play is based on the motif of
| the medieval miracle play and is
also a treatment of the subject mat
ter of the famous woodcuts by Hans
! Holbein.
Western drama has its basis in
this type of production. The miracle
| play developed in close contact with
I Christian liturgy, and was originally
performed in churches. The play
| "Everyman" and the "Dance of
Death" are based on similar back
ground, both being modern produc
tions of a new renaissance in Ger
j many called the German Youth
I Movement.

Other members of the cast are:
Karl Falk, Joseph Ponti, Cris Car
stensen, Jane Townlqy, Louise Dohr
mann, Dorothy Ulrici, and Henry
Kleinbach.

A "truth serum," said to be so po
tent that under its influence the
glibbest liar will "tell all" is being
experimented with by scientists at
the crime detecting laboratory .of
Northwestern University.
