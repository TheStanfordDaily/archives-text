# PORTUGUESE FORCE CONTINUES ATTACK ON REBEL GARRISON
## 
### 
LISBON, Portugal, April 30 (-flP). â€”
Failing in all attempts at a peaceful
surrender, the government expedi
tionary force today resumed its at
tack on the rebellious garrison at
Funchal, Madeira, by land, by air,
and by sea.
Warships in the Portuguese ar
mada opened a heavy bombardment
on the city, hurling shells into the
most populuos sections. Seaplanes
dropped ombs in support. Three de
tachments of infantry were reported
landed at Machico, 15 miles north
east of Funchal.
It was believed casualties must
have occurred among the civilian
population in the city since messages
from the expedition speak of a few
shells as having fallen in "populous
quarters." It was assumed that re
maining foreigners were safe since
they have been moved to a "neutral
zone," formed by two large Hotels.
