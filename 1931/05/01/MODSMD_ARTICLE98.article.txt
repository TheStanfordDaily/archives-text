# BORAH SOUNDS NOTE OF U.S. INEFFICIENCY
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30.
The people have been told by Sena
tor Borah that the federal govern
ment is approaching "the most
wasteful, th most demoralizing, and
most inefficient form" yet conceived.
This statement the Idaho Repub
lican made yesterday to answer
President Hoover's recent assertion
that no tax increase would be ne
cessary if Congress kept expendi
tures within budget recommenda
tions.
