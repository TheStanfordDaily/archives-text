# NEW REBELLION THREAT ROCKS CHIANG REGIME
## Conservative Party Charges Government Head With Abuse Of Power CHINA REVOLT LOOMS Two States Separate From Nanking Control

SHANGHAI, May 4 (Monday)
(/IV With both its domestic soli
darity and foreign relations appar
ently facing issues gravely endan
gering its existence, China's Nation
alist government today was in the
most precarious position encoun
tered since the rebllion of the north
ern war lords last year.
Domestically a considerable por
tion of the conservative elements of
the Kuomintang, which controls die
Nationalist government, accused
Chiang Kai-Shek, the party and
government leader, of abuse of his
power, inefficiency in handling the
government's multifarious problems,
and demanded that he retire.
Two States Revolt
Bringing their influence to bear,
the Conservatists, in order to get
their anti-Chiang Kai-Shek drive
under way, caused the Kwangtung
and Kwangsi Province leaders, who
are principally appointees of Chiang,
to declare independence in those
provinces and accuse their supposed
chieftain of aspirations inimical to
the interests of the revolutionary
government and demand his over
throw.
Kuomintang conservatives, who
are carefully remaining behind the
scenes, today prophesied their move
ment was destined to spread
throughout the nation, if the gener
alissimo declines to heed the "real
voice of the Kuomintang and the
nation."
Rumor Mobilization
Whether or not the drive is des
tined to become more serious, pos
sibly plunging the country into a
renewed civil war, if the generalis
simo persists in declining to retire,
is not yet evident.
That portion of the Kuomintang
supporting Chiang Kai-Shek con
tinued loudly to proclaim the move
ment unimportant and destined to be
ijuickly quashed. Simultaneously ru
mors that the opposing factions were
undertaking to inaugurate a mobili
zation of all possible military
strength in various parts of the
jountry were widely circulated.
