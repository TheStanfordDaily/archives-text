# Indian Track Team Given 69-62 Beating By Cromwell's Men
## U.S.C. Triumphs in Mile, Javelin, Century Sound Early Knell to Cardinal Hopes; Stanford Relay Team Sets New American Record 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
JT took only the first three events to prove to some twenty thousand
fans fathered in the Stadium Saturday afternoon that Southern
California's track and field team still has an "Indian sign" 011 Stanford.
Confident that Dink Teinpleton's athletes would reverse last year's dual
meet decision, supporters of the Cardinal cause looked on with a feeling
I of fading security as McKcnzie of Troy tossed the javelin out 191 feet 2'i>
inches on his second throw, as Halstead galloped to a healthy victory in
the mile run, and as Delby sneaked into third place in the century while

j WykofT was taking the measure of
i Hec Dyer by more than a yard.
Hall Upsets Dope
i The dope bucket, giving the In
dians a clean-cut triumph on a basis
jof past performances, was tossed
clear out of the Stadium by Hall's
j second place in the shot and third
; in the discus, by Selby's third in the
' broad jump, by McKenzie's first,
and by Delby's two points in the
I sprints and Woessner's quarter-mile
j digit.
Except for the winning spear
j throw, the Trojan trackmen did not
display unexpected power. They
| simply came through under the
| strain of hot competition while red
; shirted participants fell below their
• capabilities. Result: 69-62.
Great Mile Relay
Today, why it happened and not
how, becomes the question, since the
i meet itself is an old story. For con
j solation, Farm enthusiasts have Hec
I Dyer's beautiful finish in both dash
i es, in the 220 to cross the line a foot
j ahead of the favox-ed "Glendale
| flash," and in the century to nose
' out Delby for second after the
| world's worst start.
A privileged throng it was that
witnessed probably the greatest mile
j relay race ever staged. Historians of
i track can tell you that never before
have an yfour men negotiated a mile
jin 3:14.3 while another quartet
I threatened every inch of the way
| with something like 3:14.7. Both
j teams beat Stanford's old American
I record of 3:15.4.
Shove Helps
Shove's five-yard advantage over
Dow of S.C. in the first lap decided
that the record would go to Stan
j ford instead of Troy. Ike and Les
I Hables looked beautiful in dropping
| a couple of yards, and Ben Eastman,
I after having run just 440 yards far
ther than Vic Williams earlier in
! the afternoon, held off the Trojan's
determined bid as the pair came off

; the final turn, to win by the three
i yard advantage he had held when
j he grabbed the baton from Hables.
Captain Podge Smith proved onqc
[and for all that he is the coast's
best high hurdler, while Nisbet look
' an unexpected second, and then up
, held the Cardinal low hurdles bur
den by breaking up the one-two
finish of S. C.'s stellar pair, Captain
Ernie Payne and Bill Carls. Smith
hurt a muscle after taking a couple
of low barriers and was unable to
; stay in the running.
Brown and Aebersold came
through, not only annexing their al
lotted seconds in the distance races,
but battling each Rt-d and Gold fa
vorite all the way to the finish.
