# Moderate Drinkers More Danger In Traffic-King

### 
j LOS ANGELES, May 3. —In a I
study of the "Psychology of Drunk- j
enness," Professor Albion R. King,
of the department of philosophy,
University of Southern California,
says he has found that the moder
ate drinker of intoxicants is a great
er menace in automobile traffic than
! one who is drunk.
"In the early stages of intoxica
tion," Professor King says, "an au
tomobile driver may be able to co
l ordinate his muscular activities
fairly well but he is impulsive and !
reckless and so takes the deadly •
chance. He thinks he can drive as ;
well as ever. And so, in a large i
degree, he can so far as movements !
of hand and foot are concerned. Bui !
the <a>und, careful judgment that
directs hand and I'nut are gone and ;

! in its place reigns impulse, rash and
I unrestrained.
. "Few men will attempt to drive at
all when they are drunk enough to
realize that they are drunk. It is
the man who is just drunk enough
to think he is all right and to snap
his fingers in the face of caution
who is the great menace on the high
ways.
"And the danger is increased by
the additional fact that alcohol al
ways slows down muscular reac
tions. If it takes one second of time
for a certain person to perform a
! simple muscular response, such as
I to take his foot off the accelerator
and put it on the brake, and one
bottle of beer slows his reaction one
fifth of a second, it makes a great
difference in the chances of the
