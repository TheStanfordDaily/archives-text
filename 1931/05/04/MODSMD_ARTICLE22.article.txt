### 
WASHINGTON, May 3
iness minds from the world over
have gathered in Washington to
for economic rehabilitation at
this week's meeting of the Interna
tional Chamber of Commerce.
President Hoover will give his
views to the more than 1000 dele
gates from 46 nations at the opening
session tomorrow morning. Discus
sions will be held daily through Sat
urday, under the guidance of George
Theunis, former Belgian premier
and retiring president of the inter
national chamber.
Will Analyze Crisis
Causes and effects of "the business
crisis" will be analyzed by M. Theu
nis immediately after Mr. Hoover's
address. His report, based on in
formation from the national commit
tees of the various countries, also
will propose possible remedies to
hasten a return to normal business.
Fresh from the convention of the
United States Chamber of Commerce
meeting at Atlantic City, some 600
American business men will be on
hand. They are headed by Silas H.
Strawn, Chicago, chairman of the
American committee for the world
organization.
Delegates Study Program
Details of the comprehensive pro
gram which will engage them were
studied informally today by various
delegations. There was no agree
ment, however, on just what course
the discussions will take on such
controversial questions as tariff bar
riers, war debt payments to this
country, and trade between capital
istic nations and soviet Russia.
The Foreign Policy Association re
port, prepared by Professor James
W. Angell of Columbia University,
said a long continuance of world
wide business dullness may force
this country to reconsider the whole
debt question. What views speakers
at the meeting will take was not
known, but it was known the Hoo
ver administration at present has no
intention of altering its insistence on
the present agreements \for pay
ments from abroad.
