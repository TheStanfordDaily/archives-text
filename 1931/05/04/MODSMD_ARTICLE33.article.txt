Today begins tbe annual Convalescent Ibyne Drive, to
ward the lO.'Jl goal of $1000. That this charity is a worthy
one is never disputed, but in the ordinary course of events
ii) each quarter few I niversily students give it much
thought. The freshmen who learn where the Home is soon
after moving into Eneina forget about it when they return
to the campus as sophomores.
But at the Convalescent Home, the work of rehabili
tating undernourished and sickly bodies continues, every
day. That work cannot be done as fully as it should be
done without student support. Part of the Convalescent
Home plant is at present unoccupied and out of service
simply because not enough money is available. At the
same time, there are many children in need of the aid given
by the home.
It takes $2.50 to care for one child for a single day.
Whether you can give the money to take care of a child
for a day or two, or feel you can only give him a couple of
meals, your support will help. And if you can spare the
time on Wednesday to wash a few windows or chop some
wood, do that, too. Perhaps you've forgotten about the
Convalescent Home; maybe you haven't been there this
this year. It is part of the campus, you know, and shares
in'the Stanford tradition. The first appeal is this morning,
and until the barbecue tires die out Wednesday night,
you'll be exepecled there.
