A splendid example of petty, misguided, and narrow
minded patriotism, ii' it can be called such, was revealed
last week in a decision handed down by the president and
fellows of Harvard College concerning the War Memorial
Chapel to be constructed in Cambridge. They ruled that
they could not include the names of the three Harvard meTi
who died fighting on the side of the Central Powers in the
new Harvard Memorial.
Ready indignation at this action was expressed bv the
llavvurd C.rirnson, whose editor declared: "If the Chapel
i." to act as a memorial to Harvard men it must of necessity
include all Harvard men who died in the last war. It is not
a question of nationality or of patriotism; it is more nearly
a question of principle. Those men who died for Germany
were also, to I lie (Diversity, Harvard men. Tljev should
not be disow ned because of differing affections. Nor does
their small number invalidate this premise. Those three
are as much alflmni of Harvard as the who fought and
(iied for the Allies. Their allegiance to her was as great.
To exclude them would be an insult upon men w ho died in
pursuit of their duty as they conceived it.
"Beyond this the decision produces another anomaly.
If the alumni are to have a chapel, let them construct and
dedicate one that will obey and maintain the precepts upon
which such institutions are founded. To exclude these
three would be to endow God with a purely local patriot
ism, a thing which has ever been foreign to Christian be
liefs. In less these men of Harvard are included the struc
ture will fail in iis purpose both as a memorial and as a
chapel. Harvard men will be thought only worthy of re
membrance if they are Americans, and God will be asso
ciated only with the strongest battalions."
There can be only one response to the Harvard action,
and the C.rimson hns given it, indignantly. That the bitter
ness and the patriotism of war days should engender na
tionalism is understandable, but that it should persist after
more than a decade of peace is hard to comprehend. Rabid
and narrow nationalism, such as is evidenced in the Memo
rial Chapel decision, can be least condoned in a university
supposedly characterized by rationalism and intelligence
as is Harvard.
