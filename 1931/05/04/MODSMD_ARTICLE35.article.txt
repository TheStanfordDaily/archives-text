W*iHi the collegiate track classic a thing of llic past,
Stanford students can find some consolation among tlie
echoes of the recent track and field meets. First and fore
most is the realization that only one quartet of quarter
inilers has ever passed the baton about more speedily than
Stanford's own did last Saturday; then too Hector Dyer
has yet to be defeated in an intercollegiate 220; and lastly,
a new high-score record was hung up this year at the ex
pense of California's almost extinct Golden Hear. The cal
endar of cinder clashes has not yet run its course, either.
The Fresno Helays, the California Intercollegiate meet in
l.os Angeles, and the I.C.A.A.A.A. encounter are yet to
come, and much may happen in them.
