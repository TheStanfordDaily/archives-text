# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Ever .since certain senators of
questionable broadness of mind—

and ever since certain newspapers
possessed of "ballyhoo" instincts—
began condemning the League of
Nations, people who wished to be
classed us intelligent hesitated to
side with these forces and declare
their antipathy to the League. One
, feared to be branded a "provincial"

a "reactionary"—and consequently
one was quite apt to be "interna
tionally minded," to drop prejudices
these carriers of the new gospel
claimed we had, and endorse the
League of Nations.

By this time, it is evident that the
Bull Session does not favor this
country's joining the League. In
taking such a stand, we are not con
demning the League; it is an excel
lent thing for Europe. But what can
be soup for Europe, may just be a
hot pan for vis. We do not claim that
the United States can isolate itsell
from the rest of the world; but in -
cause we cannot shut ourselves off
from the rest of the world is no
reason for diving headlong into that
which we find impossible to com
pletely stay clear of.

The League is primarily a means
of settling European disputes, not
because it has a prejudice against
disputes in other parts of the world;
but because most international con
troversies involve European powers.
We—that is, our Marine Corps—
have plenty to do to keep peace in
this hemisphere; we have had our
chin sufficiently bruised in Nica
ragua and other places without
courting wider fields of activity.
But this is a narrow outlook,
claims the idealist. It seems only
logical, say some, that our economi
cal relations compass the world and
hence that we must follow with
some kind of international political
organization. The big difference is

(hat no one has prejudices against
Soviet rubles, or Fascist lire, or Ger
man marks—we accept all with lov
ing kindness and fond Embrace. But
when we deal with political systems,
social organizations, and national
characteristics, we find a series and
cross-series of interwoven hates,
fears, and prejudices. Europe may
be able to solve these problems by
the League; if so, that is excellent.
But in solving them, Europe will
probably have economic or military
wars.

It is to keep out of these wars that
America should stay out of the
League. While it is true, there is
nothing in the League Covenant that
would force us to war, mere asso
ciation with European nations would
place us under obligation to fight.
By joining this concert of powers,
wo are associating ourselves with
the "European System," and as part
of that system, we would be under
moral—if not legal—obligation to
bear our part. It may be selfish but
it is highly desirable that the Amer
ican citizen feel that if Italy chooses
to ravage weak Jugoslavia, or if the
Russian bear goes "bearing" around
—it is none of our concern.

We should have learned in the
last war the futility of trying to
avenge international "moral wrongs."
If Germany had won the war, the
German eagle would have domi
nated Europe; now the French fleur
de-lis does. What actual difference
does it make to us? We were
burned to the tune of some 70,000
men and many more millions of dol
lars to make the "world safe for
democracy." Now we find the dic
tatorship of the proletariat in Rus
sia, Mussolini's iron hand in Italy,
Kemal attempting a similar policy
in Turkey, nobody ruling in France,
and Hitler trying to run things in
Germany. Did it all pay?

Ever .since certain senators of
questionable broadness of mind—

and ever since certain newspapers
possessed of "ballyhoo" instincts—
began condemning the League of
Nations, people who wished to be
classed us intelligent hesitated to
side with these forces and declare
their antipathy to the League. One
, feared to be branded a "provincial"

a "reactionary"—and consequently
one was quite apt to be "interna
tionally minded," to drop prejudices
these carriers of the new gospel
claimed we had, and endorse the
League of Nations.

By this time, it is evident that the
Bull Session does not favor this
country's joining the League. In
taking such a stand, we are not con
demning the League; it is an excel
lent thing for Europe. But what can
be soup for Europe, may just be a
hot pan for vis. We do not claim that
the United States can isolate itsell
from the rest of the world; but in -
cause we cannot shut ourselves off
from the rest of the world is no
reason for diving headlong into that
which we find impossible to com
pletely stay clear of.

The League is primarily a means
of settling European disputes, not
because it has a prejudice against
disputes in other parts of the world;
but because most international con
troversies involve European powers.
We—that is, our Marine Corps—
have plenty to do to keep peace in
this hemisphere; we have had our
chin sufficiently bruised in Nica
ragua and other places without
courting wider fields of activity.
But this is a narrow outlook,
claims the idealist. It seems only
logical, say some, that our economi
cal relations compass the world and
hence that we must follow with
some kind of international political
organization. The big difference is

(hat no one has prejudices against
Soviet rubles, or Fascist lire, or Ger
man marks—we accept all with lov
ing kindness and fond Embrace. But
when we deal with political systems,
social organizations, and national
characteristics, we find a series and
cross-series of interwoven hates,
fears, and prejudices. Europe may
be able to solve these problems by
the League; if so, that is excellent.
But in solving them, Europe will
probably have economic or military
wars.

It is to keep out of these wars that
America should stay out of the
League. While it is true, there is
nothing in the League Covenant that
would force us to war, mere asso
ciation with European nations would
place us under obligation to fight.
By joining this concert of powers,
wo are associating ourselves with
the "European System," and as part
of that system, we would be under
moral—if not legal—obligation to
bear our part. It may be selfish but
it is highly desirable that the Amer
ican citizen feel that if Italy chooses
to ravage weak Jugoslavia, or if the
Russian bear goes "bearing" around
—it is none of our concern.
