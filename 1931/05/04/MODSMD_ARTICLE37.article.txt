LONELY WIVES—At the Varsity ,
Theatre.
Edward Everett Horton, and his
inimitable gift for comedy, have j
made a picture out of "Lonely !
Wives" that just about warrants the
epithet "gayest comedy of the year."
As a lawyer, whose business hours j
last until 8 o'clock only, he proceeds !
to enjoy himself in spite of his trust- j
ing mother-in-law. With the help i
of *an impersonator, a secretary, a !
divorce-seeking wife, and an under- |
standing butler, situations arise |
which in themselves are a little i
trite, but which are made funny by i
good dialogue.
Although m\c would like to shoot ,
the "pitter-pattering" mother-in- :
law, since it is comedy she is allowed 1
to live, probably making Horton J
worthy of her trust. —J.N.

I CITY STREETS—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Gary Cooper is the latest to join
j the gangsters and "beer barons." He
! can't ride horse any more, but he
j can shoot still and that is an asset
j in a gang picture. Gary does very
well in limousines and fur-collared
coast, too.
The picture is in the usual man
ner, with variations that almost
make one forget the well-worn
theme. Then it is always exciting
to see people put on the spot or
i taken for a ride.
The cast is remarkably good.
) There is Gary, and Paul Lukas, and
j ParanKjunt's new star, Sylvia Sid
ney. She took Clara Bow's place in
1 "City Streets" and is a big improve-
I mcnts. Besides, she's easy to look at
j and can act. —N.J.
