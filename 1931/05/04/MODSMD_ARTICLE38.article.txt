Sixty-nine and sixty-two. Sounds
like a problem in the square root of
triangle sports dtfy, or something.
The seven points means simply that
the S.C. side of the stadium was
seven degrees warmer than ours.
They really should have some
credit, though, because they did
n't have a red-coat band to cheer
them on to victory. The fife and
drum corps was cheerful, any
how, Piccolo Pete having finally
given way to the Trombone
Troubadour, so that the whole
thing sounds less like the Ladies'
Aid and more like college as
pictured by Buddy Rogerses, at
."»<> cents a night.

Say what you wilt, we're pretty
proud of all the boys who went out
and threw things around, all after
noon. The best part is the charac
teristics they develop, during a year.
If one man didn't trip on one hurdle,
if another one failed to put that all
important penny in the toe of his
shoe, if the pole vaulters didn't al
ways make two unsuccessful trys,

| each round, just to fool the opposi
| tion, it wouldn't be Stanford.
As somebody's sister suggest
ed, it really would be much
nicer if the 440 and BXO men, for
instance, would spread out more
on the track and give the others
more of a fair chance. Yes, what
is beer, father?

Monsieur Jesjardins certainly
| managed himself in beautiful style,
Saturday morning. Maybe there's
; something besides mud-baths in the
life of a water-fowl, after all. At any
1 rate, the water carnival was
achieved without more rain. Heaven,
the 8.A.C., and 1932 stop at nothing
I but cement gate-posts.
All of which reminds us that
midquarters arc upon us, and
someone said something about
that once, like this:
"Why do you call this little
blue card a smoke-up?"
"Because 1 got it in a pipe."—
i (Joke.)
