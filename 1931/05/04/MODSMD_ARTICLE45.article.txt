Right Reverend Edward Lambe
; Parsons, Episcopalian Bishop of
j California, delivered the sermon yes
terday in the Memorial Church.
Parsons traced the path of Truth
I through the ages, as manifested in
the growth of scientific understand

in mortality due to Science. Then
1 the Bishop explained his conception
of Truth as a virtue of which every-
