Dry the tears, brethren, it's
all over now. Anion# the post
mortems that inevitably Wlloiv
a meet such as Saturday's, re
main more than the usual num
ber of "ifs," '"ands," and "buts."
Excuses and alibis will fill the
sports columns of no small num
ber of newspapers hereabouts as
scribes who were made "goals"
by the outcome try to right
themselves with the poor, mis
guided public.

The very fact that most every
body was wrong is in itself an ex
planation of the triumph of Troy.
More than just cold figures must be
/eekoned in doping any athletic con
test. Those other things, however, '
are not available to any one man. I
They include the temperament of
each competing athlete, his physical
condition, and his innermost thoughts
while performing his special duty.
All that can be said is that i
the Trojans won the track meet,
won it because they could race
laster, throw farther, ami jump !
higher on that particular day
under those particular condi
tions. That's an old story, but
(rue, nevertheless.
At le ast two races were spoiled by [
uniortunate cii'cumstances, aided
and abetted by inefficiency on the |
part of certain officials. The start j
of the century was undoubtedly the I
poorest that ever got the recall gun j
in a first-class track meet. Giberson j
of Stanford and Delby of U.S.C. '
were off away ahead of the pack, j
Wykoff started fairly, right with the j
gun. Hec Dyer, however, started
late, paused in anticipation of the I
recall gun, and then from last posi- j
tion lit out to finish in one of the !
fastest sprints we have ever seen. j

That debacle occuring on the
final turn «»i" the quarter-mile,
as far as official results were '
concerned, was totally ignored.
Everyone who witnessed the re
gretlable affair will testify that
Vic Williams shoved llables,
something which constitutes a
foul in anything claiming rela
tion to a track meet. But the
more observing noticed that
Williams not only pushed Les,
but elbowed him in the region
of his sore appendix. Shove was
also a recipient of a dig in the
side as the Southern star
muscled through the perfectly
legal box in which he found
himself.
A Mr. Spicer, brought up from
Southern California to help with the
jfficiating, was the judge stationed
in that turn. He actually wanted to
lisqualify Les for being out in front
<1 Williams when the latter started
lis sprint at the finish. Mr. Spicer,
t seems, later admitted to Dink
rempleton that he was not a quali
ied A.A.U. official, and that he had
lot received special sanction io
vork in Saturday's meet. Dink right
ully entered an official protest
igainst the judge and his decision
m the very apparent foul.

This man McKenzie deserves
a lot of credit for the victory.
Having thrown the spear 'only
IS(> feet on his best effort in
previous competition, he went
out (here Saturday to send Ins
first toss IXK feet. Most of Mc-
Kenzie's remaining throws were
beyond the 190-foot mark.

Could Ben Eastman beat Vic Wil
iarns in ;i quarter-mile if both men !
lad no other race to think About on
he same afternoon? That question
/ent unanswered Saturday, but we ;
re of the opinion that he could.
Jen held his advantage over the j
v.A.U. champion in the last relay \
>p, but it must be remembered that j
lastman had run just one more lap i
ban Vic earlier in the afternoon. '

Everyone who witnessed the re
gretlable affair will testify that
Vic Williams shoved llables,
something which constitutes a
foul in anything claiming rela
tion to a track meet. But the
more observing noticed that
Williams not only pushed Les,
but elbowed him in the region
of his sore appendix. Shove was
also a recipient of a dig in the
side as the Southern star
muscled through the perfectly
legal box in which he found
himself.
A Mr. Spicer, brought up from
Southern California to help with the
jfficiating, was the judge stationed
in that turn. He actually wanted to
lisqualify Les for being out in front
<1 Williams when the latter started
lis sprint at the finish. Mr. Spicer,
t seems, later admitted to Dink
rempleton that he was not a quali
ied A.A.U. official, and that he had
lot received special sanction io
vork in Saturday's meet. Dink right
ully entered an official protest
igainst the judge and his decision
m the very apparent foul.

This man McKenzie deserves
a lot of credit for the victory.
Having thrown the spear 'only
IS(> feet on his best effort in
previous competition, he went
out (here Saturday to send Ins
first toss IXK feet. Most of Mc-
Kenzie's remaining throws were
beyond the 190-foot mark.

Could Ben Eastman beat Vic Wil
iarns in ;i quarter-mile if both men !

Dry the tears, brethren, it's
all over now. Anion# the post
mortems that inevitably Wlloiv
a meet such as Saturday's, re
main more than the usual num
ber of "ifs," '"ands," and "buts."
Excuses and alibis will fill the
sports columns of no small num
ber of newspapers hereabouts as
scribes who were made "goals"
by the outcome try to right
themselves with the poor, mis
guided public.

The very fact that most every
body was wrong is in itself an ex
planation of the triumph of Troy.
More than just cold figures must be
/eekoned in doping any athletic con
test. Those other things, however, '
are not available to any one man. I
They include the temperament of
each competing athlete, his physical
condition, and his innermost thoughts
while performing his special duty.
All that can be said is that i
the Trojans won the track meet,
won it because they could race
laster, throw farther, ami jump !
higher on that particular day
under those particular condi
tions. That's an old story, but
(rue, nevertheless.
At le ast two races were spoiled by [
uniortunate cii'cumstances, aided

Wykoff started fairly, right with the j
