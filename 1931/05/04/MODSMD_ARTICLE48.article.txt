# Stanford Nine Captures First Conference Title
## CURDS TRIM GRAY FOG OUTFIT 10-3; JOHNSON PITCHES Victory Cinched In 'Lucky' Fifth; Four Regulars Play Last Game 
### Francis Lloyd 
j Gaining their first California In-
I tercollegiate Baseball Association
j championship in the history of Stan-
I lord, the Cards trounced the San
l Francisco University nine; 10-3, here
| Saturday. Without appearing to
| work too hard, Dan Johnson chalked
j up his ninth victory of the season
| while exhibiting a brand of pitching
i that marks him as the conference's
j best hurler.
The Eedshirts. holding a 3-2 lead,
treated themselves to a truly obese
inning in the fifth by scoring six
runs and thereby nailed the pennant
to the flagpole. To little Art Miller,
Stanford catcher, went the credit for
turning in the most spectacular play
of the day. The Indian backstop
j snatched a high foul a bare two feet
I from the stands, and won the ap
| plause of the crowd.
Hunken Scintillates
; Maintaining throughout the sea-
I son the fire and enthusiasm which
j did much to bring the Farm its first
| pennant, Captain Johnnie Hunken
i concluded his baseball career with
j three crashing hits and several good
' plays in the field.
In the infield, both Dykes Johnson
and Spud Hardy closed their colle
giate innings with Saturday's game,
j Max Cutshaw, utility infielder, also
j ended his ball-playing at Stanford
j and polished off the day with two
I hits.

Hector Dyer proved beyond
doubt that he is WykofT's mas- j
ler in the furlong. Even in this
event, lice's start was none too
good, according to bleacher
judges who were down in the
runway. Few will deny that
Dyer has the most powerful
finish of any athlete in this
country or elsewhere. And not a
few fans are wondering what i
Stanford's great relay team
could do to their own brand new
relay record if ai! of them were
fresh at the start.
