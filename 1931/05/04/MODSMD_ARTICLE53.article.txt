### 
In a polo game full of thrills ihe
Menlo Circus Club nosed out Stan
ford on the Menlo field Friday to ihe
tune of 9 to 7. Stanford started
strongly, and in the first chukker it

i swamped. A bad spill by Fleming,
however, wrecked the Indian hopes.

►injured, was so badly shaken up
that he was replaced by Clauson
I for the second half of the game. The
absence of their number one man
was so apparent that the Cardinals
\ went scoreless in the last four chuk
kers of the game.

| been accidentally knocked in by a
| Stanford man.
