# SEAVER VS. LITTLE MATCH ASSURED IN GOLF TITLE PLAY
## Bobby Jones Says He Will Be Unable To Play At Stanford Course 
### 
Farm golf fans were assured of a
"natural" in the semi-finals of the
University golf championship as
Lawson Little qualified to meet
Charlie Seaver with his 5 and 3
victory over Gene Brown, yesterday ,
on the Stanford links.
And at the same time they were
virtually assured that they would
not have the opportunity to see
Bobby Jones, the king of golfers, play
an exhibition on the Stanford course.'
Jones, who was in San Francisco
over this week-end to play a match
for charity, stated to a Daily re
porter Saturday that he would prob
ably not be able to play here. No
word of this decision has yet come
to Garry Bennett, varsity golf men
tor.
Little Favored
Little, being Northern California
amateur champion and second rank
ing player on the great frosh team,
upset no predictions by his defeat
of Brown, but he had a harder time
winning than his 5 and 3 margin in
dicates.
At the end of the first 18 holes
Saturday, he and Brown were all
square, as they had been at "the end
of the first nine. Shooting a par 3(>
for his next nine holes, Little worked
out a commanding four-hole lead
and then coasted home.
Stars Clash
When Little and Seaver, two of
the outstanding golf stars in school,
clash, there are sure to be fireworks.
With the possible exception of Mac-
Naughton, they are Stanford's best
and most-famous players.
According to Garry Bennett, both
the MacNaughton-Hellman and
Seaver-Little semifinal matches are
to be played off before Saturday in
order that the final match of the
tournament may take place on that
day or Sunday.
