GLADEWATER, Texas, May 3. (/P)
—East Texas' spectacular furnace of
death, the burning Sinclair No. 1
oil well four miles from here, did
not give an inch today, entertaining
spectators who came from many sec
tions to get as close as Texas Ran
gers would permit, with lengthening
flames and heavier rumblings.
