# HOOVER BRANDS ARMS COST AS BUSINESS DRAG
## President Sees Armaments Slash As Main Aid To Trade Recovery WAR BURDEN FLAYED Worldwide Commerce Body Hears Cut Plea 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 4. (/P) —
Scrapping of armaments was advo
cated by President Hpover today as
a major means by which the world
can encourage business revival. The
congress of the International Cham
ber of Commerce heard from him
that nearly $5,000,000,000 is spent
yearly for arms, 70 per cent more
than before the great war. This, he
called a burden upon economic re
cuperation, which gives rise to fear
and threats that contribute "to all
forms of instability, whether social,
political, or economic."
The President took his stand in
an address of welcome, which
opened a week of discussion by the
congress on ways to alleviate inter
national business dullness.
Claims War Liability
In the brief speech in Constitution
Hall, three blocks southwest of the
White House, he did not mention
the tariff or war debt questions. The
thousand delegates rose to applaud
his remarks at the conclusion. He
left immediately.
President Hoover attributed a
large share of responsibility for the
depression to the Great War, with
its resultant destruction of life and
property, increased taxes, and social
and political instability. This led to
his plea for co-operative limitation
and reduction of armament.
Seeks Co-operation
'"Endeavor as we must in support
of every proposal of international
economic co-operation that is just
to our respective peoples," he said,
"yet we must recognize that reduc
tion of this gigantic waste of compe
tition in military establishments is
in the ultimate of an importance
transcendent over all other forms
of economic effort."
He called attention to the forth
coming conference on reduction of
land arms, and said:
''Of all proposals for the economic
rehabilitation of the world, I know
of none which compares in necessity
or importance with the successful
result of that conference."
Wilbur Hears Plea
Two Cabinet members on the
speaker's platform were Secretaries
Wilbur and Hurley. The presiding
officer was Silas H. Strawn, presi
dent of the United States Chamber
of Commerce. Intx'oducing M. M.
Theunis, former Premier of Bel
gium, he voiced an expectation that
the ensuing deliberations would be
an enlightening help even though
no panacea for the depression is
found.

ber of Commerce heard from him
that nearly $5,000,000,000 is spent
yearly for arms, 70 per cent more
than before the great war. This, he
called a burden upon economic re
cuperation, which gives rise to fear
and threats that contribute "to all
forms of instability, whether social,
political, or economic."
The President took his stand in
an address of welcome, which
opened a week of discussion by the
congress on ways to alleviate inter
national business dullness.
Claims War Liability
In the brief speech in Constitution
Hall, three blocks southwest of the
White House, he did not mention
the tariff or war debt questions. The
thousand delegates rose to applaud
his remarks at the conclusion. He
left immediately.
President Hoover attributed a
large share of responsibility for the
depression to the Great War, with
its resultant destruction of life and
property, increased taxes, and social
and political instability. This led to
his plea for co-operative limitation
and reduction of armament.
Seeks Co-operation
'"Endeavor as we must in support
of every proposal of international
economic co-operation that is just
to our respective peoples," he said,
"yet we must recognize that reduc
tion of this gigantic waste of compe
tition in military establishments is
in the ultimate of an importance
transcendent over all other forms
of economic effort."
He called attention to the forth
coming conference on reduction of
land arms, and said:
''Of all proposals for the economic
rehabilitation of the world, I know
of none which compares in necessity
or importance with the successful
result of that conference."
Wilbur Hears Plea
Two Cabinet members on the
speaker's platform were Secretaries
Wilbur and Hurley. The presiding
officer was Silas H. Strawn, presi
dent of the United States Chamber
of Commerce. Intx'oducing M. M.
Theunis, former Premier of Bel
gium, he voiced an expectation that
the ensuing deliberations would be
an enlightening help even though
no panacea for the depression is
found.
