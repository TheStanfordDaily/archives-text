# Tragic Drowning Observed In New Gymnasium Pool
## 
### 
The first fatality in Stanford's new
women's swimming tank was re
ported last night by Fred Frehc,
campus officer. An inquest has not
yet been held, although deopsitions
have been taken, pending further
investigation.
Three men whose identity has not
yet been revealed, who are em
ployed by the University, are re
ported to have been in the vicinity
when the accident occurred. They
were cutting and burning grass near
the pool.
Efforts by the three to save the
unfortunate victim, struggling in
the water, were of no avail. Violent
thrashing about carried the semi
conscious body into deeper water.
Finally, the convulsive action ceased
and the lifeless body was brought to
shore. It was a gopher, terrified by
the burning grass, that scuttered to
the edge of the pool and fell to his
death.
