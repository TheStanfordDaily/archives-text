# Women Varsities May Bring Athletic Break
## 
### COLLYER CONNELL 
Necessity of a break with the !
; American Conference of Associated
College Women appears inevitable,
if Stanford women athletes are to
be allowed the fresh outlet of var
sity competition.
A tennis challenge to Mills Col
lege would entail severence with
the A.C.A.C.W., according to Ger
trude Hawley, acting director of
Roble gymnasium.
Benefits of belonging to (he con
ference are negligible, in the opin-
I ion of Gertrude Laidlaw, present
head of Stanford women's athletic
association, and this year's delegate
to the conference.,
"Large colleges make up the
greater part of the membership, and
| problems discussed do not apply to
Stanford's 500," declares Miss Laid
law.
Although agreeing that varsity
strife in tennis and golf seems a not
unreasonable climax to a proposed
season of class-to-class competition
betweeft bay institutions, Miss Haw
ley! on the other hand, doubts the
wisdom of a break with the
i A.C.A.C.W., which must precede

| such play.
The chief objection to varsity
competition among women, as Miss
Hawley sees it, and the A.C.A.C.W.
contends, lies in the resulting atti
tude of coach to players.
"The coaches will feel a respon
. sibility to produce winning teams,
and consequently devote a major
part of their time and attention to
the women who show greater pos
| sibilities on the athletic field," as
serts Miss Hawley.
i Dr. Bertha Stuart Dyment, medi
cal adviser for women, offers the
past history of women's varsities as
an objection to their renewal. In
former years, varsity play between
Stanford, California, and Mills worri
i on resulted in veritable hair-pulling
dissension, until even the coaches
and physical directors of the three
institutions were at each other's
throats. Whether the modern col-
I lege woman, grown up under the
i large-scale tradition of men's ath
letics, can carry on varsity defeat
• and triumph with creditable non
• chalance, is yet to be given trial,
! 1 says Dr. Dyment.
