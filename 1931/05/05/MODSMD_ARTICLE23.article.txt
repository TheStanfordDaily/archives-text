## 
### 
LONDON, May 4. (TP)â€”Philip j
1 Snowden, chancellor of the exche
quer, presented in the House of i
j Commons today the formal motion '
| proposing a penny on every five |
| pounds value of Great Britain's j
1 land. He thus fired the political shot <
' which, observers believe, will pre- |
i cipitate a new "war" between the I
lords and the commons and be- j
tween conservatives and laborites.
The Chancellor spoke with the fer
vor of an ancient crusader. "The i
land," he said, "was given by the
| Creator, not for the dukes but for i
I the equal use of all people."
Baldwin said he was "completely
I mystified as to what the whole busi
ness is about." "Such a discussion,"' i
Ihe added, "is entirely in the air." 1
