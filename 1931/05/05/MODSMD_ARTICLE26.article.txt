| at the final election of the organization in the house meetings last night.
Virginia Daugherty, who received the second highest number of votes,

j secretary of the group in the second election last week, which was called
to decide a tie between the second and third candidates. At that time it

Three Ballotings

. Pan-Hellenic officers went into ef
fect this year to replace the former
| method of annual progressive ro
| tation among the ten houses for the
I presidency.
Under the new system three can
i didates are nominated by a com
-1 mittee composed of the outgoing of
jficers of Pan-Hellenic and submit
j ted to the body for approval. After
| an unanimous consent by the mem
| bers of the organization, the nomi
i nees are voted upon by each of the
j sororities through their house meet
i ings. Each house has one vote.
Preferential Vote
The candidate receiving the high
: est number of votes is elected presi
! dent for the following year. Vice
: president and secretary go to the
j second and third nominees, respec-
I tively. In case of a tie, the tied
i candidates are referred back to the
| houses for revote.
In event of a tie in the final elec
; tion between the two highest candi-
J dates, the election is settled by the
j Pan-Hellenic group in meeting.
The new officers will take over [
their positions next Monday. Out
going officers are Jean Utt, president; 1
