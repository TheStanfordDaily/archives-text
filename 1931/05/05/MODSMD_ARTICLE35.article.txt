A new plan, requiring 15 signatures to eaeli nominating
petition, will be effective. It is designed to secure more
discrimination in the selection of nominees. This greater
discrimination is to be applied tliis time in the selection of
officers.

Whether the new signature requirement will actually
result in the exercise of greater discrimination is debata

election. The Daily has long maintained that a large part
of the careless attitude toward the selection of student of
fice-holders is due to the uselessness of most campus oil ices.
Indeed, there seems little necessity of making a careful
choice of those ollicers whose jobs mean nothing, whose
duties are few and non-essential. Since most student ol
licers are supernumeraries, why worry about discrimina
tion and careful selection?

Unfortunately, this careless allitude is adopted toward
the few student body offices which are exceedingly im
portant. Chief among these are: president, vice-president,
secretary of A.S.S.I .; members of the. Executive Commit
tee; members of Men's Council. Too often students have
been elected to membership in the Executive Committee
and Men's Council who have lacked the initiative and
ability necessary for constructive work in those two groups.
In-Ibis spring's election, four members of the Executive
Committee and three members of Men's Council are to be
elected. Now; is the lime to elect seven able and energetic
students to these vitally important positions. The election
will be held May 12, but the task begins tomorrow, when
the nominating period opens.
