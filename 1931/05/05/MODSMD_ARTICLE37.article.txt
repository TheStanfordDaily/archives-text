# BULL SESSION

There are certain things that are
intimately connected with the spring
quarter. First, there are the mosqui
tos big as blackbirds and fierce as
tigers. Then there is the problem
of Lagunita—for it is more than a
lake; it is always a vital problem to
know whether this quarter finds the
hollow behind Roble a inud Hat, or
a stagnant, insect-breeding pool.
The most consistently recurring
as well as the most spectacular of
spring problems, however, is the
burning of hay stacks.

Every yea'r workers,cut the hay,
stack it into little tempting piles;
and every year some people, to show
that traditions are not dying on the
farm, burn several of these accumu
lations of potential horse feed. This
quarter it is estimated that three
such burnings have taken place. To
rail against this destruction of pri
vate property is not our purpose.

There has been a custom, however,
to assess the cost of the destroyed
hay to the freshman treasury. En
cina, being the nearest living group
to the scene of the customary blaz
ing pyres, and the freshmen living
in Encina, the logic is clear that the
first-year men should pay the cost
of the damage. The fact that the
perpetrators of the deeds are not
known does not seem to decrease
the validity of the logic. This rea
soning is further strengthened by
the tacit and universal assumption
that freshmen are the most viciously
destructive of all classes.
Now the hay is not University
property; it is owned by some out

side corporation who has leased
hay-growing rights from the ad
ministration. If a commercial enter
prise desires to profit by growing
something on this campus, it seems
in conformity with truly economic
procedure that it should take the
risk of having their property burned.
If it succeeds in capturing the cul
prits, then it can handle those in
dividuals with proper severity. But
automatically to assess one campus
living group for the unknown burn
ings may be a tradition; but it sure
ly is a relic of ancient and rough
justice that has nothing in its favor
except that it is ancient.

It is extremely doubtful that the
freshmen set fire to these pyres. It
is quite possible, on the other hand,
that other groups—knowing that no
effort will be or could be made to
find the real "fire-bug"—will de
liberately set fire to the hay to
achieve the momentary aesthetic
pleasure of viewing the red tongues
silhouetted against the dark sky;
their sense of justice toward the
hay growers is set at ease because
these people will be compensated
out of the freshmen's treasury.

Firstly, there seems no reason why
living groups in general should pay
for crimes committed by no known
person in particular; secondly, if
payment must be made, the only
logical place is out of the student
body treasury—where it falls equal
ly on all members of the University
rather than upon one group—con
demned by precedent and taxed by
tradition. —Abe Mellinkoff.

automatically to assess one campus
living group for the unknown burn
ings may be a tradition; but it sure
ly is a relic of ancient and rough
justice that has nothing in its favor
except that it is ancient.

It is extremely doubtful that the
freshmen set fire to these pyres. It
is quite possible, on the other hand,
that other groups—knowing that no
effort will be or could be made to
find the real "fire-bug"—will de
liberately set fire to the hay to
achieve the momentary aesthetic
pleasure of viewing the red tongues
silhouetted against the dark sky;
their sense of justice toward the
hay growers is set at ease because
these people will be compensated
out of the freshmen's treasury.

Firstly, there seems no reason why
living groups in general should pay
for crimes committed by no known
person in particular; secondly, if
payment must be made, the only
logical place is out of the student
body treasury—where it falls equal
ly on all members of the University
rather than upon one group—con
demned by precedent and taxed by
tradition. —Abe Mellinkoff.
There are certain things that are
intimately connected with the spring
quarter. First, there are the mosqui
tos big as blackbirds and fierce as
tigers. Then there is the problem
of Lagunita—for it is more than a
lake; it is always a vital problem to
know whether this quarter finds the
hollow behind Roble a inud Hat, or
a stagnant, insect-breeding pool.
The most consistently recurring
as well as the most spectacular of
spring problems, however, is the
burning of hay stacks.

Every yea'r workers,cut the hay,
stack it into little tempting piles;
and every year some people, to show
that traditions are not dying on the
farm, burn several of these accumu
lations of potential horse feed. This
quarter it is estimated that three
such burnings have taken place. To
rail against this destruction of pri
vate property is not our purpose.

There has been a custom, however,
to assess the cost of the destroyed
hay to the freshman treasury. En
cina, being the nearest living group
to the scene of the customary blaz
ing pyres, and the freshmen living
in Encina, the logic is clear that the
first-year men should pay the cost
of the damage. The fact that the
perpetrators of the deeds are not
known does not seem to decrease
the validity of the logic. This rea
soning is further strengthened by
the tacit and universal assumption
that freshmen are the most viciously
destructive of all classes.
Now the hay is not University
property; it is owned by some out

side corporation who has leased
hay-growing rights from the ad
ministration. If a commercial enter
prise desires to profit by growing
something on this campus, it seems
in conformity with truly economic
procedure that it should take the
risk of having their property burned.
If it succeeds in capturing the cul
prits, then it can handle those in
dividuals with proper severity. But
automatically to assess one campus
living group for the unknown burn
ings may be a tradition; but it sure
