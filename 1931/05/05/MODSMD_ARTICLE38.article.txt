The Editor, Sir:
Is Stanford an institution for
grades or for love of learning? If
for the latter, the present grading
system is very unsatisfactory. It
creates a false goal for scholastic
efforts, teaching students to study
for the sake of grades rather than
for the sake of knowledge. For the
classrooms of Stanford have become
arenas for grade-contests instead of
laboratories for co-operative efforts
and interests. Is education to be
atrophied by the universal Ameri
can theory that "competition is the :
life of trade"?
The emphasis needs to be shifted.
Too much stress is laid on class av- j
erages and on A's, B'.s, and C's, and j
not enough on benefits derived. |
Thus grades seldom have any rela- j
tion to the students' mastery of the
subject, nor is the Bawlout the best
of I.Q. indices. Students depend on
the evaluation of their efforts given
by professors in the form of grades,
and not on self-made estimates of i
individual satisfaction in nccomp- j
lishment. As desire for grades de- j
creases, interest in learning in- j
creases.
Unusual products of our educa- !
tional machine are so in spite of the j
standardization they are subjected j
to. Education should become a stim- j
ulation rather than a memory-test!
to which all must conform or flunk. |
The student cannot be allowed to i
wander too far from the appointed j
currieular course to enjoy himself'

The Editor, Sir:
Is Stanford an institution for
grades or for love of learning? If
for the latter, the present grading
system is very unsatisfactory. It
creates a false goal for scholastic
efforts, teaching students to study
for the sake of grades rather than
for the sake of knowledge. For the
classrooms of Stanford have become
arenas for grade-contests instead of
laboratories for co-operative efforts
and interests. Is education to be
atrophied by the universal Ameri
can theory that "competition is the :
life of trade"?
The emphasis needs to be shifted.
Too much stress is laid on class av- j
erages and on A's, B'.s, and C's, and j
not enough on benefits derived. |
Thus grades seldom have any rela- j
tion to the students' mastery of the
subject, nor is the Bawlout the best
of I.Q. indices. Students depend on
the evaluation of their efforts given
by professors in the form of grades,
and not on self-made estimates of i
individual satisfaction in nccomp- j
lishment. As desire for grades de- j
