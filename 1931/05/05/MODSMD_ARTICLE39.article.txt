REACHING FOIi THE MOON-AI
the American Theatre, San Jose.
Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., is back
with us again with as much bounce
as ever and more amusement, as the
vital young financial wizard who
has never had anything to do with
women and proves it when he meets
Bebe Daniels, with a .blonde mop
instead of her usual "raven locks."
"Reaching for the Moon" is a
semi-musical comedy far above the
average of its type on the silver
screen. Music by Irving Berlin and
not too much of it—'nuff said.
Edward Everett Horton as Doug's
valet again proves himself the fun
niest man in Hollywood. His lines
as well as those of all the other
characters are excellent and never
slump into those slow moments
which characterize so many pic
tures. And certain of them, together
with one or two situations, would
not be out of place in the notorious
Green Street Theatre.
A first-rate "doughboy" comedy
with excursions into an Arabian
harem does not detract from the ex
cellence of the whole program.

ROMEO AND JULIET—At the
Columbia Theatre.
More satisfying was the Shakes
peare Guild's production of this
pathetic drama than llicir presenta
tion of Hamlet. The performance
moved swiftly and the characteriza
tions seemed far more distinct.
There were still a few objection
able creatures stalking the stage
and two comedy-caricatures- of the
Nurse and Peter—were disconcert
ing. But Myron Beggs' Mercutio and
the lovers, William Thornton and
Huth Neely, improved the situation.
The production was conventional
in all but two incidents: the final
scene was made into two and the
lovers' parting in the fourth act

opened on a tableau more gratifying
than the others we have seen.
Criticism of Thornton seems to be
that lie takes less important lines too
seriously, delivers them sonorously.
. As a Romeo he isn't joyous enough.
I A little less restraint would be more
believable. —J. S. S.
