# CABBAGES and Things..

Poetry, lyrical, nonsensical, hys
terical, pitiful, and everything else.
But nothing's quite as artistic as a
good old limerick verse, in our vege
table estimation.
Dunno anything about the lucky
egg who won our magnificent dope
contest on the track score for last
Saturday. Maybe he didn't want the
shoes he won, or maybe he wears
sun-tan sandals and can't possibly
use all-enveloping leather. But
mebbe he has a pal? And the fact
remains that we promised the top
man an unforgettable something to
be printed in the colyum.
A guy named Walt Desmond,
one day,
In a dope contest entered, to say
Who would win in the meet;
Now he's clothes for his feet;
Bui the victory went the wrong
way.
Isn't that a lovely thing, though?
(Editor's note.)
A couple of dozen of our strong
minded women had free lunches
yesterday, all for a worthy cause.
What in the world is more touching
than a Stanford woman pleading for
donations for unfortunate kiddies,
or for a package of cigarettes? Why,
two of the same breed washing win
dows out at the Home, on Labor
Day. See you all there?
Our very own symphony orches
tra is musicking for us tonight, in
the Assembly Hall. No one ever pays
any attention to things like that
around here, and those students
who work away at it themselves,
unaided, are certainly to be admired.
Now, if only the result is real music,
we'll call it a fine thing. What hope,
orchestra?
A word in passing winch may
serve as an ad for non-skid
tires or high walls beside dark
highways, or something. Pity the
poor men in a black Beta Au
burn, the other night, who found
themselves hanging between the
road by the golf course and blue
Infinity, without enough energy
to decide which they were
readier for. College days ....
