## RECOGNITIONS 
### 
By knocking over S.F.U. on
Saturday, Harry Wolter and his
Stanford nine completed one of
the most successful seasons in
the history of baseball on the
Farm. Congratulations should be
extended to both Coach Harry
Wolter and to Captain Ilunkcn,
not so much for the victories
themselves hut lor the way in
which those victories were ac
complished in the face of many
and diverse difficulties.
For six long years Harry Wolter !
has worked to develop a winning !
ball club only to have his hopes ;
dashed to pieces by mediocre pitch- !
ing. The ability to "lake them on i
Ihe chin" and come up again the j
next year with even more lire is one J
vary marked characteristic of the
Indians' coach.
At the opening of the league
season every infield position in
cluding the catcher was tilled by
a new man. Dykes Johnson, who
had played two seasons at short, i
was moved over to third; Spud
Hardy, varsity catcher for two
seasons, took over the first sack;
and both Delmas at Short, and
Philippi at second, were playing
their first season for the Card
varsity. Despite this seemingly
heavy handicap, Wolter devel
oped the outstanding infield in !
the conference.

Never having missed a single in- j
ning of a single game in the four i
years of baseball competition at
Stanford (freshman year and three |
varsity years), Captain Hunken j
guided his team to three straight ;
wins over California, and Stanford's â€¢
first pennant, by the sheer enthusi- !
asm of his own spirit.

No mention of the season of
lfl.'il could possibly he made
without giving Dan Johnson his |
due share of credit. Winning
nine league games and losing but
one, Johnson proved to be the
answer of Stanford fans for a
dependable pitcher. The more
men on bases, the greater im- i
portance of the game, acted only
as stimulants for Johnson to
pilch his best. The 4-5) taming
of the Trojans undoubtedly
marked the high-spot of John- j
son's pitching as he held the l
slugging sons of Troy to three
hits and no runs.
Although every member of the
Cards' infield deserves a word of |
praise, Dykes Johnson and Spud 1
Hardy are selected for special men- j
lion because of the tremendous im- !
provemenl shown in their all-around !
play. Hardy developed into one of!
Ihc league's most reliable first-sack- I
or:;, while Dykes Johnson has our j
unqualified nomination for the best j
I bird-baseman in the conference.
Outside of the glare of pub
licity attached to the conference
championship are several men
who worked hard, and practiced
every day as though they were
members of the first string.
Yard Loomis, by his many in
nings of pitching and by the four
victories credited to him, made
a Stanford victory possible. In
(lie line-up until Rintala came
out. Dixon contributed a great
many hits in those first league
names which have now been
forgotten. Coaching third in
every game in which he didn't
play, Phil Dixon added only en
couragement to the Cards' hopes.
First out to practice for two years
nd last to leave almost every day,
lal Ricde finally achieved his ambi
ion to pitch a game for Harry Wol- j
