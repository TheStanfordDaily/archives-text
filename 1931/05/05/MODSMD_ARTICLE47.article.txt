# Indian Runners Prepare for Revenge at Fresno
## INDIGNATION OVER S.C. DECISION MAY OCCASION PROTEST Stanford To Decide Today On Acceptance Of Judge's Ruling 
### Fritz Goodwin 
! Still smarting under the unex
! peeled defeat Saturday at the hands
Jof Dean Cromwell's Trojan track
men, the Indian squad went through
individual workouts in the Stadium
yesterday by way of preparation for
| the relay meet at Fresno this Sat
i urday. When Templeton's men don
the spiked shoes at the valley city's
track there will be one objective
j uppermost—to take revenge on the
i Red and Gold runners.
Indian athletic circles are gener
ally indignant over the judging in
' the much-discusded quarter-mile
race, in which Vic Williams, S.C.
1 star,' fought his way out of a perfect
! Cardinal box on the stretch to break
j the tape for five points. A gentle
i man from Southern California who
was serving as judge at the final
j turn was in favor of disqualifying
1 Les Hables of Stanford, who was
j running directly in front of Wil
. liams as the runners came into the
| stretch.
Judge's Opinion Overruled
This judge's opinion was overruled
j by the other officials of the race,
j who expressed personal opinions,
that Williams was the runner to be
| disqualified. This action could not
i be taken, however, in view of the
report of the judge at the point
j where the foul occurred.
| Since Spicer, the |udge involved,
j is not an A.A.U. official, there is a
j strong possibility that Stanford may
! protest the 440 event, or even others
' which he judged. William B. Owens,
I faculty representative on the Pa
| cific Coast Intercollegiate Confer
; ence, stated yesterday that Stari
; ford's action on the matter is not
' yet decided, but that a decision will
; be reached by Farm officials today.
Captain Podge Smith was out for
practice yesterday, although he con
lined his efforts to a few paces on
j the grass. Smith's leg muscles
cramped in the 220-yard low hur
dle race Saturday, and he was forced
to drop out after the third barrier.
, tor when he went in in the last
U.C.L.A. tilt with the bases loaded
and the score threatening to be tied
i and conference hopes disappearing
over the horizon. Baseball fans won't
forget Rieae's performance for some
j time to come.
Next to Johnson's pitching, the
Indians' success is due to the over
i powering force of the hitting seen
j all along the batting order. However
Rintala and Delmas stand out as the
; most consistent and dangerous bat
-1 tcis in the Cards' lineup. At the
j beginning of the season Vince Phil
ippi won several games by his time
:ly hitting and although he had a
I .slump in the Southern trip Philippi
! finished up the season with an aver
age of .347.

Not only have well-wishers of
baseball on the Farm hoped for
championship teams, but also
would dream of a first-class ball
field. This season saw the inau
guration of a beautiful new dia
mond and rightfully enough the
team took the occasion to dedi
cate their field by grabbing the
first pennant seen in these parts.

! Still smarting under the unex

Jof Dean Cromwell's Trojan track
men, the Indian squad went through
individual workouts in the Stadium
yesterday by way of preparation for
| the relay meet at Fresno this Sat
i urday. When Templeton's men don
the spiked shoes at the valley city's
track there will be one objective
j uppermost—to take revenge on the
i Red and Gold runners.
Indian athletic circles are gener
ally indignant over the judging in
' the much-discusded quarter-mile
race, in which Vic Williams, S.C.
1 star,' fought his way out of a perfect
! Cardinal box on the stretch to break
j the tape for five points. A gentle
i man from Southern California who
was serving as judge at the final
j turn was in favor of disqualifying
1 Les Hables of Stanford, who was
j running directly in front of Wil
. liams as the runners came into the
| stretch.
Judge's Opinion Overruled
This judge's opinion was overruled
j by the other officials of the race,
j who expressed personal opinions,
that Williams was the runner to be
| disqualified. This action could not
i be taken, however, in view of the
report of the judge at the point
j where the foul occurred.
| Since Spicer, the |udge involved,
j is not an A.A.U. official, there is a
j strong possibility that Stanford may
! protest the 440 event, or even others
' which he judged. William B. Owens,
I faculty representative on the Pa
| cific Coast Intercollegiate Confer
; ence, stated yesterday that Stari
; ford's action on the matter is not
' yet decided, but that a decision will
; be reached by Farm officials today.
Captain Podge Smith was out for
practice yesterday, although he con
lined his efforts to a few paces on
j the grass. Smith's leg muscles
cramped in the 220-yard low hur
dle race Saturday, and he was forced
to drop out after the third barrier.
, tor when he went in in the last
U.C.L.A. tilt with the bases loaded
and the score threatening to be tied
i and conference hopes disappearing
over the horizon. Baseball fans won't
forget Rieae's performance for some
j time to come.
Next to Johnson's pitching, the
Indians' success is due to the over
i powering force of the hitting seen
j all along the batting order. However
Rintala and Delmas stand out as the
; most consistent and dangerous bat
-1 tcis in the Cards' lineup. At the
j beginning of the season Vince Phil
ippi won several games by his time
:ly hitting and although he had a
I .slump in the Southern trip Philippi
! finished up the season with an aver
age of .347.

Not only have well-wishers of
baseball on the Farm hoped for
championship teams, but also
would dream of a first-class ball
field. This season saw the inau
guration of a beautiful new dia
mond and rightfully enough the
team took the occasion to dedi
cate their field by grabbing the
first pennant seen in these parts.
