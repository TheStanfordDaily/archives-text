E. E. Roberts (center), mayor of Reno, Nevada, for the past eight years, is opposed by two candidates
in his effort to be re-elected today. Milburn R. Gregory (left), real estate dealer and World War veteran,
and Howard Doyle (right), business man, are his opponents. Wide-open gambling, legalized recently in
Nevada, figured in the pre-election campaign.
