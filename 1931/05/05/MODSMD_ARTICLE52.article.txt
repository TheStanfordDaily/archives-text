# BABE SOCCERMEN FALL UNDER FAST PLAY OF SENIORS
## Eberhart Scores Feature Goal Of Day; Wright Nets Two Points 
### 
The senior class soccermen ended
their soccer careers in a blaze of
glory yesterday when they , took the
fast freshman team into camp to the
tune of 3-0, in the final game of the
interclass soccer series for the cham
pionship of the University.
The first ten minutes of play
brought forth a fine exhibition of
soccer from both teams, with the
odds slightly in favor of the fresh
men, but the senior goalie managed
to prevent a score. After this pre
liminary attack the freshmen weak
ened slightly and the seniors gave
Peache, the frosh goalie, plenty to
think about. He put up an excellent
battle, but his short stature counted
against him in the end.
Wright, playing inside right for
the seniors, accounted for two of
the goals, but the most beautiful
sliot of the game is credited to Eber
hart, who netted a fine kick in the
closing minutes of play.
