### 
NEW YORK, May 5. (A 3 )â€” Smiling
but tight-lipped on all questions of
diplomacy, politics, and economics,
Senator Dwight W. Morrow of New
Jersey arrived today on the liner
Majestic from a two months' vaca
tion in Europe.
The Senatoi - , who was accom
panied by Mrs. Morrow and Miss
Amy Aldrich, friend of the Morrow
family, looked in much better health
than when he sailed.
He motored direct to his home in
Englewood, N.J., but planned later
in the day to attend the funeral of
George F. Baker, financier.
Reporters deluged him *vith ques
tions concerning the Franco-Italia
naval situation and other disarma
ment matters, but he smilingly de
clined to talk.
He only laughed when asked
about published reports of a vice
presidential boom for him.
