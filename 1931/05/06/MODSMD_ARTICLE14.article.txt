# Haystack Roughs Recall Bumptious Predecessors
## 
### Collier Connell 
The modern rough who considers
himself a back-to-nature enthusiast
by moving his bed into a haystack
will be discouraged to learn that his
predecessors have far out-distanced
I him.
It all happened back in the days
1 before Sequoia took up ping pong,
j back during the first years of the
j new century, that disciples of Tho
reau gave the Quad the early savor
j of a movie colony. Their names, lost
I in the shuffle of ancient bawlouts,
i are yet remembered by old class-
I mates as "Barefoot Bill" and the
"Blanket Man."
"Barefoot Bill," registered in '01
and 02, was an ardent believer in
the natural life. Shoeless, as was
his custom, he padded about the
paved runways of the Quad in
pinkly fresh, but calloused feet, un
til the Administration forccd on him
the pediatric bonds of the era.
Simplified spelling found in him
a staunch crusader. Bluebooks writ
ten in terse orthography proved the
bane of Bill's professors. One of his
morning habits was to make the
i rounds of the classrooms, spreading

: each blackboard with propaganda,
such as "$2,000,000 wurth uv ink iz
wasted ech yeer in the printing uv
useless leters."
Forced to leave the University, not
j from failing eyesight, but rather
j from sore feet, he proceeded south
' ward, organized a cult of Utopians
jto go to th eSamoan Islands, and
j from there the world has heard
| sounds of him in the issuance of so
! cialist textbooks.
j His successor on the campus ap-
I peared in '03 and '04 in the "Blanket
I Man," philosopher-tramp who at
tended classes for several quarters,
i though boasting no line in the bawl
out.
i Versatile, picturesque, dressed
' only in a flowing blanket, girt about
' with a belt, and sandals, this local
! Gandhi became a social catch
I among the fraternity brethren along
| the Row. No rushing dinner prom
â–  ised a success without him; jazz and
1 Beethoven, philosophy and world
| gossip held his audience, but not
j until he knocked out two fraternity
j men in friendly boxing matches was
his reputation cinched.
