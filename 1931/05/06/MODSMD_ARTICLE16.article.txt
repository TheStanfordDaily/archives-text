# PRACTICAL JOKERS MAY GET CHARGES OF ARSON, WARNING
## 
### 
Another $80 in student body treas
ury stock was wafted away in grass
fire smoke last night when pseudo
humorous roughs ignited four piles
of the University's hay in various
parts of the campus. Three of the
fires were near Encina, and were
celebrated by a crowd of freshmen
who seemed determined to get some
thing for thir money. The other
blaze was near Sequoia.
Robert E. Dugan, campus fire
chief, correcting a statement in yes
terday's Daily, said last night that
no one class or dormitory will be
made to pay for the burning of the
stacks, but that the student body as
a whole will be charged.
"Any person caught starting one
of these fires will be prosecuted for
arson," Chief Dugan declared, "and
the mere fact that one is a Univer
sity student will not have him from
a penitentiary sentence."
The four fires last night bring the
total up to nine for the last two
weeks.
