# CONCERT SCORES HIT LAST NIGHT
## Charles Bubb, Trumpeter, Program Highlight 
### Helen Thomas 
With a delicacy of feeling and pre
cision that would have done credit
to a professional group, Daniel Bry
ant and his student symphony or
chestra presented their spring quar
ter concert before a large and ap
preciative audience in the Assembly
Hall last night.
The program was judiciously
chosen and executed with skill. The
student musicians co-operate well,
without sacrificing the individuality
of each section of the orchestra. At
no time was a theme muffled, and all
major moods were well emphasized.
Perhaps the only fault was a ten
dency to overprecision at the expense
of spontaneity.
"Surprise Symphony" Pleases
Haydn's "Surprise Symphony," so
familiar to music lovers, was the
main offering in the first group. The
symphony has a grace and freedom
that flow smoothly through all four
movements, with the sole desire of
giving pleasure. It is simple and
jubilant, even in the Andante move
ment.
Charles Bubb, the freshman trum
peter, was the highlight of the eve
ning. The rapid crescendos of Hart
mann's Polka rippled under his fin
gers with precision, spirit, and deli
cacy of tone. His notes were full,
rich, and accurate.
Encore Demanded
In direct contrast to the lively
Poika came his encore, Schubert's
"Ave Maria," giving the soloist an
opportunity to display the lyric ca
pacity of his instrument.
Closing the program, Strauss'
Tales from Vienna Woods" was
presented. The melody is as Aus
trian in time and harmony as the
Danube Waltz," which it immedi
ately calls to mind. Bryant man
aged to introduce an originality of
presentation without sacrificing the
strongly marked swing of the mel
ody. The whole was a tone picture
admirably painted.
