## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 5. (/P) â€”
Frank J. Hogan today received a
telegram from Albert B. Fall, in
forming him that the former Interior j
Secretary did not wish to appeal his
conviction on a charge of taking a
bribe from E. L. Doheny, oil man, to
the Supreme Court.
Hogan, attorney for Fall, returned
to Washington last night from a trip j
abroad. He wrote Fall from Europe
asking him if he wished to ask the
Supreme Court to review his trial
which ended in a sentence of a year
in jail and a fine of $100,000. Fall
announced Sunday from his home
at Three Fivers, Now Mexico, that
he would not appeal. Today, he i
briefly directed Hogan not to carry i
the case further.
The District of Columbia Court of '
Appeals on April 6 affirmed the
sentence given Fall in the District '
of Columbia Supreme Court. The '
mandate of the court would have
been handed down in 15 days. Ho
gan, however, through members of
his law firm, obtained a stay of 30
days for his client.
