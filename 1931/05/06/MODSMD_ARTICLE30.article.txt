# SO THEY SAY.....
## POLITICS AND THE PROFESSOR 
### 
(The Daily Princetonian)
An opinion widely current among [
so-called "men of affairs" is that the j
college professor is either an im
practical theorist or a visionary
aesthete. To them the idea of a pro
fessor taking an active part in public
affairs is either ridiculous or terri
fying, depending on the circum
stances. A far different conclusion,
however, is implied in two current
magazine articles: '"Woodiow Wil
son: a Reappraisal," by Claude G. j
Bowers, in Current History, and "Is j
There Hope for Politics," by Profes
sor John Dewey, in Scribner's.
The former is an appreciation of J
special interest to Princeton men,
since it attributes Wilson's great
ness as a statesman largely to the
long years of study and reflection
he spent within Princeton's walls,
mastering the fundamentals of po
litical science and forming after
much critical thought the compre
hensive national and international
program he afterwards put into
practice. The latter is a penetrating
analysis of the evils of contemporary
American politics, among which
Professor Dewey stresses the public
apathy, cynicism, and contempt for
politics which are caused by the
incompetence and malpractices of i
the two great parties. As a remedy J
for these evils, Professor Dewey j
proposes the creation of a new po- i
litical party, outlines a program of
liberal principles, and adds the sig- 1
nificant statement: "There is no
education when ideas and knowledge
are not translated into emotion, in
terest, and volition."
Both of these articles serve to dis
prove the man of affairs' conception
of the college professor, the one in
its subject, the other in its author.
It can hardly be denied that much
of the intelligent political and eco
nomic thinking of today goes on in
the ivory tower of the university.
Many a man of political ability who
j finds his deepest interest in national
i and international affairs is forced
J into the academic life, by his con-
I tempt for the present state of poli-
I tics in this country. There he finds
| means for the constructive reflec-
I tion and comprehensive view upon
i which Mr. Bowers predicates Wil-
J son's statesmanship, and the lack of
| which he notes in the petty political
j life of the day.
Such a reformation of American
i politics as Professor Dewey is striv
ing actively to bring about would
doubtless open the field to many of
these potential statesmen and leave
their consciences untrammeled. But
they should take note, in the rnean
| time, of the example of such men
jas Woodrow Wilson and John
Dewey, who have not hesitated to
I plunge "in medias res" and to do
j their share in bringing better days,
j The education of the rising genera-
I tion will of course go far toward
! preparing the way, but the? active
j participation of intelligent political
â–  thinkers with a cultural background
would go still further.
