Today's the day. What with un
employment being the established
American custom, maybe wo should
be singing the hallelujah chorus be
cause we have something to do.
When the country finally de
cities that it has enough bond
salesmen running loose, a lot of
sons of the Stanford Red may
be chopping rails for a living.
Today's the day to get in trim.
Even if there weren't a charitable
cause for all the extra energy spent,
heaven sends only one or two times
in a collegiate lifetime when evei
the least of us can buy peanuts and
soda pop from Greta and Taffy and
Winx and Dynamite and the rest . . .
\
And then there arc the dozen
unsuspecting sheep (strictly lo
cal) who arc to be sacrificed to
the great God Appetite. There's
something appealing about
thirty-five hundred grimy col
legians, at the end of Labor Day,
standing in line with a tin cup
in each hand, waiting for chow.
Another thing, ladeez and others,
is that the Honorable Old Boy will
make his last public appearance, ex
cept in print and a few other places,
before he doffs his whiskers and
enters his period of second child
hood. This ought to be good. Stand
around!
Wouldn't it be funny if we'd won
the track meet after all, on a tech
nicality, because some one of the
powers that be had a pet gripe
against us? Wait and see. They talk
us out of $5)9 every three months.
What's a mere track decision?
