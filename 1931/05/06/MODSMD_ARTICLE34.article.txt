Psychologists are often bringing |
forth mysterious and highly scien- |
tific means ol' measuring the intelli- j
gence of the people. Various guard- j
ians of the race have at one time
or the other also suggested some
criterions upon which we can judge
the mental endowments of Ihe pub
lic. One norm that has been over
looked—probably because it is so
obvious—is the character of our ad
vertisements. The type of ad that
appeals to the citizenry is a sure in
dication of the quality of their in
tellect.
The abundant use of testimonials
of no actual foundation or true sig
nificance, and the fact that people
swallow these paid endorsements is
positively a slur on American in
telligence. If Mrs. Helene K. Dil
lingwater of the Boston Dilling
waters claims that she sleeps sound
ly on Simmons beds (adv.), is that
any reason why Jane Doe should
find comfort on Simmons beds
(adv.)? Particularly has the en
dorsal no meaning when one real
izes that in all probability Mrs.
Dillingwater endorsed the beds to
get her name and picture plastered
over half a nation.
Because Mrs. Astorfilts (who by
the way holds down the No. 1 berth
on the flashy four-hundred) claims
that she rests well at her $500,000
Long Island mansion on top of San
o-lufs (adv.) mattresses is no cause
for my sleeping soundly on them,
j Mrs. Astorfilts may be eo coti
| structed, may have so much avoir
! dupois, that a board would feel
, comfortable for her, while on the
; other hand I may be so thin that
i soap bubbles would bruise my pro
truding bones.
Because Mr. Alexander Z. Brand
! wood 111 of the Lakeside Club polo
four, and member of the ancient

and accepted family of New York
Brandwoods smokes a certain cigar
is no reason for my copying him.
The fact that America will wash
with whatever soap—or drink, dress,
smoke, and sleep whatever is en
dorsed is a sad commentary on in
tellectual progress.
The second characteristic of mod
ern advertising that speaks poorly
for the national intelligence is the
prevalent and sickening use of al- j
luring beauties to sell everything
from chewing tobacco to tractors.
Why the individual should smoke a
certain brand of tobacco because
some coy young thing, with the
breeze playing with her skirts ai
her well-shaped knees, asks the man
|in the picture to blow some her
! way, is beyond normal comprehen
! sion. Because the sun will sun-burn
j some beauty well-exposed by the
! aid of a scantily cut bathing suit, is
| no reason for smoking cigarettes. A
! perfectly charming creature draped
! over a full page of a magazine
J should be no incentive for my bay
! ing automobiles with "Bodies by
Fisher" (adv.).
The fact remains, however, that
if an individual were to abstain from
purchasing commodities whose ad
vertisement depended on the vise of
ill-founded testimonials, or upon
the wanton prevalence of female
I figures, he would never be able to
i dress in the morning, or even go to
j sleep in a bed the night before, or
! walk on rugs, or get into an auto
mobile, or put gas in the car—in
| short, he would be forced to sit
draped in fig leaves out in the mid
dle of the desert and slowly starve
to death. Even then some advertis
ing agent would probably rush over
\ a sand dune and plead for a testi
monial for Sun-tan (adv.) —a sure
cure for sunburn.
