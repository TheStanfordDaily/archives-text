"AN AMERICAN PAPEIi"—GEE: |
The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations 1o Mr. Abe Mel- ;
linkoff, Beverly Hills, Calif.
An American has brushed aside j
the sham of internationalism. Mr. {
MellinkofT asks that we stay out of !
the League of Nations. Of course the
able debater will also advocate
staying out of the League Court, for |
joining that body is tantamount to
joining the League of Nations. Mr. !
MellinkofTs action is commendable. 1
The Daily now, truly becomes 1
"An American Paper for the Ameri- ;
can People."
International bankers, interna-*
tional busy-bodies, and out-and-out j
Internationalists have, unfortunate- i
ly, done a thorough job in propa
gandizing American universities !
with League Court and League of i
Nations "ballyhoo."
It, takes courage for Mr. MellinkofT j
1o go against that tide in even a j
moderate manner.
When we are asked to join the
League Court in order to decide on '
the legality of a Greek street car
franchise in Jerusalem. (The notori- ,
ous League Court Mavromrnatis de- j
cisions.)
When we are asked to defend the
far-flung British Empire with
American fighting men. (As pro
vided in the League "territorial in
tegrity clause.")
When we are asked to abandon
the Star-Spangled Banner for the
Internationale, and a proud national
heritage for a hypocritical interna
tional viewpoint, it is a pleasure to
see some writers lash out against
college casuistry engendered by
methodical falsehoods.
Mr. MellinkofT can feel proud that
he is "reactionary" and "provincial." j
If there are enough people like him
the United States will never send
70,000 men to be butchered, "to
make the world safe for democracy,"
again.
