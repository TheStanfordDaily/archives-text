"More Copy" is the seventh an
nual volume of unpublished short j
stories and sketches of students in j
the courses of writing at Columbia j
University; worth reading, too, if !
only to watch the trend of story j
writers who write just for the love |
of it, away from sex to the finer j
1 points of psychology.
Stories and sketches of death, dis- |
appointments, disease, old age, and
other hitherto-considered unpleas
antness predominates in this slim
volume. Whether it is because wom
en take more to this pastime of
creative writing or because the men
work, the literary females have
more contributions than the literary
i males. The ratio is something like
live to one.
The women writers show a great
deal of that thing called talent,
which in their case means at times
a masterly way of analyzing people
and situations, minutely. Distinctly
modern is their viewpoint, and in
stead of touching on any one of the
thousand versions of the "eternal
triangle" they write about people
like Lau Ni, who is the old woman
in "The Old Woman Who Suffers."
Or they take the Misses Helen Ford
and Laura Taylor in the process of
experiencing the delights of a hot
chocolate, or the sad fate of the
"Toy Canary" little Enid couldn't
j resist buying, though she should

have known belter. —W.R.
LA GIOCANDA—At the Tivoli
Theatre, San Francisco.
Opera, we have heard, in fading
to keep up with the times, is com
mitting slow suicide. The Pacific-
Opera Company demonstrated the
truth of this assertion in part, at
least. For while the music was pleas
ant, the voices adequate or better,
other considerations forced them
selves in rudely.
Scenically, the productions re
sembled early offerings of a not
too-budding Quad sketcher. The
costumes rivaled a masque ball for
brilliancy and bad taste, the trailing
velvets worn by the leading ladies
producing a ludicrous effect as they
dragged themselves out long after
the aforementioned females had dis
appeared from view.
The acting was as bad as only
acting of opera or hammed Shake
speare can be. And when it had a
faint chance of impressing, the dis
interested nose-scratchings of chorus
men arid unsequestered converse of
chorus ladies seduced the onlooker's
glance.
Music, without something ap
proaching technical modernity, does
not entertain us to that point where
we shout ecstatic bravos. While car
pet sweepers and unperspected scen
ery surround an opera we'll take
ours from the air, toothpaste ads
or no. —J.S.S.

LA GIOCANDA—At the Tivoli
Theatre, San Francisco.
Opera, we have heard, in fading
to keep up with the times, is com
mitting slow suicide. The Pacific-
Opera Company demonstrated the
truth of this assertion in part, at
least. For while the music was pleas
ant, the voices adequate or better,
other considerations forced them
selves in rudely.
Scenically, the productions re
sembled early offerings of a not
too-budding Quad sketcher. The
costumes rivaled a masque ball for
brilliancy and bad taste, the trailing
velvets worn by the leading ladies
producing a ludicrous effect as they
dragged themselves out long after
the aforementioned females had dis
appeared from view.
The acting was as bad as only
acting of opera or hammed Shake
speare can be. And when it had a
faint chance of impressing, the dis
interested nose-scratchings of chorus
men arid unsequestered converse of
chorus ladies seduced the onlooker's
glance.
Music, without something ap
proaching technical modernity, does
not entertain us to that point where
we shout ecstatic bravos. While car
pet sweepers and unperspected scen
ery surround an opera we'll take
ours from the air, toothpaste ads
or no. —J.S.S.

"More Copy" is the seventh an
nual volume of unpublished short j
stories and sketches of students in j
the courses of writing at Columbia j
University; worth reading, too, if !
only to watch the trend of story j
writers who write just for the love |
of it, away from sex to the finer j
1 points of psychology.
Stories and sketches of death, dis- |
appointments, disease, old age, and
other hitherto-considered unpleas
antness predominates in this slim
volume. Whether it is because wom
en take more to this pastime of
creative writing or because the men
work, the literary females have
more contributions than the literary
i males. The ratio is something like
live to one.
The women writers show a great
deal of that thing called talent,
which in their case means at times
a masterly way of analyzing people
and situations, minutely. Distinctly
modern is their viewpoint, and in
stead of touching on any one of the
thousand versions of the "eternal
triangle" they write about people
like Lau Ni, who is the old woman
in "The Old Woman Who Suffers."
Or they take the Misses Helen Ford
and Laura Taylor in the process of
experiencing the delights of a hot
chocolate, or the sad fate of the
"Toy Canary" little Enid couldn't
j resist buying, though she should

have known belter. —W.R.
