# GLRBB CONTEST HELD Anyway, It's A Good Story EVEN EXFORD STUMPED
## 
### 
Examinations have of late been
! accused of giving rise to a competi
: tive sport known as a "grade-con
test." The word "quiz," a synonym
j for "ex," started as a game.
It happened at old Exford, many
: years ago. A group of students had
; gathered together and for diversion
j an experimentation with queer let
! ter combinations was suggested.
; QXZ was suggested. Since that was
i unpronouncable, a 'U" was later sub
| stituted.
! In order to make a really good
j word out of the combination, an "I"
j was added and QUIZ was the result.
The experimentation had been car
ried on on one of the interior walls
of the university.
The appearance of this work on
j the campus caused much consterna
| tion among other students. Its origin
I was a mystery to most; it seemed as
j unsolvable as questions in examina
j tions. The connection between the
| two was readily seen, and the words
| became synonymous. The idea
spread, and so "quiz" is used in uni-
I vensities all over the world at pres
ent. At any rate, that's the story.
