# NEW YORK MAYOR TALKS SHOP WITH LIVERPOOL LEADER
## British And American Civic Dignitaries Exchange Confidences 
### 
NEW YORK, May 5. (/P)â€”Two
men who know a lot about it got
together today and talked over this
business of being mayor.
"The mayor of New York is only
three-sixteenths of the government,"
said Mayor James J. Walker to Loid
Mayor Edwin Thompson of Liver
pool.
"There are times, however, when
he is more than that. When visitors
are received he is the whole show
and when political investigators
come to town the people are made
to believe the mayor is the whole
thing."
Briton Confides
"In our country," the Liverpool
dignitary confided, "the Lord Mayor
is not given a vulgar fraction. He is
merely a figurehead, ungainly, and
performs no useful purpose what
ever."
The Lord Mayor, paying his eighth
visit to the United States, arrived
for the formal welcome at City Hall
wearing black robes, trimmed with
gold, and a peruke. The Liverpool
town clerk, clad in knee breeches,
cutaway coat, and gold-trimmed hat,
walked in the van carrying the Lord
Mayor's sceptre. A band played and
5,000 people cheered.
Presents Gifts
The Lord Mayor told Mr. Walker
that business in England seemed to
be improving and both expressed
hope that the friendly ties that bind
the two great maritime cities would
never be sundered.
After that the English dignitary
presented the city two pieces of
china that had adorned the city hall
at Liverpool since 1892.
Mayor Walker thanked him for
the gift, pointing out that many dis
tinguished visitors "bring us their
kind regards."
