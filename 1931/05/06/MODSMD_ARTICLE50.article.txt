# COULD FLAYS NEVADA EXECUTIVE GROUP Committee Drops "Desert Wolf," Humor Publication CHAPPIE EDITOR IRED AT "INTERFERENCE"
## 
### 
That "it's none of their business"
is the opinion of Burnell Gould, ed
itor of the Stanford Chaparral, con
cerning the recent recommendation
of the student executive committee
of the University of Nevada to dis
continue publication of the Nevada
Desert Wolf, student humor maga
zine.
In commenting yesterday upon the
controversy now being waged on the
Nevada campus, Gould claimed that
if a comic publication is not good
enough, it will die of its own ac
cord.
"Student executive committees at
the present time are interfering en
tirely too much in affairs that are
out of their province. Interference
of any executive committee in any
comics publication is usually found
to be ridiculous and unwarranted,"

' he said.
Recommendation to discontinue
1 publication of the magazine is based
upon the contention that the Desert
Wolf requires support from the
funds of the student body, which
funds might be used to further de
baling and drama. Coaches of
J those two activities, however, are
not willing to use the funds at the
expense of discontinuing the Desert
Wolf. Reno merchants, as well as
the majority of the student body,
i appear to be in favor of continuing
the magazine.
"The whole thing is typical of ex
ecutive committee action," stated
Gould. "I regret to see the passing
of any humor publication, especially
at Nevada, where humor seems to
be so much a part of the political
j scene."
