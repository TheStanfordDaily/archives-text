## 
### 
MEXICO CITY, May 5 (/P).—The
United States tucked away the final
two matches of its Davis Cup series
with Mexico today to make the
count five matches to none, and then
sent out two of its youngsters to
play the most exciting tennis of the
last five days.
Frank X. Shields, of New York,
who played the major role in the
United States victory, and Sidney
B. Wood, Jr., also of New York,
staged an exhibition after the final
two Davis Cup singles and battled
as though the Davis Cup instead of
the Chapultepec Cup depended on it
through two torrid sets.
Shields won G-0, 14-12, but he
was as exhausted as his victim when
the match was completed.
Wood, playing his best form, was
unable to win a game in the first
set, but he settled down to business
in the second and it was a fight for
every point.
