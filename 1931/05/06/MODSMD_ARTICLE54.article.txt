# BRAZILIAN JUNGLE CLAIMS AVIATOR'S LIFE AFTER CRASH
## Italian Fliers Fight Way Through Wilderness; One Is Rescued 
### 
SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 5. C/P) j
â€”The story of a 13-day journey I
through the wilderness on foot, end- i
ing in the rescue of Count Edmondo ;
Di Robilant, Italian flier, and the '
suicide of his mechanic, Mauranta j
Quaranta, stirred public interest to
day.
The Italian consul said Di Robi
lant told him that Quaranta hanged
himself to the limb of a tree with
his own belt rather than endure
longer the suffering of starvation
and fever. The fliers left Sao Paulo
April 12 and were forced down the
next day near Pirajury.
Forced Oown
Earlier reports said the mechanic j
died in a hospital at San Jose as a J
result of his experiences.
As told to the consul, the fliers i
encountered a storm four hours out i
of Sao Paulo and were forced down I
in the jungles due to a leakage of j
fuel. Leaving the plane undamaged,
they started back toward civilization j
with marmalade and hardtack as 1
their only provisions.
Hardships Related
Mosquitoes harassed them every |
foot of the way. Ants devoured their |
food. Constant wading of streams j
sapped their energy. Loss of their |
matches in the water left them with- I
out means to build a fire. They sub- \
sisted for days on what fish they ;
could catch with their hands and the i
fruit they could find.
On the eleventh day, Quaranta j
pleaded that he could go no farther :
and insisted that Di Robilant push !
on without him. The latter readied
the Parana river two days later and j
an Indian took him to San Jose by !
canoe.
In spite of his condition, Di Robi- j
lant returned the next day to where I
he left the mechanic and found his j
body hanging from a tree.
