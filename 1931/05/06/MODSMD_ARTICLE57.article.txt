## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (TP).—Sec
retary Mellon said today that the
solution to the present economic dis
tress would be found in individual
initiative, and not by "surrendering
the management of business and in
dustry to the government or to any
board or group of men."
Breaking a two year silence dur
ing which he has not discussed pub
licly the world-wide depression, the
veteran treasury secretary empha
sized that purchasing power was an
all-important factor and that power
"insofar as America is concerned, is
dependent to a great extent upon
the standard of living which obtains
in this country."
Mellon addressed a luncheon given
foreign bankers attending the In
ternational Chamber of Commerce
by the American Bankers' Associa
tion. He told them that each nation
must be allowed to work out in its
own way its solution to the eco
nomic problem.
"The troubles which all of us face
at this time cannot be cured by any
quick and easy method, or at some
one else's expense, and it is well to

I face the fact," he said.
"One must not under estimate the
j seriousness of the present Situation.
1 And yet, we must not lose our sense
of perspective, for we know that the
! present crisis is not unprecedented,
j but that on the contrary the world
is going through one of those transi-
I tion stages which come from time
, to time and entail drastic and far
I reaching economic readjustments."
The present crisis, the secretary
j continued, was more severe than
| most because it followed a world-
I war, but he said that in this country
I there had been an effort on the part
I of the government and private busi-
I ness not only to prevent reduction
j in wages but to keep the maximum
I number of men, employed.
Reviewing the improvement in
world-wide conditions, the secretary
said that much remained to be done.
"What we must strive for is to im
prove the standard both here and in
other countries as conditions war
rant.
