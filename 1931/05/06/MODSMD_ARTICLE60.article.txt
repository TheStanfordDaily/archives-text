This latest controversy over
officials, fouls, and starting in
Stanford-U.S.C. track meets,
while it may appear t osome as
a mountain on the horizon of
athlctic relations between these
two institutions, is in reality but
another molehill. However, it is
unfortunate occurrences such as
the Williams-llablcs incident
that lead to ruptures that in
jure both parties concerned as
well as the general sporting
public.
The Army had its row with the
Navy ovccomparatively small dif
ferences, and one of the greatest
football classics in the country was
lost to Mr. Fan. For the past several
years, Stanford and U.S.C. have
been the old-time Harvard and Yale
of the West. When two schools so
evenly matched on the track get
together, the possibility for accidents
increased, as well as the probability
of several close decisions which
can't please all of the fans.
Last year it was the start of
the century and the finish of
the 220 that marred the Troy-
Indian dual meet. Hec Dyer was
accused by sundry S.C. officials
and fans of jumping (be gun
when he beat out Wykoff in the
100-yard dash. Then the deci
sion recording a dead heat be
tween I ice and the "Glenilale
Express" over the longer dash
distance failed to satisfy the
S'tanford contingent, which was
of the opinion that Oyer had
crossed the line a healthy foot
ahead of Wykoff.
Before the meet last year, there
was not a little "to-do" between
Stanford and Troy moguls about the
location of the meet. Since the Coli
seum was under repair and there
fore not available, S.C. offered the
Occidental field as a suitable site.
Farm officials objected, and rumors
floated around that there would be
no meet on account of the disagree
ment. An agreement was finally
reached, and the affair was run off
at Oxy.
This year was not without its pre
meet controversy, the matter of a
starter acceptable to both institu
tions. First, "Red" Kelley, known as
one of the coast's best starters, was
turned down by S.C. because, ac
cording to those who are supposed
to be "in the know," Mr. Kelley is
Ihe only starter on the coast who
makes a special point of seeing to
it that Wykoff starts with the gun.
Be that as it may, Stanford then
iffered Boyd Comstock, L.A.A.C.
2oach, who was likewise not ac
ceptable to Troy. Comstock had had
i little quarrel of his own with the
Trojans a week before over a de
•ision-reversal which gave Southern
California a victory over his team
jy two points.
When Stanford, in despera
tion, suggested George Varnetl,
a competent official in Seattle,
U.S.C. came back to ask why,
if they must go far afiield to
secure a starter, they couldn't
get Johnny McHugh to come out
from the Atlantic shores to fill
the assignment! Finally, Bob
Strehle, Pomonoa coach, was
accepted.
All this official harranguing, to
jethor with certain unofficial re
narks being tossed around about
ootball players, coaches, and sub
idization, are breaking down the
rue spirit of sporting competition
letween two great rivals. It's inter
sting to be an unofficial partici
iant in such squabbles, but to keep
t from precipitating any sort of
thletic rupture, let's take the breaks
s they fall and satisfy our revenge
ppetite by fighting it out on the j
thletic field in future contests.
Vic Williams, the man who
pushed his way out of the per
fect box prepared for him by
Les Ilables and Maynor Shove
on the homestretch of the quar
ter-mile, added a touch of hu
mor to the whole situation by a
statement something like this:
"As I came up behind Ilables I
merely put my hand out to keep
from spiking him. I see no rea
son why a runner should be dis
qualified for taking care not to
injure a rival athlete." Tut, tut, !
Mr. Williams, such a sudden at
tack of big-hcartedness.
