## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 5 (/P).â€”George
F. Baker, powerful figure of -Wall
Street and among its most unas
suming, was buried today in- Ken
sico Cemetery on the Hudson. The
funeral was characteristic of the
simplicity of his life, just as his po
sition in finance was implied by the
list of distinguished men who at
tended.

The service for the 91 -year-old fi
nancier lasted little more than half
an hour. There was a hymn, a
prayer, another hymn and that was
all. There were no eulogies and no
honorary pallbearers.
