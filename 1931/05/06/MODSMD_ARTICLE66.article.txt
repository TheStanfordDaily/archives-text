# IN THE SPOTLIGHT
## Hornsby May Be Trouble-Maker and "Chiseler," But He's Swell Batter and Fighting Manager 
### Feg Murray, '16 
This fellow Hornsby may be a '
trouble-maker, a "chiseler," a handi- (
cap to a team, I don't know, but 1 i
do know that he's a swell batter, a ;
fair-to-middling fielder, a grand J
manager and a two-fisted fighter
who always wants to win, and who ;
gives the best that's in him in order
to achieve the desired results.
To play with four different teams !
in four years, is something, but to
manage, even temporarily or as an j
assistant, each of those teams in five {
years is quite a record. The Rajah
led the Cards to a pennant and
world's championship in 1926, he j
managed the Giants while McGraw
was laid up in 1.927, he soon was ,
made manager of the Braves after
being traded to that team by the '
Giants in 1928 and he managed the
Cubs at the end of his second season
with them in 1930. Wotta Man!
As a batter, the Texas Tornado
has been even more successful than !

jas a manager, and it's too soon to
pass final judgment on his career
j as either a player or a manager, for
; now he's acting as both, and leading
the Cubs to—perhaps—the 1931 Na
tional League pennant. 'Way back
in 1922 he created a National League
! home run record of 42. In 1924 he
set a modern major league batting
mark of .4235. As he had hi I .397
in 1921, .401 in 1922, .384 in 1923,
and .403 in 1925, he had an average
j of .402 for five consecutive years!
In 1926 he lost his National League
batting championship, after leading
the league for six straight years, but
j he had good company in defeat, for
Bobby Jones, Jack Dempsey, Helen
Wills, Bill Tilden and other ruling
■ monarchs were also dethroned that
1 year. The Rajah came back to lead
| again in 1928, and don't be surprised
if he's up there again at the end of
j this season, tying Hans Wagner's
■ record of leading the league eight
I times.
