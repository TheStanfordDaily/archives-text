# CARD RELAY TEAM TO SEEK RECORD AT FRESNO MEET
## Owens Launches Inquiry To Determine Details Of 440 Incident 
### Lowell Cox 
Ben Eastman will not go after the
world record in the half-mile at the
Fresno relays Saturday, but he will
aid the Indian quarter-milers in an
attempt to set a new world mark in
the mile relay.
This was indicated at practice yes
terday, when Dink Templeton an
nounced that the Indians would con
centrate on two events at Fresno,
the half-mile and the mile relay.
Special Event Dropped
Fresno officials had announced a
special half-mile event so that East
man could seek a record in the two
lap run, but Templeton has decided
against this.
Chances are excellent, however,
that the existing record in the mile
relay will fall. Shove, the Hables
brothers and Eastman traveled the
four laps in 3:14.3 seconds against
U.S.C. last Saturday, smashing the
American record, in spite of gruel
ing races earlier in the program.
At Fresno Shove and Ike Hables
may not enter any other event,
while Eastman and Hables will only
compete in the half-mile relay, run
ning 220 yards apiece. Since the
shorter race precedes the mile even
by an hour, the Indian quartet
should be in perfect condition to go
after the world mark of 3:13.4 sec
onds.
Fast Enough
When asked yesterday if he were
seeking a new mark in the event,
Dink replied: "Well, they'll be run
ning as fast as they can!" And that
should be fast enough.
As for the half-mile relay, the
team will be composed of Lom
bardi, Dyer, Les Hables and East
man. With all four capable of bet
ter than even time, including East
man, a Stanford victory can be
looked for.
Teams will be entered in other
events, but it is on these two that
Templeton is concentrating.
"Podge" Smith, still being careful
of the leg which cramped to cost
him a place in the low hurdles
against U.S.C., expects to compete
at Fresno.
Investigation Launched
Meanwhile Professor William
Owens is launching an investigation
to determine just what happened on
the final turn in the quarter-mile
race last Saturday. He issued the
following formal statement yester
day:
"We raise no question as to the
result of the meet or any event as
determined by the decisions of the
judges or referee. The question has
been raised in regard to the quali
fications of an inspector on the turn
in the 440. We desire to investigate
this fully and to establish if possible
just what did happen on the turn."

At Fresno Shove and Ike Hables
may not enter any other event,
while Eastman and Hables will only
compete in the half-mile relay, run
ning 220 yards apiece. Since the
shorter race precedes the mile even
by an hour, the Indian quartet
should be in perfect condition to go
after the world mark of 3:13.4 sec
onds.
Fast Enough
When asked yesterday if he were
seeking a new mark in the event,
Dink replied: "Well, they'll be run
ning as fast as they can!" And that
should be fast enough.
As for the half-mile relay, the
team will be composed of Lom
bardi, Dyer, Les Hables and East
man. With all four capable of bet
ter than even time, including East
man, a Stanford victory can be
looked for.
Teams will be entered in other
events, but it is on these two that
Templeton is concentrating.
"Podge" Smith, still being careful
of the leg which cramped to cost
him a place in the low hurdles
against U.S.C., expects to compete
at Fresno.
Investigation Launched
Meanwhile Professor William
Owens is launching an investigation
to determine just what happened on
the final turn in the quarter-mile
race last Saturday. He issued the
following formal statement yester
day:
"We raise no question as to the
result of the meet or any event as
determined by the decisions of the
judges or referee. The question has
been raised in regard to the quali
fications of an inspector on the turn
in the 440. We desire to investigate
this fully and to establish if possible
just what did happen on the turn."
Ben Eastman will not go after the
world record in the half-mile at the
Fresno relays Saturday, but he will
aid the Indian quarter-milers in an
attempt to set a new world mark in
the mile relay.
This was indicated at practice yes
terday, when Dink Templeton an
nounced that the Indians would con
centrate on two events at Fresno,
the half-mile and the mile relay.
Special Event Dropped
Fresno officials had announced a
special half-mile event so that East
man could seek a record in the two
lap run, but Templeton has decided
against this.
Chances are excellent, however,
that the existing record in the mile
relay will fall. Shove, the Hables
brothers and Eastman traveled the
four laps in 3:14.3 seconds against
U.S.C. last Saturday, smashing the
American record, in spite of gruel
ing races earlier in the program.
