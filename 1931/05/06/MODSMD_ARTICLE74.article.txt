# S.A.E., SOUTHERNERS III DEFAULTED INTO QUARTER-FINALS IN INTRAMURAL TENNIS
## 
### 
Filling the only two remaining va- |
cancies in the quarter-final round I
of the intramural tennis tournament, \
both Sigma Alpha Epsilon and j
Southerners 111 were given defaults i
yesterday. So far, S.A.E. has ad- i
vanced without playing a match, '
while the Southerners gained their j
first victory over El Cuadro and j
their second through yesterday's de- 1
fault.
These two defaults were handed
out because of the failure of four ,
teams even to settle their first round
encounters. The offenders causing •
the rapid rise of S.A.E. and the
Southerners are Encina 3W (1), Phi
Gamma Delta, Kappa Sigma and

1 Breakers. The first two were sched-
I uled to meet each other, then to
j meet the winner of a contest be- I
j tween the second two, but the
1 matches never took plat^e.
Four teams in the quarter-finals
j must now play off their contests to i
; fill the semi-final brackets alongside
| Sigma Nu and Southerners 11. Coach
I Elwyn Bugge urges these players to j
J arrange their matches as quickly as
possible.
Only one change of importance
I has occurred recently on the fresh
man ladder. Leigh ton Johnson, who
• has climbed rapidly from twelfth
place, defeated Joe Melczer by a
6-2, 6-2 score to gain eighth po
sition.
