# SEAVER-LITTLE TO PLAY SEMI-FINAL MATCH SATURDAY
## MacNaughton-Hillman To Play Thursday, Friday; Finals Sunday 
### 
' The long awaited golfing clash be-
I tween Lawson Little and Charles
Seaver, which was assured when
i both men reached the semi-finals
I of the University tournament last
| week, will take place next Saturday.
This means that Farm golf en
| thusiasts will have a much better
j chance to see this feature match, as
; all 36 1 loles will be played in one
day, and that a convenient one. It
1 also means that the tourney's final
i match, which looms as another "nat
! ural,' will have to be held over till
| Sunday.
i The other semi-final match be
tween Herman Hellman and Mal
colm MacNaughton is to be played
in two installments on Thursday and
Friday afternoons. Because Hell
i man's recalcitrant putter has started
to function of late, McNaughton is
no longer the top heavy favorite to
come through to the final bracket.
