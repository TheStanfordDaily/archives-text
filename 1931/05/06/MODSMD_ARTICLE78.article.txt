was to be at Tokatan, Urup Island,
in the Kuriles, northeast of Japan.
From there he planned to hop to
Kataoka Bay, 448 miles northeast
of Tokotan.
Yoshihara left Haneda airdrome,
Tokyo, on the first leg of his flight
yesterday. He landed at Numaoaki,
Hokkaido Island, a few hours later
and continued to this port today.
The flier expects eventually to de
liver to President Hoover at Wash
ington goodwill messages from Pre
mier Wakatsuki of Japan and other
prominent Japanese, including Seiji
Noma, magazine king and principal
backer of the flight.
