# WOMEN ARE 'DOCTORS' Broken Bones Plague '500' MUTUAL AID SOLICITED
## 
### 
Broken bones—arms, legs, necks,
and thighs—have become almost an
epidemic among the Stanford wom
en. And with great facility a broken
i hip can become a broken finger al
-1 most over night. Two days later the
patient is suffering from a dislo
cated collar-bone.
i All this in the interests of science.
In fact the plague has been so wide
i spread, that the women are being
j trained as rapidly as possible to
| properly set the bones of their in
i jured sisters. One member of the
: "500" can be found solicitously ban
daging another who is attempting to
! be a very brave patient.
j The remarkable part of the pro
j ceedings is that the "doctor" of one
1 day becomes the sufferer on the
next. Here is an example of real
efficiency. And it all comes about
j in Dr. Dyment's advanced personal
hygiene class. Who says there are
j no miracles?
