Featuring a talk on commercial
aviation by Captain "Bill" Royle of
the Alameda air port, Scabbard and
Blade, honorary military fraternity,
held a smoker for upper division
military students at 7:15 o'clock last
night in the lobby of the Old Union.
In discussing the importance of
competent training for the air ser
vice, Captain Royle said:
'Commercial aviation will not
function at its best till headed by
men of long experience. There is
no better place to get this training
than in the Army and Navy training
camps.
"The majority of prominent avia
tors have had military training.
Nearly ninety per ccnt of commer
cial flyers in the Bay District would
like to have a reserve commission,
If you are lucky enough to get a
commission, keep it up!"
