"Lamb stew and more lamb stew. ]
Aw hell!" The cautious and wily I
Daily reporter crept nearer to the j
trundle bed from which the little :
speaker was surveying the ruin of !
a perfectly good stamping ground I
and muttering his caustic observa- :
tions on life to his neighbors. The 1
reporter yearned to know all.
"Think they're doing us a favor. |
huh? Rats!" exploded the dimpled ,
cherub. "Back where I come from <
college students has got better things
to do than come around ruining i
kids' places to get dirty in. And j
look at the windows the wee j
tot's voice rose to a plaintive wail, i
"Who can draw pitchers on clean
windows; who?
"And, didja hear that ol' band :
concert that was sure swell, special 1
for us. Geez, when that funny look- |
ing guy with that' horn thing i
wrapped around his head nearly '
bust himself trying to blow the J
thing, me and Jimmie nearly had a |

| fit. The Stanford Band—geez, we can
j do that with combs and things. An'
( dincha enjoy watching those smarty
| alecks fall off ladders and spill paint
i all over. I'd sure like to help paint.
"Then this barbecue mess. Honest,
that's the thing that I can't see. Eat.
1 that's what they do the fastest. Who
can cop the most ice cream 'stead of
I how much lamb we have ta eat from
i now on. If this is supposed to be for
j charity, why don't they eat the
I beans and meat, and leave us the
I ice cream?
I "When I grow up I ain't never
i going to college. Didja see the fooey
i stunts they called a show? Gee,
you'd think Stanford would at least
, teach 'em some good jokes. Gosh—"
: the toughened philosopher dropped
his mantle of cynicism before a not
too-pseudo wistfulness "Gosh,
j there they all go in their roadsters
| and trucks, and it'll be a year before
j they come back. Aw, I hate every
thing to be quiet again."
