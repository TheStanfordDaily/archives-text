WASHINGTON, May ti (£>).—'The
effort of the International Chamber

mote a resumption of prosperity fo
cused today on questions of regular
ization of employment, wages and
mass production.
Also there came the first out

Gerard Swope, president of the
General Electric Company, climaxed
his morning address with the stale
client that industry belatedly has be
\ gun to recognize it is responsible for
regularizing employment.
The president of the European
Steel Cartel, Aloyse Meyer of Lux
j emburg, said it was of little conse
quence to workers if their income
changed, so long as the cost of liv
ing altered proportionately.

"nominal wage." He concluded:

"The general tendency may and
; should be directed toward high real
wages, but economic conditions,
stronger than any theory, impose
I the measure which must not be ex
i ceeded without endangering the
general economic balance of a coun
try."
While agreeing with warnings that
American mass production methods
cannot be invoked indiscriminately
in Europe, Oskar Sempell, chairman
of the German Steel Cartel, said it
was necessary to apply these meth
ods in some instances or else dis
continue production. He termed the
alternative of reliance upon the do
mestic market alone, under protec
tion of high tariffs, an impractica
bility.
