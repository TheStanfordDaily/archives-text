I lie enforcement of Hie Stanford Honor Code rests
with the men's and women's councils. For the adequate !
and vigorous enforcement of the (-ode, if is imperative
that fiie membership of these two councils be made up of
intelligent and alxle students who earnestly and sincerely!
seek that end.
On February 27, the two present councils decided that
the minimum penalty for convicted Honor Code violators'
would be three quarters' suspension from Hie University, j
and that second conviction would be penalized by perma-j
nenf expulsion from the I niversify. 'When the councils
met on March (>, to consider the cases of four students!
charged with violating the ('ode, their firm stand of the |
week before was not maintained. Two students, found
guilty, were sentenced to two quarters' suspension, instead
of the minimum of three quarters.
Commenting on that situation, The Daily at the time'
said: "The situation is simply this: Stanford lias a pair j
of student councils which lack the strength to act in a
crucial test of their announced policies." The members of
those councils are now in office. But on May 12 will he
elected three new members of men's council to replace
three of the incumbents. Today is the second and final j
day of the period for nominating candidates for these'
four positions. For adequate, intelligent, and courageous j
enforcement of the Honor Code, students must be nomi
nated and elected who will carry out this policy. Sow /.*
the time.
