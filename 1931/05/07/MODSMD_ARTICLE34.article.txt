# TOO MUCH WRANGLING
## 
### 
Jusf when Stanford had decided not to protest the meet
with Southern California last Saturday, the only decision
it could possibly have made, good old Dean Cromwell of
the I rojans decides to keep the issue open. Yesterday's
dailies carried stories of the Gloomy Dean's outburst â€”

something to do with the now-famous quarter-mile race.
According to Cromwell, not only did Ilablcs deliberately
attempt to (Jraw Williams into folding him, but Pearson
of Southern California, also in the race, was elbowed oft"
the track on the back stretch. Furthermore, flic Trojan
track coach declares, any quarter-mile in which his men
compete against Stanford in the future will be run in lanes,
or Southern California simply will not play.
II is a great pitv that Stanford and Southern California
cannot get together in athletic competition without un
pleasant circumstances cropping up. Wrangling of all sorts
has characterized the Indian-Trojan battles of the past few
years, and laid the foundation for the feeling thai exists
among the students of the two universities. That feeling is
certainly not one of friendly collegiate rivalry, as it most
certainly should be.

The Daily obviously cannot undertake place I lie blame
for these wrangles, since il is viewing the situation from a
Stanford angle. Hut a few more incidents like Saturday's
affair are apt to make an open break with Troy almost
inevitable.
