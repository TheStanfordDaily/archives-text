# CONVALESCENT HOME FOR STUDENTS
## 
### 
Men's and women's rest homes are a unique and fairly
recent addition to the campus. So far this year, they have
proved their value to 2.'SO students. Unfortunately, many
do not seem to know that these homes exist for any student
who wants complete rest and isolation for a few days.
Most of those who use the rest homes are really ill, but
many more are just physically worn out and need sleep
and home cooking.
Without the help of the administration, the Stanford
Mothers' ( July organized the men's rest home at Mrs. H. C.
Carr's and the women's rest home at Mrs. L. .1. Owen's only
three years ago. Since that time, a committee from the
club has taken complete charge of the maintenance of the
homes even to caring for students unable to pay the regu
lar charge of *1 a day.
From 2 until fji.'JO o'clock this afternoon, the Mothers'
Club will hold its third annual garden party, for mainte
nance of the two homes, in the gardens of Mrs. Albert S.
Robinson and Mrs. (iuv Shoup at Los Altos. The whole
organization is expending every effort to make this as suc
cessful as both previous teas. Their purpose and work
merit the sincere appreciation of the student bodv.
