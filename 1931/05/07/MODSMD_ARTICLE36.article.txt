REVOLT AT YALE
• (The Nation)
It ought to be a matter of more
- than passing concern to Ihe mem
bers and friends of Yale that the
thing which has put the university
' "on the map" during the present
[ i academic year is not the pronounce
. ments of its president or governing
: boards regarding educational policy
nor the scholarly achievements of
its faculty, but the pungent criti
, cism of its methods and ideals by
-i the editors of an undergraduate
! publication.
.; Harvard has a reputation for in-
I dulging at times in rather frank
I self-criticism, but the extremist
; outbursts ever heard at Cambridge
, j seem feeble and timid in compari
j son with the drastic excoriation of
: Yale methods and Yale men which
! has been administered by the Hark
ness Hoot. In the latest issue of ihat
publication one of its editors, Wil
liam Harlan Hale, returns to the
charge in a valedictory well calcu
lated to scorch the toughest aca
! demie hide.
j What Mr. Hale complains of is
■ that Yale does little or nothing to
; foster individual culture, and that
the ideals which it folluws and the
j methods it uses are such as to make
such culture all but impossible. In
stead of confining its efforts to the
comparatively few who are able to
respond to them, it has gone in for
■ mass production and welcomed Ihc
j unfit in larger numbers than the
I fit.
j It has lavished money on mongrel
1 architecture and grandiose schemes
| for synthesizing "human relations,"
I while ignoring the intellectual qual
i ity of its faculty and saturating its
i instruction with formalism. The re
sulting paucity of intellectual and
j social interest is now to be met by
inagurating an imitation of the Ox
ford college, and herding groups of
: students in houses where, under the
j benign supervision of selected mem
bers of the professoriate, the culture
and social solidarity of gentlemen
J are expected to grow; all this,
i meantime, with the harassing re
j striction of an outgrown four-year
course studded with elementary re
j quired subjects, and of accumulating
! endowments for the maintenance of
1 useless show.
j The situation of New Haven is
I not, unhappily, unique. Yale has
| yielded to the same educational
trend which, with most American
i universities, has been a fatal lure,
i If it has not gone in for the danger
! of superficiality of the Meiklejohn
( Experimental College at Wisconsin,
lor aped the educational novelties j
. that Rollins College seems to prize,
: or offered the imposing bill of fare
I which Columbia spreads out, it has
! nevertheless dallied with education ;
! in ways that stir amazement and i
j invite rebuke. The rebuke now
j comes from a senior who, examin- I
I ing the bread which has been j
handed out to him for four years,
finds it a stone.

The indictment has importance
far beyond the academic limits of
Yale. It matters a good deal to our
national life that a great university,
rich beyond avarice in present
wealth and in reasonably assured
access to more, should seem to its
thoughtful undergraduates to have
done so little to develop the proper
function of a university and sub
ordinated intellectual enrichment to
academic formalism, grandiloquent
notions of organizing the incongru
ous, and material display.
The revolt of youth against the
education that is offered to it is, a
warning of intellectual discontent
which no university can afford to
ignore, for unless such evils as have
been courageously exposed at Yale
are done away with, the revolt is
likely to carry far and wide.
