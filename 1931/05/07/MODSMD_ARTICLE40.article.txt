# CAMPUS OPINION
## SHORT-SIGHTED DOCTRINES 
### 
| The Editor, Sir:
j Well, folks, it looks as though the
I Honorable William Randolph Hearst
I has bought out the Daily! Yesterday,
readers of Campus Opinion had to
i wade through the garbled thoughts
! of one Fred J. Monteagle, who, in a
! very cheap sort of way, lauded Abe
j Mellinkoff, editor of the Bull Ses
! sion, on his League of Nations stand.
To comprehend such illogical tripe
|as Mr. Monteagle writes, one only
needs to know that the individual is
. the campus correspondent for a
Hearst newspaper.
Mr. Mellinkoff is undoubtedly one
| of the ablest thinkers on the Stan-
I ford campus. Mellinkoff has, in a
logical fashion, disapproved of the
; League of Nations. But along comes
Mr. Monteagle with the short
! sighted dostrines of Mr. Hearst to
! argue that since the Bull Session
editor disapproves of the League, it
is prima facie evidence that he like
| wise denounces the World Court
(Monteagle calls it the League
Court).
Mr. Mellinkoff may actually look
down upon the World Court, too,
but it is certainly unfair to assume,
as Monteagle does, that Mellinkoff
will endorse and use the absurd
Hearstian logic.
Sincerely, W. A. Roberts.
