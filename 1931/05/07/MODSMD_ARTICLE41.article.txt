# HURRAH FOR MR. HEARST!
## 
### 
; The Editor, Sir:
Hurrah for • Mr. Hearst! Three
cheers for Mr. F. J. Monteagle, cam
j pus correspondent of a well-known
; San Francisco paper, who so gal
i lantly advocates "American Papers
I for American People."
Either Mr. Monteagle is being
subtly sacrastic, ever so subtle, of
Mi-. Mellinkoff's stand on American
participation in the League, or he is
revealing an ignorance of astonish
; ing depth concerning certain raat-
I ters. Personally I am more willing
!to believe statements of Professor
Nicholas Murray Butler, Elihu Root,
J Charles Hughes, etc., than I am
willing to take stock in catchy, but
meaningless, phrases.
This eager reader requests Mr.
Monteagle to inform him as to what
the "sham of internationalism" might
I be and who might, be doing the
[ shamming, if any, and what an
| "American Paper for American Peo
[ pie" might be.
II is my belief that Mr. Monteagle
has never read the Covenant of the
, League of Nations (including Article
I 10 to which he refers). It is an an-
I cient custom, although not a laud
able one, to quote several selected
words of a statement which will
support, the writer's views and to
ignore anything in the same state-
I merit which could in any way give
the statement's true intent. I refer
Mr. Monteagle to Article X of the
Covenant of the League of Nations
(all five lines of it).
I wish to point out that any de
cision of policy of the League can
be made only by the Council by
UNANIMOUS vote. In view of the
unanimity necessary before any ac
tion can be taken, every member of
the League represented on the
[Council has an ABSOLUTE VETO
in all such matters.
Carried away by the sound of a
i song title, Mr. Monteagle has made
a laughable mistake, revealing ig
norance of the nature of the Inter
nationale, which he claims would be
suggested to replace the Star-Span
gled Banner; it is evident that Mr.
Monteagle does not realize that the
Internationale is the song of the
Communistic party and not of the
League. The greatest communistic
power in the world today—Russia—
is not a member of the League and
co-operates with League activities
even less than does the United
States.
I would suggest that Mr. Mont
eagle avail himself of a bit of in
formation before striking so vio
lently at an institution praised by
all who are members and many
leaders of those nations which are
not members. I believe that a more
intelligent article might be written
after a reading of the Covenant of
the League which can be obtained
for the huge sum of five cents. If
Mr. Monteagle desires to read a
copy of the "constitution of the
League" and finds it at all incon
venient in any way to obtain one,
I will be glad !o present him with
one. —Leonard Effron.

the statement's true intent. I refer
Mr. Monteagle to Article X of the
Covenant of the League of Nations
(all five lines of it).
I wish to point out that any de
cision of policy of the League can
be made only by the Council by
UNANIMOUS vote. In view of the
unanimity necessary before any ac
tion can be taken, every member of
the League represented on the
[Council has an ABSOLUTE VETO
in all such matters.
Carried away by the sound of a
i song title, Mr. Monteagle has made
a laughable mistake, revealing ig
norance of the nature of the Inter
nationale, which he claims would be
suggested to replace the Star-Span
gled Banner; it is evident that Mr.
Monteagle does not realize that the
Internationale is the song of the
Communistic party and not of the
League. The greatest communistic
power in the world today—Russia—
is not a member of the League and
co-operates with League activities
even less than does the United
States.
I would suggest that Mr. Mont
eagle avail himself of a bit of in
formation before striking so vio
lently at an institution praised by
all who are members and many
leaders of those nations which are
not members. I believe that a more
intelligent article might be written
after a reading of the Covenant of
the League which can be obtained
for the huge sum of five cents. If
Mr. Monteagle desires to read a
copy of the "constitution of the
League" and finds it at all incon
venient in any way to obtain one,
I will be glad !o present him with
one. —Leonard Effron.
; The Editor, Sir:
Hurrah for • Mr. Hearst! Three
cheers for Mr. F. J. Monteagle, cam
j pus correspondent of a well-known
; San Francisco paper, who so gal
i lantly advocates "American Papers
I for American People."
Either Mr. Monteagle is being
subtly sacrastic, ever so subtle, of
Mi-. Mellinkoff's stand on American
participation in the League, or he is
revealing an ignorance of astonish
; ing depth concerning certain raat-
I ters. Personally I am more willing
!to believe statements of Professor
Nicholas Murray Butler, Elihu Root,
J Charles Hughes, etc., than I am
willing to take stock in catchy, but
meaningless, phrases.
This eager reader requests Mr.
Monteagle to inform him as to what
the "sham of internationalism" might
I be and who might, be doing the
[ shamming, if any, and what an
| "American Paper for American Peo
[ pie" might be.
II is my belief that Mr. Monteagle
has never read the Covenant of the
, League of Nations (including Article
I 10 to which he refers). It is an an-
I cient custom, although not a laud
able one, to quote several selected
words of a statement which will
support, the writer's views and to
ignore anything in the same state-
I merit which could in any way give
the statement's true intent. I refer
