j The modern cry in all fields in the
I truth—the whole truth—and nothing
I but the truth. Men take great joy
and even pain in dedicating their
1 lives to the pursuit of truth. And
j everywhere, the truth is held to be
: the highest possible virtue. Modern
mothers must tell their children thut
Santa Claus is a myth so at the very
outset the little darlings will not be
confronted with falsehoods.
In the field of literary history, we
find certain authors that take evi
j dent delight in blasting America's
I idols. They no doubt justify them
| selves on the grounds of telling the
: truth. Now when it aids advance of
! mankind, to have the unadulter
j ated facts—let us have them. There
are, however, certain harmless false
hoods that we have been taught
I since the grade schools which these j
modern apostles of truth seem de
termined to destroy.
These idol breakers have each !
grabbed a heavy cross of truth, and i
to the tune of "It may be heavy; !
but it surely pays," have methodi- j
cally proceeded to destroy golden
traditions that surrounded some of
what we used to be told were J
America's greatest men. We now j
learn that Washington did not chop i
down the cherry tree. They'will, or:
perhaps they have already claimed, j
that Lincoln did not split rails. Now
these men as MEN have no signifi- j
cance today; as glorified personages, j
however, they do have a place to j
fill in the folklore of the nation that

\is important. Why destroy these
; myths? They do no positive harm
j and it is enjoyable and somewhat
j stimulating to think that there were
i once presidents who were not pos
sessed of all the terrible faults that
editors claim—and probably with
i justification—recent presidents have
j been afflicted with.
j The only possible danger in hold
[ ing to these false myths, is that the
1 present generation will become so
bound to the ideas that these men
of a past era held, that little prog
ress from their obsolete concepts
will ever be achieved. There is little
danger from this score, however, if
these gentlemen that fight for the
truth (in books from which they
extract juicy royalties) will confine
I their efforts to a criticism of anti
j quated ideas held by these men,
| leaving their personal and mythical
j lives to be enjoyed and veneratad
I by the less-knowing and not so all
i wise populace.
On the other hand, there ai'c a
j host of current myths which play a
| vital and harmful part in public af
: fairs which should be destroyed
I without mercy. Such foolish notions
; to the effect that Calvin Coolidge's
I economy caused prosperity; or that
j in matters of efficiency first came
j the Creator and then the great silent
: man from Massachusetts; or that
| Herbert Hoover is the cause of
j the present depression—such com-
I mon ideas should be summarily
squelched. —Abe Mellinkoff.
