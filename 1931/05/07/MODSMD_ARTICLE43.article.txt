### 
SHIPMATES—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Robert Montgomery proves in
"Shipmates" that he is a star to be
watched, for future success. Al
though the story is not too good,
and has its obvious weaknesses
which make it drag at times, on the
whole the picture is one of the best
—at least this month.
It concerns the experiences of a
young sailor, youthfully cocky in
love affairs as well as on board ship.
After enough excitement, during
which he proves his worth, to last
the average person a lifetime, he
wins an appointment to Annapolis,
and the cheerful forgiveness of his
erstwhile "villainous" enemies.
Cliff Edwards, Ernest Torrence,
Dorothy Jordan, and Eddie Nugent
who unfortunately makes an early
exit, compose a supporting cast that
really warrants a better story.

A TAILOR MADE MAN—At the
Varsity Theatre.
This is the first show we have
seen for a long time which is in
describably awful. If we did not
have to say something to justify our
existence we would add a keep-off
warning and leave it at that.
William Haines has, in the course
of his carer, been funny, but this
is a part so utterly unsuited to him,
or anyone else for that matter, that
it is hard to believe it. He and
every other character mumbles and
jumbles lines which never were
worth speaking. The photography is

reminiscent of that of ten years ago
and the plot and the action drag
along interminably through about
an hour of the most hopelessly slow
going that it has ever been our mis
fortune to see.

As if to add insult to injury the
main feature was accompanied by
a comedy sprinkled freely with the
sort of bright scraps of witty con
versation of the average high-school
freshman who has been bitten by
the "collegiate" bug. In order to
make the whole program entirely
unbearable an elderly bloke with an
incipient beard and an insipid voice
very kindly took the audience by
the hand through "picturesque"
Morocco. —S.C.A.
