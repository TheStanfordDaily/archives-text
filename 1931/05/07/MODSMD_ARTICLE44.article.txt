# CABBAGES and Things..
## 
### 
what blisters godohgod who made
i cross cut saws and broom handles
with splinters in them anyhow its
| one thing to be noble and another to
act plain dumb about it it was hot
j out there yesterday and they
wouldnt give away anything lor
\ nothing except buckets of soapy
water to clean things in

why gosh its even so had
theres no way of telling which
are the convalescent kiddies to
day and which of us are just
grown up enough to escape be
ing called that who feels like one
more deed of mercy today if you
do call at the hospital late this
afternoon and ask for cabbages
theyll probably put you in the
psychopathic ward which will
he a sad shame but we sincerely
expect to he ensconced there by
four and youll at least have died
for the cause
wonder why it is the band always
sounds better out at the homo on
labor day than any other time of
the year maybe its the suggestion
of stars and stripes forever i mean
the stars are around your head and
theres a prospect of stripes for a
shirker meaning a prison sentence

along with the funny little boys who
get a bang out of burning hay stack:
of course there really isnt a
lot to do besides study these
evenings and without even a
miniature lake we're sort of
thrown on our own resources
without even enough energy to
bounce but there are lots of
more unattractive things than
perfectly good haystacks to
wreak your vengeance on have
we ever mentioned to you our
notion that the gates at the end
of palm drive are rather abomin
able of course we're paying only
$:50(H)0 for them since we're a
poverty stricken institution

maybe it is spring thats getting
into our blood after all the long
evenings are bad and love is bad for
any guy whos working his way
through college which reminds us of
another ode to the well besmirched
college professor it seems that an
astronomer is any man who can
look at a may moon and not fall in
love that is a subtle joke what with
venus in the sky all the time and
everything

the poor old colyum is getting
feeble in its last days thank the
lord there are only about six
more weeks till gabriel swain
blows his graduation trumpet
and all will be well or hell with
our souls

the poor old colyum is getting
feeble in its last days thank the
lord there are only about six
more weeks till gabriel swain
blows his graduation trumpet
and all will be well or hell with
our souls
what blisters godohgod who made
i cross cut saws and broom handles
with splinters in them anyhow its
| one thing to be noble and another to
act plain dumb about it it was hot
j out there yesterday and they
wouldnt give away anything lor
\ nothing except buckets of soapy
water to clean things in

why gosh its even so had
theres no way of telling which
are the convalescent kiddies to
day and which of us are just
grown up enough to escape be
ing called that who feels like one
more deed of mercy today if you
do call at the hospital late this
afternoon and ask for cabbages
theyll probably put you in the
psychopathic ward which will
he a sad shame but we sincerely
expect to he ensconced there by
four and youll at least have died
for the cause
wonder why it is the band always
sounds better out at the homo on
labor day than any other time of
the year maybe its the suggestion
of stars and stripes forever i mean
the stars are around your head and
theres a prospect of stripes for a
shirker meaning a prison sentence

along with the funny little boys who
get a bang out of burning hay stack:
of course there really isnt a
lot to do besides study these
evenings and without even a
miniature lake we're sort of
thrown on our own resources
without even enough energy to
bounce but there are lots of
more unattractive things than
perfectly good haystacks to
wreak your vengeance on have
we ever mentioned to you our
notion that the gates at the end
of palm drive are rather abomin
able of course we're paying only
$:50(H)0 for them since we're a
poverty stricken institution

maybe it is spring thats getting
into our blood after all the long
evenings are bad and love is bad for
any guy whos working his way
through college which reminds us of
another ode to the well besmirched
college professor it seems that an
astronomer is any man who can
look at a may moon and not fall in
love that is a subtle joke what with
venus in the sky all the time and
everything
