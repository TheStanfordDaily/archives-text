# Dink Points for Relay Marks at Fresno Meet
## TEMPLETON FLAYS 440 LANE SYSTEM PROPOSED BY S.C. Indian Entry To Be Strong At Fresno In Relays, Sprints, Hurdles 
### Fritz Goodwin 
! With Stanford runners
! first places in hurdles, sprints, and
relays against Southern California,
I L.A.A.C., and various unattached
| athletes, the relay meet at Fresno
Saturday may easily produce some
thing new in the way of Pacific
Coast or national track records.
Dink Templeton has signified his
intention of concentrating on two
relay events, the mile and the half
j mile, and, pressed by the fleet boys
I from the southern part of the state,
the Indians should rise to great
' heights in winning these races.
Fastest Collegians
Maynor • Shove, Les Hables, Ike
; Hables, and Ben Eastman ran the
j mile relay faster against Troy than
I any college team has ever done be-
I fore, breaking the .tape in 3:14.3, a
j new American mark, just a few
l tenths of a second slower than the
world's record. They will face the
j same Trojan quartet which drove
| them to this time at Fresno, plus a
■ team from L.A.A.C., and such com
| petition should aid the Indians in
| bettering the fastest time ever re
| corded for the event.
Hec Dyer, Les Hables, Frank
Lombardi, and either Ralph Giber
| son or Jim Howell should be at least
j the equal of any four 220 men en
] tered in the 880-yard relay at the
; Raisin City oval.
Points in Sprints
Dyer, Hables, and Lombardi ought
! to collect more points in the dashes
j than they did in the Trojan dual
meet. Dyer is determined to score a
[ double victory over Frank Wykoff
| of U.S.C., and Hables and Lombardi
! are potentially greater sprinters
| than Delby of Troy.
Hurdles will produce thrills among
the spectators at Fresno, with Cap
tain Podge Smith and A1 Nisbet of
: Stanford; Maxwell, Wendell Smith,
j and Welch of L.A.A.C.; and Stokes,
Carls, and Payne of S.C. all col
lected on one track.
Objects to Lanes
In regard to a statement of Coach
! Dean Cromwell's that Trojan run
| ners would never meet Stanford in
a 440 again unless the race were run ,
1 in lanes, Templeton stated yesterday
j that he would certainly object to j
such a suggestion, should it arise at ,
(he California Intercollegiates in I
Los Angeles.
"A 440 run in lanes would be no
; race at all," said Templeton. "Points
! might just as well be given after a
I series of time trials." Th© lane sys- !
| tem would necessitate stepping the
j starting lines, so that the runners |
would not see their normal position j
i in the race until they reached the i
j final stretch.
Cromwell on Boxing
Cromwell, in his press statement i
jon the matter, stated that a 440 i
' should be a race instead of a box- 1
| ing match. By "boxing match" he j
j hay have meant cither of two things.
The boxing commonly spoke of in
track is a perfectly lePal running
tactic, and a runner who finds him
self in a box has only himself to
blame.
It is unlikely that Cromwell re
j ferred in his statement to that type
I of boxing used in the ring, since his
runner, Vic Williams, was the only
I quarter-miler who employed any
thing suggesting pugilistic methods
in the Indian-Trojan 440 last Satur
day, which started all the contro
versy.

Objects to Lanes
In regard to a statement of Coach
! Dean Cromwell's that Trojan run
| ners would never meet Stanford in
a 440 again unless the race were run ,
1 in lanes, Templeton stated yesterday
j that he would certainly object to j
such a suggestion, should it arise at ,
(he California Intercollegiates in I
Los Angeles.
"A 440 run in lanes would be no
; race at all," said Templeton. "Points
! might just as well be given after a
I series of time trials." Th© lane sys- !
| tem would necessitate stepping the
j starting lines, so that the runners |
would not see their normal position j
i in the race until they reached the i
j final stretch.
