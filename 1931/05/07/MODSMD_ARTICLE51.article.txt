## Vincent Richards Will Defend World's Professional Title in New York Matches Saturday 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The former boy wonder of tennis,
Mr. Vincent Richards, who used to
aim tennis balls at the neighbors'
milk bottles and acquired such ac
curacy in so doing that he ultimate
ly became one of the few players
who could beat Bill Tilden with any
degree of regularity, will defend his
title as world's professional tennis
champion against the elongated
Philadelphian in a series of matches
which start in Madison Square Gar
den, New York, on Saturday, May 9.
As Mr. Richards beat Mr. Tilden
3 out of 5 matches in 1926, the last
time the boys met, and as Vinnie is
supposed to be playing much better
now than he did as an amateur and
as he is 8 or 9 years younger than
the Old Master, "Big Bill," you can
draw your own conclusions as to
who is going to win.
I like to think of him as "Rich
ards, the Conqueror," this veteran
Boy Wonder, who won the doubles
title of the United States when he
was 14 years old. Certainly he is
used to this "I came, I saw, I con
quered" stuff ("Vinnie, Vidi, Vici,'
eh?) He won every title in tennis
except the Wimbledon singles
! crown and the U.S. National Out
-1 door singles championship. (What's
that? The little boy in the back row
! wants to know when he won the
women's title?) And those who have
watched him in his matches with
Kozeluh in the professional tourna
ment claim that he could beat even
the great Cochet.
| To some, this idea of Jack Cur
i ley's of touring Tilden and Kozeluh
: around the country in a series of
professional matches, and then

! matching Richards with the winner,
1 may savor of the word "racket" in
' more ways than one. But don't kid
i yourself that Vinnie doesn't want to
i beat Tilden and vice versa. The only
love ever lost between these two
j is a love game or a love set!
