# WARNER DECREES SCRIMMAGES FOR SPRING WORKOUTS
## Shift Retention Is Feature Of Football Practice For New Season 
### Lowell Cox 
i If Stanford's football team doesn't j
function under fire next fall, it '
won't be because of lack of work,
j Where scrimmage was the excep- \
. tion last spring, it is the rule this j
year. "Pop" Warner is sending his !
I squad through stiff scrimmages at !
; nearly every practice, and three i
: sessions are held a week.
Perhaps the outstanding feature of I
practice so far this spring is the re- j
I tention of the shift, an innovation j
I which made its appearance on the !
| Farm in mid-rseason last year.
Shift Surprises
The Warner version of the shift, '
I which instead of being used on |
every play, is only a device for sur- j
prise and variety, proved particu- !
larly successful against Dartmouth j
j in the closing game last November. |
j It adds greatly to the versatility of !
j the "C" formation, being a shift from |
! "C" to "A."
Thus when the team lines up in j
j "C" with its balanced line, the op- f
i position is kept in doubt as to j
| whether a play will be run direct \
j from that formation or from the !
| regulation "A," with unbalanced ■
j line, after a shift.
j While the shift will not be basic,
I its reappearance this spring indi- j
I cates that it will undoubtedly be an !
I important factor in the Indian of
, fense.

With the close of baseball season,
| three gridders have returned to the
I fold, Rintala, Caddel, and Campbell, i
| Several others, however, are still !
I much occupied with track, in par- i
ticular George Grey, Nellie Gray, !
i and Here Laborde. The latter are '
; very much in demand, Dink Tem- j
1 pleton moaning for them in the fall !
| and "Pop" wanting them in the
j spring.
Little took place at practice last
night, the Convalescent Home oc
cupying the spotlight. Only a hand
| ful of players appeared in uniform,
the remainder wielding shovels and
hoes at the campus charity.

i If Stanford's football team doesn't j
function under fire next fall, it '
won't be because of lack of work,
j Where scrimmage was the excep- \
. tion last spring, it is the rule this j
year. "Pop" Warner is sending his !
I squad through stiff scrimmages at !
; nearly every practice, and three i
: sessions are held a week.
Perhaps the outstanding feature of I
practice so far this spring is the re- j
I tention of the shift, an innovation j
I which made its appearance on the !
| Farm in mid-rseason last year.
Shift Surprises
The Warner version of the shift, '
I which instead of being used on |
every play, is only a device for sur- j
prise and variety, proved particu- !
larly successful against Dartmouth j
j in the closing game last November. |
j It adds greatly to the versatility of !
j the "C" formation, being a shift from |
! "C" to "A."
Thus when the team lines up in j
j "C" with its balanced line, the op- f
i position is kept in doubt as to j
| whether a play will be run direct \
j from that formation or from the !
| regulation "A," with unbalanced ■
j line, after a shift.
j While the shift will not be basic,
I its reappearance this spring indi- j
I cates that it will undoubtedly be an !
I important factor in the Indian of
, fense.
Ball Players Show
With the close of baseball season,
| three gridders have returned to the
I fold, Rintala, Caddel, and Campbell, i
| Several others, however, are still !
I much occupied with track, in par- i
ticular George Grey, Nellie Gray, !
i and Here Laborde. The latter are '
; very much in demand, Dink Tem- j
1 pleton moaning for them in the fall !
| and "Pop" wanting them in the
j spring.
Little took place at practice last
night, the Convalescent Home oc
cupying the spotlight. Only a hand
| ful of players appeared in uniform,
the remainder wielding shovels and
hoes at the campus charity.
