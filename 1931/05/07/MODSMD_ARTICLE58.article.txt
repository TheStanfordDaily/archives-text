## 
### 
Coming as somewhat of a surprise,
the doubles handball team of Hein
ecke and Hocdel went down to de
feat yesterday at the hands of Stein
and Norris by scores of 21-G, and
21-12.

Heinecke and Hoedel had won all
of their previous games by large
scores and were expected to reach
the finals without much trouble. By
winning this match, Stein and Nor
ris will enter the final round and
meet Bradshaw and Reyburn for the
school championship next week.
The winners will be presented
with gold and also have their
names engraved on the Wiggins
trophy.
