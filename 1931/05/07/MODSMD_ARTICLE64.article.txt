# NO JAUNT TO JAPAN FOR HUSKY TRUANTS
## 
### 
SEATTLE, May 6. (/P)â€”Here is
the height of disappointment in the
estimation of Lemar Gaw and War
ren Brown, University of Washing
ton baseball players.
They stayed out of school two
years to be eligible to play on this
season's nine and make a trip to
Japan with the Huskies and then
the tour was called off on account
of finances.
