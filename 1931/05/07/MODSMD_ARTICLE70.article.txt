# REPORTS INDICATE RUSSIA WILL LEAD WHEAT PRODUCERS
## European State Surpasses Production Record Held Since 1913 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 6. </P)—Rus
sia again is the world's leading pro
ducer of wheat.
Figures supporting that unsus
pected and highly significant state
ment were expected today to be re
leased about May 20 by the United
States Department of Agriculture.
It was said that Russian produc
tion for 1930 likely would be an
nounced at 1,097,000.000 bushels,
which is 246,000,000 bushels more
than was produced by the United
States — wheat-growing champions
since Russia left the export picture
during the war.
That figure would show Russia
to have exceeded her greatest pro
duction mark since the days when
she dominated the world export
trade. That mark, established in
1913, credited Russia with a pro
duction of 1,028,000,000 bushels. It
was the first time Russia reached
the billion-bushel score.
The significance of the situation,
market experts said, was that it
might present to the International
Wheat Conference in London on
May 19 the question of re-allocating
world wheat areas.
