# GERMAN PLAY IS WELL RECEIVED
## Expert Direction Features "Dance Of Death” 
### 
"Ein Totentanz" the German Club
production presented in the Little
Theatre last night was lifted, mainly
by Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt's expert
direction, into the class of the in
tensely interesting.
The size of the enthusiastic audi
ence reminded one of the crowd that
filled the Little Theatre in the more
balmy days of the quarterly one
act presentations.
Modern Miracle
"Ein Totentanz" or the "Dance of
Death" is the modern version of a
medieval miracle play and contains
many obvious defects including
much repetition, sing-song meter,
and long soliloquies. Peter Vellenga
in his exotic role of Death triumphed
over these with his competent act
ing and strong voice. A good make
up and an almost too grotesque cos
tume heightened his effectiveness.
The lighting effects were the best
that have been seen on a Stanford
stage for a long while. The first
dialogue between Death and the
Lord was staged in darkness, except
for a light that illuminated the face
of Death and cast a shadow of his
scythe against the background.
Members of Cast
Henry Kleinback as the Herald
gave several clever touches to the
introduction and set the play off on
a high pitch, while Karl Falk did
two very good pieces of work as the
Beggar, and later as the Emperor.
The rest of the cast included Jane
Townley as a Mother; Joseph Ponti
as a Magistrate; Chris Carstenson,
as a Soldier; Louise Dohrmann as a
Tradeswoman; and Dorothy Uh'ici
as a Maiden.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 7. (IP)—
Seven-cent gasoline made its ap
pearance here today when a Mission
Street garage owner started selling
it at that price. This is the lowest
price at which gasoline has retailed
here in 20 years.
