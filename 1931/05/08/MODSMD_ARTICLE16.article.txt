# Indians Seek Troy's Scalp In Track Tilt At Fresno Saturday
## Templeton to Concentrate on 880, Mile Relays; May Enter Jones in High Barrier Event; Stanford To Try for World Relay Record 
### LOWELL COX 
OTILL smarting from last Saturday's unexpected lashing at the hands
of the Southern California Trojans, Stanford's Indians will make a
tremendous hid to win the West Coast Relays at Fresno tomorrow night.
With two other teams of at least equal strength entered, the task before
"Dink" Templeton and his proteges is no easy one. A three-corncrcd
battle between Stanford, Southern California, and the Los Angeles
Athletic Club is expected to make this year's relays the most thrilling
on record. A brilliant array of track and Held stars, the cream of the
coast, will provide many individual struggles which should rival the

• battle for team honors for interest.
No less than 1G champions will be
entered.
It is to two relay events and the
shuttle hurdles that Stanford is
I looking for most of the Indian points.
: Once again '"Blazing Ben" Eastman
will carry a big burden, being en
j tered in three events, while Hec
! Dyer, Les Hables, and Captain
"Podge" Smith will also be highly
i important factors.
Record May Fall
| Templeton is concentrating on two
relay events—the 880 and the mile.
; A world's record may fall in the
latter, when Shove, Les Hables, Ike
i Hables, and Eastman again vie with
I th?> Trojan quartet in the classic
struggle of the evening.
Les Hables, Lombardi, or Giber
son, Eastman and Dyer will be as
signed the half-mile relay which
1 they are expected to win, and the
1 440-yard event. A victory in the
latter is entirely possible, although
the Farm quartet will have to travel
to beat the Trojan sprinters.
Practice Looks Good
In practice yesterday Templeton's
j quartet reeled off the shorter run in
1 42.1 seconds in spite of one bad
baton pass, very fair time. Ten min
utes later, the interval scheduled
for the meet, they did the 880 in
1 1:28.1. Hables and Giberson took 45
1 seconds for the first lap, but the
tireless Eastman and Dyer traversed
I the second lap in 43.1 seconds.
Because of the short rest period,
it is possible that Giberson will run
,in one race and Lombardi in the
i other.
i
Jones in Hurdles
Another Stanford victory should
be forthcoming in the shuttle hur
dle race, with "Podge" Smith, Nis
: bet, Brugman, and Gordon or Bob
Jones entered. Jones took time out
; from his discus duties yesterday to
work out over the high barriers,
and may compete in place of Gor-
I don.
As for the other relay events:
Dean Cromwell's splendid array of
half-milers will probably cop the
two-mile relay, since Ben Eastman
I has too many other chores to per
! form to be able to enter. Stanford
i will be represented by Brown,
! Wright, Fullenwider, and Cooper or
I Sam Eastman.
I The medley relay, consisting of
i two quarter-mile laps, an 880, and
! a mile, may also go to the Trojans.
| Templeton will probably enter
Shove, Ike Hables, Brown, and
Wright. Howell and Sam Eastman
might get into the event.
Sprints Have Stars
Only two individual track events
are scheduled, the 100-yard dash
and the 120-yard high hurdles. The
former will be one of the closest
1 battles of the meet, with Hec Dyer
and Frank Wykoff meeting again,
and Cy Leland, Les Hables, Sparks,
Robinson, and other crack sprinters
also entered. Wykoff is favored to
win, but with a good start Dyer has
an excellent chance to repeat his
win of the U.S.C. meet last year.
The hurdle event finds Smith and
Nesbit of Stanford facing tough
competition in Berry and Stokes of
U.S.C. and Maxwell of the Los An
geles Athletic Club.
A galaxy of champions will com
pete in the field events. Brix of
L.A.A.C. and Krenz of the Olympic
Club will duel in shot put and dis
cus, with the Indians in line for a
third in the former by Nellie Gray
j and a third in the latter by Jones.
Barnes in Vault
Barnes, world record-holder in
the pole vault, should win that event
easily for L.A.A.C., with DeGroot,
Pool, Barber, and Chlentzos fighting
for the other places.
A few other Stanford points may
be forthcoming from the broad
jump, high jump, and javelin, al
though the competition in each will
be tough.
Since the relays are scored twice
as heavily as the field events, the
former will probably decide the
meet.
Stanford's hopes for a world rec
ord in the mile relay are hampered
somewhat by the fact that only 10
minutes separates that event from
the 880. but with the Trojans pound
ing at their heels, the Cardinal
I quartet may deliver.
