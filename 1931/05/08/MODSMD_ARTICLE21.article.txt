i read: ". . . . and one freshman to be
i elected at the spring elections for
: the following year."
A change to remove a technical j
| difficulty in the constitution is also
' proposed. The Ex Committee recom
, mends that in ease of the absence of ;
, the Dean of the Law School to in
i terpret the constitution, the faculty j
| member acting as temporary Dean j
1 handle such matters. The phrase :

) An amendment to make it pos
: sible for students to change the
; A.S.S.U. by-laws by popular elec
tion, providing a petition of 50
i names requesting a change is made,

; amendment to Article XI is as fol-
I lows: ". . . . said petition to con
j tain 50 signatures. The vote may be
taken at either a regular or special
