The disillusioned students of U.C.L.A. and Ohio State
I'Diversity have kicked in the sides of the good old war
drum, one group by circulating petitions demanding the
abolition of compulsory military training, and the other
group by announcing a "walkout" in protest against the
same thing.
The anti-militarists may take the opportunity to make
much of these petitions and walkouts but, l'ranklv, there
doesn't seem to be as much in it as would appear from a
surface glance. It is a ten to one shot that the movements
originated in a profound dislike for the task of lugging
around a rifle or currying a horse on a warm spring after
noon, and not in any concerted drive to keep the world safe
for pacifism.
Once again The Daily announces its supreme indiffer
ence to the throbbing question of militarism versus paci
fism, with this single reservation. The Daily is unalterably
opposed to compulsory military training, and heartily in
favor of the system in vogue at Stanford, whereby such
courses are optional. That makes it a fair field and no
favor—R.O.T.C. for the militarists and P.E. 1 for the paci
fists'.
