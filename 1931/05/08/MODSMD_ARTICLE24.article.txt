# THE
						RESERVED BOOK ROOM
## 
### 
When Stanford students returned to the campus after
the spring recess, they found a new system installed in the
Library's reserved hook room. All the hooks on reserve
were to he found in this downstairs room, and relief was
promised from the annoyance of having to go to the loan
desk for some hooks and downstairs for others on reserve.

Hut after a month of trial, the new system lias not given
tlie better service expected of it. The counter in the re-,
modeled reserve hook room is altogether too small to take
eare of the students who ask for hooks during the rush
periods. The counter is crowded into a corner near the
door making it even more a center of confusion during the
busy hours. The quick and efficient service to be expected
under an arrangement centralizing the lending of reserve
books has not materialized. When a student has a free
hour to devote to reading, he finds a quarter of it gone
before he can secure his book.

And all Ibis confusion at the head of the room spreads
noise throughout the entire room, making it difficult and
disturbing for those who have succeeded in obtaining their
books. The reserved book room is altogether too.noisy for
study, but students are expected to study there.

Now this situation is unnecessary. It should be changed.
A preliminary step would he the installation of a longer
and more adequate counter at the head of the room. Pos
sibly more books can be put on the shelves around the
room. When this is done* perhaps it will be found that
there are enough attendants behind the counter; if not,
more should be added.
