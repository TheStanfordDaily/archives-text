# EDUCATION'S AFTERMATH
## 
### 
What after collect 1 ? Probably the greatest problem that
seniors face, unless they enter a graduate school for special
training, is that which concerns their futures. Throughout
the country, colleges realize that no longer do men and
women come to them with careers planned. College is an
end in itself until it is over.
Saturday morning, three women, outstanding in their
professions, are coming lo the campus to talk on their work
to all Stanford women interested. Many of the latter are
in a quandry about their futures. Here is their chance to
get first-hand information about three fields: medicine,
writing, and teaching. Another and more constant source
of information is the library in the vocational guidance
office of Gilbert Wrcnrt, for the use of the student body at
large.
Stops are being taken to give students with their "cul
tural backgrounds" all the assistance possible in making a
wise choice of career. Thev should avail themselves of
these opportunities.
