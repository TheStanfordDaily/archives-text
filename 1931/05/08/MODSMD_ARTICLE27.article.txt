I THE POLITICAL PROBLEM
(Pciui State Collegian)
An ideal situation in politics would
exist if each voter, qualiiied with
average mentality and moderately
educated as to the ability of the
candidates for office, would cast his
vote for the nominee he honestly
considered best fitted for the office.
That the voters of Penn State,
singly and in groups, are swayed
from voting an "honest opinion"'
ballot by rash promises from office
seekers has been a recognized fact
for some years. To combat such an
unsavory condition last year, Stu
dent Council instigated open politics,
recognizing cliques but requiring
them to reveal a list of members,
and limiting the organizations to a
' small amount of money for ex
penses.

It has become more apparent than
ever this year that the so-called
"clique-recognition" has done little
to correct political evils, but rather
has brought lobbying from a secret
hiding place and firmly intrenched
lit on the street corner or in the halls
of Old Main. The continual crowd in
the vicinity of ballot boxes in Old
Main lobby, although suggestive of
state conventions, was certainly not
conducive to independent voting.

It would be useless to say that
fraternity cliques should be abol
ished. They would crop up again
under a veil oi' secrecy, just as they
did in the past. It is also evident
that where cliques must exist, an
"open" system of politics is more
desirable. But certain restrictions
placed upon the cliques by Council
have obviously been violated by
many of the organizations.

For instance, it is a violation of
the election code for cliques to back
Student Council nominees. Yet,
cliques nominate these candidates,
and delegates instruct their respec
tive fraternities to back the choice
of the clique. Another violation of
the code occurred when several fra
ternities switched clique affiliations
after the list had been turned in to
the elections committee.

As far as actual voting was con
cerned, the ballot boxes were super
vised efficiently and the voters were
checked by the committee in a
thorough and satisfactory manner.
The committee was powerless to
control some of the discrepancies
which took place during the 1931
elections, but with another year
many faults in the code might be
ironed out by careful legislation and
strict enforcement of the election
laws.
