At last we have a definition of
tragedy, as exemplified by a Stan
ford rough. Who says that sadness
never enters the life of a eollitch
man?
If any of you happened to he
around, night before last, you
heard (he crash of the elements,
as the Fijis and Gamma Phis
wrecked a couple of cars and in
cidentally a mail box on the
street corner.
Much gore, and cries for help.
And then, an ATO, "Oh my
God I just mailed a letter
there!"
Can anyone here present think of
a really plausible reason why we
shouldn't have a swimming pool
where all of us, both men and wom
en, could go swimming together?
With so many pools on the campus,
it seems to be an oversight not to
have something of the sort. And if
it's never going to rain anymore,
and we're never going to have the
lake again, even for a few months
at a time, something ought to be
done.
There's the good old question
again, Mr. President. Wouldn't
you rather have your children
safely under the influence of
aqua pura, than aqua velva on
a park bench?
And another thing is the way poli
ties on this place are going to seed.
It's really OK, supposedly, the way
things are run, only why don't we
get some sort of a new angle on
the problem? Stanford might as well
be a school for 50 instead of seven
times that many people, as far as
doing things is concerned.
Localized politics are lttalc
factory influence in a small com
munity (quotation) and wc
never liked Spanish food any
way (food from a male-factoryâ€”
get it?).
And another one, filched from the
notebook of a budding Washington
genius:
"Have you heard the street car
conductor's song?"
"No. Something dirty, is it?"
"Uh-uh. 'You're the one I car
fare; "
