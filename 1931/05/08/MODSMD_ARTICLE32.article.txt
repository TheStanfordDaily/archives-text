# MORE ABOUT GRADING

The Editor, Sir:
I should like to present a case
concerning examinations which has
always puzzled me. It is especially
true of courses in letters and the
social sciences.
For purposes of illustration let us
suppose that Jones and I take a his
tory examination in which one of
the questions is: "Outline the spread
i of socialism in Siberia." We write
practically the same answer, but I
I write a larger hand, so I stretch my
; bluff into five pages while he strug
i gles over three. In a week or so we
receive our blue books and discover
j that I have made exactly two and
seven-eighths of a per cent higher
| lhan he did on that particular ques-
I tion. Since we scored the same on
the rest of the examination, I get a
|B minus, while poor Jones must be
; content with the "gentleman's
| grade" of C plus.
In the first place I cannot see how
a general question can be analyzed
so mathematically. However, my
main point is that a number of such
meticulous differences can make
quite a difference in a Bawlout aver
age.
Obviously I have exaggerated, yet
many of you have been witnesses
I or victims in similar cases. We must
j admit that there could be a better
system. And one suggested change
i appeals to me so much that I take
the liberty of passing it on.
7'his suggestion was, that there be
I three grades only, a plus, indicating
i passing work; a minus, or flunk; and
an A given for exceptional work
only. Naturally a very large per
| centage of each class would receive
pluses, and perhaps in particular
classes there would be no other
grade. But there would still be the
minus to check up on the slacker,
and an A for the student who wished
to distinguish himself.
Although this idea is not at all
! original with me, I did think it
i worthy of mention.
