# BULL SESSION
## SOCIOLOGY IS NOT MATHEMATICS 
### 
Herbert Hoover entered the White j
House determined, it seems, to use j
the scientific method. His first plan
was to get the facts. When building
bridges or working mines, the en- :
gineer sets out, one imagines, and ,
finds all data; and from
this data builds his project. Such a
plan is not possible in dealing with |
social and political questions.
No one has any preconceived no- !
tions or fundamental methods of i
thinking that warp his slant on fig
ures when dealing with an igert j
subject like a highway. However, j
when we come to a subject like j
prohibition, the opposite is true. :
Give a wet and a dry the same set I
of statistics, and each one can draw •
different conclusions. If the fads
were to show great quantities of (
liquor were coming across the bor- !
der, the dry would say, "More cn- j
forcement"; the wet's answer to the !
same facts would be, "Prohibition I
is a failure; let us abolish it."
The Wickersham Commission is an i
excellent answer to the demand for :
"scientific methods" in social ques- !
tions. This worthy body spent much i
time in collecting data and studying !
the question at hand; and yet so in- !
conclusive has been its report that
the nation is still trying to figure out !
what is to be done. The body was
supposed to be impartial because it
contained wets and drys. Because

! the body contained so many shades
J of opinion, it is no wonder that their
! report was so involved and contra
| dictory.
j The President was no doubt trying
! to be fair to all groups in making
; up this Commission. As a result, he
and Congress are faced with such a
! host of opinions that if any genuine
| change one way or the other comes
: from the lengthy report, it will only
| be by the grace of God and the
i pressure on the party to do some
thing before the election of 1932.
Hoover no doubt had his own
| opinion about whether liquor should
|be sold in America legally before
' the commission was formed. It
I seems that although he has been
J saved two years of worrying over
I (he question by the appointment of
11 he commission, he is now faced by
1 a more serious problem than if he
, had attempted to settle the question
' back in 1928. Everybody gives ad
: vice to the President; and of course
j none of it has any effect. It does
j seem to us, however, that if he had
! chosen a body of statisticians to
j bring the facts to him without con
| elusions attached, the whole issue
; would be clearer cut. The? Commis
-1 sion can hedge and clutter its report
with conflicting opinions and no
| body cares materially. The Presi
dent, however, cannot compromise.
The nation is waiting for his deci
sion. —Abe Mellinkofi'
