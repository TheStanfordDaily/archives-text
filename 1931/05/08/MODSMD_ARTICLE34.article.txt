HERE'S LUCK—By Stephen French
Whitman. D. Appleton and Com
pany. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
"Here's Luck" is another book
about gang warfare, but not "just
another one." The author has woven
a real condemnation of prohibition
and its growing evils into the story
of Nick Sassoti, master hoodlum,
and his charming sister Lucrezia
leading their gang through war af
ter bloody war to complete political
control of their section of Chicago.
Lucrezia falls in love with and
captures a pleasant gentleman from
the other and distinctly more re
spectable side of town. With com
mendable aplomb he takes part in
all the activities of the gang, coming
off with a minimum of bullet holes,
the worst being inflicted by his be
loved "Lu."
In a passage describing one of the
tougher gorillas of Nick's trusty
crew the author says, "With his sol
emn horse-face and striped tie he
might have been a college senior."
Perhaps the author went to collegc
too.
But whether he did or not he has
written an interesting and arresting
book. —S.C.A.

PORNOGRAPHY AND OBSCEN
ITY—By D. If. Lawrcncc. Alfred
Knopf. 1930.
D.H., who should know about his |
subject having been maligned re- j
lentlessly by the combined censors j
of the more civilized nations of the !
world, here presents a paper of j
some interest. After demonstrating j

| the existence of a double standard
of definitions: one for many, one for
the individual, he protests lustily
against rule of the mob.
False purity he would abolish.
| Rather than keep a secret system
| atically insulted by Puritans and
■' postcard salesmen, he would make
! sex open and frank. The plea is in
j teresting as authored by cne read
' covertly and banned religiously by
| comstockians protecting the citi
(zenry from immoral influences in
j literature, and delegating to W.
; Hays and W. Hearst, respectively,
I the preservation of purity in movies
I and press.

Lawrence's argument is repre
sentative of the struggle by toler
ant, sane humans against a situa
tion which has proved itself dis
couragingly silly. —J.S.S.
