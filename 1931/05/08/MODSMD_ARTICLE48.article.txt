WASHINGTON, May 7. lA')-Re
scntment against war debts owed
the United States and this country's
tariff policies flared forth in sharp
speeches today before the Interna
tional Chamber of Commerce.
Dr. Carl Bergmann, former Ger
man secretary of state for finance,
emphasized the importance of repa
rations and debts settlements on the
international economic structure and
described them as having been
linked together to all intents and
purposes.
He called upon the international
chamber to foster with all its power
the reconsideration of the settle
ments.
Briton Applauded
An attack on the American tariff
by Henry Bell, an English banker,
was applauded at length. He eon
tended this country had failed to
appreciate the duties incumbent
upon it in its new position as a
creditor nation, concluding "we ask
them to rise to the responsibility of
their great position."
"It is an attitude of one part of
the world, if not of more, to be most
anxious to sell its goods, but to be
very careful that it should not buy
anybodys' else goods in exchange,"
he said. "What is hurting the world
mostly today is, I think, a miscon
ception on the part of the great
nation whose guests we are. They
are magnificent hosts, but they are
awfully poor customers."
Germany Objects
Dr. Bergmann said he had been
advised that the debts question was
"a matter which had better not be
brought up before this conference,
because it is of the highest political
importance."
Plunging into the subject regard
less, he said: "Under the Young
Plan, Germany has to pay her sev
eral creditors what they owe to the
United States, so that the full bur
den of the international debts falls
upon Germany."
