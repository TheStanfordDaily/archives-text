With more than 20 local fencers i
competing, two major tournaments !
are scheduled for next week in the j
boxing gallery of Encina gym.
On Tuesday afternoon at 4:15 j
o'clock the first annual epee meet j
will be held. Leonard Pockman, cap- j
tain-elect, who in 1928 was Pacific !
Coast novice champion, is expected j
to win the event. In the following !
season he was a member of the Los ;
Angeles Athletic Club championship ,
squad. While at the southern club
Pockman defeated a member of the '
1928 Olympic Games squad in the !
epee event.
James Reed, a two-year varsity .
veteran, should furnish strong com
petition in the meet as he also has ;
had considerable experience â€¢ with |
the duelling sword. Others in ihe !
competition include John Ferguson, !
Larry Higgins, Fred Pearman, Rich
ard Criley, and Ed Munger.
The other event slated for next !
week is the first saber champion
ships held here. The three-man
varsity squad that has not been de- j
featcd this year in intercollegiate i
competition will fight it out among ;
themselves for first place.
The team is made up of Leonard
Pockman, James Reed, and Tom i
Pockman. Leonard Pockman stands i
the best chance to win in this match
as well as in the epee.
