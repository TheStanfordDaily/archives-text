# ROOMY BORROWS NON STEALABLE SQUAWKING AUTO
##

lIE had borrowed his room
mate's car and was heading
for Palo Alto. Suddenly the
raucous squawk of a motor
horn rent the air, followed by
a series of similar noises from
the same source.
"What the heck!" remarked
the usurping driver, pulling at
levers, feeling about with his
heels, slapping the cushions,
kicking the clutch in and out
with little avail, as the horn
continued to bray with inter
mittent vigor.
By this time the staid little
village had been reached, and
the angry cries of the car, shat
tering the satisfied quiet,
threatened to create such a dis
turbance that the driver scut
tled back to the campus.
'â€¢What the
the driver queried the owner,
when he could be found.
"Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That's a secret burglar alarm."
At a late hour last night, the
patient was reported pro
gressing as satisfactorily as
could be expected under the
circumstances.
