Kathleen Norris was the guest
i speaker at the meeting of the Stan
! ford Dames held in the Women's
i Clubhouse yesterday afternoon. Her
! topic was "The New Problems of
j Women," in which she contrasted
i the present generation with the pre
! ceeding one, and emphasized the
I differences in the difficulties with
; which each generation has had to
i cope.
"One of the most important causes
j of the present economic depression,"
stated Mrs. Norris, "I believe to be
; due to the fact that too many people
have been living beyond their
means. The big problem facing the
present generation is to learn not to
spend in excess of what they actu
ally have."
