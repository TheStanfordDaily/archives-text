# FRATERNITY MEN PURSUE RODENTS WITH 5 FT. SNAKE
## 
### 
ARIENTAL fakir shows, fea
turing mortal combats be
tween the wily mongoose and
the deadly cobra, have been
given their parallel on the
Stanford campus.
As a result, fraternity men
spent the afternoon crawling
around one lawn, ears pressed
to the ground, to detect any
sounds of battle, gnawing of
prey, of audible portents of do
mestic felicity from below.
The house, having recently
planted a new patch of lawn,
found itself troubled with a
family of moles, which wrought
zigzag mounds and tunnels
throughout the nascent green
sward. Meeting with little suc
cess in the use of various traps
to exterminate the creatures,
some of the brothers succeeded
in capturing a five-foot garter
snake for the purpose.
The snake was persuaded to
glide into the moles' tunnel. As
we go to press, neither snake
nor mole has reappeared, after
some ten hours underground.
