Another Change
A change to remove a technical

! difficulty in the constitution is also [
proposed. The Ex Committee recom
mends that in case of the absence of
the Dean of the Law School to in
, terpret the constitution, the faculty i
member acting as temporary Dean
handle such matters. The phrase j
; proposed to cover this matter in ,
Article 12 is as follows: ... or i
in case of absence, by the member j
of the faculty acting as temporary |
! Dean."
A move to shift the nomination j
days to Tuesday and Wednesday in- j
stead of Wednesday and Thursday j
as it now is, has been proposed by |
the Ex Committee. The proposed
amendment to Article 9, Section 3, is |
• as follows: "Nominations for each j
election shall be opened on the j
Tuesday preceding elections, and be |
closed on the evening of the fol- j
i lowing day. Should special circum- !
stances demand that the election not j
1 be held on a Tuesday, the Executive j
i nations two consecutive days begin- i
• | Comittee may designate for nomi- |
ning not more than a week and not !
' j less than four days before the elec- !
' I tion."
Amendment
An amendment to make it pos- |
. sible for students to change the J
• A.S.S.U. by-laws by popular elec- !
• tion, providing a petition of 50
names requesting a change is made, |
i has been proposed. As the constitu- |
■tion now stands it would require a j
mass meeting of 500 students to ]
• make changes in the by-laws. The
) amendment to Article XI is as fol-
I lows: . said petition to con
■ tain 50 signatures. The vote may be
• taken at either a regular or special
election of the Association, a ma
jority vote being necessary for ap-
II proval of the proposed change." i

Amendments
Four amendments to the A.S.S.U.
constitution recommended by the
Ex Committee will appear on the
ballots for student vote:
A change in the constitution to
give the sophomore class repre
sentation on the Ex Committee dur
ing the first half of the academic
year is proposed, the amendment to
Article 3, Section 1, Part (b) will
read: . and one freshman to be
elected at the spring elections for
the following year."
Another Change
A change to remove a technical

! difficulty in the constitution is also [
proposed. The Ex Committee recom
mends that in case of the absence of
the Dean of the Law School to in
, terpret the constitution, the faculty i
member acting as temporary Dean
handle such matters. The phrase j
; proposed to cover this matter in ,
Article 12 is as follows: ... or i
in case of absence, by the member j
of the faculty acting as temporary |
! Dean."
A move to shift the nomination j
days to Tuesday and Wednesday in- j
stead of Wednesday and Thursday j
as it now is, has been proposed by |
the Ex Committee. The proposed
amendment to Article 9, Section 3, is |
• as follows: "Nominations for each j
election shall be opened on the j
Tuesday preceding elections, and be |
closed on the evening of the fol- j
i lowing day. Should special circum- !
stances demand that the election not j
1 be held on a Tuesday, the Executive j
i nations two consecutive days begin- i
• | Comittee may designate for nomi- |
ning not more than a week and not !
' j less than four days before the elec- !
' I tion."
Amendment
An amendment to make it pos- |
. sible for students to change the J
• A.S.S.U. by-laws by popular elec- !
• tion, providing a petition of 50
names requesting a change is made, |
i has been proposed. As the constitu- |
■tion now stands it would require a j
mass meeting of 500 students to ]
• make changes in the by-laws. The
) amendment to Article XI is as fol-
I lows: . said petition to con
■ tain 50 signatures. The vote may be
• taken at either a regular or special
election of the Association, a ma
jority vote being necessary for ap-
II proval of the proposed change." i
