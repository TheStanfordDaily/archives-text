WASHINGTON, May 10. (A>)
While American delegates to the
International Chamber of Commerce
meeting were claiming victory today
on the war debts and tariff issues
which stirred last week's sessions,
Republican members of Congress re
plied to British and German attacks
on the domestic tariff.
Senator Hatfield, West Virginia,
and Representative Ranseyer, lowa,
both Republicans, saw in the for
eign criticisms an effort lo lower
American standards of living to the
level of Europe by throwing open
the domestic market to low produc
tion cost goods for the "enrichment"
of outsider*.
