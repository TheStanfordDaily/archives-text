# U.S. GIRL WINS OUTBOARD RACE
## Italian Fascist Cup Goes To Monrovia Girl 
### 
GARLONE, Riviera, Italy, May 10
(/P). â€”Loretta Turnbull, 18-year-old
youngster from Monrovia, Califor
nia, today captured the Fascist par
ty's "PNF" cup in the international
speed boat meet organized by the
poet Cabrielle d'Annunzio.

The California girl came from be
hind after apparently being out of
the race and in dashing style pushed
her outboard motor boat, "Sunkissed
Kid," from a trailing position into
second place. In another circuit she
would have passed the finish line
first. As it turned out, her average
time for today and yesterday, when
she won the first heat of the "PNF"
competition, gave her the trophy.

Miss Turnbull ran into trouble
soon after the start of today's heat.
The motor of her boat sputtered
freely and her six rivals flew past.
The crowd thought her chance had
gone, but she tinkered with the en-

gine and in a minute was on her
way again. She crept past one rival
after another, as the crowd cheered,
and she was scarcely half a minute
behind at the finish.
