# BUCHAREST STAGES PARADE FOR CAROL
## 
### 
BUCHAREST, Rumania, May 10.
I (/!')â€”A great military parade was
I held in Bucharest today in the pres
; ence of King Carol, who took the
salute alone. Queen Helen, who re
turned home today in a gay mood,
i was not present, as had been antici
pated.
Absence of the Queen caused
1 great lisappointment to those who
believe that at his recent meeting
[with Carol, King Alexander of Jugo
slavia had brought about a recon
ciliation between the estranged
royal couple.
Lawrence Arch of New York
killed himself and left more than
| $1,500,000 in insurance policies.
