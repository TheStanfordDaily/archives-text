I Ike Hables and Bill McGeagh of
Troy started lap two, a yard apart.
Ike was three yards ahead when
he gave the baton to his brother,
Les, who ran the prettiest lap of his

second-best 440 man, in the dust and
give Ben Eastman an eight-yard
lead over Vic Williams, S.C.'s A.A.U.
champ.

That final lap decided once and

man-Williams 440" controversy, for
Ben increased his lead steadily over
the Trojan until he reached the tape

Shove Leads Off
Shove toed the mark against Ger

I Ike Hables and Bill McGeagh of
Troy started lap two, a yard apart.
Ike was three yards ahead when
he gave the baton to his brother,
Les, who ran the prettiest lap of his
life to leave A1 Woessner, Troy's
second-best 440 man, in the dust and
give Ben Eastman an eight-yard
lead over Vic Williams, S.C.'s A.A.U.
champ.
Rig Ben Looms
That final lap decided once and
for all the "who would win an East
man-Williams 440" controversy, for
Ben increased his lead steadily over
the Trojan until he reached the tape
I fully 14 yards to the good. East
j man's time was 47.2.

his relay team just before the final
