"Moussorgsky's music is propa
i ganda that, uttered in words, would
j have landed the composer in pris
j on," said Warren D. Allen, Univer
sity organist, after his recital in the
' Memorial Church yesterday at
which he played Moussorgsky's
! "Pictures from an Exhibition."
"Moussorgsky wrote his 'Pictures'
! about the time of our Civil War.
[ They were inspired by some pic
! tures by V. Hartmann, the noted
[ Russian architect. His music was
radical because it was realistic when
| romantics like Chopin and Schu
mann were writing," Allen said.
"Moussorgsky had such a unique
conception of musical expression for
his period that until recently he has
scarcely been known. He is now
I considered by the Russians to be
! their greatest classical composer,
i During the Soviet regime Moussorg
sky's famous national music drama,
the opera "Boris Godounov," has
been revived from the original
script. This opera, which was con-
I siderably expurgated by the former
j government on account of its anti-
Vtsarist tendency, is now being given ,

recognition in proportion by the
Communists.

poverty, Moussorgsky turned to the

to express his thoughts. With this
intangible means he could give venl
to both his social and his artistic
theories. He was an ardent cham
pion of the oppressed. Being a real
ist he believed that music should bt
brought into closer relationship with
life, and opposed the doctrine ol
"art for art's sake" for its artificial
ity. As a composer he was voca
rather than symphonic."
"Samuel Goldenberg und Schmuy
lc," one of the "Pictures," is a study
of a rich, disdainful Jew and another
who was poor and miserable. Int<
this composition Moussorgsky wrote
his hatred of the proud and arro
gant and his sympathy for the
wretched. "The music changes from
cold, shrill notes of disdain to the
tremendous emotional feeling of the
beggar's timorous pleading," con
cluded Allen.
The organist expects to give c
repetition of the "Pictures from an
Exhibition" in the near future.
