For a month now the Argonaut, San Francisco weekly
magazine, has been publishing a series of articles on Stan
ford I'niversily. Articles 1. 11, 111, and IV have already
appeared. The Argonaut is saddened because Stanford is
no longer "true to the inspiration and the ideal for which
it was created." And the Argonaut is worried because
"there has been a steadily mounting chorus of challenge
to the spurious Stanford that now is."
So it is that in Article I the Argonaut, published by Wil
liam Wallace Chapin, asks the question: "If the new poli
cies, if the new leaders, if the new spirit of Stanford is an
improvement on the old, why then comes it about that
slowly but surely from every quarter of this country rises
an increasing volume of protest?"
In Article 111 the Argonaut answers its own question, de
claring: "It follows . . . that, even it' his | Dr. Wilbur's]
career as secretary were regarded as distinguished, since
the most violently pugnacious currents in American poli
tics swirl about the Interior, there would be a considerable
element of thinking Americans who would resent his ac
tions and who might conceivably maintain their resentment
against him in his new post fas president of Stanford |."
There lies the explanation of the Argonaut's sudden in
terest in Stanford, of ils seeming concern at the "meta
morphosis in this grand old institution." Politics is the
answer. The Argonaut, whose columns have not been char
acterized by an over-display of friendliness for the Hoover
administration, has sought to get at the latter by moaning
about Stanford.
