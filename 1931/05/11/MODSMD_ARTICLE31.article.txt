Major General Smedley I). Butler, speech-making ma
rine officer, revealed himself in a new role last week, that
of spy. It was at a banquet in Philadelphia that the general
told the assembled multitudes he had once been a spy, and
a successful one. He was explaining how he had won his
first Congressional Medal of Honor.

Butler told of being sent to Mexico City in 191 1, of
posing as an eccentric entomologist, a capitalist, and au
thor, of finally gaining an audience with President lluerta
while the latter was intoxicated, and of securing from him
a permit to enter all the garrisons of the city.

Once again, as is customary after a Butler address, ofli
cial circles in Washington buzzed with rumors of the dread
results that might follow the fighting marine's assertion
that a President of Mexico had been so drunk he had given
the keys of the city's defenses to a spy. Butler has been
doing a lot of talking for a good many years, and on occa
sion the State Department has been embarrassed. Not long
ago it had to apologize officially to Italy because the gen
eral had "insulted" Mussolini. So the State Department
was worried when he told of a drunken Mexican president.
But they put on a bold front and finally decided, since
the references were mainly of a personal nature, an official
protest from the Mexican government was not apt to be
forthcoming.

General Butler frequently has spoken out of turn. Often
he lias embarrassed his own and foreign governments; at
least he lias disturbed their dignity. But the American
people have him to thank for livening up the news at regu
lar intervals and breaking the monotony of (Mara Bow
scandals and noose murders with some "true" stories con
cerning the exploits of Smedley I). Butler, l .S. Marines.
And they're good stories.
