Another track and Meld classic is history, and Stanford
lms again lost to I'.S.C. But Dink Templeton's men re
turned to the campus yesterday the possessors of a world's
record, in the one-mile four-man relay. Last year a Stan
ford quartet carried the baton four times around a Los
Angeles track to set a new American record in this event.
On May 2 of this year another Stanford quartet, made up
of the two Hables brothers, Mavnor Shove, and Ben Kast
man, bettered this mark. And then last Saturday these
same four men ran faster still, faster than any four-man
mile relay team had ever run before.
Their achievement should long stand as a credit to
Stanford athletics.
