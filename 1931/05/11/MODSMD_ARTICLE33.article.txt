# The 						REVIEWER

### 
The past several years have seen
a number of plays and books based
on the romance of Queen Elizabeth
and the Earl of Essex, but the pres
ent play by Maxwell Anderson is
the first which attempts to tell the
story as it really happenecf.
"Elizabeth the Queen," written
partly in blank verse and partly in
prose, was first presented by the
Theatre Guild of New York, where
the play ran for a year. In its pro
duction there a large revolving
stage was used to shift scenes. This
method will be used for the first
time on the coast when the play
opens tonight.
QUICK MILLIONS—At the Varsity
Theatre.
Publicity on the latest at the Var
sity calls it a "racketeer romance."
There is very little romance in the
plot; the action centers almost en
tirely around one man.
Spencer Tracy is the truck driver,
too lazy to work and too smart to
steal, who organizes a truck drivers
combination and then pushes on to
still larger and more lucrative fields
of racketeering. You know all the
time that he will get his .sooner or
later, and- there is no disappoint
ment.

I As just another picture ridiculing
I gangsterism, with all the attendant
I noises, incoherent photography, and
i short scenes, it falls below the aver
age picture of this type.
The Conklin comedy is better than
j the usual Conklin slapstick, but
hints slightly of plagarism of Laurel
and Hardy. The Talkitoon is ex
cellent. —H.M.
LADIES' MAN—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Score one more hit for William
Powell. Every time he becomes more
1 polished and suave, and besides his
| very finished manner, he has a
I beautiful voice and ability as an
| actor.
"Ladies' Man" was a Rupert
Hughes best-seller. The film version
is even better. The story was not
j changed in the slightest detail, but
j the actors have revived and im
proved it. As in all Powell's pictures,
• the ending is tragic, but somehow
; while more tears may flow, the
result is a superior film.
The supporting cast is well chosen
and talented. Kay Francis is The
i Girl, and Carol Lombard is very
| pretty as the blonde exponent of
! flaming youth. The Francis-Powell
I combination is excellent, as always.


Pauline Frederick is shown here with lan Keith, in a scene from
"Elizabeth the Queen," which opens at the Curran Theatre in San Fran
cisco tonight. Miss Frederick plays the part of the virgin queen, with
Keith as Lord Essex, her favorite lover.
