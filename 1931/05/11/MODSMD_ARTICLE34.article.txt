It is estimated that the dials on
some 1,210 radios on the campus
were whirled through approximate
ly 7,728,000 complete revolutions on
Saturday night as the owners tried
frantically to get that pesky Fresno
broadcast, if there was one. Was
there? We don't know yet.

We do know, however, that
the nice little quarter-miler from
down U.S.C. way, who goes
around putting his hand on op
ponents' shoulders to keep from
spiking them, never got close
enough to Benjamin "Bang
Bang" Eastman to try it on Sat
urday, so Stanford set a world's
record in the mile relay.
So much for cutting in on the
sports editor's field. Tomorrow the
student body will turn out en masse
to elect officers (and echo answers,
"Oh, yeah?"). If you think that the
Football Gaieties are funny, you
I should go to an all-hall caucus
sometime.
Along about July, maybe, some
one else besides Stanford students
will get wise to the fact that there
are now traffic lights at the inter
section of Palm Drive and the high
way. The way the highway drivers
! come booming through against the
signal is giving a lot of the boys
around here gray hair. Lights or no
lights, the Stanford drivers look
carefully up and down before
crossing.
From our special operative
No. Q-22 comes word that a
dastardly plot to ruin the Uni
versity's fuir name has gone hay
wire. It seems a hunch of those
there hardy Engineers had
planned to appear on Quad to
day clad in those English shorts,
a la Troop l(i. Boy Scouts of
America. As we go to press,
however, reason had prevailed,
and trousers will still he the
outstanding feature of the En
gineers' apparel this spring.
