# CAMPUS OPINION
## BETTER TO TRAIN NOW 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is about time that the military
minds on this campus organize and
unite like the Women's Peace
League and the Hearst Trust and
| settle this hanging question of pacitl
l cism for once and for all.
The local military officers can't
' say a word because they fear an act
] of Congress might strike them dead.
The student officers hold back be
; cause they want to keep in good
! standing with the officers. Their
I fear is the fear of low grades.
We have had wars since Cain wore
; short pants, and we will always have
wars until the sociologists can abol
ish greed and jealousy. It is better
; to train now than to train after war
i is declared. Who ever heard of any
j body picking on a boxer?
When a dog shows his teeth in
Palo Alto, the Women's Peace
League calls the police. When there
I is war they are the first to cry for
protection and victory, and yet they
i want to destroy that protection.
We don't want military training
; to stai't wars, we want military
| training, to stop wars.
I Give me trench mouth in its worst
stages rather than a Peace League
card hanging in the window and a
1 foreign officer knocking on the front
door. â€”Adolph Muller, '32.
