# TOO MUCH WRANGLING
## 
### 
I have just finished reading our
■ newspaper's report concerning your
editorial of today entitled "Too
' Much Wrangling," and wish to state
i that if the article printed is as it
I reads in The Los Angeles Evening
i Herald, you, as well as your whole
j institution, should rightfully be
ashamed of yourselves for allowing
such unmatured comment to go in
' print.
The impression you naturally con
vey to the reading public is that
: Stanford men and women are a lot
■of poor sports, with emphasis on
the last two words.
Why is it that you northern in
i stitutiOns can't take a defeat with a
grin instead of forever crying about
| it for days afterwards?
Supposing Vic Williams had lest
the race to your man Hables—the
i Trojans would have won the meet
anyway, so why all the tears? Just
| remember—your athletes can't ex
pect to win all the major sports titles
I in one year.
