MAJOR AND MINOR LETTERS
(The Daily Princclonian)
Columbia University, in its recent
decision to cease differentiating be
tween major and minor sport
awards, took a decided step but one
which is not wholly without prece
dent. The general tendency in the
intercollegiate world during recent
years has been in the direction of
minimizing the distinction between
the sports. The movement had its
effect at Princeton last year when
it was determined to award to the
members of the so-called minor
sport teams a "P" which differs only
by two inches in height from the
major insignia. At a number of
other institutions, including Yale, it
is now being urged that Columbia's
example be followed.
In the last analysis, no single defi
nite basis for the present classifica
tion of sports as "major" and
"minor" can be found. The status oi
football,, baseball, crew, and track
can be attributed largely to their
long standing as recognized branches
of college athletics. At Princeton,
basketball and hockey have recent
ly been added to the list principally
because of their popularity from the
standpoint of the spectator. It is not
that hockey or basketball attract
more undergraduate competitors or
require more physical skill than
soccer or tennis. It is not that it is
more difficult to win a major than
a minor letter. On the other hand,
the classification is made solely on
bases which should receive little
recognition in the world of college
sport.'
Columbia's action in putting all
recognized sports on the same plane
insofar as awards ,are concerned, is
not only easily understood but is
also thoroughly in keeping with the
theory behind college athletics. The
primary purpose of college sport is
to benefit the undergraduate com
petitor, and it can scarcely be main
tained that greater benefit neces
sarily accrues to the players of a
major sport than to those engaged
in the other branches of athletics.
Then, in view of the fact that in
signia are theoretically designed to
furnish an incentive for athletic
competition, it is only reasonable
that the awards should be the same
for all recognized sports.

Last year the Princeton Under
graduate Athletic Committee, which
has complete autonomy in the mat
ter of controlling sport awards, very
appreciably lessened the difference
between the insignia. In so doing, it
recognized to a considerable degree
the inadvisability of placing the

MAJOR AND MINOR LETTERS
(The Daily Princclonian)
Columbia University, in its recent
decision to cease differentiating be
tween major and minor sport
awards, took a decided step but one
which is not wholly without prece
dent. The general tendency in the
intercollegiate world during recent
years has been in the direction of
minimizing the distinction between
the sports. The movement had its
effect at Princeton last year when
it was determined to award to the
members of the so-called minor
sport teams a "P" which differs only
by two inches in height from the
major insignia. At a number of
other institutions, including Yale, it
is now being urged that Columbia's
example be followed.
In the last analysis, no single defi
nite basis for the present classifica
tion of sports as "major" and
"minor" can be found. The status oi
football,, baseball, crew, and track
can be attributed largely to their
long standing as recognized branches
of college athletics. At Princeton,
basketball and hockey have recent
ly been added to the list principally
because of their popularity from the
standpoint of the spectator. It is not
that hockey or basketball attract
more undergraduate competitors or
require more physical skill than
soccer or tennis. It is not that it is
more difficult to win a major than
a minor letter. On the other hand,
the classification is made solely on
bases which should receive little
recognition in the world of college
sport.'
Columbia's action in putting all
recognized sports on the same plane
insofar as awards ,are concerned, is
not only easily understood but is
also thoroughly in keeping with the
theory behind college athletics. The
primary purpose of college sport is
to benefit the undergraduate com
petitor, and it can scarcely be main
tained that greater benefit neces
sarily accrues to the players of a
major sport than to those engaged
in the other branches of athletics.
Then, in view of the fact that in
signia are theoretically designed to
furnish an incentive for athletic
competition, it is only reasonable
that the awards should be the same
for all recognized sports.
