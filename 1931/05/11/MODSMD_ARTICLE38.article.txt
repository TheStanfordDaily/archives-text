## INTELLECTUAL BIGOTRY 
### 
It might seem that this title, "In
! tellectual Bigotry," is a contradic
! tion in itself; and in the highest
sense of the word, intellectual, it is.
| However, it is true that many per
| sons after acquiring a little knowl
edge, become disdainful of those that
| do not measure up to their attain
ments, and have nothing but scorn
for those who disagree with them.
I once had a professor in historical
j geology who believed in human evo
lution with the same surety that he
I believed the earth traveled around
the sun. For him, it was an unde
! niable fact; and he probably was
I correct. Nevertheless, his surety was
j no grounds for his giving vent to the
! most violent attacks on those "nar
i row-minded" bigots who refused to
I accept evolution." It would seem
I that his knowledge of the subject
i would make him tolerant of those
I who did not know; on the contrary,
j the fact that he was an authority in
| his field seemed to give him the best
j reason for revealing rabid bigotry.
Normally, such a man does not
! seem narrow-minded to his student
j because the student endorses his
I facts. But imagine for a moment
j that all his facts are wrong, and the
I violent narrowness of his intellect

becomes evident. And it is often true
that the individuals who feel their
views are based on facts, are the
most resistent to new ideas.
And this intellectual bigotry often
springs from the assumption that
two individuals should draw the
same conclusion from a given set
of facts. Then when one fails to
agree with the presenter of the in
formation, he accuses us either of
not understanding the facts or of
being too prejudiced to draw the
proper conclusions. In reality, how
ever, he is so convinced himself thai
his idea is the whole truth—nothing
but the truth—and the only truth,
that he cannot even conceive of in
telligent opposing views.
All of this does not mean that the
individual who seems to have ihe
proper information should drop all
of his opinions when faced by a
contrary view. That would be fool
ish. It does mean, however, that io
stick to an opinion because we
KNOW it is right—to refuse broad
minded consideration to an opposing
proposition because it seems contra
dictory to the facts that we have
considered, is bigotry; and bigotry
that is an efficient check on prog
