As the arc-lights of the State
College stadium were turned out
late Saturday night after the
fifth annual West Coast Relays
had been run oIT, Fresno put in
another bid for world fame. They
used to have very excellent rais
ins. Nov/ they have very excel
lent raisins ANI) the world's
greatest relay meet. Not only did
11 of their own records go into
the waste basket, but three
world's records went by the
hoards and all but one of the
best times, heights, and distances
of the 1931 Drake and Penn re
lays combined were bettered.

Undoubtedly the feature of the
evening's festivities was the new
world's time of 3:12.6 chalked up by
Stanford's human mile relay quar
ter, Maynor Shove, Les and Ike
Hables, and Ben Eastman. When
Baird, Taylor, Barbuti, and Spencer
ran a 3:13.4 three years ago in a
London fog, many an expert pre
dicted that the mark would stand
for years and years and years. Yet
here comes the Indian team to shave
nearly a second from this. And if
3:12.6 is ever bested, our guess is
that those who witnessed the per
formance of Templeton's four will
have very long, gray beards when
they read about a new world's mile
relay mark.

It might be argued that the
Shove - Ha Ides - Hablcs -Eastman
team may some day crack their
own record. It is true that the
baton pass from Shove to like
was not quite perfect. But the
others were. And there is prob
ably not a track in the world
today faster than the one which
supported so many excellent
times Saturday night. Then,
too, there was not a breath of
wind, and the temperature was
about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
With Shove graduating in June,
it is not likely tbat the Indian
"Hying four" will ever get to
gether again under such perfect
conditions.

Poor Vic Williams! We honestly
felt sorry for him as he took the
baton from Woessner and set out in
an attempt to overtake Bon Eastman
at top speed fully eight yards ahead
of him.

But to get back to those rec
ords. The new world's mark of
4(1.8 in the 110-yard dash un
doubtedly deserved all the pub
licity it is getting, but it is
rather an injustice to compare
it with Stanford U.'s mile mark.
In every American track meet,
an assault is made on the mile
relay record, since the event is a
regular one. Only in relay meets
is the 440 event staged, so some
of the world's best talent has
never had a crack at it.

This youngster, Floyd Wilson, of
Riverdale High School, cracked the
interscholastic world mark by jump
ing 23 feet1110 1 a inches in the after
noon. Today he may be thinking
Dean Cromwell is a pretty good guy,
and that those Trojan athletes he
met are a fine lot of boys.

Cast your eye over this compari
son of 193.1 Drake, Penn, and Fresno
relay marks.
