# Little Wins University Golfing Championship
## FROSH GOLF STAR CONQUERS SEAVER AND MACNAUGHTON Stanford Course Record, 69, Tied By Little In Pinal Match 
### 
Beating Malcolm MacNaughton, o
j and 4, Lawson Little won the 1931
I University golfing championship
| yesterday on the Stanford course.
Charlie Seaver fell before Little in
a 37 hole semi-final match Saturday.
The new champion practically
clinched victory in his match with
MacNaughton yesterday morning,
when he shot a 69, which left his
opponent seven down.
MacNaughton Rallies
Despite this depressing lead, Mac
played such fine golf in the after
| noon that he cut this deficit down to
! four holes at the 27th. Par golf on
j the part of Little checked this bud
| ding rally for two holes. Then Mac
| slipped over par on the 12th to go
| five down, and failed to slip through
i the door which Little left open on
I the 13th hole. The struggle ended on
j the next green when both men
I halved the hole.
| What really lost the match for
j MacNaughton was his putter. Miss
| ing short ones cost him at least three
i halves in the morning round, just
j when he needed every break to stem
I Little's hot streak. The champion, cn
j the contrary, was putting remarkably
I well all through the tournament,
j particularly under pressure.
Course Record
Little's 69 was a gem. It ties the
Stanford course record, which Sea-
I ver made against the California
| freshman, March 6. There was only
| one hole over par on his card, which
I included three birdies and fourteen
pars. It goes like this:
Little, out —453 444 434—35
Par, out—s43 444 543—36
Little, in—434 434 534—34
Par, in—444 434 534—35
In conquering Seaver on Saturday,
Little was playing 74 instead of 69
golf and he had to display great
competitive qualities to come
through.
Exciting Match
Their match was a thriller. Seaver
started well by winning the first
hole, then he lost three straight,
halved one, and won three straight
to fininsh the nine 1 up. Little shot
a 36 on the second nine to square
the match at the half-way mark.
Then he lost the first three holes
of the afternoon round and stared
defeat in the face. He fought his
way up to even terms at the 31st
only to have Seaver take two more
holes.
Little Gets Birdie
Little birdied the 34th. Came the
35 hole and the turning point of the
match. With an 18-inch putt to make
to putt Little dormie, Seaver missed.
They halved the 36th, due to Lit
tle's 15-foot sidehill putt. Then he
went on to win on the first extra
hole.
Winning Ways
He kept on winning the next day
to win the school championship for
the Class of '34.
Incidentally Herman Hell man gave
MacNaughton a stern struggle in the
other semi-final match Friday be
fore yielding, 2 down. His showing
and that of Little's are the big up
sets of the tourney. Both perform
ances are encouraging for Stanford's
golfing future.
