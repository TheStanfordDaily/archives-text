# STANFORD NETMEN ADVANCE IN COUNTY TENNIS TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
! . .
With six of its ten representatives !
remaining in the Santa Clara County
; tennis tournament at the end of the
I first two rounds, Stanford is making
I a strong bid for the honors won by
Harry Plymire last year. In this
year's play, besides Plymire, are nine .
singles players, including three
freshmen. There are also four dou- j
bles teams from the campus. Plymire
is seeded first and Niederauer, var
sity number six man, second.
First- and second-round matches, i
which were held over the week-end
at the San Jose Tennis Club, ended
with Plymire, Weesner, Petterson, '
j Blethen, Gordon, and Ellis surviving !
their contests. Niederauer suffered
an upset defeat Saturday at the

next year, and after their last games
have been played, this new sport
wilt give them still another oppor
tunity to distinguish themselves and
their University, by representing
their country before the world."
Phil Moffatt will make an ideal
halfback, in Maloney's opinion. In
rugby, the half corresponds to ihe
important quarterback position in
American football. And although
Moffatt has never played a game
of rugby, his football experience
should make it an easy matter for
him to lake an important place on
the team.
Hillman, Earhorn, Hulen, anpl
Dawson will all be leaving Stanford
after next year and in them Maloney
sees a nucleus of ideal forwards. He
is planning on having Phil Neil oc- j
cupy a place in the backfield with
Moffatt.
After he has given his men train- 1
ing in the fundamentals of rugby i
next year, Maloney intends to put I
them in actual competition before I
the Olympic Games tryouts. For this
purpose he will arrange a game :
with some Canadian rugby team.
hands of Howard Blethen, ranked
eleventh on the varsity, after three '
sets, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, notwithstanding
his second seeded position.
None of the Stanford representa- j
tives fell in the first round except i
Victor Ricketts, who was eliminated
by Weesner, and so far nnne has
bowed to an outside contender.
One of the best matches of the
day yesterday saw Chuck Otis,
freshman first man, bow to Harry
Plymire, 8-G, 6-4. An upset occurred
in one of the two third-round :
matches when Dan Ellis, third
freshman, downed Howard Blethen,
conqueror of Niederauer, in three
hard sets, 4-6, 9-7, 6-0.

Phil Moffatt will make an ideal
halfback, in Maloney's opinion. In
rugby, the half corresponds to ihe

him to lake an important place on
the team.
