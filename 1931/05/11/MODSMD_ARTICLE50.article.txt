# HARD RIDING CARD ALUMNI GAIN WIN OVER POLO TEAM
## Indians Lose, 9-6, Despite our Goal Handicap; Polo Pony Hurt 
### 
! Despite a four-goal handicap, the
! Stanford second-string polo team
! was defeated, 9 to (>, by a team com
| posed of alumni, at Encina Held Fri
j clay.
i Mounted on the unfamiliar Stan
| ford ponies, the alumni rode circles
I around their opponents. The main
defect of (he Cards was that they
did not ride hard enough. Doing
| good stickwork, the Indians had bet
! ter teamwork than the score would
I seem to indicate.
Howard and Dana Fuller of the
: alumni were the main props of their
J side, and the chief feature of the
j play of the alumni' team was the
I whirlwind game played by these
j two. They displayed not only superb
i hitting but also tine horsemanship.
One of the ponies was injured so
' badly that it had to be taken out
| of the game when two Cardinal
! players crashed into each other.
There were no substitutions dur
| ing the game. Line-ups were as fol
| lows:
i Stanford—Decker 1 (1), Carter 2
| (1), Clausen 3 (9), Howe 4 (0).
Alumni—Revel 11 (3), Fuller 2 (2),
j Howard 3 (3), Jensen 4 (1).
