# Golden Spike Driven 62 Years Ago By Stanford
## 
### 
Exactly G2 years ago this morning
Senator Leland Stanford lifted to his
capable shoulders a large sledge
hammer with which he drove home
the golden spike that marked the
completion of the first railroad that
linked the East with the just-de
veloping West. The Union Pacific,
building from Omaha, and the Cen
tral Pacific, building from Sacra
mento, had finished their whirlwind
construction, on government sub
sidy, of the new line.
The golden spike was the great
milestone in the success of both
railroads, and when it insured the
success of the Central Pacific, it in
sured the fortunes of California's
early Big 4, it insured the fortunes
early Big 4, Hopkins, Crocker,

t Huntington, and Stanford. Today's !
I Stanford University, therefore, is [
' built on a golden spike.
Present-day undergraduates, not
exactly noted for their habitual at- I
tendance at museums, are seldom j
aware of the fact that the first loco- !
| motive that traversed the historic j
I roadbed now rests peacefully in the j
| east wing of the local museum, wait- 1
j ing to be climbed over by anyone
i who wants to. Many bricklayers j
! were employed to remove one wall
I when the engine was brought in at !
| the turn of the century but, contrary
| to popular notion, the museum was
i not built around the engine.
So far as could be discovered late
| last night, no ceremonies will be
| held here today to commemorate .he j
I Senator's ability with the hammer. I
