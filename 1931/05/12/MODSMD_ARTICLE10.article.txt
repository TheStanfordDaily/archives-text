# NOMINEES IN COUNCIL RACE STATE VIEWS
## Honor Code Enforcement Generally Desired By Candidates 
### 
Asked yesterday to express their
opinions and campaign pledges in
respect to the Honor Code, candi
dates for Men's Council generally
agreed to support any decision on
the Code that the students vote to
day. The Daily was unable to find
the same agreement on the question
of how the nominees stood on the
value of an honor code in the first
place, although most of them ex
pressed faith in the theory of hon
or, and all of them want enforce
ment of something.

The following printed questions
were presented to every Men's
Council candidate: "Will you, if
elected to Men's Council, work for
the earnest and vigorous enforce
ment of the Honor Code? Will you
support the established policy of a
minimum of three quarters' suspen
sion from the University for the
first conviction of violation of the
Code, and permanent expulsion for
conviction of a second offense?"
Replies to this query are here
printed in full, listed in alphabetical
order in order to clinch beyond a
doubt the Daily's impartiality.
Ed Boyles: " 1 am whole-hear,ted
ly for the retention and maintenance
of the Honor Code in this Univer
sity. I 'believe that there is a pre
ponderance of honest effort on the
part of the gx-eat majority of the
students who are working here. 1
therefore regard it a duty of anyone
elected to the Men's Council to
strike out those members of the stu
dent body who cheat- in examina
tions and in other ways jeopardize
the chances of one's making the
most of his college training. I take
this opportunity of answering in the
affirmative the questions asked me
by the Daily."
John Bunting: "The Honor Code
be strictly enforced, with
some change in the system of re
porting violations."

William French: "It is my opin

1 should the students vote today to

Frank Gerbodc: ''I believe in and

George Griflin: "If elected I will
work for the vigorous enforcement
of the Honor Code but I believe the

Phil Humphreys: "The Honor

' grabbers' from raising class aver
ages by illicit means. The policy of

! cheating has occurred."
Harry Lee Logan: "I pledge my
self to the vigorous enforcement of
