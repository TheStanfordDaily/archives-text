Mosl important in the present election is the
choice of four men as members of Men's Council.
With thai body rests the enforcement of the Honor
Code as far as the great male majority of Stanford
students are concerned. It is vitally important that
; the men selected for the Council work earnestly
and honestly for the vigorous enforcement of the
j ('ode.

A "ccTlain siudcnl" who has three limes ap
peared before Men's (Council lor violating Ihe
Honor (lode, and Ivviee been eonvieted, is today a
candidate for that same body—whose duly it is to
enforce the (lode he refused to observe. %

Wlial can be the attitude towards enforcement
of a man who has twice been convicted of violating
the Honor (lode? Will he favor the sentencing of
other students for cheating as he cheated? Will he
approve of punishing them with three quarters'
suspension on iirst conviction and permanent ex
pulsion on second? ruder the policy announced
by Men's and Women's Councils in joint session
last quarter this "certain student" would have an
tomatically been expelled from Stanford never to
return again. Instead, here he is, a candidate
for Men's Council, despite the fact that twice Ins
academic conduct has been proved to be rotten as
far as the Honor Code is concerned.
Vigorous enforcement has not been the salient
characteristic of the present Council, which weak
ened just after it had announced a strong and ac
tive policy of enforcement. Whether next year's
Council will be a duplicate of the present body, or
whether il will be truly efficient in the enforcement
of the Honor Code will be determined in large part
today, in the selection of four of its members.
The four Men's Council posts are by far the
most important offices to be voted upon in today's
election. Kvcry member of the student body should
participate in this election, by casting his vote, and
