# McDowell Leads Search For Alumui 'Lost Souls'
## 
### Ann Adams 
| Four thousand "lost souls."
All of them were Stanford stu
! dents at one time, but have dropped
i out of campus life without leaving a
I trace behind them. To locate them
j is the task facing the Alumni Office,
which has John E. McDowell, 00,
as its chief "Sherlock Holmes.
The 19130 Alumni Directory occa
i sions this mad search for the lost
I race of "alums" and ex-students, the
! attempt to complete the ex-student
I record beginning in 1920. For the
1 last few months telephone books
! have been collected from all over
j the country, and cards sent out ask
] ing information from every person
' who could possibly have attended
'.Stanford,
i More than 1275 "hopelessly lost
! souls" as they are known in the
Alumni Office, have returned to the
i fold. A "lost soul" letter, giving the
latest news of Stanford, and a copy
of the Alumni Review, are sent to
renew acquaintance with each find.
Added color is lent to the search
by some of the letters which re
turn. One individual replied, "No,
! I have never gone to Stanford, but
if you find the missing man, I should
[ like to meet him, as some one of

I my own name.
Lending variety, one fcx-student
wrote back, "I went to Stanford
only one quarter, worked my way,
and flunked out. 1 have done better
| selling life insurance than if I'd
; been a mechanical engineer, any
way. I never had time for school
spirit, and I don't plan to send my
two children to Stanford." McDow
ell wrote at once and succeeded in
persuading him, as he has done with
! many others whose feeling for Stan
! ford is not entirely cordial, that it
j was not too late for a bit of Cardi
! nal spirit.
Through advertising, 700 former
j students have been found this
j month. Clews come in from all over
i the world. One alumni in Honolulu
I sent information on 25 of the miss
ing.
The biographical data remains
then at the service of the University,
of friends, or of newspapers seeking
to verify data. Most important—the
i B.A.C. addresses all football appli
cations from the alumni files.
The Stanford tribe is a nomadic
one. There are approximately 800
changes of address per month, and
about 100 alumni become "lost"
every month.
