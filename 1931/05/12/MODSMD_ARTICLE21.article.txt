# SIAMESE KING RESTS FROM EYE OPERATION
## 
### 
PURCHASE, N. Y.. May 11 (/I I ).â€”
A bulletin from attending physicians
late today said King Prajadhipok of
Siara, who yesterday underwent an
operation for removal of a cataract
from his left eye, was suffering no
pain and passed a restful night.
His eyes bandaged, the king had
to remain quiet, but if he continues
to improve he will be able shortly
to listen to concerts from his king
dom over a powerful radio receiving
set installed at Ophir Hall last week.
After the bandages are removed
he must wear dark glasses for a
time, but eventually with the aid of
special spectacles, his vision will, it
is believed, be virtually normal.
