WASHINGTON, May 11. (/P) â€”
The "Power Trust" was accused to
day by v Senator Brookhart of at
tempting to hinder construction of
the gigantic Boulder Canyon Dam
project and other reclamation un
dertakings.
The lowa Republican voiced this
view in a letter replying to a num
ber of identical communications
coming to his office urging that no
more funds be appropriated for
reclamation work on the ground
that such projects helped contribute
| to the surplus of farm products.
