# MEGALOMANIAC TIRADES

### 
Once upon ;i linn* The Daily published an editorial
which Ihe eslablished and mature Palo Alio Times did not
like. The Times then printed an editorial about The Daily,
which caused Ihe latter to register "slight displeasure."
The Daily replied, remarking, "when thai stentorian
mouthpiece of the city of Palo Alio deliberately misrepre
sents an argument of The Daily, il cannot refrain from
registering slight displeasure. Of course one should never
register displeasure when one is misrepresented, but then,
we are young; the Palo Alio Times reeks with age and ex
perience."
Once again Ihe Times has seen lit lo misrepresent The
Daily. Kditoriallv the Times yesterday declared: "The
oilier day Ihe current editor of the Stani ohi) Daily' thumb
nosed the University of Southern California for indulging
in 'college stuff.' . . . And yet, simultaneously, this same
editor carries on Ihe campaign of his predecessors against
llie move to continue the transition of Stanford into a
graduate institution. With megalomaniac tirades every
(teademie and administrative development is seen as an
other shove of dear old Alma Maler toward the abyss into
which President Wilbur headed it. A bunch of alumni and
a lot more students have said that such a change would
ruin athletics and school spirit. Taking the statement as
divinely inspired prophecy, The Daily has waged its youth
fully optimistic campaign to halt Ihe mills of the gods with
editorials. . . ."
The Times makes Iwo gross misstatements. First, it de
clares that The Daily has opposed "every academic and
administrative development." Second, il asserts that The
Daily has opposed the transition of Stanford into a grad
uate institution because "such a change would ruin ath
letics and school spirit."
The Daily has not looked askance upon every academic
and administrative policy of the University far from il
and would appreciate the Times proving its point.
The Daily has made no mention of athletics and school
spirit in its discussion of the lower division, junior college
question. Of the junior college The Daily has said, "The
junior college may indeed be an established part of our
educational system, but it*has not yet proven itself an ade
quate substitute for the first two years of university work.
Too much may have been expected of the junior college,
but the fact remains that it has not yet shown itself to be
other than just two more years of high school." On this
and 011 its view of the value of the four-year collegiate
education, The Daily has based ils opinion as regards the
suggested abolition of the lower division. There are as
many able educators lo support this view as there are
those to approve Ihe Times' stand. And yet the latter
brands as "megalomaniac tirades" The Daily's editorials.
The Palo Alto Times misrepresents, and il assumes
much, chiefly I hat il is right.
