# AN IDLE GESTURE
## 
### 
The Wickersham report having proved the most gi
iitic fiasco in the history of this era of investigation,
probes and committees, the prohibition chiefs of the na
tion have decided to go to the colleges to discover the
wherefore and the wherefore not about the noble experi
ment.
From Prohibition Director Amos Woodcock has come
the announcement of the formation of an advisory re
search council designed "to ascertain the truth regarding
the operation of the Eighteenth Amendment," said council
to operate in the universities and gather information from
the theses of graduate students.
Two questions which the* writers of the theses will
strive to answer arc these: "How has the operation of the
Eighteenth Amendment affected child delinquency?" and
"How has it affected juvenile drinking?"
.lust wh\ Director Woodcock must go to the colleges
to find the answers to those two queries constitutes some
thing of a puzzler, unless collegians are to be included in
the list of "juvenile" drinkers, which is perfectly all right
with The Daii.v. Hut all that is rather beside the point.
The real question to be answered is,"How has the Eight
eenth Amendment affected the average American?"
It is doubtful it' nil your Wickersham commissions and
all your collegiate theses can answer this as prohibition
advocates would have them answer it.
