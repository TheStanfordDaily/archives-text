THE DECLINE OF LIBERALISM
(The Minnesota Daily)
On May 13, The New Republic
will publish a tract by William Har
lan Hale, called "A Dirge for Col
lege Liberalism." Mr. Hale bewails
the decline and near-extinction of
liberalism in American universities
and colleges, and offers examples to
prove his point. The American stu
dent, for instance, as he shows, is
almost oblivious of political move
ments; his interest in liberal discus
sion clubs has almost expired; and
he has accepted the dicta of au
thority without a disenting murmur.
In matters of opinion and intelligent
thought, Mr. Hale believes that the
college student is entirely apathetic.
This is in the main true. At Min
nesota, as an instance, there are but
two organizations which could be
called liberal in temper, and which
are known at all to the student
body as a whole. The first of these
two is the International Forum, to
whose meetings are invited educa
tors and men of protracted experi
ence. It would be foolish, however,
to assume that every Forum speak
er is a man of liberal thought; offi
cials of the organization have no
such idea in mind when they secure
their speakers. The second organi
zation is known as the Ben Johnson
Club. It meets once a week, and its
doors are open to anyone in the
University, although the nature and
time of these meetings are not pub
licized.
As for the rest of the student
body, it is largely phlegmatic and
apathetic in its attitude. It has little
or no interest in politics, or in mod
ern thought and opinion. It is given
to fripperies and the "right thing
to do"; it falls squarely in line with
the mode of the moment; it apes
fashion and manners.

There are a number of reasons
i for this. The suppression of liber
? alism, for one thing, has been more
i effectively accomplished by frater
nity politics dealing with college
| publications lhan any administrative
i coercion could have done. The gen-
I eral shallowness and heedlessness of j
i the age has also infiltrated into the
! college campus.
But chief among all the causes of
the decline of liberalism is the lack
I of time which confronts the average
! college student today. He is too
pressed by his purely curricular de
mands; he has no time for politics,
for discussion, or for meditation. A
! university education today means
I four years of incessant bustle and
' agitation. Liberalism has declined
I only insofar as the demands of a
'■ university education have them
! selves intensified and have become
I so variegated.

lan Hale, called "A Dirge for Col
lege Liberalism." Mr. Hale bewails
the decline and near-extinction of
liberalism in American universities
and colleges, and offers examples to
prove his point. The American stu
dent, for instance, as he shows, is
almost oblivious of political move
ments; his interest in liberal discus
sion clubs has almost expired; and
he has accepted the dicta of au
thority without a disenting murmur.
In matters of opinion and intelligent
thought, Mr. Hale believes that the
college student is entirely apathetic.
This is in the main true. At Min
nesota, as an instance, there are but
two organizations which could be
called liberal in temper, and which
are known at all to the student
body as a whole. The first of these
two is the International Forum, to
whose meetings are invited educa
tors and men of protracted experi
ence. It would be foolish, however,
to assume that every Forum speak
er is a man of liberal thought; offi
cials of the organization have no
such idea in mind when they secure
their speakers. The second organi
zation is known as the Ben Johnson
Club. It meets once a week, and its
doors are open to anyone in the
University, although the nature and
time of these meetings are not pub
licized.
As for the rest of the student
body, it is largely phlegmatic and
apathetic in its attitude. It has little
or no interest in politics, or in mod
ern thought and opinion. It is given
to fripperies and the "right thing
to do"; it falls squarely in line with
the mode of the moment; it apes
fashion and manners.

There are a number of reasons
i for this. The suppression of liber
? alism, for one thing, has been more
i effectively accomplished by frater
nity politics dealing with college
| publications lhan any administrative
i coercion could have done. The gen-
I eral shallowness and heedlessness of j
i the age has also infiltrated into the
! college campus.
But chief among all the causes of
the decline of liberalism is the lack
I of time which confronts the average
! college student today. He is too
pressed by his purely curricular de
mands; he has no time for politics,
for discussion, or for meditation. A
! university education today means
I four years of incessant bustle and
' agitation. Liberalism has declined
I only insofar as the demands of a
'■ university education have them
! selves intensified and have become
I so variegated.
