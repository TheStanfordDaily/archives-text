# CHESTERTON'S MISTAKE

(The University Daily Kansan)
Gilbert K. Chesterton, British au
' thor, reporting to the Society for
Preservation of Rural England, had
j this to say of his visit to America:
"I've been in Tennessee, where if
a man insults you, you are expected
to shoot him, or you're not consid
ered a gentleman. Call it barbarism
or chivalry, it's the feudal spirit full
i of feud.
j "There are no inns in America but
1 there is plenty to drink—far, far too
much. Alcoholism has never threat
j ened disaster as it is threatening
; America today. It isn't normal that
j girls of sixteen should go to dances
j and drink raw alcohol."
We're sorry that Mr. Chesterton
j has such an unbiased attitude about
j conditions in America. We could
I add that, while we have not ye olde
j inns of England, we have our speak-
I easies—no doubt cultural advantages
i that are denied to our friends across
| the seas. And, about our 16-year
j olds drinking raw alcohol? Surely,
J Mr. Chesterton is mistaken. For we
J have seen with our own eyes husky
I athletes try to drink raw alcohol.
I They just couldn't do it; they use
j either water or ginger ale to dilute
it. America may be wild, but its
i wildriess seems to have agreed with
j it in many Ways.
