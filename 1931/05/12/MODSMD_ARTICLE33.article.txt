# BULL SESSION
## THIS IS VOTE DAY 
### 
Today—if the swimming pools do j
not prove too attractive —it is hoped j
that at least 1,200 students will [
march to the polls and vindicate the j
much-abused institution of student I
self-government. The theory is that i
the students —the "upper fwe per |
cent," and the hope of America— ;
will judge the relative merits of the |
candidates and place an "X" oppo- i
site the most capable. Of course, j
how the students can do this without
knowing the candidates or their 1
views is extremely doubtful—but i
this can be glossed over for the sake
of keeping "dirty politics" out of !
Stanford.
It may be worthwhile to note in
view of the controversy over "write- .
in" elections last quarter than in the !
primary—and today's election is a j
primary—the student can write in !
the name of a candidate if none of j
those offered suit him. This likewise j
implies that students running with- j
out opposition are not assured of j
victory unless they receive enough j
votes to overcome write-in candi- j
dates. This of course means that !
those students favoring the six can
didates that are running without
opposition must be sure to vote for
their candidates if the theory of
popular choice is to reign supreme, j
Probably of more actual signifi- 1
cance than the 54 names on the bal- !
lot or anything else involved in the !
election are the four questions con- j
cerning the Honor Code. The Execu- J
tivc Committee is no doubt taxing I
political patience by asking students ,
to answer four questions. It would j
be highly complimentary to Stanford
intelligence, however, if the major- j
ity of the student body were to i
answer all these questions. It is in- I

i dispensable, if this Honor Code
! business is to be settled; that stu
j dents take the trouble of registering
| their opinion on at least the first
question: "Do you believe the Honor
Code is in successful operation at
Stanford?"
One hears a,ll kinds of statements
regarding the amount of cheating
that goes on. Some near-sighted in
dividuals claim there is no dishon
| esty in examinations. Other people,
J who must positively spend the en
! tire examination period spotting
j chcaters, claim that the majority
; use underhand schemes to roll up
! the old "Bawl-out" record. The
! truth lies somewhere between these
| two extremes, and if the policy in
' regards to examinations is really to
i ever be based on more than indi
: vidual opinions, high-sounding
I ideals, or glorious tradition, the stu
; dents today must give a frank an
■ swer to these four questions.
In voting on constitutional amend
' ments (which must be distinguished
| from the questions on the Honor
; Code) there are usually a group of
i individuals who vote "yes" and an
other group who vote "no" irre
spective of the content ol" the propo
sition. As a rule amendments mean
little but technical changes; and
j three of today's alternations are lit—
I tie more than such changes. The
I fourth amendment, however, would
! give 50 students a chance to modify
' the constitution rather than an un
j wieldy number of 500. While 50 is
I too small a number, it must be ad
| mitted that 500 is almost impossible
j so a "yes" on number four will give
the students the easy chance to pro
! pose amendments to the constitution
I now in force.

Today—if the swimming pools do j
not prove too attractive —it is hoped j
that at least 1,200 students will [
march to the polls and vindicate the j
much-abused institution of student I
self-government. The theory is that i
the students —the "upper fwe per |
cent," and the hope of America— ;
will judge the relative merits of the |
candidates and place an "X" oppo- i
site the most capable. Of course, j
how the students can do this without
knowing the candidates or their 1
views is extremely doubtful—but i
this can be glossed over for the sake
of keeping "dirty politics" out of !
Stanford.
It may be worthwhile to note in
view of the controversy over "write- .
in" elections last quarter than in the !
primary—and today's election is a j
primary—the student can write in !
the name of a candidate if none of j
those offered suit him. This likewise j
implies that students running with- j
out opposition are not assured of j
victory unless they receive enough j
votes to overcome write-in candi- j
dates. This of course means that !
those students favoring the six can
didates that are running without
opposition must be sure to vote for
their candidates if the theory of
popular choice is to reign supreme, j
Probably of more actual signifi- 1
cance than the 54 names on the bal- !
lot or anything else involved in the !
election are the four questions con- j
cerning the Honor Code. The Execu- J
tivc Committee is no doubt taxing I
political patience by asking students ,
to answer four questions. It would j
be highly complimentary to Stanford
intelligence, however, if the major- j
ity of the student body were to i
answer all these questions. It is in- I

i dispensable, if this Honor Code
! business is to be settled; that stu
j dents take the trouble of registering

question: "Do you believe the Honor
Code is in successful operation at

j chcaters, claim that the majority
