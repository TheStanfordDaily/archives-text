## INTELLIGENT PUBLIC OPINION NEEDED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In Monday's issue of The Daily,
there appeared a Campus Opinion
letter entitled "Better to Train
Now." I do not care to ridicule the
i letter, but I cannot let Mr. Muller's
illogical statements go unchallenged.
I Each of his three main points in de
fense of military organization seem
1 to me quite untenable.
First, Mr. Muller states that we
shall always have wars until greed
and jealousy can be abolished. Such
an argument was as applicable to
| duelling in the nineteenth century
as it is to war today; yet duelling
has been abolished without the re
i moval of these causes. The greed
and jealousy that cause war are
concentrated in the brains of a small
: class of the people—largely capi
! talists and propagandists of various
sorts. Surely the possibility exists
of controlling these individuals as
individuals were controlled in the
matter of duelling. We might have
been told a hundred years ago that
because slavery had existed since
the earliest time of man, it could
never be abolished; today, it is prac
| lically non-existent. How then can
we say that the abolition of war is
! impossible?
Secondly, Mr. Muller asks, "Who
ever heard of anybody picking on a
boxer." The man whom the boxer
may fear is another of his own type
and training. In fact, two men of
pugnacious inclinations are more

I likely to find themselves engaged in
I physical combat than are men of
i more discreet manners. I can im
agine that a boxer's first thought
when faced with an unpleasant sit
uation is to raise his lists; so will
armed nations.
Thirdly, Mr. Muller states, "We
' don't want military training to start
! wars; we want military training to
| stop wars." If the idea back of his
j statement is correct, he has dis
proved the theory that history re
| peats itself; and unless we disre
| gard the example of 1914, we cannot
| agree (hat military preparation
1 helps to stop or prevent wars,
j On the contrary, militarism is
j generally believed by historians to
j have been a major cause of the
| Great War. History also gives us
j examples of a nation withholding
from war because of the military
superiority of its rival; but I can
think of no scheme of throwing the
j nations out of balance so that each
! will refrain from war because of
the superiority of another. I take
for granted that it is out of the
question that the United States
should or could dominate the world
military superidrity.
I am making no dogmatic asser
| tions as to the possibilities of per
| manent peace; I say only that preju
! dice and illogical thinking will not
I serve to solve the problem, while
the formation and expression of an
I intelligent public opinion may.

The Editor, Sir:
In Monday's issue of The Daily,
there appeared a Campus Opinion
letter entitled "Better to Train
Now." I do not care to ridicule the
i letter, but I cannot let Mr. Muller's
illogical statements go unchallenged.
I Each of his three main points in de
fense of military organization seem
1 to me quite untenable.
First, Mr. Muller states that we
shall always have wars until greed
and jealousy can be abolished. Such
an argument was as applicable to
| duelling in the nineteenth century
as it is to war today; yet duelling
has been abolished without the re
i moval of these causes. The greed
and jealousy that cause war are
concentrated in the brains of a small
: class of the people—largely capi
! talists and propagandists of various
sorts. Surely the possibility exists
of controlling these individuals as
individuals were controlled in the
matter of duelling. We might have
been told a hundred years ago that
because slavery had existed since
the earliest time of man, it could
never be abolished; today, it is prac
| lically non-existent. How then can
we say that the abolition of war is
! impossible?
Secondly, Mr. Muller asks, "Who
ever heard of anybody picking on a
boxer." The man whom the boxer
may fear is another of his own type
and training. In fact, two men of
pugnacious inclinations are more

I likely to find themselves engaged in
I physical combat than are men of
i more discreet manners. I can im
agine that a boxer's first thought
when faced with an unpleasant sit
uation is to raise his lists; so will
armed nations.
Thirdly, Mr. Muller states, "We
' don't want military training to start
! wars; we want military training to
| stop wars." If the idea back of his
j statement is correct, he has dis
proved the theory that history re
| peats itself; and unless we disre
| gard the example of 1914, we cannot
| agree (hat military preparation
1 helps to stop or prevent wars,
j On the contrary, militarism is
j generally believed by historians to
j have been a major cause of the
| Great War. History also gives us
j examples of a nation withholding
from war because of the military
superiority of its rival; but I can
think of no scheme of throwing the
j nations out of balance so that each
! will refrain from war because of
the superiority of another. I take
for granted that it is out of the
question that the United States
should or could dominate the world
military superidrity.
I am making no dogmatic asser
| tions as to the possibilities of per
| manent peace; I say only that preju
! dice and illogical thinking will not
I serve to solve the problem, while
the formation and expression of an
I intelligent public opinion may.
