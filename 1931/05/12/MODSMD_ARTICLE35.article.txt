# A 						REGRETTABLE SITUATION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I notice in today's Daily the can
dicacy of a certain student for the
offices of Men's Council and the
vice-presidency of the Class of 1932.
What brings him to my attention
is the fact that three times has he
been before the same body he is
now running for and has been con
victed twice of violating the Honor
Code. I would like to ask what type
of justice can a man who has been
j convicted twice render?

I Added to this is the analogy that
! in most states once a man is con
victed of a major crime he loses his
rights to run for political office, and
here at Stanford a man—expelled
i from the University for half a quar
ter—has come back jind is a candi
date for the office. I suggest that to
prevent the recurrence of a similar
situation that all convicted Honor
Code violators be denied the right
to run for office.
