SEDUCTION AD ADSURDUM:
PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE
OF SEDUCTION—By Emily Hahn.
Brewer and Warren. I MO.
Several months ago this instruc
tive little treatise appeared in select
bookstores throughout the country;
but we, having a previous engage
ment with number 1127 (Playing a
Lone Hand) of the Nicholas Carter
series, have only recently been able
to read it.
This is frankly a beginners' hand
book but interesting in that it con
siders a wide range of subtle wheed
lings. Miss Hahn's studies have car
ried her into representative bed
rooms of the land. Indeed, she has
been tireless and painstaking in her
effort to make the research complete.
Particularly beautiful are the na
tural touches she introduces: there
is a splendid evening scene on an
almost deserted bathing beach and
several episodes in canyons and
quarries reveal an adeptness at
poetic contrivance not usually found
in the cold gleanings of a scientific
dissertation.
For the neophyte this tome should
be of considerable interest. To the
experienced it may prove a divert
ing history. —J.S.S.

ORANGE VALLEY—By Howard
Baker. Coward-McCann, 1931. $2.
Howard Baker, two years ago an
English instructor at Stanford, has
written a first novel of great im
portance. The book, "Orange Val
ley," is a powerful, expertly eon
trolled psychological study of a man
and woman in the San Joaquin Val
ley of California.
Considering individuality of char
acters, plot gradation, presentation
of social conditions (the brief refer
ences to these are invaluable), and
satisfactory emotional effect, "Or
ange Valley" is one of the best nov
els written in America. If we use
these four points as a criterion,
Glenway Wescott is not comparable;
Ernest Hemingway, infinitely pol
ished, is less ambitious; Moi ley Cal
laghan's fine satire is replaced in
Baker's novel by a strong sugges
tion of tragedy. Among contempor
ary fiction writers, Elizabeth seems
to have set a standard which Baker
more than any other novelist has
attained.
Some of these remarks are made
clear in the following excerpt:
He would not be troubled. One
lives painfully and briefly, and close
to a burning country. One should
have whatever peace there may be.
"I think I'll write to Magine,"
Charles said.
"Yes, why don't you?" Juliana
said. —A.H.

HESPERIAN—Edited hy James D.
Hart. Spring issue 1931.
According to its editor, who in
his spare time is a junior at Stan
ford, Hesperian is a "little maga
zine," issued occasionally, in order
to give the little-known but able
writers of California and the West
in general a public.
This issue contains an interesting
article by Diego Rivera, a few il
luminating examples of modern;
poetry and several unusual short |
stories.
The font used by the printer and j
the make-up are particularly pleas- !
ing. It does not put "up a fight
against the established order" and 1
in that, among other ways, is a re- '
lief from the usual run of small and j
struggling publications such as the !
late lamentable College Forum.

Considering individuality of char
acters, plot gradation, presentation
of social conditions (the brief refer

satisfactory emotional effect, "Or

these four points as a criterion,
Glenway Wescott is not comparable;
Ernest Hemingway, infinitely pol
ished, is less ambitious; Moi ley Cal

Baker's novel by a strong sugges

to have set a standard which Baker
more than any other novelist has
attained.

lives painfully and briefly, and close

HESPERIAN—Edited hy James D.
Hart. Spring issue 1931.
According to its editor, who in
his spare time is a junior at Stan
ford, Hesperian is a "little maga
zine," issued occasionally, in order
to give the little-known but able
writers of California and the West
in general a public.
This issue contains an interesting
article by Diego Rivera, a few il
luminating examples of modern;
poetry and several unusual short |
stories.
The font used by the printer and j
the make-up are particularly pleas- !
ing. It does not put "up a fight
against the established order" and 1
in that, among other ways, is a re- '
lief from the usual run of small and j
struggling publications such as the !
late lamentable College Forum.

SEDUCTION AD ADSURDUM:
PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE
OF SEDUCTION—By Emily Hahn.
Brewer and Warren. I MO.
Several months ago this instruc
tive little treatise appeared in select
bookstores throughout the country;
but we, having a previous engage
ment with number 1127 (Playing a
Lone Hand) of the Nicholas Carter
series, have only recently been able
to read it.
This is frankly a beginners' hand
book but interesting in that it con
siders a wide range of subtle wheed
lings. Miss Hahn's studies have car
ried her into representative bed
rooms of the land. Indeed, she has
been tireless and painstaking in her
effort to make the research complete.
Particularly beautiful are the na
tural touches she introduces: there
is a splendid evening scene on an
almost deserted bathing beach and
several episodes in canyons and
quarries reveal an adeptness at
poetic contrivance not usually found
in the cold gleanings of a scientific
dissertation.
For the neophyte this tome should
be of considerable interest. To the
experienced it may prove a divert
ing history. —J.S.S.

ORANGE VALLEY—By Howard
Baker. Coward-McCann, 1931. $2.
Howard Baker, two years ago an
English instructor at Stanford, has
written a first novel of great im

trolled psychological study of a man
and woman in the San Joaquin Val
ley of California.
Considering individuality of char
acters, plot gradation, presentation
of social conditions (the brief refer
ences to these are invaluable), and
