# CABBAGES and Things..
## 
### 
We sometimes wonder just what
it is people think Cabbages is sup
posed to be. Have had accusations
for everything from libel, editorial
graft, to maintaining a vital statistic
caolumn.
Of course, there's really most
need for the last one. Any one
can he libelous, hut it takes a
genius to keep deaths and di
vorces straight in this country.
(That's why they usually aren't
straight, of course.)
Anyhow, the next person who ac
cuses us of running a humour col
umn is going to get sadly wounded
or maybe a phone call from Ihi
Registrar's Office. Don't tell vis il
not.funny. Who said it was supposec
i to be? If a fellow has a roommat*
! who cracks awful puns all the time
j can he be blamed for passing then
| on, once in awhile?
In all events, there are a lot of
different kinds of our particular
j vegetable in the public markets.
Sometimes they're crabhages,
and sometimes plain rabid.
(Rabids like cabbages, you
know.)
Crabbages offer a chance for per
i sonal spite. The rabids are save.
| for political issues—they grow an
j grow, and then all of a sudden yo
I have a drastic measure to preset
to the world.
Home-grown cabbages are alwriy
! the best—pure, always; tubercula
tested, usually. We plan on truck
gardening as a career, someda*
when the family throws us out int
! the gutter.
You always take a chance on
imported vegetables. Of course
we can't be outspoken enough to
ask for things off of other peo
ple's delivery wagons, so we
borrow.
But the modern generation choost
j to snort, rather than laugh. So \\
can use overripe ones, or green one
or practically anything, and the el
feet is the same old story of ptc
maine and the clay after.
Things are a little harder to
classify. Under the heading come
little dirty digs that aren't big
enough to be railed by thei /
right names yet. And political
jibes, or soft-soaping for injured
athletes' pride.
The "and" in the title has nev>
been given enough notice. From ne
on, it's going to siand for the que
, tion and answers bureau—like tl
cash registed on the end of tl
counter. Seriously—we think th

I been getting the step on us for t<

Write us about your particul
j problem, so we can laugh at it.
