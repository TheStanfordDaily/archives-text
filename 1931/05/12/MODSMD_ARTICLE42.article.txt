Robert Tyre Jones created
quite a Hurry among the crowd
gathered in the Stadium for the
Stanford-Troy dual meet last
week, by iust sitting in the
stands like any other ordinary
paid customer. Primarily, the
"world's greatest golfer" became
an idol of the nation through his
ability to play "high calibre"
golf, consistently and under the
stress of most trying conditions.
Had Bobby played the Stanford
course during his visit, there is
little doubt that a record gal
lery would have followed him
around.
But most of the funs who would
have turned out wouldn't have come
around for the sole purpose of see
ing "perfect" golf displayed by the
brilliant leader. Just like other idols,
Jones has become a favorite with
"The Great American Public," in
cluding thousands who have never
been on a golf course. Some who
don't know a niblic from a water
hazard tramp over miles of fairway
to watch him play.
Ft must take a Jones to get
tuition payers of this institution
to turn out. "High calibre" golf
is evidently not enough. If it
were, more than a mere handful
of fans would have been on hand
at the University course over
the week-end to witness a brand
of divot digging seldom dupli
cated anywhere. Or else stu
dents here don't realize that golf
that even "Bobby the Great" sel
dom betters is often exhibited
literally in the Farm backyard.
Lawson Little, in winning the Uni
versity championship from Malcolm
MacNaughton Sunday, shot a C9,
two under par, to become the third
Cardinal golfer who has played the
difficult links in course record fig
ures. MacNaughton did it last year,
though he was playing from short
lees. Charley Seaver rang up a 69
when playing in team competition
against California's freshmen a
month ago, with the long tees in
vogue.
Seaver and Little need no in
troduction to any of the golf
minded in America. Both of
them have reached the semi
finals of the national amateur
tourney on different occasions.
Both have three years of var
sity competition ahead of them,
and if Stanford ever sends a
team back to the Intercollegiate
matches in the East, this pair
will aid in bringing national
fame to the Farm in another
sport.
Two of Stanford's crack trio are
products of a golf-famous town in
the Northwest, Portland, Oregon,
home of the Moe and Dolp brothers,
Rudy Wilhelm, and Doctor O. F.
Willing of Walker Cup fame. While
in high school there, Little used to
i pond most of his time on Waverlpy
Country Club course, where he and
his dad cleaned up on all "father
and son" tourneys. Col. Little is
something of a golfer himself, slip
ping irjto the high seventies on oc
casions.

MacNaughton hails from Os
wego Club in the "Rose City."
In high school he mingled with
fast golfing company, since he
was third man on a four-man
prep team which included Don
ald K. lVIoe and Vincent I)olp.
Mac is graduating in June, but
golf at Stanford will continue
on a championship plane for
some years to come. Besides
Seaver and Little, the Class of
Ml has Gerry Trautman and
Jack Hoerner, both scratch
golfers at their home town clubs.

is evidently not enough. If it
were, more than a mere handful
of fans would have been on hand
at the University course over
the week-end to witness a brand
of divot digging seldom dupli

that even "Bobby the Great" sel
dom betters is often exhibited
literally in the Farm backyard.
Lawson Little, in winning the Uni
versity championship from Malcolm
MacNaughton Sunday, shot a C9,
two under par, to become the third
Cardinal golfer who has played the
difficult links in course record fig
ures. MacNaughton did it last year,
though he was playing from short
lees. Charley Seaver rang up a 69
when playing in team competition
against California's freshmen a
month ago, with the long tees in
vogue.
Seaver and Little need no in
troduction to any of the golf
minded in America. Both of
them have reached the semi
finals of the national amateur
tourney on different occasions.
Both have three years of var
sity competition ahead of them,
and if Stanford ever sends a
team back to the Intercollegiate
matches in the East, this pair
will aid in bringing national
fame to the Farm in another
sport.
Two of Stanford's crack trio are
products of a golf-famous town in
the Northwest, Portland, Oregon,
home of the Moe and Dolp brothers,
Rudy Wilhelm, and Doctor O. F.
Willing of Walker Cup fame. While
in high school there, Little used to
i pond most of his time on Waverlpy
Country Club course, where he and
his dad cleaned up on all "father
and son" tourneys. Col. Little is
something of a golfer himself, slip
ping irjto the high seventies on oc
casions.

MacNaughton hails from Os
wego Club in the "Rose City."
In high school he mingled with
fast golfing company, since he
was third man on a four-man
prep team which included Don
ald K. lVIoe and Vincent I)olp.
Mac is graduating in June, but
golf at Stanford will continue
on a championship plane for
some years to come. Besides
Seaver and Little, the Class of
Ml has Gerry Trautman and
Jack Hoerner, both scratch
golfers at their home town clubs.

Robert Tyre Jones created
quite a Hurry among the crowd
gathered in the Stadium for the
Stanford-Troy dual meet last
week, by iust sitting in the
stands like any other ordinary
paid customer. Primarily, the
"world's greatest golfer" became
an idol of the nation through his
ability to play "high calibre"
golf, consistently and under the
stress of most trying conditions.
Had Bobby played the Stanford
course during his visit, there is
little doubt that a record gal
lery would have followed him
around.
But most of the funs who would
have turned out wouldn't have come
around for the sole purpose of see
ing "perfect" golf displayed by the
brilliant leader. Just like other idols,
Jones has become a favorite with
"The Great American Public," in
cluding thousands who have never
been on a golf course. Some who
don't know a niblic from a water
hazard tramp over miles of fairway
to watch him play.

tuition payers of this institution
