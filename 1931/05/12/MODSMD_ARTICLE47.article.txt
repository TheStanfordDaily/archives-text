# DAILY WRITER PUTS FOUR STANFORD MEN ON ALL-STAR BASEBALL TEAM FOR 1931
## 
### FRANCIS LLOYD 
Naming four Stanford men in an
all-California Association Baseball
team, the Daily herewith presents its
selections for the past season.
Very few people should object to
the selection of Dan Johnson, Stan
ford pitcher, as the leading mounds
man during the past season. Horner,
California, gets second choice, with
Buchanan, U.S.C., a close third.
The catching position is more dif- ,
ficult, however, considering all ihe
factors, the palm is given to Ward, i
U.S.C., who just beat out Smith,
California, for the receiving job.
Arbelbide, U.S.C.. has an unchal
lenged hold on first, with Hardy, '
Stanford, next in line.
Because of his hitting and general
alertness, Hildebrand, U.S.C., gets
the call over Philippi, Stanford, and
Rhode, California, for second base- j

] man. Even though Mohler, U.S.C.,
led the league hitting, his fielding
was sloppy, and so Dclmas, Stanford,
1 wins shortstop.
Third base is unquestionably
given to Dykes Johnson, Stanford,
who is also nominated for the classi
est ground ball taker in the league.
The outfield is composed of Kirwan,
California, Rintala, Stanford, and
i Powers, Santa Clara. Honorable
I mention goes to Hunlcen and Camp
l bell of Stanford, and Boswell, U.S.C.
