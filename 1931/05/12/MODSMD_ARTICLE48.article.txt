# PROGRESS IN MURAL TENNIS TOURNEY IS SLOW, SAYS BUGGE
## 
### 
With many days elapsed since the
last intramural tennis match, Coach
Elwyn Bugge strongly urges the four
teams holding up the procession to
settle their contests.
With all the quarter-final brackets
filled and two of (he semi-finals, the
farthest advanced teams, Sigma Nu
and Southerners If, are held up
pending filling of the two remaining
vacancies opposite them. Delta Up
silon and Encina Basement are to
meet for the right to face Sigma Nu
in the upper half, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon will tangle with the South
erners 111 in the lower half to gain
a match with Southerners 11.
Thus, when these tardy quarter
final matches are played, the semi
final round will consist of Sigma Nu
vs. either D.U. or Encina Basement,
and Southerners II vs. either S.A.E.
or the Southerners 111. Both Sigma
Nu and the Southerners II have
strong teams. George Bergstrom and
Hubert Butler represent the frater
nity, and Petterson and Gordon, both
high ranking men among the var
sity, play for the Southerners.
