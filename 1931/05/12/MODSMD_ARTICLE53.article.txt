# Card Team Works Out For C.I. Meet Saturday
## EASTMAN IS CARD HOPE FOR 880 YD. WORLD'S RECORD Spectacular Individual Lap Times in Fresno Relay Are Revealed 
### Fritz Goodwin 
While four newly crowned world
champions trotted around in new
track suits, waiting to have their
picture taken, Dink Templeton put
his Indian squad through a light
workout at the Stadium oval yester
day afternoon.
The Stanford track coach does not
plan 011 working his men very hard
this week, in spite of the fact that
the California Intercollegiates are
coming up in the Los Angeles Coli
seum Saturday.
lielap Lap Times
As another interesting fact on the
record-breaking mile relay at
Fresno Saturday night, about which
Farm fans will talk for clays on end,
now come the individual lap times
of the Indian quartet.
Maynor Shove, starting from a
crouch, ran the first 440 yards in
48.8 seconds, passing the baton to
Ike Hablcs, who repeated his team
mate's performance to the tenths of
seconds. Les Hables ran the third
lap in the excellent 440 time of 47.8,
and Ben Eastman stopped the
watches at the finish tape in 47.2.
440-Yard Record
The accepted world mark in the
440, by the way, is 47.4 seconds.
Eastman, in getting under this time,
had the benefit of a running start,
but it must be remembered that
the 47.4 record was made on a one
turn track, whereas the Stanford
sophomore star ran two turns at
Fresno. It may be said, then, that
Eastman equalled the 440 record
Saturday, a performance that should
convince skeptics, if any such re
main, that he is the greatest middle
distance man in competition today.
It is doubtful that Templeton will
again assail the mile relay record in
the California Intercollegiates, since
his champion team should encounter
little difficulty in defeating the Tro
jan quartet for the third time this
season. This fact will leave Eastman
free to take a shot at the existing
half-mile record in Los Angeles.
Chance of World Work
The 880 record stands at 1 minute
51.G seconds. Eastman's best time to
date in this event is 1:53, which is
fast enough to make any record
! holder fearful for his position on
I the pedestal. The blond Indian flash
has never been really pressed in the
half, and he probably will not be
j pressed Saturday, but we are look
! ing for him to stretch his long legs
in an attempt to bring another world
mark to the Farm.
Captain Podge Smith, who had
symptoms of a muscle cramp at
Fresno, said he felt fine yesterday,
and he will unquestionably add his
name to the latest list of Stanford
point-winners when he gets into the
hurdles at Los Angeles. Arnie West,
foremost of the local broad-jumpers,
who also had muscle trouble at the
Raisin City meet, seems to be in
good shape again. West has been
kept from performing up to his
capabilities all season by injuries,
but with the competition he will be
facing at Los Angeles the 1.C.4-A.
champion may get out around 2-1
feet again.

of the Indian quartet.
Maynor Shove, starting from a
crouch, ran the first 440 yards in
48.8 seconds, passing the baton to
Ike Hablcs, who repeated his team
mate's performance to the tenths of
seconds. Les Hables ran the third
lap in the excellent 440 time of 47.8,
and Ben Eastman stopped the
watches at the finish tape in 47.2.
440-Yard Record
The accepted world mark in the
440, by the way, is 47.4 seconds.
Eastman, in getting under this time,
had the benefit of a running start,
but it must be remembered that
the 47.4 record was made on a one
turn track, whereas the Stanford
sophomore star ran two turns at
Fresno. It may be said, then, that
Eastman equalled the 440 record
Saturday, a performance that should
convince skeptics, if any such re
main, that he is the greatest middle
distance man in competition today.
It is doubtful that Templeton will
again assail the mile relay record in
the California Intercollegiates, since
his champion team should encounter
little difficulty in defeating the Tro
jan quartet for the third time this
season. This fact will leave Eastman
free to take a shot at the existing
half-mile record in Los Angeles.
Chance of World Work
The 880 record stands at 1 minute
51.G seconds. Eastman's best time to
date in this event is 1:53, which is
fast enough to make any record
! holder fearful for his position on
I the pedestal. The blond Indian flash
has never been really pressed in the
half, and he probably will not be
j pressed Saturday, but we are look
! ing for him to stretch his long legs
in an attempt to bring another world
mark to the Farm.
Captain Podge Smith, who had
symptoms of a muscle cramp at
Fresno, said he felt fine yesterday,
and he will unquestionably add his
name to the latest list of Stanford
point-winners when he gets into the
hurdles at Los Angeles. Arnie West,
foremost of the local broad-jumpers,
who also had muscle trouble at the
Raisin City meet, seems to be in
good shape again. West has been
kept from performing up to his
capabilities all season by injuries,
but with the competition he will be
facing at Los Angeles the 1.C.4-A.

While four newly crowned world
champions trotted around in new
track suits, waiting to have their
picture taken, Dink Templeton put
his Indian squad through a light
workout at the Stadium oval yester
day afternoon.
The Stanford track coach does not
plan 011 working his men very hard
this week, in spite of the fact that
the California Intercollegiates are
coming up in the Los Angeles Coli

As another interesting fact on the
record-breaking mile relay at
Fresno Saturday night, about which
Farm fans will talk for clays on end,
now come the individual lap times
of the Indian quartet.
