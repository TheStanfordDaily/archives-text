## Pacific Coast Title To Be At Stake at Eugene On Friday 
### Mike Crofoot 
Stanford's varsity golf team starts
ja long trek Northward this afternoon
I to meet the University of Oregon for
the Pacific Coast intercollegiate team
title. The match is to bo held on
the Webfeet's home course at Eu
gene, Oregon, next Friday.
Victory in the California intercol
| legiate championships April third
j won for the Indians the right to
represent the southern section of
the Pacific Coast conference against
the Northern division winners. Ore
gon is the latter as a result of their
triumph in the Northern tourna
ment last week-end.
Team Members Named
Competition between the Indians
and the Webfeet will probably con-
I sist of 36 hole medal rounds played
| by each member of the six-man
| teams. To the group with the low
j four-man aggregate goes the coast
! crown.
Members of Stanford's team are
j Malcolm MacNaughton, Bud Eichel
! berger, Bob Goldwater, Warner Ed
. monds, Herman Hellman, and Stu
| art Hawley, the first six men on
j the varsity ladder.
I As individual champion of the
i Southern section, Malcolm Mac
j Naughton will meet the Northern
titleholder for the coast singles
j crown. In all probability this will be
j Vince Dolp, defending champion,
j who has always had the Indian sign
j on Mac.
Dolp Oregon Star
Dolp heads Oregon's group of
i crack club swingers. Don Moe, al
i most undisputed ruler of the North
! west golfing realm, is an Oregon
| student, but he is not playing com
j petitive golf this quarter due to his
| heavy course of study.
: Card hopes for a coast crown na
turally soar with this announcement.
! Not that they wouldn't be high any
how, if the Indians' feat of taking
the California intercollegiate title by
j 23 strokes over their nearest rival,
! U.S.C., is any criterion.
