When the great war placed an embargo
on imports from the Central Powers,
American industry found itself deprived
of many necessary products. Among them
the standard asbestos sheet packing then
in general use.
A substitute had to be found. Accord
ingly Crane Co. procured every sheet
packing that could be obtained. Using
the old one as a basis of comparison, not
one was found which could equal its ten
sile strength, compressive strength, or
heat resistance.
So the best American sheet was chosen
and its manufacturer called in. Experi
ment after experiment was made until a
sheet was produced that not only equalled
but surpassed the imported product. It
was named Granite.
The story of Cranite is typical. For 76
years Crane Co. has striven unceasingly
to produce and sell only materials of the
highest quality. When progress calls for
entirely new materials, our engineers are
never satisfied until they have made that
product or that substitute surpassingly
fine. When in practicing the branch of
engineering you are now studying, some
piping problem arises, bring it to Crane
Co. You will find just such co-operation.
