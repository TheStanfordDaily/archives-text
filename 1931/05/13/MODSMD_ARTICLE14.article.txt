## Paris Awaits Presidential Balloting Outcome 
### 
| PARIS, May 12. (/P)—Election
! fever seized France tonight on the
j eve of the gathering of the National
I Assembly at Versailles tomorrow to
! elect the twelfth president of the
j Republic.
The contest appeared to have nar
-1 rowed down to Aristide Briand, G9-
year-old foreign minister and eleven
j times Premier, and Paul Doumer,
President of the Senate.
Police tonight charged a group of
50 Royalist students who were
| demonstrating against Briand in the
i Latin quarter. Five of them were
arrested and others were dispersed.
Socialist Aid Doubtful
In the corridors of the Chamber
; of Deputies, Briand remained the
favorite all day. However, some
! doubt had arisen that he would
i carry the election on the first ballot.
The anti-Briand element has con
-1 centrated around Doumer. This may
] be compensated for by the Socialist
j support, although the Socialists have
1 kept their attitude in doubt.
i The new Chief Executive will
I succeed President Gaston Doumer-
J gue, whose seven-year term expires
June 13.
Claim Duplicity
Briand was reproached by several
I evening newspapers, including the
i conservative Le Temps, for bringing
i an element of combat into the elec
tion by setting himself up against
I Doumer, whose candidacy the for-
I eign minister previously had en
! dorsed.
Briand also was accuscd of being
| the real candidate of the Socialists,
j headed by Leon Blum.
