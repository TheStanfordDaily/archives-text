# HOOVER ASKS TO ABANDON ARMY CAMPS
## Thirty Posts May Be Cut From List; President Seeks Economy 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 (TP).—
President Hoover has appointed a
committee to study the possibility
of using in other government depart
ments twenty or thirty army posts
which he plans to abandon as part
of an economy program in the War
Department.
In addition, President Hoover said
today, some of the posts might be
of "very great value to the .states
for institutional purposes —■ educa
tional or otherwise."
Committee Confers
The committee will represent the
Army, Justice and Agriculture de
partments and the Veterans' Bu
reau.
The action of the president fol
lowed a conference over the week
end at his Rapidan camp with War
Department officials.
Seek Concentrat/on
In making the announcement he
said: "The staff has insisted for
great numbers of years that the
army must be more largely concen
trated if it is to be the most effec
tive body, and it becomes even more
necessary now in view of the very
large mechanization of the army and
number of subsidiary mechanical
services, such as aviation, and so on.

"We have actually abandoned
thirteen posts during the last two
years. The staff will probably report
between twenty or thirty more posts
that should be abandoned if we are
to have the most effective army and
if we are to accomplish some very
considerable economies.'
California Posts
Three of the camps "abandoned"
are in California: Clover Field,
Camp Laurence J. Hearn, and Ross
Field.
Although listed as "abandoned,"
several of the fields are under care
taking establishments or in process
of troop withdrawals.
No expansion of experimental
work is contemplated and no in
creased funds would be needed, he
added.
Attorney General Mitchell said
there was "a chance that one or
more" of the army posts might be
used as Federal prison camps.
