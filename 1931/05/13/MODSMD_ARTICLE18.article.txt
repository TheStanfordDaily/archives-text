# Charge of Subsidization Hurled in Series of 1892
## 
### 
Subsidization, saucer-eyed ogre of
the modern athletic plant, was not
1 altogether absent from the sport
j conflicts of the gay nineties, if we '
I are to believe the crumbling ac- !
' counts of the year 1892, when Stan
' ford went forth to its first athletic ,
i clash with California.
| The presence of several "noil
registered college men" on the Cali- ;
i fornia team, and the "singular bias j
1 of the umpire" prevented Indians i
and Bears from playing the decisive j
i tilt, after each had won one game j
I in the initial baseball series of bay
| history.
Football—the great college builder 1
of (he United States —had offered the
gridiron as scrapping ground for the
stalwart Bear and the slim young
buck Indian. But it appeared that j
the Cardinals, by a careful study of i
Waltpr ('nmn's honk on football, had

developed a system of interference
which the men from Berkeley were
unable to solve, so the Indians gath
! ered in their first scalp 14-10 —the
j first instance of the triumph of the
1 literati over pure brawn.
Without the presence of a "boy
! coach," Stanford seemed not to fare
so well in the first Big Meet, held in
; ihe spring of 1893 on the old Olym
| pic grounds, where the Bears scam-
I pered away with "The Games," 91-
| 35. California even swept the shot
j put, an occurrence which today
j smacks of the mythical, the winning
i toss being 36 feet 10 inches.
1 Tennis matches, during this sec
; ond year of rising athletic antagon
j ism, dealt an irpnic slap at Cali
| fornia, when after losing the first
j four matches, Stanford's lower rank
! itig men took all the remaining tilts
to give the Farm the first scries, 5-4.
