# YES OR YES?

The ballots are cast and counted. Theoretically, the
student body has formally expressed its will, hv indicating
its preferences in the selection of oltice-holders, and its
opinions on the Honor Cod# and the proposed amend
ments to the A.S.S.I', constitution.
Hut in the matter of the constitution amendments, it is
highly doubtful whether any real opinion was expressed in
yesterday's ballotting. At the lop of the ballot headed "Pro
posed Amendments," the lirst proposition was whether
Article .*>, Section 1, Part />, he amended to read: "and one
Freshman man to be elected at the Spring election for the
following year." To a great many of the voters yesterday,
at question meant nothing. Elect one freshman man for
what? No doubt the intelligent voter should have carried
a copy of the A.S.S.I'. constitution with him; then he might
have been aware that the proposal was to secure sopho
more representation on the Executive Committee during
the lirst half of the year. But it is indeed unreasonable to
expect every voter to carry a copy of the constitution. The
election committee should have indicated on the ballot
what was being voted upon.
The second proposed amendment involved a consid
erable change in the section of the constitution covering
time of nominations, and the entire section was printed on
the ballot. A voter could determine by reading the ballot
what he was voting upon. That procedure should have
been followed in the first case.
The third proposed amendment on the ballot had all
the faults of the first. The voter was to decide yes or no on
the "addition of the following phrase to Article 12: 'or in
case of absence, bv the member of the faculty acting as
temporary dean'." Reading the ballot five times could not
convey to the voter what the proposition meant.
And in the fourth case, the election committee fairly
outdid itself in making the ballot meaningless and the
election a farce. That proposition was stated thus:
"I. Article 11, amended to read: 'said petition to con
lain liftv (f)(1) signatures. The vole may be taken at eitlier
a regular or special election of the Association, a majority
vote being necessary for approval of the proposed change'."
.lust what petition? And what association? Hut the big
laugh was in the decision called for from the voters; there
were two little squares, but the answer was YES or YES!
