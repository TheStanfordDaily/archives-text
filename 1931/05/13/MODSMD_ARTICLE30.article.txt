# YOUTH MAY NOT BE SERVED
## 
### 
The matter of stiulont control of intercollegiate ath-
Ictics, a subject which lias been discussed before in The
Dvii.y, is brought to the fore again this month by an article
in Hit' current issue of Ihe I'ovum, written by John R.
Tunis. Tunis, who enjoys the reputation of being a keen
student and analyst of sport, goes on record in favor of
turning the entire problem over to the*students themselves,
thus escaping, he hopes, the wrangling that goes on be
tween universities over athletics.
Tunis bases his argument on the fact that Yale, Harvard,
and Princeon, with three upright and sportsmanlike gen
tlemen at their respective athletic helms, have failed to
keep their institutions on friendly terms. "Why not," asks
Tunis, "permit youth to run its own games and sports with
the decent frankness of youth?"
That is an ideal conception, no doubt, but there is some
doubt as to its praeticablencss. The Pacific (loast has had
its share of athletic squabbles, some of them very, very
recent. What would have been the result if, as Tunis rec
ommends, the directors, graduate managers and their as
sistants had been abolished?
The answer must be obvious. Grunted that youth is
"frank and decent," that an undergraduate manager can
arrange for hotel accommodations for a team without the
assistance of a 10-vcar-old man, what would youth have
done in the ease of the Williams-Hablcs ruckus? There
are no two ways about it; intercollegiate athletics have at
tained proportions too great to allow them to be controlled
by inexperienced students, no matter how well-meaning
tliev mav be.
