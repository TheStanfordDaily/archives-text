lIER DOCTOR LOOKS AT
THE COLLEGE GIRL
By Marguerite M. Marshall
(Condensed from MeCall's
Magazine for June)
Physicians at women's colleges in
the last 10 years have been trans
formed from austere, impersonal
men and women to reasonable, wise
human beings, who besides curing
physical ills, offer understanding
and advice in mental and emotional
problems, too.
The doctors have become the girls'
confidantes. It is they who know the
secret troubles, the hidden heart
aches ,the fleeting fears of the phys
ically robust young women who
crowd college campuses. They see
them as girls in love, lonely young
women, good sports, potential moth
ers. Theirs is the professional view
plus the purely human one.
For the most part, the girls now
at Smith, Wellesley, Vassar, Rad
cliffe, Mount Holyoke, Barnard,
Wells, Hunter, and Bryn Mawr are
very much more human beings to
their doctors than were the students
of years ago. The doctors know
them better.
Intelligence vs. Emotion
The basic reason for emotional
difficulties at college, doctors agree,
is that the college girl's thinking is
more intelligent than her emotions.
Often, even though the girl has rea
soned everything out, she is carried
away by her emotions. But what are
the stumbling blocks that make it
necessary for experts to lend their
; aid? Usually, although couched in
technical language, they are the
simple problems of discipline and
human relationships found among
any group of normal girls.
There is the problem of the girl
who has been spoiled by her fam
ily. Friction with parents can be an
illness, in the new terminology.
These may seem queer aches and
pains to carry to a doctor, but have
n't we all suffered more from them
than from bodily hurts?
Unpopularity Is Problem
Then there is the girl men don't
like. She is the most pathetic pa
tient of all, for no easy remedies
are available, no substitutes ac
cepted. The only treatment is a
thorough analysis of herself.
The most famous emotional mal
adjustment of college girls, the
"crush" of one girl on another,
never has been a serious problem, in
spite of the clouds of gossip con
cerning it, doctors declare. Many
suspected cases of "crush" are really
perfectly natural, although youthful,
stages of emotional development—
the heroine-worshipping idealism
that prompts little girls to bring
, flowers and red apples to their
•teachers. Modern girls usually are
forewarned of the occasional dan
gers, anyhow. They study psychol
ogy and are prepared to deal with
their problems themselves.
But the girls who come to their
campus physicians for emotional
guidance are not the only ones the
doctors see. They examine the well
adjusted students sometime during
1 the year, too.
The Composite Picture
A composite picture of the col
j lege girl shows a figure strong, well
built, fresh of complexion, but rot
necessarily muscular. The college
girl does not overstudy, either. "She
tries to crowd too much of every
thing into what she considers her
four most precious years," explained
Dr. Marjorie Wagoner of Bryn
Mawr.
To protect herself she has grown
a sort of shell. It has become "the
thing" to be sophisticated. Many a
college student strains herself to ap
pear more sophisticated than she
really it, unwilling to admit that she
doesn't know everything.
Part of the college girl's sophisti
cation is her hatred of sentiment.
Mind you, the modern college girl
likes men, plans to marry, and is
eager to have children. She is not
cynical about love, for cynicism, ac
cording to Dr. Jean A. Thompson,
Vassar psychiatrist, is merely a de
fense mechanism for sentimentality.
But she is a realist.
"Why not?" queried Dr. Gulielma
Alsop of Barnard. "The college girl
sees divorce all about her, perhaps
i in the home of her parents. She is
afraid of giving herself away, afraid
to -take the risk of being hurt.
What She Wants
When she plans her life, she goes
into all the details. The Barnard
girl, for example, has decided to
have a family of three. "Because,"
runs the collegiate reasoning, "one
child ought not to be brought up
alone; therefore, I'll have two —and
I might as well have three and be
done with it."
But the typical undergraduate
does not want marriage and mother
hood to be all of life. She wants
either a paid job outside her home
or some other form of independent
personal activity. Getting both these
things is something on which she
has set her heart.
It is all very sane, very sure, very
steady. The college girl is nothing
if not level-headed.
