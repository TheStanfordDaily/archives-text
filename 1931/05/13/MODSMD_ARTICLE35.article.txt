FLAMENCO — By Lady Eleanor
Smith. Bobbs-Meirill. Indianapolis,
1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
The gypsy music that accompanied
the birth of a daughter to Lobo, the
outcast, gypsy murderer, flowed
through Camilla's life, and con
quered her attempts to civilize it.
She had been bought in childhood
by Richard Lovell, the disgraced
Londoner, with two sons, one of
whom Camilla marries, the other
whom she loves. The culminating
events, as they demand the roman
tic ending, are as strains of "flam
enco" melodies.
"Flamenco" is an interesting ro
mance. Its easy style, and excellent
characterizations, especially those of
Camilla's angelic-countenanced but
cowardly weak husband, and her
wild-faced, but strong brother-in
law, in themselves warrant "Flam
enco's" position in the "best-seller"
class. But it is probably the discus
sion of its right to its name that put
it there. —J-N.
ELIZABETH THE QUEEN—At the
Cur ran Theatre.
Arrayed in the splendor of cos

j tume and scenery of Elizabethan |
; fame, blended romantically with his
! Tory, "Elizabeth the Queen" proves
: itself a good play, and with Pauline
Frederick as Elizabeth, and lan
■ Keith as Essex, its fine qualities are
I enhanced until deep pathos becomes
| tragedy—tragedy with no dissenting
sentiment.
Pauline Frederick captures the
] hazy ideas one has of the Elizabeth
! who wanted peace, of her indomi-
I table pride and will, her shrewd
| wit, her passionate love for ambi
j tious, war-loving Essex who realized*
| and told her that should she save
him from death, he would only try
! to wrest her throne from her again.
The last act is a brief dramatic
; masterpiece. Elizabeth and Essex \
j have triumphed over the plots of
Cecil, Burleigh, and Raleigh. But
' between them, ever to turn their
! love to quarrels, is an empire. Max
| well Anderson, author of the play,
1 allows Elizabeth to offer Essex par
don and her kingdom. But Essex
runs through the door to his death,
as the clock strikes, the drums roll,
and Elizabeth literally shrinks and
shrivels. —J-N.
