# Campus Opinion
## OPPORTUNITY; I MAKE OPPORTUNITY 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
i Napoleon said, "Opportunity; I
! make opportunity." "Shrewd schol- ;
I ars" observe the Corsican genius' ;
! success and do likewise. They seize
j opportunity for betterment, both in
| and OUT of class.
On May 7 and 8 I was flattered by j
| the recognition of two "shrewd" '
j scholars" who write authoritatively j
I in Campus Opinion.
; Both men, strangely enough, were
vitally interested in international af
' fairs, and undertook to advise me !
| on such matters at some length. For ;
| this I humbly thank them.
I say both of these "shrewd schol- jars"
| ars" write authoritatively on their \
| subject. They should, for they are
! political scientists, "B" students, and
again, strangely enough, members '
of a class in League of Nations, listed
on the books for five units credit. J
Each Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs
| day, and Friday they meet in this
i League of Nations course, with the
i latter two days reserved for "home
' work and letter writing."
Now when I address Mr. Leonard [
! Effron, San Diego, Calif., self- j
; acknowledged newsboy for the j
j League of Nations, who so gener- j
I ously peddles the Covenant of the
League at five cents per copy and i
even becomes so magnanimous that i
he occasionally gives away a copy to J
the "needy," I do so as one ad
dressing a superior. Thank you, Mr. j
Effron, for your "suggestions" and j
"beliefs." Thank you, too, for re- j
i vealing what you term "my laugh- ,
| able mistake." Thank you for your |
directed reference to Article X of
! the Covenant, which, by the way, in
| some books, is printed in six and
I seven lines.
Unfortunately, you still fail to
point out why the United States can
expect equitable treatment in the
I league court while outnumbered in
the vicinity of 14 to one. Unfortu
nately, you still fail to present a
valid reason for departure from a
time-honored policy that dictates
i our non-participation in foreign en
tanglements. Unfortunately, you still (
fail to explain away the obvious in
competency of our diplomats and
1 legislators to meet European diplo
' mats and legislators on anything ap-
I proaching equal footing.
i In other words, Mr. Effron, you
I favor a government of, by, and for
OTHER people. You favor our en-
I trance into the League of Nations
through the back door—the league
! court. You realize that the votes of
the people in the United States are
but chaff in the wind when it comes
to a showdown against the dollars of
the International bankers, whose
i business makes it profitable to pro
mote international chicanery, inter
national hypocrisy, and finally, in
| ternational wars.
The other gentleman, Mr. Seldon

i Osborne, Mill Valley, Calif., is an
\ other "shrewd scholar." Mr. Osborne
; refers to me as a "bull thrower"—a
! good one at that. For a man in Mr. j
! Osborne's compromising position, I
should say that he was eminently
1 fitted to judge. There is a third
I writer, a Mr. W. A. Roberts of Palo
i Alto, who is sure my thoughts are
I "garbled." Frankness is an admir
! able trait and since Mr. Roberts is
: so unqualified in his characteriza
tion I am moved to add that his let- ;
! ter is somewhat "short-sighted" as j
| the caption writer so thoughtfully j
! labeled it. As to cheapness, Mr. Rob- J
i erts must only remember that his j
| letter was also printed in the Daily j
i and I presume he paid no premium i
for such service.
Sorry, Mr. Roberts, that I have
! offended your super mind with "il
j logical tripe." Nevertheless, I re
! main, with kindest personal regards,
Sincei'ely,
Fred J. Monteagle. j
