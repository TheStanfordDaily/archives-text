## TARIFF ON "IMPORTS" TO AID "500"

BULL SESSlON—tariff on "imports i
It is an accepted American prac- i
lice that when anything is wrong to
set up a tariff to remedy the situa- ,
tion. If the tariff—the only thing in
American politics that men like
Grundy can get emotional over— !
can change this country from a I
shaking province on the rock-bound
coast of New England to the great- j
est, most powerful—in fact the ;
SUPEULATIVE-PLUS nation of the i
world, it is high time that Stanford I
begins to realize the possibilities of j
this wonderful thing.
Now on this campus there is an ;
accepted practice—that is the cus- j
torn vulgarly termed "importing," or j
more properly the tradition of bring
ing non-campus women to campus 1
dances. This is direct discrimination |
against local products. America pro- j
tects American lemons against Ital
ian lemons! Why should not Stanford
protect Stanford women against the
unfair competition of "foreign" spe
cimens? The logic is equally strong
in both cases, And I sincerely favor
[ a tariff for Stanford women.
There is no doubt that they need
I a tariff or some artificial aid. An
| accui'ate census at campus dances
j reveals that the local products are
| outnumbered several fold. While not
I attempting an anlysis of the reason
for this situation, there is no deny

i ing that the condition is present. I
The method to reform the situa
tion is molded along purely ortho- :
, dox Republican lines. It would sim- j
ply consist of charging at the en-
I trance to all campus dances a fee of !
1 about $2 for all non-campus women. I
j If this fee is too small, it could be j
raised higher until foreign competi-
J tion at campus dances would be ab- j
solutely killed. The tariff would |
i probably result in Stanford roughs
being forced to take campus women, ,
as the fee would be so high as to
! defy payment.
All the stock arguments against a
tariff can be presented against this
scheme; but on the other hand all
the stock ax'guments for a tariff can
1 be used to support it. It would bring
j in a revenue, perhaps, to the student
i body from those men who have such
I cxotic tastes that they cannot be
! satisfied by domestic products. The
' argument that it would discriminate
in favor of the women as against
| the men is not valid, for if 300 ten
' der little hearts are bleeding every
| Friday and Saturday nights, the re
mainder of the campus cannot be
happy or contented. Remember we
are all for one and one for all! High
prices for manufacturers mean high
wages for labor; and a happy "500"
means a happy student body.
