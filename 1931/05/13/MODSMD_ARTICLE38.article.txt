So we have some new high-mon
key-monks walking around with
protruding jaws, today. Congratula
tions are in order, aren't they? But
somehow we have an idea that about
as much sympathy ought to go along
with an office on this campus, as
anything else. Anyway we'd try to
, get the A.S. of S.U. to smile sweetly
and answer questions without a
murmur ....

We read in the Daily that nine
new women are sporting Cap
and Gown pins. Cap and Gown,
you understand, is known on
many campuses as an honorary
society for Women who have
made outstanding achievements
during three years of college.
We understand that there was a
heavy rain, on the day election
of the new members took place,
so that a lot of members were
absent. Such an obviously biased
piece of politics couldn't suc
ceed without a reason. Or could
it?

Tonight's the last chance to tango
with your secret sorrow of '31 (pro
viding that you can do that awful
thing). The seniors are staging their
farewell Jolly-Up, with all hands
and feet on deck. Guess that new
women's gym gets a break, all right.
The department is putting all hair
driers under lock and key, to avoid
possible accidents if the roughs hap
pen to want another one. What a
flock of pansies we're getting to be!
Once again, AWS (Associated
| Whoopee Snatchers) to the fore. The
! one really dignified moment of a
; college woman's life, we're told, is
! when she stands at the head of a
} Union dining table and hands over
I the gavel to an incoming president.

I born and not made?

Latest reports from Toyon and .
Branner have it that the in
habitants are slowly being
chewed to death by ants and
(lies. Let's pray for the safety
of the Encina Commons dining
! room. And send for the Flit.
Another little women's organiza
tion, known as Pan-Hellenic in sane

moments, has installed and is all set
to retire again. What would happen
if that gang ever honestly went into
record as having accomplished
something? Success to you!
We pi'omised you an advice-to
the-love-lorn section, and one hope
ful soul in Palo Alto has already
answered the request for questions, j
Read and judge for yourself—and
send yours along by the next mail.
This is a serious piece of business:
"Dear Hester Cabbage: What
shall I do? My teeth recently all
fell out, so I have had to have a
false set made. 1 am afraid the
man I'm going to marry will not
like them. Should 1 tell him
about them now, and risk losing
him, or shall I tell him after
we're married and hope he can't
afford a divorce? Thanking you
in advance, I am, —Lucy G.
Dear Lucy: Marry him and keep i
your mouth shut.

So we have some new high-mon
key-monks walking around with
protruding jaws, today. Congratula
tions are in order, aren't they? But
somehow we have an idea that about
as much sympathy ought to go along
with an office on this campus, as
anything else. Anyway we'd try to
, get the A.S. of S.U. to smile sweetly
and answer questions without a
murmur ....

We read in the Daily that nine
new women are sporting Cap
and Gown pins. Cap and Gown,
you understand, is known on
many campuses as an honorary
society for Women who have
made outstanding achievements
during three years of college.
We understand that there was a
heavy rain, on the day election
of the new members took place,
so that a lot of members were
absent. Such an obviously biased
piece of politics couldn't suc
ceed without a reason. Or could
it?

Tonight's the last chance to tango
with your secret sorrow of '31 (pro
viding that you can do that awful
thing). The seniors are staging their
farewell Jolly-Up, with all hands
and feet on deck. Guess that new
women's gym gets a break, all right.
The department is putting all hair
driers under lock and key, to avoid
possible accidents if the roughs hap
pen to want another one. What a
flock of pansies we're getting to be!
Once again, AWS (Associated
| Whoopee Snatchers) to the fore. The

I the gavel to an incoming president.

Latest reports from Toyon and .

of the Encina Commons dining

Another little women's organiza

moments, has installed and is all set
to retire again. What would happen
if that gang ever honestly went into

something? Success to you!

This is a serious piece of business:
"Dear Hester Cabbage: What
shall I do? My teeth recently all
fell out, so I have had to have a
false set made. 1 am afraid the
man I'm going to marry will not
like them. Should 1 tell him
about them now, and risk losing
him, or shall I tell him after
we're married and hope he can't
afford a divorce? Thanking you
in advance, I am, —Lucy G.
Dear Lucy: Marry him and keep i
your mouth shut.
