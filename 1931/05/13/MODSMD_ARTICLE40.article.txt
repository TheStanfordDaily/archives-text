Track seems to be king sport in
the southern part of the Golden
Slate. At least it is almost on a par
with football in popularity with lans
down L.A. way. And it creates more
interest there, perhaps, than in any
other locality in our fair land. Com
pare conditions anent to track in
Los Angeles with those in the Bay
Region, for example. More south
i rners are willing to lay out a dollar
for a first-class meet, and their
papers devote a lot more space to
the sport than do San Francisco
sheets.
<♦,■
Perhaps this enthusiasm is
caused by the famous Southern
California weather. But what
ever causes the interest, the in
terest causes more athletes to
specialize in the track and field
pastimes, especially high-school
boys. The result is that more
college stars come out of Little
lowa than any other one local -
ity.

In a recent high-school meet down
there, winning times, heights, and
distances read like this: 100-yard
dash, 9.9; furlong, 21.7; quarter
mile, 49.7; half, 1:57; mile, 4:30.1;
high hurdles, 15.9; lows, 24.6; two
mile, 9:58.8; high jump, 6 feet 1 inch;
broad jump, 23 feet inches; pole
vault, 12 feet; and 12-pound shot, 51
feet: 10 inches. There is no reason
why boys who can turn in these per
formances should not keep a steady
flow of Wykoffs, Paddocks, Barneses,
Dyers, etc., coming out of the South.
The University of Southern
California is located on fertile
track soil. A lot of fans who gos
sip about subsidy contributing
to Cromwell's consistent success
in the last few years would do
well to forget the hearsay rea
son and look for something more
concrete as an explanation.
<§> <$• *§>
Another indication that Troy track
power will continue may be found
in the strength of its 1931 yearling
squad. Trojan freshmen took 12
points in Saturday's Fresno affair.
Howard Paul, a brother of Crom
well's star varsity jumper, qualified
in a stellar field while Indian con
testants failed to get into the finals.
Then Paul took a third ahead of i
such men as Kim Dyer and George
Martin of the Winged "O" with a
leap of 23 feet 5% inches! Another
Ked and Gold freshman named Wil
liamson copped a third in the javelin
behind Churchill and DeMers, toss
ing the spear out 194 meet 10 inches.

By way of diversion, we were :
perusing the sports pages of an
Eastern newspaper the other
day, and nothing we found in,
the way of track performances
could disprove the statement
that "the West is best." It must
have been raining on the day
that Princeton met and defeated j
Columbia. Here arc the winning
marks: century, 10.2; 220, 22.2;
quarter-mile, 50 fiat; half-mile,
2:00.8; mile, 4:28.8; two-mile,
9:59.8; high hurdles, 15.6; low
hurdles, 24.1; high jump, 6 feet
3 inches; broad jump, 22 feet 4
inches; and pole vault, 11 feet
(> inches. —Crawford

By way of diversion, we were :
perusing the sports pages of an
Eastern newspaper the other
day, and nothing we found in,
the way of track performances
could disprove the statement
that "the West is best." It must
have been raining on the day
that Princeton met and defeated j
Columbia. Here arc the winning
marks: century, 10.2; 220, 22.2;
quarter-mile, 50 fiat; half-mile,
2:00.8; mile, 4:28.8; two-mile,
9:59.8; high hurdles, 15.6; low
hurdles, 24.1; high jump, 6 feet

inches; and pole vault, 11 feet

Track seems to be king sport in
the southern part of the Golden
Slate. At least it is almost on a par
with football in popularity with lans
down L.A. way. And it creates more
interest there, perhaps, than in any
other locality in our fair land. Com
pare conditions anent to track in
Los Angeles with those in the Bay
Region, for example. More south
i rners are willing to lay out a dollar
for a first-class meet, and their
papers devote a lot more space to
the sport than do San Francisco
sheets.

Perhaps this enthusiasm is
caused by the famous Southern
California weather. But what
ever causes the interest, the in
terest causes more athletes to
specialize in the track and field
pastimes, especially high-school
boys. The result is that more
college stars come out of Little
lowa than any other one local -

In a recent high-school meet down
there, winning times, heights, and
distances read like this: 100-yard
dash, 9.9; furlong, 21.7; quarter
mile, 49.7; half, 1:57; mile, 4:30.1;
high hurdles, 15.9; lows, 24.6; two
mile, 9:58.8; high jump, 6 feet 1 inch;
broad jump, 23 feet inches; pole
vault, 12 feet; and 12-pound shot, 51
feet: 10 inches. There is no reason
why boys who can turn in these per
formances should not keep a steady
flow of Wykoffs, Paddocks, Barneses,
Dyers, etc., coming out of the South.
The University of Southern
California is located on fertile
track soil. A lot of fans who gos
sip about subsidy contributing
to Cromwell's consistent success
in the last few years would do
well to forget the hearsay rea
son and look for something more
concrete as an explanation.

Another indication that Troy track
power will continue may be found
in the strength of its 1931 yearling
squad. Trojan freshmen took 12
points in Saturday's Fresno affair.
Howard Paul, a brother of Crom
well's star varsity jumper, qualified
in a stellar field while Indian con
testants failed to get into the finals.
Then Paul took a third ahead of i
such men as Kim Dyer and George
Martin of the Winged "O" with a
leap of 23 feet 5% inches! Another
Ked and Gold freshman named Wil
liamson copped a third in the javelin
