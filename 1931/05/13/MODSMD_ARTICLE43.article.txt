# HABLES-WILLIAMS 440 DUEL EXPECTED TO BE FEATURE OF LOS ANGELES MEET
## 
### LOWELL COX 
Aside from the fact that "Blazing
Ben" Eastman will probably take a

crack at the world's half-mile rec- i
ord, interest in the California In
tercollegiates Saturday will center in
the 440â€”when Les Hables and Vic
Williams will again meet in the one
lap event.
While arguments still raged as to
who fouled whom in the Stanford-
U.S.C. meet the week before, and
which was really the better runner,
both Hables and Williams stepped
out in the mile relay at Fresno Sat- j
urday night to run their laps in 1
i 47.8 seconds.
This would seem to prove beyond
i doubt that the Indian runner is a j
match for the Trojan ace, and if no 1
disputes arise Saturday about "box- j
ing matches" and fouls, the quarter- j
mile should be the most thrilling
I event of the day.
Dean Cromwell, by the way, has |
recanted on his stand about run
ning the event in lanes. A week ago
he declared that in future meets
with Stanford the quarter-mile I
would be run in lanes or not at all, j
but now has withdrawn his "ulti
] matum."
Another thrill is due in the 220- j
j yard dash, when Frankie Wykolf
j will make his last bid to beat Hec
j Dyer in the event. If dispatches
! from Los Angeles yesterday are to
be taken at face value, Wykoff will
| devote his entire attention to the ;
I century after Saturday's meet, drop- j
i ping the furlong. Cromwell made j
the announcement.
Dink Templeton suggested a week
ago that Wykoff would do better to
i devote his entire attention to the

[shorter racc, for which ho is apply
j ing for an official world record,
i As for team competition Satur
day, the meet will be another In
dian-Trojan duel, with California
and U.C.L.A. bringing up the rear.
Considering the victories of U.S.C.
here and at Fresno, Cromwell's
: forces will probably be favored to
register another win.
Stanford's chances, however, will
be considerably aided by California's
presence in the meet. While having
no chance to win themselves, the
Bears may be the deciding factor in
the meet.
It is expected that the small Ber
keley contingent will cut deeper
! into the Trojans' favorite events than
i into the Indians,' with Churchill
I expected to win the javelin and
Mossman the two-mile.
It is to the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet the
i following week, however, that Tem
j pleton is looking for revenge on the
I Southerners.
