# Card Golfers Vie With Oregon For Title Friday
## WEBFOOTS OFFER POWERFUL TEAM TO FACE INDIANS Six Top Ranking Members Speeding North On Way To Eugene 
### 
It will be Stanford versus the Uni
versity of Oregon for the Pacific
Coast intercollegiate championahip
next Friday.
Six top ranking members of the
Indian golf squad, accompanied by
Coach Garry Bennett and Manager
Wullie Craig, rolled out of the Palo
Alto depot at 4:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, bound for Eugene, Ore
gon, where the match is to take
place.
Arriving there tonight, the team
will have all Thursday to familiarize
themselves with the Eugene Country
Club course and to neutralize to
some extent the Webfooters' advan
tage in playing on their home links.
Malcolm MacNaughton, Bud Eich
elberger, Bob Goldwatei\ Warner
Edmonds, Herman Hellman, and
Stuart Hawley compose the Indian
team. In case they need any intro
duction, they are the same group
which won the California intercol
legiate title for Stanford last April
with a margin of 23 strokes over
U.S.C., second-place team.
MacNaughton was the winner of
the individual title, which carries
with it the right to meet the North
ern champion for the coast crown.
In facing Oregon, the Indians will
be running into their sternest oppo
sition of the whole season. Such
Northwestern stars as George Will
and Vince Dolp are members of ihe
Webfoot team which has swept aside
all opposition to date with great
ease.
Oregon State College was the first
victim, losing to the Webfooters, 1
to 21. Last Friday Oregon whipped
the University of Washington in an
other dual meet, 20 1 /2 to IV2. Over
the week-end they trimmed both
these teams and Montana State to
take the Northern section crown.
