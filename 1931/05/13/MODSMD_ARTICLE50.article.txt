# POLO FOUR PLAYS OREGON STATE IN NORTH TOMORROW
## Veteran Corvallis Squad Is Tough Opposition For Cards 
### 
Stanford poloists will play a vet
j cran Oregon State team when they
j tangle at Corvallis tomorrow in the
| first of a two-game series.
The Northerners, who have prac
tically the same team that played
the Indians last year, are expected
i to furnish tough opposition to the
line-up of the Cards that is new
I this quarter.
Although the loss of men like Me
: Dougall, one of the finest polo play
ers Stanford fans have ever seen in
! action, and Spalding, would leave a
' big gap in any team, the new line-up
: functioned very well against the
I Menlo Circus Club before Fleming
j was injured.
The line-up for the game tomor
row will be as follows: Bruce Flem
ing, No. 1; Pete Lewis, No. 2; Chuck
| Gorham, No. 3; and Pod Boothe, No.
4. Rad Clausen is in the North as
I a substitute.
The present team is very well
balanced and usually plays with fine
j teamwork. All of the players have*
j shown excellent stickwork and are
j experienced horsemen. The Oregon
! Statei - s are in for a tough contest if
i they expect to turn the tables on the
; Cardinals in revenge for Iheir de
l feats* down here last year.
