# LAST SENIOR CLASS JOLLY-UP TONIGHT IN NEW GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
j Establishing a new precedent, the
j senior class will hold its last jolly
j up from 7 to 8 o'clock tonight in
I the Roble Gymnasium.
No more ideal setting could have
been chosen by the outgoing class
for its last get-together. Built with
the plan in mind of providing every
facility necessary for campus dances,
as well as all modern accommoda
tions for physical education classes,
the $225,000 structure will house a
jolly-up for the first time.
Stanford jolly-ups, portraying so
) vividly the unusual atmosphere of
this campus, are one of the lew
traditions which have not gone by
the boards. The Class of '31 on the
eve of its departure is strengthening
that tradition by adding a precedent
that present and future classes
should experience great pleasure in
following.
