# ARMY AIR FORCES TO STAGE DEFENSE OF INDUSTRIAL CITIES; NAVY PRACTICES
## 
### 
DAYTON, Ohio, May 12. (/P) —
Girded for battle, air and sea forces
of the United States were on the
move tonight for war against an
unseen enemy.
While the planes from the Army
Air Corps—more than 650 of'them—
were winging their way toward this
aviation center for a concentrated
defense of industrial centers of the
East and Middle West, the Pacific
Coast battle fleet of the Navy, ac
companied by pursuit and bombing
planes from the aircraft carriers
Saratoga and Lexington, were mov
ing out to sea for a "battle" and
gunnery practice.
Immediately after the entire Army
force is assembled May 15, the avia
tors will inspect maps of the ground
they are to defend and hold. Should
the defense waver, the bombing
planes will be called into action.
All the "destruction" wrought by
the bombers will be theoretical, it
being the duties of umpires and
judges to decide whether the air
forces have accomplished their mis
sions. For the onlooker it will be

only a demonstration of Uncle Sam's
air fighting armada.

' ABOARD U.S. FLAGSHIP CALI
FORNIA, OFF NICHOLAS ISLAND,
May 12. (A s ) —Great guns roared to
, day simulating a terrific naval battle
such as the world has never wit
nessed in actual warfare. Eight su
-1 perdreadnaughts rained tons upon
tons of huge armor-piercing projec
tiles from might turrets upon mov
ing targets ten miles away.
The Secretaray of the Navy,
Charles Francis Adams, witnessed
the titanic demonstration of the
main battle strength of the U.S.
j sea power in the biggest gunnery
; event of the annual fleet force firing
! practice.
I For thirty-three minutes these
j giant fortresses of the sea with their
fourteen- and sixteen-inch guns
! fired broadside at a phantom foe, as
| they sped along at more than
eighteen knots (approximately 20
: miles an hour), zig-zagging to avoid
the dummy torpedoes of a harrass-
I ing fleet of twenty destroyers.
