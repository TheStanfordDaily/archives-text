VERSAILLES, France, May 13 (/P)
Paul Doumcr, white bearded pres
ent of the Senate, tonight was
ected thirteenth President of
ranee, defeating Aristide Briand,
e pre-election favorite.
He won on the second ballot with
•4 votes against 334 for Senator
erre Marraud, a last-minute can
date, but his victory was assured
(jm the first when he polled 442
ites to Briand's 401. The President
France is named at a joint ses
m of the Senate and Chamber of
;>puties.
Briand, repudiated by some on
hose support he had counted,
ithdrew after the first ballot, and
< Socialist support swung to Mar
ud, without giving that candidate
ough strength to threaten the win
•r.
Briand Praised
Premier Pierre Laval gave Dou
er official notice of his election
id the 74-year-old President-elect
sponded briefly with praise for
•iand's foreign policies, and cx
essed hope they would be con
lued.
It was not so certain, however,
at Briand, eleven times Premier
<1 for the last seven years Foreign
inister, would remain in the Cabi
•t. He told his colleagues in the
ternoon he would go to Geneva
morrow for the League of Nations
uncil meeting, as he had planned,
it whether he goes is a matter for
ibinet decision.
Briand's defeat on the first ballot
d been unexpected by most of the
litical experts who had predicted
;it the overwhelming vote by
lich the Chamber sustained his
cign policies last week would be
peatcd in the presidential election.
Tradition Followed
Tradition may have influenced the
,ult to some extent. The presi
ncy of the French Senate is analo
us in many ways to the vice-presi
ncy of the United States. President
•umergue, who continues in office
til June 13, rose to the presidency
mi that post, and others have fol
ved the same path to the Elysce
lace.
