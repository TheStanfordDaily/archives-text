# FRATERNITY COUNCIL TO HOLD ELECTION

### 
Meeting for the purpose of elect
ing officers for the coming year, the
Interfraternity Council will gather
in the Old Union at 8 o'clock tonight
at the request of Bingo Grant, out
going president.
Grant has issued an urgent appeal
for all houses to send representa

the votes of a complete roster of the
local chapters.
