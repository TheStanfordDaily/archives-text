# Results Of Poll On Honor System Show Preference For Code
## Majority State That They Would Not Report a Code Violator and That the System Is a Failure; Carr Elected to Ex Committee 
### 
DELIEVING that the Honor Code is not in successful operation at Stan
ford, that the Honor Code is preferable to the proctor system, and
that the majority of students would not report code violators, is the result
of three of the four questions asked concerning the Honor Code in the
recent elections. In response to the questions, the following results were
tabulated: 1. Do you believe the Honor Code is in successful operation at
Stanford? Yes 601; No 023. 3. Would you report a student whom you
found to have violated the Honor Code? Yes 310; No 842. 4. Under which
system would you prefer to work? Proctor System 282; Honor System 913.

> In answer to the question, Is there
any other system you would prefer
to the Honor Code or proctor sys
tem, a variety of replies were re
ceived. A great many students an
swered the question by saying "No,"
while others suggested the use of
fewer and more comprehensive ex
aminations. Some students went so
far as to advocate the complete abo
lition of examinations as the rem
edy, and others championed the use
of fewer grades, abolishing all marks
except the "A," the plus, and the
minus.
Summing up the responses to this
question, Stewart Stadler, chairman
of the election board, said, "The
gist of the matter is that students
believe there are too many exes
j being given now."

DELIEVING that the Honor Code is not in successful operation at Stan
ford, that the Honor Code is preferable to the proctor system, and
that the majority of students would not report code violators, is the result
of three of the four questions asked concerning the Honor Code in the
recent elections. In response to the questions, the following results were
tabulated: 1. Do you believe the Honor Code is in successful operation at
Stanford? Yes 601; No 023. 3. Would you report a student whom you
found to have violated the Honor Code? Yes 310; No 842. 4. Under which
system would you prefer to work? Proctor System 282; Honor System 913.

> In answer to the question, Is there
any other system you would prefer
to the Honor Code or proctor sys
tem, a variety of replies were re
ceived. A great many students an
swered the question by saying "No,"
while others suggested the use of
fewer and more comprehensive ex
aminations. Some students went so
far as to advocate the complete abo
lition of examinations as the rem
edy, and others championed the use
of fewer grades, abolishing all marks
except the "A," the plus, and the
minus.
Summing up the responses to this
question, Stewart Stadler, chairman
of the election board, said, "The
gist of the matter is that students
believe there are too many exes
j being given now."
