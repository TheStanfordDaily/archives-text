# Stanford Goes Collegiate Humor-Mad Students Mar Class Desks Math Majors Led Astray

### 
Part of the "atmosphere" that j
makes the average campus fertile j
field to scenario-writers of the so- !
called college life—lies in the wood- j
work carvings of Quad classrooms, j
Like the proverbial oak tree by the '
millstream, desk arms offer a wood- :
en monument to receive the roman
tic imprint of the collegiate mind
during its class hours.
Names of Greek letter houses are
universally distributed, phony com
binations outranking the national /
brotherhoods in popularity. Every
desk has its two or three pictorial
replicas of fraternity crests.
Math formulas have an irresistible !
appeal. Math students engrave them '
for future use, whereas to the jour- j
nalist student whose class follows I
in the subsequent hour, the formulas
roll so intriguingly off the pencil
that he adds others of his own in
vention. Needless to suggest the J

j abortive effect this may wreak on a
' mathematics midterm.
Strangely enough, full names have
j been avoided by the generations of
j class-room chronica lists. Nicknames,
: initials, and class numerals run ram
! pant. Socrates, Pulitzer, Leland
Stanford Jr., and profanity in eight
languages are cut into the wood
within four seats of each other.
Since the rise of Hoover to nation
al eminence, no less than 72 varin
l' tions of "Herb Hoover "95" have
I been cut into the seats by would-be
antiquary. An occasional arrow
! pierced heart is not lacking, though
its spirit is obviously ironical.
The campus wine-list, however,
j gets the first award. Spreading from
I desk to desk through the rooms of
the Inner Quad, it has reached a
span of 23 rare wines, and other
licquers, ranging from bacardi to
J white mule.
