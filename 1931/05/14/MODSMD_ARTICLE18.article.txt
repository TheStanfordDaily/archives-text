The list of sponsors to advise the
freshman women entering Stanford

Acting-President Robert E. Swain,
following their selection by the new
Women's Council.
Barbara Beach Thompson was
named head sponsor. Other women
chosen as sponsors for next year
are: Ann Adams, Beatrice Clyne,
Shirley Harcourt, Catherine Har
wood, Beth Pillsbury, Miriam
Strout, and Louise Taft. They will
assume their new duties the first
of autumn quarter.
Barbara Boggs, newly elected
president of the Associated Women
I Students, will be an ex-officio spon
sor, and Katherine Maus, who was
elected President of Roble Club
Tuesday night, will also serve in an
ex-officio sponsor capacity.
Duties of the sponsors include
aiding the entering women with
registration, and assisting their ori
entation to Stanford life during their
first quarter in the University. This
past year the sponsors remained in
Roble for two quarters, but it has
not been decided whether the group
will continue this precedent next
year.
Outgoing sponsors submit a list
of women who are recommended for
sponsorial positions for the next
year. The list is discussed by mem

cil, the final group being selected by
the new Council. This list must be
approved by Dean Mary Yost and
President Swain.
