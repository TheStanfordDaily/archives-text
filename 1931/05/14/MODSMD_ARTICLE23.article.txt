DRE-MEI) students arc the
most stable, and economics
majors the flightiest, C. Gilbert
Wrenn, vocational guidance di
rector here, revealed yesterday
with curious facts about ma
jors who follow their subjects
after graduation.
The M.D.'s come first, it
seems, because they know what
their responsibility implies be
fore shouldering it, whereas
economics majors are for the
most part a diverse crew who
arc hazy as to the best pursuit
after college.
Science majors. Wrenn said,
usually continue their work
after graduation, but the
branches in which they special
ize arc likely to be switchedâ€”
an organic enthusiast finding
himself a niche in the inorganic
field, or a "mech eng" practic
ing in the outside world as an
electrical engineer. After grad
uation, declared Wrenn, a
man's major depends on the job
he can land.
