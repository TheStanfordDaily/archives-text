# EASTMAN WILL ENTER QUARTER MILE SATURDAY
## Star Middle Distance Man Added to Feature Race In Los Angeles HABLES ALSO ENTERED Ben Scheduled To Run Two Lap Event In South 
### Lowell Cox 
| More thrills are promised for the
quarter-mile at Los Angeles Satur
day.
With track fans already looking to
the Les Hables- Vic Williams duel
as the feature of the California In
j tercollegiates, Dink Templeton in
dicated yesterday that none other
than "Blazing Ben" Eastman will
enter the event.
Just prior to the U.S.C. meet
bleacher coaches were talking about
what a race it would be when Wil
liams and Eastman met. Templeton
kept his "blond hope" out of the
event, but lap times at the Fresno
relays indicated that Eastman is
without doubt the better man.
Eastman Should Win
While Ben is expected to win the
event with ease, the Hables-Wil
liams matter will lose little of its
flavor. Hables has been looking for
ward to Saturday's met ever since
the Trojan dual meet, and has sworn
Williams will not finish ahead of
him. So it may be that friend Vie
will steam in in third place.
, Meanwhile Eastman will also en
ter the half-mile, and there is still
the possibility that he will crack
the world's record, although the
other race may tend to slow him up.
The question as to whether Ben will
run the relay will not be decided
| until today.
