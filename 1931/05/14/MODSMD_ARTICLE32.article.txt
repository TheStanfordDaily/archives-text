# MEANING WHAT?

Four questions were asked the Assoeiated Students yes
terday the Honor ('ode. Puzzling, but expected,
answers were given.
First, the voters were asked: Do you believe the Honor
(lode is in success fill operation at Stanford? Opinion was
slightly in the negative, (121 answering no and <>01 saying
yes. The question was a hard one to answer, in that il was
open to a variety of interpretations. There is no doubt that
the Honor (lode does not operate as successfully as il
should, but there is also little question that il is not a com
plete failure. The results reveal an uncertainty on the part
of the student body as to just what is meant by "successful
operation."
To question two—ls there any other system you would
prefer to the Honor (lode or the proctor system?—there
were a variety of answers. Some wanted an abolition of
the grading system; others asked for comprehensive ex
aminations only. But the only other system than the two
named which was suggested was that of an ideal honor
situation, where there would be no instruments of enforce
ment whatever. This seems to be a l lopian dream, impos
sible of realization.
The students were next asked which system they would
prefer, the Honor (lode or the proctor system. The ballot
ing strongly favored the Honor (lode, Dili votes to 282. The
final question—Would you report a student whom you
found to have violated the Honor (lode? —received a nega
tive response, <SI2 saying no, and only 310 answering af
firmatively.
Rather a curious set of results! The Associated Stu
dents, a majority of them at least, believe the Honor (lode
is not in successful operation at Stanford. They prefer the
Honor (lode to the proctor system and propose no other
feasible plan of regulating academic conduct. Yet they are
unwilling to report student violators of the Code.
This leaves the Associated Students two means of mak
ing the Honor (lode work. The first is by observing all the
provisions of the (lode themselves, and the second is by
paying more attention twice yearly to the election of coun
cils which will enforce the Code and punish severely all
convicted violators.
The first is the individual responsibility of every stu
dent. The second is the responsibility of not only all the
students, but more particularly of the men and women
elected to the councils. It is their duty to enforce the (lode
vigorously and fairly. They can deserve their offices in
no other wav.

The students were next asked which system they would
prefer, the Honor (lode or the proctor system. The ballot
ing strongly favored the Honor (lode, Dili votes to 282. The
final question—Would you report a student whom you
found to have violated the Honor (lode? —received a nega
tive response, <SI2 saying no, and only 310 answering af
firmatively.
Rather a curious set of results! The Associated Stu
dents, a majority of them at least, believe the Honor (lode
is not in successful operation at Stanford. They prefer the
Honor (lode to the proctor system and propose no other
feasible plan of regulating academic conduct. Yet they are
unwilling to report student violators of the Code.
This leaves the Associated Students two means of mak
ing the Honor (lode work. The first is by observing all the
provisions of the (lode themselves, and the second is by
paying more attention twice yearly to the election of coun
cils which will enforce the Code and punish severely all
convicted violators.
The first is the individual responsibility of every stu
dent. The second is the responsibility of not only all the
students, but more particularly of the men and women
elected to the councils. It is their duty to enforce the (lode
vigorously and fairly. They can deserve their offices in
no other wav.
Four questions were asked the Assoeiated Students yes
terday the Honor ('ode. Puzzling, but expected,
answers were given.
First, the voters were asked: Do you believe the Honor
(lode is in success fill operation at Stanford? Opinion was
slightly in the negative, (121 answering no and <>01 saying
yes. The question was a hard one to answer, in that il was
open to a variety of interpretations. There is no doubt that
the Honor (lode does not operate as successfully as il
should, but there is also little question that il is not a com
plete failure. The results reveal an uncertainty on the part
of the student body as to just what is meant by "successful
operation."
To question two—ls there any other system you would
prefer to the Honor (lode or the proctor system?—there
were a variety of answers. Some wanted an abolition of
the grading system; others asked for comprehensive ex
aminations only. But the only other system than the two
named which was suggested was that of an ideal honor
situation, where there would be no instruments of enforce
ment whatever. This seems to be a l lopian dream, impos
sible of realization.
