## 
### 
Front Yale University, which in February announced a
revised eurrieular plan effective next fall, conies the news
that tlie requirement of Latin and Greek for the Bachelor
of Arts degree has been abolished. This would not he news
from most institutions, but Yale has long been regarded
as the stronghold of classicism. The present instance is a
slc|> toward a more modern educational program.
Under Yale's new eurrieular plan, each undergraduate
will take only 20 courses in his four years in college. He
will not he required to take Latin or Greek, and his only
examinations will he comprehensive ones at the end of
each year.
The attitude of Yale toward its students was expressed
last week by Dean Clarence "NY. Mendell, of Yale College:
"We are limiting the men in the number of courses that
they may take, enlarging to a certain degree each course
hv throwing more emphasis on the independent work of
the individual. We are trying to lead the boy to realize
that whatever he gets permanently he must dig out for
himself and make his own. The faculty through lectures
and recitations may help him, I>nl they cannot do the real
work for him. He must meet examinations in the strength
of work he has done himself, and these examinations are
to he the lest of his accomplishments.
"We are eliminating small and fragmentary courses
and are making the examinations cover the work of a
whole year. At the same time we are making it possible
for Ihe better men to do a great deal more advanced work
and to correlate their work much better. For the men who
are not so good we are trying to direct their work in such
:i way that they will get the best results that they are ca
pable of obtaining."
That is a constructive educational altitude.
