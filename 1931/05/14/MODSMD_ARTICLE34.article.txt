# BULL SESSION
## THE 						COOLIDGE MYTH MIGHT DEFEAT HOOVER 
### 
Very few people outside ' of a
young and very hopeful wing of the
Democratic Party are positive that
Herbert Hoover will publish a book
in 1932 entitled "Ex-President."
There is, however, enough evidence
to convince conservative members
of both parties that the typical Re
publican landslide will probably be
little more than a cloud of dust —
and the Democrats might even
squeeze through with victory.
If Hoover is defeated, however, it
will to a large extent be due to ihe
"Coolidge Myth"—whose golden out
lines, though hazy because of bril
liance, do nevertheless remain with
the people as something genuine.
Hoover followed Coolidge, and it is
only natural that he should be com
pared with his predecessor. The
comparison is hard on Hoover be
cause only a glorified and largely
false picture remains of Cal.
During the reign of the Great God
of Economy (nee Calvin Coolidge),
there were great surpluses in the
treasury. Why were they there?
Coolidge was economical. The rea
soning is simple and obvious. Now,
however, the administration is in
the hole over $900,000,000 with
Democratic forecasts that the deficit
will break $1,000,000,000 before the
election—if not sooner. The fact that
both the surplus at one time and
the deficit at the next may be due
largely to the size of the income tax
returns (over which the President
has little control) does not enter the
practical situation. The fact remains
that if Coolidge economy caused

J surpluses before; Hoover inefficiency
! must be causing deficits now. Dur
ing prosperity, Andrew Mellon was
: termed the "greatest Secretary of
the Treasury since Alexander Ham
ilton"; and yet the same man will
soon be dubbed "The greatest Secre
tary of the Treasury since the Wil
son administration."
i Then, also, with Coolidge is as
i sociated prosperity. The people had
the notion that at the head of the
government was a cool, silent man
j who so managed things that pros
i perity was inevitable. On the con
! trary, with Hoover is associated
{ whatever economic situation we are
j now in. Most people call it depres
| sion although others like to term it
| a necessary transition between two
j high levels of prosperity. The fact
' remains, whichever explanation one
chooses, Hoover was caught be
tween the peaks of the business
! cycle and as a result is blamed for
a depression, just as his predecessor
jin office was '"blamed" for pros
j perity. Economics aided the Repub
■ licans once, and has now turned its
| smiling face on the Democrats.
Whether the ti'adition of Hoover,
| the engineer, will be strong enough
j to overcome the myth of Coolidge,
i the "economist"; whether the fiction
t of Republican prosperity will be
| strong enough to overcome the talk
j of Hoover depression is as yet not
1 certain enough for positive state
! ment. Both sides have justification
i in hoping, which is a strange situa
j tion in a country where Democrats
usually hope—but without justifica
tion. —Abe Mellinkoff.
