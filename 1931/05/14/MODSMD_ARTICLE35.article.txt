THE MILLIONAIRE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
George Arliss' modern character
ization is as worthy of praise as his
older Disraeli, and Heythorpe of
"Old English."
As a wealthy man in ill-health, he
experiments with the life lived by
working men of moderate income,
opens a gas-station, and introduces
his daughter to his assistant.
Perhaps because Arliss has played
two Victorian roles, outstanding
enough to instil him in our minds as
contemporary to the originals them
selves, the change to a present-day
American business character dashes
our illusions a bit. The story does
not reach the standard of John Gals
worthy's, of .course, but has as a
balancing attribute, that thing that
we can but call charm. —J.N.
THE FINGER POINTS—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Richard Barthelmess comes from
the South full of virtues and ideals
to work on a paper in the great big,

I cruel city. After a promising start
! it takes the city just six weeks to
| ruin him despite the pleadings of
1 Fay Wray, in the part of a very un
i convincing woman reporter.
"The Finger Points" is just an
other gang picture with the press
doing its best to wipe out "public
I enemies." The whole plot seems to
be written about the life and death
iof the late-lamented Jake Lingle.
' Certain out-of-character bits indi
cate that the directors and their as
sistants had never been inside the
j city room of a real newspaper nor
hob-nobbed with a real gangster.
Hollywood never fails to suggest,
j delicately, of course, the unconven
tional love element and yet come out
of it with all flags flying and the
Young Girl's Protective League huz
| loudly and casting the rose
petals of their approval in its path,
and in the sequence with the inno
cent Dick staying in the lady re
porter's room all night it has done
what is undeniably its best job in this
