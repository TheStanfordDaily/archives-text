# Cabbages and Things
## 
### 
poor old cabbages sing a dirge for i
him he was such a nice cabbages too !
but a speeding thought struck him
in midair yesterday afternoon with j
the result that he went around say
ing all the worlds green cheese and |
most of us are awfully mouldy well |
you can easily see that that couldn't
be allowed to go on

so they took the poor old boy
to the dog and cat hospital where
hes rapidly declining such a
cheerful chap too
and as usual some other sons of J
the red are tearing up the turf up
in oregon not bothering much to 1
even replace divots according to a J
direct communication one of the <
boys sent to the daily it is strange i
he said to note the striking similari
ties of oregon horses and California j
horses why the native horses whinny j
and neigh and that is a strange sight '
to see i've always wanted to travel j
to see strange things but it will seem
good to laugh at the 500 again

t oh dear oh dear what are we going
| to do if the weather doesnt stabilize
|4tself we can't afford to be thorough
ly. Caucasian during a whole summer
i and looking like mulattos put on in
pieces doesnt exactly appeal death
I where is thy sting and geologists
I where your earthquake the world is
dying from inactivity theyve buried
I us for instance from the chin up and
keep track of our condition with a
thermometer which of course is uri
! fair its always cooler in the shade

the original cabbages being out
of the way we cant find the keys
to the box of love lorn letters so
cant answer any today
however we thought you might
like a new little ditty home grown
on the grid iron its called the arctic
song you know
it was only a BYRD or a brrrd
in a gilded cage its going to be
revised soon
thank you kindly and hope for the
best we cant afford more than cow
slips for the funeral right now and
thats low in the animal kingdom
