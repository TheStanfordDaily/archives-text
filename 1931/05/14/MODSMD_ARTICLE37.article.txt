## WE HAVE LEARNED OF WAR'S HORRORS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In reply to Adolph Muller, '32,
who wants to enlist the aid of mili
tary students to combat the "evil"
propaganda of the Women's Peace
Leagueâ€”Dear Adolph, 1 fear you
have really appealed to the wrong
parties for your campaign. We of
the military department are even
greater pacifists than are those you
wish to combat. Really.
Wo student officers have shot forth
tons of flying shrapnel and realize
what horrors war can have. We have
bull-sessioned around campfires
man to man with our Officer-Pro
fessors and have learned what an

I inhuman thing war is.
If you were ever to take the mili
tary course, Adolph, you'd see that
i we're not apple-polishing students
! fauning at the feet of our officers,
too weak-willed to say what we
wish. Grades are never affected by
honest opinion. 1
As a student officer, I thank you
for your regard of intelligent mili
tary preparedness as a factor for
world peace. But the Women's Peace
League is another way of working
for the same end. Why be so bitter
against them? You don't have to
take a bite out of a trench to get
trench mouth.
Ralph Thomas Lui, '31
