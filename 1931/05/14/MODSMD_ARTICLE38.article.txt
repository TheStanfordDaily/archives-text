# FLAGRANT AND HARSH PUBLIC CRITICISM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir-
It has always been the general
assumption that a university is an
institution whose ideals are to pro
mote the constructive development
of the individual.
Are college politics of sufficient
importance to warrant such a radical
deviation from Ihese principles as
the malicious attack on a candidate
in the recent election by an or
ganization which is supposedly non

! partisan in student competitions?
This student had already been dealt
'with according to the decision of the
| representatives of the student body.
It would seem that such a flagrant
,and harsh public criticism would de
stroy all incentive for r'econstruc
; tion.
The principle aim of all punish
ment should be to build up rather
! than to break down the future po
tentialities of the offender.
