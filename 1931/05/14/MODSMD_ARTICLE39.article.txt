MISCELLANEOUS
I Men now living in Toyon and Bran
ner halls who wish to reserve
rooms for fall quarter should call
at the Dean of Men's office Mon
day or Tuesday, May 11 or 12, and
pay their deposits. Room draw
ings will be held at 7:30 p.m., on
Wednesday, May 13, in the of

! Union, Sequoia, and Encina men
who wish rooms for fall quarter
j should call at the Dean of Men's
office Thursday or Friday to make
reservations.
Personal honor is something so
: delicate and tangible that it is an
j utter impossibility for any outsider
j to make a critical judgment of an
; other's character. One who attempts
to do so merely flaunts a distorted
sense of human values.
Sincerely,
Margaret Weaver
