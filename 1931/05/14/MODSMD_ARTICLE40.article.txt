## LOOKING EAST 
### 
The 1.C.4-A. classic in Philadel
phia this year will be marked by a
titanic struggle between Yale and
Pennsylvania track stars—for third
place honors. Stanford and Southern
California are perfectly justified in
their confidence that first and sec
ond places are coming to the Far
West again this season, but there is
a common mistaken idea out here
that the 1.C.4-A. will simply be an
other duel between the Indians and
the Trojans.
The East has good track men—
plenty of them, hut not enough
;.re gathered 011 any one 1931
team to threaten the supremacy
of the West. Yale and Pennsyl
vania come (lie closest, with
Pcnn having a slight paper edge.
These two should manage to
amass more points than their
chief rivals, Penn State and
Harvard, in the East, and Cali
fornia.

First of all, Penn has the redoubt
able Barney Bellinger, whose name
is a synonym for "all-around ath
lete" in national circles. Berlinger is
the Bob Hall or Harlow Rothert of
the East, and he ranks as the fore
most shot-putter back there at 48
feet G inches, a mark which will win
points at Philadelphia. His team
mate, Fred Steiner, throws the dis
cus J.49'9%." Lamoine Boyle has
jumped 24'3y4" this season. He
placed third in the 1.C.4-A. broad
jump last year behind West of Stan
ford and Barber of S.C.
Pennsylvania also lias a quar
ter-miler, one Horace Steel, who
won the 440 against Yale in 4S.S,
and who is anchor man on
Penn's mile relay team which
won the Penn Relays in the time
of .'5:18. Dan Dean is no slouch
in the two-mile, having run 9:47
against Yale on May 2. The mile
is a bright spot on the Red and
Blue squad. Carl Coan ran 4:13
to defeat the great Ray Conger
of lowa State indoors last win
ter, and Bill McNiff usually
noses out Coan at Penn track
practices.

So much for Penn—take a look at
Ihe Eli roster. Frank Conner is a
cinch to win the 1.C.4-A. hammer
throw. He is the present champion,
and tosses the weight .163 feet. Stan
ford and S.C. don't think much of
the hammer-throw, but there it is,
and it's worth the usual 15 pojnts in
the 1.C.4-A.
Harold Fates won the low
hurdles for Yale against Penn
sylvania in 23.8, a good time any
time or place, lie took the cen-
