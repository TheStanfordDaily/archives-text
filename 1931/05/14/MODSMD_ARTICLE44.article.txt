# NEW POLO LINE-UP TO GET REAL TEST IN BEAVER CLASHES
## 
### 
Stanford and Oregon State polo
fours clash today at Corvallis in a
game that should finally decide the
strength of the new Indian line-up
against a veteran team.
The Northerners are putting prac
tically the same outfit on the field
that played down here a year ago,
and wiili their experience they have
gained they are expected to give
the Indians much tougher opposi
tion.
The Stanford poloists will have
the disadvantage of being mounted
on the unfamiliar Oregon State
ponies, as well as that of playing on
a strange field.
The present Cardinal team has not
as yet had much of a trial in out
side competition, but functioned very
well in the early part of the Menlo
Circus Club game before Fleming,
at No. 1, was hurt.
The Stanford line-up today will
be: Fleming, No. 1, Lewis, No. 2,
Gorham, No. 3, Boothe, back, Clau
sen, substitute.
