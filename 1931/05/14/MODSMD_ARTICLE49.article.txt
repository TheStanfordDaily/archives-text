## 
### 
With the Pacific Coast intercolle
giate golfing title as the spoils,
I Stanford will seek victory over the
[ University of, Oregon's crack goli
| team tomorrow at Eugene.
Arriving there last night, the In-
I dian team will spend today in get
| ting acqua'.nted with the links of the
! Eugene Country Club, where the
| match is to be played. Members of
j the team are Malcolm MacNaugh
! ton, Harry Eichelberger, Bob Gold
, water, Warner Edmonds, Herman
■ Hellman, and Stuart Hawley.
Among the members of their team
| is Vince Dolp, present coast cham

j pion. And he is not even the num
j ber one man. A certain George Will
j holds the premier position for the
Webfoots. His (JB's in recent dual
meet victories over the Washington
teams show why.
Chief threat to an Indian triumph
is Don Moe, undisputed ruler of the
Northwest golfing realm. Because of
.school work, he has not had time to
play golf much this spring and it
was recently announced that he
would not compete against the In
dians. But it is likely that he can
and will take a day's vacation from
studies if a Pacific Coast crown is
at stake.
