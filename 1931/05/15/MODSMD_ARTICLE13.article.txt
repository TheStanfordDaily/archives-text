### 
Men's rushing during the past sea
j son was made the center of a storm
[ of criticism at the meeting of the
; Intel-fraternity Council last night, at
; which Warren Biggs was elected to
1 succeed Richard Grant as president
! for the ensuing year.

fore surrendering the chair by af-
I firming that the operation of the
i rushing rules this year has been
ridiculous, and suggesting that ac
i tion be taken immediately to cor
-1 rect the situation.

"There might as well have been
j no rules this year," said Grant, "in
; view of the manner in which fra
ternities ignored them. Men's rush
ing has become a farce which brings
discredit on the Interfraternity
| Council and every house on the
campus."
Grant suggested either a modfica
tion of the present rules or another
trial of a "gentlemen's agreement"
among the houses to observe the
regulations. As modification meas
t ures, he brought up the possibility
| of granting a limited number of off
campus rushing dates to fraternities,
a change which would be subject
to the approval of the University
administration and the Interfrater
nity Board of Control.
"Immediate action should be taken
to prevent the recurrence of a rush
ing fiasco such as the campus wit
nessed this year," concluded the re
tiring president.
Change in Rules
Biggs, upon taking the chair, fol
' lowed Grant's suggestion and that
of others who participated in the
! debate by appointing a committee
to draw up and present to the board
|of control recommendations for a
change in the present rushing sys
i tem. Those named were Louis
Moore, Wayne Elwod, and Paul
I Burks.
Other officers elected at the meet
i ing were John Deuel, secretary, suc
i ceeding Norman McLeod; Ward
Woods and Larry Harris, student
representatives on the Interfrater
: nity Board of Control. They suc
! ceed George Eastman and Herbert
I Hazeltine, who have served on the
| board this year.
