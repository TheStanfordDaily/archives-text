# Eat, Drink, Be Merry? Psych Rats Questioned
## 
### 
Food, water, or sex—which of
these constitutes the most important
drive in life? This is the problem to
be solved for humanity by more
than an thousand Stanford rats.
Located in comfortable cages in
the attic of the Psychology building,
expanding families of rodents are
awaiting their turns to serve science.
Rats of every description—fat and
thin rats, genius rats and morons,
plus gifted ratlet progeny—spend
their days cramming for the psy
chology tests.
Pied Piper
Stanford's Pied Piper, in the dis
guise of Michael Tomilin, Russian
student, spends most of his time
caring for the rats. Their scientific
diet is composed of bran mixed with
certain invigorating chemicals. Once
a month they are scrubbed and
slicked down with pomade, whence
their trim appearance.
The simple rat shall lead the
learned scientist to his goal. Each
rodent martyr to modern research

progress is locked in a cage, de
prived of food, water, and the nor
mal advantages of community life;
then, with the observer on hand
with poised pencil and stopwatch,
the cage doors are opened to see
which way he will scamper, driven
by which drive.
Isolation Tests
The story of "The Lady or the
Tiger" ranks feebly with this proc
ess for drama, and suspense. The
isolation test proceeds from group to
group of different ages, to find if age
is what determines a.young man's
fancy—the supposition being that it
proves concurrent with the young
rat's.
This is not the only project which
interests the rats at present. The
local campus rat must work for his
living. This spring the psychologists
are trying out a new rat intelli
gence testing scheme.
A glorified version of the Three
Blind Mice, synthetically blinded,
are learning to traverse the maze in
darkness.
