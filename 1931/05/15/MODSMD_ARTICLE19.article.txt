peace and credit have been respons
ible for the anti-clerical riots of the
past three days, Provisional Presi
dent Niceto Alcala Zamora told for
eign newspapermen tonight, in his
first interview since the outbreak of
the riots three days ago.
The President received the foreign

$50,000,000 Damage Toll
Unofficial estimates placed the to
tal of religious institutions burned
to the ground, sacked, or damaged
by fire at sixty-five and the prop

000. To escape mob fury, hundreds
of clerics fled the country, among

President Zamora declared that
the republic is now prepared to
maintain order by force if neces
sary. He declined to comment on

although he said:
"It is likely that Alfonso was con

tion."
Seek King's Trial
He also declined to elaborate on
Attorney General Gallarza's an
nouncement that the former mon
arch's extradition from France
would be sought so that he could
be tried for his alleged part in in
spiring the disorders.
The outbreak of the riots was due
to the "coincidence" that both
Monarchists and Communists simul
taneously began agitating
the republic, stated the President,
adding that some provincial authori
ties were remiss in dealing with the
situation.
