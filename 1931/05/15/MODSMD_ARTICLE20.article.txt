# CARD TRIO UPHOLDS HONORS IN COUNTY NET TITLE GAMES
## 
### 
Three men from the Indian
stronghold will resume play at the
San Jose Tennis Club tomorrow and
Sunday. All that remains of the
original nine entered in the senior
Santa Clara County tournament,
this trio will make a strong bid for
championship honors.

Harry Plymire, Chuck Weesner,
and Dan Ellis are the three Stanford
hopes. Plymire is seeded number
one, but has a tough barrier to pass
in the person of Larry Hall, former
Indian team captain. Hall is almost
certain to win the tournament if he
downs Plymire in their semi-final
match.

Both of the other semi-final
brackets are already filled, assuring
a battle between Chuck Weesner,
out of competition this year but
ranked number seven on the varsity
ladder, and Dan Ellis, third fresh
man. Weesner defeated Petterson
to gain the semi-finals, and Ellis
took down Blethen, who had previ
ously won over Niederauer, seeded
number two.
Al Bogan, fifth ranking freshman,
will continue play from the semi
final round of the junior tourna
ment, which he gained last week
end. Rca will be across the net from
him Saturday. He is also in the
semi-finals of the doubles tourna
ment, paired with Buckley.
