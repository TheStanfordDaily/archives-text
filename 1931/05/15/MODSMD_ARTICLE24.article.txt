# Shatford Makes Plea For Peace In Speech Here
## Disarmament Advocated by Canadian Rector 
### 
There are five main gorges cleav
ing humanity which must be over
i come before the invisible interna
tional bridge of reconciliation and
, peace can be built, declared the
Reverend Allan Pearson Shatford
; of Montreal, speaking at the Uni
versity assembly yesterday morn
! ing. The five chasms to be spanned
j are excessive nationalism, color pre
judice, class superiority, religious
intolerance, and intellectual stagna-
I tion.
The speaker, emphasized the in
terdependence of nations. He
stressed the fact that, since the Pa
; cific is rapidly becoming the theatre
of the world, it is the duty of the
nations bordering this ocean to begin
"to build the bridge of reconcila
i tion."
"I believe that the only real se
curity is in disarmament," Reverend
j Shatford stated. "If there had been
forts along the boundary between
Canada and the United States, there
would have been war."
What we need particularly today
are international, inter-color, inter-
I class, inter-religious interpreters —

people who can see things in the
terms of the whole and the best,
said the Canadian lecturer. Too of
ten we interpret in the terms of
the worst.

This imaginary bridge, the speak
er concluded, must be started from
both banks—the nations at each end
must add their part to its construc
tion. It cannot be built without sac
lifice of such things as pride. It must
be wide enough so that it is not a
one-way thoroughfare. It must be
a free bridge, not a toll bridge.
There should be no walls—arma
ments, steep customs regulations—
at either end to engender hatred.
And finally, it must be an enduring
bridge.
The lecturer was introduced by
Professor William B. o>vens of the
Department of Law.
