# Card Trackmen Board Lark For Southern Clash
## California, U.C.L.A., and S.C. Teams Enter Competition For Coast Intercollegiate Title! Card Chance Slight to Avenge Troy Victories TWO CONSISTENT WINNERS ON INJURED LIST Bear Points May Cut Into Trojan Scoring Machine; Captain Smith's Entry Still Undecided 
### FRITZ GOODWIN 
ANOTHER crack at the heretofore invincible Trojans was the chief ob
jective of Dink 'lempleton and some 27 of his Indian track squad last
night, as they entrained on the Lark for Los Angeles and tomorrow'*
California Intercollegiates. Teams from California and U.C.L.A., besides
Stanford and S.C., will be gathered within the Coliseum, but aside from
the color of their uniforms they are expected to add little to the annual
intercollegiate alVair. With at least two of Stanford's consistent point
winners on the injured list, chances are not very strong that the Farm
athletes will be able to avenge their defeats by Troy at the dual meet
and the Fresno relays. Whether Captain Podge Smith, who has been held

! out of practice by a troublesome leg
1 muscle, would enter the hurdles in
Los Angeles was still undetermined
last night.

Lomhardi Out
Frank Lombardi, sprinter, is un
able to compete because of troublr
with his arches. Fred Zuger, who
showed promise of becoming a con
sistent 200-foot javelin thrower early
in the season, has been kept out of
all the meets by a sprained back.
Podge Smith's probable absence
from the Indian line-up will leave
the hurdling burden on the shoul
ders of Nisbet and Brugman. Nisbet
was good for a brace of seconds in
i the Trojan dual meet and should be
I able to collect the same six points
! tomorrow. Brugman broke into the
j scoring column against S.C. in the
1 highs at Fresno.

Bears Will Help

Stanford has considerably more
than an outside chance against llir
Red and Gold tomorrow because of
the entrance of the Berkeley team.
For once, it seems that the Bears
may do the Indians a real favor, by
entering Ken Churchill, Spud Moss
man, and George Pool. These three
men, the most certain point-winners
on the Blue and Gold squad, will
cut into the Trojan scoring machine
much deeper than into Stanford's.
Chuhchill will surely win the
javelin, which McKenzie snatched
from Ray in the Trojan duel, and
Ray should out-toss his Southern
rival for second-place points. Moss
man will be favored to take the
two-mile grind from Dean Crom
well's Callahan, who nosed out
Aebersold on the Farm. Pool, if he
has a good day, will push Graber of
the Trojans to greater heights than
he has ever seen to win the pole
vault.
