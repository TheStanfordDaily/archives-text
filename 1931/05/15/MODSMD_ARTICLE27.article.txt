# Card Trackmen Board Lark For Southern Clash

### FRITZ GOODWIN 
ANOTHER crack at the heretofore invincible Trojans was the chief ob
jective of Dink 'lempleton and some 27 of his Indian track squad last
night, as they entrained on the Lark for Los Angeles and tomorrow'*
California Intercollegiates. Teams from California and U.C.L.A., besides
Stanford and S.C., will be gathered within the Coliseum, but aside from
the color of their uniforms they are expected to add little to the annual
intercollegiate alVair. With at least two of Stanford's consistent point
winners on the injured list, chances are not very strong that the Farm
athletes will be able to avenge their defeats by Troy at the dual meet
and the Fresno relays. Whether Captain Podge Smith, who has been held

! out of practice by a troublesome leg
1 muscle, would enter the hurdles in
Los Angeles was still undetermined
last night.
List of Entrants
I Men who boarded the southbound
l train from Palo Alto as entrants to
morrow were: sprints: Hcc Dyer,
i Les Hables, Ralph Giberson; quar-
I ter: Ben Eastman, Maynor Shove,
Les Hables, Ike Hables; half: Dick
Wright and Frank Fullenwider;
i mile: Sam Eastman, Bob Brown;
two-mile: Paul Aebersold; hurdles:
i Jack Brugman and A1 Nisbet; broad
; jump: Wally Butler, Bill Werder,
! Arnie West; high jump: Don Black
j man.
! Pole vault: Burt DeGroot, Bud
Deacon, Ned Johns; discus: Boh
Jones, Norman MeLeod, Here La
, borde, George Grey; shot: Nellie
Gray, George Grey, MeLeod, La
borde; mile relay: Shove. Ike Hables,
Les Hables, Eastman or Giberson.
Accompanying the athletes were
Templeton, Tom Melgaard, senior
manager, and Ernie Hatch, junior
manager.
Lomhardi Out
Frank Lombardi, sprinter, is un
able to compete because of troublr
with his arches. Fred Zuger, who
showed promise of becoming a con
sistent 200-foot javelin thrower early
in the season, has been kept out of
all the meets by a sprained back.
Podge Smith's probable absence
from the Indian line-up will leave
the hurdling burden on the shoul
ders of Nisbet and Brugman. Nisbet
was good for a brace of seconds in
i the Trojan dual meet and should be
I able to collect the same six points
! tomorrow. Brugman broke into the
j scoring column against S.C. in the
1 highs at Fresno.

Bears Will Help

Stanford has considerably more
than an outside chance against llir
Red and Gold tomorrow because of
the entrance of the Berkeley team.
For once, it seems that the Bears
may do the Indians a real favor, by
entering Ken Churchill, Spud Moss
man, and George Pool. These three
men, the most certain point-winners
on the Blue and Gold squad, will
cut into the Trojan scoring machine
much deeper than into Stanford's.
Chuhchill will surely win the
javelin, which McKenzie snatched
from Ray in the Trojan duel, and
Ray should out-toss his Southern
rival for second-place points. Moss
man will be favored to take the
two-mile grind from Dean Crom
well's Callahan, who nosed out
Aebersold on the Farm. Pool, if he
has a good day, will push Graber of
the Trojans to greater heights than
he has ever seen to win the pole
vault.

Dyer-Wykoflf Again

These famous Stanford-Troy
sprinting duels appear to have bc
: come fixed at a Wykoff century and ;
| a Dyer furlong. Nevertheless, Dyer j
' is still potentially capable of beating i
! the "Glendale flash" in the hundred, ;
! with a good start; and with an un- i
i usually poor start. WykofT has the ;
staff to pass the Indian star in the j
j 220.
For that reason, the races featur- j
j ing Dyer and Wykoff will never
j cease to give fans remarkable short j
j seconds of hair-raising suspense, j
j Les Hables is apparently in great j
j shape again, and should he run the |
i sprints in Los Angeles, the events ;
! will hold an additional interest, for !
j Hables has equalled Dyer often on '
the home oval.
Quarter a Feature
Then there is always the forth- i
I corning 440 for sports writers to go ;
into ecstacies about. When Vic Wil- j
liams of S.C. and Les Hables were ,
certain entrants the race promised
to be a thriller. Now that Dink is ;
quite certain he will run Ben East
man in this event, the prospective :
dimensions of this race have become
colossal.
At last. Eastman is going to settle j
! that old argument by stepping out j
I ahead to defeat Williams. Compara- j
tive lap times this season make that j
a safe bet. Hables has sworn to finish j
ahead of the Trojan flyer also, since |
Williams fought his way out of a (
box in the dual meet to break the
tape. Les is a good bet to come j
ithrough.
Les Faster at Fresno
Incidentally, while, Stanford was j
! winning the mile relay at Fresno in ;
! new world's record time, Hables j
stepped off a faster quarter than did I
his Trojan rival. Eastman ran still i
faster. Dope the 440 tomorrow then j
as follows: Eastman (S), first; Les
Hables (S), second; Williams (SC),
third; barring'a second performance j
of the now-famous exhibition of ;
fisticuffs which fans witnessed in !
the Troy-Stanford duel.
| The war horse of Southern Cali
j fornia, Dean Cromwell, seems to ;
! have laughed his way out of the !
I rumored pet plan to match Williams i
j against Eastman in a two-man 440 j

for all the regular points. Lucky
fellow—the Trojans will at least
have a point or two of the total 11
in a regular quarter-mile race, and
two points will be valuable in to
morrow's track classic.

Lomhardi Out
Frank Lombardi, sprinter, is un
able to compete because of troublr
with his arches. Fred Zuger, who
showed promise of becoming a con
sistent 200-foot javelin thrower early
in the season, has been kept out of
all the meets by a sprained back.
Podge Smith's probable absence
from the Indian line-up will leave
the hurdling burden on the shoul
ders of Nisbet and Brugman. Nisbet
was good for a brace of seconds in
i the Trojan dual meet and should be
I able to collect the same six points
! tomorrow. Brugman broke into the
j scoring column against S.C. in the
1 highs at Fresno.

Bears Will Help

Stanford has considerably more
than an outside chance against llir
Red and Gold tomorrow because of
the entrance of the Berkeley team.
For once, it seems that the Bears
may do the Indians a real favor, by
entering Ken Churchill, Spud Moss
man, and George Pool. These three
men, the most certain point-winners
on the Blue and Gold squad, will
cut into the Trojan scoring machine
much deeper than into Stanford's.
Chuhchill will surely win the
javelin, which McKenzie snatched
from Ray in the Trojan duel, and
Ray should out-toss his Southern
rival for second-place points. Moss
man will be favored to take the
two-mile grind from Dean Crom
well's Callahan, who nosed out
Aebersold on the Farm. Pool, if he
has a good day, will push Graber of
the Trojans to greater heights than
he has ever seen to win the pole
vault.

Dyer-Wykoflf Again

These famous Stanford-Troy
sprinting duels appear to have bc
: come fixed at a Wykoff century and ;
| a Dyer furlong. Nevertheless, Dyer j
' is still potentially capable of beating i
! the "Glendale flash" in the hundred, ;
! with a good start; and with an un- i
i usually poor start. WykofT has the ;
staff to pass the Indian star in the j
j 220.
For that reason, the races featur- j
j ing Dyer and Wykoff will never
j cease to give fans remarkable short j
j seconds of hair-raising suspense, j
j Les Hables is apparently in great j
j shape again, and should he run the |
i sprints in Los Angeles, the events ;
! will hold an additional interest, for !
j Hables has equalled Dyer often on '
the home oval.
Quarter a Feature
Then there is always the forth- i
I corning 440 for sports writers to go ;
into ecstacies about. When Vic Wil- j
liams of S.C. and Les Hables were ,
certain entrants the race promised
to be a thriller. Now that Dink is ;
quite certain he will run Ben East
man in this event, the prospective :
dimensions of this race have become
colossal.
At last. Eastman is going to settle j
! that old argument by stepping out j
I ahead to defeat Williams. Compara- j
tive lap times this season make that j
a safe bet. Hables has sworn to finish j
ahead of the Trojan flyer also, since |
Williams fought his way out of a (
box in the dual meet to break the
tape. Les is a good bet to come j
ithrough.
Les Faster at Fresno
Incidentally, while, Stanford was j
! winning the mile relay at Fresno in ;
! new world's record time, Hables j
stepped off a faster quarter than did I
his Trojan rival. Eastman ran still i
faster. Dope the 440 tomorrow then j
as follows: Eastman (S), first; Les
Hables (S), second; Williams (SC),
third; barring'a second performance j
of the now-famous exhibition of ;
fisticuffs which fans witnessed in !
the Troy-Stanford duel.
| The war horse of Southern Cali
j fornia, Dean Cromwell, seems to ;

I rumored pet plan to match Williams i
j against Eastman in a two-man 440 j

for all the regular points. Lucky
fellow—the Trojans will at least
have a point or two of the total 11
in a regular quarter-mile race, and
two points will be valuable in to
morrow's track classic.
ANOTHER crack at the heretofore invincible Trojans was the chief ob
jective of Dink 'lempleton and some 27 of his Indian track squad last
night, as they entrained on the Lark for Los Angeles and tomorrow'*
California Intercollegiates. Teams from California and U.C.L.A., besides
Stanford and S.C., will be gathered within the Coliseum, but aside from
the color of their uniforms they are expected to add little to the annual
intercollegiate alVair. With at least two of Stanford's consistent point
winners on the injured list, chances are not very strong that the Farm
athletes will be able to avenge their defeats by Troy at the dual meet
and the Fresno relays. Whether Captain Podge Smith, who has been held

! out of practice by a troublesome leg
1 muscle, would enter the hurdles in
Los Angeles was still undetermined

the hurdling burden on the shoul
ders of Nisbet and Brugman. Nisbet
was good for a brace of seconds in
i the Trojan dual meet and should be
I able to collect the same six points
! tomorrow. Brugman broke into the
j scoring column against S.C. in the
1 highs at Fresno.

Bears Will Help

Stanford has considerably more
than an outside chance against llir
Red and Gold tomorrow because of
the entrance of the Berkeley team.
For once, it seems that the Bears
may do the Indians a real favor, by
entering Ken Churchill, Spud Moss
man, and George Pool. These three
men, the most certain point-winners
on the Blue and Gold squad, will
cut into the Trojan scoring machine
much deeper than into Stanford's.
Chuhchill will surely win the
javelin, which McKenzie snatched
from Ray in the Trojan duel, and
Ray should out-toss his Southern
rival for second-place points. Moss
man will be favored to take the
two-mile grind from Dean Crom
well's Callahan, who nosed out
Aebersold on the Farm. Pool, if he
has a good day, will push Graber of
the Trojans to greater heights than
he has ever seen to win the pole
vault.

Dyer-Wykoflf Again

These famous Stanford-Troy
sprinting duels appear to have bc
: come fixed at a Wykoff century and ;
| a Dyer furlong. Nevertheless, Dyer j
' is still potentially capable of beating i
! the "Glendale flash" in the hundred, ;
! with a good start; and with an un- i
i usually poor start. WykofT has the ;
staff to pass the Indian star in the j
j 220.
For that reason, the races featur- j
j ing Dyer and Wykoff will never
j cease to give fans remarkable short j
j seconds of hair-raising suspense, j
j Les Hables is apparently in great j
j shape again, and should he run the |
i sprints in Los Angeles, the events ;
! will hold an additional interest, for !
j Hables has equalled Dyer often on '
the home oval.
Quarter a Feature
Then there is always the forth- i
I corning 440 for sports writers to go ;
into ecstacies about. When Vic Wil- j
liams of S.C. and Les Hables were ,
certain entrants the race promised
to be a thriller. Now that Dink is ;
quite certain he will run Ben East
man in this event, the prospective :
dimensions of this race have become
colossal.
At last. Eastman is going to settle j
! that old argument by stepping out j
I ahead to defeat Williams. Compara- j
tive lap times this season make that j
a safe bet. Hables has sworn to finish j
ahead of the Trojan flyer also, since |
Williams fought his way out of a (
box in the dual meet to break the
tape. Les is a good bet to come j
ithrough.
Les Faster at Fresno
Incidentally, while, Stanford was j
! winning the mile relay at Fresno in ;
! new world's record time, Hables j
stepped off a faster quarter than did I
his Trojan rival. Eastman ran still i
faster. Dope the 440 tomorrow then j
as follows: Eastman (S), first; Les
Hables (S), second; Williams (SC),
third; barring'a second performance j
of the now-famous exhibition of ;
fisticuffs which fans witnessed in !
the Troy-Stanford duel.

in a regular quarter-mile race, and

jective of Dink 'lempleton and some 27 of his Indian track squad last
night, as they entrained on the Lark for Los Angeles and tomorrow'*
California Intercollegiates. Teams from California and U.C.L.A., besides
Stanford and S.C., will be gathered within the Coliseum, but aside from
the color of their uniforms they are expected to add little to the annual
intercollegiate alVair. With at least two of Stanford's consistent point
winners on the injured list, chances are not very strong that the Farm
athletes will be able to avenge their defeats by Troy at the dual meet
and the Fresno relays. Whether Captain Podge Smith, who has been held

! out of practice by a troublesome leg

Los Angeles was still undetermined
