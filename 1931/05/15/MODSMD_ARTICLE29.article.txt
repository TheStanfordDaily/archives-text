Washington and Jefferson, pron(l of being the oldest
college in western Pennsylvania, is the scene of much ex
citement. Last month its 150 students walked out of a
chapel meeting when President Simon S. Raker rose to
address them. This week Dr. Baker resigned.
The reason given by the striking students was that the
college head was not in sympathy with their athletic and
academic activities. Dr. Baker in reply said he had tried
to win their friendship, but had not been successful. So
now he is out.
A college president not in sympathy with student ac
tivities can expect little student sympathy with his activi
ties. And without the sympathetic support of the majority
of the students under him, any college president is bound
to find his work pretty dillicult. No matter how good a
president Dr. Baker was, he alone couldn't do the job. 11 is
resignation is probably a personal tragedy for himself, but
for Washington and Jefferson it will possibly be a real
benefit if his successor is an able maif and can enlist
student support.
