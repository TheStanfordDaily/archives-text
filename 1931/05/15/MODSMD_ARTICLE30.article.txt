When Iho subjects of women, religion, and polities have
heen exhausted and hull-sessions begin to lag, then some
body always injects new life in the discussion by panning
The Daily's editorial columns. For those who consider
I)AiLY-roasting as an indoor sport of no mean attraction,
Tm: Daily takes the liberty of telling the following story
concerning The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, reprinted from
an article in the current issue of The American Mercury.
It seems that old-time editorial writers on the Post-
Dispatch, in the days before prohibition, were in the habit
of dropping in at a beer garden to consume a little refresh
ment before going to work. One of the men, who had dal
lied overlong at the palace of liquid pleasure, arrived at
the Post-Dispatch office one day and found on his desk
three editorial assignments. He was to write one editorial
about a Russian-Japanese naval engagement just passed,
one on the Panama Canal, and one on conditions in lowa.
With the best of intentions, the writer sat down at his
typewriter and proceeded to make the keys hum.
Readers of the Post-Dispatch were greatly amazed on
the following day when they perused the editorial columns
and found, ltot three separate editorials, but only one,
slightly garbled, concerning a recent battle between the
Russian and Japanese navies, staged in an lowa canal.
The moral of this editorial is, Don't be too willing to
condemn. There may be no beer gardens hearabouts, but,
after all, it's spring, isn't it?
