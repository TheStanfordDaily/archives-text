From the University of Washington comes the news
that a plan is under consideration to institute a one-unit
course in student affairs as conducted by the A.S.I'.W.
Instruction in those matters, the advocates of the plan be
lieve. would make for "constructive, intelligent, better and
more effective A.S.U.W. government."
in a university where the student government is a real
factor in the lives of the students, instead of a mere frame
work of offices the majority whose holders do nothing,
sife'li a move would be a laudable one. For Stanford, it
would be worse than useless.
