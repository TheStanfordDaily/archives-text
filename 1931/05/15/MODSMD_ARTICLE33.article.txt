COLLEGE FORUM—A RELIEF
(The Oregon Daily Emerald)
A few energetic young journalists
at Stanford University joined hands
the other day to publish a magazine
which would have been called the
"Stanford Forum," had not the pres
ident of the university set his jaw,
slammed down his fist, and snapped
out the decision "No!" Just how such
a good livewire magazine as those
boys are publishing could besmirch
that precious Stanford name, we do
not know.
Well, anyway, the book was issued
under the name of "College Forum."
And it is a dandy—sparkling, light,
and extremely readable. It is a credit
to the colleges of the Pacific Coast,
and let us thank the Stanford Uni
versity president for lending his in
fluence in making it a general maga
zine rather than restricting it to a
single campus or stunting its popu
larity by becoming a university or
gan of propaganda.
Editor Gunnar Norberg has the
right idea. His aim in publishing the
magazine is to give student writers,
who are edged out in the competitive
fields of established periodicals, a
chance to present their wares. Col
lege Forum "makes it definitely its
policy to have as contributors en
tirely, so far as possible—college stu
dents." As evidenced by his first is
sue, he aims to have the publication
sell—for it is flashy, attractive, and
neat—even though the stories in
cluded may not be wholly sound.
It is exceedingly refreshing to see
a few young writers come right out
with the dope on subjects they be
lieve they know more about than do
a gang of greybeards who make their
approaches quietly yet philosophi
cally sound. It takes students to tell
whether or not college educates.
Well, David G. Lyon, of the Univer
sity of California, writes a "criticism
of criticism" in his story on "Does
College Educate?'" And Som (Some
body) says, "To Hell with Examina
tions! Let's Learn Something."
Each of these boys has hit upon a
good subject for any discussion.
They've started something and
they're starting it right, and our
wish is that it will continue. A story
written by a member of the Oregon
Daily Emerald staff is 1o appear in
an issue of the College Forum in
the near future.

AS THE GLOOMY DEAN SEES IT
(St. Louis Post-Dispatch)
Having put in 40 years at the Uni
versity of Illinois watching the
capering freshmen depart as solemn
seniors, Thomas Arkle Clark is per
suaded that "petting can't be
stopped." Those were his words to
a conference of fellow deans down
in Tennessee last week. Warming to
his subject, he asserted "there has
been petting since Adam and Eve,
and there always will be." The stony
silence in which his judgment was
received must be construed as mel
ancholy acquiescence.
It is of this melancholy acquie
scence we would fain speak. It oc
curs to us that those censors of the
campus are looking at life from what
someone has called the wrong slant.
It is one of the treasured tenets of
their philosophy, apparently, that
the higher education should be a de
naturing process. They yearn to be
lieve that because a maiden chooses
briefly to wear the sandals of Hypa
tia she shall be emancipated from
the tempests Sappho knew and sang,
that somewhere along the bleak road
of learning our Apollos shall be
metamorphosed into Anthonys.
It is not the office of education to
loss Chicago pineapples at the cos
mic urge. Petting is an institution
more lasting than marble or bronze
or steel or concrete. If that makes
deans gloomy, the gloom is all theirs.

AS THE GLOOMY DEAN SEES IT
(St. Louis Post-Dispatch)
Having put in 40 years at the Uni
versity of Illinois watching the
capering freshmen depart as solemn
seniors, Thomas Arkle Clark is per
suaded that "petting can't be
stopped." Those were his words to
a conference of fellow deans down
in Tennessee last week. Warming to
his subject, he asserted "there has
been petting since Adam and Eve,
and there always will be." The stony
silence in which his judgment was
received must be construed as mel
ancholy acquiescence.
It is of this melancholy acquie
scence we would fain speak. It oc
curs to us that those censors of the
campus are looking at life from what
someone has called the wrong slant.
It is one of the treasured tenets of
their philosophy, apparently, that
the higher education should be a de
naturing process. They yearn to be
lieve that because a maiden chooses
briefly to wear the sandals of Hypa
tia she shall be emancipated from
the tempests Sappho knew and sang,
that somewhere along the bleak road
of learning our Apollos shall be
metamorphosed into Anthonys.
It is not the office of education to
loss Chicago pineapples at the cos
mic urge. Petting is an institution
more lasting than marble or bronze
or steel or concrete. If that makes
deans gloomy, the gloom is all theirs.
COLLEGE FORUM—A RELIEF
(The Oregon Daily Emerald)
A few energetic young journalists
at Stanford University joined hands
the other day to publish a magazine
which would have been called the
"Stanford Forum," had not the pres
ident of the university set his jaw,
slammed down his fist, and snapped
out the decision "No!" Just how such
a good livewire magazine as those
boys are publishing could besmirch
that precious Stanford name, we do
not know.
Well, anyway, the book was issued
under the name of "College Forum."
And it is a dandy—sparkling, light,
and extremely readable. It is a credit
to the colleges of the Pacific Coast,
and let us thank the Stanford Uni
versity president for lending his in
fluence in making it a general maga
zine rather than restricting it to a
single campus or stunting its popu
larity by becoming a university or
gan of propaganda.
Editor Gunnar Norberg has the
right idea. His aim in publishing the
magazine is to give student writers,
who are edged out in the competitive
fields of established periodicals, a
chance to present their wares. Col
lege Forum "makes it definitely its
policy to have as contributors en
tirely, so far as possible—college stu
dents." As evidenced by his first is
sue, he aims to have the publication
sell—for it is flashy, attractive, and
neat—even though the stories in
cluded may not be wholly sound.
It is exceedingly refreshing to see
a few young writers come right out
with the dope on subjects they be
lieve they know more about than do
a gang of greybeards who make their
approaches quietly yet philosophi
cally sound. It takes students to tell
whether or not college educates.
Well, David G. Lyon, of the Univer
sity of California, writes a "criticism
of criticism" in his story on "Does
College Educate?'" And Som (Some
body) says, "To Hell with Examina
tions! Let's Learn Something."
Each of these boys has hit upon a
good subject for any discussion.
They've started something and
they're starting it right, and our
wish is that it will continue. A story
written by a member of the Oregon
Daily Emerald staff is 1o appear in
an issue of the College Forum in
the near future.
