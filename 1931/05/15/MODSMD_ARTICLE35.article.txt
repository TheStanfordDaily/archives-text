## 
### 
Auto racing comes back into its
own in San Jose on Sunday, May 25,
when local speedway officials stage
a big seven-event show on the re
built five-eighths mile oval.
The main event jÂ»i!l be over the
50-lap distance witn three shorter
auto races and three motorcycle
events supporting the bill.
The largest purse ever offered by
San Jose racing officials has been
put up for the winners in order to
get the cream of the Pacific Coast
dirt track crop interested.
The four turns of the track have
been made wider and banked higher
and a new slick oiled surface is now
ready for the event that is likely to
see several records set.
