"ILLOGICAL TRIPE"
The Editor, Sir:
If one is to be judged by the com
pany he keeps or the papers he
reads (and writes for), then the
viewpoint of our Hearst-while
friend, Mr. Monteagle, can readily
be understood. In his recent contri
bution to Campus Opinion, he seems
to be seizing his own opportunity to
make a fool of himself. He has done
this before in his journalistic career
elsewhere and, I must say, succeeded
admirably—at the expense of his fel
low students.
I fully realize the futility of ad
vising Mr. Monteagle on interna
tional political matters; but, if a
mere economist may be permitted to
enroll in the ranks of his "shrewd
scholar" critics long enough to brand
his nonsense as "illogical tripe," it
would be greatly appreciated.
We owe thanks to its author for
the fact that the "illogical tripe" did
not include any more quotations
from Washington's Farewell Address
etc. Yet it's bad enough. These
"neurotic nincompoops" (apologies to
Mr. Fagan), thinking as of 1787, are
the very ones who, by preaching
isolationism, prevent the League
and the World Court from being all
that they should be. Without the
OFFICIAL participation of the
United States in international politi
cal affairs, including the League and
Permanent Court of International
Justice, there seems little hope of
ever quelling the fears of other na
tions and developing that sense of
security which is so essential for
further limitation of armaments,
compulsory arbitration, and peace.
The present inadequacy of our in
ternational political organization to
cope with modern world economic
problems is perhaps the basic factor
causing most of our modern troubles
—including the present depression—
and the fundamental grounds for
our lack of a divine faith in an im
possible peace for the present at
least. Isolationism as bi'oadcast by
Hearst and Monteagle is doing noth
ing to attain that end.
