The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Osborne is quite right, in his
answer to Mr. Muller's letter en
titled "Better to Train Now." "Illogi
cal thinking will not serve to solve
the problem, while intelligent public
opinion may," says Mr. Osborne.
Undoubtedly it is the "intelligent
public opinion" that Mr. Osborne
flatters himself in thinking he ex
presses.
If we must disarm and expect
public opinion to prevent war, why
not dismiss the police and expect the
criminals, touched by such mag
nanimity, to stop their activity?
Mr. Osborne compares war with
duelling, and suggests that it be
controlled in the same manner. Who
is going to control the "Capitalists
and various propagandists," who, he
believes cause war? The govern
ment, perchance? Then let Mr. Os
borne advocate Socialism!
Perhaps he believes in one coun
try dominating the others? Napo
leon fought to stop war.
Or in an international army,
strong enough to suppress the com
bined forces of say, Germany and
Italy? Who would be in that army?
Germans and Italians? Or French
and British?
Mr. Osborne brings up the point
that history repeats itself. Why not
look back fuither than the War of
1914? The strong countries have al
ways picked on the weak.
And, incidentally, it is a queer
repetition of history, that ihe paci
fists in (he time of peace always cry
for military protection in time of
war. See you in (he army, Mr. Os
borne. —Mike DoudorfT.
