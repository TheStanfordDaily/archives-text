# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
The student body has expressed
its opinion in regards the honor
system; but what that opinion is few
would risk stating. The answers to
the questions have been tabulated
but they are slightly contradicting,
to say the least. In the first place,
the students believe the Honor Code
is not successful and yet they seem
to prefer the honor system over the
proctor system.
This can signify only two things—
either the students desire to work
under a system they admit is not
successful, or that the student body
feels that the Honor Code is capable
of enforcement—thus being made
successful. The first possibility must
be ruled out for to claim seriously
that intelligent students would pre
fer a system that is perpetually
doomed to failure is to state some
kind of a contradiction.
The only other conclusion to be
derived from the poll would be that
the students feel that it is possible
to so enforce the code that that
which is a failure (according to the
vote) can be made successful. This
would be fairly logical and clear if
the poll had not also revealed that
the students are overwhelmingly
against reporting violators. Only 310
students out of 3,125 students on I he
campus this quarter claimed that
they would report a violator, and
only 35 per cent of the few students
who did vole stated that they would

[ play policeman for the enforcement i
! of the Honor Code.
Assuming that the newly elected
Council will be even more stringent
! than past Councils at Stanford, the
situation still seems doomed to fail- |
j ure. How can five men—the five i
most stringent, unwavering, un- 1
flinching men in the world—enforce
: the Code if the students do not re- |
i port violators? The two Councils can j
| pass law after law, but inert reso- j
lutions cannot detect cheaters; and
! unless cheaters are detected the j
j Honor Code is only a code for the
! honest.
Now, few will deny that as a
■ "code" the present practice is soul
j inspiring and flattering. As a work- j
I ing system, however, the majority !
of the voting students have claimed
that it is a failure. It is a failure
: because the students do not appre
] date the full significance of the
Code. The full meaning of the honor
i system requires every student to
protect that honor by reporting vio
i lators without fear or prejudice.
J There is still some hope for the sys
[ tem, however. The new Council has
j pledged itself to rigid enforcement,
! and at least 310 students have stated
I their intention to report cheaters.
| If the 310 will report cheaters and
| the Council will punish with force
; and certainty, the Honor Code may
j still be made a real working force.

to so enforce the code that that
which is a failure (according to the
vote) can be made successful. This
would be fairly logical and clear if
the poll had not also revealed that
the students are overwhelmingly
against reporting violators. Only 310
students out of 3,125 students on I he
campus this quarter claimed that
they would report a violator, and
only 35 per cent of the few students
who did vole stated that they would

[ play policeman for the enforcement i
! of the Honor Code.
Assuming that the newly elected
Council will be even more stringent
! than past Councils at Stanford, the
situation still seems doomed to fail- |
j ure. How can five men—the five i
most stringent, unwavering, un- 1
flinching men in the world—enforce
: the Code if the students do not re- |
i port violators? The two Councils can j
| pass law after law, but inert reso- j
lutions cannot detect cheaters; and
! unless cheaters are detected the j
j Honor Code is only a code for the
! honest.
Now, few will deny that as a
■ "code" the present practice is soul
j inspiring and flattering. As a work- j
I ing system, however, the majority !
of the voting students have claimed
that it is a failure. It is a failure
: because the students do not appre
] date the full significance of the
Code. The full meaning of the honor
i system requires every student to
protect that honor by reporting vio
i lators without fear or prejudice.
J There is still some hope for the sys
[ tem, however. The new Council has
j pledged itself to rigid enforcement,
! and at least 310 students have stated
I their intention to report cheaters.
| If the 310 will report cheaters and
| the Council will punish with force
; and certainty, the Honor Code may
j still be made a real working force.

The student body has expressed
its opinion in regards the honor
system; but what that opinion is few
would risk stating. The answers to
the questions have been tabulated
but they are slightly contradicting,
to say the least. In the first place,
the students believe the Honor Code
is not successful and yet they seem
to prefer the honor system over the
proctor system.
This can signify only two things—
either the students desire to work
under a system they admit is not
successful, or that the student body
feels that the Honor Code is capable
of enforcement—thus being made
successful. The first possibility must
be ruled out for to claim seriously
that intelligent students would pre
fer a system that is perpetually
doomed to failure is to state some
kind of a contradiction.
The only other conclusion to be
derived from the poll would be that
the students feel that it is possible
to so enforce the code that that
which is a failure (according to the
vote) can be made successful. This
would be fairly logical and clear if
