ALISON'S HOUSE—By Susan Glas
pell. Samuel French. 1930. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
As the worshiping family of Ali
i son, gentle poetess, -deft her house
i forever, the poems written in the
anguish of her love were discovered.
These expressed her loneliness so
J terribly that her brother and sister
' wanted to destroy them.
It was Alison, finally, speaking
j through Elsa, she who had broken
! the code which the poetess could
not, who won the combat with her
brother to preserve the poignant evi
i dence of the tremendous struggle
which had broken her heart.
Such is "Alison's House," a fasci
nating and beautiful drama, quietly
j powerful. Reading it one feels the
I conflict between desire to keep the
frustrated love of Alison from the
j sensation-seekers, and the hope to
j give her greatest work to a world
! which she loved.
That the Pulitzer Prize Committee
: presented honors to this unheralded
and comparatively obscure drama
while such spectacular preachments
! as "Five Star Final" were on the
! boards, seems odd. We are glad that
• they did. —J.S.S.

CAN THESE THINGS BE — By
George Seldes. Brewer and War
ren. 1931.
The author of "You Can't Print
That" has furthered his debunking
efforts with another lengthy tome
exposing more of the inside dope on
European affairs with a leavening of
piquant insights into the lives of
such notorious people as the well
lovered Isadora Duncan and the
spectacular Queen Marie.
George Seldes was one of the most
prying and most successful of
American war correspondents and,
having retired, is spending his time
painting quite successfully and
printing the sort of things his em
ployers never dared print.
If his information is true it is im
portant and even if it is not it is
interesting. Both his style and his
material are l'eminiscent of that
widely read weekly "Time" and cer
tainly more startling.
An interesting source of questions
to brighten up the dullest political
science lecturer and thought-encour
aging reading even for an English
major. —S.C.A.

not, who won the combat with her
brother to preserve the poignant evi
i dence of the tremendous struggle
which had broken her heart.
Such is "Alison's House," a fasci
nating and beautiful drama, quietly
j powerful. Reading it one feels the
I conflict between desire to keep the
frustrated love of Alison from the
j sensation-seekers, and the hope to
j give her greatest work to a world
! which she loved.
That the Pulitzer Prize Committee
: presented honors to this unheralded
and comparatively obscure drama
while such spectacular preachments
! as "Five Star Final" were on the
! boards, seems odd. We are glad that
• they did. —J.S.S.

CAN THESE THINGS BE — By
George Seldes. Brewer and War
ren. 1931.
The author of "You Can't Print
That" has furthered his debunking
efforts with another lengthy tome
exposing more of the inside dope on
European affairs with a leavening of
piquant insights into the lives of
such notorious people as the well
lovered Isadora Duncan and the
spectacular Queen Marie.
George Seldes was one of the most
prying and most successful of
American war correspondents and,
having retired, is spending his time
painting quite successfully and
printing the sort of things his em
ployers never dared print.
If his information is true it is im
portant and even if it is not it is
interesting. Both his style and his
material are l'eminiscent of that
widely read weekly "Time" and cer
tainly more startling.
An interesting source of questions
to brighten up the dullest political
science lecturer and thought-encour
aging reading even for an English
major. —S.C.A.
