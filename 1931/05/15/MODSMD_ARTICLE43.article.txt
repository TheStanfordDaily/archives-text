The powers that be having de
! cided (hat (he students haven't been
| annoyed in quite a while, the wreck
i ing crew is once again busy tearing
i up sections of pavement, asphalt,
| gas mains, etc., in the vicinity of
the Postoffice. Anything to relieve
j the unemployment situation.

The catch-as-catch-can boys
had a swell time yesterday at
the University rassling cham
pecnships, with returns from
crutch rentals having tripled,
Paly merchants report. Those
who lost no arms and legs meet
tonight in the finals. Tweest
lieem, Gar-r-rdini!

At the same time, the Sigma Nus
and those there Tovon Club fellas

i will stage a few individual cham
: pionships, also catch-as-catch-can.
| Student body cards will not admit
1 to those, however.

Tomorrow Stanford meets the
i Southern California Athletic Club
i down in the Coliseum, with Cal and
U.C.L.A. yapping at their heels for
| a scrap here and there. We hope
I friend Williams runs in carpet slip
' pers, so that he won't have to put
1 his hand out to keep from spiking a
Stanford runner, bless his little
i heart!

Maybe they ought to change it
to (he D.G.A.A. now, instead of
the W.A.A. And, Imelda darling,
what makes you think there will
be any dirty rushing in Koble
next year, with only five Row
sponsors?
