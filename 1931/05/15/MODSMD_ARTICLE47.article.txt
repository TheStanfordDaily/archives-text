figured to carry his blue and
gold trunks across.the finish line

This "Big Four" meet is only
three years old, hut its history
is interesting. Fn 1929, Templcton |
took his team South to the first
meet, armed with his now-fam

won the affair by a goodly mar
gin, but each Cardinal runner
that used Dink's pet invention
was disqualified, giving the Tro- i

three years old, hut its history
is interesting. Fn 1929, Templcton |

that used Dink's pet invention
was disqualified, giving the Tro- i

Fan sat bewailing the fate of |
some 27 athletes, the cream of j
young manhood on the Farm,

night. "What a pity," moaned S. I
Fan, an out-and-out barbecue.
Those brutal Trojans will butch- ;
