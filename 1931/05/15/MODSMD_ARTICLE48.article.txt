# Indians, Webfoots Vie for Pacific Golf Title
## SIX DIVOT-DIGGERS FACE OREGON MEN AT EUGENE TODAY Chance Of Card Win Good; Team Has Outclassed All Opponents 
### 
I
Carrying upon their shoulders.
Stanford's hopes for a coast inter
i collegiate title, six of the Farm's
| finest golfers clash with the Uni
versity of Oregon's northern cham
pions today at Eugene.
Competition is to consist of 36
j holes of medal play for each mem
j ber of the six-man teams. To the
| group with the low four-man aggre
! gate goes victory and the coast
! crown.

Cards May Win

j Chances for an Indian win are
I good. The team, which includes
i Malcolm MacNaughton, Bud Eichel
j berger, Bob Goldwater, Warner Ed-
I monds, Herman Hellman, and Stuart
| Hawley, has outclassed all Califor-
J nia opposition in taking the south
| ern division title.
Outstanding member of the squad
] is Malcolm MacNaughton, who was
| the winner of the southern section
j individual title in the same tourna
j ment in which the Cards took t Fie
j team honors. Mac, who learned his
I golf in Oregon by the way, is to
| meet Vince Dolp of the Webfoots for
j the coast individual championship
I Saturday.
Dolp, MacNaughton, and Don Moe,
three of the Northwest's great play
ers, used to be on the same high
[school team. Mac ranked third then
and still does.

Will flanks First

Yet Dolp isn't even first man on
i the Oregon team. George Will,
I maker of 68's in two recent dual
meets, holds that position.

Shafer and Kincaid, third and
j fourth men for the Webfoots, have
i not been playing as consistently
good golf as any of the last four
Indian men.
The fly in the ointment is Don
Moe. Enrolled at Oregon this se
! mester, he has abstained from com
j petitive golf because of studies.
| With a Pacific Coast title as incen
: tive, he may be persuaded to rep
! resent Oregon. If he plays, Indian
i stock will take a big drop. A col
j lege team including Don Moe, Vince
Dolp, and George Will seems a little
j too good to lose. Now if they were
| only clashing with a team contain-
I ing Charlie Seaver, Lawson Little,
and Malcolm MacNaughton—.

Carrying upon their shoulders.
Stanford's hopes for a coast inter
i collegiate title, six of the Farm's
| finest golfers clash with the Uni
versity of Oregon's northern cham
pions today at Eugene.
Competition is to consist of 36
j holes of medal play for each mem
j ber of the six-man teams. To the
| group with the low four-man aggre
! gate goes victory and the coast
! crown.

Cards May Win

j Chances for an Indian win are
I good. The team, which includes
i Malcolm MacNaughton, Bud Eichel
j berger, Bob Goldwater, Warner Ed-
I monds, Herman Hellman, and Stuart
| Hawley, has outclassed all Califor-
J nia opposition in taking the south
| ern division title.
Outstanding member of the squad
] is Malcolm MacNaughton, who was
| the winner of the southern section
j individual title in the same tourna
j ment in which the Cards took t Fie
j team honors. Mac, who learned his
I golf in Oregon by the way, is to
| meet Vince Dolp of the Webfoots for
j the coast individual championship
I Saturday.
Dolp, MacNaughton, and Don Moe,
three of the Northwest's great play
ers, used to be on the same high
[school team. Mac ranked third then
and still does.

Will flanks First

Yet Dolp isn't even first man on
i the Oregon team. George Will,
I maker of 68's in two recent dual
meets, holds that position.

Shafer and Kincaid, third and
j fourth men for the Webfoots, have
i not been playing as consistently
good golf as any of the last four
Indian men.
