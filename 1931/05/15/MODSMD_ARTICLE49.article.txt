the play into the third round. Ter
williger and Plymire defeated Boyd

Mary Lee Richmond and Trow
Stephens moved into the quarter
finals by defeating Wiel and Thorpe
5-7, G-2, 6-2. Richmond and Steph
ens drew a bye in the first round.
Excellent tennis by the women
was the feature of the play yester
day. On more than one occasion
these representatives of the "500"
proved to be the "better-half" of a
team combination.
Play has been going rather slowly
in the tournament so far. Elwyn
Bugge, chairman of the committee
in charge of the tourney, is anxious
that entrants play their matches off
immediately. All second round
matches must be finished by Satur
day of this week, on penalty of de
fault.
