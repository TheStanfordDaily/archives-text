## 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
As a result of yesterday's intra
mural ball games, a triple tie now
exists in League IV. In this league j
Theta Chi defeated Sigma Alpha
Epsilon 11 to 4 and El Tigre won a !
last-inning victory from Sequoia. In
League 11, El Campo triumphed over
El Cuadro 11 to 7.
The Sequoia-Tigre meeting was re- j
plete with thrills. Enjoying a thre- 1 - j
to-one lead in the opening of the j
sixth inning, El Tigre found their !
advantage suddenly wiped away !
when Silva drew a walk and Far
well, Leonard, and Jensen singled
in succession to score three runs.
Scoring Errors
El Tigre had gone hitless the ;
whole game, but aided with walks |
and errors had managed to score |
two runs in the first inning and to j
add one in the third. Thereafter they j
could not score until the last of the â€¢
seventh inning when Shipey walked '
and scored with the tieing run. j
Mack, Sequoia pitcher, then walked !
Wilson and Bernard drove out the j
only Tigre hit of the game to win '

the game.
Mack allowed the victors only one
hit and struck out 11 of them but
i issued too many passes. Wilson,
; hurling for El Tigre, fanned 12 men
land allowed 7 hits. Cohen caught lor
El Tigre; Baker for Sequoia.

| enth inning but in that frame El
j Campo got to Ricklefs for 4 hits and

j bid to overcome this lead in its half
iof the seventh but its drive was
i stemmed alter two runs had scored.
