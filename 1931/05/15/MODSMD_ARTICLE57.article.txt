# S.A.E. TENNIS MEN MAKE SEMI-FINALS IN MURAL TOURNEY
## 
### 
Three of the four semi-final
brackets of the intramural tennis
tournament became filled yesterday
when Sigma Alpha Epsilon advanced
over the Southerners 111 by a 2-0
score. Blethen and Wearer made up
the fraternity team, and Mathias
and Tobias played as the Southern
ers.
This puts S.A.E. in the bracket
opposite Southerners 11, who will be
represented by Petterson and Gor
don, two high-ranking varsity men.
Blethen, however, recently scored
an upset in the San Jose Tennis
Club tournament by breaking
through Niederauer, seeded number
two, and is favored to do his share
in the mural contest.
Delta Upsilon and Encina Base
ment have not yet played off the
only remaining quarter-final match.
