# INDIAN-HUSKY NET STARS CLASH FOR CONFERENCE TITLE
## Time Of Match Unsettled; Probably Will Be 10 Or 2 o'Clock 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship tennis honors will be de
cided either today or tomorrow
when Captain Ted Easton and Keith
Gledhill meet the University of
Washington representatives on the
local courts.
Definite announcement of the time
of play is impossible until the Wash
ington team is consulted, since the
choice is theirs, but it will, in all
j probability, take place at 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning. If the Huskies
decide they would rather play this
afternoon the encounter wfil be at
2 o'clock.
Lloyd Drodstrom and George
Hoyt, representing the northern
champions for 1931, are of such cal
iber that they are certain to prove
worthy contenders for the coast title.
Nordstrom was northwest junior
champion three years ago, and was
sent east last year by Oregon.
Singles Planned
Two singles contests will be
played, probably with the arrange
ment of Gledhill versus Nordstrom
and Easton versus Hoyt, which wilt
be followed by a doubles encoun
ter. The same two Indian stars will
also handle the doubles event, and
hope to pull out victories in at least
two out of the three tilts to cinch
the laurels they have worked all
season to attain.
Last year the Pacific Coast Con
ference was divided into two divi
sions, north and south, as now, but
there was no direct play-off. A
tournament was held to decide the
Pacific Coast individual honors,
which were carried off by Elbert
Lewis of U.C.L.A. Oregon took the
I northern honors and California the
! southern. This year, however, Wash
ington came out on top up north,
while Stanford made a clean sweep
of the south. Thus the week-end
matches here will be the first en
counter between northeiTL and
southern division champions.

Fishermen off Ballantrae Banks,
Scotland, recently caught a 500-
pound bottle-nosed whale in their
nets.
