# SOCRATES CHOSEN WORLD'S GREATEST MAN BY STUDENTS
## Literary Class Of Hawaii University Votes Unanimously 
### 
(Special to The Daily) May 13—
There is only one world's greatest
man and he is Socrates.
This, at least, is the opinion of
thirty-seven world literature stu
dents of the University of Hawaii
who recently cast their votes for the
world's twenty greatest individuals.
Of the one hundred and forty-seven
candidates nominated, Socrates alone
was able to draw a full vote. None
of the twelve women named were
included in the first score.
Socrates may be the greatest but
Confucius is almost as great, it was
decided when thirty-six voted for
the Chinese sage. Plato, Aristotle,
Christ, and Shakespeare were ihe
only others to reach the ihirty mark.
Closely following these were Lin
coln, Buddha, Beethoven, Darwin,
and Michael Angelo, while Goethe,
Pasteur, Franklin, Leonardo Da
Vinci, Sun Yat Sen, Milton, Emer
son, and- Dante also received more
than a dozen votes. A musician, two
religious leaders, and one great gen
eral tied for twentieth place, Bach,
Mohammed, Martin Luther, and
Napoleon sharing honors.
The world literature class includes
in its memberships the representa
tives of five nationalities: American,
Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and
Hawaiian.
