# DUMB DOWAGER TWISTED; SEEKS COOLIDGE HOME
## 
### 
OCENE on a certain nearby
hilltop: a limousine glided
easily up the incline but jerked
to a stop as its driver spied a
certain professor toiling with
his lawn-mower. Out leaned a
a matron who asked the
wearied doctor, "Can you tell
us where Mr. Coolidge lives?"
"Mr. Coolidge lives in North
ampton, Massachusetts," was
the tired reply.
"What?" queried the plump
person.
"Mr. Coolidge lives in North
ampton."
"But I heard he had a house
here somewhere."
"No, I know all the houses
near here and none of them are
his," answered the perverse
prof.
Then followed a pause very
pausingly, and the gentleman
weakening at the dismayed look
which covered the lady tourist's
face, added: "But if by any
chance you would like to see
Mr. Hoover's house, it is just
hack of you." Then he fled.
