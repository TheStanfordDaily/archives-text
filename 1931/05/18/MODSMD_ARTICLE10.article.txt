## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 17. {&)â€”'The
Supreme Court will come back from
a fortnight's recess tomorrow deter
mined to dispose of a long list of
cases awaiting decision before ad
journing for the summer.
On the list is Arizona's attack
upon validity of the law authorizing
construction of Hoover Dam on the
Colorado river.
The court also has before it chal
lenges of President Hoover's oil con
servation policy, the California red
flag law, the Minnesota press sup
pression law, and the Indiana tax
on chain stores.
Naturalization cases before the
court are attracting wide attention.
They are the efforts of the govern
ment to exclude from citizenship
the Rev. Douglas O. Macintosh and
Maria A. Bland, the former a pro
fessor of theology at Yale and the
latter a nurse in New York City.
They declined to take an unquali
fied oath agreeing to bear arms in
defense of the government in any
war in which it might become em
broiled. Both are Canadians.
