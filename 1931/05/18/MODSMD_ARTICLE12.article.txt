# BOULDER TOWN BUSINESS WILL BE RESTRICTED
## Community's Future After 1938 Is Considered Very Uncertain 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 17 (/P). —
The government's instructions to j
business seekers at Boulder City,
' Nev., the construction camp at Hoo- j
ver Dam, issued today, warned that j
business will be pretty well limited;
I that no profits can be guaranteed; I
1 that the climate may be too extreme i
for many, and that no one knows j
i what will happen to the community j
after 1938, when the dam is com- j
1 pleted.
Special Limitations
, For the present, ordinary whole- '
sale and retail business will be lim
ited to two competitors in each line.
Later unlimited competition will !
prevail.
Leases for the ground, at an aver
age of $300 for business lots and
$120 anual rental for residence lots, '
will run to June, 1941. Applications j
for permits to do business will be j
received until June 30 of this year, i
No building will be possible until;
September or later, after streets j
1 have been paved and water mains |
and other service lines laid.
[ "Influence" Banned
Louis C. Cramton, special attorney {
in charge of the leasing for the In- j
terior Department, added a warn- j
ing that an£ applicant known to j
have paid for use of "supposed in- j
fluence" will not be considered.
"The purpose of the government \
in limiting the number of permits j
at this time," he said, "is to guard j
against the wholesale bankruptcy 1
which would otherwise result from j
the extravagant over development of:
the business district because of na
tion-wide interest in the project and i
plans based in many cases upon ;
: hopes rather than information. But
;it cannot assure anyone that the
limit is sufficiently low to guarantee j
success to all permittees or any."
Office in Las Vegas
Cramton is now on his way to Las
| Vegas, Nev., where the leasing office I
j will be conducted.
Business permits will be issued
only to American citizens.
Exempted from the limited com
petition class are automobile agen -:
cies, oil distributing agencies, banks,
j bus lines, telegraph or radio com
: panies. These will be required to
show equipment to handle the busi-
I ness or license from proper state or
federal agencies. National banks;
i only will be permitted.
