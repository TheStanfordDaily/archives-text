# LABOR PROBLEM BESETS SOVIET
## Liquor Causes Workers To Neglect Jobs 
### 
MOSCOW. May 17, (/P)â€” Marriage,
liquor, and labor now loom promi
nently among numerous handicaps
retarding successful completion of
the Soviet Union's five-year plan.
Although the government has in
creased the price and reduced the
supply of vodka, the famous and
potent Russian drink, the loss of
labor from excessive drinking ap
parently continues.
Many men buy a beetle of vodka
on their day off and next morning
fail to report for work. Thus they
are idle two days instead of one and
industry suffers.
To counteract this evil, factory
managements have been trying to
diccilpine heavy drinkers by with
holding privileges and dropping
them from payrolls, but the drink
ing continues.
Work at the great automobile
plant at Nijini Novgorod also was
said to be "unsatisfactory."
On the optimistic side of the ledger
the government is pointing out that
the Leningrad and Stalingrad plants
are producing more than 3,000 trac
tors monthly. It also is said collecti
vization of peasants now is over 50
per cent complete and that coal pro
duction steadily is increasing al
though still under schedule.
