GENEVA, May 17 (/P).—While the
rest of the international world rest
ed today, France in a memorandum
fired another volley at the Austro
i German plan for a customs union.
The memorandum, a summary of
the government's views of the prop
posed Austro-German trade agree- j
mcnt will be presented to the League ;
of Nations Council, which will dis- ;
cuss the project tomorrow. Oppo
sition to the move is based on three j
main grounds, as follows:
First, the customs union would I
compromise the economic independ- |
! ence of Austria and would thus en
i tail a compromise of her political in- .
dependence.
Second, it would create serious
difficulties over application of the
most favored nation clause and lead i
to denunciation of existing commer
cial treaties.
Third, presentation by Germany j
and Austria of the "fait accompli" !
is objectionable, constituting "nega- |
| tion of essential principles on which
| peace rests."
