# Bailey Raps 'Pampering' Of Lockout Regulations
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
The 10:30 lock-out rule, bear-trap
which clamps about the lagging an
kles of the Stanford woman, has
come in for significant criticism from
Dr. Margery Bailey of the English
department* acknowledged as one of
| the most perceptive women on the
i Stanford campus.
The early-bedtime gesture is but
one indication of a tendency in the
j University toward smothering the
individual and independent growth
of the college woman, keeping her
lacking in self-sufficiency.
A discouraging immaturity of col
| lege women, Dr. Bailey sees as the
outcome of university restriction.
I College should offer freedom for
women as i,t does successfully for
men—bringing about a natural re
gard for efficient conduct and self
control. Women of college age
should have poise and individuality
enough to manage their everyday
routine without the administrative
I spank, else they are not desirable

| Stanford material, in Dr. Bailey's
j opinion.
German universities offer a suc-
I cessful example of the college
i woman, unrestricted except for the
1 heavy ultimatum of "behave or get
out," as observed by Dr. Bailey in
a recent trip. German university
women, young, clear-eyed, and to
tally capable, were amused and in
credulous at the idea of being locked
up according to rules to insure their
I safety and satisfactory conduct,
i The moderh woman's first job is to
j be feminine and charming, asserts
j Dr. Bailey. This comes from fam
j ily environment and instinct. A sec
| ond requisite is that she be intelli-
I gent; and this is the task of the uni
i versity. To make the Stanford
j woman expert, fact-wise in any sub
! ject, is far from the aim of educa
tion. Intelligent, wide-awake, in
,tc rested persons human beings as
! apart from women—constitute the
i standard college product.
