# FEMININITY RULE HOLDS TOP REIN ON DAILY TODAY
## 
### 
ANCE again the feminine
journalists have shown their
literary perspicacity and gen
eral ability—these four pases
have proved that. The masthead
speaks truly.
Strange that the women's
edition of the Daily is not pink
or pnrplt—as was the custom
in the past—perhaps the white
sheets indicate that even the
"elite" 500 are advocating the
single standard.
In addition to this movement,
the sweeter TYFE-R woman
has demonstrated her ability to
become overnight FRANK, and
a few other people. When the
great Stanford public REIDS
this, there will be no DICK-er
ing about its faith in the effi
ciency and cleverness of Stan
ford women. No MOORE
proof is necessary.
