WASHINGTON, May 17 t/P).
Senator Goldsborough, Republican,
Maryland, and Representative Byrns,
Democrat, Tennessee, clashed today
in the capital's latest tariff contro
versy.
The Marylander ridiculed a pro
posal of Senator Hull, Democrat,
Tennessee, that the flexible provi
sion be repealed as a "threat of an
other general tariff revision." Byrns,
tanking Democrat on the House Ap
propriations Committee, blamed the
Hawley-Smoot Act for a large part
of the decline in American foreign
trade.
