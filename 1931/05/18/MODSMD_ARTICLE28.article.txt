# EASTMAN TIES QUARTER MILE WORLD RECORD
## Trojans Shatter Hopes For Indian Victory With 93 Point Score DYER PULLS LIGAMENT Nine Collegiate Records Fall In Contest 
### Betts Hawkins 
Ben Eastman, sensational sopho
more sophomore runner and one of
the greatest cinder artists developed
by Dink Templeton, made history
Saturday in the Pacific Intercolle
giates, although Stanford failed to
come through with a victory.
Equaling J. E. "Ted" Meredith's
official world's record for the quar
ter-mile run and leading Vic Wil
liams, National A.A.U. champion of
Southern California, to the tape
with a margin of four yards, Bang's
Eastman humbled a worthy com
petitor. His 47 2-5 second race
forced a frenzied 25,000 crowd of
spectators to their feet mad with
excitement and cheering both con
queror and loser.
Great Half-Miler
Established as the greatest inter
collegiate half-miler on the Pacific
Coast after his performance in the
P.A. meet at the Kezar Stadium
when he turned in a 1:53.0 time for
880, his record-breaking habit is no
new story.
Eastman's race will give sports
fans much to talk about in days lo
come, for it was the greatest quar
ter-mile ever staged on a Western
cinder path. Opening with his char
acteristic strong start, the blond
runner provided plenty of thrills
with his wonderful lead. It was a
spectacular finish with Vic Wil
liams crowding Eastman closely and
calling upon every ounce of energy
at his command in a desperate at
tempt to beat the sophomore flash
out at the tape.
Troy Wins
Dink Templeton's aggregation of
track men failed to conquer the in
vincible Trojan squad with Troy
piling up a score of 93 points against
the 49 points of Stanford and leav
ing 19 points for California and 2 for
U.C.L.A. •
Combination of circumstances
gave Dean Cromwell's men a help
ful push in gaining this astonishing
total against such strong competi
tion. Dink's pride and joy, Eastman,
didn't enter the half-mile, Smith's
absence in the hurdles was disas
trous for Card points, and Dyer's
leg injury kept him out of the 220.
Records Fall
Nine collegiate records fell in a
meet spattered with breath-taking
finishes. Wykoff's thriller in the
100-yard dash tying Eddie Tolan's
acknowledged world's record of 1.5
was second in interest only to East
man's battle with Williams.
The two - mile race, in which
Mossman of California dueled with
Callahan and Unruh of Southern
California, was another high-light of
the meet. Mossman's final spring,
however, was too much for the Tro
jan gentlemen, who fell back giving
Mossman the race in the time of
9:39.4, a new meet record. Aeber
sold finally lost fourth place to Gar
dener of S.C.
Relay Wins
Stanford's world's record relay
team, hardly even pushed by the
Trojans, won easily in the respec
table time of 3:15.2, with California
coming in for a poor but plucky
third. Fitzmaurice taking advantage
of Eastman's absence in the 880 set
a new meet record of 1:55.4 to win
i handily.

Ben Eastman, sensational sopho
more sophomore runner and one of
the greatest cinder artists developed
by Dink Templeton, made history
Saturday in the Pacific Intercolle
giates, although Stanford failed to
come through with a victory.
Equaling J. E. "Ted" Meredith's
official world's record for the quar
ter-mile run and leading Vic Wil
liams, National A.A.U. champion of
Southern California, to the tape
with a margin of four yards, Bang's
Eastman humbled a worthy com
petitor. His 47 2-5 second race
forced a frenzied 25,000 crowd of
spectators to their feet mad with
excitement and cheering both con
queror and loser.
Great Half-Miler
Established as the greatest inter
collegiate half-miler on the Pacific
Coast after his performance in the
P.A. meet at the Kezar Stadium
when he turned in a 1:53.0 time for
880, his record-breaking habit is no
new story.
Eastman's race will give sports
fans much to talk about in days lo
come, for it was the greatest quar
ter-mile ever staged on a Western
cinder path. Opening with his char
acteristic strong start, the blond
runner provided plenty of thrills
with his wonderful lead. It was a
spectacular finish with Vic Wil
liams crowding Eastman closely and
calling upon every ounce of energy
at his command in a desperate at
tempt to beat the sophomore flash
out at the tape.
Troy Wins
Dink Templeton's aggregation of
track men failed to conquer the in
vincible Trojan squad with Troy
piling up a score of 93 points against
the 49 points of Stanford and leav
ing 19 points for California and 2 for
U.C.L.A. •
Combination of circumstances
gave Dean Cromwell's men a help
ful push in gaining this astonishing
total against such strong competi
tion. Dink's pride and joy, Eastman,
didn't enter the half-mile, Smith's
absence in the hurdles was disas
trous for Card points, and Dyer's
leg injury kept him out of the 220.
Records Fall
Nine collegiate records fell in a
meet spattered with breath-taking
finishes. Wykoff's thriller in the
100-yard dash tying Eddie Tolan's
acknowledged world's record of 1.5
was second in interest only to East
man's battle with Williams.
The two - mile race, in which
Mossman of California dueled with
Callahan and Unruh of Southern
California, was another high-light of
the meet. Mossman's final spring,
however, was too much for the Tro
jan gentlemen, who fell back giving

Ben Eastman, sensational sopho
more sophomore runner and one of
the greatest cinder artists developed
by Dink Templeton, made history
Saturday in the Pacific Intercolle
giates, although Stanford failed to
come through with a victory.
Equaling J. E. "Ted" Meredith's
official world's record for the quar
ter-mile run and leading Vic Wil
liams, National A.A.U. champion of
Southern California, to the tape
with a margin of four yards, Bang's
Eastman humbled a worthy com
petitor. His 47 2-5 second race
forced a frenzied 25,000 crowd of
spectators to their feet mad with
excitement and cheering both con
queror and loser.
Great Half-Miler
Established as the greatest inter
collegiate half-miler on the Pacific
Coast after his performance in the
P.A. meet at the Kezar Stadium
when he turned in a 1:53.0 time for
880, his record-breaking habit is no
new story.
Eastman's race will give sports
fans much to talk about in days lo
come, for it was the greatest quar
ter-mile ever staged on a Western
cinder path. Opening with his char
acteristic strong start, the blond
runner provided plenty of thrills
with his wonderful lead. It was a
spectacular finish with Vic Wil
liams crowding Eastman closely and
calling upon every ounce of energy
at his command in a desperate at
tempt to beat the sophomore flash
out at the tape.
Troy Wins
Dink Templeton's aggregation of
track men failed to conquer the in
vincible Trojan squad with Troy
piling up a score of 93 points against
the 49 points of Stanford and leav
ing 19 points for California and 2 for
U.C.L.A. •
Combination of circumstances
gave Dean Cromwell's men a help
ful push in gaining this astonishing
total against such strong competi
tion. Dink's pride and joy, Eastman,
didn't enter the half-mile, Smith's
absence in the hurdles was disas
trous for Card points, and Dyer's
leg injury kept him out of the 220.
Records Fall
Nine collegiate records fell in a
meet spattered with breath-taking
finishes. Wykoff's thriller in the
100-yard dash tying Eddie Tolan's
acknowledged world's record of 1.5
was second in interest only to East
man's battle with Williams.
The two - mile race, in which
Mossman of California dueled with
Callahan and Unruh of Southern
California, was another high-light of
the meet. Mossman's final spring,
however, was too much for the Tro
jan gentlemen, who fell back giving
Mossman the race in the time of
9:39.4, a new meet record. Aeber
sold finally lost fourth place to Gar
dener of S.C.
Relay Wins
Stanford's world's record relay
team, hardly even pushed by the
Trojans, won easily in the respec
table time of 3:15.2, with California
coming in for a poor but plucky
third. Fitzmaurice taking advantage
of Eastman's absence in the 880 set
a new meet record of 1:55.4 to win
i handily.

acteristic strong start, the blond
runner provided plenty of thrills
with his wonderful lead. It was a
spectacular finish with Vic Wil
liams crowding Eastman closely and
calling upon every ounce of energy
at his command in a desperate at
tempt to beat the sophomore flash
out at the tape.
Troy Wins
Dink Templeton's aggregation of
track men failed to conquer the in
vincible Trojan squad with Troy
piling up a score of 93 points against
the 49 points of Stanford and leav
ing 19 points for California and 2 for
U.C.L.A. •
Combination of circumstances
gave Dean Cromwell's men a help
ful push in gaining this astonishing
total against such strong competi
tion. Dink's pride and joy, Eastman,
didn't enter the half-mile, Smith's
absence in the hurdles was disas
trous for Card points, and Dyer's
leg injury kept him out of the 220.
Records Fall
Nine collegiate records fell in a
meet spattered with breath-taking
finishes. Wykoff's thriller in the
100-yard dash tying Eddie Tolan's
acknowledged world's record of 1.5
was second in interest only to East
man's battle with Williams.
The two - mile race, in which
Mossman of California dueled with
Callahan and Unruh of Southern
California, was another high-light of
the meet. Mossman's final spring,
however, was too much for the Tro
jan gentlemen, who fell back giving
Mossman the race in the time of
9:39.4, a new meet record. Aeber
sold finally lost fourth place to Gar
dener of S.C.
Relay Wins
Stanford's world's record relay
team, hardly even pushed by the
Trojans, won easily in the respec
table time of 3:15.2, with California
coming in for a poor but plucky
third. Fitzmaurice taking advantage
of Eastman's absence in the 880 set
a new meet record of 1:55.4 to win
i handily.

Ben Eastman, sensational sopho
more sophomore runner and one of
the greatest cinder artists developed
by Dink Templeton, made history
Saturday in the Pacific Intercolle
giates, although Stanford failed to
come through with a victory.
Equaling J. E. "Ted" Meredith's
official world's record for the quar
ter-mile run and leading Vic Wil
liams, National A.A.U. champion of
Southern California, to the tape
with a margin of four yards, Bang's
Eastman humbled a worthy com
petitor. His 47 2-5 second race
forced a frenzied 25,000 crowd of
spectators to their feet mad with
excitement and cheering both con
queror and loser.
Great Half-Miler
Established as the greatest inter
collegiate half-miler on the Pacific
Coast after his performance in the
P.A. meet at the Kezar Stadium
when he turned in a 1:53.0 time for
880, his record-breaking habit is no
new story.
Eastman's race will give sports
fans much to talk about in days lo
come, for it was the greatest quar
ter-mile ever staged on a Western
cinder path. Opening with his char
acteristic strong start, the blond
runner provided plenty of thrills
with his wonderful lead. It was a
spectacular finish with Vic Wil
liams crowding Eastman closely and
