# VITALIZING WOMEN'S ATHLETICS
## 
### 
Foremost anions Ihe ideals of any movement toward
physical education in college is I lie aim io get every person
inleresled in some form of athletics. To accomplish this,
there must he a forceful stimulus for participation. For
the majority of women, however, a course in physical edu
cation is little end in itself and college students of the gen
eral run are physically lazv. Hut to have some goal, some
end that is the need.
In pre-war days, Stanford used to have a real incentive
for athletic interest among the women. That was inter
collegiate varsity competition, with Mills College and the
I'nivcrsily of California as rivals.
Thirteen years ago, the Women's Athletic Association
joined the Athletic Conference of American College
Women which expressed itself as opposed to intercolle
giate competition for women. In 1!I2I, when the Confer
ence met at the I'niversity of California, that college plus
Stanford and Mills presented the plan of competition they
had used with great success for several years.
Their method consisted in having interclass intercolle
giate competition in basketball, hockey, tennis, and fenc
ing, during the season of each of those sports.
Hut the Conference's reply to the proposal of Ibis kind
of rivalry was a vole for the addition of the phrase "of any
type" to the statement objecting to intercollegiate compe
tition. The combination of this act, plus the fact that Cali
fornia was the hostess, forbade making any remonstrance.
Since that time, the three colleges have conducted an
annual Triangular Sports Day. At that time, each class
has one team made up of a certain number of women from
each of the three colleges, and at the end of the day one
class is declared victor in each sport of the tive in which
competition of this kind is held: swimming, basketball,
hockev, tennis, and archery.

Where members of the same team have never seen each
other until ten minutes before the game starts, not even
the keenest athlete could enjoy a sport. What possible in
centive would Triangular Sports Day offer?
The stimulus of intramural competition has been tried
and found wanting in real results few women even know
about it, and fewer care. Competition between living
groups would be a farce, due to the unevenness in size and
the result of widening gaps between groups.
The best solution to the problem of vitalizing the ath
letic program seems to be in renewing interclass intercol
legiate sports.
Wrangling is uppermost in the minds of most of those
who object to intercollegiate competition — but are not
(hose objectors willing to give to the sportsmanship they
are nurturing so carefully behind the closed doors of the
gymnasium some chance to prove its existence on the field
in intercollegiate competition?
The greatest obstacle which stands in Stanford's way is
membership in the Athletic Conference of American Col
lege Women. Hut the Conference's expression of disap
proval of intercollegiate is merely a "sentiment."
The purpose of membership in the Athletic Conference
of American College Women has been interchange of ideas
at the national conventions held every three years and at
the sectional meetings every year. Conventions, il must be
admitted, are useful to the one or two people who attend
but do the groups represented really benefit by the new
ideas collected?
If membership prevents a broadening of those larger
groups, why does il exist? Many colleges in the East, con
sidered progressive, are not members. The information
received at the conventions should be a part ol the depart
ment members' jobs in keeping in touch with their work
at other institutions.
In the case of interclass against varsity competition,
those women who have only mediocre training would lose
interest ;is soon as only nine could get on a team, but inter
class intercollegiate competition solves fliis by giving four
times that number flic opportunity to make teams.
As for competitors, many junior colleges and others
would be glad to meet Stanford on the athletic field: San
.lose, Siin Mateo, College of the Pacific. Mills has shown
itself to be in favor of a revision in the matter of Triangu
lar Sports Day and the t niversity of California might
consider instituting a more stimulating type of competition.
Next year's executive board of the Women's Athletic
Association to be installed this month lins its work cut out
for it. It is up to that board to reintroduce interclass inter
collegiate competition for women ;ind vitalize women's
athletics.

In pre-war days, Stanford used to have a real incentive

Thirteen years ago, the Women's Athletic Association
joined the Athletic Conference of American College
Women which expressed itself as opposed to intercolle

Stanford and Mills presented the plan of competition they
had used with great success for several years.
Their method consisted in having interclass intercolle
giate competition in basketball, hockey, tennis, and fenc

Hut the Conference's reply to the proposal of Ibis kind
of rivalry was a vole for the addition of the phrase "of any

Since that time, the three colleges have conducted an

competition of this kind is held: swimming, basketball,
