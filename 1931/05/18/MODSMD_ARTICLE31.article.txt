THE CRUSADERS
The Daily Princetonian
"The Crusaders propose to keep
up an incessant struggle until there
has been substituted for the 18th
Amendment a program which will
make temperance a moral, rather
than legal, issue; a program which
will positively ban the return of the
saloon, but which will restore to the
people the liberty that the Consti
tution guaranteed them." And this
week in Princeton an undergraduate
committee of Crusaders is opening
a four-day drive for membership
which deserves the support of every
student who is conscientiously con
vinced of Prohibition's hopeless in
adequacy.
The Princetonian has previously
pointed out that while "true temper
ance" is unquestionably desired, the
present systepi of governmental in
terference in private conduct has
completely failed to effect such a
condition. It is hardly necessary to
suggest to 2,200 young men, aware
as they are of the number of speak
easies, "cordial shops," and second
floor "restaurants" in every city and
town of the country, that those who
find blessings in the 18th Amend
ment have restricted their investi
gations to the publications of the
Methodist Board of Temperance and
Morals. And with the complete fail
ure of Prohibition to prohibit, comes
a host of other evils: nearly three
billion dollars, spent annually for
liquor, go to the support of criminals
rather than to the increase of gov
ernment revenues; the terrific cost
of ineffectual enforcement drains the
Treasury and the taxpayer; and,
unquestionably the most serious
consequence, social sanction for the
violation of one law engenders in
young citizens disregard, il' not con
tempt, for the whole body of laws
which govern civil life. It is plainly
time for some sort of change.
That this is the opinion of the
Campus at large was indicated in
the poll conducted last spring, when
only 22 out of 1872 students ex
pressed satisfaction with the present
state of affairs. Yet, the remaining
98.9 per cent, sunk in unintelligent
indifference and moral inertia, wet
and drys alike, passively continue
to tolerate what they condemn. In
one to four years, each undergradu
ate will be taking his place in civil
life and, as a member of the edu
cated class, he will be expected to
show that informed interest and ac
tive participation on which the suc
cess of democratic citizenship de
pends. Future voters cannot face
important issues too soon. Member
ship in The Crusaders offers an op
portunity for activity to those stu
dents who see a solution for ihe
present muddle in repeal of the 18th
Amendment and the return of state
option.

Amendment a program which will
make temperance a moral, rather
than legal, issue; a program which
will positively ban the return of the
saloon, but which will restore to the
people the liberty that the Consti
tution guaranteed them." And this

committee of Crusaders is opening

student who is conscientiously con
vinced of Prohibition's hopeless in

The Princetonian has previously
pointed out that while "true temper
ance" is unquestionably desired, the
present systepi of governmental in
terference in private conduct has
completely failed to effect such a
condition. It is hardly necessary to
suggest to 2,200 young men, aware
as they are of the number of speak
easies, "cordial shops," and second
floor "restaurants" in every city and
town of the country, that those who
find blessings in the 18th Amend
ment have restricted their investi
gations to the publications of the
Methodist Board of Temperance and
Morals. And with the complete fail
ure of Prohibition to prohibit, comes
a host of other evils: nearly three
billion dollars, spent annually for
liquor, go to the support of criminals
rather than to the increase of gov
ernment revenues; the terrific cost
of ineffectual enforcement drains the
Treasury and the taxpayer; and,
unquestionably the most serious
consequence, social sanction for the
violation of one law engenders in
young citizens disregard, il' not con
tempt, for the whole body of laws
which govern civil life. It is plainly
time for some sort of change.
That this is the opinion of the
Campus at large was indicated in
the poll conducted last spring, when
only 22 out of 1872 students ex
pressed satisfaction with the present
state of affairs. Yet, the remaining
98.9 per cent, sunk in unintelligent
indifference and moral inertia, wet
and drys alike, passively continue
to tolerate what they condemn. In
one to four years, each undergradu
ate will be taking his place in civil
life and, as a member of the edu
cated class, he will be expected to
show that informed interest and ac
tive participation on which the suc
cess of democratic citizenship de
pends. Future voters cannot face
important issues too soon. Member
ship in The Crusaders offers an op

dents who see a solution for ihe
present muddle in repeal of the 18th
Amendment and the return of state
option.
