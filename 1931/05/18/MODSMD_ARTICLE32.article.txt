# EDITORIAL STAFF WINS Daily Ball Teams Combat SCORE 14-7 CONQUEST
## 
### 
Winning the annual baseball joust
yesterday for the first time in jour
nalistic history, t,he Stanford Daily
editorial staff swung, ran, skidded,
and swished its way to victory over
the Daily's business staff with a
spectacular score of 14-7.
Opening with a no-hit inning, the
game ripened steadily under con
sistently agile teamwork of the ink
slingers. Second inning ragg up a
5 to 1 count, and by the fourth
round the penny-pinchers, goaded
by the mounting runs of their rivals,
had been frightened into stretching
their legs in four journeys across
the home plate.
Editmen Active
Sustained activity from the edit
men fattened the score during sub
sequent innings. Then a final come
back attempt by the financiers in
the last sensational minutes of play
sandwiched two runs between two
outs, and climaxed the flashy game
in its fifty per cent defeat, the front
page men carrying the bats of vic
tory off the field.
Friendlich and Crawford, battery
for the colyumnists, kept up a cor
respondence between mound and
plate that can be characterized only
as "nifty." Hardy for the ad-snatch
ers put up the liveliest interference
amid these two. Bishop, starting at
infield, showed his versatility by
turning penny-pitcher in the latter
half of the game, to deliver a few
good curves to the editmen. Thomp
son, Coit, and Kendall were among
the less-asleep of the ad-mongers.
Dreyfus Original
Moore's gyrations at left field drew
applause from the campus wits and
gratitude from the opposing admen.
Consistently original play was of
fered throughout by Dreyfus, who
totaled the sick-list at the end of
the game by utter collapse and a
twisted neck.
Charges of subsidy were made
against each team by the other im
mediately after the game. Suspicion
among the bleachers rested with the
business men, and an investigation is
reported under way to discover how
much was paid the umpire by the
manager of the Daily funds.
