## ALUMNAE AND THE WOMEN'S GYM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
At the present time, one of the j
most pressing demands upon the
alumnae presents itself in the form |
of an only partially furnished worn- j
en's gymnasium. Even in answer to
this call for aid, only a few friends
of the University and parents of
freshmen women have responded.
Probably more than three thou
sand alumnae have carried away
from Stanford degrees of which they
were justly proud. Of that num
ber, how many have contributed to
Stanford's support in any way? j
While attending the University, they |
have paid one-third of what their
education here is really worth.
Granted that voluntary giving is
not a common occurrence—mainly
because we're all so thoughtless—
there are times when even the most
thoughtless would contribute to a
cause.
The same people give to every
organization asking aid, not be- j
cause they have more money than
those who do not give, but because j
they are more interested in the Uni- j
versity.
It seems strange that the prospect j
of having a fully furnished, modern i
gymnasium for the women, a proj
ect that has been worked at for!
some thirty years, would not inter- J
est more of the women who have
fought for the replacement of thej
"temporary building" during that;
long period.
If alumnae need prodding, then it
is up to someone to do it. Surely
they care enough for Stanford to:
give their support if it were solici- |
ted.
The appeal for the women's gym
nasium furnishing fund seems to!
show that we lack help when it is
needed!
Sincerely,
