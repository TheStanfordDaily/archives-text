# HERE'S TO ARMED PACIFISM

### 
' The Editor, Sir:
Last week Mr. Robqrt C. Osborne
| Jr. was foolish enough to bite on my
I bait, and as act of pure courtesy I
iam reciprocating and obliging Mr.
I Osborne by biting on his bait.
1 We both know and agree that
I there is something radically wrong
' with armed conflict and yet he in
! sists on ignoring the problem. I
| take a step; it may be in the wrong
j direction, but he takes no step at
! all and condemns me.
! Mr. Osborne, try living for today;
j the situation is here, so face the
j facts.
Mr. Osborne is absolutely right in
his idea that we need an intelligent
public opinion. Public opinion is
fine, but it cannot be established
when rival commercial interests are
intent, and always will be intent, on
; collecting the Almighty Dollar. Thus,
| you see, Mr. Osborne, your work is
clearly cut out for you. You have a
mission to perform in this world,
i You can scratch the world out of its
j itching palm. While you are doing
J your scratching, please let the mili
j tarists keep their pop guns so that
| they can defend you along with the
| rest of the pacifists. Never throw
1 away dirty water until you get clean
; water.
Just because the militarists plan
bigger and better guns, it does not
| stand to reason that they are plan
! ning bigger and better wars. They
I must do something to justify the sal
j aries that your supporters pay them.
After all a soldier has a conscience.
It is really unsporting of the paci
| fists to put the militarists under the
i terrible handicap and unfair advan
tage of expecting them to train and
get in two blows at the same time.
If another war should come (God
grant that it won't) I know that I
will find Mr. Osborne by my side,
for his Peace League will see that
he is there to protect it.
I see no reason why the militarists
I should leave the saddle and quit as
long as they know that they can do
the job better than the pacifists. Mr.
Osborne, my system works under
fire and strife, yours does not, therc
| fore you should be a good boy and
j follow our lead.

' The Editor, Sir:
Last week Mr. Robqrt C. Osborne
| Jr. was foolish enough to bite on my
I bait, and as act of pure courtesy I
iam reciprocating and obliging Mr.
I Osborne by biting on his bait.
1 We both know and agree that
I there is something radically wrong
' with armed conflict and yet he in
! sists on ignoring the problem. I
| take a step; it may be in the wrong
j direction, but he takes no step at
! all and condemns me.
! Mr. Osborne, try living for today;
j the situation is here, so face the
j facts.
Mr. Osborne is absolutely right in
his idea that we need an intelligent
public opinion. Public opinion is
fine, but it cannot be established
when rival commercial interests are
intent, and always will be intent, on
; collecting the Almighty Dollar. Thus,
| you see, Mr. Osborne, your work is
clearly cut out for you. You have a
mission to perform in this world,
i You can scratch the world out of its
j itching palm. While you are doing
J your scratching, please let the mili
j tarists keep their pop guns so that
| they can defend you along with the
| rest of the pacifists. Never throw
1 away dirty water until you get clean
; water.
Just because the militarists plan
bigger and better guns, it does not
| stand to reason that they are plan
! ning bigger and better wars. They
I must do something to justify the sal
j aries that your supporters pay them.
After all a soldier has a conscience.
