"The 500"—God bless it. Like the
name of the Stanford rough, it lends
| itself to jouiTialistie embroidery. It
I provides the spice to Stanford
i legend. It is a favorite stamping
-1 ground of college discussionists. It
is the chief piece de resistance of
j campus humorists, and a delectable
morsel of prey for city tabloids. It
! is the shrine for a good deal of sen
j timentality, and the recipient of
I some censure.
All this "the 500"—not Stanford
| women, nor A.W.S., nor that gentler
portion of the A.S.S.U.—but the
I glorified, publicized, over-empha
-1 sized 500. Springing as a self-evident
' parody on the New York bluebook,
it has brought along a ■ flavor of
J prestige from its source.
But pushing aside the blurb, there
remains a shred of granite fact lor
which 500 Stanford women offer a
| clumsily expressed gratitude. This
fact: that Stanford women receive
more sincere gallantry at the hands
of Stanford men—howbeit in their
traditionally rough manner—than is
j the lot of women of any other co
i educational institution in the United
; States.
Part of this arises from the "500"
saga, the half-humorous halo that
I has been set up around the Stanford
' women—a handful of women in an
: army of men—Mrs. Stanford's idea
of sweetening the porridge with a
: few grains of sugar—Stanford, the
i softest place in the world, where
woman is sure to have six men at
her command, or Stanford—where j
! there are just enough women to i
I bring restrictions and destroy the J

[ atmosphere of an otherwise distinct
ly man's university.
No matter which facet of the di
| verse legend shines most convinc
! ingly, the result is the same—atten-
I tion directed toward the Stanford
! woman, scrutinies made of her, con
! elusions hazarded, psychology in
j terpreted, yarns elaborated, ques
i tions rehashed. As the "500," she
i becomes a motivating power about
' the campus, an interesting, abstract
| entity, a mystery, a problem, a
charming joke.
Publicity brings its back-kick in
, the "import" propaganda, the ugly
! duckling doctrine, and the tenets of
i emancipated roughdom. But the fact
remains that 85 per cent of Stanford
! women are married by Stanford
men; and that Stanford-made mar
| tiage shows a negligible divorce rate.
Marriage is not boasted as the
supreme evidence of caramadene
between the 500 and Stanford men.
Most to be exalted is the fact that
I Stanford women are not "the girls."
i They escape being ranked with the
opprobious "co-ed" who throngs the
corridors of our great state univer
sities, rubbing snuggling shoulders
with her fellow collegians. Stan
ford's women are not treated with
| the casual boredom accorded
: U.C.L.A.'s overwhelming female
i numbers, nor the smirking, tongue
in-cheek attitude given the isolated
gentle-ladies across the bay. Instead,
"the 500," as such, is a myth apart,
unapproachable, original, an intan
; gible something toward which men
j can and do direct, however they
; strive to conceal it, a certain rare,
j and appreciated, attention.

All this "the 500"—not Stanford

portion of the A.S.S.U.—but the
I glorified, publicized, over-empha

it has brought along a ■ flavor of

But pushing aside the blurb, there

which 500 Stanford women offer a

fact: that Stanford women receive
more sincere gallantry at the hands
of Stanford men—howbeit in their
traditionally rough manner—than is
j the lot of women of any other co

Part of this arises from the "500"
saga, the half-humorous halo that
I has been set up around the Stanford
' women—a handful of women in an
: army of men—Mrs. Stanford's idea
of sweetening the porridge with a
: few grains of sugar—Stanford, the
i softest place in the world, where
woman is sure to have six men at

No matter which facet of the di

j terpreted, yarns elaborated, ques
i tions rehashed. As the "500," she
i becomes a motivating power about
' the campus, an interesting, abstract
| entity, a mystery, a problem, a
charming joke.
Publicity brings its back-kick in
, the "import" propaganda, the ugly
! duckling doctrine, and the tenets of
i emancipated roughdom. But the fact
remains that 85 per cent of Stanford
! women are married by Stanford
men; and that Stanford-made mar

Marriage is not boasted as the
supreme evidence of caramadene
between the 500 and Stanford men.
Most to be exalted is the fact that
I Stanford women are not "the girls."
i They escape being ranked with the
opprobious "co-ed" who throngs the
corridors of our great state univer
sities, rubbing snuggling shoulders
with her fellow collegians. Stan
ford's women are not treated with

: U.C.L.A.'s overwhelming female
i numbers, nor the smirking, tongue
in-cheek attitude given the isolated
gentle-ladies across the bay. Instead,
"the 500," as such, is a myth apart,
unapproachable, original, an intan

j can and do direct, however they
