MORNING TIDE—By Neil M. Gunn. i
New York: Harcourt, Brace. 1931. !
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"Morning Tide" is a cross-section
on the life, not only of Hugh Mac- i
beth's family, but of "the Scotch
fishing village in which they lived, i
j Through the preceptuous eyes of
! Hugh's boyhood sensitiveness to !
j emotional intensity, the details of I
. i his life are heightened to individual 1
! significance.
j In the hilarity of poaching with
! his elder brother, the departure of
| that same brother for Australia, the ;
I tense struggle of the fishermen, j
i among whom was Hugh's father, to j
j reach safety through the worst storm 1
of village history and legend, the I
| love of his sisters for the same man, !
his own day in school, his mother's
near death—Neil Gunn has fused a j
I normal boy's life with mature in
cidents, so that a reader sees them \
'in two ways—for himself, and
through the boy's eyes.
The combination cffects true real- I
ity. And something more—sympathy j
i without sentiment, and a simplicity I

I
! that is pleasurable and worth while
! reading. —J.N.
DAYBREAK—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Ramon Novarro, having a flare for
i romantic parts to begin with, has
' managed, by being allowed plenty
: of gay comedy, to make a really en
! tertaining picture out of the old set
ting of Imperial Guards, wine gar
! dens, and the obligations of an of
j fleer and a gentleman in paying
i gambling debts.
; The comedy is mostly Novarro
i himself, self-p®ssessed, persistent,
| and undeniably light-hearted. As
! sisted by that not much-heralded
1 but charming actress, Helen Chand
' ler, the plot centers around an of
; fleer's desire to marry whom he
i pleases, in spite of court decrees. In
the end he wins the consent of his
uncle-General. One expects that, and
• even though his announced fiancee
; is casually forgotten, because it is a
■ romance, one forgives, and decides
! that such is not amiss if it occui's
I at long intervals. —J.N.
