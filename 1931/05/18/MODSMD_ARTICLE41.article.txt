The movement toward peace and
law is but a part of the larger move
ment of democracy, the movement
toward the valuation of the indi
vidual man. Under democracy, the
man is no longer the property of
the state, to be coddled or manhan
dled as its officials decree. The state
exists for the benefit of the indi
vidual men. Its officials are the ser
vants of the people. By co-operation,
men can secure the chief benefits a
state can give, without sacrifice of
their own freedom. These are mainly
justice, peace, education, and sani
tation. When the state attempts to
secure more than these for a part
of its citizens, it must correspond
ingly oppress the others. The privi
lege of Ihe few is the burden of the
many.—War and Waste.

Insurance for the unemployed is
being considered by the Canadian,
government.
