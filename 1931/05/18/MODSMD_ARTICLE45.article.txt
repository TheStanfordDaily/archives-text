Why waste words when women
work wonders with winged writ
ings? Weak, wobbly women whim
per, wonder why, while wily women
wink at the world, wrangle wisely
with wandering wit, wrest wisdom,
and wage wrathy war on wretched,
wistful wastrels.
Wrinkled women, winsome
women, women wiggling, writh
ing, wild, woolly, wholesome,
weeping wives or widows,
wheedling, wee, witching or
washouts, we want women. (And
we want what we want when
we want it.)
Dedicated to a junior transfer, a
poor fish who is the Sole of Sophis
tication.
Did you know, by the way, that
all men are weaklings, and can't
stand long, straight stretches of work
the way women can? So this is the
women's edition, while THEY make
themselves strong (beer-strength)
and hope to wake up by Wednes
day.
There was also a track meet,
this week-end, which Stanford
did not win, for a good many
feeble reasons. Worst is that
Dyer strained a ligament. Bet
his muscles sho-al hurt! Hector!
That's a lousy pun. but who
gives a damn? (Boy, that's sling
ing 'em.)
And the poetry for today—some
thing for the Stanford woman. Epi
taph to do something, I can do it—
I wandered lonely as a prude
In ever lengthening punsive mood
Toyon gave lis a chance to see
just how funny college men can
be, Friday night. Still think the
B.A.C. ought to provide curtains
for the rooms on the court, over
there. We believe in physical
culture, yes, hut now there's a
women's gymnasium.
Rose week in San Jose . . . Fiesta
lady what she did at the carnival,
she'd answer, "Festival we We
went for a ride in the breeze. It
was a knight airant . . ."
May, and more sunburn for
the five-hundred. Sorority row
is just an old "swomen hole,"
after all.

There were a couple of other
mentionable dances on campus Fri
day, too. The cow jumped over the
original moon at the Sigma Nu
house, bounced on the Tri Delt roof
(oh, is that what happened?) and
landed in the middle of a Quart-et
of Kappa Swigs.
Most of these rough people
learned to dance by Marking
time at the Hop-Kins. Tan-y-go
with me sometime, Theodora?
And so to our eight o'clock glass
