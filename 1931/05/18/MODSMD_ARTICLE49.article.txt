For many years, women of the
'iuious co-educational universities
iave complained long and laborious
y against restrictions—restrictions
n particular against their comings
nd their goings in the late hours
f the night. Here at Stanford, after
lattering against a bulwark of fac
tity denial for complete abolition
f the lock-out rulings, the women's
■aders eventually received a divir.e
ispiration. They compromised. Now,
vith the health, scholarship, and
thical stability of the Stanford
voman still in good order, all goes
/.11.
Up and down the coast and
once again at Stanford, women
have been engaged in valiant
combat for a more stimulating
form of competition in women's
athletics. Field Days, Triangular
Sports Days, interclass contests
—all these have been found
wanting, and the cry has gone
lip for intercollegiate competi
tion. Development of women's
sports at Stanford has been slow.
Interest in some sports has
lagged to such an extent, be
causa of poor equipment and the
thoroughly lackadaisical manner
of carrying through a definite
sports program, that the best
players pf the sport have re
fused to participate in YV.A.A.
activities.
Graduating alumnae cannot be ex
»ected to give money toward new
quipment and to the new gymna
ium if it will only result in build
ng facilities for the furtherance of
he same dull attitude toward ath
etics. It is up to Stanford women
o provide some stimulating force in
he interest of athletics. W.A.A. is at
ast making constructive steps to
ward just such an end. Mrs. Helen
Vills Moody will appear this week
:i two exhibition matches sponsored
>y the women's sport organization,
'his may be read as an indication
!' interest in competitive athletics.
/Irs. Moody is obviously not a play
r developed by the annual partiei
laiion in the thrilling Triangular
■ports Days.
Any one of a half-dozen ten
nis players has the potentiali
ties to develop into national
tournament material if she were
encouraged by the impetus of
competition and some systematic
training. Why should they be
denied this opportunity? Re
cently one of the most drastic
changes in the department was
made inaugurating a competi
tive tennis class. There is 110
reason to warrant stopping af
ter (his improvement.
Fencing is the outstanding exam
le of the one sport for which all
latural enthusiasm of the partici
pants has not been dulled. Al
hough one of the latest added to
he curriculum it is the one sport
,'hich a Stanford woman has been
llowed to enter outside competi
ion as a representative from this
Iniversity.
True enough, the competition was
ot listed as intercollegiate, but the
ne of such a distinction between
hat and a southern divisional tour
ey is too fine to quibble over.
Admittance of archers into
the national telegraphic compe
tition has been granted this
year. One woman recently
turned in a score which, if it
had been officially recorded,
would have given her one of the
highest awards possible to at
tain in any archery meet. Here
tofore regarded as an impos
sibility, this year a golf tourna
ment. which promises to bring
into prominence a golfer who
can play the course in record
stroking, has been arranged.
W.A.A. points will be awarded
as in any other sport.
