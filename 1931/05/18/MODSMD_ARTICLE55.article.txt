# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE SCRIMMAGE PUTS STAR VARSITY HALF ON CRUTCHES
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Spring football practice in the in
: timacy of the practice field took on
: a Big Game savor Friday when two
of Pop Warner's informal elevens
j flung themselves together in a clash
! that will put Phil Moffatt on crutch-
I es for the rest of the quarter.
The flashy halfback, running up
i from the backfield, caught in a
j straight tackle, twisted as he fell,
j and cracked the fibula bone of his
! leg, an injury which will keep him
I from further practice tjiis spring,
' but will not jeopardize his chances
j next October.
j "More deception with the same
i power" is next season's promise
from Tiny Thornhill, line coach,
who helped Pop Warner drill the
spring gridsters in "all new stuff"
at Friday's practice. Every play has
been changed, variations of last sea
son's plays making an effective dis
guise of 1930-brand offensive,
i City sports editors who elicited
| from Howard Jones the roster of

j U.S.C.'s next teams have persuaded
Pop Warner into giving two pos
i sible Stanford line-ups, taken from
present available mateiial:
Marks C Bates
1 Hulen LG Scribner
; Corbus RG White
Ehrhorn RT Gribbin
Hand LT Prelsnik
; Colvin LE Neill
Clark RE Doub
I Rintala RH Warren
I Moffatt LIT Campbell
Hillman Q Targhetta
i Caddel F Allen or Baker
Freshman prospects hold the cus
! tomary ratio, Thornhill declared,
i believing that four or five freshmen
: will tread the short route to gridiron
; opportunity. He suggested Maentz
; and Topping.
Campbeil, Red Hand, Glover, and
Phil Neill showed activity in Fri
; day's practice, the blond endsman
â–  stretching his workout over three
| quarters of the game.
