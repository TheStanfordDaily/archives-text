# INDIAN POLO FOUR TROUNCE QUARTET OF OREGON STATE
## Win Gives Stanford Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Polo Championship 
### 
Riding over Oregon State College,
G to 4, Saturday, Stanford's polo
quartet snatched the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Championship from
the outstretched hands of the Beaver
squad.
Pete Lewis, playing No. 2, was the
outstanding rider in the game as
reported in a telegram to Lieuten
ant-Colonel D. C. Cubbison. Several
of his long shots cleared the way for
Stanford goals whiles his defensive
game stopped the northern team
from scoring more than once.
Boothe, Star Player
This tilt was the second of a two
game series, the first having resulted
in an Indian win by a 7 to 3 score.
Pod Boothe proved to be Stanford's
stellar man in the first contest.
Corvallis placed practically the
same team on the field which de
cisively trounced the Cardinals hist
year. Although Stanford poloists
were playing with the added diffi
culties of strange mounts and un
known field they made a more than
creditable showing. Only half of tiie
team members are first-string men
from last quarter which prophesies a
successful season for next year when
they will have gained more experi
ence through outside competition.
Teamwork Improved
Excellent progress in teamwork
has been shown in this year's team,
according to Captain Gordon, and
the games have been notably free
from injuries to the players. With
the exception of Fleming's accident
in the Menlo Club game no other
Stanford players have been hurt.
Those sent to play against the
Beaver team were: Bruce Fleming,
Pete Lewis, Chuck Gorham, Pod
Boothe, and Ral Clausen, substitute.
