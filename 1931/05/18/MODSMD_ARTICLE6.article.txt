# CHARITY DRIVE TOTALS $ 1824
## Living Groups Contribute $729, Clubs $201 
### 
Reaching a final t&al of $1,824.98,
the results of the 1931 Stanford Con
valescent Home annual appeal were
i submitted yesterday by A1 Denney,
treasurer of the A.S.S.U. committee
which handled the campaign.
This figure, Denney stated, in
cludes the contributions from the
living groups, the proceeds from the
| sale of tags and concessions, mail
1 orders, subscriptions, and the. re
j turns from the milk bottles. The
recently concluded drive was an ap
peal to the student body only; a
faculty campaign will be held under
i separate management in the near
i future.
Although falling far short of the
| quota set for this year, the response
to the appeal was not too disap-
I pointing, said Bob Baumgarten, gen-
J eral chairman, since the Women's
I Gymnasium drive and the general
! depression have made it difficult for
support to be as generous this year
!as in the past. He added the hope
i that next year's total would far sur
i pass all previous records.
The following amounts were de
rived from the nine major sources
; as follows:
Fraternities $656.53
Sororities 344.25
, Halls 282.42
Eating Clubs 201.39
Roble Hall 167.66
