# FAMOUS GERMAN ACTOR WILL READ 'FAUST' THURSDAY
## Max Montor Will Present Special Program In Little Theatre 
### 
Max Montor, famed German actor,
who has given dramatic readings at
most of the important universities
of the country with marked success,
will read the first part of Goethes
"Faust" in German Thursday after
noon at 3:30 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
Montor is said to be "a walking
library of dramatic literature." He
has a repertoire of well-known mas
terpieces, including "Hamlet," "Rich
ard II," "Julius Caesar," "Faust,"
"Iphigenie," "Tasso," "Don Carlos,"
"Nathan," "Gyges," and "Oedipus,"
each of which he recites from mem
ory.
Professor William Cooper, head
of the Department of Germanic
Languages, says that Montor has an
astounding facility of vocal and fa
cial expression, which enables him
to shift from one character to an
other and recite the various parts
in such a way as to create the im
pression of a stage performance.

In his reading of "Faust" he omits
the passages not essential to the ac
tion, so as to finish the drama in
about an hour and a half. Montor
is giving the reading under the aus
pices of the German Department, as
an offering on his part in anticipa
tion of the celebration next year of
the hundredth anniversary of
Goethe's death. The public is invited.
The actor is now appearing in San
Francisco in Elmer Rice's "Street
Scene," which won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1929.
