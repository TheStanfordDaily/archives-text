# NO SENIOR RECORDS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN YEARBOOK PAGES
## 
### 
One of the outstanding innova- I
tions of the new 1931 Quad will be I
the omission of all senior records in j
the section devoted to the senior j
class, in accordance with a general ,
feeling expressed by a majority of
the .graduating students.

A partial survey of the class re- j
vealed that only approximately one
sixth of the entire number would be i
willing to send in a record, and it i
has become increasingly difficult •
each year to obtain a fair estima- :
tion of the activities of each individ- '
ual. In order to avoid the false im- |
pression that would be created by i
such an incomplete rating, the edi- j
tors decided to eliminate all such j
records.
Other distinctive features of the
Quad are the enlargement and ad- '
ditional clarity of the photographs, 1
the addition of two sections of alum- :
ni and faculty, and an increase in I
the size of the athletic and activities !
sections. Information such as sum- j
maries and various statistics in the j
athletics section has been simplified J
by being presented in tabloid form. I
