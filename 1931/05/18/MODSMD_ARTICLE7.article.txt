# PUBLIC HEALTH IN DANGER FROM DOG RABIES EPIDEMICS
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 17. (/P)â€”Dr.
Giles S. Porter, State Director of
Public Health, declared "the greatly
increased prevalence of rnbies in
dogs has become a matter of serious

concern to public health authorities
throughout the state." He said fig
ures showed the increase had oc
curred largely in Southern Califor
nia, particularly in Los Angeles.
Dr. Porter said control of rabies
depended upon placing of restric
tions on dogs and cats, the most
common carriers of the disease. He
favored an ordinance in Los An
geles requiring dogs to be kept on
the premises of their owners, or on
leash. At present, he pointed out, all
licensed dogs are permitted to roam
the streets of Los Angeles unmo
lested.
