# MEXICANS DETAIN STANFORD MEN ON TECHNICAL CHARGE
## Failure To Register Auto Delays Botanists In Baja California 
### 
Word has been received that Dr. j
Ira Wiggins and Professor MacMur- j
phy, both of the Department of Bot- j
any, who have been collecting speci- |
mens in Lower California, have been
detained by the Mexican govern- I
ment until certain irregularities
concerning the entrance of their car
into Mexican territory have been
straightened out.
Wiggins, assisted by Mac Murphy, ;
is making a survey of the flora of
the peninsula of Baja California.
This is Wiggins' third expedition
into this region.
The two scientists have driven the
entire length of the peninsula, often
over rough country where automo
biles are rare. They are now at San I
Jose del Cabo, the capital of the ;
southern district of the peninsula. |
The difficulty arose over the Mex- '
ican law that automobiles must have
a certificate' to enter the southern
district, although one is not neces- 1
sary for the northern one. The bot
anists misunderstood this require
ment, but the matter is expected to (
be adjusted in a few days with the'
help of the American consul.
