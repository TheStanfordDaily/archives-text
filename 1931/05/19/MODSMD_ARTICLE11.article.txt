## Federal Tribunal Quashes State Anarchist Act 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 18 (/P).—
! California's red flag iaw was held in
! valid by the United States Supreme
I Court today. The decision was ren
i dered in the appeal of Yetta Strom
j berg, American-born daughter of
1 Russian immigrants, who was con
! victed in San Bernardino, after a
; raid on a mountain camp of com
! munists near Yucaipa. She was in
{ charge of a class of about forty "pio
, neers," children from 10 to 15 years
j old, whom she taught to salute and
| pledge allegiance to the red flag
, when it was raised each morning
i and to recite soviet lessons on "free
dom for the working class."
Chief Justice Hughes delivered
i the opinion, which held that in Miss
Stromberg's case the section of the
California law prohibiting the dis
| play of the red flag was defective
' because it undertook to punish all
' opponents of organized government
j without making specific exceptions
j to legal forms of such opposition.
| The California law reads:
"Any person who displays a red
I flag as a sign, symbol or emblem of
I opposition to organized government,
jor as an invitation or stimulus to
anarchistic action, or as an aid to
; propaganda that is of a seditious
I character, is guilty of a felony."
The jury's verdict did not specify
which prohibition Miss Stromberg
had violated. The verdict is set
! aside by the decision today.
