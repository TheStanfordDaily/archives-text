# Locale Shifts Once More For Annual Senior Ball
## 
### 
i Shunted about from one place to
i another in search of fitting "atmos
phere," the Senior Ball, purpoted
| climax to the four fleeting years of
i the undergraduate career, will find
i its setting this spring in the tall-win
, dowed dance studio and flower
I filled Spanish court of the new
! Women's Gym.
This year's choice of locale marks
i another chapter in the shifting his
tory of the University's most giam
j orous dance tradition.
In Encina's heydey, the ball was
held in its lobby, lined for the oc
casion with gala booths at which
fraternity brethren gathered with
their enamorata for punch and a
farewell talk-fest.
The class of 1910, shrewdedly
scenting the possibilities of a party
ofT-campus," chattered a flotilla of
| carriages and sporty buggies, and
went to San Jose. The success of

i this move, far exceeding the hopes
of the most ambitious, kept the Ho
| tel Vendome honored for the next
i few years with an annual coating of
red paint.
But function lapsed back to the
i Women's Clubhouse, then newly
i built, at the beginning of the Wil
bur regime. A year after his instal
lation, President Wilbur offered the
Presidential Mansion on the hill to
: the now foot-weary dance commit-
S tee. He was not to get rid of them
j until Toyon Hall was completed.
The Toyon lobby, offering a chal
lenge of dodge-and-seek about its
: colonnades and the intriguing run
way of its gravel paths, has been
j the scene of the affair for eight
! years.
j Now, as yet unchained by custom,
; the vagabond dance-moguls have
; seized upon the gym as a fresh
stamoinc eround.'
