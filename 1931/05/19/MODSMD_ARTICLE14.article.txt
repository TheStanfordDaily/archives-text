blank forms will be furnished the
organization by the Dean of Wom

|of at least three women, two of
I whom shall be connected with the
! University.
Failure to comply with any of the
i regulations may mean the cancella
i tion of the date in question, or of
j any future dates, subject to the de
-1 cision of the Eexecutive Committee.
Please remember that your pa
\ tronesses are your guests, without
| whose presence you could not have
' your dance. Therefore return their
j courtesy in doing you a favor by:
1. Seeing that they have a means
of conveyance if they wish it.

committee calls for them when the
patronesses come without their hus
bands or when they are not mar
; ried.
3. Seeing that they are given a
courteous welcome at the dance and
attention throughout the evening.
