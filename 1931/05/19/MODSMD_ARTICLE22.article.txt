V T is one thing to he mistaken
for a long-lost relative by a
millionaire. It is an entirely
different thing to b<i mistaken
for the principal of a girls'
school by a score of zealous
schoolma'ams.
At least such is the unre
served opinion of Robert All
mand, '32, who went to the
post office one recent morning
to find 22 applications for a posi
tion as teacher of classical lan
guages in the "Allmand Girls'
Preparatory School, Stanford
University" addressed to him
as superintendent.
The blushing applicants had
learned of the opening through
the Alberts Teaching Agency in
Chicago and had sent photo
graphs and full credentials.
They. wrote from all parts of
the country and were of all
types, Allmand says, skinny and
fat. old and young.
Asked if he had heard of the
school, J. P. Mitchell, Registrar,
queried: "Were the applicants
pretty?"
