# GERMAN TRAVEL IS FILM TOPIC
## Strothman To Lecture On Program Tonight 
### 
"Beautiful Germany" is the title
of the film which the German Honor
Society and the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises will present in the Lit
tle Theatre this evening at 7:30
o'clock. It will be shown instead of
the previously announced picture
"Along the Rhine on the Rhinegold
Express." Although the title is the
same as that of a former presenta- ,
tion on the campus, the reels are not
the same. They were produced this
year.
"We are very fortunate to get this i
picture," said Karl Falk, president
of the German Honor Society. "It
is in great demand all over the coun
try, and is considered the best travel
picture of Germany that has ever j
been produced." The films were
made under the direction of the
German Tourist Bureau, and are be
ing shown at Stanford under the au
spices of the Hamburg-American
Line.
Dr. Friedrich W. Strothmann, in
structor in German, will lecture,
probably in the German language,
amplifying the titles on the films. 1
The titles are in English. Dr. Stroth
mann is from the University of Co
logne in Germany, and has been in 1
the United States for a year.
