# TODAY'S ELECTION
## 
### 
I'odav revolt's w ill IkÂ» held for several student body and
class olliees, necessitated because last week no candidate
received a majority vote for any of these positions. There
lias been a tendency in the past for a much smaller per
centage of the eligible voters to participate in revote elec
tions than in the first hallotings. In the election last Tues
day, ballots were cast by a good share of the student body;
voting was heavier than il had been in many general cam
pus elections.
The olliees to be voted on today are just as important
now as they were last week. It is as vital today that an in
telligent expression of the student will be formulated in
the election as il was seven days ago. One member of the
Kxecutive Committee and a member of Men's Council will
be selected in the balloting today. The secretary of the
A.S.S.I'., who as c.r-officio secretary of the Kxecutive Com
mittee lias a vole on that committee, will be picked today.
Ami a vacancy on the Hoard of Athletic Control is to be
tilled in today's election. These are important offices, and
just as much attention should be paid them today as was
paid the larger list last week.
An amendment to the A.S.S.t'. constitution will appear
on today's ballot, as it appeared last week. The reason for
this is that the option presented to voters last week vas
ijcs or yes. After the election, il was thought that possibly
there were some who might have wished to indicate dis
approval of the amendment. So the election committee
very gravely will present the amendment a second time
today. Last week, except for the few words to be changed
in the constitution, there was no explanation of the purpose
of the amendment. Without the context, the printed words
were almost meaningless. Today the election committee
will have an opportunity to indicate exactly what the
amendment is for.
