# A 						MATTER OF TASTE
## 
### 
Striking sharply at every college "razz" section or sheet
ever published, a I'uiversity of Missouri senior is seeking
an injunction to prevent the distribution of the 19.31 Savi-
Idi', I'. of M. yearbook, because he claims, the "razz" section
contains matter that is libelous and defamatory and calcu
lated to I)riiitÂ»" liiin into disrepute.'
A great many will consider the student's move an ex
ceedingly 'unsportsmanlike one, but il is hard to deny that
"razz" sheets often do exceed the bounds of good taste;
there are numerous examples of that on the Pacific (.oast.
For the most part, they are harmless, because tlie readers
take the jibes contained in them in a spirit of fun, no matter
how offensive those jibes may be. Rut that they expose the
hapless object of their broadsides to ridicule is also unde
niable. If thev failed in that, they would not be very good
"razz" sheets.
If this Missouri senior can prove malice on the part of
the editor in his intention to publish the alleged defama
tory matter, the future of all "razz" sections is seriously
threatened. Rut no matter what the outcome of this trial
case may be, it is fairly obvious that no "razz" sheet in
which the subject matter is in poor taste should be pub
lished; il is fairly obvious also that, to be successful, few of
them can conform to that rule. Draw your own conclu
sions.
