FRATERNITY AND THE ADMIN
ISTRATION OF EDUCATION
(The IHini Weekly)
There has been a good deal of
talk and ranting lately concerning
(he fact that fraternities have been
made the "goat" by universities, who
are depicted by these pro-fraternity
bombasters as holding one hand out
lo receive and a foot uplifted to
kick, all in the same scene.
It has been contended that the
University has eased nearly the
whole matter of stimulating scholar
ship into the lap of the fraternities.
By holding threats of probation over
their head, and by appealing con
stantly to a fear of national office
discipline, the administration has
given to the fraternities that which
is really the administration's real job
—the providing of an atmosphere of
learning, and the inspiring of greater
intellectual pursuits.
On this phase of the argument we
are clearly in accord with the view
of those who believe the fraternities
are being unfairly treated. The Uni
versity has no right to impose grade
requirements for initiation, to place
houses on probation for failure to
maintain a group average, or to ex
pect the fraternity house to bo a
veritable library, and little else.
We are not so much in accord,
however, with the theory upon
which the pro-fraternity group bases
its argument. To say that fraterni
ties are '"solely social organizations
and exist only because of that rea
son" is not quite in keeping with
their character and the circum
stances under which they were
born, and in which they now live.
Perhaps in any other environment
they could be "solely social organi
zations" without being a distributing
influence to that particular environ
ment.
Fraternities are not great enough
to throw themselves across the patch
of higher education and c tili survive.
It is true that college administrators
are becoming increasingly indiffer
ent to the fraternity as a potential
asset, or increasingly impatient with
its general futility.
Let us quote what a fraternity
journal has to say about the hand
writing on the wall:
"We predict, gentlemen, the meta
morphosis of the American college
fraternity. We predict the gradual
adaptation of the institutions of
American higher learning to the Eu
ropean ideal. Wo predict the de
struction of the present system of
inter-collegiate athletics, the con
tration of undergraduate interest
upon matters intellectual and aes
thetic, the adoption of the tutorial
type of instruction combined with
the European lecture method—We
predict the depreciation of the col
lege degree and a growing empha
sis on real achievement.
"What interests us especially is the
future of the American fraternity.
We believe sincerely that no group
of men, anywhere, is more loyal
than we to all that stands behind
the Greek symbols. But let us face
the matter frankly. What earthly
excuse is there for one of the most
influential spheres of a college to be
dominated completely by immature
undergraduates, generally with anti
intellectual interests? In their cen
tury of existence have the admin
istrations of national fraternities
consciously executed any plan of
significant value to college educa
tion?
"Then why does the fraternity
live on and flourish? Because it
arouses an emotional response that
does not die and that forever affects
the thought process of the graduate.
Because the colleges today, except
Harvard and Yale, are too poor to
replace the present organization. But
we predict that as endowments and
appropriations increase, the higher
institutions will achieve wealth
which, unless the college fraternity
awakes to realization of its educa
tional responsibilities, will be used
to change almost beyond recogni
tion the Greek letter system."
The inference is plain. The fra
ternity world cannot long remain a
bad boy thumbing his nose at the
swift-moving tide of progress with
out being dashed out of existence
when the wave reaches its peak. The
quicker they lose their reputations
as homes for professional athletes
with amateur status, or for the num
ber of "rounders" that make their
bed in their dormitories, and the
similar traditions which they have
emphasized for many years, the
more likely it is that they will be
tolerated to the extent of becoming
a co-operative part of education,
rather than a stumbling block in its
path.

FRATERNITY AND THE ADMIN
ISTRATION OF EDUCATION
(The IHini Weekly)
There has been a good deal of
talk and ranting lately concerning
(he fact that fraternities have been
made the "goat" by universities, who
are depicted by these pro-fraternity
bombasters as holding one hand out
lo receive and a foot uplifted to
kick, all in the same scene.
It has been contended that the
University has eased nearly the
whole matter of stimulating scholar
ship into the lap of the fraternities.
By holding threats of probation over
their head, and by appealing con
stantly to a fear of national office
discipline, the administration has
given to the fraternities that which
is really the administration's real job
—the providing of an atmosphere of
learning, and the inspiring of greater
intellectual pursuits.
On this phase of the argument we
are clearly in accord with the view
of those who believe the fraternities
are being unfairly treated. The Uni
versity has no right to impose grade
requirements for initiation, to place
houses on probation for failure to
maintain a group average, or to ex
pect the fraternity house to bo a
veritable library, and little else.
We are not so much in accord,
however, with the theory upon
which the pro-fraternity group bases
its argument. To say that fraterni
ties are '"solely social organizations
and exist only because of that rea
son" is not quite in keeping with
their character and the circum
stances under which they were
born, and in which they now live.
Perhaps in any other environment
they could be "solely social organi
zations" without being a distributing
influence to that particular environ
ment.
Fraternities are not great enough
to throw themselves across the patch
of higher education and c tili survive.
It is true that college administrators
are becoming increasingly indiffer
ent to the fraternity as a potential
asset, or increasingly impatient with
its general futility.
Let us quote what a fraternity
journal has to say about the hand
writing on the wall:
"We predict, gentlemen, the meta
morphosis of the American college
fraternity. We predict the gradual
adaptation of the institutions of
American higher learning to the Eu
ropean ideal. Wo predict the de
struction of the present system of
inter-collegiate athletics, the con
tration of undergraduate interest
upon matters intellectual and aes
thetic, the adoption of the tutorial
type of instruction combined with
the European lecture method—We
predict the depreciation of the col
lege degree and a growing empha
sis on real achievement.
"What interests us especially is the
future of the American fraternity.
