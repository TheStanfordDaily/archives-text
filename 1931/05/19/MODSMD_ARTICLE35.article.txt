I Dr. Jordan Says:
It has always seemed to me that
j if a university president is to exert
a stimulating influence on students,
he should never relinquish the op
! portunities of the classroom. To
judge the work of scholars accurate
| ly he himself should be a scholar,
j which condition he can maintain
' only through some form of actual
research. Without personal effort to
ward the extension of knowledge,
! he is likely to fall out of harmony
with scholarship and thus fail in his
1 most important duty—the selection
of progressive men.
