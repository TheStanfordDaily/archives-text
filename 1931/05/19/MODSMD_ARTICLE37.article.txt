# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHY ABOLISH GRADES? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It has been repeatedly suggested
in various campus opinions which
The Daily has printed concerning the
Honor Code that a plus and minus
system of grading be substituted for
the existing method.
The authors of these suggestions
are probably unaware that the plus
and minus system was used here
during the early years of Stanford's
existence and that it was abandoned
after a time for the sake of future
students.
University authorities found that
so long as the alumni group re
mained small and the personnel of
the original faculty unchanged the
system worked well.
A student applying for a job after
graduation would mention Stanford.
The prospective employer would
write here and be able to get a
satisfactory reference because pro
fessors would have a personal ac
quaintance with the applicant.
But as the alumni group got larger
and the personnel of the faculty
changed, inquiries began to come in
about alumni, whom nobody re
membered. A look at the records
would show only a string of unillu
minating pluses with perhaps a
minus or two. The University would
be unable to give a satisfactory ref
erence.
It was to avoid this situation that
the A-B-C-D method of grading
was adopted. â€”Michael Crofoot.
