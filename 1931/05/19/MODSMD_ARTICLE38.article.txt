The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Northcote, in Campus Opinion,
put forward a point of view which
must be shared by the majority of
the members of this University—
that it is iniquitous that one who
has been convicted of an infraction
of the Honor Code should be per
mitted to run for office on the Men's
Council.
The Daily, in an editorial, endeav
ored to warn the student electorate
against putting into office "a certain
student" who cannot be considered
to have the interests of the Code
at heart.
Both of these statements are ad
mirable as far as they go, and Mr.
Northcote goes as far as his capacity
as a private individual permits. It
appears to me, however, that a Daily
editorial on this subject will remain
merely a confession of weakness and
the enforcement of the Honor Code
ineffective, until the Men's Council
and The Daily gain the courage of
their convictions and drop the term
"a certain student"; and make public
the names of those who are found
guilty of offences against the honor
of the whole student body.
