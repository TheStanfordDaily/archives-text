Now that that gorgeous monstros
ity, the Women's Edition of the
Daily, is out of the way, we can
settle down to sensible work. Doubt
if the olTice will ever be the same
again, after that day of substitutions
—lipstick for lingo, and querulous
ness for masculine profanity. But
they must have their fun.
No one seems to have noticed
it, but Stanford was entered in a
little track meet last Saturday.
Interesting, isn't it, the things
we miss if we don't read the
newspapers?
In all events, we hope the Dekcs
aren't as bankrupt as the rest of us
are at this end of the year. Maybe
if they feed Hec and Podge enough
to keep them from blowing away,
they'll be able to make the grade
back to the 1.C.4-A. We really
should have a handful of blond won
ders, back there. Can you hear the
murmur that runs over the crowd—
"My! Steenford men! and so intelli
gent, too . . .
Likewise sportingly. it appears
that our old pal Helen Wills
Moody is to play some tennis
here tomorrow. Why is it that
the hardest-hitting athletes ac
quire haloes and walk 011 noth
ing milder than gardenia petals,
while the woman who makes the

hardest biscuits or pie crust is
crowned only by her husband?
Another touching inquiry came
yesterday to be answered in the
lovelorn section. Questions from
women are hard to answer, because
! the letters must always first be
' classified. We ask ourselves two in
j terdependent questions: Has the
1 writer IT or has she IF? IT letters
! are fun to answer; the others must
i be handled very carefully.
If you are essentially an IT girt,
: you'll get along anyway, and can af
( ford to have a little IF, even—sort of
i questioning, to lead the public along,
j But if you have only IF, may Lord
1 and the Editor help you! Cabbages
j refuses to deal with vital statistics.
Dear Hester Cabbage: About
three weeks ago, I met a very
handsome senior, and was very
much impressed by his appear
ance and actions. He hasn't made
any attempt to see or talk to me
since. I walk by his fraternity
house every day, have called
him on the phone every night
for three weeks, and have writ
ten him four letters. Do you
suppose he is just waiting for an
opportunity to see me again, or
what? I'lcasc advise me what to
do. He is wonderful, and I want
to know him. —B.E.Z.
