## READING SLIPS—APPROACHING A FARCE 
### 
Cheating in examinations is the 1
sensational feature of Honor Code
violations. It is this type of viola- ]
tion that many students oppose 1
quite vociferously—probably because i
there is a chance at detection. There
are, however, other phases of the
Honor Code, and one of them that [
receives very little attention is the j
reading slip. If cheating in exam- (
inations is likened to cheating at i
poker; then dishonesty with these j
slips is akin to dishonesty in soli- '
taire.
To those who have not had ex- 1
perience with these slips, a rare I
treat is in store. Their purpose is to j
indicate the outside reading that the
student is doing for a particular
course. The student merely indi- j
cates the references and the number i
of pages that he has consumed in j
each. These slips are then handed in, j
and the professor then is supposed i
to have an idea of the reading done, !
and a possible basis for scoring if
he desires.
Now this seems an excellent thing j
—the student can read where his i
fancy dictates and can read ' for j
pleasure without the annoying bother i
of taking notes. The theory is ex- j
eel lent.
The practice is deplorable, for the
only limit to some students reading
reports is the volume of ink con
tained in their fountain pens and the
degree of hardness of the'ir con
science; and oh! how hard some stu
dents get after about 20 units of work
requiring such practice. The size of
the reading slips usually progresses
geometrically as the weeks go by.
In one class, the highest slip seen |

I the first week was 150 pages—it had
jumped to 250 the next week--the
third week saw one over 400 —but
! htye your reporter weakened and did
not have the courage to look i'ur
! ther. From that week on, he places
i his meager slip in with the rest with
; eyes closed so as not to receive any
i qualms from failing to keep up with
j the high-speed, accelerating readers.
If one is hopeful, one can attribute
! this progressive increase of size to
j increased interest in the subject. If
one is more skeptical, the answer
would be due to some students
wishing to keep ahead of the class
i at any cost—even that expense of
' purchasing larger reading slips and
bigger fountain pens. It is a good
thing that courses do not last tiO
; weeks or reading slips would prob
i ably resemble outstanding sums of
i German paper marks.
The reading slips are also not ade
i quate tests of reading done due to
i the varied thoroughness of work.
Some students seem to feel that
' their duty has been fulfilled if the
| paragraph heads have been noted;
i while others feel the first and last
I sentences must be read before the
I page can be counted.
j The Honor Code fails in this re
| gard because even less enforcement
is possible than in examinations. A
better policy would be either to re
quire no slips and merely suggest
readings; or, if slips must be had,
hours of work rather than pages
should be the criterion. This would
take less ink and space than the
placing of pages and would not be
a great incentive for rapid and shal
low reading to build up the number
| of pages. —Abe MellinkofT
