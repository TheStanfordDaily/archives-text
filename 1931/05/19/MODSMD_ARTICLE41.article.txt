THEATRE STREET — By Tamara
Karsavina. E. P. Dutton & Com
pany. 1931. $3.75. (At the Palo
Alto Book Store.)
| Theatre Street is genuinely enter
taining. This is more than can be
said of much of this new type of
! literature flooding the market known
as the personal reminiscence. Tamara
Karsavina is fascinating, herself, and
j as she stands out clearly throughout
I the book, from page to page—the
i book is fascinating, too.
Madame Karsavina of the famous
i Imperial School of the Ballet in old
j S). Petersburg, writes intimately of
! the Marinsky, Theatre Street, and
' European celebrities. As one of the
most-loved of the Russian dancers,
! a personal friend of the late Pavlova,
! feted by royalty wherever she jour
| neyed, Karsavina has a background
of intriguing fact. She uses beautiful
j English, not a painstaking transla-
I tion, this, which has lost much in
; the change—but a true Russian
I writing in real English—a faultless
| combination.
There is no dragging of plot in
this story of the life of a charming
woman; contrarily, there is a clipped
twang to the words that lasts from
' the first brief bits of memories from
childhood, to the last description of
the heart-break of the Revolution
| and new beginnings. —V.B.T.
PAUL GAUGUIN—By Beril Beckcr.
I New York. Albert & Charles Boni.
! 1931. $3.50. (At the Stanford Book
' store.)
"The Culm Madman," the sub
| title, is the epithet that has been ap
! plied to this respectable banker who
I suddenly left his business and his
! family and dressed like "a hero in
I a comic opera" devoted his life to
I painting. Even his painting, which
was exceedingly radical for the last
j century, was ridiculed.
Practically no recognition was
given Gauguin before his death. His
life was a perpetual struggle and he
1 died in misery with a jail sentence
I awaiting him among the Marquc-
I sans.

Gauguin, seeing the sordidness of
European life, sought a simple, na
tural existence devoid of the com
plexity that he didn't wish to un
derstand. Civilization is cruel to
| apostates and the artist had to sui
! fer everlasting derision and the mis
understanding of his wife, whom he
adored. For short intervals he found
happiness with the Marquesans. He
lived among these simple South Sea
| tribes because he liked their way of
' life and their appreciation of natural
1 beauty. The natives could not un
[ derstand Gauguin but he understood
' them. Perhaps the most encouraging
remark he ever received from either
' savage or European was that of an
i other artist: "It is extraordinary that
one can express so much mystery
with so much light."
Beril Beker's treatment of the
j eternal question of whether artists
I are entirely mad leaves us, at least,
I with a negative verdict. This is an
enlightening book to read whether
one has ever heard of Gauguin or
| not. —E.P.

Beril Beker's treatment of the

Karsavina. E. P. Dutton & Com
pany. 1931. $3.75. (At the Palo
Alto Book Store.)
| Theatre Street is genuinely enter
taining. This is more than can be
said of much of this new type of
! literature flooding the market known
as the personal reminiscence. Tamara
Karsavina is fascinating, herself, and
j as she stands out clearly throughout
I the book, from page to page—the
i book is fascinating, too.
Madame Karsavina of the famous
i Imperial School of the Ballet in old
j S). Petersburg, writes intimately of
! the Marinsky, Theatre Street, and
' European celebrities. As one of the
most-loved of the Russian dancers,
! a personal friend of the late Pavlova,
! feted by royalty wherever she jour
| neyed, Karsavina has a background
of intriguing fact. She uses beautiful
j English, not a painstaking transla-
I tion, this, which has lost much in
; the change—but a true Russian
I writing in real English—a faultless
| combination.
There is no dragging of plot in
this story of the life of a charming
woman; contrarily, there is a clipped
twang to the words that lasts from
' the first brief bits of memories from
childhood, to the last description of
the heart-break of the Revolution
| and new beginnings. —V.B.T.

"The Culm Madman," the sub
| title, is the epithet that has been ap
! plied to this respectable banker who
I suddenly left his business and his
! family and dressed like "a hero in
I a comic opera" devoted his life to
I painting. Even his painting, which
was exceedingly radical for the last
j century, was ridiculed.
Practically no recognition was
given Gauguin before his death. His
life was a perpetual struggle and he
1 died in misery with a jail sentence
I awaiting him among the Marquc-
I sans.

Gauguin, seeing the sordidness of
European life, sought a simple, na
tural existence devoid of the com
plexity that he didn't wish to un
derstand. Civilization is cruel to
| apostates and the artist had to sui
! fer everlasting derision and the mis
understanding of his wife, whom he
adored. For short intervals he found
happiness with the Marquesans. He
lived among these simple South Sea
| tribes because he liked their way of
' life and their appreciation of natural
1 beauty. The natives could not un
[ derstand Gauguin but he understood
' them. Perhaps the most encouraging
remark he ever received from either
' savage or European was that of an
i other artist: "It is extraordinary that
one can express so much mystery
with so much light."
