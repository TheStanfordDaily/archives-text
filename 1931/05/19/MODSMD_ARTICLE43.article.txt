Way back in the year '00, big
chested Farm lads used to work out
on the track and field through the
winter and early spring months with
but one object in mind: flogging the
Golden Bear. Today, with the erst
while "Big Meet" relegated to the
realms of mythology, the annual
fracas with Troy's Terrible Trojans
has taken the sportlight as THE dual
meet of the country.
Yet a victory over S.C. is not
the final goal of Stanford's sea
son, despite the sentiment which
has made it. for this college
generation, the track classic
most popular in the eyes of the
rabid.
"We want to go out there and
win Saturday, hut you guys bet
ter get out of your heads the
idea that this meet is so damned
important. Do your best, and
then, win or lose, we'll go on
working toward our final objec
tive of the season, the 1.C.4-A.
at Philadelphia.
That's what Dink Templeton had
1o say about it at a meeting of his
team a couple of days before May 2
last and the Troy dual affair which
is now, of course, but a bad dream.
From subsequent developments, in
cluding a couple of overwhelm'.ng
defeats at the hands of Cromwell's
boys, it appears that Robert L. meant
exactly what he said.
Captain Podge Smith has had
a tricky leg muscle for the past
three weeks. It simply cramps
up on him once in a while after
a hard workout. Podge probably
could have run a fast flight of
highs in both the Fresno relays
and the California Intercollegi
atvs, with no noticeable ill ef
fects. Yet Templeton kept him
out, sacrificing plenty of "cinch"
points just to be sure that the
Cardinal captain can put in his
best bid for a potential few two
weeks hence.
And we wonder whether Arnie
West, crippled for so long in early
season, has really let himself out
since his return to the broadjumping
[ its. Again last Saturday, the fact
that Dink is overlooking nothing was
evidenced when Hec Dyer stayed
out of the furlong after lie showed
a slight limp at the finish of the
hundred. Dyer probably could have
run, perhaps even won. Wykoff s
time would not have been so fast,
say we, if llcc had boon in the race.
Templeton has always been a
disciple of the "you-can't-work
'em-too-hard" school of track
thought. Nevertheless, he kept
Eastman out of the half-mile
Saturday, and Les Ilablcs out
of the 440. though he could have
run them both and still won the
relay. Vic Williams, by the way,
was too "all in" to attempt that
last lap for Troy. Trying to
overtake Ben in that greatest of
all quarter-mile races evidently
put him out for the day, while
Eastman recuperated quickly to
come hack and beat 48 flat in
that last lap of the final event.
Two weeks remain for the red
shirted cripples to get into shape.
Smith, Dyer, and West, a trio pack
ing plenty of potential points, must
be at their best if Stanford would
win the collegiate crown. At any
rate, Dink will "shoot the works" in
the East, angling for every possible
point, regardless of anything. It will
be the final stand of his 1931 outfit,
given its last chance to come through
as a "world-beater," which at pres
ent simply means "Troy-beater."

Vic Williams, until recently
considered by some as the na
tion's best quarter-miler, seems
to have the interest of Stanford
at heart. Three weeks ago he
put out his hand to keep from
tearing Ilablcs' leg muscle to
shreds with his spikes. Last Sat
urday after Eastman had
equalled the world 440 mark to
beat him, Williams took Ben
aside and told him, confiden
tially, that he figured he (Ben)
would have a better chance in
the half than in the quarter back
East. Thanks, Vic, old man.
