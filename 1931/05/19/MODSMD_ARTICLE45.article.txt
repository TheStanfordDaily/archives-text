# Injuries Dim Hope for 1931 I.C.4-A Triumph
## LIGHT WORKOUTS ARE PLANNED FOR WEEK'S PRACTICE Captain Podge Smith And Hec Dyer Both On Inactive List

Lazy weather hit the Stadium yes- i
terday afternoon, as Dink Temple- j
ton and a few of his trackmen j
turned out to see what can still be
done about the 1931 Stanford sea
son. With two of the big guns of the
Cardinal attack held out of action
by injuries, the squad is going to 1
take things rather easily for a couple
of days before starting an intensive |
training period for the last and most
important meet of the year, the I.C.
4--A. in Philadelphia, May 29 and 30.
Captain Podge Smith and Hec j
Dyer are the two Indians who oc
cupy the sqtiad wheel-chairs, which |
have, unfortunately, been pretty
much in demand all season. Smith
didn't even enter the California In
tercollegiates at Los Angeles last
Saturday because of a muscle in
jury acquired at the Fresno Relays
a week earlier. He was not out for
practice yesterday and may not be
able to work out for a few more
days.
Dyer Has Muscle Cramp
Dyer had a muscle cramp after
the century in the Coliseum, in
which he placed second to Frank
Wykoff of S.C., and did not enter
the 220. This mishap was identical !
with one which occurred in the
L.A.A.C. meet earlier in the year.
At that time the lanky Stanford
sprinter was absent from the oval
for three days, and it is not ex
pected that he will be slowed down
at Philadelphia by his present in
jury.
Frank Lombardi was running
easily yesterday for the first time in
two weeks. His arches seem to be
in better shape than at any time
since the Big Meet, and he says he
feels great. In good condition, Lom
bardi is a cinch for a point or so in
1.C.4-A. competition.
Trojans Strongest
This season's Pacific Coast meets
have quite definitely proven one
thingâ€”that the Trojans are a strong
er team on meet days than the In
dians. There are still some of us
who cling to the idea that Temple
ton's team is potentially stronger
than Dean Cromwell's, but that as
pect of the track year is now a
closed book.
The 1.C.4-A. presents more the ap
pearance of a free-for-%11 than a
team meet. Success for a univer
sity depends more upon the stars of
the squad in this national affair than
in any other meet of the season.
Stanford and Southern California
have the greatest collections, but the
third place points which defeated
the Indians in dual competition will
not help the Trojan cause much in
the 1.C.4-A.
A Battle of Stars
It will be a battle of stars then,
with Stanford pinning her hopes for
a national title on Smith, Dyer, Lom
bardi, Les Hables, Ben Eastman, j
Maynor Shove, Arnie West, A1 Nis- l
bet, Bob Jones, Here Laborde, Nel- j
lie Gray and Norm McLeod.
The Trojans will have more than i
their share of stars in Wykoff, Carls, j
Payne, Delby, Barber, Paul, Wil- j
liams, Woessner, Stewart, Grabner,
MacNaughton, and Hall.
In a constellation of that bril- !
liance a single falling star will spell j
the difference between victory and I

I
! defeat, grins and groans. Dink has i
j an even break in this final chance of 1
; the season, and with a slight let-up )
t in the injury hoax which has hound- |
| cd the Farm boys all year, he can
j bring the 1.C.4-A. trophy to Stan- i
I ford again.
