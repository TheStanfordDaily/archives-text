i It was just ten years ago this sea
json that Robert L. (Dink) Temple
i ton took over the job of coaching
' Stanford track teams.
1 During this decade the Indians
1 have four times won the 1.C.4-A.
I championship, eight times scalped
; the Trojans, and seven times beaten
California. Today Dink stands at the
; top of his profession. That he is one
'of the greatest coaches in the
| United States and a candidate for
head mentor of the 1932 Olympic
; team is generally acknowledged.
It is particularly interesting to
I look back on the array of great track
j and field -stars, outstanding not only
! on the Pacific Coast but in the whole
country that Dink has piloted to
glory and Avho have in a sense
brought fame to the erstwhile "Boy
i Coach."
I There are Pacific Coast and
| 1.C.4-A. champions in almost every
! event and world's champions in a
I few among the array. Only in the
j mile and two-mile runs has Tempie
ton failed to produce a succession of

| athletes, famous in California, and
! at least one man outstanding in na
; tional competition.
! Because the distance race honor
| roll is shortest and least distin
! guished, it seems best to begin with
i it.
Foremost among all Templeton's
| milers is Alex McKinnon. His best
j clocking was only 4:23.8, but he beat
1 his men when the meet depended
1 on it. In winning both the mile and
I the half-mile in the 1929 U.S.C.
! meet, he carved for himself a niche
| in the Stanford hall of fame as a
i great "come through" performer. He
j is the only Card miler to ever place
j in the 1.C.4-A., taking fifth in '28.
i Henry Coe. holder of the Stanford
j two-mile record of 9:38.4, is the
- premier eight-lap man of all Dink's
I teams. Tremendously hard work
I made him what he was as he was
only a mediocre miler when he en
i tered school. Cocky Paul Aebersold
|of this year's squad may prove a
worthy successor to Coe.
! So much for Dink's distance men.
