# VARSITY GOLFERS BACK TODAY FROM NORTHERN DEFEAT
## Loss Of Coast Title Ruins Hopes For Perfect Season Record 
### 
The varsity golf team arrived
back hi Palo Alto this morning from
Eugene, Oregon, where they failed
by three strokes to take the Pacific
coast intercollegiate title and climax
an undefeated season.
At the end of 36 holes of medal
play Friday, Oregon University had
a four man aggregate of 625 strokes,
while the Indians had taken 627.
MacNaughton Wins
Although their hopes for a perfect
season were wrecked, the squad did
not return without some measure of
glory, as Malcolm MacNaughton
succeeded in taking the Pacific coast
individual crown from Oregon's fin
est during the invasion.
Already southern, division title
holder, Mac came through three 18-
hole matches Saturday and Sunday
to dethrone Vince Dolph of Oregon.
Stanford's Warner Edmonds did
most of the dethroning, when he
eliminated Dolp in a semi-final
match Saturday. He was Mac's op
ponent in the finals.
Course Hard
Comparison of scores of the Cali
fornia intercollegiate tourney, in
which Stanford won the southern
section title, and the meet with Ore
gon shows one of two things. Either
the Eugene Country Club course is
a lot tougher than the Stanford
links or the Indian club swingers
were woefully off form. In captur
ing the California title, they had a
four man aggregate of 613 strokes,
as compared with the 627 it took
them in Eugene. Individual scores
in the California tourney were Mac-
Naughton, 151, Eichelberger, 154,
Hawley, 153, and Edmonds, 155.
Against Oregon they were as fol
lows: MacNaughton, 156, Eichelber
ger, 158, Hellman, 158, and Ed
monds, 155.
The fact that the Webfoots were
competing on their home course may
enter into the reckoning also.
