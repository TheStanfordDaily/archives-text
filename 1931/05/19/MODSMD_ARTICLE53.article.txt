Selecting five Stanford men on his |
j all-California Intercollegiate base- !
I ball team, Harry Wolter, coach of
the champion Indians, also included
two Trojans, a California man, and

to Ward, U.S.C., placing California's !
catcher, Smith,* as second choice.
First base was given to Arbelbide,
I U.S.C., who won out over Hardy,
' Stanford, due to his hitting ability. ,
At second base, Wolter placed
Philippi, Stanford, who was given
i the edge over Harper, Santa Clara.
There was no question in the mind
| of the Cards' coach as to who should |
get the third base assignment, giv
ing it to Dykes Johnson, Stanford.
Delmas Given Shortstop
The question of shortstop was dif
j ficult with both Delmas, Stanford,
and Mohler, U.S.C., competing for |
the job. Because of his better field- i
ing average, Delmas was given the
! call over his Trojan rival.
In the outfield, Harry Wolter |
, placed Rintala, Stanford; Kirwan, 1

California; and Gaddy, S.F.U. Se
