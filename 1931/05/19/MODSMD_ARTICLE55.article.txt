# SCIENTIST CLAIMS CREATION DUE TO ONE COSMIC-ATOM
## Unique Atom Conceived As Dividing Infinitely In World Formation 
### 
NEW YORK, May 18. (/P) —A dar
ing idea that creation began in one
single, vast atom is advanced by
Abbe G. Lematire of Louvain, Bel
gium.
Lemaiti't is the astronomer whose
cosmology, or theory of creation, re
cently has supplanted those of Ein
stein and De Sitter in the favor of
many scientists.
lie explains the single atom origin
in Nature, the Journal of British
Science, under the title: "The be
ginning of the World from the Point
of View of Quantum Theory."
The Quantum Theory holds that
all energy is made up of separate
packages, called quanta. Thus a
stove radiating heat docs not give
off a continuous flow, despite the
impression of human senses to that
• effect. It has been demonstrated that
the heat flows out in jerks, made up
of separate quanta bundles. The
stove cools in a series of steps.
Lemaitre points out that these
quanta packages are constantly in
creasing in number, although the
total amount of energy in the uni
verse remains constant. This means
that the energy is being transferred
from larger bins into the tiny, sepa
rate bundles. The stars are one kind
of bin; their radiation a flow of
quanta.
"We could conceive the beginning
of the universe," he says, "in the
form of a unique atom, the atomic
weight of which is the total mass of
the universe. This highly unstable
atom would divide in smaller and
smaller atoms by a kind of super
radioactive process."
If this suggestion is correct Le
maitre says it is conceivable that
time and space did not begin until
after the original atom had divided
into a sufficient number of quanta.
