j man actor, who will read Goethe's
"Faust" in the Little Theatre Thurs
! day afternoon at 3:30 o'clock, has
! the surprising faculty of learning
entire plays, rather than separate
j parts. He retains such a varied re
i pertoire in his memory, and is said
Iby critics to have such facility of
vocal and facial expression, that he
i may easily be called a whole thca
! trical company in one person.
"Give him three words from any
i part of Goethe's "Faust" and he will
1 complete the passage," wrote George
in the Pittsburgh Sun-Tele
graph. "And he'll do the same with
I almost every German dramatist and
; with Shakespeare. I've tested him."
Montor has been famous in Ger
-1 many for a generation, playing hun
; dreds of parts in Berlin, Munich,
I Hamburg, and other cities. He was
I born in Vienna, and made his d>-but
J in Zurich as Mephistopheles. Al

Gynt and Cyrano in the leading
