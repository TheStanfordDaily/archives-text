The Stanford Arboretum was seri
ously endangered by a grass fire
which started about 9:30 o'clock yes
terday morning. It is believed that
the blaze was stalled by a cigarette
butt carelessly tossed aside.
Fanned by a high wind, the fire
spread rapidly in the dry grass un
der the trees. Three fire trucks and
about 40 men were called into ser
vice in an effort to check the flames
before they reached the higher
branches of the trees.
The lire blackened about one and
one-half acres of grass and de
stroyed several small trees before
being extinguished.
Fire Chief Dugan of the Univer
sity has issued a warning against
open fires of any kind on the cam
pus because of the danger from diy
grass. He has also requested Ihat
motorists avoid parking their cars
in the grass areas about the campus,
and be extremely careful with burn
ing tobacco.
