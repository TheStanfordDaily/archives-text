### 
Six reels of picturesque rural
panoramas, quaint medieval scenes,
; and typical urban views of Ihe Ger
' man Republic were shown to a capa
i city audience last night in the Little
Theatre. Since it was necessary to
| turn away dozens of eager specta
tors, there is a possibility that the
i pictures may be presented again be
fore the end of the quarter, said Karl
Falk, president of the German Hon
or Society, which, in conjunction
with the Committee on Public Exer
cises, was responsible for the pro
-1 gram.
Professor Friedrich W. Stroth
mann, instructor in German, who is
in a position to give first-hand 111-
foi*mation on Germany, having come
I from that country to the United
States a year ago, supplemented the
! titles on the films with many in
| forming comments. In an introduc
tion to the pictures, he said, "One
of the things which makes Germany
interesting is the difference between
the big cities and the small parts.
I The population of the rural districts
!is rather conservative, and has not
changed its customs for several cen
turies. Those of you who have seen
j only the big cities have seen practi
cally nothing at all. But not all of
the cities have developed as Berlin,
Munich, Hamburg, or Cologne.
Thei'e are some which still preserve
medieval characteristics."
The trip shown on the screen last
night included a day's voyage up the
Rhine, the dream of all tourists.
"There are so many castles along
the Rhine, that no German can re
member all their names," said Pro
fessor Strothmann. The same trip
takes three hours by fast train.

all were snapped by the camera.
