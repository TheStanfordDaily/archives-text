Refusal of Harvard In inscribe on its new war memo
rial chapel Hie names of three of its graduates who died
fighting for (icrmanv along with the names of those who
died in Ihe service of the Allies seems to have set a prece
dent. Now Cornell is refusing to inscribe anywhere in its
war memorial Ihe name of Hans Wagner, a graduate who
died for (icrmanv.

No wonder The Nation joins with The Harvard Crimson
in expressing indignant disapproval of such narrow
minded nationalism: "Three German lads who had the
bad judgment lo light and die for the Fatherland —though
they fell before Ihe entry of the United States into the
World War may have their names inscribed in the new
and costly Harvard memorial chapel, but on a separate
tablet to distinguish them from their more fortunate fel
lows who died for Ihe Allies.

"This puts God on the right side and at the same time
indicates that He is not without pity for an enemy . . . em
phatic answer was given by Harvard authorities that
merely at Ihe suggestion of making the chapel other than
strictly an Allied memorial much of the money already
pledged would have been withdrawn. Since the memorial
chapel is an indefensible monument to war and neither a
necessary nor a desirable adjunct to the university, this
would have been an excellent outcome.'"
