# OVERHAULING WOMEN'S REGULATIONS
## 
### 
As the trial year for the 2:.'W o'clock late leaves draws'
to a close, the women's living groups are again expressing
opinions about their regulations. Complete revision seems)
to have followed in the wake of alteration made for the j
"2:.'Ws", until now there is scarcely a rule that has not
been considered with a view to changing it.
While this complete overhauling has caused misunder
standing about some regulations, it has had many good
results. It has made some of the women think about their
community life here.
With another hour added to the list of late leaves, the
number in the women's regulations is five: 10:30, 11 :30, 12, [
1:30, and 2:30 o'clock leaves. Over-organization might |
easily be considered a fault of this system. But with the |
last suggestions made in women's conference, the 11 :30
leaves will be replaced by 12 o'clock leaves. However, it
has now been proposed that another figure be added to the |
list. It is suggested that freshmen be limited to three 2:30
o'clock midweek late leaves; they now have four 11:30!
leaves. Why not let them have four 2:3o's and simplify j
the rules still further?
Conference is headed on the right track in bringing
every late leave up for consideration. Whether or not the i
2:30 o'clock leaves are continued next year, this trial pe
riod will be successful from the standpoint of all other
rules. Conference has done some good reorganization
work now it must guard against over-organization.
