## WHY A LIBERAL COLLEGE? 
### 
The great pastime for magazine
writers is to tell what's wrong with
college. This makes an excellent title
not only because the alliteration is
catchy but because the subject-'
matter is sure to prove popular to
all-' those who have claim
against college—from the person who
objects to paying taxes for the sup
port of state universities to the dis
gruntled graduate who to his dismay
finds his diploma is not a positive
bank draft.

The reason for such continued
crying over the evils and short
comings of institutions of higher
learning is in a large degree due
to a misconception of the purpose
of a liberal college. Obviously if
people expect the wrong things from
a college education, they are sure to
be disappointed. Now, in talking
about colleges, the reference is sole
ly to undergraduate institutions spe
cializing in presenting what has been
called a liberal education. Automati
cally are excluded law, medicine,
and engineering students —and also
those students writing their theses
on detailed, vague, and useless sub
jects. We would never claim that
these students should be abolished,
for soon we will be one ourselves.
However, these students have no
place in a liberal college and prop
erly would never be placed in such
a category.

If a liberal college is not to train
people to become scholars or to
make money, what is its purpose?
To teach people to think is almost
light even though somewhat hack

neyed. To teach students to live is
more correct. This does not mean
those phases of living included in
making "contacts" or perfecting so
cial manners or the like. These
things can be learned more rapidly
and with less bother at some sum
mer resort or fashionable winter
haven.
What then is necessary to live in
this world? Anyone that knew defi
nitely would be some super creature
—making the broad assumption that
il is possible to know at all. The
person who gets the most out of his
liberal education will have acquired
a sophisticated attitude to current
affairs; and sophistication does not
mean smoking Murads at the slight
est provocation. The graduate should
be able to carry on a fairly intelli
gent conversation on subjects of
more than just general interest. He
should live by being ali\;e to what
has been and what is going on. Ho
should be able to laugh at the bunko
in politics, literature, and general
thought that is constantly being
floated around. He should develop
not only the power to think out
present problems; but it is highly
essential that he acquire habits thai
will make for continued intellectual
progress in his days after gradua
tion.

If these are the tims of the liberal
college, then it is evident that many
of the criticisms of universities are
not founded; it is equally evident
that there are many phases of higher
education that could stand some
fierce criticism.

be disappointed. Now, in talking
about colleges, the reference is sole
ly to undergraduate institutions spe
cializing in presenting what has been
called a liberal education. Automati
cally are excluded law, medicine,
and engineering students —and also
those students writing their theses
on detailed, vague, and useless sub
jects. We would never claim that
these students should be abolished,
for soon we will be one ourselves.
However, these students have no
place in a liberal college and prop
erly would never be placed in such
a category.

If a liberal college is not to train
people to become scholars or to
make money, what is its purpose?
To teach people to think is almost
light even though somewhat hack

neyed. To teach students to live is
more correct. This does not mean
those phases of living included in
making "contacts" or perfecting so
cial manners or the like. These
things can be learned more rapidly
and with less bother at some sum
mer resort or fashionable winter
haven.
What then is necessary to live in
this world? Anyone that knew defi
nitely would be some super creature
—making the broad assumption that
il is possible to know at all. The
person who gets the most out of his
liberal education will have acquired
a sophisticated attitude to current
affairs; and sophistication does not
mean smoking Murads at the slight
est provocation. The graduate should
be able to carry on a fairly intelli
gent conversation on subjects of
more than just general interest. He
should live by being ali\;e to what
has been and what is going on. Ho
should be able to laugh at the bunko
in politics, literature, and general
thought that is constantly being
floated around. He should develop
not only the power to think out
present problems; but it is highly
essential that he acquire habits thai
will make for continued intellectual
progress in his days after gradua
tion.

If these are the tims of the liberal
college, then it is evident that many
of the criticisms of universities are
not founded; it is equally evident
that there are many phases of higher
education that could stand some
fierce criticism.

The great pastime for magazine
writers is to tell what's wrong with
college. This makes an excellent title
not only because the alliteration is
catchy but because the subject-'
matter is sure to prove popular to
all-' those who have claim
against college—from the person who
objects to paying taxes for the sup
port of state universities to the dis
gruntled graduate who to his dismay
finds his diploma is not a positive
bank draft.

The reason for such continued
crying over the evils and short
comings of institutions of higher
learning is in a large degree due
to a misconception of the purpose
of a liberal college. Obviously if
people expect the wrong things from
a college education, they are sure to
be disappointed. Now, in talking
