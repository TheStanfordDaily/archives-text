STREET SCENE—At the Geary
Theatre.
There is no doubt that "Street
Scene" deserved the Pulitzer award
of 1929, nor that it is worthy of
every future tribute that may be
offered. As a cross-section of life to
day, it is perhaps the best piece of
realism yet contributed to the mod
ern trend of art.
A single scene suffices for the
three acts, the front of a New York
tenement. The action takes place
from one humid summer afternoon,
through to the following evening.
During that time the Maurrant fam
ily becomes well known to the audi
ence—the father cold and surly, the
the mother weakly looking for pleas
ure in life, the daughter lovely and
loved by Sam, the son of a Jewish
communist. Tragedy is inevitable,
for the father knows his wife's
weakness, and he kills her and her
bill-collector lover.
A cast could be found for "Street
Scene"' by picking people who ac
tually are the types represented.
They need litttle training, only di
recting. Elmer Rice himself directs
his play, and it is evident that he
knows his "Street S"cene" thorough
ly, from the gossipy, "I always say"
Mrs. Jones, to the cocky policeman,
both of whom relieve the drab sor-

I didness of the more dramatic char
acters. J.N.

POMPILLA AND HER POET—By
Harriet Gaylord. New York: Bren
tano's. 1931. 52.50.
Written not for Browning schol-
I ars, but for those who might not
otherwise know the humanness of
Robert Browning and his wife, Miss
Gaylord has interpreted their life
| together as it is reflected in "The
' Ring and the Book."
In doing so she first discusses the
j characters in Browning's great work
I from the moment of inspiration to
I the last and only glimpse Count
Guido has of the purity of Pompilia.
i She believes, and one who has read
i the tragedy of Pompilia willingly
| agrees, that Elizabeth Barrett
Browning was the one who influ
| enced her husband's artistic sym
| pathy—that without her it would
i not have been written.
The second part of the book is
j devoted to a biography of the
Brownings. Of especial value is its
; appearance now, when interest in the
poets has been renewed by "The
1 Barretts of Wimpole Street." But it
1 is undoubtedly more accurate, and
lof more intrinsic value than the
I drama, because of the sincere ex
j pression of the lyrical charm of
i "Pompilia and her poet. —J.N.
