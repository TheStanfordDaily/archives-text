MORE ON THE WORLD COURT
The Editor, Sir:

At last there has arisen some dis
cussion on the subject of the League
of Nations and the World Coust. I
have till now refrained from ex
pressing myself in print on this sub
ject; but, now that I lind that my
opinions are to some degree also
held by Mr. Mellinkoff and Mr.
Monteagle, I think it is fitting that
I should say something.

Mr. Mellinkoff is quite right in |
saying that many intelligent people I
do not oppose the League and Court j
because of Hearst's wild statements.
It seems that if there are six good !
reasons for. opposing anything, 1
Hearst gives six bad reasons for op- j
posing it. Hearst is probably right i
in doing this, for his six bad reasons
will appeal to the majority of his j
readers. Hearst, however, is not al- i
ways wrong, as many think; and he j
deserves much credit for fighting the !
League and the Court.
There are many reasons for oppos- j
ing the League. One does not have :
to consider at all the famous Article 1
X of the Covenant of the League, j
Mr. Coolidge in his autobiography
gives probably the best reason why |
the United States should not join Lhe j
League. He says that whatever way '
our members in the Assembly (or j
our member on the Council) would j
vote, it would cause discord at home. !
In short, the European jealousies j
would be transferred to the United j
States, where there are people from
all the countries of Europe. It can
not be denied that a person born in,
say, Germany, or of German parent
age, would sympathize with that |
country. Hence, if American reprc- !
sentatives at the League voted I
against Germany on some question, j
there would be a great outcry in the j
United States among such persons.
It may be remarked that the |
League of Nations is not a world !
league, but a European league, dom
inated by the big powers of Europe
and confronted primarily by prob- ;
lems in which the United States has j
no interest.
It is said that the United States j
should enter the League to aid the j

I cause of peace, but this is very
foolish. Everybody knows that the
; United States is not a warlike na
i tion. Its only wars (except the last)
have been fought to extend its na
tural boundaries, and the vast ma
i jority of the people now do not covet
j any foreign territory. The United
States is a greater moral force for
' peace out of the League and its
! wrangling than in it.

People of the type of Mr. Chester
Rowell, a most intelligent man and
one whose articles should be read
I by all, ai'e too idealistic. Everybody
! wants peace and harmony unless he
I is insane. The League is doubtless a
j step in the right direction. It is good
, for Europe, but not for the United
States for the reason given above.

our members in the Assembly (or j
our member on the Council) would j
vote, it would cause discord at home. !
In short, the European jealousies j
would be transferred to the United j
States, where there are people from
all the countries of Europe. It can
not be denied that a person born in,
say, Germany, or of German parent
age, would sympathize with that |
country. Hence, if American reprc- !
sentatives at the League voted I
against Germany on some question, j
there would be a great outcry in the j
United States among such persons.
It may be remarked that the |
League of Nations is not a world !
league, but a European league, dom
inated by the big powers of Europe
and confronted primarily by prob- ;
lems in which the United States has j
no interest.
It is said that the United States j
should enter the League to aid the j

I cause of peace, but this is very
foolish. Everybody knows that the
; United States is not a warlike na
i tion. Its only wars (except the last)
have been fought to extend its na
tural boundaries, and the vast ma
i jority of the people now do not covet
j any foreign territory. The United
States is a greater moral force for
' peace out of the League and its
! wrangling than in it.

People of the type of Mr. Chester
Rowell, a most intelligent man and
one whose articles should be read
I by all, ai'e too idealistic. Everybody
! wants peace and harmony unless he
I is insane. The League is doubtless a
j step in the right direction. It is good
, for Europe, but not for the United
States for the reason given above.

MORE ON THE WORLD COURT
The Editor, Sir:

At last there has arisen some dis
cussion on the subject of the League
of Nations and the World Coust. I
have till now refrained from ex
pressing myself in print on this sub
ject; but, now that I lind that my
opinions are to some degree also
held by Mr. Mellinkoff and Mr.
Monteagle, I think it is fitting that
I should say something.

Mr. Mellinkoff is quite right in |
saying that many intelligent people I
do not oppose the League and Court j
because of Hearst's wild statements.
It seems that if there are six good !
reasons for. opposing anything, 1
Hearst gives six bad reasons for op- j
posing it. Hearst is probably right i
in doing this, for his six bad reasons
will appeal to the majority of his j
readers. Hearst, however, is not al- i
ways wrong, as many think; and he j
deserves much credit for fighting the !
League and the Court.
There are many reasons for oppos- j
ing the League. One does not have :
to consider at all the famous Article 1
X of the Covenant of the League, j
Mr. Coolidge in his autobiography
gives probably the best reason why |
the United States should not join Lhe j
League. He says that whatever way '
our members in the Assembly (or j
our member on the Council) would j
vote, it would cause discord at home. !
