# PUBLIC OPINION IS IMPORTANT
## 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
I object to Mr. Muller's statement
! in The D:iily that pacifists refuse to
i take steps toward the abolition of
< wax - . As was stated in a previous let
; ter, the principal method used by
pacifists is that of educating the
| public; surely this is a definite and
j important step. He further implies
j that pacifists refuse to face the facts.
| This accusation is undoubtedly ap
i plicable to many pacifists, but it is
i hardly justified with regard to them
las a whole. Kirby Page has pub
! lished an astounding collection of
i facts, and statistics in his recent
i book, "National Defense," yet he
I has not found it necessary to depart
j from his pacifism. In fact, Mr. Mul
j ler's discredit of a close correlation
j between the increase of armament
i and the outbreak of war, seems to
; disclose a refusal on his part to ac
] cept the facts of history.
Mr. Doudoroff's letter is interest.-
I ing, but his comparison between
j crime and war is hardly accurate.
! Public opinion has often influenced
I the actions of a government, and has
proved its own potentialities as a
! controlling force. His ironical sug-
I gestion that I should advocate So
j cialism is perhaps more apt than he
! realizes.
Sincerely,
