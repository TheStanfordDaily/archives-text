COLLEGE—A BOON FOR THE
MARRIAGE INSTITUTION
(The lllini Weekly)
A ymter in a recent issue of a
j well-known periodical subtitled her
j article: "If the divorce courts de
pended on campus-made romance
they would soon go out of exist
! ence "
Statistics presented demonstrated
J that of all the marriages entered I
into in this country, one out of every 1
i nine resulted in divorce, while of
! those particular ones which had
i their inception in campus romance
J or the parties to which were college
i people meeting shortly after they
j had ended their academic work, but
j one in 75 ended in the divorce
I courts.
Without noting in detail the nu-
I merous reasons for the success of
! college-born life contracts, we can
I point out those which are manifest,
| and delete those which belong to
! psychological theory.
To begin with, the college man and
| woman are much on the same plane,
j They are on the same level not only
| as regards intelligence, but in tastes, 1
dress, manner, and associations. By
j this "level" we mean a group plane, j
| on which there may be great varia
i tions, but whose each and every
! component is nevertheless within
' the circle.
Because college men are forced to
i a recognition of woman on an intcl
i lectual plane, they come to recog
! nize her, in. her other activities, as j
I an individual personality. They see
| her intelligence recognized in the :
! classroom, her ability in fields of ;
campus activity, and her freedom in |
the break from parental restraint
which the average co-ed experiences
j when she comes to live in the at- i
j mosphere of sorority or dormitory
| life.
II is obvious that the average col
| lege student cannot but help be j
broadened by his or her contact ,
with such a large group of the same
| age. Because opportunity so pre
i sents itself, and because the indi
vidual will not allow himself to be
' segregated, there cannot arise the
! petty jealousies and narrow-minded- J
j ness that is common among those |
who mature in communities where
there are no such opportunities pre
sented.
Because of this opportunity of i
meeting such a large and eligible
group, both the young lady and
: young man have a chance to study
and select those whom they intend
to make their life partners. Because
they have such a wide variety of
| subjects, and because through their
! freedom they become skilled in
j reading personalities, their judg
| ments ai'e not formed on an over
night acquaintanceship, and they
are not likely to go awry.
All taken together, it appears that
the one great reason for the success
j of the college romance marriage is
| common understanding, which is in
a sense a co-ordination of all the
other reasons. This common under
standing relates to all matters —
, financial, because the parties learn
they must live within a common
i means or seek those who will live
! with them within such means; and
to social, intellectual, and personal
; relationships because of reasons al
| ready mentioned.
If institutions of higher learning
did little else than to give their stu
' dents such values in the art of liv
, ing together they would still justify
| their existence. Somehow, we be
lieve that higher education is in a
sense doing its real job in providing
the environment that makes for a
' happy life, even though it may be
! doing the lask unconsciously.
