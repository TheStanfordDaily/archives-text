Good old Stanford college has 110
end of troubles. Thirty thousand
stone for gates; who knows how
much for athletes? Depression has
cut the amount to be counted on for
syllabus fees; women are still
screaming for cash for furnishings,
equipment, and more wax for the
dance floor; and now this immense
grass fire displays, distinctly like a
sore thumb, that Stanford's own
Cedro College has no fire protec
tion. v
Once again the ghost of Mrs.
Stanford rises to complain of
something that is going on years
after it came into being. Cedro
Cottage used to be her summer
home. No\V one of our choicest
professors, with quantities of
family, lives there. If we have
another grass fire, the whole
place may burn down. It looks
like that 115 dollar tuition is due
for another boost.
Once again Stanford's own have
had the fear of God and sex aroused
in their hearts. The sturdy president
yesterday issued the complete list of
regulations who, when, and how
many chaperones are necessary for
any good, clean party.
For some inexplicable reason, the

! list of chaperones must be submitted
to the Dean of Women for due con
sideration three days before the
opening gun is fired. More import
ant, however, is the rule that the
; cbaperone list must include three
women, at least (wo of whom are
connected with the* University;
someone is hinting darkly, obvious
ly, that moral standards of women
not connected with the University
i can hardly be considered to be above
reproach. What a break for the 500!
A few difficult problems fared
the women in the office last Sun-
I day when they were trying to
throw enough readable copy to
gether to issue the annual mis
take, the Women's Edition. Na
turally enough, the sports de
partment had the most trouble.
One of the star Westbrook-Peg
j lers-for-the-day struggled and
j thrashed with the typewriter for a
! matter of hours, in an attempt to
I inform Monday morning's readers
: what happened at the track meet in
I the South Saturday.
Finally, stuck hopelessly at a key
point in the yarn, she silenced the
; busy office with the despairing an
: guish in her voice when she wailed:
"Is Aebersold a Stanford man,
i or is it U.S.C.?"
