## DIVOT DOPE 
### 
Divotces of the Royal and An
ient pastime on the Farm are proud
if the wealth of golf talent available
within the ranks of the registered,
md the manner in which the var
ity team cleaned up everything in
ight until the recent Oregon match
s gave reason enough to be proud,
nosing the Pacific Coast team title
th■ Webfoots bv two strokes was
bitter pill for' Cardinal golf to
wallow, yet no collegiate team in
he country should feel particularly
■ad about suffering a setback at the
lands of the Lemon Yellow and
Ireen shot makers.
Those boys in the Northland liter
l!y live on a golf course. Most of
hem are from Portland, birthplace
f some of the nation's best, prob
bily the most golf-minded village
:i the United States. Figures show
hat it has more golf courses per
•erson than any other city, and the
lumber of star players there prob
bly follows in the same proportion,
lad Oregon lost to the redshirted
nvaders, they would have had .111
iibi in thai their Don Moe, who
epresented this country on the
Valker Cup team, did not play
gainst Stanford. With Moe in the
neup, Cardinal chances would have
•een almost nil.
Don Moe used to be a caddy at
Vaverly Country Club in Portland,
nd at the tender age of 14 was
apable of threatening par on, any
Tan's course. Don hits a tremendous
I ive, and his short game is steady,
to is probably the most experienced
oliege golfer in the country, and his
xperience hasn't gone for nothing.
Ie is cool under the most trying
ond it ions, and has a habit of com
ig through y/hen least expected to
0 so.

Vincent Dolp, U. of O.'s second
est, likewise packed clubs when a
oungster, as did George Will, third
lar for the Green. Besides his na
lonally known brother, Frank, Vin
ent has another brother, Al, who
?es oil from the port side. His sister
also a star, making the famous
>olp family a threat in both sexes,
don't know about the remaining
layers on the Webi'oot team, but in
II probability most of them, too,
,ere born in Oregon with golfing
poons in their mouths.

Yesterday afternoon, Stanford's
olf course suffered a terrific beat
lg. The entire coaching staffs of
California and Stanford took an af
arnoon off to engage in a blind
ogey tournament. Though the golf
dent present was somewhat ques
onable, no one can doubt that some
f the great master minds in this
nr land, on football, baseball, bas
etball, and track were digging up
he tender turf on the local links,
iesides the galaxy of coaches, sev
ral of the moguls who handle foot
all dollars for the two institutions
/ere present.

Here are a few that were engaged
1 the divot digging; they need no
itroduction: Pop Warner, Nibs
'rice, Dink Templeton, Walter
'hristie, John Bunn, Harry Wolter,
'lint Evans, Bill Monahan, Al Mas
•rs, and a host of assistants. The
uge handicap ratings carried by
lost of these famous gentlemen is
ut another weighty argument in
ivor of specialization in sport.
