# HEC DYER SURPASSES MORRIS KIRKSEY AS FASTEST SPRINTER LN FARM HISTORY

### MICHAEL CROFOOT 
Emtok's Notk: This is the second of a series of articles dealing with the,
great track and field stars who have represented Stanford during Dink Temple
ton's regime. Sprinters hold the stage today.

One doesn't have to go back into
past history to find the fleetest of
Cardinal sprinters, because he is a
member of this year's track team—
Hector Dyer.
Long-striding, slow-starting Hec
has won so many races and laurels
in his three seasons as an Indian
mainstay that he has taken from
Morris Kirksey the title of Stanford's
greatest sprinter.
Primarily a competitive runner,
Hurrying Hector has made his best
times when racing his great rival,
Wykoff. In 1930 he was clocked at 9.6
seconds for the 100-yard dash as he
led "Flying Frankie" to the tape in
the Trojan dual meet. In this year's
U.S.C. meet he beat Wykoff in the
220 in 21.3 seconds.
Wins All Furlongs
Renewal of the Dyer-Wykoff
sprint duel this year has proved the
latter to be the better 100-yard dash
man. Thrice Hec has trailed Frankie
by a yard or so in 9.5 centuries. To
make up for it he has won every
220-yard dash he has entered this
season, including the ones in which
Wykoff toed the mark.
The best illustration of Dyer's
competitive abilities is his record in
the 1.C.4-A. In 1929 he took second
in both the 100 and 220. Last year
he won the furlong and finished
second to Wykoff in the shorter
sprint. Eddie Tolanfi, famous Michi
gan negro, was bested in both events.

The career of Morris Kirksey in
; many respects parallels that of Dyer.,
Like Hec, his greatest rival was a
j U.S.C. man, Charlie Paddock. Kirk
' sey never did beat Paddock, but he
j forced him to hun the then world
j record times of 9.6 and 21 fiat dur
| ing the 1920 season. The best times
I in which Kirksey himself ever broke
I the tape were 9.8 and 21.4. Pulled
j muscles kept him from 1.C.4-A. tri
l umphs on two occasions, but he did
! win the collegiate century crown in
' 1921.
Outside of Paddock, another Stan-
I ford sprinter, Eddie Sudden, gave
Kirksey his closest races. Fastest
clockings on Sudden were 9.9 and
j 21.6. Between Kirksey and Dyer ex
i tends a long line of dependable
j even-time sprinters, capable but not
j brilliant. Hartranft, Campbell, Rich
: man, Hale, and Lauritzen were the
"standai'd bearers during this period.
Hables Next
Alvin (Les) Hables, who is in the
| midst of his first year of competi
j tion for Stanford at the present time,
; may prove to be the man to fill Hec
Dyer's shoes in 1932. Ineligible for
j the varsity in 1930, he repeatedly
i beat Hec in practice. His best marks
j are 9.5 (in a wind) and 21.2, better
than Dyer's but in fast company he
i has not been the equal of "Hurrying
Hector." What a great natural run-
J ner Les is can be judged from his
: 47.8 lap for the Cards' record-setting
j relay team two weeks ago.

great track and field stars who have represented Stanford during Dink Temple
ton's regime. Sprinters hold the stage today.

One doesn't have to go back into
past history to find the fleetest of
Cardinal sprinters, because he is a
member of this year's track team—
Hector Dyer.
Long-striding, slow-starting Hec
has won so many races and laurels
in his three seasons as an Indian
mainstay that he has taken from
Morris Kirksey the title of Stanford's
greatest sprinter.
Primarily a competitive runner,
Hurrying Hector has made his best
times when racing his great rival,
Wykoff. In 1930 he was clocked at 9.6
seconds for the 100-yard dash as he
led "Flying Frankie" to the tape in
the Trojan dual meet. In this year's
U.S.C. meet he beat Wykoff in the
220 in 21.3 seconds.
Wins All Furlongs
Renewal of the Dyer-Wykoff
sprint duel this year has proved the
latter to be the better 100-yard dash
man. Thrice Hec has trailed Frankie
by a yard or so in 9.5 centuries. To
make up for it he has won every
220-yard dash he has entered this
season, including the ones in which
Wykoff toed the mark.
The best illustration of Dyer's
competitive abilities is his record in
the 1.C.4-A. In 1929 he took second
in both the 100 and 220. Last year
he won the furlong and finished
second to Wykoff in the shorter
sprint. Eddie Tolanfi, famous Michi
gan negro, was bested in both events.

The career of Morris Kirksey in
; many respects parallels that of Dyer.,
Like Hec, his greatest rival was a
j U.S.C. man, Charlie Paddock. Kirk
' sey never did beat Paddock, but he
j forced him to hun the then world
j record times of 9.6 and 21 fiat dur
| ing the 1920 season. The best times
I in which Kirksey himself ever broke
I the tape were 9.8 and 21.4. Pulled
j muscles kept him from 1.C.4-A. tri
l umphs on two occasions, but he did
! win the collegiate century crown in
' 1921.
Outside of Paddock, another Stan-
I ford sprinter, Eddie Sudden, gave
Kirksey his closest races. Fastest
clockings on Sudden were 9.9 and
j 21.6. Between Kirksey and Dyer ex
i tends a long line of dependable
j even-time sprinters, capable but not
