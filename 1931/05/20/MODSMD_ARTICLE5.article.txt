# SOLON REJECTS CANNON'S PLEA
## Campaign Fund Trial Must Start September 18 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 19. (/P) â€”A
request by Bishop James Cannon,
Jr., for postponement until Septem
ber 20 of the Senate inquiry into his
use of campaign funds was denied
today by Chairman Nye of the Sen
ate Investigating Committee because
the statute of limitations, against
prosecution in the case would begin
on September 18.
"In view of these facts," Senator
Nye wrote the bishop of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church South, "it
would appear that the committee
might incur a grave responsibility
if it did not resume its hearings prior
to that date."
The Senate committee is investi
gating a complaint by Representa
tive Tinkham, Republican, Massa
chusetts, that Bishop Cannon failed
to account for a major portion of the
$65,300 given to him as chairman of
the Anti-Smith committee in Vir
ginia in 1928 by E. C. Jameson, New
York financier.

Yesterday Bishop Cannon called
on Senator Nye and, the Senator
said, asked for a delay in the hear
ings by the Senate committee until
September 20, explaining he would
probably be out of the country until
that time.
