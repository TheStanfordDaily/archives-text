# 'IRON MAN' STUNT NOT FOR EASTMAN IN EASTERN MEET
## Team To Be Named Today; Smith, Dyer Already On Way East 
### Lowell Cox 
With Saturday set as the date for
the departure of Stanford's track
team for the 1.C.4-A. championships
at Philadelphia, Dink Templeton is
! still undecided as to how to use his
| "blond hope," Ben Eastman.
| Eastman is a certainty to take first
j in either the quarter-mile or the
j 880, but Templeton does not intend
; to run him in both events.
I "Ho might be able to get away
J with two events if the meet was
j being held on the coast; v - Templeton
! said last night, "but I wouldn't think
| of running him in both races in the
East."
Will Probably Run 410
It then becomes a question of in.
! which event Eastman will be the
| most valuable to Stanford, and that j
j would appear to be the 440. Soui.h- I
ern California, looming as the fa
j vorite to win the meet, is stronger ;
j in the shorter event, and Ben would
j hurt them more in that than in the
! half.
Unhampered by having to com- j
' pete in other events, it is quite pos- j
| sible that Eastman would step out ;
ito beat the world's quarter-mile '
I record he tied last week at Los
i Angeles. On the other hand, while
I "Blazing Ben" is certain to set a new [
| mark in the 880 before he finishes !
i his career, Templeton has several j
i times said that he probably will not
I let him try it before next season.
May Explode Jinx
Another reason why Templeton !
might be expected to choose the 440
for Eastman is the fact that while
the "boy coach" has produced a .
number of stars in the one-lap race, j
none of them has taken first in |
the 1.C.4-A. Even Bud Spencer was (
nosed out at the tape, and Dink no 1
doubt would like to explode the 1
"jinx" that he has dogged the steps !
I of his quarter-milers in the East.
Templeton announced yesterday j
i that he will name the squad today '
| that will depart for Philadelphia j
: Saturday. He is expected to take j
; about 17 men, with the following j
: almost certain to make the trip: j
I Smith, Dyer, Eastman, Les Hables, j
I West, George Gray, Nellie Gray, i
McLeod, Laborue, Jones, Raj', and I
| DeGroot. Among those who are also
i likely to get tickets are Brown, Nes- 1
! bit, Brugman, Ike Hables, Butler, j
I and Lombardi.
Smith, Dyer Leave
Smith and Dyer, prevented from i
| practicing by leg injuries, depailed ■
• 'or the East last night to spend sev- j
| oral days sight-seeing before the
j rest of the squad arrives.
Meanwhile Dean Cromwell has al- |
ready announced he will take 21 !
men to Philadelphia, including 29'4
of the points which won the
meet for the Trojans last year. The
list includes Wykoff, Maurer, Dolby,
Williams, Woesner, Fitzmaurice, Mc
| Geah, Halstead, Callahan, Payne,
j Carls, Stokes, Berry, Hall, Barber,
| Stewart, McNaughton, Brannon,
I Grager, Chlenztos, and McKenzie.
West Surprises
Templeton's charges again took it
; easy in practice yesterday, but will
! probably get down to serious work
! today. The most surprising feature
| of yesterday's workout was a leap of
j G feet 3 inches by Arnie West in
the high jump.
| West, who has been handicapped
j all season in his favorite event, the
| broad jump, because of injuries, may
I yet come through in the 1.C.4-A. in
j the other jumping event, if yester
-1 day's performance is any criterion. \
