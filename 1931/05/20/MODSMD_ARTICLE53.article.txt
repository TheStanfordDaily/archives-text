' hibition with the famous tennis
queen, playing at least-one, and pos-
I sibly two, sets of singles. Neer, who

appear with Mrs. Moody last Janu
: ary, but was unable to keep the en
gagement.
j Mrs. L. A. Harper, high ranking
j player in the national ratings, took

I the courts against the mixed team
I of Mrs. Moody and Neer in one set

' nis Club this month, and won the
I mixed doubles title at the present
I Ojai tournament.
I
j Credit for today's exhibition is due

collegiate tennis now under way.
Portable bleachers have already
| been set up on both sides of the
I exhibition court, and these, com-
I
I bined with the permanent structure
i at one end, are expected to handle
j the large crowd. Eager fans were
i forced to stand or sit on the edge of
the court in the January appearance
after all seating capacity had been
