# HAWKINS-GLEDHILL DOUBLES WIN OVER RICHMOND-STEPHENS
## 
### 
In the most spectacular match of
the mixed doubles play to date,
Betts Hawkins and Keith Gledhiil
defeated Mary Lee Richmond and
Trow Stephens yesterday afternoon
by a score of 7-9, 8-6, 6-1.

Richmond and Stephens, opening
up their attack early in the first set,
could not gain a decided advantage
until after the score had been car
ried to deuce games. In the next set
they had a 4-1 lead on their oppon
ents before Hawkins and Gledhiil
woke up to the seriousness of their
position, and recovered sufficiently
to take the set. The last set was
short and decisive.
Betty Dunlap and Ted Easton en
countered little difficulty in their
march to the semi-finals. They de
feated Janet Blethen and Lyndon
Farwell in straight sets. The score
was 6-3, 6-4.
The two other quarter-finals
matches which were scheduled for
yesterday were postponed until to
day.
