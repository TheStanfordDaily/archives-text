# [illegible]A.C. FRAMES NEW BIG GAME TICKET SYSTEM
## Students Must Apply For Cardboard Privileges During Summer [illegible] ADDRESS NEEDED [illegible] Rules Do Not Affect Class Of '31 Grads 
### 
With the intent, this year, to give
udents and alumni equal oppor
inities to procure tickets to the Big
ami 1 , the Ticket Department of the
>aid of Athletic Control yesterday
sued a complete revision of regu
tions for applications. Students, as
ell as alumni, will be required now
apply for tickets during the sum
er.
The former scheme, frequently re
sed, but generally insisting on the
ceipt of alumni applications during
e summer and student applica
nts after October 1, has not proved
tisfactory. When there were not
lough tickets to supply all those
itli equal rights, it sometimes hap
•ned that alumni who applied in
ugust would receive refunds, while
udents who applied in October
ould receive tickets.
Six New Rules
In order to ovei'come all the dif
:ulties that have arisen, and to dis
ibute the tickets 011 a more equi
ble basis, the following changes
ive been made:
1. All additional tickets other
an rooters' tickets must be ap
icd for during the summer at the
me time as the alumni apply.
2. All alumni who have attended
anford for three quarters or more
id have paid their dues in the
lumni Association and all students
ill be grouped in one classification.
To lie Filled hi Order
3. Applications will be filled with
this group as they are received
the Board of Athletic Control,
pplications should therefore be
ed immediately upon receipt.
i. Student applications will
l»e mailed only to those students
\\ ho come to the office of the
hoard of Athletic Control in
person or write to the office re
questing" that an application be
sent. He must at that time leave
an address at which he can he
reached between the dates of
July 15 and July 30. at which
time application will be mailed.
The responsibility of filing this
address with the Board of Ath
letic Control is left entirely to
the student.
Use nf Tickets
5. For the California-Stanford
me these additional tickets may
• used as follows: If the applicant
es one of them personally, he will
>t be able to purchase a rooters'
•ket. Only one of the two extra
•kets may be used by a member
the applicant's immediate family,
the future, the Board of Athletic
mtrol will automatically blacklist
y student who gives or sells at :
y price, or offers to do so, any j
•ket to any unqualified person. j
lis rule distinctly forbids the sale,
irchase or gift of these tickets 1
>m one student *to another.
6. Rooters' tickets will be sold to j
adents at the A.S.S.U. office after
gistration in the fall.
Graduates of June, 1931, will not
