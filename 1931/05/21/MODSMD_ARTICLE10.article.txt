# GENEVA NAMED AS SCENE FOR PEACE PARLEY
## League Council To Gather Data On Armaments For Conference 
### 
GENEVA, May 20 (/J J ). â€” The
League of Nations Council decided
today that the general disarmament
conference next February would be
held in Geneva, and then debated
provisions of a projected general dis
armament treaty.
Today's discussion involved the
principle of limiting trained re
serves and war materials and arose
over the form of questionnaire
which individual states would be
asked to answer preparatory to next
year's conferences. The purpose of
these documents would be to dis
close the present state of each coun
try's armaments.

Defer Action

Further consideration was post
poned until Friday after it was
learned Italy no longer supported
Germany.
The German view, as outlined by
Foreign Minister Julius Curtius, was
that the status of war materials on
hand and trained reserves should be
covered in the questionnaire form.
Arthur Henderson, British Foreign
Minister, recalled that this principle
was rejected by the preparatory
arms commission.

Italy's Opinion

Dino Grandi, Italian Foreign Min
ister, asserted the question should
not be reopened. He supported Hen
derson, who had suggested a tabular
from harmonizing with the provi
sions of the draft convention pro
duced by the preparatory commis
sion. Previously Italy had backed
the German stand at the prepara
tory commission.

Aristide Briand also voiced voiced
France's support to Henderson and
opposed limiting of trained reserves.
