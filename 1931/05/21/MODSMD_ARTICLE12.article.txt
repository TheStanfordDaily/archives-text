## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 20. (/P)—Joseph i
B. Eastman, member of the 1.C.C., !
declared in a speech before high •
railroad officials today he believed
'"it would be quite possible to evolve j
a plan of complete government re
sponsibility for the transportation
service which would retain most of
the merits of private initiative." ;
His qualified indorsement of gov- ;
ernment control of railroads was de
livered at a luncheon of the Traffic ,
Club.
Eastman advocated the creation of 1
a new federal bureau for the pur
pose of studying transportation de
fects and proposing remedies. He
particularly* criticized the present
rate structure which, he said, is
based, not on particularized costs,
but on what the traffic will bear.
