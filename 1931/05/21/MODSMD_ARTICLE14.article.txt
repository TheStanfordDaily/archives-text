NEW YORK, May 20 (/P).—As the
i leading nations of the world con- j
cern themselves with steps to sta
; bilize the price of silver production !
j if the metal continues to decline,
; the American Bureau of Metal Sta
| tistics reported today.
The April output in the United i
, States was the smallest for any
I month in recent years, says the bu
j reau, and world production in the
j first quarter fell off 20 per cent from
; the comparable period in 1930. The
i bureau's figures place April produc
| tion in the United States at 2,858,000
i fine ounces compared with 3,528,000
in March and 4.727,000 in April,
1930. The monthly average produc
i aon has held above 4,000,000 ounces
for at least five years.
Complete figures lor the principal
j producing countries compiled by
1 the bureau show the total output
during the first quarter was 44,198,- ;
,000 fine ounces, a drop of 11,278,000 |
: ounces or 20.3 per cent from the
! comparable period a year ago.

in curtailing production of silver
j which to a large extent is mined as
! a by-product of other metals such
• as lead, zinc and copper. The United ,
I States showed the largest decline in
the first four months compared with (
I a like period a year ago, production '
fell from 19,539,000 ounces "to 13,-
