# FLAMES SWEEP UPPER FLOORS OF ROW HOUSE
## Alpha Delta Phi Damages Estimated at $2,000; Men Move Out 
### 
Fire of undetermined origin broke
out in the Alpha Delta Phi house
at about 1 o'clock yesterday, de
stroying large parts of the roof and
doing damage estimated by Fire
Chief R. E. Dugan at nearly $2,000.
The fire was confined to the roof,
but most of the damage was done
by water and breakage. Supposed
to have started between the roof
and the ceiling of the third floor,
the fire spread rapidly along the
rafters. â€¢As no one was in the upper
region of the house at the time, the
fire gained quite a headway before
it was discovered.
Flames Out Soon
Campus firemen, aided by Alpha
Delts, cut away pieces of the roqf
and were able to extinguish the
flames in about half an hour.
Many of the members' personal
effects were damaged by being
tossed from the windows of the up
per stories, much to the amusement
of the large crowd that surrounded
the house. Downstairs furniture
was carried to safety,' though some
in the upper floors was damaged by
water.
Upstairs Demolished
The complete upper floors of the
house are wrecked, and members
are moving out until the end of the
quarter, when the damage can be
repaired.
The only other campus fire yes
terday was a small grass fire be
tween the Stanford Convalescent
home and the new hospital. Fire
Chief Dugan warns students to be
unusually careful in throwing away
burning matches and tobacco, as the
season is the dryest in years.
