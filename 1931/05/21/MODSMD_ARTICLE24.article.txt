# ATMOSPHERE CHANGE CAUSES HEAVY HEAT ON PACIFIC COAST
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. May 20. (/P>—
The scourge of blistering heat,
bringing disastrous fires, that has
caused all northern California to
swelter the past three days has been
due, partly, to atmospheric condi
tions caused by heavy snows and
sub-freezing temperatures that have
frosted peaks in the Rocky Moun
tain states, weather bureau officials
here said today.
With 14 inches of snow capping
Pike's Peak in Colorado, and snows
sweeping Utah, North Dakota, and
Minnesota, United States weather
authorities found a contributing
cause, at least, for the searing winds
lhat have swept into California over
the Siskiyous.
And they found, too, some hope
of respite. There was evidence to
night, of the heat abating and the
low humidity that has permitted
serious fires to sweep all sections is
expected to rise.
