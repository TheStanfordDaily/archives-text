# THE 						DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA

On I lie fronl page of The Daily today is printed an out
line of the Hoard of Athletic Control's latest plan to solve
the football ticket distribution problem. The essence of
the whole tiling is that students and alumni will apply at
the same time for all tickets, the applications to be made;
some time during the summer. The provision that one of
the two extra tickets purchased by students must be used
bv a member of bis immediate family is incidental, since
that ruling can and will be disregarded with ease.
That tin awful scream will arise from both students and
alumni as the result of the H.A.C.'s plan is a foregone con
clusion. Hut a close examination of the situation will
reveal that Ibis new schedule is about as fair as any that
can be produced, if the students and alumni are to be con
sidered as equally deserving of the coveted tickets.
The 8.A.C,. has tried other angles. For a while, the stu
dents were given first choice; then the alumni were handed
the preference. Last year the alumni were split into two
groups and the students sandwiched in between them. In
each case, the gripes, no matter from which group they
emanated, were long, Joud and tiresome.
One can argue all day on the question of whether the
student or the alumnus should be given the preference,
and, like the H.A.C., reach no satisfactory conclusion. The
logical answer, it seems, is to throw the field open to both
and devil take the hindmost. "And those who think that
it's a dirtv deal can advance their ideas on what to do with
17,000 tickets and .'{l,ooo applications.
