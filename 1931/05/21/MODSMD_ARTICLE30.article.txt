# CONTINUOUS LEADERSHIP NEEDED
## 
### 
Last Week Richard Grant, retiring president of the In
terfraternitv Council, criticized severely the work of the
council during the past year, describing liie regulation of
rushing during April as "worse than a farce.*' Grant sug
gested either a modification of the present rules or a "gen
tlemen's agreement" among the houses to observe the reg
ulations.
The "gentlemen's agreement" did not work this year.
Modification would mean in the end a return to the cut
throat rushing of the past. Neither seems desirable. The
rules are there, and most of the fraternities want them en
forced. Rut none of them want to take the initiative in
making the system of regulated rushing, supposedly in
force here, work.
What Stanford fraternities have always lacked is a
leadership that carried over from year to year. The presi
dent of the Interfraternitv Council is in office for just one
year. The president of the Interfraternitv Board of Con
trol holds office for the same period. If there are strong
men in office, for one bricf'Vear the two fraternity control
groups show a semblance of activity. Otherwise, their
very existence is doubtful.
This year the Council and the Board of Control con
sidered a permanent housing scheme for the living groups
and uniform plans for conducting fraternity finances. By
next year these two constructive programs for fraternity
betterment ;il Stanford may be forgotten. All because the
leadership changes so rapidly.
The Board of Control is composed of faculty and alumni
members, as well as students. Why not choose one of the
former as a president to direct year after year a consistent
policy in regards to fraternity affairs? With a leader on
the board for more than one year, and with the student
council co-operating with the board, the lime might per
haps come when regulated rushing at Stanford might not
be branded as farcical and the control groups as worse
than worthless.
