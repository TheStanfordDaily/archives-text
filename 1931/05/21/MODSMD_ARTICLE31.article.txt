# THE
						EX COMMITTEE ACTS
## 
### 
The action of the Executive Committee Tuesday eve
ning, in unanimously voting lo amend the A.S.S.I'. by-laws
to prohibit the candidacy of any student convicted of vio
lation of the Honor Code for any elective (tllice in the
student body deserves the highest commendation. The sit
uation in the spring election revealed the potential danger
which lurked before the imposition of this restriction.
Before this prohibition was made, it was possible for a
student who had been convicted of violating the Code to
be elected lo membership in Men's or Women's Council,
the two bodies charged with enforcement of tlie Honor
('ode. Thai danger has been removed.
In ;i few weeks, just before the present Councils go out
of ollice, the Honor Code will go through another lest of
its success as a guide lo student conduct. On .lime (>, the
first of the regularly scheduled final examinations will be
held. The last regular examination will be on June 10.
During the final examination period, the possibilities for
violation of the Code are greater than ;it any other time in
the quarter. In the days before the close of the quarter,
many reports and papers will be submitted in various
courses. In these the opportunities for violating the Code
are many. The present Councils can do much to counteract
some of their weak acts of the pas! by acting vigorously in
anv cases of violation as the vear ends.
