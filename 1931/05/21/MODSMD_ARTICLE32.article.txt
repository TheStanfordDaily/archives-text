It must be highly satisfying to be
victorious even if the thing won or
the foe vanquished is of no signifi
i cance. It is a common practice in
I boxing, politics, or other pursuits to
' triumph most grandly; but .often
| upon close examination it is found
| that the opposition was either non
existent or very, very meagre. We
all were treated to the sight of every
office seeker in, Los Angeles county
i from dog-catcher to councilman bas
| ing his election campaign on advo-
J cacy of Boulder Dam—for the simple
j reason that everybody favored the
I project in that region.
Recently in San Francisco (and

articles—abundant editorials—inter

fense and aid of the movement to
fasten the gorgeous title "Yerba
Buena" on humble little Goat Island.
1 Now few will deny that Yerba
j Buena is a fancy title to be sure.
Goat Island sounds so American—

j the sound of the gallant Spanish

dark-eyed senoritas —and all the

! for some society to conduct a big
j campaign to restore the island's an
i cient name, "Yerba Buena'"; it was
I a gallant move on the part of the
Ijjaper in question to rush to the
| support of the society which was
j fighting hard for the romance of the

VICTORY AT LAST!

! "fast-disappearing golden West."
On further thought, however, it

: much like a comic opera plot to
J have a metropolitan newspaper con

: change the name of a little plot of
! hilly ground in the bay. It is also
' very possible that after Washington
lis petitioned—and all the routine
| has been carried out, and maps have
| been changed to bear the melodious,
j rolling, foreign-sounding "Yerba
Buena," the people will continue
1 calling the ground in question "Goat
I Island"—the name that is familiar
| to them and which means something
; even if there are not goats on the
island.
It seems a growing characteristic
of metropolitan papers to spend
j more and more editorial space on
such controversial subjects as, "This
is raisin week—eat more raisins";
I "Our city is the best in the world";
i "Plant a tree this week —trees are
scarce," etc. In a vain endeavor to

j papers are casting away the power

j As long as newspapers spend vast
j amounts of editorial space on cham
