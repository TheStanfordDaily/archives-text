I
THAT WORTHLESS FELLOW
PLATANOV— By Anton Chehkov.
E. P. DuKon. $2.5(1.
Mikhail Vassllyevitch Platanov
would have liked to be a Hamlet
but the ladies insisted upon making
him a Don Juan. At one time he
i had no less than four intrigues on
his hands and dilemna was evident
on his face. Then when he kept none
iof the rendezvous that the ladies
' had made for him they proved a
I little unfriendly.
After three reconciliations the
vodka gave out and Platanov, feeling
ill, leaned heavily upon wench
Marya Efimova Grekova. Wherc
: upon his wife entered and, in a
j businesslike manner, plugged him
nicely above the floating rib, thereby
| ending the comedy.
! This posthumous tale written dur
ing Chekhov's student days takes
some time to start on its way, but
! when it does the amusement is akin
to that in Getting Gertie's Garter
and Up in Mabel's Room.
It is written in Chekhovian man
i ner and as representative of a Rus
sian attempt to Slavicize French
j boudoir drama—without losing that
; necessary gloom and philosophic
wrestling—it amuses.
Probably the only reason the bud_
i ding dramatist slaughtered his hero
so summarily is that Uncle Vanya
was evolving and he had to save the
non-firing gun trick for that.

MEN CALL IT LOVE—At the New
i Stanford Theatre.
Suddenly brightening up after
j three or four somewhat boresome
j reels, "Men Call It Love," now on
I the silver sheet at the New Stan
j ford, becomes really entertaining.
Although starred, Adolphe Meniou
! has a comparatively small part as a
j sympathetic villain. Action princi
j pally centers around the blonde and

attractive Leila Hyams, and Norman
Foster, both of whom give really
good performances.
, The story is merely the time-worn
triangle, dusted off a bit and given
a "modern" setting of cocktails and
divorce. "You either fall in love with
another woman's husband, or he's
just another woman's husband,
that's all," explains the "villainess"
—and Norman Foster wasn't just
another woman's husband.
A Laurel and Hardy comedy and
a Grantland Rice short liven the
program. "Men Call It Love" wili
rr\ove out tomorrow to make room
for George Arliss and his greatly
popular "millionaire," returning for
another engagement. —L.M.C.
NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET
—At the Varsity Theatre.
Unless the temperature drops
some 20 degrees in the next few
hours this picture with its South Sea
Island setting may not be popular.
It does not induce the correct men_
tal attitude for resisting heat waves.
As a picture it is not too bad. Les
lie Howard, who is not one of the
better known stars, shows consider
able promise as the young English
man who is nearly ruined by the
native charmer from the South Seas.
If this picture is true in every
detail the person who said that the
Charleston originated in Africa
either had a mental relapse or had
never heard of the South Seas.
Those brown-skinned huskies would
have won all the blue ribbons in
the heyday of that hectic dance.
The film's best shot was that of a
small tot giving Gilda Grey some
healthy competition.
An excellent comedy take-off on
the "Front Page" and an even bet
ter Mickey Mouse cartoon are worth
while seeing just for themselves, and
put one in a better humor for the
occasional sloppy bits in Ihe feature
film. „ —S.C.A.
