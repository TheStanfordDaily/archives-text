Lord, lord—what's the matter with
the world at large? First it was in
jured athletes, and now it's grass
fires. Crutches were O.K. for the
cripples, but it takes a couple of
Ford trucks and the entire journal
ism and chemistry departments to
remedy the fire trouble.
It's yetting dangerous to sleep
at night without a fire extin
guisher located beside the alarm
clock. Or even impossible to
read the latest nickel novel af
ter lunch, without having the
whole campus on your neck with
a hose and sack.

Witness the good-while-it_lasted
Alpha Delt lire yesterday noon,
which might have been a thorough
success if plans had been a littie
more carefully made. An expert
knows several inviolable rules about
starting a really effective lire. The
most important thing is that it
should be started in the basement,
and never on the top floor of a
building.
It's almost certain to be dis
covered when the roof starts
burning, and then someone al
ways is a poor enough sport to
want to put it out. In a cellar,
it can get well under way before
being discovered by the world,
unless it's one of those cellars
that people visit frequently on a
hot day.
Fact remains, this one was caught
in process and put out, despite the
efforts of the Encina Sponsor Sys
tem, which was public spirited
enough to hope the whole house
would burn, to provide free public
entertainment.
If this super-vigilance con
tinues, we'll have to go back to
Louie's for enjoyment. You've
all heard, at least, of the rocky
road to Menlo? Take it from us,
it's a lot rockier coming back.
We're still wondering whether
there were more clean blue shirts
or bags of golf clubs thrown out of
the second story windows, yesterday.
Public sentiment hands it to the
blue shirts. We'd hate to have to
putt straight with a club that had
been hurled with such violence,
even during a fire scare.
Particularly suited to the nice
weather we're having is a little
gem we picked lip out of the
street, yesterday—known as the
Song of the Icelanders: "F'recze
a jolly good fellow . . . ."

blue shirts. We'd hate to have to
putt straight with a club that had
been hurled with such violence,
even during a fire scare.
Particularly suited to the nice
weather we're having is a little
gem we picked lip out of the
street, yesterday—known as the
Song of the Icelanders: "F'recze
a jolly good fellow . . . ."
Lord, lord—what's the matter with
the world at large? First it was in
jured athletes, and now it's grass
fires. Crutches were O.K. for the
cripples, but it takes a couple of
Ford trucks and the entire journal
ism and chemistry departments to
remedy the fire trouble.
It's yetting dangerous to sleep
at night without a fire extin
guisher located beside the alarm
clock. Or even impossible to
read the latest nickel novel af
ter lunch, without having the
whole campus on your neck with
a hose and sack.

Witness the good-while-it_lasted
Alpha Delt lire yesterday noon,
which might have been a thorough
success if plans had been a littie
more carefully made. An expert
knows several inviolable rules about
starting a really effective lire. The
most important thing is that it
should be started in the basement,
and never on the top floor of a
building.
It's almost certain to be dis
covered when the roof starts
burning, and then someone al
ways is a poor enough sport to
want to put it out. In a cellar,
it can get well under way before
being discovered by the world,
unless it's one of those cellars
that people visit frequently on a
hot day.
Fact remains, this one was caught
in process and put out, despite the
efforts of the Encina Sponsor Sys
tem, which was public spirited
enough to hope the whole house
would burn, to provide free public
entertainment.
If this super-vigilance con
tinues, we'll have to go back to
Louie's for enjoyment. You've
all heard, at least, of the rocky
road to Menlo? Take it from us,
it's a lot rockier coming back.
We're still wondering whether
there were more clean blue shirts
or bags of golf clubs thrown out of
the second story windows, yesterday.
Public sentiment hands it to the
blue shirts. We'd hate to have to
putt straight with a club that had
been hurled with such violence,
even during a fire scare.
