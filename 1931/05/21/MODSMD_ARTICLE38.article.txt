ON BEING SPANKED
(Vassar Miscellany News)
, Those of us who listened in on the
speeches at the Freshman-Parents'
i Conference last Saturday had the
pleasure of hearing, from one of the
J speakers, that the students who
signed the petition about military
I training did not know what they
were doing and deserved to be
I spanked. The parents applauded
promptly and vigoi#>usly.
It was said furthermore than stu
, dents are susceptible to influence,
particularly along political lines, and
therefore teachers should be chosen
with this in mind. It was hoped that
Vassar students would noi get mixed
|up in Communistic and Socialistic 1
| theories, but would be "good, hon
| est-to-God Americans." Later a
| parent was heard to remark that we
| never had any work to do, so we
I had plenty of time to sit around
| picking up all these Communistic
| ideas.
Without going into the pros and I
cons of political theories', we would
| like to remind our elders who ap
! plauded the spanking proposition,
j or who think that we have nothing
! to do but ape the conversation of
I our faculty, that the basis of the
! learning process here is a thorough
I survey of facts, and a reasoned re
i synthesis of these facts into theories
j of cause and effect.
It is also a fundamental educa
i tional principle to correlate these
| assorted facts and theories; to see
| their relative importances in the
vista of past and present. It is un
avoidable that any student, follow
ing this program of study and re
flection, would include the subject
that any modern girl's reasoning
I that an ymodern girl's reasoning
would timidly skirt a field of such
prime importance in the world to_
I day.

A great many of us have had the
| experience, recorded in the recent
i Dramatic Production Play, of being
1 patted on the back and told not to
j bother our pretty heads with sub
jects we know nothing about; or of
being told patronizingly, that we are
too young to bear the burden of I he
world on our slender shoulders. As
| a matter of fact, we do bear the
j burden of the world on our shoul
i ders. In five years, we will all be
I votei's; many of us are old enough
to vote now. We have reached an
I age where, physiologists agree, we
j are mentally adult. And we have
j had more education relevanj. to citi
! zenship than most of the voters who
j are not students, and are therefore,
J popularly speaking, "grown-ups."
; Newspapers are read by college stu-
J dents as well as by business men.
| The non-partisan Vassar Political
! Association brings political leaders
i of various parties and nationalities
| here to speak. We are personally
! aware, both here and in our home
! towns, of current political and eco
| nomic issues. It is on this basis that
| we claim our rights to opinions.
As was pointed out later in Ihe
' Parents' Conference, the faculty
would have great difficulty in mak
\ ing political converts even if they
1 tried, which they seldom do. Pro
i fessors direct our study; they point
out those channels by which the
most useful information can be
gleaned; they help us to find the
essentials in the mass of material
at our disposal; they teach a tech
nique, and often inspire a love of
learning. But they do not affect the
! conclusions we draw. They do not
j provide us with the thread on which
| to string our beads. It is the sole
| right and privilege of scholars, real
ized most acutely by professors, to
make their own metaphor for the
reality they have perceived in poli
tical opinions is no exception to this
1 rule.
This is to assert that it is right
: and just for students to have and
] express opinions of their own, on

any subject at all. If, as a result of
our college education, we refuse to
die with the political convictions we
were born with, we are doing so
[much personal reasoning from our
j study of facts.

ON BEING SPANKED
(Vassar Miscellany News)

i Conference last Saturday had the
pleasure of hearing, from one of the
J speakers, that the students who
signed the petition about military
I training did not know what they
were doing and deserved to be
I spanked. The parents applauded
promptly and vigoi#>usly.
It was said furthermore than stu
, dents are susceptible to influence,
particularly along political lines, and
therefore teachers should be chosen
with this in mind. It was hoped that
Vassar students would noi get mixed
|up in Communistic and Socialistic 1
| theories, but would be "good, hon
| est-to-God Americans." Later a

| never had any work to do, so we
I had plenty of time to sit around

cons of political theories', we would

I our faculty, that the basis of the

I survey of facts, and a reasoned re
