C AUG 11T DEFENSELESS
The Editor, Sir:
Our broad-minded pacifistic friend j
from the suburbs of Mill Valley has !
crashed into the press again.
He is utterly squelched and caut*h(
defenseless by the arguments of
Messrs. Doudoroff and Muller, be
cause their arguments are based on
fact.
His are based on pure sophomorie
philosophy.
Sincerely,
J. K. Van Deventer
