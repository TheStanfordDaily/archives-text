beat out Ralph Giberson, his re
maining rival in this race, to cross i
the finish line in 9.9 seconds.
Brugman nosed out Nisbet in two j
flights of high hurdles, in the fair ;
time of 15.3. Butler had four broad i

IC4A last year, he has been unable '

maining rival in this race, to cross i
the finish line in 9.9 seconds.
Brugman nosed out Nisbet in two j
flights of high hurdles, in the fair ;
time of 15.3. Butler had four broad i
jumps over 23 feet, and A1 Ray was |

IC4A last year, he has been unable '
