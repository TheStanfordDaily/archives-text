# EL TIGRE DEFEATS THETA CHI, 16 TO 3
## 
### 
In a play-off of the triple tie m
League IV of mural baseball, El
Tigre reversed an earlier season loss
to Theta Chi yesterday by winning
Hi to 15. Wilson and Cohen were the
Tigre battery; for Theta Chi, Gil
lette, Howe, and Dole. Griffen hit a
home run with one on in the fifth
inning to account for two of Theta
Chi's runs.
On account of the limited time
left to finish the mural season, the
teams now tied for the leadership
of Leagues 111 and IV will play off
jointly, rather than determining in
dividual league winners. Thus El
Capitan from League 111 and Se
quoia from League IV meet today on
Ihe varsity diamond.
