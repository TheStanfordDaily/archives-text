### 
| Gracing the varsity courts once
! again w'th her presence, Mrs. Helen
I Wills Moody appeared in three ex
ihibition sets here yesterday after
noon. Phil Neer, former Stanford
I star and national intercollegiate
! champion of 10 years ago, played
| against the famous Helen, losing the
! one singles set by a 7-5 score.
With the count 5 all, Mrs. Moody
won her own serve and broke
: through Neer's to win the set. Her
backhand was working beautifully,
I and this stroke was no exception in
! the usual excellent game she dis
! plays. She has taken the courts
l against Neer so many times In the
1 past that each knows the other's'
! style of play to perfection.
' On account of the intense heat,
' only two sets of doubles were played
: against Gledhill and Easton, the Jn
' dian representatives in yesterday's
I exhibition. In the first set the two
teams ran yp neck and neck to 7 all,
j when.Mrs. Moody took her serve to
! make the count 8-7. She and her-

j partner broke through Easton's ser
■ vice in the next game, finally break
! ing the deadlock for a 9-7 win.
Gledhill and Easton, however,
''! were not to be beaten back twice,
; and the other set went the other
way. They had the visitors on the
j short end of a 4-1 score at one time,
j but lost two games to stand at 4-3.
! Gledhill then served a love game,
! Neer dropped his own service, and
j the set ended with a characteristic
) Easton di'ive that caught Neer in
: midcourt.
Stanford women were given an
j opportunity to meet Mrs. Moody at
j a tea sponsored by the Women's
I Block "S" Society in the lobby of
j the Roble Gymnasium following the
j matches. Members of the W.A.A.
; Boai'd and of the Women's "S" So-
