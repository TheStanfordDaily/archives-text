# ARMY AIRSHIPS CIRCLE CHICAGO
## Hundreds Of Planes Fly In War Maneuvers 
### 
CHICAGO, May 20
dreds of army war birds clustered j
about Chicago tonight, ready to j
show the city and its environs what '
they could do if the city were '
threatened by a hostile army.
More than 650 planes flew in from ;
Dayton and Cleveland, Ohio, to
day, most of them in formation, and
there was not a serious mishap de
spite the soggy condition of several 1
Chicago fields. Precautions were;
taken in landing, with the forma- \
tions bi'eaking up and filtering 1
slowly to the ground.
The demonstration, which had j
been planned for today as the cli- 1
max to Chicago's jubilee and which \
was postponed because of bad 1
weather yesterday, was scheduled i
for tomorrow, to be followed by the 1
flight back to the division's base at |
Dayton.
Forming over the west and north
west suburbs, the division was to j
start a parade down the lake front !
at Evanston at about 10 a.m., (C. j
D. T.) past a reviewing stand in
downtown Chicago, continue down j
the shore line to Gary and then !
strike off for Dayton.
The first group left Dayton, where 1
the corps had assembled and re- i
hearsed for its two weeks' demon- j
stration at 11 a.m., and was sighted j
over the Chicago Loop at 1:25. In j
all 568 ships left Dayton for the Chi- j
cago concentration. >
