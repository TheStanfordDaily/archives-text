# Dink Develops Spear, Jump Titans

### MICHAEL CROFOOT 
Editor's Note: Below is llio third of a group of articles reviewing the careers of the track stars developed
by Dink Tcmpleton. High jumpers, broad jumpers, and javelin throwers share the spotlight today.

They wore Sid Meeks (24'3"), Fred Zombro (24'10'),
and Knn Dyer (24'5"). Contemporaneously Jesse Hill
was making broad jump history at Troy. Stanford's
"three musketeers" were unable to beat him in the
dual meet or the IC4A, but they took three places
at Ihe latter meet and won numerous coast honors.
They go down in history with other famous Temple
ton triads, such as Kibby, Sparling, and Joaquin.
Virg Dowell (24'4") took up where they left off,
ably assisted by Arnie West (24'7"). The latter be
came the first Card to take an JC4A broad jump title,
when he got of! the best jump of his career at Cam
bridge last spring.
Here are a few of the javelin throwers developed
on the Farm during Dink's decade: Kibby, 210 ft.
in 1928; Sparling, 204 ft. in 1928; Joaquin, 202 ft. in
1927: Harlow, 201 ft. in 1925; Hanner, 197 ft. mi 1922;
Shipkey, 195 ft. in 1927. Only those are listed who
backed up their fine marks with fine competitive
records. Harlow was an IC4A champ, Sparling and
Kibby IC4A point-winners, Hanner a Pacific Co ist
record-holder who came within 3 inches of the
American record at that time.
It is somewhat ironical that events with such a
glorious past should be having such an inglorious
present. Stanford could have used a King or a Kibby
or a Zombro this year.

niNK TEMPLETON used to be a star in the jumps,
both high and broad, when he represented Stan
ford, so it is not surprising th;it he has developed
two 6 foot 5 inch high jumpers and five 24 foot broad
jumpers during his decade as Indian mentor.
Tom Work (15 ft. 5 7-20 in.) and Bob King/6 ft. ()•' ;
in.) are head and shoulders above the rest of the
high jumpers during Dink's regime. The former
made his mark in 1925, when he cleaned up the coast.
His highesi leap was made in the coast conference
meet of that year and set a new record.
Strangely enough Work was not the Indians' best
high jumper in 192 G. The reason for this was Bob
King, who had displayed great promise in 1925 with
a 6'3" leap as a freshman. He lived up to it by beat
ing Work and other cracks regularly during his
sophomore season, and setting a new IC4A record
of 6'5". In 1927 he was only able to place second in
the Eat J.
King had his "annus mirabilis'" in 1923. Unde
feated in competition all year he won not only the
intercollegiate but also the world's championship,
the latter as a member of the United States Olympic
team.
In 1927 three Indian athletes began to bring fame
to Stanford by leaping out 24 feet in every meet.

glorious past should be having such an inglorious
present. Stanford could have used a King or a Kibby
or a Zombro this year.

niNK TEMPLETON used to be a star in the jumps,
both high and broad, when he represented Stan
ford, so it is not surprising th;it he has developed
two 6 foot 5 inch high jumpers and five 24 foot broad
jumpers during his decade as Indian mentor.
Tom Work (15 ft. 5 7-20 in.) and Bob King/6 ft. ()•' ;
in.) are head and shoulders above the rest of the
high jumpers during Dink's regime. The former
made his mark in 1925, when he cleaned up the coast.
His highesi leap was made in the coast conference
meet of that year and set a new record.
Strangely enough Work was not the Indians' best
high jumper in 192 G. The reason for this was Bob
King, who had displayed great promise in 1925 with
a 6'3" leap as a freshman. He lived up to it by beat
ing Work and other cracks regularly during his
sophomore season, and setting a new IC4A record
of 6'5". In 1927 he was only able to place second in
the Eat J.
King had his "annus mirabilis'" in 1923. Unde
feated in competition all year he won not only the
intercollegiate but also the world's championship,
the latter as a member of the United States Olympic
team.
In 1927 three Indian athletes began to bring fame
to Stanford by leaping out 24 feet in every meet.
Editor's Note: Below is llio third of a group of articles reviewing the careers of the track stars developed
by Dink Tcmpleton. High jumpers, broad jumpers, and javelin throwers share the spotlight today.

They wore Sid Meeks (24'3"), Fred Zombro (24'10'),
and Knn Dyer (24'5"). Contemporaneously Jesse Hill
was making broad jump history at Troy. Stanford's
"three musketeers" were unable to beat him in the
dual meet or the IC4A, but they took three places
at Ihe latter meet and won numerous coast honors.
They go down in history with other famous Temple
ton triads, such as Kibby, Sparling, and Joaquin.
Virg Dowell (24'4") took up where they left off,
ably assisted by Arnie West (24'7"). The latter be
came the first Card to take an JC4A broad jump title,
when he got of! the best jump of his career at Cam
bridge last spring.
Here are a few of the javelin throwers developed
on the Farm during Dink's decade: Kibby, 210 ft.
in 1928; Sparling, 204 ft. in 1928; Joaquin, 202 ft. in
1927: Harlow, 201 ft. in 1925; Hanner, 197 ft. mi 1922;
Shipkey, 195 ft. in 1927. Only those are listed who
backed up their fine marks with fine competitive
records. Harlow was an IC4A champ, Sparling and
Kibby IC4A point-winners, Hanner a Pacific Co ist
record-holder who came within 3 inches of the
American record at that time.
It is somewhat ironical that events with such a
glorious past should be having such an inglorious
present. Stanford could have used a King or a Kibby
or a Zombro this year.
