Alpha Delt, laying hold on axe,
smashes upper and lower panes,
breaks sash between — then raises
mangled remnants of window, and
crawls under.
Brethren, similarly inspired, break
both panes trying to get out barrel
of goods, and when it won't fit, they
open the window and throw it out.
Dirty Alpha Delt, smoke-begrimed,
combing hair from mirror on front
lawn.

One of the curious boys on the
Row ran into the hall of the Alpha
Delt house to find the phone ringing
unanswered. He lifted the receiver
and in reply to the call for one of
the inmates, answered: "Sorry, he's
busy up stairs now, will you call
later?"
Sam Eastman marooned at front
eaves. Rescuers carry ladder to
back. Chuck Weesner, varsity ace
from a neighboring house, gathers
up Alpha Delt racquets appraisingly.
And then of course, the infallible
brother who carried the mattress
downstairs, and threw the dishes out
of the window ....
