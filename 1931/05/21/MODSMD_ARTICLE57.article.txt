## 
### 
"This season's most diverting fire,"
jas unanimous vote of the campus,
| gives top rank to the Alpha Deit
| holocaust which enlivened the cam
i pus noon-hour yesterday.
First symptoms—hasher running
i about the Alpha Delt front porch
with a pitcher of ice-water, to the
appreciative guffaws of.its proprie
tors—until they too began to smell
smoke.
With the fire definitely under way,
nearby houses rushed to the end of
| the imperiled Alpha Delts to help
! them remove removables and non
removables, but were stopped at the
i door by smart Bob Baumgarten say
| ing that only brothers were allowed
inside, suspecting God knows what.
Shoes, suitcases, tennis racquets,
; pictures, clothes, bedding, notc
i books flying out of upper bedroom
1 windows in a boundless enthusiasm
| that continued long after the fire
' was in hand. Brother stooping to
! pick up hopelessly scattered notes
I on lawn below, is bombarded with

. suitcase.

Alpha Delt, laying hold on axe, j
j smashes upper and lower panes, !
; breaks sash between—then raises
; mangled i-emnants of window, and .
i crawls under.
Brethren, similarly inspired, break |
j both panes trying to get out barrel j
j of goods, and when it won't fit, they i
! open the window and throw it out. j
Dirty Alpha Delt, smoke-begrimed, ;
combing hair from mirror on front I
lawn.

One of the curious boys on the j
j Row ran into the hall of the Alpha j
i Delt house to find the phone ringing i
' unanswered. He lifted the receiver !
| and in reply to the call for one of ,
j the inmates, answered: "Sorry, he's j
' busy up stairs now, will you call j
J later?"
j Sam Eastman marooned at front ,
1 eaves. Rescuers carry ladder to |
; back. Chuck Weesner, varsity ace
; from a neighboring house, gathers J
i up Alpha Delt racquets appraisingly. j
| And then of course, the infallible
I brother who carried the mattress 1
! downstairs, and threw the dishes cut j
' of the window .... I
