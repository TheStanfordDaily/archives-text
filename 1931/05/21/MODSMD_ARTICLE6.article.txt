# SAVINGS BANK HEADS DEMAND LEGISLATION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20. (/I 3 )â€” A :
demand that state legislatures and !
congress enact legislation to segre- '
gate savings from commercial bank 1
deposits was made before the Na- ,
tional Association of Mutual Sav- .
ings Banks today by its president, j
Thomas F. Wallace of Minneapolis. I
Noting that 6,000 commercial 1
banks had failed in the last decade j
compared with only two savings I
banks, Wallace said the invasion of !
the savings bank field by commer- I
cial banks and trust companies was j
"never justifiable from a sound eco- |
nomic standpoint, unless accom- |
panied by legislation which would ,
give to savings deposits in all such !
institutions the same protection that !
depositors in mutual savings banks j
now have.''
