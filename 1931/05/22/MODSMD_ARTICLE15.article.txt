# Montor, German Drama Wizard Tells Anecdotes
## 
### Beatrice Bishop 
Being taken for the latest and
long-searched-for murderer as he
sat in the subway repeating the
word "murder" with various into
nations and sinister expressions in
an effort to improve his interpreta
tion of the ghost in "Hamlet," is one
of the many interesting expriences
related by Max Montor, famous Ger
man actor, who read Goethe's
"Faust" to an intent campus audi
ence yesterday.
Many of his important and diffi
cult parts he studied on crowded
street cars, when time demanded it,
thus developing a high degree of
concentration, so valauble to his
work.
Montor has been called an ency
clopedia of drama because of the
prodigious amount of literature
stored in his mind. When asked if
parts he has memorized continually
come to his mind, he told of sur
prising himself by quoting, without
error, a monologue of 40 verses from
Schiller's "Don Carlos," which he

! had not read for at least 20 years.
"Walking along the street I often
start reciting, with closed lips, of
course; hut sometimes one word be
comes audible to the passers-by,
! and now and then I see in their
face some strange amazement."
Asked for the trick of his re
markable memory, Montor said he
had none—that his achievement was
the result of unceasing study since
his 16th year. He recalls easily «.
work once mastered.
The German actor started his un
usual task of reciting whole plays
during, the war. He likes to play his
I favorite parts—Hamlet, Richard 111,
Nathan the Wise, Masterbuilder Sol
ness, Cyrano de Bergerac—on the
stage, "but," he added, "I always
feel induced to «ive a full perform
ance of a whole play, building up
the meaning of the poet as seen
through the eyes of one individ-
I uality. There is no possibility of
i mixing characters ;:nd situations, be
cause I am 11vini» through the drama
i whenever I perform."
