# AIRMEN THRILL CHICAGO CROWD
## 600 Planes Participate As Army Stages Review 
### 
CHICAGO, May 21 (/P).â€”The
Army's fighting fleet of the air
passed in review down the shores
of Lake Michigan today and then
streaked back to Dayton and Cleve
land.
In the brief space of an hour Chi
cago saw its most spectacular aerial
exhibition, GOO planes in formation
flying down the lake front, and then
battle maneuvers by three "crack"
outfits of bombers, pursuit and at
tack ships.
To the Army it was a problem
of co-ordination, the safe and swift
movement of a great body of men
and equipment; but hundreds of
thousands of persons who swarmed
to the lake front and jammed the
roofs of buildings were looking for
thrills. They were not disappointed.
First there were more airplanes
than any of them had ever seen
before, flying in loose formation be
cause of strong winds and treacher
ous air currents, but impressive nev
ertheless. Groups of from 50 to 70
attack, bombardment, pursuit or ob
servation planes passed in quick
succession with press and photog
raphers' planes darting over and
under them.
