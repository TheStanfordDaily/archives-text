# RED CROSS LEADER SEES ORGANIZATION AS PEACE FACTOR
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 21 (/P).â€”A
Red Cross spreading the spirit of
peace was visioned by Judge Max
Huber, president of the international
committee of the Red Cross, on con
gratulating the American society at
a dinner tonight celebrating the 50th
anniversary of its organization.
President Hoover and a large
number of diplomats were among
the 800 guests at the anniversary
dinner. President Hoover also was
on the program.
Since the day of its origin, Huber
said, the Red Cross has meant "Re
lief to suffering friends and to suf
fering enemies alike."
Essentially non-political, the so
ciety cannot act directly on politi
cal issues, he pointed out, adding,
"but it can and it must develop that
spirit which makes for peace."
The Swiss jurist gave some credit
to the International Red Cross for
providing the impetus from which
the American organization resulted,
but added" the idea appeared simul
taneously on both continents with
Clara Barton as its chief American
proponent.
