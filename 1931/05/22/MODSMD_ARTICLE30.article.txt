# MISREPRESENTING THE FACTS
## 
### 
Because ;i college editor desired to plav the martyr,
and a city newspaper was negligent', Stanford I Diversity
lias once more been unjustly placed in an unfavorable
I i 111.
On Wednesday of this week Stanford readers of The
San Francisco News were amazed to tind on the front page
a story declaring that (iunnar Norberg, editor of ('.allege
Forum, had been expelled from the I niversitv for daring
to put out the magazine off-campus after Acting President
Swain had vetoed his plan to publish it on the campus.
Investigation bv The JJ.ui.v revealed the following
facts:

1. Nor berg had not been expelled, but had had his reg
istration cancelled at the end of winter quarter because he
had tailed to meet the customary scholarship requirements
set bv the I niversitv.

2. The News had received the "facts"' around which its
story was written from Norberg himself, and had pub
lished them without making an effort to obtain confirma
tion or denial from the Universitv.

The Daily was emphatic in its approval of College
Forum as a magazine, and heartily endorsed Norberg's
aims in publishing it, but it cannot condone Norberg's
action in misrepresenting the facts. As for The News, it
can hardly pride itself on printing a story for which there
was no basis in fact, even if it gave George P. West, its
editorial writer, and author of the famous "Success Hovs
al Stanford" article, a chance to write something else de
rogatory to the I niversitv.
