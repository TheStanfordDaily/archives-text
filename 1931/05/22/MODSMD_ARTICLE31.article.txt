# THE 						W.A.A. AGAIN
## 
### 
Next Tuesday the newly-installed executive hoard of
the Women's Athletic Association will meet. One of the
matters which will probably come before il for consid
eration is the proposed change of women's competitive ten
nis from spring quarter to fall quarter.
The argument for the change is that the present spring
quarter arrangement presents too intense a competitive
sport program. Competitive sports this quarter are tennis
and swimming. In the fall quarter, hockey alone is com
petitive, 'whili' in the winter quarter basketball is the only
competitive sport. In present set-up, no woman is allowed
to participate in two competitive sports simultaneously.
The contention thai the women are playing under a too
heavily loaded program has never been advanced by the
women themselves. They, who are themselves engaged in
these sport activities, have not complained that tennis and
swimming in the same quarter combine to make too strenu
ous a program. And there arises the question: Why is the
combination of tennis and swimming more difiicult for the
sportswomen to manage than the doubling up of tennis
and hockey?
Perhaps the new W.A.A. executive board can find some
specific and definite advantages which would result from
the proposed change, but the present arrangement seems
quite satisfactory.
