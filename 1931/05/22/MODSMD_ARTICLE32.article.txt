# TOWN AND COUNTRY

### 
When (i. K. Chesterton returned to Kngland from a
visit lo the I nitcd Slates lie seemed to have been impressed
mostly hy billboards, unplcasing metropolitan architecture,
and a few of the dry laws on the statute books. He is re
ported as declaring that American towns are eyesores to
the spectator with a European background and indicate
American barbarism.
It is unfortunate that such a noted personage should be
forced by the circumstances of his travel to make such ob
servations to an English society for the preservation of
rural beauty. It is true that even Americans are not pleased
by the informative scenery flanking American railways.
Hut one cannot draw generalizations of the sort expressed
by Chesterton without doing injustice to the quiet dignity
and beauty of any American towns north, south, east, and
west.
â€¢ None would dream of judging Knglish towns, English
men, and England by the architectural dumps common
near British railroads.- The Harvard C.rimsoii.

The biggest interest Oregon seems to have in (ieneral
Butler to date is whether he will say "hell" or "damn," not
whether be will reorganize the police force. The Orcr/on
