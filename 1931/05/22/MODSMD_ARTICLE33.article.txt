! THE CLASSICAL EDUCATION
(The Minnesota Daily)
Some time ago Dr. Hutchins an
nounced a drastic alteration in the
I curriculum and credit system of the
j University of Chicago. Since that
lime, other college and university
presidents, among thorn Dr. Highes
of Hamline University, have begun
to remodel their bulletins. Maga
zines and editorial pages have given
generous space to educators dis
'cussing these new plans and ideas.
Wide interest has focused upon the
"new education."
With the rise of this tendency to
war liberalism, well-expressed re
| actionary opinions are noteworthy.
In the May issue of The Atlantic
Monthly, Albert Jay Nock has writ
ten an article on "American Edu
cation." He deplores the "mass pro
duction" technique of our institu
tions of higher learning, and is con
vinced that a great proportion of
our students are unfit for more than
' high-school education.
Mr. Nock believes that entrance
requirements for colleges should be
"ability to read and write Latin and
Greek prose with ease and correct
ness; knowledge of arithmetic and
algebra up to quadratics; nothing
more." The student who has mas
tered this curriculum should then
take a course which covers the
1 whole range of Greek and Latin.
i literature, 'mathematics as far as
' differential calculus, formal logic,
the history of the English language
i "and nothing more." Particularly
displeasing to this scholar is voca
. tionalism in education, and his cur
riculum quite clearly reflects his
antipathy toward such a manifesta
| tion of "bogus democratic doctrine."
Many will agree that mass-pro
duction and standardization are low
ering the quality of our education.
But this rigid, classic course of study
is sharply at variance with the mod
ern tendency toward wide choice of
studies and "University Colleges."
Though any sincere and intelligent
opinion is valuable, that of Mr. Nock
must be considered merely as a dis
senting voice in the steady swing
away from classical education.
