well theres not much left to talk
about with the alpha delts moved
out and mostly off their lawn and
the kappas gone in for an extensive
sun burning process with a protec
tive tariff on admission too high to
stand unless you have an inside puil
fine stuff consider the art for arts
sale thats going to waste

well chappie came out with
another issue that was heralded
as the funniest in years but they
must have left out the funny
pages and as for razzing who
said anything about carrot tops
anyway thats a healthy vege
table old boy old boy for in
stance as compared with catnip
which is good only for certain
ailments not found in the united
slates of wisteria

well we have some new rules for
big game tickets too we must be
progressive at any cost the idea is
to make the thing seem worthwhile
not just another football game as it
has been considered for the last 25
[ years or so
just so the cost doesnt go any
higher let them regulate and see
who gives a damn only there should
be a distinction made between tights
and tightwads let the tightwads
squeal away so long as they pay for
their tickets but see that the other
half of the would be spectators who
are tight anyway be kept out of the
stadium and give their little white
i tags to the unhappy little new girls
on the corner

to make the thing seem worthwhile
not just another football game as it
has been considered for the last 25
[ years or so
just so the cost doesnt go any
higher let them regulate and see
who gives a damn only there should
be a distinction made between tights
and tightwads let the tightwads
squeal away so long as they pay for
their tickets but see that the other
half of the would be spectators who
are tight anyway be kept out of the
stadium and give their little white
i tags to the unhappy little new girls
on the corner

well the funniest thing has
happened who says true worth
isnt recognized a letter just ar
rived for the advice to the love
lorn column it has the pi phi
crest in the corner of the page
and the printable part goes
something like this

well theres not much left to talk
about with the alpha delts moved
out and mostly off their lawn and
the kappas gone in for an extensive
sun burning process with a protec
tive tariff on admission too high to
stand unless you have an inside puil
fine stuff consider the art for arts
sale thats going to waste

well chappie came out with
another issue that was heralded
as the funniest in years but they
must have left out the funny
pages and as for razzing who
said anything about carrot tops
anyway thats a healthy vege
table old boy old boy for in
stance as compared with catnip
which is good only for certain
ailments not found in the united
slates of wisteria

well we have some new rules for
big game tickets too we must be
progressive at any cost the idea is
