## NONE TOO SACCHARINE 
### 
j The Editor, Sir:
As a member of the Junior Opera
| Committee so witlily portrayed by
Mr. Burhell Gould in the current
issue of Chaparral, I should like to
extend my sympathies to Mr. Gould
on the condition of his digestion,
which has obviously suffered from
the consumption of an overdose of
grapes whose flavor was none too
I saccharine. Of course, Mr. Gould's
outburst was occasioned by a noble
[desire to protect the helpless Stan
j ford student body from having such
operas foisted upon it, and not, I
hope, because his own contribution
to the Junior Opera committee was
rejected in favor of "Proletariat
Plus." —Richard J. Friendlich.
