# TRAIN THE CITIZENRY

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I trust that all of your recent
contributors on the subject are
unanimous in condemning war. They
are divided, however, over "mili
tarism," as its opponents call it, or
"preparedness," as its supporters
call it. None of them, however, seem
to be attacking or defending any
specific thing.
I believe that the question has
two angles—the regular Army and
the unorganized militia, this latter
being the citizenry at large. I do
not support a large regular army.
It is expensive to maintain and it
creates a class of professional sol
diers, to whom, if to anyone, mili
tarism might be charged. The regu
lar Army should be as small as
possible.
However, the citizenry at large
should be better prepared than
they are. The colossal ignorance of
the average man concerning mili
tary affairs was well shown by the
last war.
When a nation is at war is the
worst possible time for training
camps. It is as though one set about
training the fire department after
the fire had started burning. It is
for this reason that I support mili
tary training in colleges. There those
presumably the most intelligent of
their generation are trained in the
essentials of wax', and are prepared
for command. A body of men is
graduated which is almost as effec
tive in time of crisis as a similar
number of professional soldiers
would be, yet is not a constant drain
on the government. When our citi
zenry at large is trained in the es
sentials of war, we shall not need a
large standing army to protect us
until, in the event of war, the citi
zenry can be trained. Furthermore,
the advantages in civilian life of the
ability to shoot, ride a horse, or
command men, are evident.
Yours sincerely,
Richard Bchrens Eaton
