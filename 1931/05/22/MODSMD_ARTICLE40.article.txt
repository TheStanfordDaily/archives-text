THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF RIME
—By Henry Lanz. Stanford Uni
versity Press. 19.11.
Exploring a new field, which con
siders rime to be one type of mel
ody, Dr. Lanz has for the founda
tion of his essay, the theory that all
sound is music. As a phrase of music
has a definite but somewhat in
tangible ending, so lines of poetry
repeat sounds to satisfy the neces
sity of balance.
Dr. Lanz discusses the origin of
rime; its history as considered by
Aristotle, Dante, Goethe, Lanier,
Milton, Edgar Guest; the present
deeply interesting controversy of
free verse. He presents the values
and limitations of rime as others
judge them, and believes its greatest
value to be its association with
melody; its great power, historical
and cultural.
Written in a clear, easily under
stood style, Dr. Lanz's book, supple
mented by lectures in a course soon
to be given at Stanford in the theory
of rime, will open a fascinating new
study for those particularly inter
ested in poetry and music. —J.N.
