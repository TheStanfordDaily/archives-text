# BULL SESSION
## FIGHTING OVER WORLD PEACE 
### 
' A recent meeting in the interests
of world peace held in New York
ended with the chairman calling
speakers various things—with the
audience hissing the chairman —and
finally a total breakup and disor
ganization of the meeting when the
chairman turned on the crowd and
stalked out of the hall.
Here was a group of distinguished
men coming together in the inter
ests of a great, elevated, advanced,
and worthy cause. Yet the chairman
wou'd not tolerate difference of
opinion from the floor, and the floor
refused to stand by the chairman.
It is such things as this that make
people laugh at idealists. Here we
have world peace advocates who are
always prone to brand as narrow
minded anyone that does not favor
their plans—whatever they happen
to be. Yet in their own group they
lack the broadness of vision to toler
ate difference of opinion among in
dividuals of their own group who
are obviously working for the same
goal.
The fight started when a New
York liberal wished the body to
pass a motion condemning army air
stunts in New York City. The
chairman refused to put the motion
to a vote. Personally, I see no harm

in having army planes exercise over
the big city. If, however, some
peace-loving soul wishes to present
| a motion disapproving of the planes
flying in the Army games, it is
[highly indicative of anything but a
proper peace-loving attitude for the
j chairman to refuse to put the mo-
I tion.
Fuel was added to the flame when
! somebody shouted approval of Rus- 1
i sia, which cry was countered by the
! chair with the charge that Russia
I was a "nation of murderers." For a
1 person heading a group seeking
j world peace, it might seem that this
j was not the correct thing to state.
There is always a strong tempta
i tion for an idealist to brand his op- |
j position by various titles indicating
j conservatism and the general re
! sistance to change. The man who 1
•has seen the light—who has sin- j
! cerely grabbed his cross for the
j disinterested uplift of mankind — |
: cannot bear opposition. The true ,
I leader to the new light, however, j
| will have to show not less but more j
I broad-mindedness than his oppon- ,
S ents if he is to succeed.

' A recent meeting in the interests
of world peace held in New York
ended with the chairman calling
speakers various things—with the
audience hissing the chairman —and
finally a total breakup and disor
ganization of the meeting when the
chairman turned on the crowd and
stalked out of the hall.
Here was a group of distinguished
men coming together in the inter
ests of a great, elevated, advanced,
and worthy cause. Yet the chairman
wou'd not tolerate difference of
opinion from the floor, and the floor
refused to stand by the chairman.
It is such things as this that make
people laugh at idealists. Here we
have world peace advocates who are
always prone to brand as narrow
minded anyone that does not favor
their plans—whatever they happen
to be. Yet in their own group they
lack the broadness of vision to toler
ate difference of opinion among in
dividuals of their own group who
are obviously working for the same
goal.
The fight started when a New
York liberal wished the body to
pass a motion condemning army air
stunts in New York City. The
chairman refused to put the motion
to a vote. Personally, I see no harm

in having army planes exercise over
the big city. If, however, some
peace-loving soul wishes to present
| a motion disapproving of the planes
flying in the Army games, it is
[highly indicative of anything but a
proper peace-loving attitude for the
j chairman to refuse to put the mo-
I tion.
Fuel was added to the flame when
! somebody shouted approval of Rus- 1
i sia, which cry was countered by the
! chair with the charge that Russia
I was a "nation of murderers." For a
1 person heading a group seeking
j world peace, it might seem that this
j was not the correct thing to state.
There is always a strong tempta
i tion for an idealist to brand his op- |
j position by various titles indicating
j conservatism and the general re
! sistance to change. The man who 1
•has seen the light—who has sin- j
! cerely grabbed his cross for the
j disinterested uplift of mankind — |
: cannot bear opposition. The true ,
I leader to the new light, however, j
| will have to show not less but more j
I broad-mindedness than his oppon- ,
S ents if he is to succeed.
