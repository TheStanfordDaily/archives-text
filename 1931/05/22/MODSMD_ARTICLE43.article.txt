It is generally known here
abouts that Dink Templeton is
leading his track team into the
East to participate in the 1.C.4-A.
at Philadelphia next Friday and
Saturday, but just what his 17
athletes will encounter there is
still something of a mystery to
the average track-minded Farm
lad.
You could pass it off as just an
other Stanford-Troy duel if it were
not Ihat some quick-thinking soul
would point out the obvious fallacy:
that track teams do not make a
practice of journeying across the
continent for the sole purpose of de
riding a supremacy that has already
horn thrice decided.
It is only true that Stanford
and Southern California will
meet again. How anyone could
call this a duel is difficult to
see, since paper gives the Tro
jans a clean-cut victory. The
Indians are sure of second, and
Pennsylvania a third. The re
maining Eastern institutions will
bailie it out for what glory re
mains.
The Quakers rate as Ihe best in
the East, first because of their Bar
ney fJerlinger, decathlon champion

.Mid one* of Iho few <>f this year's
Eastern stars whose name has pene
trated to the Pacific Slope. Ber
linger's best bet will be in the shot
put, where he has a mark of 48 feet
fi inches to his credit. His discus
ab'lity will avail him little, though
he can toss the platter past the 140-
foot mark. Last week against Cor
nell, Berlinger threw the javelin
193 feet (5 inches. And lie has pole
vaulled better than 13 feet (i inches!

Hill McKniff and Carl Coan
finished close together in a mile
run for Penn in the Cornell
meet last week, the former win
ning in 4:17.(5. That is McKniff's
best mark, while Coan has a
4:115.6 mile to his credit. Penn's
remaining stars are: Steel, a 48.;»
quarter-miler; Newkirk, who
jumped 6 feet .1 .inches last
week; Boyle, who runs a 9.8
century besides broad-jumping
beyond the 24-foot mark; Fred
Steiner, who has come within a
few scant inches of 150 feet in
the discus; and Bill Carr, a
promising broad- and high
jumper who until recently con
fined his activities to the 440.
Scanning the sports pages of the
New York Times has failed to bring
to light any startling performances
by Eastern two-milers. Yet the gen
eral opinion on the 1 coast is that
taking a two-miler back East is a
wasted effort. The time of 9:30 may
look weak to a few middlewest stars,
but we can't see just why everyone
seems afraid of Eastern eight-lap
men.

Michigan, the only middlewest in
stitution to enter a team in the
Philadelphia classic, will be on hand
with its famous hundred-yard col
ored star, Eddie Tolan. Tolan hasn't
been going so well this year, and
might find himself third to Frankie
WykofT and Hec Dyer at the tape
next week. Last year Tolan finished
between these two in the century,
and second to Dyer in the furlong.
