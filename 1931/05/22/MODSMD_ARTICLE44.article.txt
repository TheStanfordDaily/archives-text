# Sequoia Downs Capitan in Mural Ball Tilt
## HALL TEAM LEADS CLUB THROUGHOUT GAME TO WIN 6-4 Breakers, Phi Sig Game For Today Postponed; Play Next Week 
### Francis Hamilton 
El Capitan's bid for intramural
baseball supremacy was repulsed by
Sequoia yesterday when the latter
team won from the club men 6 to 4
on the varsity diamond. A first
inning drive which netted Sequoia
five hits and four runs was re
sponsible for the Capitan defeat.
El Capitan made a good start
when Shippy, second man up for
the club, hit a home run. That ended
the losers' scoring until the third
inning when two hits and a walk
combined to give them two more
runs. Sequoia added two more runs
to its first-inning total and was
blanked thereafter by Stump, pitch
ing for El Capitan.
Capitan Scores
With the "score G to 3 against
Capitan in its half of the seventh
inning, Shippy drew a walk, stole
second and third, and came home
when Rode bunted to Mack. Another
hit put the tieing runs on base but
there the Capitan attack faltered
and Mack disposed of the side with
two strike-outs. Baker caught for
Sequoia. Stump and Kehke were
the El Capitan battery.
The Breakers-Phi Sigma Kappa
meeting for the championship of
Leagues I and 11, scheduled for to
day has been postponed until next
week. Sequoia will meet El Tigru
sometime next week in the race for
the title.
