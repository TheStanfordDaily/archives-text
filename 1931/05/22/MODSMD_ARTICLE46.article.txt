### MICHAEL CROFOOT 
Editor's Note: Pole van Hers and hurdlers are taken lip in this article,
which is the fourth of a series dealing with the great track .stars developed
by Dink Tcmpleton.

According to present-day stand
ards, there have been only two In
dian pole • vaulters during the last
ten years who have gone high
enough to be called good. They are
Ward Edmonds (13'10") and Burt
DeGroot (13'6").
Like Podge Smith, Edmonds made
a sensational improvement under
the coaching of Templeton, not only
as a pole vaulter but as a hurdler.
Twice he came within an ace of set
ting a new world's record in the
cault at 14.2". The first time was in
the 1929 U.S.C. meet when he tied
Lee Barnes; the second was at the
1929 conference meet. Opposing the
Trojans' Lee Barnes, Yale's Sabin
Carr, Pittsburgh's Vic Pickard in the
IC4A's, he did his share toward
bringing Stanford its 1928 and 1929
championships. DeGroot is a shin
ing example of what perseverance
and coaching can do for a man. He
made his 13'6" vault against Califor
nia this year.

Both quality and quantity show
up when one looks back over the
long line of great Stanford hui'dlers.
There is Bob Williams, fourth in the
1921 IC4A's—Lane Falk, 1923 cap
tain, who ran the highs in 15.1 and
the lows in 23.9 —Jess Wells, 1921
captain and third-place winner in
the IC4A lows—Swede Leistner,
point-winner for two years in the

] IC4A's, coast champion, and maker
| of 14.(5 in the highs and 24 fiat in
the lows during the seasons of '24
' and '25.
There is Clarence West (14.9 and
24 fiat), who took 15 points in the
| 192G and '27 intercollegiates—Pioss
Nichols (14.6), 1929 captain and IS2B
IC4A champion in the highs—Ward
: Edmonds (15 flat and 23.8),
Last and certainly not least there
; is Podge Smith, captain of the cur
rent varsity. Times: 23.5 and 14.9.
Smith has placed in both hurdle
races in the last two intercollegiates
and hopes to win one this spring.
His 23.5 clocking against California
this year set up not only a Big Meet
! but a school record.

Smith has placed in both hurdle
races in the last two intercollegiates
and hopes to win one this spring.
His 23.5 clocking against California
this year set up not only a Big Meet

According to present-day stand
ards, there have been only two In
dian pole • vaulters during the last
ten years who have gone high
enough to be called good. They are
Ward Edmonds (13'10") and Burt
DeGroot (13'6").
Like Podge Smith, Edmonds made
a sensational improvement under
the coaching of Templeton, not only
as a pole vaulter but as a hurdler.
Twice he came within an ace of set
ting a new world's record in the
cault at 14.2". The first time was in
the 1929 U.S.C. meet when he tied
Lee Barnes; the second was at the
1929 conference meet. Opposing the
Trojans' Lee Barnes, Yale's Sabin
Carr, Pittsburgh's Vic Pickard in the
IC4A's, he did his share toward
bringing Stanford its 1928 and 1929
championships. DeGroot is a shin
ing example of what perseverance
and coaching can do for a man. He
made his 13'6" vault against Califor
nia this year.

Both quality and quantity show
up when one looks back over the
long line of great Stanford hui'dlers.

1921 IC4A's—Lane Falk, 1923 cap
