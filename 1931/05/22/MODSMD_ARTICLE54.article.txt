### 
GENEVA, May 21. (/P)—-Having j
sketched an outline of procedure for 1
constructing a program of general j
European, economic relief, the Pan- I
European commission adjourned to- j
night to meet again on September 3. i
The outline, as adopted with nu- ;
merous reservations, assigns vari- ;
ous elements in the economic situn- ;
t ion—such as tariffs, credits, unem- I
ployment, aniL customs preference j
for cereals—to special committees j
which were charged to concentrate i
study on them immediately.
It creates a co-ordinating commit
tee which meets in Geneva July G i
to receive committee proposals and
whip them into a harmonious gen- |
oral scheme of relief and rehabilita- I
tion. The results will be reported at
the September plenary session for >
action.
The final sitting of the commis- i
sion was the occasion for the sign- i
ing by representatives of 13 states i
of a convention setting up an in- !
ternational agricultural mortgage j
credit company which was described
as "the first child" of the commis
sion's labors. Three other signatures
were promised.
Before adjournment, Maxim Lit
vinoff, commissar of foreign affairs
of Soviet Russia, briefly reiterated
the Russian proposals for a general i
part of economic non-aggression, \
urging its immediate acceptance of
the projected protocol.
