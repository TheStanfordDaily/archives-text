# RUSHING RULES FOR U.S.C. MEN BANNED
## 
### 
Rushing rules at the University of
| Southern California have been
| abolished by the Interfraternity
! Council there after a lengthy study
jof rushing at other universities.
I Paul Zander, president of the coun-
I cil, explained that the complicated
! nature of the rules made them un
-1 wieldy.
New rules provide for rushing any
i time after the student is registered
j in the university, and the only re
j striction placed on fraternities is
that an 18-week period must elapse
1 after a pledge is broken before the
| student can be pledged by another
| fraternity.
