# TICKET REGULATIONS FURTHER EXPLAINED
## 
### 
The story in yesterday's Daily
concerning the new regulations re
garding tickets for the 1031 Big
j Game erroneously stated that of the
two additional tickets "only one may
be used by a member of the appli
cant's immediate family."
This regulation should read, "at
; least one of the two extra tickets
must be used by a member of the
applicant's immediate family."
About fifty students filed applica
tions for tickets yesterday. Blanks
may be filled out and turned in to
the Board of Athletic Control eveiy
I week day between !) and 5 o'clock.
