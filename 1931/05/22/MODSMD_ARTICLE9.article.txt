# ROW FIRE LAID TO BAD WIRING
## Electrical Short Circuit Cause Of Blaze 
### 
Short circuiting of electric wiring
running along the third floor ceil
ing was the probable cause of the
latest fire on the campus which
broke out in the Alpha Delta Phi
house Wednesday noon, causing
damages estimated at between two
and three thousand dollars.
Members stated yesterday that
both the ceiling of the third floor
and the roof of the house were in
good condition, and that no other
cause of the fire could be advanced.
Damage was limited mostly to wa
ter and breakage, the fire being
confined to the rafters of the house.
Brothers Move Out
Being forced to move out until
the damages can be repaired, mem
bers of the house will live at other
fraternities, besides at the homes of
Ben Eastman and other members in
the surrounding district.
Personal belongings such as books,
watches, room equipment, and va
rious pieces of wearing apparel have
been reported missing from the
avalanche of effects that came burst
ing through the windows as the men
tried to save their personal property
from the ravages of the fire.
Damage by Fighters
About a dozen windows were
broken in different parts of the
house, some after the real danger of
the fire was passed. Much tossing
of suitcases and wastebaskets full of
all sorts of room equipment resulted
in the major portion of the break
age. Most of the downstairs furni
ture was effectively removed to the
lawn and suffered no damage.

This is the first real Row fire the
campus has seen since the Kappa
Kappa Gamma house roof ignited
in September, 1927.
