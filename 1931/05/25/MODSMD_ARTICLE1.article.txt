# STANFORD NET TEAM MAY GO TO AUSTRALIA
## $1,100 Is Appropriated By B.A.C. To Complete New Heating Plant HEINECKE JOINS STAFF Philadelphia Trip Planned As Alternative 
### 
Possibility that Stanford will send
a four-man tennis team to Austra
lia for an exhibition tour next
month was seen in the action of the
Board of Athletic Control yester
day. The board gave its approval to
proposed plans for such a tour.
No American collegiate team has
made an appearance in Australia
since a Stanford team visited there
in 1924, and a group of Australians
ire seeking to sponsor another such
tour this year. Details have not
been arranged, however, and fur
ther plans for the trip cannot be
made until Harry Maloney, director
)f minor sports, returns from the
[.C.4-A. championships at Philadel
phia.
Finance Question
There is some question that the
Australian group will be able to ar
range for the financing of the tour,
nit should they be successful, the
;rip will undoubtedly be made.
Meanwhile the board made ar
rangements to send a two-man net
I cam to the Intercollegiates at the
Merrion Cricket Club, Philadelphia,
next month in the event that the
Australian tour is not made.
Obstacles Removed
Removing the last obstacle in the
way of installing heating equipment
in the Pavilion, the board appropri
ated $1,100 to add to similar sums
:ilready advanced by the A.S.S.U.
ind the administration.
Walter Heinecke, former all-coast
â€¢enter and one of the best pivot men
Pop Warner has turned out, was
udded to the coaching staff of the
University, being made an assistant
to Jimmy Bradshaw, freshman grid
coach.
A. R. Taylor was also added to
the coaching staff, being given a
'caching fellowship.
