# MEXICANS FREE TWO STANFORD BOTANISTS
## 
### 
The campus botanists, Professor
Ira Wiggins and James McMurphy,
recently detained by the Mexican
, government while on a botanical
expedition in Lower California, are
now at liberty to proceed north,
according to word that has just been
received.
The difficulty arose pver the fail
ure of the scientists to register prop
erly their car before entering the
most southerly of the two peninsular
states. Their liberty was temporar
ily forfeited. Local authorities, aided
by the American Consul at Mexico
City, effected a settlement on the
matter.
