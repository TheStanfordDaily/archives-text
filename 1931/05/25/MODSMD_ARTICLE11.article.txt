# GERMANY SEEN DISCONTENTED WITH TREATIES
## Moral Help From America Expected in Reduction Of Armaments 
### 
PARIS, May 24. (/P) —The most
ardent advocates of disarmament, it
is learned, are expecting no more
than an agreement to refrain from
increasing land and air armaments
to result from next year's gathering.
It is believed here that Germany
will not be satisfied with sucli a
solution because she has always
wanted what she calls a leveling of
armaments, meaning reduction of
those of the former allies to some
thing approaching Germany's
strength or else a right to increase
her arms to a point approximating
those of France, Poland, Czecho
slovakia and Rumania.
Postponement Sought
One or two extreme Nationalist
organs like La Liberte have started
a campaign for postponement on
the grounds that France runs a risk
of having the 1931 meeting result in
increased armaments for Germany
while those of France are stabilized.
Moral help from the American
government and the American peo
ple in pushing forward reduction of
armaments is generally expected in
international circles in Paris.
American Help
The opinion is being expressed
that American encouragement will
be needed if any serious hopes are
entertained as to the success of the
general disarmament conference at
Geneva next February.
Since it has been a tradition for
American Ambassadors in France to
make important political pronounce
ments on Memorial Day, there is
considerable speculation as to
whether Walter E. Edge will touch
on the world's desire for disarma
ment during his speech next Satur
day at Eureanes Cemetery.
