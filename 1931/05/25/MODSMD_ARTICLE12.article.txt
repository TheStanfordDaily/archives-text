# MELLON INSTITUTES BORROWING PLANS TO MEET DEFICIT

### 
WASHINGTON, May 24. (IP) —A
borrowing program to meet a deficit
of $800,000,000 or more this year, and
another—unestimated — next year,
stood in sharp relief today against
criticism heaped upon the nation's
revenue system by treasury heads.

Secretary Mellon called for revi
sion of the tax system last night. He
thus added his weight to that of
Undersecretary Mills, who recently
termed insistence upon a balanced
budget "the one means I know of
compelling a government to live
within its income and of making the
people realize if they desire to ex
pand the services of the government
they must inevitably look to in
creased contributions in the form of
taxes."
Mellon reaffirmed the statement
of other officials that borrowing
would be resorted to in meeting the
deficit.
To meet the situation, the Treas
ury has issued more than $2,600,000
in securities. The Treasury has an
aggregate of $3,350,000,000 in short
term paper outstanding.
