assistant director to King Vidor for
i two years.
As a student here Morgan was a
. prominent member of Ram's Head

I and Sword and Sandals, honorary

! in those days and il was customary
! to hire a coach for cach production.
' Dick Morgan frequently acted in the
I capacity of coach and his ability was
widely recognized. "He was always
putting on some show," Professor
i Lee Emerson Bassett of the Depart -
| ment of Public Speaking recalls.
Soon after he came to Stanford
| Morgan was cast in a small part in
I the dramatization of "The Tale of
l Two Cities." His talent was noticed
I at once. He starred on the campus
j stage from this time.
Played Feminine Roles
: He was the leading belle in Ram's
I Head's comic show, "Routing Raz
matez," produced in 191 G. An old

simply radiated from him."

dancing. A contemporary of his at
that time vividly remembers Mor
gan's spritely interpretation of a
senorita's dance. It was considered
the best piece of work of its kind

stage.
Dr. Margery Bailey, assistant pro
