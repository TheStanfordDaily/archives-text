# NIPPON ROYALTY VISITS ROBLE IN TOUR OF CAMPUS
## 
### 
POLITICAL SCIENCE, with
its emphasis on republican
ism and democracy, was thrown
into the discard Friday, when
poli sci disciples equalled the
zeal of the more emotional citi
zenry in hastening to rubber
neck at the Prince and Princess
of Japan.
The Prince Nobuhito Taka
nialsu, brother lo the Emperor
of Japan, and his bride, Prin
cess Kikuku, were luncheon
guests at the presidential man
sion on Lagunita Knoll, after
wards escorted on a tour of the
campus before continuing to
San Francisco.
The Princess, who speaks
perfect English, took special in
terest in Roblc, and gathered
the impression that it embodies
the gentler feminine arts—this
from a glimpse into the sewing
room, where the cut-out parts
of a pink crepe formal were
spread out, a hopeless puzzle
to its would-be creator. The
Prince confessed himself im
pressed by lioble kitchen.
