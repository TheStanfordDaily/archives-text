### 
Judge Jackson H. Ralston, a well
known authority on international
law, will speak on "Venezuela" at
the regular Tuesday evening lecture
tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock in
the Little Theater.
Judge Ralston has been interested
in Venezuela for some years. In
1903 the United States Government
named him as umpire for the Italian
claims against Venezuela before the
mixed tribunal at Caracas. He ed
ited the proceedings of all the mixed
commissions at Caracas in a volume
entitled "Venezuelan Arbitrations of
1903." He has also edited a report
of the French - Venezuelan Mixed
Claims Commission of 1910.

Among other positions he has held
in international relations are coun
sel in Washington for Felipe Agon
cillo, representing the Filipino re
public, before the war broke out in
1899. He was also the American
agent and of counsel in the case of
the Pious Fund of the Californias
against Mexico, the first dispute
submitted to the permanent court of
arbitration at The Hague under the
Hague Peace Convention of 1899.

Although retired from active legal
practice, Judge Ralston, who resides
in Palo Alto, delivers a course on
international arbitral procedure in
the Department of Political Science
every fall quarter. He is the author
of a number of works on interna
tional tribunals and on arbitration.
