# ALPHA DELT FIRE POLICY DEMANDS ONE PER DECADE
## 
### 
THERE was a deadly systcm
atic , something about the
Alpha I)elt fire last week. Ap
parently the boys art* commit
ted to a policy of exactly peri
odic attempts at getting a new
stronghold.
The fire last week broke out
at 12:15 o'clock. Last Wednes
day was May 20, 1931. On May
20, 1921, at 11:45 o'clock, the
Alpha l)clt house was afire, the
entire campus gathered around
to see the fun, windows and
doors were broken in abun
dance, and the entire stock of
Alpha Dclt living parapher
nalia was piled in picturesque
disarray on the front lawn.
A story in the Quad of that
year indicates that the boys
were no more successful then
than they were last week, gain
ing similarly only a new roof
and a few windows. It is sug
gested that the Alpha I)elts put
a note on their calendar for
1 Kll. May 20, instructing the
brothers-to-be to start that fire
in three or four different places,
and to be more careful about
waiting a long enough time be
fore notifying the fire depart
ment.
