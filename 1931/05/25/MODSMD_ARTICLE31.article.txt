# AGAIN-THE A.S.S.U. CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
Another Split scum in that leaky vessel, the A.S.S.U.
constitution, was brought to student attention last week
when seven members of the varsilv water polo team were
given Block "S" awards for "having won the National
Junior A.A.I . championship."
Winning the National Junior A.A.I\ championship in
litis particular case consisted of defeating Sequoia In ion
High School and the Olympic Club. Without casting anv
aspersions on the ability of the water polo team, one can
observe that gaining block letters in this instance was a
relatively simple matter. Taking into consideration the
system of awards in use at Stanford, and the fact that
water polo is a minor sport, block letters seem a reward
hardly commensurate with the feat.
As usual, the fault lies with the A.S.S.I . constitution,
which provides, in a section under special awards, that
block letters be given "to anv man competing on a team
which wins a national championship." II is fairly obvious
that the constitution-builders didn't have the National Jun
ior A.A.r. water polo title in mind when drawing up that
clause. It is also fairly obvious that the constitution should
be amended to read, "any man competing on a team which
wins a national SENIOR or national INTEKCOLLEOIATE
championship be awarded a Hloek S."
