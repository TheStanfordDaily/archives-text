# INDEPENDENT STUDY
## 
### 
During llio remaining days of this quarter, s 1 iiclents
who will be in Hie upper division in I lie summer or fall
quarters may arrange to take work under Hie independent
study plan. Any upper division student, with averages of
H or better, may register under this plan, which makes
possible individual work by the student under the direc
tion of a faculty adviser in his major department.
The amount of work planned for independent study
may vary, with a large or small amount of work to be
taken in courses. In any case, the program for the stu
dent's remaining quarters of undergraduate work is
planned as a whole. All of the work may be done inde
pendently, or only a small portion of it.
This quarter there are 13 students working oil the in
dependent study plan. Three of them will be graduated at
the end of the quarter. Thirty-six students have been grad
uated under the plan since its inception six years ago.
Twenty of these were graduated with honors.

The 1 opportunities offered to students who work under
the plan are exceptional. Independent students are re
lieved from class attendance, and may arrange their work
as they please, bound to 110 fixed schedule. They work on
projects which interest them. The basic virtue of'the plan
is that it enables students who are interested in a particular
subject or phase of a subject to concentrate on that, and be
freed from the burdens of class work. Those students who
are working independently are enthusiastic about the plan.

One student, a history major, selected as his field of
study (lie industrial revolution and its effect on all phases
of the national life of England. He did !J(> units of work
on this subject. Another student plans to complete (VI units
in the study of American trade and business in Latin
America. Other students on the plan are majoring in psy
chology, political science, English, and history.

As often as he wishes, a student on the independent
study plan may consult the adviser in his major depart
ment to whom he has been assigned. A comprehensive,
oral examination is given at the close of the period of
study, which determines the grade for the whole period.
Frequently this examination is supplemented by written
reports during the course <>f the work.
Students who are interested in the independent study
plan have been invited by Professor Kdgar E. Kobinson,
chairman of the independent study plan commit lee, to dis
cuss their programs with him, at 172 Administration build
ing, before the end of this quartet*.
The fraternity systen\ is always under criticism, which
it does not attempt to meet. Its problems are vital ones,
which it has so far refused lo face by playing the ostrich,
and <lucking its head to criticism, while its faults remain
glaringlv evident.- Orftfoit Fnirrahl Freshman Fililion
