("Daily Princetonian")
The "inside dope" on the athletic
policies of Yale, Harvard, and
Princeton is given by John R. Tunis
in an article, "Pooh-bahs of Sport,"
which appears in the May issue of
The Forum. A Pooh-bah, incident
ally, is an athletic director. "Col
lege athletics," saiys Mr. Tunis, "are
amateur athletics, they are suppo
sedly the finest example we have of
amateur sportsmanship, and they
are—or should be —an inspiration to
everyone who loves games for their
own sake." On the basis of this
correct principle, he finds much to
criticize in the present status of in
tercollegiate sport? principally the
extent of the control exercised by
the athletic directors, the three gen
tlemen in office at Yale, Harvard,
and Princeton serving as cases in
point.
These athletic directors, we are
told, are intelligent sportsmen whose
feelings are in line with the best
conceptions of sportsmanship. Nev
ertheless, they have their "jobs" to
consider, and the result is a com
plicated underground diplomacy in
jockeying for schedules and gate
receipt slices, that is only paralleled
by governmental foreign offices.
Often, the actual attitudes and re
lationships of student bodies have
as little to do with intercollegiate
hostilities and "breaks" as "a certain
murder down in Sarajevo in 1!)14
had to do with the World War.' The
director feels that it is part of his
obligation to increase the prestige of
his university and the funds of hi:;
A.A. To this end, he abets the "em
phasis on winning," and the general
result is encouragement of that pro
fessionalizing of college athletics
which all unite in condemning.
Toward changing tins undesirable
condition Mr. Tunis urges the trans
fer of control to the students them
selves, leaving only a sort of "bur
sar", to handle routine details of
business. At first glance, this pro
posal appears excellent-- certainly,
the amateur should play how and
with whom he chooses. But further
consideration proves it utterly im
practical. In the first place, control
would necessarily bo delegated to a
small number of men. In loyalty
and in the desire for a creditable
record, they would be equally eager
to advance the finances and reputa
tion of their alma mater. At the
same time, to do this inoffensively
they would lack the ability, judg
ment, and tact that only experience
can give. The effect would hardly
be to lessen the distrust!"ulness and
sensitiveness already existent be
tween various institutions. And in
the long run, the tendency of the
curriculum-ridden student would be
to shift more and more of the re
sponsibilities of the athletic program
to his "bursar."
Finally, it is safe to assert that the
undergraduate bodies of most in
stitutions generally have confidence
in their athletic directors. Never
theless, Mr. Tunis' well-intentioned
reflections point out two failings
which are not beyond remedy. Ath
letic directors too frequently disre
gard the true student sentiment in
intercollegiate policies, and the stu
dents themselves are at fault in
failing to unite insistently in pre
senting their opinions and desires.

undergraduate bodies of most in
stitutions generally have confidence
in their athletic directors. Never
theless, Mr. Tunis' well-intentioned
reflections point out two failings
which are not beyond remedy. Ath
letic directors too frequently disre
gard the true student sentiment in
intercollegiate policies, and the stu
dents themselves are at fault in
failing to unite insistently in pre
senting their opinions and desires.
POOH—BAII
("Daily Princetonian")
The "inside dope" on the athletic
policies of Yale, Harvard, and
Princeton is given by John R. Tunis
in an article, "Pooh-bahs of Sport,"
which appears in the May issue of
The Forum. A Pooh-bah, incident
ally, is an athletic director. "Col
lege athletics," saiys Mr. Tunis, "are
amateur athletics, they are suppo
sedly the finest example we have of
amateur sportsmanship, and they
are—or should be —an inspiration to
everyone who loves games for their
own sake." On the basis of this
correct principle, he finds much to
criticize in the present status of in
tercollegiate sport? principally the
extent of the control exercised by
the athletic directors, the three gen
tlemen in office at Yale, Harvard,
and Princeton serving as cases in
point.
These athletic directors, we are
told, are intelligent sportsmen whose
feelings are in line with the best
conceptions of sportsmanship. Nev
ertheless, they have their "jobs" to
consider, and the result is a com
plicated underground diplomacy in
jockeying for schedules and gate
receipt slices, that is only paralleled
by governmental foreign offices.
Often, the actual attitudes and re
lationships of student bodies have
as little to do with intercollegiate
hostilities and "breaks" as "a certain
murder down in Sarajevo in 1!)14
had to do with the World War.' The
director feels that it is part of his
obligation to increase the prestige of
his university and the funds of hi:;
A.A. To this end, he abets the "em
phasis on winning," and the general
result is encouragement of that pro
fessionalizing of college athletics
which all unite in condemning.
Toward changing tins undesirable
condition Mr. Tunis urges the trans
fer of control to the students them
selves, leaving only a sort of "bur
sar", to handle routine details of
business. At first glance, this pro
posal appears excellent-- certainly,
the amateur should play how and
with whom he chooses. But further
consideration proves it utterly im
practical. In the first place, control
would necessarily bo delegated to a
small number of men. In loyalty
and in the desire for a creditable
record, they would be equally eager
to advance the finances and reputa
tion of their alma mater. At the
same time, to do this inoffensively
they would lack the ability, judg
ment, and tact that only experience
can give. The effect would hardly
be to lessen the distrust!"ulness and
sensitiveness already existent be
tween various institutions. And in
the long run, the tendency of the
curriculum-ridden student would be
to shift more and more of the re
sponsibilities of the athletic program
to his "bursar."
Finally, it is safe to assert that the
undergraduate bodies of most in
stitutions generally have confidence
in their athletic directors. Never
theless, Mr. Tunis' well-intentioned
reflections point out two failings
which are not beyond remedy. Ath
letic directors too frequently disre
