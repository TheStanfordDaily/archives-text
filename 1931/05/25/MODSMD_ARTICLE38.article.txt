The Editor, Sir:
1 should like to correct Ihe im
pression expressed recently in your 1
pages that the University has not '
protected Cedro Cottage from fire '
hazards. We have a two-inch main !
with three outlets and four long j
pieces of fire hose. Every year Mr. ;
Dugan inspects the premises and j
lakes great pains to make them safe. !
The real danger comes from the
fact that there are, to the north and j
west, large fields of uncut grass, j
Nothing short of a change in the!
climate can make such a situation j
wholly free from danger. I have
long regarded the fire department j
as the most efficient department in i
the University. I should like to take |
occasion to thank students and!
neighbors who came to our assist
ance the other day.
