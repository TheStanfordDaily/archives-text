# FORM PUBLIC OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
All the Campus Opinion letters so
far submitted agree that war is not
desirable. Messrs. Muller and Dou
dorff, however, take the well
known point of view, "We don't
want war, but " and then tell
how preparing for war makes for
peace.
War, contrary to general opinion,
really has a use in this worldâ€”the
settling of disputes. The only trou
ble with it is that it never settles
them, and is terribly expensive as
to costs in money, lives, general
welfare of those who survive, and
in retarded development of the
human race. Also, it is the strong
nation and not the right nation that
rules.
Provisions for peaceful settling of
disputes provide competitors for
war. At present the Arbitration
Court at The Hague, the Permanent
Court of International Justice (the
League Court to Hearst and the
D.A.R., but the World Court to the
more intelligent) and the League of
Nations provide means of settling
international difficulties without
war. Fifty-four nations of Ihe world
put their trust into them. Many
Lpague members have compulsory
arbitration treaties that put all dis
putes of which the nation is a mem
ber up to one of these agents.
Mr. Dickenson claims that the
League is a European group. This
is because America is out of it, and
because the most powerful nations
are located in Europe. It is hardly
possible that American participa
tion would stir up our immigrants to
strife in supporting their homelands
in disputes. In the World War, we
had no civil war because of dis
satisfied immigrants.
There are two main supporters
for war, chauvanism and militarism.
Chauvanism is excessive and dan
gerous patriotism that talks of "My
Country Right or Wrong." Flag
worship, hatred of other nations, and
belief in the "Divine right of Our
Countree' 1 are phases of chauvinism.
Militarism, or excessive armaments
and willingness to use them, is a
partner of chauvanism and tends to
make war easier. (Somebody once
said, "Which fight the most, dogs or
rabbits?") A display of arms by one
nation endangers the other's "Se
curity," and the race is on.
Our job is easily seen. Mr. Os
borne's "intelligent public opinion"
on the subject is the hope we have.
Opinion for support of the Courts
and the League, opinion against
chauvanism, and opinion against ex
cessive armaments should be
formed.
It is our job to form it.
