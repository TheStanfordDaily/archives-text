We note with alarm the multitude
of animals on the campus, and view
with horror the condition of the
Farm as a game preserve for quail,

to see lethargic animals covering
the grounds—for true nature is
"wild and hoary."

allowed to stalk the "game"; the
result would be thai our wild life
would be frightened enough so it
would he really wild, and a big field
