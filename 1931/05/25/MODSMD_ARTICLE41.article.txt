### NEWSREELS—A MISNOMER 
While, the paid customers are fil
ing into their seats, the management
usually presents several reels of
stuff—named newsreels. Now when
one hears the word, "newspaper,"
one usually thinks of news on paper;
when one hears the word, "news
reel, one should think of news on
reels of film. Unfortunately, only by
the wildest stretch of the imagina
tion could these things be held to
present news.
Before the films began to screech,
there was some excuse for failing
to present more than landscapes and
an occasional shot of some public
figure. One would have imagined
that after the movies- found their
voice, we would be treated to
snatches of speeches by great men,
or at least a few words from notori
ous gangsters and the like. None of
these hopes have been realized.
The producers of newsreels seem
to have assumed that their film
should present things similar to
those found in comedies, dramas, and
travelogues. As a result, the news
reels seem to have a set of stock
"shots" which with minor variations
are presented over and over again.
One can always be sure of seeing
some chorines in the daintiest little
costumes go through some rehearsals
before a cool, mustached male at
every opening of the New York sea
son; and if the musical comedy re
hearsals cannot furnish suitable dis
plays, there is always sure to be a
bathing beauty contest in full swing
at some resort. Of course it was
spectacular news the first years of
our attending movies to find out

; what went on in rehearsals and at
beauty parades; it has since lost its
news value to the great majority of
! the movie audience.
Sound films have given the news
reels new weapons, which have
| been turned to the worst possible
1 use, as was to be expected. Riveters
j highup somewhere are a consistent
1 source for newsreel material; and
I probably will remain so as long as
skyscrapers are being built. Booming
artillery is always impressive, and
I the low thunder from the explosions
j seems to register well in the sound
\ films; consequently any big gun that
| cannot "break into the films" is in
1 a small class by itself.
Not being raised with horses from
the time I knew that a stirrup was
' something to place the foot in, con
i tinual newsreels on derbies rapidly
lost their news value for me.
"They're off," and after a few times
around the track, one horse, bearing
some number under 15 as a rule, and
I with a bouncing, undernourished in
i dividual on and off the saddle,
| breaks the tape to win the race. The
crowds go mad.
Endless examples might be cited
Jto show that to call the newsreels
| by that name is to commit a sin of
j grave proportions. The educational
| value of the films for the "average
I citizen who has no time to read the
; newspaper is fast approaching nil
l (or zero). On the other hand if the
! funny papers, "Oddities in the
' News," and "Believe It or Not" can
; be honestly classified as news, per
j haps it is still permissible to name
: those things under discussion, news
i reels. _ • —Abe Mellinkoff.
