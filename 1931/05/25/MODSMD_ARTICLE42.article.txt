TARNISHED LADY—At the New !
Stanford Theatre.
The much-heralded Tallulah !
Bankhead has come back to Amer- !
, ica, and appears in her first "talkie," j
1 "The Tarnished Lady." Tallulah is 1
I very lovely and a strange mixture of |
Joan Crawford and Marlene Diet
rich, but what a painfully bad see- !
nario the movie czars have in-
I flicted on her!
Tarnished Lady is a very poor j
hash of all other movies dealing with ,
! the perennial trio of love, money, |
I and marriage. The cast does its very j
| best to hide this, but the effort, ;
| though noble, is unsuccessful.
I The acting, however, is very j
superior. Clive Brook in the only ,
sypmathetic role outdoes himself; i
I while Tallulah makes one forget that j
, she is cast as a rather unforgivably j
i weak character. —N.J.
DUDE RANCH—At the Varsity. I
| The sense of humor needed for '
I this picture is a rare one. Jack
J Oakie has an ingratiating smile on
his sweet, wholesome countenance
I most of the time, but his clowning
| is of the kindergarten variety. And
I that lovely infant, Mitzi Green, sim-
I pers through the foreground of half
j the scenes.
But if you don't take the picture
; seriously at all—you can see that it
has an unconscious humor. It is a
: beautiful burlesque on Western

| thrillers, and in a good-natured way
it is fairly diverting. At the very
j end, it has a big moment—with the
i suspense element very well handled.

1 BRASS ANKLE—By Dußose Iley
ward. Farrar and Rineliart. 1931.
$2. (At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Larry and Ruth loved and, idealis
! tically enough, married. In the
i course of time they had two chil—
! dren: the first a sweet little Eva,
1 the second a potential Topsy.
Ruth, announced the Mendelian
! dabbling physician with necessary
1 paternal air, was a brass ankle, the
I child a carry-over. Whereupon Ruth
relieved her nigger-hating hubby's
| embarrassment by having him mur
j der her and the sooted babe.
Dußose Heyward stayed away
! from preachment in Porgy, and sat-
I isfied himself with making a strong
| tale. '"Brass Ankle's" biological les
son may interest students of social
problems, but its whirlwind finale
seems artificial, as if the author, not
able to solve the mess, made murder
the easiest way out.
Having read this may we again
observe that the Pulitzer Prize Com
, miltee is to be congratulated for
their restraint in selecting a play
without boldface moral and with no
more melodramatic attachment than
a little house afire. —J.S.S.
