Just five days more of this stu
| pendous stufT, and then you'll have
| to stai't looking somewhere else ior
! your daily laugh—in a textbook,
maybe. At any rate, if you haven't
learned to giggle, at least in tolera
tion, by this time, there's no use
hoping for improvement. You're
doomed to a spotlessly« virtuous
existence as a high-salaried bank
I president, and we don't know any
thing about that species.
All things being equal, a lot
of us will be on our way into
(lie great, wide, wonderful world,
in a couple of weeks more. It s
been a grand vacation, but it al
lays ends sentimentally. Witness
the 16-cylindered athlete weep
ing by a hole in the Lasuen
I sidewalk, because he stumbled
there once when he was a frosh.
Ashes of roses!
-We've learned an awful lot cf
! things here, though, one in particu-
I lar about feminine dress on, around,
| and pertaining to campus. If a
| woman wears a big, drooping hat
i it's because she wants to be coy.
I day would be had by all. There
j might be a few cases for the hos
{ pital, but let the pacifists stay in
side. Let's talk it up, fellows! We 11
i turn loose a buffalo on the big day
1 and give a prize to the man who
j bags it.
