If she wears a big, drooping
dress, it's because nothing
smaller will go on, or else that
\ there is a modest co-ed.
The track fiends are well under
: steam on their way East now.
i There's a tricky new system of
I keeping the hurdlers, if any, in trim,
I on such a trip. The idea is to bound
| from one red plush seat, over the
j bald heads and women with howling
j infants, to the next r.p.s., without
, disturbing qny more than the baby's
i yells. Wayward porters and made
| up berths provide the proper men
| tal hazard and stumbling blocks for
! the last leap.
There's a thought—maybe we
should devote a whole colyum,
one of these days, to helpful
hints for summer travelers.
| There's no earthly use, of course,
! in staying in the states, when
huagihlutagis are calling from
the South Seas every day, now,
and free rootbeeer running in
Che streets of Amsterdam. On
, our way!
