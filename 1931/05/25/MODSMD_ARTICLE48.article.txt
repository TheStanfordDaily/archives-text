EASTWARD BOUND
It was no less than surprising,
(he number of fans who turned
out to see the team off Satur
day afternoon. Probably the rea
son is that the rally committee
didn't make any attempt to
round up the roughs for the
send-off. Another surprise, you
could hardly tell that those boys
were athletes, the way they
were decked out in the haber
dashery. Dink Templeton had
on a gray flannel suit, pansy
shoes, and a Panama hat. Little
did he resemble a chieftain hit
ting the trail with a band of
redskin warriors. A smooth lot
of Indians, we'd say.
Bobby Brown, just before the
ain pulled out, was awarded a very
ige box with a carnation on the
ip. It looked from the outside like
uthing short ol* an Austin.' Bob
ruggled with it for a time, and
len, with the aid of several around
im, managed to get it open. There
as exactly nothing but space hi
de, and the mob enjoyed a huge
ugh on Stanford's mi lei'. Bob took
ic carnation and put it in his but
mhole for luck. He'll need it
Jainst guys like McKniff and.Coan
Penn, Bullwinkle of C.C.N.Y., and
alstead of Troy.
Templeton didn't look particularly
'Ppy, despite the glad rags. We
id read in the newspapers that he
as going to lead bis men aboard
ie train, but instead, he was the
st man to get on. The team had
eked the second car behind the
lgine, and most of them were in
eir seats when along came the
ng, carrying a lot of luggage and
histling a sad tune from under that
inama. He chose the car next to
e last, and the team had to pile
it and follow him. Maybe Dink
as chuckling inside.
Among the boys who suffered
a lot of handshaking was Mr.
Alviu Adolph "Ike"' Hables,
who appeared especially joyful
o\er leaving the Farm. Maybe
he was tired of professors and
classrooms. But if you bad just
been elected captain of the 1032
team, you'd probably have a grin
on your face. too.
Congratulate Ihe new leader,
ales. Ike hasn't been coming in
.si in 440 races around here this
•ar, but only because the other
ree members of Dink's world
ampion mile relay team are a
ado faster. Ike ran 48.8 in that
12.6 mile. Last year, if you re
ember, 48.8 was good enough to
at Vie Williams of Troy. At least
did here in the California Inter
llegiates, and Ike was the man
10 turned the trick. Johnny Mor
ion was not running in that meet.

Bcn Eastman was there look
ing more like a student than an
athlete, what with those goggles
of his and civics instead of a
track suit. lie didn't seem to
know yet whether he was run
ning the half or the quarter at
Philadelphia. Maybe Dink
knows, but he isn't telling any
body. We have a suspicion that
'Jen will slick to the quarter,
licsiflcs the lirst 440 man who
crocked through in one lap event
after the East had read so much
about him, Eastman would hurt
Troy more in that race by shov
ing Williams back to a second
instead of a five-point first.
