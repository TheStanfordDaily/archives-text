### 
Acting President Robert E. Swain
last Friday officially blasted the
statement of Gunnar Norberg, edi
tor of "College Forum," to the effect
that he had been expelled from
Stanford University "for conduct
unbecoming a Stanford student" just
after publication of the first issue
of the magazine.

Said Dr. Swain, "I am reluctant to
| depart from the practice of this of
fice not to discuss publicly our re- I
j lations with individual students who j
j for any reason are dismissed from
I the University, but in this case the 1
misrepresentation is so flagrant that'
it may not be overlooked. This !
young man was dismissed from ;
Stanford University two months ago j
j for one reason only, that is, poor j
| scholarship. He had previously been
i on probation twice and once dis- j
j missed from the University owing !
|to scholarship deficiencies. Inas- |
i much as this is the second disquali
fication for scholarship it will be- |
come permanent. It is too bad to i
have to rob this young man of the !
publicity of martyrdom but this is >
not to be achieved by false state
i ments to the press."
