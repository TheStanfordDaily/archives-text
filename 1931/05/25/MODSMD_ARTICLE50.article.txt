Oval. Teams may enter until the
opening of the first event at 2
o'clock. Many of the living groups
have already stated their intentions
of competing.

years, is a strong favorite, although
Breakers has a good chance of car
rying off the trophy. Toro has sev
eral threats, among them Wright,
second best half-miler in school.
Each man on the team will, enter
all six events and his score goes to
the total for the group he repre
sents. However, individual records
will be kept, since there are five
medals to be awarded to high-point
men.
After the 120-yard low hurdles
and shot put on Tuesday and the
discus and half-mile Wednesday, the
hexathlon meet will be climaxed by
an eight-man mile relay Thursday
afternoon. Trials for this event will
be held tomorrow.
Only ineligibles are Block "S"
men and this year's frosh numeral
men. This should leave an interest
ing field of entries, although the best
records made in the last six or seven
years of the meet will hardly fall.
Intramural track is getting off to a
late start this year, due to the
crowded athletic schedule of the
spring quarter. Parker Reed, intra
mural student manager, says the
meet will probably not be held next
year.
