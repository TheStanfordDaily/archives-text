### Feg Murray, '16 
Saturday, May 16, saw two long
! standing records put on the spot.
! One was beaten, the other equalled,
a three-year-old thoroughbred race
' horse accomplishing the former, ?nd
j a twenty-year-old university sopho
' more the latter. Four legs are better
! than two, so Twenty Grand raced a
I mile and a quarto}* to win the 57th
1 Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs
in 2:01 4-5, to break Old Rosebud's
I record for the historic race by 1 2-5
| seconds.
And, on the same afternoon, a be
j spectacled tow-headed young Stan
j ford athlete, Ben Eastman, was tear
j ing around the cinder track of the
Olympic stadium in Los Angeles fast
enough to equal Ted Meredith's
world's record for the quarter-mile
of 47 2-5 seconds. Old Rosebud made
his record in 1914.. Ted Meredith
! set his mark two years later,

1 ter having beaten him in the Preak- |
ness a week previous. Ben Eastman, |
; too, had stiff competition, leading j
Vic Williams of U.S.C., the National j
A.A.U. champion, to the tape, as j
well as his teammate, Shove, who is l
1 nobody's slowpoke, either. But j
Twenty Grand won fifty grand for j
, his owner, Mrs. Payne Whitney,â€¢[
i while Eastman won a gold medal, j
i five points for his team, and a lot j
of glory for his coach, Dink Temple- j
ton. |
I saw Ted Meredith set the world's j
l quarter-mile record in the Harvard j
! stadium back in 1916. An hour af- !
j terwards he established a new IC4A
half-mile record with his 1:53. East- j
man, too, has run a 1:53 half, but I ]
doubt if he could match Meredith's j
iron man st unt, at least not this |
| year. As for Twenty Grand, who ran
i his. first half-mile in 47 2-5, he
should go on to added glory in 11 ie i
Belmont, the Dwyer, the Arlington j
Classic, the Travers, and other big I
i races.
