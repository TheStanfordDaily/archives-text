I
I As a coach of weight men, Dink
Templeton is without a peer.
Under his tutelage Glenn Hart
j ranft threw the discus 158'3", the
j shot 50*11 1 id", and won four IC4A
i championships; Biff Hoffman hurled
i the disk 153, the shot 49'8", and won
lone intercollegiate title; Eric Krenz
[ tossed the discus 167'5", the shot
51'7'", and won four IC4A crowns;
! Harlow Rothert (150 and 52'IVV)
| captured two IC4A championships.
There have been and are others,
but these four were outstanding. It
was their performances which re-
I suited in Dink's being chosen as
j weight coach of the 1928 Olympic
I team and which will probably get

j him the same position on the 1932
team. THey were a very important
factor three of the Cardinal
triumphs in IC4A meets.
Hartranft came first. He was a
mainstay of the 1922-4-5 track teams.
i During the first two of these years
he took 20 out of a possible 20
points in the Eastern invasion. In
1925, when the Indians did not go
back East, he broke even with
i Houser, that year's IC4A weight
I king. Only in the 1924 Olympics
i when he was not under Templeton's
tutelage, did he fail.
Clifford (Biff) Hoffman was the
next standard bearer. Five points of
j the Indians' 1926 IC4A total and

j nine of their 1927 points were due
i to his efforts.
| Then came that great duo, Rothert
and Krenz, of the 1928-9-30 squads,
famous so recently and to such an
extent that they need little intro
duction. Eric excelled in the discus.
He is the first coast athlete ever to
! take three consecutive IC4A titles
â€¢in one event. Out of 30 possible
points* in these three meets, he ac
i counted for 28. For a year he en
joyed the honor of being a world's
i record-holder. Rothert won as many
{ honors in the shot put. His 52'1 ! 4"
heave of the brass ball in the 1930
IC4A meet set a record that will
stand a long, long time.
