# CROWDS FLOCK TO NEW BUILDING AT HOSPITAL OPENING
## San Francisco Medical Men Compliment Institution After Inspection 
### Shannon Allen 
Approximately four thousand peo- I
pic were present last Friday to in- |
spect the building and equipment of ;
the new Palo Alto Hospital which
was opened for the first time on that
date.
Physicians, nurses, and hospital
officials from San Francisco and the I
East Bay who were among the
crowd who visited the new hospital
complimented highly the new insti
tution for the excellence of its
equipment, the completeness and
cdicieney of its surgery department,
and the easy accessibility of the site.
Suggests Hotel
The whole building is notable for
its lack of resemblance to the usual
grim blank whiteness, suggestive of
anaesthetics and pain, which char
acterizes the average hospital. In
its pleasant rooms with colored
hangings and equipment it suggests
a first-class up-to-date hotel or
apartment house rather than a hos
pital.
Each room is equipped with com
fortable chairs to make the bed-side
manner easier to assume for visi
tors, and the entertainment of the
patients is assured by the installa
tion of two plugs for radio head
phones beside each bed. These are
connected to two radios on the
ground floor, each tuned to a differ
ent station.
Loud Speakers in Halls
Each floor is equipped with a |
loud speaker in the hall by which j
doctors in different parts of the i
building may be called when needed J
elsewhere. All patients' rooms are
sound proofed and all are fitted up |
with the latest things conducive to j
the comfort and happiness of the j
sick.
The nursery created considerable |
interest among the crowd of visitors. ;
This is equipped with a large glass j
panel opening onto the hall through
which anxious parents may glance
at their offspring although they will
not be permitted to enter and com- '
municate dangerous germs to the j
babies.
Members of the "500"' who led the :
visitors through the building did an i
excellent job of guiding, and the
floral decorations provided by the
Palo Alto Garden Club added to the
friendly atmosphere of the opening
day.
