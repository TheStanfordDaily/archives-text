â€”An evolutionary tendency among
college men and women to grow
taller, broader-shouldered, narrow

made public at Harvard University.
The findings are based on meas
urements of three generations of
Harvard sons, including 2,000 pairs
of fathers and sons, and on three
generations of daughters of Welles

Colleges, numbering 501 mothers
