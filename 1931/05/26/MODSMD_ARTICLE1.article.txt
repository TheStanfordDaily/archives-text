# [illegible] CRITICIZE [illegible] ESTIMATE [illegible] RIDICULOUS
## [illegible] of Temperance Joins Anti-Saloon League to Protest Figures [illegible] PUBLICITY FLAYED Wet Figures Branded As Wild Speculation 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 25 (/P).—
wo dry organizations today took
uirp issue with the estimate by
ic Association Against the Prohibi
-011 Amendment that the American
•ople are spending $2,848,000,000
inually for intoxicating beverages.
The Anti-Saloon League called the
itimate "wild speculation," adding
ic figures "are not based on any
mgible facts but are a synthetic
i»urc composed of one part guess
<>rk and live parts desire to dis
cdit prohibition."
Less Drinking
The Board of Temperance, Prohi
ition and Public Morals of the
tcthodist Episcopal Church said
either the Association Against the
inhibition Amendment nor anyone
se knew how much liquor was
msumed in the United States but
lere were many indications it was
very much less" than before prohi
ition.
"The absurdity of their statement,"
ie Anti-Saloon League said, "is ap
arent from their use of the figures
urporting to show per capita con
.unption of liquor when there are
o facts available anywhere as a
asis for these figures.
"Their own statement that 'most
f the liquor now consumed is
rewed at home or purchased from
cighborhood bootleggers' shows
learly that they are merely guess
ig because obviously there is no
?cord and can be none of the ex
.•n t of this source of liquor supply.
Wets Unfair
"Enforcement statistics showing
tills and liquor seized indicate ef
eiency of enforcement and are not
fair basis of estimates of consump
on. Whatever the unknown quan
ty of liquor consumption may be,
is too much, and it would be much
lore under any system.
"More important than the exact
mount being spent, whatever it may
e, is the question of how to reduce
ie quantity of liquor consumed. If
ic vast publicity favorable to liquor
/ere cut down the demand for in
jxicants would naturally decrease,
dso, if the voluble opposition to dry
iws would subside, fewer people
/ould be encouraged to drink."
