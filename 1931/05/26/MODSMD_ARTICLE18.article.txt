# SENIOR CLASS DAY PROGRAM SCHEDULE SET
## Thompson To Read Will; Plate Will Be Laid In Inner Quad 
### 
Following the precedent set by
former graduating classes, the sen
ior Class Day committee meeting
with Bill Earl, chairman, has de
cided to limit the activities of the
annual Class Day to Saturday after
noon, June 13, only. Earl yesterday
announced the program of events
scheduled for that date.
Starting at 2 o'clock Class Day ex
ercises will be held in the Memorial
Church where Joe Thompson, well
known as a campus humorist, will
read the class will, and John Isaacs
will give the class history. Vard
Loomis, senior president will deliver
a short farewell speech to the class.
At 3 o'clock the class plate will
be laid in the Inner Quad. Under
the plate cast by members of the
class in the Stanford foundry and
machined in the machine shop will
go a copy of each of the campus
publications, the roll of those gradu
ating this year, and a copy of the
Bawlout.
At 4 o'clock the commemoration
pilgrimage to the Stanford tomb will
begin. This will conclude the pro
gram of the day.
Earl expressed the hope that there
would be a large attendance through
the afternoon. In recognition of the
crowded program of Senior Week,
the committee has attempted to fit
the Class Day activities into as com
pact a space as possible, he said,
and an interesting schedule has been
planned.
At the close of Class Day Phi Beta
Kappa will hold its annual dinner
and initiation.
