# Lockout Extensions Will Be Submitted To President Swain
## 12 Midnight Leaves Proposed for Old 11:30 o'Clock Signouts; Late 2: 30 o'Clock Mid-Week Leaves To Be Reduced for Freshmen 
### 
\ HALF-HOUR extension of mid-week lockouts from 11:30 o'clock to
12 midnight was the major change in the women's regulations recom
mended by Women's Conference in a meeting Friday, the draft of which
proposed new rules and regulations will be submitted today to Acting-
President Robert E. Swain for approval. In the past, freshmen and new
first-quarter lower division women were allowed three 11:30 o'clock mid
week leaves a quarter, and eight for all other undergraduate women.
This ratio will remain unchanged under the proposed regulations except
for the advance in time from 11:30 o'clock to midnight. This change was

chiefly to allow worn
' en to see second shows in Palo Alto
without risking a lockout.
Limit Late Leaves
..Another change recommended by
Conference is the limitation of 2:30
! o'clock mid-week leaves for frcsh-
I men and new first-quarter lower
! division women to three a quarter,
1 only one of which may be used in
the same week. They will not be
allowed more than two 2:30 o'clock
| leaves a week, including a week
] end 2:30 o'clock leave.
All other women, under the pro
posed regulations, will be allowed
not more than three 2:30 o'clock
leaves a week, only one of which
may be a mid-week leave. Further
more, "if a mid-week overnight
leave is taken for social or cultural
| purposes, it shall count as the auto
matic mid-week 2:30 o'clock leave."
No Permission Needed
It will not be required under the
| new system, if approved today, for
J the women to ask permission for
1 the 2:30 o'clock leaves. Special
j leaves may be granted only by the
j president of the Associated Women
j Students, or, in case of her absence,
'by any other member of A.W.S.
Council.
Women's Conference also recorn
| mended adoption of several by
j laws in the regulations, chief among
j which is the provision prohibiting
j duplication of women participating
in the offices of any member of the
| A.W.S. Council, W.A.A. president,
J Y.W.C.A. president, member of the
Editorial Board of the Stanford
Daily, and general business manager
of the Quad, Daily, and Concert
Series.
To Affect "1933"
This proviso, if approved by
President Swain today, would take
j effect with the Class of 1933 and was
| proposed in order to encourage the
participation of a greater number of
women in student activities.
Other it?ms included in the pro
posed by-laws are the choosing of
| women less active in student activi
ties for minor positions, the sancttion
1 of a formal organization among the
f women of each class, to be developed
; in such form as the individual class
i decides, and the necessity to secure
i approval from prospective women
i candidates for student offices before
i formal nomination be made.
