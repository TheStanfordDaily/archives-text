# BENCH DECIDES WAR OATH NEED IN CITIZENSHIP
## Yale Theology Professor, War Nurse Barred By Supreme Court FOUR VOTES DISSENT Chief Justice Hughes Joins In Minority Opinion 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 25 (/P).- By
a decisive majority of one, the Su
preme Court today decided an ap
plicant for citizenship must take an
oath to fight, if necessary, for the
United States.
This conclusion was reached in the
t cases of Marie A. Bland, now in New
Kork, Canadian war nurse, and Pro
fessor Douglas Clyde Macintosh,
Yale theology professor, also a Ca-
I nadian.
Justice Sutherland delivered the
majority opinion and Justices But-
Roberts agreed. Chief Justice
Hughes read a vigorous dissent and
Justices Holmes, Brandeis and Stone,
i often found together in minority
1 opinions in the past also dissented.
Antecedent Told
The government in opposing the
naturalization of Miss Bland and
I Professor Macintosh because they
' would not take an oath to bear arms
in defense of the United States un
der all circumstances, said the ques
tion already had been settled by the
1 refusal of the court to allow Rosika
Schwimmer, Hungarian writer and
linguist, to become a citizen.
She also refused to take an oath
'to fight for the country. Justice
Sutherland took the view the cases
today were ruled by the principle
j laid down in barring her.
Chief Justice Hughes said the
! cases hjnged on the narrow point
j whether Congress had exacted a
promise to bear arms as a condition
of its grant of naturalization.
Two-Year Battle
NEW HAVEN, May 25 (/Pi.â€”Dr.
1 Douglas C. Macintosh, professor of
theology in the Yale Divinity School,
, said "my position is unaltered"
| when he received word today he had
been denied American citizenship by
a Supreme Court decision. He de
clined to comment further.
Insisting in his citizenship appli
cation and later in court hearings
that his first allegiance was to the
j will of God, Professor Mcintosh, who
lost a fight of nearly two years by
the Supreme Court decision, refused
i to make an unqualified promise to
bear arms. He said he would boar
arms only if he felt the cause was
j morally justified.
