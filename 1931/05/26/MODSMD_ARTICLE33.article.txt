"ONE PHAYS FOH A DAWN OF CLKAK LIGHT"
The "altruistically proposed Second Theater Fund Fol
lies, informal benefit vaudeville,'" have been frowned upon,
we are told. And "a soundly and carefully devised program
has received no consideration from the Powers."
All this relates to plans, and laudable ones, for raising
funds to build a new campus theater. Early this month a
spring quarter vaudeville show was proposed but, because
of the late time when the suggestion was made, was not
approved by the Dramatic Council.
This talk about soundly and carefully devised programs
being brushed aside by the "Elders'" calls to mind the fact
thai the A.S.S.I', constitution provides for Theater Fund
Committee, which is supposed to have "charge of carrying
forward the plans to raise funds for the proposed theater."
't he constitution requires that the committee meet twice a
month.
The committee has not met Ibis year. Several "mem
bers" of the committee are no longer in the I'niversity, and
yet their places on the committee have not been filled. The
committee exists to raise funds for the Theater Fund. Yet
il does nothing, and when "carefully devised" plans are
broached as the school year nears its cud and are turned
down, the Dramatic Council and the "Elders" are accused
of blocking constructive student endeavor.
If there is lassitude, and there undoubtedly is so far as
the Theater Fund is concerned, it is the fault of the inactive
Theater Fund Committee and the proponents of these be
lated "carefully devised" programs.
