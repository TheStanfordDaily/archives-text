# AN OLD SPANISH CUSTOM
## 
### 
Anions the old Spanish customs of university students
in llml sunny country has been that of participation in all
manner of public demonstrations, from revolution on down,
or up. And, of course, the stirring events surrounding the
abdication of Alfonso from the Spanish throne were pow
erful distractions to student minds. Hut professors, for
whom the glamor and excitement of parading has lost its
appeal, apparently don't appreciate the demands an abdi
cation must inevitably make upon students' lime.
Last week in Yalladolid, some fifty medical students
realized, very sensibly, that they couldn't pass their exami
nations. I hey had been 100 busy helping shove Alfonso and
liis throne into the discard, or had spent 100 much time
watching other people give Spain's king the air. Their re
quest to the faculty that they lie passed without examina
tions was refused. The students' answer to this refusal was
quite in the revolutionary manner; they locked the faculty
up in a classroom until the instructors promised to waive
the examinations.
No doubt that was a very effective solution. It brings
respect even admiration for such old Spanish customs,
from students in America. Hut one wonders whether Span
iards in u later day ma\ not be rather regretful that their
doctors spent their collegiate days in flag-waving, and for
got about medicine and surgery.
