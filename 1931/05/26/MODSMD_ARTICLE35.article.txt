Last week 'I he Daily reprinted an cm 1 ilctri:il from the
Vassar Miscellaruj News, in which I he writer voiced the ob
jection of women students to "being patted on the back and
(old not to bother our pretty heads with subjects we know
nothing about, or being told patronizingly that we arc 100
young to hear the burden of the world on our slender shoul
ders." The Vassar editor ably maintained that, "as a mat
ter of fact, we do bear the burden of the world on our
shoulders."
That women share equally with men the responsibili
ties of the world's affairs, and need and should enjoy the
educational opportunities of men, is being realized in a
country quite distant from America. In Japan, there have
been in the 1 past only three institutions of higher learning
to which women have been admitted as regular students.
These are the imperial universities of Kyushu and Tohoku
and Meiji i 'diversity. And the admission of women to these
universities is of comparatively recent date. Hut in the near
future, the portals of a technological university will be for
the tirst time in Japanese history open to women students.
Women as well as men are to be admitted to the Tokyo
t'niversilv of Technology, This is a definite step forward
in the Japanese educational system.
