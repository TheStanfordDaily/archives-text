# SO THEY SAY.....
## AN AXE FOR ANOTHER EDITOR 
### 
(The Oregon Emerald)
Another college editor was ex
pelled the other day when Gunnar
Norberg, editor of College Forum,
was charged with "conduct unbe
coming a Stanford student." Nor
berg's magazine, published off the
campus as College Forum instead of
the intended Stanford Forum, proved
objectionable to Acting President
Swain, news dispatches say.
The May issue, second published,
was sent to the Emerald editor re
cently for introduction on the cam
pus. Its standard is decidedly high.
Contributions—critical, literary, and
expository—are accredited to writ
ers in several coast universities. Its
spirit is liberal, but it is decidedly
not radical.
Perhaps it might be described as
evidencing thai student spirit and
inquiry which President Arnold
Bennett Hall would like to see on
this campus. May issue of College
Forum, we believe, is a notable con
tribution to coast magazines, colle
giate and general.
Whatever may have been Presi
dent Swain's reason for expelling
Editor Norberg (and Norberg's let
ter to the Emerald editor indicated
that there existed a personal feud),
it is to be hoped that College Forum
will continue. Norberg may or may
not have been guilty of "conduct
unbecoming a Stanford student," but
to kill College Forum would seem
to be conduct unworthy of an edu
cator.
