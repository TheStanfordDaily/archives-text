# BULL SESSION
## HOOVER'S HOME—THIS WAY 
### 
Sunday is the day of rest for all
except for those unfortunate Stan
ford students who chance to venture
within calling, beckoning, or whistl -
ing distance of the many tourist
laden roads that mark this campus.
It is annoying enough to see Buick
loads of staring faces go idling by
in hopeful attempts at spotting all
the big football stars in "The Big
Red Machine"; this can be endured.
But since 1928, a new attraction now
graces this campus; it rivals the
athletes in appeal to the masses; it
has pushed the Memorial Church
into second place; and bids fair to
become one of the greatest drawing
cards in the entire West—the Presi
dent's Home.
Now, when Herbert Hoover built
his home on the campus, he prob
ably did not contemplate that the
masses would fight to view his resi
dence; that is probably why he
placed it in such an obscure loca
tion. If he had realized that students
in his Alma Mater would be pes
tered to distraction with inquiries
as to its location, he would have
leased a plot of ground in the centor
of the inner quad or some such place
—centrally located and convenient
to direct the swarming tourists.
As it now stands, every student
that is hailed and asked how to get
to the President's Home is embar
rassed. We all know it is up past the
Post Office—but further than that
information is not reliable. Should
the tourist turn right, left, go

| straight ahead, or just stop? And
| when we attempt to evade the or
j deal by denying any knowledge of
1 (he place, the visitor draws back as
!if bitten by a cobra—or perhaps, a
i rattlesnake. Imagine—comprehend if
| you possibly can the depth of this
; sin—here is somebody who lives
| within walking distance of the home
of the President of the United
States of America —and who doesn't
know where the sacred sanctuary is
| located. Why it is almost as bad as
j being a Bolshevik—or a Democrat —
I or most anything equally evil and
| unholy.
Viewing the matter impartially,
i there seem to be only two possible
| solutions. First, the Hoover Home
can be moved into the inner quad
next to the Memorial Church; then
! with simple directions, the inquiring
j visitor can be directed easily to the
two leading attractions on the Farm.
llf this does not prove feasible,
I means must be found to direct the
I lowan hordes to the President's
i Home without asking students. We
could give out maps as people en
tered the campus; a complete and
elaborate system of sign posts could
; be installed at a very slight cost;
I and if the worst came to the worst
we students could conduct a passive
resistance campaign and paste pla
cards on our backs telling passing
cars: "We don't know where
Hoover's Home is; and if we dich,
we wouldn't tell anybody."
