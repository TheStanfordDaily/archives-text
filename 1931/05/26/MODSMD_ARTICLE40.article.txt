I GOTTA GET RICH—At the Alca
zar Theatre, San Francisco:
Henry Duffy's latest production is
I a three-act farce set in the Jewish
quarter of the East Side. Apart from
' the finished and amusing action of
' those well-known Jewish come-
I dians, Vera Gordon and Harry
! Green, the play has very little to
! recommend it. Harry Green plays
the part of the lovable but lazy in
i ventor who finally makes a fortune
! out of a machine to save housework
which he perfects when his wife
i makes him do the housework.
The first act, with its portrayal of
i the struggles of the inventor and his
j family,' is excellent and full of
I touches of excellent whimsical hu-
I mor. The second act drags despue
! occasional amusing moments and
' the last carries the farcical element
! to a height which the first two acts
I do not justify.
i The acting of Will King and J.
j Raymond Brown as the partners,
Shnaps and Shtrudel, provides most
i of the slapstick element and as
j matchmakers or business men they
| are as amusing as they are hopeless.
Spec O'Donnell, who is a newcomer
to the legitimate stage in San Fran
cisco, will be remembered as the
"dumb-looking" redheaded boy in a
number of talkies. He is the son of
1 the family who "ith going to rethite

! at the thchool commenthment ek
j therthitheth."
It is unfortunate that a slightly
! more virile actor could not have
j been cast for the part of Milton
I Kahn, the affianced of the inventor's
I daughter. Apart from this too-obvi
i qus oversight the parts are excel
j lently cast and well-acted. —S.C.A.
GREEN GROW THE LILACS—By
Lynn Riggs. Samuel French. 1931.
$2. (At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
This riproaring melodrama, dis
; guised with a couple of cowboy
j songs as an unique native drama, is
! rendered artistic and producable by
! the Theatre Guild.
Riggs has used emotions quite as
i they were used in Wild Nell: the pet
I of the plains, or Nancy in China
' town, but his atmosphere is some
! what more consistent than that in
I these other thrillers. It is, in truth,
a modernized, somewhat refined
| "ten twent' thirt' " which might have
been derived from a yellow-backed
i novel.
As an exploration of our national
dramatic resources it is hardly stu
; pendous: a churn, a candy pull, a
chariviari, several hay stacks, and
some cow country terms offer all the
remembrance of things past. It is
amusing but not at all to be con
sidered either a fine play or an addi
; tion to our native drama. —J.S.S.
