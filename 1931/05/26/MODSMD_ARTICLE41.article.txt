j The Editor, Sir:
Last night some smart fellow took i
I on himself the task of tossing a piece j
I of metal out of a third-story window j
|of Encina. Hall. Unfortunately for j
! me and luckily for a friend of mine j
| it landed on the top of my Ford!
j coupe and after smashing the top ]
j in it bounced off to the bapk of the j
| car, making some dents. When this ;
i smart fellow threw this from his j
| towering position a friend of mine I
was standing near the car, in fact j
i within three feet. He and I are still i
speculating on what would ' have i
j happened if this had hit him. In !
| the interim a new top is being put i
| on the car, dents taken out, and a j
new Duco put on. I have learned a j
! l ather expensive lesson not to park ;
j a car near Encina and I hope a few I
j fellows will remember to be a little !
more careful what they throw out j
jof Encina windows. —Bill Plymat.
