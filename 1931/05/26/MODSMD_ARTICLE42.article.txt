# MORE ABOUT THE LEAGUE

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In a recent attack on both the |
I League of Nations and the World [
i Court, Mr. Richard W. Dickenson i
1 expressed himself as a supporter of ;
! Hearst isolationism; but in doing so,
1 he discussed only the League, as if
i the same arguments applied to it
| and the Court. At least one out
! standing difference makes his casual
| dismissal of the Court unjustified;
I namely, th;it the Court settles dis
-1 putes on the basis of international
law, while the League's settlements,
except when conforming to advisory
| opinions of the World Court, are
j based on political expediency. It is
understandable, though unfortunate,
| that this country should refuse to i
j join the League for fear of getting 1
the worst of some political transac
| tion, but it is ridiculous for the
I United States to remain aloof from
a tribunal of international law on!
I the grounds of the same fear.
Jf America's adherence to the
1 World Court will be in the interest
of peace, and if it will not jeopardize 1
1 the just rights of this country by
' promoting unfair treatment of the
United States by other powers; 1
think it is perfectly reasonable to
say that such adherence is justified.
The past record of I he Court in I

| dealing with international questions
j leaves very little doubt as to its
! efficacy as a mechanism of settle
ment. When it settled Ihe German -
Polish expropriation disputes some
i time after the war, it handled mat- j
I ters of no small international im- |
j portance. It has so far rendered 1(5 j
| judgments and 18 advisory opinions. ;
Nothing in the nature of disputes
| involving the United States would
j render them any less susceptible of
judicial settlement than those which
I the Court has already handled; and j
| such settlement would certainly be [
j an aid to peace.
America has several significant
I assurances of its safety from unfa
j vorable discrimination at the hands
of the Court. First, the United States
i can look for the Court's respect of
i its own law in cases where that law
j applies; for such has already been
the practice of the Court with re
gard to the internal law of parties to
disputes adjudicated by it, where
that law does not conflict with the \
international agreements or interna- j
tional law. Secondly, under the pro- j
visions of the Root Formula, the |
j United States would be able to have j
' an open exchange of views with the j
! Council of the League regarding the
I rendering by the Court of any ad
visory opinion affecting the inter
ests of the United States; and this
country would have a full vote at
the Council table in determining
I whether any such opinion should be |
requested of the. Court. Finally, the |
i only disputes which the United
I States would have to submit to the I
Court would be those arising under
[ treaties recognizing the jurisdiction
'of the Court, and those which the
j United States might specifically
j agree to submit to it. The confidence i
iof this country should be inspired
by the fact that 35 of the member i
nations of the Court'have agreed to j
the optional clause providing for
I compulsory jurisdiction of the Court |
5 over a large class of legal disputes, j
if any such should arise among I
| them. â€”Wayne A. Bannister.
