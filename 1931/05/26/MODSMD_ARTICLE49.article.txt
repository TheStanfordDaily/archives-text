HARVARD'S RECORD
Yale squeezed out a win over
Harvard on the track and field
Saturday, but that doesn't mean
that dear old Eli is going to
finish ahead of the Crimson in
this IC4A affair at Philadelphia
on Saturday next. In fact, the
results which gave Yale a WMi'S
victory over its ancient rival in
dicated just the opposite.
The secret is simply that the
lavahhd boys took more first places
han Yale, and in so doing turned
n some performances that will
eckon right up in the money with
hose of the invading horde of rough
:nd tough Westerners. Not that Har
vard as a team has a chance to
jpset the dope bucket. Its place in
he heap after final tabulations will
je about fourth, behind U.S.C.,
Stanford, and the Quakers from
Pennsylvania, in that order.
If Messrs. Cromwell and Tern
pleton have any designs on first
place hurdle points, they had
better start doping some way to
beat out this Crimson-clad Eu
gene Record. Record won the
IC4A highs last year in 15 flat
after Podge Smith led him most
of the way and then fell down
after being almost a cinch to
win. Troy's stellar low-barrier
team, Ernie Payne and Itill
Carls, both beat Record in the
lows.
.4*. <t>
Until last Saturday, it looked as
hough Gene was fizzling out this
/ear. A week previous he had need
d 15.G seconds to /negotiate 120
/ards over the tall sticks. But Sat
jrday, Record took the lead out of
lis heels to run a flight of highs in
4.4, equalling the world's record
leld jointly by Steve Anderson,
Washington's 1930 champion, and
Sari Thompson. To show it was no
luke, Record came back and won
he lows in 23.1, about three-tenths
aster than Mr. Payne has ever run.
Podge Smith and A1 Nisbet will
lave pretty tough sledding Satur
day, not only because of the pres
ence of the Crimson flash, but also
because one Jerry Devoe, Yale cap
lain, will be on hand. Df>voe ran the
highs in 14.8 against Princeton a
while back, and last Saturday was
a meagre yard and a half behind
Record in his record-equalling per
formance.
<4> <§> <«>
The IC4A half-mile has been
doped all along as pretty much
an all-Eastern affair, unless
Tcmpleton decides to run Ben
Eastman in that event. But not
so many were figuring a guy
named Dave Cobb of Harvard
for anything like 1:54.8, the time
. he recorded against Yale. Since
Ben could coast around in those
figures, we'll leave Mr. Cobb for
Fitzmaurice, McGcagh, and
Cromwell the dean to worry
about.
As for sprinters, Yale and Har
vard could get together and nomi
nate only one man w4io is capable
of a point or so at Philadelphia.
W. W. Boyd (probably Bill) cleaned
up the dashes for old Eli with times
of 10 flat and 21.3. Even time in the
century is practically nothing at all
in this day of track, but no one can
sneer at 21.3. It looks as though
Boyd gets better as the distance
longer. Yale's coach ought
to try this boy in the 440.
The Crimson's track prowess
is just about summed up, ex
cept for a fair quarter-miler,
one N. P. (probably Nimrod)
Dodge, who scampered around
one lap Saturday in 49.1. Until
recently, Yale had a 440 man
who could equal this time, a
fellow named A1 Sumner. He
pulled a muscle a couple of
weeks ago, however, and will
probably not run Saturday.
On the field, Harvard took the
pole vault and javelin honors awny
rom Eli with performances that
savor of IC4A digits. Oscar Sutir
neister soared 13 feet 3 inches to
indicate that he is rounding into
orm, while Vic Harding was win
ling the spear-throwing contest
vvilh a toss of 185 feet 6 inches. That
sn't too good, but Harding wasn't
pressed. A week earlier he flung the
weapon out 198 feet. Yale's only
'ield threat is* Joe Crowley, who
lirew the discus 148 feet 8 inches.
Somebody with a sense of
luimor wrote up for the press
the Trojan stop-over workout
Saturday at Douglas, Arizona.
He reported that "only one
casualty marred the workout
when Ken McKen/.ie suffered a
nosebleed on account of the high
altitude." Ken McKenzie is only
a fair javelin tosser, figured for
a possible point in the meet.
If Frankic "the great" YVykoff
had lost an ounce of blood, we
probably would have read about
a "fatality." —Crawford.

The IC4A half-mile has been

an all-Eastern affair, unless

so many were figuring a guy
named Dave Cobb of Harvard
for anything like 1:54.8, the time

Ben could coast around in those

Fitzmaurice, McGcagh, and

W. W. Boyd (probably Bill) cleaned
up the dashes for old Eli with times

Boyd gets better as the distance
longer. Yale's coach ought
to try this boy in the 440.
The Crimson's track prowess
is just about summed up, ex

one N. P. (probably Nimrod)

who could equal this time, a
fellow named A1 Sumner. He
pulled a muscle a couple of
weeks ago, however, and will
probably not run Saturday.
On the field, Harvard took the
pole vault and javelin honors awny
rom Eli with performances that
savor of IC4A digits. Oscar Sutir
neister soared 13 feet 3 inches to
indicate that he is rounding into
orm, while Vic Harding was win
ling the spear-throwing contest
vvilh a toss of 185 feet 6 inches. That
sn't too good, but Harding wasn't
pressed. A week earlier he flung the
weapon out 198 feet. Yale's only
'ield threat is* Joe Crowley, who
lirew the discus 148 feet 8 inches.
Somebody with a sense of
luimor wrote up for the press
the Trojan stop-over workout
Saturday at Douglas, Arizona.
He reported that "only one

altitude." Ken McKenzie is only
a fair javelin tosser, figured for
a possible point in the meet.

HARVARD'S RECORD
Yale squeezed out a win over
Harvard on the track and field
Saturday, but that doesn't mean
that dear old Eli is going to
finish ahead of the Crimson in
this IC4A affair at Philadelphia
on Saturday next. In fact, the
results which gave Yale a WMi'S
victory over its ancient rival in
dicated just the opposite.
The secret is simply that the
lavahhd boys took more first places
han Yale, and in so doing turned
n some performances that will
eckon right up in the money with
hose of the invading horde of rough
:nd tough Westerners. Not that Har
vard as a team has a chance to
jpset the dope bucket. Its place in
he heap after final tabulations will
je about fourth, behind U.S.C.,
Stanford, and the Quakers from
Pennsylvania, in that order.
If Messrs. Cromwell and Tern
pleton have any designs on first
place hurdle points, they had
better start doping some way to
beat out this Crimson-clad Eu
gene Record. Record won the
IC4A highs last year in 15 flat
after Podge Smith led him most
of the way and then fell down
after being almost a cinch to
win. Troy's stellar low-barrier

The IC4A half-mile has been
doped all along as pretty much
an all-Eastern affair, unless
Tcmpleton decides to run Ben
Eastman in that event. But not
so many were figuring a guy
named Dave Cobb of Harvard
for anything like 1:54.8, the time
. he recorded against Yale. Since
Ben could coast around in those
figures, we'll leave Mr. Cobb for
Fitzmaurice, McGcagh, and
Cromwell the dean to worry
about.
As for sprinters, Yale and Har
vard could get together and nomi
nate only one man w4io is capable
of a point or so at Philadelphia.
W. W. Boyd (probably Bill) cleaned
up the dashes for old Eli with times
of 10 flat and 21.3. Even time in the
century is practically nothing at all
in this day of track, but no one can
sneer at 21.3. It looks as though
Boyd gets better as the distance
longer. Yale's coach ought
to try this boy in the 440.
The Crimson's track prowess
is just about summed up, ex
cept for a fair quarter-miler,
one N. P. (probably Nimrod)
Dodge, who scampered around
one lap Saturday in 49.1. Until
recently, Yale had a 440 man
who could equal this time, a
fellow named A1 Sumner. He
pulled a muscle a couple of
weeks ago, however, and will
probably not run Saturday.
On the field, Harvard took the
pole vault and javelin honors awny
rom Eli with performances that
savor of IC4A digits. Oscar Sutir
neister soared 13 feet 3 inches to
indicate that he is rounding into
orm, while Vic Harding was win
ling the spear-throwing contest
vvilh a toss of 185 feet 6 inches. That
sn't too good, but Harding wasn't
pressed. A week earlier he flung the
weapon out 198 feet. Yale's only
'ield threat is* Joe Crowley, who
lirew the discus 148 feet 8 inches.
Somebody with a sense of
luimor wrote up for the press
the Trojan stop-over workout
Saturday at Douglas, Arizona.
He reported that "only one
casualty marred the workout
when Ken McKen/.ie suffered a
nosebleed on account of the high
altitude." Ken McKenzie is only
a fair javelin tosser, figured for
a possible point in the meet.

HARVARD'S RECORD
Yale squeezed out a win over
Harvard on the track and field
Saturday, but that doesn't mean
that dear old Eli is going to
finish ahead of the Crimson in
this IC4A affair at Philadelphia
on Saturday next. In fact, the
results which gave Yale a WMi'S
victory over its ancient rival in
dicated just the opposite.
The secret is simply that the
lavahhd boys took more first places
han Yale, and in so doing turned
n some performances that will
eckon right up in the money with
hose of the invading horde of rough
:nd tough Westerners. Not that Har
vard as a team has a chance to
jpset the dope bucket. Its place in
he heap after final tabulations will
je about fourth, behind U.S.C.,
Stanford, and the Quakers from
Pennsylvania, in that order.
If Messrs. Cromwell and Tern
pleton have any designs on first
place hurdle points, they had
better start doping some way to
beat out this Crimson-clad Eu
gene Record. Record won the
IC4A highs last year in 15 flat
after Podge Smith led him most
of the way and then fell down
after being almost a cinch to
win. Troy's stellar low-barrier
team, Ernie Payne and Itill
Carls, both beat Record in the
lows.

Until last Saturday, it looked as
hough Gene was fizzling out this
/ear. A week previous he had need
d 15.G seconds to /negotiate 120
/ards over the tall sticks. But Sat
jrday, Record took the lead out of
lis heels to run a flight of highs in
4.4, equalling the world's record
leld jointly by Steve Anderson,
Washington's 1930 champion, and
Sari Thompson. To show it was no
luke, Record came back and won
he lows in 23.1, about three-tenths
aster than Mr. Payne has ever run.
Podge Smith and A1 Nisbet will
lave pretty tough sledding Satur
day, not only because of the pres
ence of the Crimson flash, but also
because one Jerry Devoe, Yale cap
lain, will be on hand. Df>voe ran the
highs in 14.8 against Princeton a
while back, and last Saturday was
a meagre yard and a half behind
Record in his record-equalling per
formance.
