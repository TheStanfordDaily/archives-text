# TEMPLETON FAMOUS DEVELOPER OF CHAMPION QUARTER-MILERS
## Editor's Note: This is the next to the last of a series of articles dealing with the great track stars developed by Dink Templeton.

Besides being without a peer
as a coach of weightmen, Dink
Templeton is probably the great
est developer of champion quar
ter-milers in the country and in
connection with this activity the
outstanding developer of mile re
lay teams.
His man Ben Eastman is the
present unofficial holder of the
world's 440 record of 47.4, along
with Ted Meredith. His 1931 re
lay team recently covered the
four laps in the amazing time of
3:12.6 to set up a new world's
record.
Since 1921 when Dink took
over the coaching reins, Stanford
has not been without a capable
440 man, but the Halcyon days
commenced in 1924 with the ad
vent of Ted Miller and Bill
Richardson.
Cutting under 50 fiat for the
first time that year, Miller
cleaned up the coast in 1925 and
'26. He was unfortunately the
first of Dink's 440 men to fail in
the East. Best clocking on him
was 48.6. With Storie, Babcock,
and Richardson he formed the
first of Stanford's mighty mile
relay teams (3:17.6).
Besides his relay activities,
Richardson ran the half-mile
faster than anyone in the West.
Occasionally beaten during the
'24 and '25 seasons, he was in
vincible in '26, except in the
IC4A. Although he had finished
third in his first Eastern inva
sion two years before and run

1:53.8 on the coast that season the
best he could do was fifth.
In 1927 and '28, the famous
Bud Spencer was winning one
lap races and mile relays for
Stanford. When he went East in
'28, he had been timed in 47.7 for
the quarter-mile, set a new
world's record of 47 fiat for the
400 metres, and anchored a 3:18.8
relay team; yet he was beaten by
Barbuti in the intercollegiates
and failed to make the Olympic
team as anything but a member
of the 1600-metre relay team. He
gained some measure of solace by
anchoring this team to a new
world's record both in the mile
and 1600-metre races, but his
name must be added to the list
of Eastern failures.
Johnny Morrison (48.6) proved
himself a worthy successor to
Spencer in '29 and '30, but he was
unable to place in the IC4A. In
1930 he ran anchor on a 3:15.4
relay team after Shove, Howell,
and Ike Hables. The last-named
proved his greatness by beating
Vic Williams in 48.8 in last year's
California intercollegiates. May
nor Shove (48.6) has been beat
ing Ike all this year. Los Hables
(48 fiat) trims them both.
Which brings us up to Ben
Bangs Eastman (47.4 in the quar
ter and 1:53 in the half) who ran
a 47.2 anchor lap for that relay
team, and who if he continues to
improve at his present rate will
be running 44.6 in his senior
year. Wonder what ho is going
to do in the East?
