# A'S SLUG WAY TO DOUBLE WIN OVER N.Y. CLUB
## Macks Stretch Consecutive Game Victories To 17 In Great Drive 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, May 25. (/P) â€”
The world champion Philadelphia
Athletics found themselves within
striking distance of the American
League record for consecutive vic
tories today, as they trounced the
New York Yankees in both ends of
a double bill to win their 16th and
17 th straight contests.
Way back in 1906, the Chicago
White Sox staged a September
streak that netted them 19 straight
triumphs, a mark that stood until
1916 when the New York Giants
hung up 26 consecutive wins for the
all-time record.
The A's won today behind splen
did pitching by Lefty Grove and
Roy Mahaffey, the former outpitch
ing Johnson of the Yanks in the
opener, 4-2, and the latter coasting
to a 12-4 win as his teammates
hammered a trio of New York hurl
ers for 14 hits. By their victory, the
champions increased their first
place lead to a margin of five lull
games over the Washington Sena
tors, who were rained out at Boston
today.
