# Army Planes Repel Mythical Atlantic Coast Air Invasion
## 
### 
BOSTON, May 25 (TP).â€”New Eng
land thrilled today to the onrush of
nearly 700 army airplanes that swept
eastward to the sea from Springfield,
and Hartford, to repel a mythical in
vader, threatening the coast.
One group of 36 raced northward
across Maine, New Hampshire and
Vermont to come to rest, finally, at
the airports of Schenectady and Al
bany, N.Y. More than 600 others
took part in a demonstration over
Boston. The planes later flew back
over southern New England to the
four airports at Springfield and
Hartford, at which they were quar
tered. But before the day was
closed, another aerial demonstration
was given over Springfield.
In Boston schools were closed and
hundreds of thousands crowded the
wide-sweeping shores of Dorchester
Bay. There, a crack group of pur
suit, attack and bombing planes, 39
in number, roared through the sky
in attack demonstration and combat
acrobatics.
