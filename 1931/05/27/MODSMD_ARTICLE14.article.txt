## Chiang Kai-Shek Accuses Reds Of Revolt 
### 
NANKING, CHINA, May 2G (/P).â€”
Threats of another civil war loomed
ominously today on China's troub
led horizon as political circles pre
dicted the government would open
hostilities against Kwangtung and
Kwangsi province rebels within a
few days.
Trouble has been brewing in
Southern China for several weeks,
but events were brought to a head
yesteday by President Chiang Kai
shek, whose denunciation of the
rebels brought forth open forecasts
of warfare.
Chiang accused southern Commu
nists of attempts to overthrow his
government after his refusal to re
sign.
"The crisis was essentially one be
tween the Kuomingtang (national
people's party) and the Commu
nists," he declared in a statement.
"The latter were desirous of exert
ing influence in Kuomintang circles,
thereby hoping to gain power within
the Nationalist government, which
was subject to direction by the Kuo
mintang."
Chiang declared the Reds were
dominating the South China faction,
causing it to x~ebel against Nanking
authority.
"The government thus was forced
to choose between accepting Com
munists into the party or resorting
to war," he said.
Chiang announced Sun Fo, son
of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the
Chinese republic, Eugene Chen, for
mer Nationalist Minister of Foreign
Affairs, and Wang Ching - wei,
youthful communistically inclined
Kuomintang leader, have joined the
revolt against Nanking.
