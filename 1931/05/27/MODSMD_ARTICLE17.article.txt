# Major Parties Shun Definite Tax Stand In 1932 Campaigns
## Political Chieftains Flee Outspoken Statements As $900,000,000 Treasury Deficit Clouds Capitol Skies for Presidential Elections 
### 
Ilf ASIiINGTON, May 2(>. (A 3 ) —Noticeable in discussions over the possible 1
.$900,000.000 deficit this year is the lack of a definite recommendation !
for a tax increase from official headquarters of either party. The nevv j
Congress meeting in December is almost equally divided politically. That
session runs directly into the presidential campaign and increasing taxes |
at such a time causes political leaders to ponder considerably. Repub- |
lican independents who will hold the balance of power next session have i
called for a tax increase. Without the support of regulars of either major

party who control the House Ways !
jiiul Means Committee a tax revision
is doubtful.

President Hoover is asking de- |
partment chiefs to reduce govern- |
ment exenditures but the recent \
statements of Secretary Mellon and j
Undersecretary Mills of the Treas
ury faild to give any hope for per- j
panent lowering of the budget.
Senator Hull, Democrat, Tennes
see, warns that the peace-time level 1
of governmental expenditures is al- i
ready on the increase "and it will j
be greater for 1931 and subsequent j
years."
Debate Tax Increase
While a tax increase next session '
is not in sight, already there is argu- I
ment as to how the burden of such j
an increase shall be distributed j
when it is ordered. This debate be- j
comes more pertinent in the thought j
of congressional leaders that a fu- 1
ture boost in taxes will be more or |
less permanent.
