# Campus Dinky Rests In Limbo Of Forgotten Day

! Ripping up the quarter-mile of
track beside the power house marks
i the passing of the last trace of the
campus trolley, which gladdened and
! enriched the lives of Stanford stu
; dents before this year. Thir; year s
! class of freshmen missed the great
i est thrill of collegiate life—a ride
into Palo Alto on the Toonervillc
after the annual Pajamarino.
The rusted and time-worn rails
have been sold to a railroad com
pany, said Roy H. Button, superin
j tendent at the corporation yard,
; yesterday. The splintered and bug
i eaten lies will be divided into two
1 piles—one for the military depart
ment to use" in construction of a
i "new" riding ring and the other for
the annual conflagration to add in
sult to injury on the badgered Bears
j of Berkeley.
| Years ago the tracks in Palo Alto
were extended along the highway to
the start of Lasuen Street, up
) through the trees past the stadium,
along the road to Encina and doub
ling back in back of the Stanford
i bookstore crossing Lasuen and end
j ing in a loop in front of Roble.

The Paly tracks were removed
and the "Dinky" became the only
tram closer than Los Altos. Then
the run from the bookstore to Roble
was discontinued to avoid the heavy
traffic of Lasuen. Then came the
sad day when the car service
stopped, the last car sneaking away
from the campus two hours early
to escape a unique send-off planned
by students.
The administration built the new
strip of track to permit transporta
tion of oil to the power house. The
use of gas is the final advance of
civilization that has obliterated the
campus tracks.
In its heyday, the "Dinky" was the
scene of many of the campus rev
elries and the cause of gray hairs to
the Administration. Frequently the
controls would be "lost" in a fresh
man's pocket and the Skipper in
deed was a half-hour late on his
run. One night someone yanked the
trolley and short-circuited the entire
telephone and lighting system on the
campus causing several hours of
darkness and two days of bliss for
the Toyon operator and the Daily
telephone answerer.
