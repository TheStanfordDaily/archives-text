MADRID, May 2G. (/P)Army units
and extra forces of civil guards were
called out in two widely separated
regions today, Andalucia and San
Sebastian, to deal with threatened
labor disturbances arising from un
employment.
It was explained that the action
was taken to aid the general eco

had found it necessary to reduce tlie
interest rates paid on deposits by
them.
The order affects all general and
special deposits of government
money and applies to about $100,-
000,000 held as deposits by banks
throughout the country.
