## Jurist Tells Of Republic History in Lecture 
### 
That Venezuela will work its way
j out to a future more prosperous
| than the past, was the prophecy of
Judge Jackson H. Ralston, who out
| lined the history of the South
I American republic in the Little
Theater last night.
"And with its advancement will
| come increasing enlightenment for
| the common people," he added. "The
| poor people are ignorant to a pain
i ful degree. What money the coun
try does spend on education is for
j the universities."
j "Oil has done wonders for Vene
i zuela," said Judge Ralston. "The tax
i upon oil has resulted in good roads,
as fine as any we have in the Uni
; ted States. Many of the cities are
: well-paved and excellently cared for
j by the tax.
( "The government up to the time
iof Gomez, at least, was largely a
; personal affair. The president dipped
; his hands into the treasury as he
j saw fit. Now there is a regular
budget and all the money has to be
i accounted for. But what is called
"honest graft" is not entirely un
! known in Venezuela, any more than
j in parts of the United States."
Judge Ralston described Castro as
| one of the most celebrated of Vene
| zuelan presidents—a man who knew
! his Venezuela better than any other
! country. The period of the adminis-
I tration of Gomez, which lasted from
j 1909 until recently, was one of ma
terial prosperity.
Venezuela preserves the memory
|of its struggles with Spain in its
| flag, which, made of three bars of
i yellow, blue, and red, is said to sym
! bolizc a blue ocean flowing between
j a golden Venezuela and a bloody
j Spain.
