■ of violating the Honor Code by copying an English paper
verbatim, one student was suspended from school for three quarters
by Men s Council yesterday. Guido Caglieri, chairman of the council,
issued a warning to the effect that all term papers and reports must b«
signed with the code pledge before they will be read for grades. No
exceptions to this rule will be made, he said, and readers in all courses

liavc been asked to enforce it.
The council also suspended per
manently another student for "con
duct unbecoming a Stanford gentle
man.'' He was convicted of theft in
connection with the removal without
permission of equipment and alcohol
from the science laboratories.
A special warning was issued that
copying from any source without
giving credit to the original author
of the material will be considered
violation of the code and will be
punished as such. This is not a new
regulation, but the council wishes
to call it to the attention of the
students so that the seriousness of
such an offense and its penalty may
be fully comprehended.
This action is the culmination of a
series of sentences handed down by
the council, and it is in accordance
with the former decision of rhe
council that the names of the of
fenders are not to be published, the
stand being taken that such action
has too permanent effects for the
severity of the offense.
