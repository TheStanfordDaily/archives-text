# DOING THEIR JOB
## 
### 
Another man has violated the Stanford Honor Code,
and he lias been punished. Yesterday the Men's Council)
suspended a student from the I niversitv for three quarters j
for cheating. He had copied verbatim a paper for an Eng-j
lisli course.
This man had thought he could cheat and get away with i
it. He couldn't. He didn't belong at Stanford, and his dis
honest conduct forced him out of the University for three j
quarters.
The Councils have been panned freely for many months'
for their indifferent attitude toward Honor ('ode enforce-,
ment. But yesterday's conviction and others that have pre
ceded it are indicative of the changing viewpoint of the
Associated Students toward the Honor Code. After laugh
ing at the Honor Code so long it had become almost a I
campus joke, or tragedy, they have begun to realize that
the ('ode deserves an opportunity to succeed or fail.
And the Councils are giving the Code the chance itj
needs. Guilty offenders are being punished, and with the
severity they deserve. In time a sentiment may develop on
the campus so that a student not only will not want to)
cheat, but he won't dare to.
If the Councils do their job, the Honor Code will work.
The Councils are doing that job now.
