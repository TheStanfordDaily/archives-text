BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE
(Penn State Collegian)
Several years ago when officials
at Penn State announced their pol
icy of not awarding athletic scholar
ships, a wave of comment passed
over both alumni and students. Na
turally this comment was both fa
vorable and unfavorable to a policy
which made Penn State one of the
pioneer institutions in placing its
athletics on an extremely high level.
Forgetting the fact that officials here
were building for the future, nega
tive criticism grew louder if the
teams failed to win a large portion
of their scheduled contests.
It was natural that a slight drop
in the quality of teams should be
noticed after the sudden elimination
of all athletic scholarships. It will
take a few years for officials here to
build up from, the material received
teams of equal quality to the teams
produced by Penn State during
scholarship days. Not unmindful of
a certain amount of "street corner"
criticism which followed some of his
policies, Dean Hugo Bezdek con -
tinued his plan of building for the
future by firmly establishing intra
mural sports here with a motto of
"athletics for all."
The finest thing about Penn State's
athletic policy may be found in the
fact that it is not merely "outlined"'
when the College year begins, but
definite plans are instigated whereby
this policy may be successfully car
ried out. The newest of these was
announced by Dean Bezdek in to
day's Collegian. It reveals that col
lege credits will be given next year
for participation in intramural
sports.
Now it is possible that not only a
greater number of students will take
part in sports at Penn State, but
varsity material may be uncovered
by coaches who will supervise con
tests. For the intramural winter
sports are scheduled in the fall
months and instructors will be given
ample opportunity to comb material
for possible varsity candidates.

Perm State can well be proud of
the stand it has taken to decommer
cialize college athletics. Teams pro
duced here can take their places
beside those at many colleges whose
policies are still blemished by sub
sidization. And there is no doubt
that Penn State teams, developed
under a system that has for its ideals
the finest ideals of sport, will reach
the highest peak of collegiate sport
dom within a few years.

over both alumni and students. Na
turally this comment was both fa
vorable and unfavorable to a policy
which made Penn State one of the
pioneer institutions in placing its
athletics on an extremely high level.
Forgetting the fact that officials here
were building for the future, nega
tive criticism grew louder if the
teams failed to win a large portion
of their scheduled contests.
It was natural that a slight drop
in the quality of teams should be
noticed after the sudden elimination
of all athletic scholarships. It will
take a few years for officials here to
build up from, the material received
teams of equal quality to the teams
produced by Penn State during
scholarship days. Not unmindful of
a certain amount of "street corner"
criticism which followed some of his
policies, Dean Hugo Bezdek con -
tinued his plan of building for the
future by firmly establishing intra
mural sports here with a motto of
"athletics for all."
The finest thing about Penn State's
athletic policy may be found in the
fact that it is not merely "outlined"'
when the College year begins, but
definite plans are instigated whereby
this policy may be successfully car
ried out. The newest of these was
announced by Dean Bezdek in to
day's Collegian. It reveals that col
lege credits will be given next year
for participation in intramural
sports.
Now it is possible that not only a
greater number of students will take
part in sports at Penn State, but
varsity material may be uncovered
by coaches who will supervise con
tests. For the intramural winter
sports are scheduled in the fall
months and instructors will be given
ample opportunity to comb material
for possible varsity candidates.

Perm State can well be proud of
the stand it has taken to decommer
cialize college athletics. Teams pro
duced here can take their places
beside those at many colleges whose
policies are still blemished by sub
sidization. And there is no doubt
that Penn State teams, developed
under a system that has for its ideals
the finest ideals of sport, will reach
the highest peak of collegiate sport
dom within a few years.
