# CABBAGES and Things..
## 
### 
We've gotten down to the end
of the year where most of us
count ten before cashing a one
dollar check, then walk away in
a hurry, before people start
asking questions, hoping the
thing doesn't bounce till we've
at least reached the corner with
the package of life savers. Col
lege daze!
No one has commented, till it's
practically too late, about the new
rooting stand installed on the foot
ball practice field, this spring. It's a
thing that's rolled up and down the
I field, with a real purpose of letting
| all the boys in on the intimate work
i ings of all the plays, whether they're
jin action or not. But incidentally
| it's a swell means of getting them
j used to worshippers on the sidelines.
| All that's lacking is a couple of
i Rally Committee women in white
| sweaters, giving wrong directions . ..

The old place is getting to look
more like summer quarter and less
like spring, every day. If only the
cloudburst had come a little sooner,
we might at least have had a couple
of frogs in Lagunita. As it is,
j chances of really interesting fires
are blotted out for a day or so, and
! the true romantic wanderers among
I us have to follow an ordinary liter
ary gleam, instead of the fire
whistle.
Working up the census reports
for the month, we ask. "Has
anyone among you ever hit the
; traffic light at the highway in
tersection right, so that you
didn't have to shift and curse
the valley fruit farm delivery
system?"
On the subject of gates again,
j there's a set of ornamental black
and gold spiked things, down at the
j entrance to the Convalescent Home
grounds, that's too good to miss
' comment. You know, Renaissance
literature has a lot to say about
! pearly gates and the gates to hell,
I and, and, and—but there's no telling
; what the monstrosities around here
have been suggested by. The dreams
jof an architect who flunked out,
! maybe.
Personally speaking, we re
fuse to he satisfied till there's
an arch connecting the Palm
Drive Pillars, and the Univer
sity motto changed to lit: Hold
tight while entering, ye seekers
of knowledge. The wind is free,
only the blowers must he paid.
I $99, or you walk home.
