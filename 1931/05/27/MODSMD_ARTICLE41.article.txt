## WHY THAT "NEXT WAR?" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Hardly can one pick up one's
morning paper without some scare
head line striking the eye as to the
"next war."
In spite of having fought to a
finish the late "war to end War" it
would seem from the paragraphing
prophets that another war, far more
devlish and destructive than the
last, is imminent and inevitable.
Professing trust in, and giving lip
service to, the Prince of Peace their
real belief is in Inexorable Fate,
"that which hath been it is that
which it shall be."

Is poor Humanity so helpless? Our
late President voiced a different
program. Said he: "It is for.the
generation that survived the world
war to devise measures of preven
tion. If we fail in this we shall de
serve all the disaster which will
surely be visited on us because of
our failure."

Today our President tells the In
ternational Chamber of Commerce
|of the "failure to secure Peace
through competitive arms or intimi
dation." Across the water a British
ambassador tells that he concurred
with the German Foreign Minister
that the "mismanagement and stu
pidity" of all the statesmen con
cerned caused the late World War.
To this Lloyd George adds that their
motives call for the "withering con
tempt of humanity."
Today these same "statesmen" arc
endeavoring to persuade the public
that every nation is endangered by
the armaments of every other;
Britain endangered by Americaj
America endangered by Japan, Italy
by France, etc. By the Kellogg pact
all nations foreswore war.
Obviously, then President Hoover's
counsel, disarmament, is not only
logical but wise and possible; the
disarmed northern border line of
the U.S.A., where neither nation
has fired shot or drawn sword in
over a century, being not only an
inspiring demonstration of possi
bility, but an example which the
world must follow. Justice, not
Force, must and will ensure Peace;
and the World's Public Opinion be
mobilized to condemn the idiocy, of
War. Armies and navies have failed!
Try Common Sense!
