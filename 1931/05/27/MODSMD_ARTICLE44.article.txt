## WHAT IS CHEATING? 
### 
It is quite easy to say: "Enforce
the Code; and punish the violators."
Anyone knows that copying another
person's examination is considered
a violation of the Code; it is also
fairly well fixed that using notes
or books in quizes is not the honor
able thing to be caught doing. But
what about the host of other things
in preparing class work? The phrase,
"No Unpermitted Aid Given or Re
ceived," is just a way of hedging,
for does anybody know what kind of
aid is unpermitted?
If I loan my lecture notes to stu
dents who overslept, am I violating
the Honor Code? If some friend
wishes to take a few days off in the
golden paradise of southern Cali
fornia and as a result missed several
classes, can I legally permit him to
read my notes? If a person were to
have such a splitting headache on
Monday morning due to a too ex
citing week-end, can one of his
friends take lecture notes for him?
Or to name a more usual situation,
can two classmates get together and
study each other's notes for their
mutual advantage? There is no
doubt that they would be profiting
from work other than their own.
It is unfair to leave students in
the dark as to what the Honor Code
means; and then jump on them for
violating it. I am not criticizing the
Councils for prosecuting and con
victing violators; that is their busi
ness. But the student body is justi
fied in knowing what is the mean
ing of the word, "unpermitted." It
seems that with finals rounding the

corner, it might be very profitable
if the Council would get into a hud
dle and proclaim to the world just
when a cheater is a cheater.

It may be that they will find the
task of drawing the line impossible
in the few days before The Daily's
last edition. If that is so, then let
them issue a statement or pass a
resolution—or do whatever official
bodies do to make known their
wishes—to the effect that unpermit
ted aid during Spring Quarter 1931
will consist solely of cheating in
the writing of examinations.
If the Council fails to make such
o statement, the students will enter
these last weeks without knowing
whether to feel the pride of the
honest or the sorrow and fear of
the wicked. The whole problem can
be evaded by "leaving the problem
to the discretion and honor of the
students." That sounds elevating;
but it is impossible to fairly convict
people for violating something whose
only authority is their own personal
sense of propriety.
It would be as bad as leaving the
definition of intoxicating liquors to
be determined by each citizen's
taste rather than setting the per
centage by law. If anything like a
beginning of uniformity is to exist
under the Honor Code (and the
Code still exists even for those Who
do not believe in it), the Councils
-must act, and fairly rapidly at that.
The opportunity is theirs; the re
sponsibility rests with them. They
cannot pass the buck to the faculty
or the students in defining "unper
mitted." —Abe Mellinkoff.
