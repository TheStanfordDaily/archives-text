MIRACLE AT VERDUN—By Hans
Chlumberg. Brentano's. 1931. $2.
(A< the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Hcrr Chlumberg's Guilded drama
is not of any particular worth either
idealistically or dramatically: his
purpose might better have been ex
plained in an econ class and his
play is too baldly propaganda, too
poorly written to be taken seriously.
The Herr has made his characters
dunderheaded, unreal, unconvinc
ing. And apparently something ap
proaching an antipathy for the
French is still in his peace-preach
ing mind: whereas the German
Chancellor sleeps with Frau Chan
cellor, the French Premier snoozes
with Mile. Odette—and in lurid pa
jamas.
If Chlumberg hadn't tripped over
the monument to the Unknown Sol
dier during the Berlin dress re
hearsal of his play and broken his
neck he might have had an oppor
tunity to prove himself adept at
more than cheap caricaturing. Ilis
play is representative of the occa
sional dip of Theatre Guilds into

ultra arty, ultra declamatory, ultra
poor fields. —J.S.S.
THE TYPHOON—At the Columbia
Theatre.
In spite of triumphs of past years,
in spite of the advertised super-cast
of three stars, "The Typhoon" is a
most disappointing play.
The story revolves around some
obscure mission of the flower of
Japanese intelligentsia in Berlin.
The most brilliant, played by Walker
Whiteside, is intrigued by Illona,
simpered by Florence Reed, and in
a moment of passion against her in
sults, strangles her. But Japan is a
united nation, and the diplomats
protect their genius until he finishes
his mission and can end his life
without serious loss to his Mikado.
Guy Bates Post, who appears as
Lindner, the poet, is the best of the
cast, but there is surprisingly little
reason for his part, unless it is to
create melodramatic excitement.
Melodrama is the main trouble with
the play, and with its old age, and
worn-out plot, there is little left in
its favor. ■—J.N.

THE TYPHOON—At the Columbia
Theatre.
In spite of triumphs of past years,
in spite of the advertised super-cast
of three stars, "The Typhoon" is a
most disappointing play.
The story revolves around some
obscure mission of the flower of
Japanese intelligentsia in Berlin.
The most brilliant, played by Walker
Whiteside, is intrigued by Illona,
simpered by Florence Reed, and in
a moment of passion against her in
sults, strangles her. But Japan is a
united nation, and the diplomats
protect their genius until he finishes
his mission and can end his life
without serious loss to his Mikado.
Guy Bates Post, who appears as
Lindner, the poet, is the best of the
cast, but there is surprisingly little
reason for his part, unless it is to
create melodramatic excitement.
Melodrama is the main trouble with
the play, and with its old age, and
worn-out plot, there is little left in
its favor. ■—J.N.
