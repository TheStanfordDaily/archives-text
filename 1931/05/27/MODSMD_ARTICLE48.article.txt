# NEW PAYMENT PLAN SUGGESTED BY JUDD
## 
### 
Since many students are short of
i funds at the end of the quarter, the
| Quad business staff has made ar
j rangements so that the annual may
I be ordered now and paid for later.
Those wishing Quads may post
I date checks as late the middle of
June,or an order may be sent in for
the book to be sent C.O.D. during
I the summer.
For those who have paid the $6
yearbooks will be distributed at 2
o'clock, June 3, from the Y.M.C.A.,
and as long after that as the supply
holds nut. Frank Adams, business
manager, is working on distribution
plans which will take care of the
I rush as quickly and efficiently as
possible.
