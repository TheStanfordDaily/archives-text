# MELLON WOULD WIDEN TAX-LIST
## Storm Of Criticism Heard From Senate Floor 
### 
| WASHINGTON, May 26. (JP) â€” '
, Secretary Mellon's proposal to in-
I crease the number of fedei'al tax
payers by broadening the tax struc
; ture aroused a storm of criticism
today from Senate independents and j
Democrats.
The intensity of feeling on this
subject at the Capitol indicated that !
| tax legislation will overshadow other
j issues in the next session of Con
i gress, no matter what course the ad
ministration decides to take to offset
j the expected $1,000,000,000 treasury
deficit.
Accepting Mellon's pi'oposal of
! broadening the income tax base as
j meaning a lowering of exemptions,
' Senator Borah of Idaho asserted: I
"The lowering of the exemptions
and the taxing of the smaller in
comes is on the same principle as
the lowering of wages. Both would
! have the effect of reducing still fur
i ther the purchasing power of the i
! great body of the people."
