NET RACKET
Australia or the Intercollegi
ates? That's the question con
fronting Stanford's Coast cham
pion tennis team. It's not a mat
ter of which the racket-swingers
would rather do (his summer,
but one which rests in the hands
of Australian amateur sports
promoters. All that remains is
the word "0.K." from across the
vast Pacific, and off goes the
team to treat the natives of the
island state to some high-class
tennis.

Should the trip materialize, inter
collegiate competition at Philadel
phia's Morion Cricket Club would
lose its strongest contender. How
ever, it's "to hell with the Intercol
lcgiates" when Australia is men
tioned us far as the boys are con
cerned. A chance to tour the little
continent on someone's else money
comes seldom. In fact, the last Card
inal net outfit to do it weni over in
1924.
Finances and a schedule for
the tour are details yet to be
completed by (lie Australians.
They shouldn't have much trou
ble putting it over, considering
the qualifications of the Red
shirts for representing Ameri
can college tennis. Just as Har
low Rothert did in track, these
netmen stand at the top of the
collegiate heap in tennis. And
plenty of sports-minded island
ers turned out to see Harlow
demonstrate the intricacies of
perfect shot-putting.
On the coast this year, Stanford
tennis was in a class by itself.
Leading the leaders was Keith Gled
hill, ranked as 14th in U.S. amateur
tennis. Gledhill won the national
junior title in 1929 after being run
ner-up in 1928. Last year he barely
missed becoming California's men's
singles champ when he lost a tough
finals battle to Chandler. This season
Gledhill won all his collegiate
matches, including the Coast Con
ference title encounter with the
Northwest's best man, Lloyd Noid
strom, of Washington, whom he
beat 6-4, 6-4.
Captain Ted Easton, second
ranking Indian, took George
Hoyt to the cleaners in the same
meet, completing the singles rout
of the Northerners. Teaming up,
the Cardinal pair whitewashed
the Huskies in straight sets, with
the loss of only two games. Five
other Stanford stars, kept from
the limelight only by the pres
ence of the two leaders, round
out the Redshirt six-man team
which cleaned up on Bruins,
Bears, and Trojans in record
breaking style.
Harry Plymire, Joe Coughlin,
Trow Stephens, Phil Niederauer,
Wilbur Cox—any one of these boys
might easily lead the average col
lege team. Below them on the Farm
ladder are some 15 aspirants whose
daily battles for ranking show a
brand of tennis which might lead
the casual observer to inquire, "Why
aren't those guys on the team?"

One week-end on the local
courts, Redskin net stars swept
18 matches out of 18 from Tro
jans and Bruins of parts South.
Only one match, that against a
Trojan, needed three sets for a
decision. A couple of weeks later
the Berkeley Bears came to
Stanford for a clean-sweep lick
ing, taking only one lousy set
during the process. That team,
people, deserves a trip to Aus
tralia. —Crawford.
