### 
DREAKERS spurted ahead yesterday to take the lead in the intramural
track meet from El Toro, doped to maintain its margin easily in the
shot an dthe low hurdles at the ohl oval. They raised their points to
22.457 well above Toro's 21,159. Sigma Nu with 18,156 took third place
from Theta Chi who follows wilh 14,891. In the last two events, the discus
and the half-mile, !>e run today at 2 o'clock, the winner of the cham
pionship will be decided. Individuals fighting toward the five medals
for personal store stand as follows: Woolley, Breakers 26!)!); Case, Phi Delt,

2581; Hay, Delta Chi, 2653 (former

in first place); Woodyatt, Delta Chi,
* 2550; and Clyne, Delta Upsilon, 2524.
With the scoring so close and the
other entrants pressing hard the
medals may go to anyone.
Dawson of Sigma Nu stepped to
| the front to heave the shot 42 feet
9 inches, which was one of the rea-
I sons his fraternity advanced in the
ranking. The 120 low hurdles re
! suited in a tie, when Gordon of
1 Breakers and Herbert, El Toro, both
chalked up a 13.5 time.
No tryouts for the eight-man relay
were held as were planned yester
| day, since not enough entrants ap
peared. All entries will run in the
tinals at the old oval tomorrow af
ternoon at 4 o'clock.
j With the discus and the 880 decid
ing the meet all groups are groom
ing their men to do better than their
best. Wright of El Toro and Ful
lenweider, Breakers, will fight for
the half-mile, but another man,
; Frank Young, may step in to take
first honors for himself.
What the discus throwers will do
is only guesswork. Colbin's 138 feet
chalked up in the meet last year
isn't even a gauge. Goldsmith just
} possibly may bring the points to
Breakers.
More than just the winning of this
meet is at stake between Toro and
Breakers. Since their points go to
I the all-season intramural trophy for
1 which both organizations are closely
j tied, every score means another step
! toward the big silver cup.
