CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 2G. (A 3 )
—The Master of Science degree to
be conferred upon Antonin Tulinov
here Thursday may consign him to

studies, Tulinov faces the necessity
of returning to Russia either volun

the death sentence is waiting.
'"All the efforts I've made to have
the government make an exception
of this case and give Tulinov a

j chance to become a citizen have
j failed," Dr. Veazey said.
Tulinov's death sentence was
! placed against him in the early days
of the Russian revolution. Bolshe
viks found him manufacturing ex
plosives and believed no trial was
1 necessary.
j "One night they rounded up lli of
I us," Tulinov said. "We were to be
j shot and left to die. Desperate, we
■ succeeded in taking the guns from
I some of our military escort. We
i started firing. In the excitement we
' escaped."
| After his escape, Tulinpv joined
I the White army of Czarist refugees,
i Then he went to Prague as a slu
■ dent. From Prague, he came to
! Cleveland on a student passport—
i the document that now is causing
! the trouble.
