# U. OF WASHINGTON EDITOR QUITS TO AVOID CENSORSHIP
## Faculty Check On Humor Magazine To Please High Schools 
### 
What he termed "unjust censor
ship" has caused Ralph Shaffer, edi
tor of "Columns," humor magazine
at the University of Washington, to
resign. His action is the result of a
clash with a representative of the
faculty publications committee over
several articles which were to ap
pear in a forthcoming issue of the
comic, which enjoys distribution
among high schools in the state of
Washington.

The faculty member had acted as
censor over the magazine since Jan
uary 30, after an editorial published
had brought much criticism, and
protests of this and previous issues
threatened suspension of the maga
zine. He has since kept a watchful
eye over all material to go into the
comic, and has power to delete all
"objectionable" copy.
Shaffer stated that he tried to edit
the magazine for Washington pri
marily, and not to cater to high
school students especially. "I feel
the issue is good enough as it is now
to appear on the campus. I would
rather resign than make over the
magazine to satisfy the censors,"
Shaffer said.
