PARIS, May 26 (if). â€”French and i
American leaders of Parisian soci- I
ety thronged a reproduction of !
Mount Vernon today as the Ameri- j
can pavilion at the French interna- '
tional colonial and overseas exposi- j
tion at Vincennes was officially i
opened.
American visitox-s found the home '
of George Washington faithfully re- |
produced, and a simmering heat,
rare for Paris, added to the illusion 1
of a Virginia atmosphere. Many
anachronisms were noticeable, in- j
eluding radio, motion pictures, a red
skins' band, and ice water, but these
did not make Mount Vernon any
less American.
American Ambassador Walter E.
Edge emphasized America's avoid
ance of imperial expansion. "Al- j
though not a colonial power in the
accepted sense of the word," he said,
"my country, because of its colo
nial orign, presents to mankind a
concrete example of the full flower
ing of intelligent and successful ov
erseas -development."
