### Michael Crofoot 
Stanford's track team is in Phila-
Jelphia this morning, last of the Far
Western horde to arrive at Franklin
Field, scene of the 1.C.4-A. meet to
norrow and Saturday.
Today Dink Templeton will put
lis stars through a geritle workout
o unlimber the "train legs" which
lis athletes may have acquired since
heir departure from Palo Alto.
U.S.C. Favored
The University of Southern Cali
ornia, defending champion and the
mly collegiate team with the Indian
ign on Stanford for the last two
ears, arrived in Philadelphia, twen
y-one strong, yesterday. They are
leavily favored to go West again
vith the title of intercollegiate
hamplons.
It will be the greatest of upsets
f the Cards should come through to
utscore Troy. Pre-meet dope, com
liled from individual performances
uring the season, indicates that the
'rojans will win in a walk and that
Stanford will have a difficult time
a taking second place away from
'ennsylvania.
Indians Not in Shape
Salient reasons for considering the
ndians out of the running are first
hat U.S.C. has a very fine team,
econd, that several Indian athletes
re not in the peak of condition, and
liird, Stanford's strength this year
> on the track.
During the last decade Stanford
trength on the track in the West
as invariably proved to be Stanford
weakness on the track in the East.
»ud Spencer (47.7), our greatest
uarter-miler till Eastman started
i, couldn't win an 1.C.4-A. title;
ohnny Morrison (48.6) failed to
'in a place in three separate at
;mpts.
West Crippled
Three of Dink's stars will be colli
ding with game legs. Arne West,
citing with game legs. Arnie West,
toad jump, is one of them, and he
ill be jumping against such men
; U.S.C.'s Barber (24'11"), Pennsyl
inia's Boyle (24'8"), and Dart
outh's Donner (24'3").
Hec Dyer is another man with a
•cently pulled muscle, and all he
is to go up against is the Trojan,
'ykolT (9.4), and Eddie Tolan of
ichigan (9.5).
Captain Podge Smith, with his un
•rtain leg, has to face such men
Record of Harvard (14.8) and
evoe of Yale (15 flat).
Cards Have Chance
But if everything breaks for us
id nothing for U.S.C., Stanford can
turn with their fourth intercolie
ate championship. It is possible
at our cripples will be at top
rm, that several recent practice
•rformances of West (6'3") in the
«h jump, and Ray (195') in the
velin, be turned into account, that
o sure point-winners, Dyer, East
tn, Smith, Gray, and Jones, take
sts; that the pretty sure point
tters, such as Laborde, Grey, Abe
ibles, Nisbet, and McCleod, take
ints, and that the doubtful point
tters, such as Ike Hables, A1 Ray,
nie West, Wallie Butler, Jack
ugman, Bob Brown, and Bert De
oot come through.

Hec Dyer is another man with a

is to go up against is the Trojan,

But if everything breaks for us

velin, be turned into account, that
o sure point-winners, Dyer, East
tn, Smith, Gray, and Jones, take

Stanford's track team is in Phila-
Jelphia this morning, last of the Far
Western horde to arrive at Franklin
Field, scene of the 1.C.4-A. meet to
norrow and Saturday.
Today Dink Templeton will put
lis stars through a geritle workout
o unlimber the "train legs" which
lis athletes may have acquired since
heir departure from Palo Alto.
U.S.C. Favored
The University of Southern Cali
ornia, defending champion and the
mly collegiate team with the Indian
ign on Stanford for the last two
ears, arrived in Philadelphia, twen
y-one strong, yesterday. They are
leavily favored to go West again
vith the title of intercollegiate
hamplons.
It will be the greatest of upsets
f the Cards should come through to
utscore Troy. Pre-meet dope, com
liled from individual performances
uring the season, indicates that the
'rojans will win in a walk and that
Stanford will have a difficult time
a taking second place away from
'ennsylvania.
