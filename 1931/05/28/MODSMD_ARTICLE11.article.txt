# QUAD APPOINTS JUNIOR EDITORS
## Hansen, Eisner, Weller To Build '32 Yearbook 
### 
Raymond Hansen, Helen Eisner, j
and Morris Weller yesterday were j
' appointed to the position of junior |
editors to serve on the 1932 Quad |
j From these three the editor for 1933 |
! will be chosen.
Each junior will fill three posi- I
; tions next year, office manager, il-
I lustration editor, and copy editor, j
and by his success in these posts I
his qualifications for editor will be I
judged. Anne Burnett, women's edi
tor, serves as office manager also, |
; with the same rank as the junior
i editors, cxcept that her position con-
I tinues all year.
Time spent in the office and effi
] ciency in their work are the stand
| ards for the sophomore members of
) the staff working for assistant edi
torships. The juniors' success de- |
pends only on the ability shown in
the three positions they fill while
the Quad is being prepared.
Customarily one of the junior po- '
j sitions goes to a woman, who has '
I equal chances with the men for the
; editorship. This assures at least one
; woman a place in the junior ap
! pointments and sometimes two may
! be appointed.
j The last meeting of the Quad edi
torial tryoutees will be held tonight
| in Room 6 of the Press Building for
| the freshmen and sophomores and
:â€¢ the three junior appointees. Tom
i Aitken, next year's editor, will out
l line plans for the 1932 book, and
give the staff members an idea of
I their work.
