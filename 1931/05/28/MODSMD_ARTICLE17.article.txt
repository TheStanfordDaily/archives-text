# Modern Queen Elizabeth Stars In Domestic Life
## 
### BETTY HEWIT 
A domestic Queen Elizabeth, of
all things, when the memory of this
I loud-voiced, dynamic person on the
: stage had so carefully warned the
| reporter to throw in her hat first.
. and tcJl the management
not to allow any more dirty cars to
I park in front. That grease on my
skirt is terrible!" and a terrified
! bell hop backed out of the door. A
big voice for a tiny creature seated
j on the floor of her apartment dili
gently cutting bias strips for the
new pajamas which she wants to
wear picnicing Sunday.
"That's just my Queen Elizabeth
voice," she laughed softly and went
oil talking in her usual low distinct
i tones.
For the first time in her career
Miss Frederick can say that she has
a favorite role and that is her prc.s-
I ent part. "Queen Elizabeth is the

' first play in which she has portrayed
the character of someone who has
really existed. Although the make
up is heavy and the costumes un
comfortable, some of the dresses
weighing more than 40 pounds, Miss
I Frederick is fascinated by the in
} terpretation and much prefers it to
fictitious portrayals.
Gordon Davis, former dramatic di
rector at Stanford, directed her last
play and had planned to play the
part of Sir Robert Cecil in her pres
ent vehicle. Motion picture direc
tion. however, kept him in Holly
wood.
Miss Frederick's relaxation be
tween performances ranges from
! golf to washing dishes at a friend's
house, plus experiments in baking
strawberry shortcake, at which she
has attained rare success.
Time to go, and the departure of a
j reporter beaming, "Whatta Woman!''
