## Dean Mary Yost Favors Second Trial Year For 2:30 Leaves; Conference Report Passes With No Exceptions; Freshmen Limited 
### 
j EXTENSION of mid-week lockouts from 11:30 o'clock to midnight and
limitation of 2:30 o'clock mid-week leaves for freshman and first-quar
: ter lower-division women to three a quarter were unqualifiedly approved
yesterday by Acting-President Robert E. Swain. These changes in the
women's regulations were recommended at a meeting of Women's Con
j ference Friday and will go into effect at the start of the 1931-32 year in
October. The ratio of three mid-week leaves for freshman and first
quarter lower-division women and eight for other undergraduate women
will remain unchanged; fhe extension of a half-hour being effected mainly

• to allow women to see second shows
in Palo Alto and San Jose without
risking a lockout.
Limitation of mid-week 2:30
leaves for freshman and first-quar
ter lower-division women carries
the additional provision that only
one of the three leaves may be used
in one week. They will not be al
lowed more than two 2:30 o'clock
leaves in one week including a
week-end leave.
All other women, under the new
system, will be allowed not more
than three 2:30 o'clock leaves a
week, only one of which may be a
mid-week leave. Furthermore, a
mid-week overnight leave for cul
tural or social purposes will be con
sidered as the mid-week 2:30 o'clock
leave.
Permission Not Needed
j Women will not need to ask per
mission for 2:30 o'clock leaves rext
year. Special leaves may be granted
only by the president of the Asso
ciated Women Students, or, in case
of her absence, by any other mem
ber of A.W.S. Council.
One other change will take place
I in the women's regulations—the ad
j dition of a set of by-laws, the most
j important of which prohibits dupli
; cation of women participating in the
! offices of any member of the A.W.S.
; Council, W.A.A. president, Y.W.C.A.
i president, member of the Daily Edi
j torial Board, and general business
! manager of the Quad, Daily, and

into effect with the Class of 1933.
Election Change
Other by-laws going into effect in
October are the choosing of women
j less active in student affairs for
j minor offices, the sanction of a for
' mal organization among the women
of each class to be developed in
such form as the individual class
directs, and the necessity to secure
! the approval from prospective wom
j en candidates for student offices be
i fore formal nomination be made.

I "every change seems to be one for
