# EX COMMITTEE REVOKES POLO SQUAD BLOCKS
## Approval Granted To 1932 Budget Submitted By Manager Milne NAME TRACK MANAGER Nine Picked To Constitute Rally Committee 
### 
Dispute over the awarding of
block "S" letters to members of the
water polo team who won the Jun
ior National A.A.U. Championship
was definitely settled last night by
the Executive Committee when that
j body rescinded its motion of last
week granting the letters to the
j team.
The letters were not granted due
to a decision of Professor A. M.
Cathcart, Acting Dean of the Law
School, on the constitutionality of
the matter. Cathcart ruled that a
Senior National A.A.U. Champion
ship would be necessary before
block awards could be made.
The A.S.S.U. budget for the com
ing year, which was presented by
Stan Milne, student manager, was
accepted by the Committee. The
budget will be the same as last
; year's except for the appropriation
| to retire the Basketball Pavilion note
: and the sum set aside for the
I Pavilion heating system.
