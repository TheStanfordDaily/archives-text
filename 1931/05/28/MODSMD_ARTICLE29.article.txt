# INEQUALITIES IN THE BUDGET
## 
### 
There are two very interesting volumes published by
the University eaeh year. One is the Annual Report of the
President. The other is the Annual Kegister, which is a
combination of information booklets, bawlouts, and an
nouncements of courses.
In the president's report are contained, not only depart
mental reports and a mass of miscellaneous material, but
some rather revealing figures concerning the budgeting
of the*l Diversify funds. In tiie register are printed, among
other things, the number of students enrolled in every
Stanford class each quarter.
If studied together, the figures on department class en
rollments and the department budgets present what appear
to be great inequalities in the distribution of Stanford
moneys. One department, with only 17 major students, re
ceived approximately for the year ended August .'U,
1!);{(). Another department, with 10 majors, received more
than $33,000 for the year. On the other hand, a depart
ment with nearly (>OO majors, received only $(>0,3-J3.f>l for
the same period, less than twice the amount budgeted to
the other departments with their tiny comparative enroll
ments.
All departments serve more students than their respec
tive majors, but generally the departments with the large
enrollments of majors are also the principal "service" de
partments for other units of the University.
There is no question that all students cannot be edu
cated at the same cost, or at anywhere near the same cost.
It is impossible even to consider all the factors involved
in the training of a student for a particular field. Many
courses for which but few students register are essential
in equipping an individual for a special pursuit or in giv
ing him a "general" education.
Hut there is also no question that the teaching burden
at Stanford is far heavier on some departments than on
others. Faculty members are unanimous in agreeing that
any subject can be taught more satisfactorily to small
groups than to large.
There is undoubtedly inequality in the distribution of
University funds for leaching and research, and it is the
students who suffer from mass production education.
Equality in the budget would be impossible of attainment,
and it would not be desirable. But a more equitable situa
tion could exist here, and it should exist.
The departments that carry the heaviest teaching bur
dens deserve to be adequately taken care of lirst.
