# JUST A LITTLE RIDICULOUS
## 
### 
With a short-sightedness that would ho uproarious if
il wore not so downright idiotic, an organization known as
the city of Palo Alto's Board of Censors has seen fit to bar
the showing of a moving-picture, "Young Sinners," because
of certain "immoral" sequences. Those sequences were
objectionable in the eyes of the board, because in them,
youths and girls were shown drinking and carousing.
Just what the board thinks il has gained in barring this
movie, which reviews stamp as only ordinary, is a trifle
vague. It has, of course, removed the immoral influence
from llu> fair city of Palo Alto, but il has not been moved
very far, inasmuch as the picture is now showing at Red
wood City. Furthermore, our memories of the sjagc ver
sion of the afl'air recall that the ending was very tritely
moral. At all events, those members of the younger gen
eration who in for "hell-raising" of the kind depicted in
"Young Sinners" undoubtedly know all about it without
being shown pictures of it, and those who don't go in for
il won't learn much from the movie. The board's motives
were no doubt excellent; their execution, ridiculous.
