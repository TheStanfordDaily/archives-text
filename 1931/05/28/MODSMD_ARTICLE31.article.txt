# MAKING THE STUDENTS PAY
## 
### 
What the Governor of North (Carolina said to the Gov
ernor of South Carolina is common knowledge, hut it
would he interesting to know just what students at the
rniversitv of North Carolina are saying to and about the
members of the psychology department at that school. It
seems that the psychology department decided the stu
dents were missing too many classes, so it initiated a move
ment by which unexcused absences from class are punish
able by a fine ol' one dollar, excused absences by a fine of
fifty cents, uncxcuiscd absences from examinations bv a
fine of two dollars and excused absences from examina
tions by a fine of one dollar.
One thing is fairly certain a few psychologists need
their heads examined. If the lectures in the North Carolina
psychology department are so very interesting or so very
valuable, then the loss of pleasure or the information
missed by the student who cuts is punishment enough. If
the lectures aren't interesting or valuable, then why should
the poor undergraduate pay? And even if they are, it is
conceivable that a man might occasionally be forced to use
his class time elsewhere something that he ought to be
able to do free of charge.
