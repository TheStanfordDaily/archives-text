## UNFAIR PROPAGANDA BEING SPREAD 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What reasons are there, now, for
opposing the World Court, which is,
as Hearst says, more properly called
the League Court because of the
fact that it is an integral part of the
League and supported by it? Mr.
Rowell himself furnishes the an
swer. He said in a recent article that
the real reason for opposing the
Court is that its opponents feel ihut
membership on the ,Court will be
but the first step to entering the
League. He added that the peopie
of the United States, having tested
the forbidden fruit and found it not
poisonous, would then think better
of its parent, the League. Mr. Rowell
never saw the problem clearcr.
Membership on the Court, in itself
not so dangerous as Hearst would
make us* believe, is but the first step
planned by the great body of ideal
istic pacifists and internationalists
toward getting the United States in
the League.
But what is the need for the
Court? I have never seen a satis
factory explanation. Arbitration has
settled many important international
problems and, I think, is a far better
way to settle peacefully difficulties
between nations than the World
Court. Mr. Rowell suggested recent
ly that only the Court could prop
erly settle the present difficulty be
tween France and Germany over the
proposed (Austro-German customs
treaty and that arbitration could not
do it, but I disagree with him.
Most of the advocates of the
League are silent now and are
working diligently to get the United
States in the Court first. However,
Ihere is a great deal of subtle and
really unfair propaganda being
spread, especially in the schools and
universities, that is designed to in
flueiice the developing minds of the
future leaders of America toward a
favorable attitude to the League of
Nations. I have yet to see a teacher
or professor who is opposed to the
League. There are no doubt a few,
but I have never heard cf them.
Courses are given, as at Stanford,
on the League, and there are nu
merous contests held the
country with prizes offered for the
best essays on the League. Not a
word is said against the League or
Court. There are always two sides
to a question, but here the other
side is absolutely ignored. This is
what I call unfair and contrary to
American practice. Why has no one
noticed this insidious, subtle propa
ganda spread among the school
chilch-en of America? I do NOT ob
ject to courses on the League and
contests on the subject of the
League in themselves, but I do ob
ject to the fact that scarcely any
where is there a statement made in
the schools and universities that
presents the other side of the ques
tion.
I am sorry that I have had to con
dense this subject so much: I hope,
however, that you will be so kind as
to publish this letter IN ITS EN
TIRETY, as it is about time that the
students at this University were pre
sented with some facts on this con
troversial and highly important is
sue. Yours very truly,

settled many important international
problems and, I think, is a far better
way to settle peacefully difficulties
between nations than the World
Court. Mr. Rowell suggested recent
ly that only the Court could prop
erly settle the present difficulty be
tween France and Germany over the
proposed (Austro-German customs
treaty and that arbitration could not
do it, but I disagree with him.
Most of the advocates of the
League are silent now and are
working diligently to get the United
States in the Court first. However,
Ihere is a great deal of subtle and
really unfair propaganda being
spread, especially in the schools and
universities, that is designed to in
flueiice the developing minds of the
future leaders of America toward a
favorable attitude to the League of
Nations. I have yet to see a teacher
or professor who is opposed to the
League. There are no doubt a few,
but I have never heard cf them.
Courses are given, as at Stanford,
on the League, and there are nu
merous contests held the
country with prizes offered for the
best essays on the League. Not a
word is said against the League or
Court. There are always two sides
to a question, but here the other
side is absolutely ignored. This is
what I call unfair and contrary to
American practice. Why has no one
noticed this insidious, subtle propa
ganda spread among the school
chilch-en of America? I do NOT ob
ject to courses on the League and
contests on the subject of the
League in themselves, but I do ob
ject to the fact that scarcely any
where is there a statement made in
the schools and universities that
presents the other side of the ques
tion.
I am sorry that I have had to con
dense this subject so much: I hope,
however, that you will be so kind as
to publish this letter IN ITS EN
TIRETY, as it is about time that the
students at this University were pre
sented with some facts on this con
troversial and highly important is
sue. Yours very truly,

The Editor, Sir:
What reasons are there, now, for
opposing the World Court, which is,
as Hearst says, more properly called
the League Court because of the
fact that it is an integral part of the
League and supported by it? Mr.
Rowell himself furnishes the an
swer. He said in a recent article that
the real reason for opposing the
Court is that its opponents feel ihut
membership on the ,Court will be
but the first step to entering the
League. He added that the peopie
of the United States, having tested
the forbidden fruit and found it not
poisonous, would then think better
of its parent, the League. Mr. Rowell
never saw the problem clearcr.
Membership on the Court, in itself
not so dangerous as Hearst would
make us* believe, is but the first step
planned by the great body of ideal
istic pacifists and internationalists
toward getting the United States in
the League.
But what is the need for the
Court? I have never seen a satis
factory explanation. Arbitration has
settled many important international
problems and, I think, is a far better
way to settle peacefully difficulties
between nations than the World
Court. Mr. Rowell suggested recent
ly that only the Court could prop
erly settle the present difficulty be
