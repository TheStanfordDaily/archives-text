In "The Stability of Truth" I en
deavored to show that all knowledge
results from human experience test
ed and set in order, that science can
never be more than relatively com
plete, but that as far as it goes it
deals with absolute truth, and its
final test must be this, "Can we
trust our lives to it, or to its meth
ods?"
As a biologist I take issue also
with the (later) dictum of Balfour,
that life is "merely a disreputable
•episode in the history of one of the
minor planets." Rather is it the be
ginning of a glorious triumph of in
telligence and devotion—on a "minor
planet," to be sure, but in a Uni
verse which knows no great or
small.
