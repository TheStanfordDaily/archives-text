What's to be done with this thing
called Men's Council, unless they ,
initiate a lot of the campus' unused I
millionaires into their organization? ]
Two more of our little fleece-less ;
Hock have been informed that they
won't be missed if they go home '
and s?tay there for a long, long time. ■
The honor idea is very fine—
hut who's going to foot the bills
at this institution of free educa
tion, if the hank rolls are scat
home, stamped "Imperfect—re
lumed for factory improve
ment"?
Cabbages breaks down and con
fesses—we've borrowed at leaat .
fourteen words from Webster, this
year—and we won't pay more than :
$114 for the daily coffee and dough- i
nuts, either.

The good old Daily, being the i
center from which all truth and !
goodness is spread throughout the
Indian territory, has received an.in
teresting communication from some
where—as nearly as we can dope it ,
out, the young women's purity
league of America, or something j
equally impractical.
They want us to suggest a
working plan of action to some
of our little followers; and we
always do what we're asked to
do. Here goes (in part):
"If you do not know a young
man's record, have your father or
brother look it up for you.
"Many young men will call whose ,
habits and character are such thnt
you cannot associate with them
without injuring your own social :
standing.
"Assure them that you will
gladly assist them to reform . . .
(Ho hum!!!)
"If all young, respectable girls
would be frank in disapproving of
the filthy, expensive, and poisonous
weed . .
Well, cigarette sales go down—
and will we or will we not install
bright lights in the parlors of our '
sorority houses? And the good old
dating bureau system? When in |
search of a blind date, go to Paly, j
young man, or South, or something j
—at any rate, go!
