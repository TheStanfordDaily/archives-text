# BULL SESSION
## THROUGH "IVY-COVERED" ARCHES 
### 
Very shortly now, the organ will ]
give forth deep and sonorous tones,
and, with measured tread, the Class ,
I of 1931 will pass through the ivy- j
j covered arches (metaphorically i
| speaking)—into the great game j
) called "Life"—Life with a capital
j "L." Soon they will all be holding j
i jobs (we hope), and then they will
J cease to be parts of the younger j
j generation; they will cease to be j
i classed with their more leisure-lov- !
I ing companions still within the |
1 sacred halls of learning.
There are only a few months aging I
j after graduation and the.graduate is j
no longer recognizable—intellectu
i ally, psychologically, and other ways
too. Campus socialists become well
meaning Democrats and Republicans
' —they forget about justice and such
vague terms. Campus Casanovas be- j
come quiet family men. Keg-drain- J
j ers join the Anti-Saloon League and
preach the wonders of prohibition
up and down the state. The students
! forsake The Nation and New Re
public for the Literary Digest; they
; give up Vanity Fair and the New
Yorker for the Sunday supplement.
In short, they merge right in with
! the thousands of other babbits that :
| crowd the nation.
What causes this great change? j
I What causes the students to give up J
j the culture and ideals of the cam- I
| pus for the philistine virtues of the I

J world? In the first place, the mone- .
j <ary pressure probably plays a de- '
cided part. In the world of business, j
' the free-thinking, liberal-minded I
| individual is the object of adoration,
j The graduate does not have to look
J far, unfortunately, to see the big 1
I tycoons of finance and industry J
j laughing at labor and its problems;
grabbing where the grabbing is j
j good; and rushing ahead by the j
j easiest rqad. The young graduate is
1 ioo often swept off his feet; and in- ;
j stead of holding to that which he
j feels to be right, follows the lack
' of ideals that characterize some but
not all of his successful elders.
The idealists of the Class of 1931 —
its members who with voice and pen
have often rallied to the side of lib
eral causes will probably prove no <
j exception to the rule, by and large. I
| It sounds hopeless to speak in such
I a vein; but experience bears out the
| contention. Progress must come—for i
nobody but a few standpatters feel
that the acme of perfection has been
already reached—and if it is to be
realized, the college graduates must j
do it. It may sound like a high
school valedictory address to say j
that the "Class of 1931" must do •
; something to show their college ,
| idealism and culture—but if Amer
! ica is ever to reach a "Golden Age" j
J that consists of more than gold, this i
! must take place.
