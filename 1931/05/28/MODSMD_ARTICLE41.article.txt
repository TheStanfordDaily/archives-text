YOUNG SINNERS—NOT at the
New Stanford Theatre.
Yesterday we surprisingly noted
j that Palo Alto's obscure censor
' board had banned a certain unno
torious moving picture named
| "Young Sinners."
Thereafter we gleefully telephoned
theatres, editors, libraries, and cen
-1 sors to discover the status of Palo
i Alto morals and Ihe picture indus
! try.
One gentleman militantly re
marked that part of the picture was
! excellent, but that it contained cer-
I tain uncuttable earlier scenes in
which wild kids drank, raised hell.
We did not ask this gentleman about
use of obscene language in pictures,
i Two pleasant female Board mem
bers assured us that the decision
had not been unanimous by any
means; one of them suggested, in
fact, that the picture should be j
shown to parents, that they might j
| be acquainted with the state of af- 1
j fairs.
An executive member of the i
! Board, whom we succeeded in cap- j

Turing only after six others had been |
questioned, gallantly and very j
democratically refused to give us |
any details, saying that the com
mittee's meetings were secret, their
decisions the important thing.
Ho hum, youngsters, if you want
to see the uselessly banned, not very
clever celluloid, dash down to Red
wood and learn how it's done. These
sinners will, I'm afraid, be discour- j
aging. They're only outwardly bad;
every one of them has a heart pure
as the blooming lily. —J.S.S.
KICK IN—At the New Stanford
Since the Palo Alto Censor Board
in its infinite wisdom decided that
the previously announced feature
film, "Young Sinners," should not j
be allowed to taint the morals of j
the youth of the town, the New
Stanford chose the "IT" girl's latest
vehicle.
The plot is that familiar one of
the difficulties an ex-con meets in
his attempt to go straight, and al
though it. drags frequently, it is not I
bad entertainment. —S.C.A. j
