GRIDIRON IN SPRING
Spring practice for the grid
on sport has come in for a lot
f argument recently, hut Pop
Earner and his hoys are not
asling words during these pre
ious, warm May months. ,
hey're saving all their wind
>r good, tough work, a product
Inch builds winners. And af
-■r sweating under the heavy
>otl>all togs three days a week
>r more than a month, the pig
tin packers are getting a chance
ii show off what they've ac- j
omplishcd during (lie spring
ession.

'omorrow afternoon soon after 4
ock, Warner's stalwarts will put
a regular contest. Officials, yard
•ks, timekeepers, water boys, and
the remaining paraphernalia that
aeks of real competition will bo in
dence. The quarters v/ill be some
at shortened, since the players
• not yet in good enough physical
idition to go the full route. And j
er the final gun, Redskins will |
iert the gridiron until September j
h.
You'll see the hoys line up in j
•egular "C"' formation, running
hrough the play as they did last j
/car for two or three successive :
iines. Then you'll see them line
lp in "C" formation, the quar
er will bawl out some signals,
>ut the hall will remain in the j
•enter's hands while a couple of
inemen SHIFT, putting the team j
n "A" formation before the pig
skin is snapped. Yes, it can no i
longer be denied. Pop is going
lo use the "shift" next season.

Warner experimented with his
ecial type of line shift last year,
idently finding it very satisfac
ry. One thing it does to men not
ed to playing against it is to throw j
em all a mile off-sides. Elevens i
lich have met Stanford teams in j
e past will expect play to start I
hen the players begin to move. If |
ey do, it's likely to cost them live ;
uds a throw until they learn to i
.lit. And if they learn to wait, j
>p's linemen will get the jump on i
em every time.
. ..
We remember the practice j
session last year when Warner
was caught testing this play. As
we watched the scrimmage, we
noticed a tackle running from
one side of the line to the other . j
before the bail was snapped, a
moreover which too closely re
sembled a shift to be used in an j
orthodox Warner eleven. Seeing
the process repeated several
times convinced us that it could
not be a dream, so we appealed
to Don E. Liebendorfer, who is
usually "in the kndw" to sports
goins on around here. Don in- |
formed us that we were crazy,
that a tackle had simply lined up
in the wrong place and was
hurrying to rectify the,mistake
before the ball came back.
<♦> <§>
That was our cue to keep the j
•hole business in the dark as far i
s the press was concerned. But that j
ight somebody spilled the beans to i
n Oakland paper, which phoned
Varner for verification, saying they I
/ould print the story whether or '
ot he denied its truth. So Pop broke j
own and let it all out, not without 1
lointing out a few undesirable char- j
cteristics of newspaper reporters, |
lovvever. After the incident, Warner
Iropped the bars of the practice field ,

I on all scribes, and the barn door was
s'hut after the horse had been stolen.
