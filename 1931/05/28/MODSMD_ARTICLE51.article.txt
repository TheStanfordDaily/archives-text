With 105 entries in the seven
events, Stanford's 12th Annual
Horse Show, sponsoi'ed by the mili
tary department, which will be held
tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock in
the riding enclosure next to the
Encina polo field, promises to give
plenty of thrills and exhibitions of
horsemanship to campus fanciers of
King Horse.
The most spectacular of ,the seven
events will be the jumping contests,
which will be military, touch and
out, and pair, jumping. In the mili
tary jumping the course will be
twice around four three-foot jumps,
performance only to count; the
height of the jumps will be in
creased above three feet as the
number of contestants narrows
down.
Touch and out jumping will have
a course similar to that of military
jumping, and jumps will likewise be
raised; in this event competitors
will be eliminated as their mounts
touch the jump or refuse to take it.
The course for paired jumping wiU
consist of four three-foot jumps; in
this event the manner in which the
horses of a pair negotiate the course
together and the ability of the riders
to jump their horses side by side
will be judged as well as the other
factors.
Polo fans will have an opportunity
to see the campus poloists and polo
ponies in action in the polo stake
race, which consists of racing to a
pair of stakes, making a figure eight
around them, and then returning to
the starting point, all against time.
Horsemen are expected to bite the
dust and laughs will be frequent in
the mounted musical chair event,
which, when played on horseback, is
no parlor game.
