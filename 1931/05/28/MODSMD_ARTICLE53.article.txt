# FRESHMAN WOMEN LOSE CLOSE SWIM MEET TO JUNIORS
## Third Year Class Takes Four Of Six Firsts; Leading Series 
### 
Taking four out of a possible six
first places and winning the relay,
the junior women defeated the
freshmen 35 l /2-30V-> in a closely
fought meet yesterday afternoon in
the women's pbol.
Although the placings indicate
otherwise, each race was keenly
contested, and, up to the last two
events, the score was nip and tuck
with scarcely more than one point's
difference between the teams. Out
standing among the events was the
plunge in which Betty Ann Kelly
bro√üe last year's record by almost
two feet with a plunge of 49 feet.
The juniors are now leading the
series, having one win and one de
fault chalked up for them. The
sophomores will meet the seniors
tomorrow afternoon at 4:20 o'clock
in the women's pool.
