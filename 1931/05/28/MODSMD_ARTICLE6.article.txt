# UNITY SEEN AS BRIAND DECIDES TO RETAIN JOB
## Resignation Withdrawn On Demand Of Premier Pierre Laval 
### 
PARIS, May 27. (/P)—Foreign
Minister Aristide Briand withdrew
his resignation at the meeting of the
Council of Ministers today and said
he would remain in the French cabi
net.
M. Briand made his decision only
after the urgent demands of Pre
mier Pierre Laval and his fellow
ministers. The meeting lasted nearly
three hours during which the For
eign Minister explained the results
of his work at the meetings of the
League Council and the Pan-Euro
pean Commission in Geneva.
PARIS, May 27. (/P) —Aristide
Briand, having announced his wil
lingness to remain in charge of
France's foreign relations, political
leaders were busy tonight trying to
stifle hostility.
Finance as a whole seemed im
pressed with the necessity of a real
national unity, because of the many
international problems on the hori
zon and the big disarmament con
ference scheduled to open at Geneva
early next year, all possessing vital
interests for France.
French opinion still regards rela
tions with Germany as the outstand
ing question of foreign policy, and
even tonight, while M. Briand was
benig showered with congratulations
on his decision, to remain in office,
press dispatches indicated Germany
may ask at least a moratorium on
war reparations. Frenchmen re
ceived this as an indication economic
and financial problems are likely to
arise to complicate the entire Euro
pean political situation.
Warning that M. Briand's old time
; enemies in the Chamber of Deputies
will continue their battle against his
policy was given by the announce
(ment of Deputy Franklin Bouillon
that he would interpellate the gov
-1 ernment when the chamber recon
venes tomorrow. He said he would
i demand that M. Briand be replaced
on the ground that his course of
action in meetings of the League of
Nations and elsewhere constitutes a
menace to national unity.
