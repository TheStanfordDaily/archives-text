# Independent Studying Lauded By Graduates
## 
### 
In the remaining period before the
end of the quarter, Professor Edgar
1 E. Robinson, chairman of the com
mittee on the independent study
' plan, is interviewing students who
arc considering registering next
summer or autumn quarters for
: work under this plan, which is open
to upper-division students with av
erages of B or better. Sophomores
who will be juniors after this q'uar
-1 ter arc particularly invited to con
fer with Professor Robinson, whose
office is 172 Administration Build
-1 ing.
In order to learn the attitude of
i students who have had experience
with the independent study plan, a
Daily reporter interviewed several
graduate students who worked uri
i dcr the plan and several of the stu
dents at present studying under this
i arrangement.
Every one of the students inter
viewed was enthusiastic about the
advantages of the independent study
plan, and agreed upon some of the

more specific advantages, more or
, less as follows: The plan gives an
i opportunity for following intensely
j one particular field of interests, with
continuity of thought and study;
| it gives hours of study unbroken by
! the frequent interruptions of class
| schedules; it enables a student to as
j sert his independence and individu
| laity in his work; it aids in develop
| ing initiative, resourcefulness, and
j persistence.
One student compared indepen
i dent study to class work as he would
j compare a speedboat and horse jog
ging slowly along the beaten path.
Especially interesting was the
comment of Margaret Ball, now a
graduate student in political science.
She said: "I had a grand time last
summer, working in absentia—brief
ing international law cases in a
bathing suit, feet on a card table
set up in a shaded patio at my home
in Santa Monica—pounds and
pounds of my law on my lap, ciga
rette in hand, ashes on the floor."
