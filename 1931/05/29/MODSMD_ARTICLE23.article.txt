# EX-EDITOR

### 
WoII, Dick, today I have my last chance lo fill Ihe edit
column. Do you remember it takes (>i) typewritten lines of
I lie stufr nohod v ever admits reading to till the space be
neath The Daily masthead?" You'll be pounding out those
(19 lines for each of the 70 issues of Volume <SO. And some
days you're going lo be wondering, Why the hell?
You'll be writing about a lot of things. It'll take some
210 editorials for those 70 issues. You'll be writing about
the Honor ('ode probably. The Code looks as if it is going
to bo given a chance to prove its worth. The Men's and
Women's Councils are taking their jobs seriously and are
both committed to policies of strict enforcement. Per
haps, in a few years a sentiment will have developed
among Ihe Associated Students so that no one will want to
violate any of Ihe provisions of the Honor Code.
Then there's the student health service here. You may
be talking about that. Every student pays $5 a quarter for
health insurance. In return, he receives a certain amount
of hospitalization in case of severe illness or injury and
inadequate care otherwise. A 21-hour-a-dav health service
for every student is not too much lo ask in return for the
-Yl") each student pays a year.
The junior colleges, too, are apt lo cause a little com
ment. You know they haven't yet proved to be an adequate
substitute for the first two university years. I'ntil thev do
prove such a substitute Stanford will be foolish not to
tighten up its entrance requirements for junior college
transfers and even to think about abolishing the lower
division. As you may recall, the junior colleges are still
just two more years of high school.
The women are here, Dick, live hundred of them. He
careful what you say about them. Cuss the men out all
you like, but be cautious about telling-Ihe women anything.
There are a lot of other topics you'll editorialize on.
Some people may like what you say; many of them won't.
You're apt to be called a megalomaniac. Maybe you'll be
told you're mean and low and vicious and gullible and
malicious. Someone mav even accuse you of having a
turnip's soul.
Hut you're going lo have a grand lime, Dick. The Daily
isn't such a bad sheet, and occasionally il does something
somebody likes.
This has gone about far enough. Cood luck lo you,
Dick, and do as you please.
