In jusl a little more than two weeks the Glass of '31 will
have placed its bronze plate in the Inner Quad, been grad
uated, and joined the many elasses that have preceded it
into Stanford's alumni ranks.
A memorable Senior Week has been planned for this
year's graduates, beginning with the alumni banquet and
promenade on June 10 and ending with the commencement
exercises five days later. For the 755) undergraduates who
will receive their A.li.'s next month, this week, crowded
as it is with events of unusual interest, should be signifi
cant. It will be both a summing up and conclusion of their
four undergraduate years and a bright and prophetic com
mencement of the years that await them as alumni.
The ID.'U Senior Week will not be soon forgotten.
