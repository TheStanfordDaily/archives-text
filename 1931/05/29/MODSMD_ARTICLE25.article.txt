# BETTER CO-OPERATE
## 
### 
The Hoard of Athletic Control's new plan for. the allot
ting of football tickets is apparently not working so well
for the students, if the number of student applications sent
in so far is any indication.
l r nder the new system, student and alumni applications
will be mailed out some time in July, but tirst it is neces
sary that the students leave their addresses at the Ii.A.C.
to insure their getting applications, t'p to yesterday, only
100 had taken that step, and it is a fairly safe bet that
plenty of them, through ignorance or carelessness, will
leave it undone.
The board has given the students frequent warning that
thev must leave their addresses at lite 8.A.C,. oil ices before
the end of the quarter if they want fo receive ticket appli
cations. It is up to the students who want tickets to co
operate with the board in working out its new system.
I Dtil next year there is no possibility of n change in the
plan now being used.
