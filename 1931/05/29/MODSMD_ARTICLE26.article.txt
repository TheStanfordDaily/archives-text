THE PRINCETON IDi:A
(The Daily Princetonian)
The honor system, as first adopted
in 1892-93 and as subsequently for
malized, has become such a funda
mental part of Princeton life and is
so synonymous with "the Princeton
idea,'' that any comment is likely
to be not only obvious but super
fluous. Nevertheless, there is always
;i small number of undergraduates
who have not bothered to familiarize
themselves with the history and na
ture of the system, and who conse
quently are inclined to oppose it on
the grounds that the common law
of honor exists everywhere, and that
the formal honor system implies the
absence of it here. Their further ob
jection is thai it is a crafty means
of hoodwinking students into hon
esty.

The first objection, however, fails
to take into account an important
I act : That many students sincerely
believe that the common law of
honor does not apply to examina
tions. Only when they agree, by
signing the pledge, to make exam
inations subject to the common code
of honesty, do they feel themselves
constrained to forego illegal assist
ance. For the second objection, a
glance at the history of Princeton
shows that the students have not
been hoodwinked, but that they
themselves have asked for this
method of self-supervision. Proc
torial supervision is fundamentally
offensive, and when even* common
honesty is enforced by Faculty po
lice, then cribbing is no longer a
matter of personal honor but a game
to play with the classroom proctors.
The first agitation for the intro
duction of the honor system came
from students themselves in 1892. A
mass meeting was held and a peti
tion was submitted to the Faculty.
"The latter body," says Mr. Collins
in his history of Princeton, "was by
no means unanimous as to the effi
cacy, or indeed the feasibility, of
such a system." Nevertheless, in
January of 1893, the following reso
lution, now a vital part of Prince
ton's tradition, was adopted:

''WHEREAS, It appears that there
has been a strong and growing stu
dent sentiment against the practice
of cheating in examinations, and
further, that the students desire to
have the examinations so conducted
as to be put upon their honor as
gentlemen; Resolved, That until due
notice is given to the contrary there
shall be no supervision of examina
tions, each student simply, at the
end of his paper, subscribing the
following statement:
"I pledge my honor as a gentle
man, etc."
Finally, from a purely practical
standpoint, the honor system works.
it should work perfectly, is
nwre than can be expected from
any method of social regulation that
must combat individual frailties;
but compared to methods of con
straint and supervision, the honor
system is extremely effective and
attests to the responsibility of col
lege men. The few violations that do
occur, are rarely by the small group
of conscientious objectors, but rather
by those who would prove Ihem
selves weak in Ihe discharge of any
obligation. And it might be well to
remind the conscientious objectors
that no one has forced them to at
tend the University to have the
honor system crammed down their
throats. Acceptance and approval of
the honor system in its spirit< and
entirety, is part of the individual's
free decision to come to Princeton.
