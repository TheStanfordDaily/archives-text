WHEN MAN SHALL RISE
When man shall rise to manhood's
destiny,
When our slow-toddling race shall
be full-grown,
Deep in each human heart a cham
ber lone
Of Holies Holiest shall builded be;
And each man for himself must hold
the key;
Each there must kindle his own
altar-fires,
Each burn an offering of his own
desires,
And Each at last his own High
Priest must be.
