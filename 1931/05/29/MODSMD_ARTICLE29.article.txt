STREET SCENE—-At the Geary
Theatre.
II is with appreciation that we
note that "Street Scene" is to he
held another week in San Francisco.
Not only has Sid Grauman brought
the original cast from New York,
the one that won the Pulitzer Prize
for it, but Elmer Rice, the author,
is supervising the presentation.
Every person who claims interest in
modern literature and drama,
should by all means spend two hours
watching a slice from life, as it has
been cut from the city of New York
itself.
JUAN IN AMERICA—By Eric Link
later. Cape and Smith, Nt-w York.
IU3I. (At (he Palo Alto Rook
Shop.)
Picturing America as the last hope
of romantic adventure, because of
the mingling of races. Linklater has
devised his hero as the descendant
of Byron's Don Juan seekiiTg and
finding romance in New York, Hol
lywood, Chicago, and the swamps
of Florida.
The introducing pages picture the
Motley family finally, after Vic
torian and Edwardian Englishness,
producing the throwback, Juan. Sent
to America to college, a mistake on
the football field drives him forth,
taking what comes, and plenty
comes.

| Linklater is well equipped to show
! us our Amcrica, for he has spent
j two years touring its cities, and
I Juan's impressions are filled with
; the reality of interest, not criticism,
j Of course, some adventures are a
i little far-fetched, but to Linklater,
I
lat least, America is anything but
dull. —J.N.
AMBROSE HOLT AND FAMILY—
By Susan G las pell. F. A. Stokes,
New York. I MIL (At the Palo Alto
i Book Shop.)
I Ambrose Jlult, hoping to discover
the elusive reality of life, left his
family. His act affected his poet soil
so greatly, that the latter built a
superficial pose of living around
i himself that excluded his wife. This
i young person was called Blossom
! to her annoyance, lor she wanted
| to be considered sensible and intel
ligent in spite of the luxurious ex
j istence her father provided for her.
Ambrose Holt returned to his
! family in time to create a crisis, and
J through his understanding of Blos
j som, who liked him in spite of her
: husband's conventional minded un
i ger, help them both to a promise
j of future understanding.
Susan Glaspell, in showing ihe
| suffering beneath humanities' little
! loibles, has written a book well
' worth reading. —J.N.
