# Ryan Tendered Dinner In Honor Of Retirement
## Hoover Appoints Ryan To Honorary Position 
### 
Dr, Harris J. Ryan, executive head !
. of the Department of Electrical En- j
j gineering and director of the Ryan
j High Voltage Laboratory since 1926
I when it was established at Stanford
|as a tribute to his recognized
achievements in high voltage re
search, was tendered a dinner given
last night in thei Union by the fac
ulty and students of the department.
Preceding the dinner, which was
occasioned by Dr. Ryan's retirement
from his teaching and executive !
duties so that he may devote his
time to research in high voltage, a i
meeting of the School of Engineering
faculty was held at which Dean j
Theodore J. Hoover announced Dr. j
Ryan's appointment as Honorary
Director of the Ryan Laboratory.
Resolution Passed
A resolution at this meeting was j
passed and at the department dinner
honors were paid, congratulating Dr.
Ryan upon his success as head of
the department and wishing him !
good fortune in the continuation of
his work in high voltage.
Coming to Stanford in 1905 from
Cornell University where he was 1
head of the electrical engineering
department, Dr. Ryan has since be
come world authority in his field, i
He was awarded the Edison Medal
in 1925 by the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers of which he
was president for the year 1923-24.
He has spent his time largely on
the problem of minimizing power |
losses due to corona in the transmis- .
sion of high voltages over long dis- ,
tances, advancing the art to the |
point where the industry can now j
undertake the problem of transmit- |
ting power from the Hoover Dam j
to Los Angeles.
