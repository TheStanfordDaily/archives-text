1 son—a team that will be equipped
with a more powerful attack dis
guised by greater but simplified de
ception. Warner has developed his
j "C" to "A" formation shift, dis
cussed in a previous article, to a
point where it will force the opposi
tion to watch the ball rather than
the team; he has added a full spin
, ner attack, and destroyed certain
"give aways" that tend to "key"
plays; and lastly, while increasing
! deception, he has simplified many
! plays to a point where there is less
chance for bungling than ever be
fore.
For instance, in the new "C" for
i mat ion last year, four variations of
each play were possible, an open,
closed, left and right. This has been
simplified to the point where War-
J ner said last night, "The squad has
some real grasp of the formation
now."

Commenting on California, War
ner said, "Bill Ingram is going at
things in a systematic way over at
California, but nobody expects too
much of him his first year. Much
j will depend on how he gets past his
first few games—there are some
lough ones at the first of the sched
ule, including Santa Clara, St.
Mary's, and the Olympic Club."
