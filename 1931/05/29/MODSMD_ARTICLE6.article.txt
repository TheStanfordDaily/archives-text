# WARNER FEARS ONLY TROJANS NEXT season
## Strengthened Line, More Deception Developed During Spring 
### 
By Lowell Cox
When two picked teams of the
! varsity football squad tangle on the
j practice field at 4 o'clock this after
noon, it will mark the close of what
j "Pop" Warner characterizes "the
most successful spring practice wc
j have ever had at Stanford."
After three months of stilT spring
work it becomes apparent that:
1. "To Big Red Machine"
j will have a much stronger line
j next season.
2. The hackficld will be at
least equal to that of last year's
with Captain flillman, Caddcll.
Targhctta, Baker, Allen, and An
i derson ready to step into the
| shoes of Rothcrt and Simkins at
fullback or quarterback.
.*> No outstanding center has

been developed, but there is
ample material from which
Warner cxpccts to find at least
two good pivot men.
4. The Stanford attack next
| year will he featured by greater
I deception with greater simplicity
| than ever before.
It is to a strengthened forward
wall that Warner looks for Indian
improvement next year, particularly
at guard and tackle.
Tackles Much Stronger
"The guards, while they will not
j be brilliant, they will be good," he
' told the writer in an interview last
night. "The tackles should be much
better than last year. Ehrhorn and
| George Grey were almost regulars
1 last season, and I expect them to
j show improvement next fall. Then
i there is Hand—after trying both end
and guard, he seems to have found
his position at tackle. He's going
! like a house afire.
"The backfield may not be any
better than last year, but it will be
j at least as good."
Rintala Shifted
Speaking of the backficld—look
for it to line up something like this
.next fall: Hillman and Caddel, quar
ter and full; Moffatt, left half, and
Rintala, right half. Warner has de
: cided that Rintala is too good to
, languish on the bench while Moffat
! is in the game, and will pair the two.
As for next season in general,
"Pop" says, "We will have an
improved team and should stand
at least an equal chance with
every outfit in the conference,
EXCEPT Southern California.
Stanford will have to be at a
peak to stand a chance against
1 U.S.C., and would have to catch
t them on an off day to beat them.''
j Don't think for a minute, however,
I that the Old Man is leaving any
i stone unturned concerning the Tro-
I jans. One of them is psychology—
j and the psychology of the under
j dog goes a long way to win football
i games. It was one of the late Knute
j Rockne's cardinal principals. And
I while it must be granted that U.S.C.
j will have a potentially stronger
| team, the game is far from decided
! yet.
More Power, Deception
Certainly Stanford will be repre
j sented by a stronger team next sea

Tackles Much Stronger
"The guards, while they will not
j be brilliant, they will be good," he
' told the writer in an interview last
night. "The tackles should be much
better than last year. Ehrhorn and
| George Grey were almost regulars
1 last season, and I expect them to
j show improvement next fall. Then
i there is Hand—after trying both end
and guard, he seems to have found
his position at tackle. He's going
! like a house afire.
"The backfield may not be any
better than last year, but it will be
j at least as good."
Rintala Shifted
Speaking of the backficld—look
for it to line up something like this
.next fall: Hillman and Caddel, quar
ter and full; Moffatt, left half, and
Rintala, right half. Warner has de
: cided that Rintala is too good to
, languish on the bench while Moffat
! is in the game, and will pair the two.
As for next season in general,
"Pop" says, "We will have an
improved team and should stand
at least an equal chance with
every outfit in the conference,
EXCEPT Southern California.
Stanford will have to be at a
peak to stand a chance against
1 U.S.C., and would have to catch
t them on an off day to beat them.''
