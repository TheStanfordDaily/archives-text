# UNION FACILITIES OPEN TO SUMMER QUARTER GROUP
## Full Program to be Maintained in Dining Room, Cellar, Cafeteria Curtailment Will Be Made Only if Trade Falls Off 
### 
The Union dining room and cafeteria
and the Cellar and store are open for
business and, almost without doubt,
will continue in operation throughout
the quarter.
The only question is whether they
will receive sufficient patronage to
make it possible to keep them open.
"We hope to keep all parts of the
Union service open throughout the
summer," says Miss Christine Richer,
Director of Dining Halls and Stanford
Union. "We want to make the facilities
available to students and faculty and
lo meet the needs and preferences of
all, and we certainly hope to be able
to keep all the departments running.
"The dining room meets the require
ments of those who want to be served
at tables and take their time for con
versation. The cafeteria cares for those
who want to select their lunches and
dinners from the counter, while the
Cellar, in addition to the between
meals refreshments, offers light lunches,
specializing in salads and fresh vege
tables which arc especially desirable
during the summer. After 8 o'clock in
the evening, patrons wishing booth
service will be asked to get their orders
at the counter and take them to the
booths.
The dining room is open daily ex
cept Saturdays from 12 to 1 o'clock
and from G to 7 o'clock. The cafeteria
is open from 11:45 to 1 o'clock and
from 5:30 to 6:45 daily except Sundays.
The Cellar and Union store arc open
daily from 7:30 in the morning until
10:30 o'clock at night.
"The Union makes its own ice
cream," Miss Ricker points out, "and
we are very proud of its quality. We
arc able to offer a wide variety of
flavors in our ices and in the drinks
and dishes, utilizing our ice cream and
ices.
"In former years, it is the Cellar
where patronage has fallen nearest the
danger line but we hope this year to
lie able to maintain it throughout the
quarter."
The Union store, besides the tobacco,
cigarettes, and candy, which constitute
its chief business, carries a stock of
some 2,000 items, providing a sort of
little country store to meet the emer
gency needs of campus residents for
minor drug supplies and similar ar
ticles.
