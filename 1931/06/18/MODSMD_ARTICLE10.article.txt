Intended primarily for candidates for
advanced degrees, A. E. Sokol of the
German department, is offering a course
in rapid reading. While the course will
cover grammatical foundations insofar
as may be necessary, it is intended to
give quickly a reading knowledge of
the language to those who may wish
to take one of their foreign language
requirements in German.
