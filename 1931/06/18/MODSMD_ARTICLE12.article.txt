# WILBUR ON WAY WEST EXPECTED ON CAMPUS DURING THE SUMMER
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, presi
dent of the University now on leave of
absence and serving as Secretary of
the Interior in President Hoover's cabi
net, will be the Commencement speaker
at Western Reserve University at
Cleveland, Ohio, today.
From there he will move westward
toward California, where it is thought
he will spend some time on vacation.
He has a summer home, "The Pines,"
near Donner Lake. It is not known
when he may visit the campus, though
it is taken for granted that he will be
here at some time before he returns
to his duties in the national capital.
His leave of absence from Stanford ex
pires with the beginning of the new
academic year, September 1. There has
been considerable newspaper talk about
the possibility of an extension of that
leave, but nothing official has come be
fore the Board of Trustees, nor has
there been any intimation that the sub
ject will come up, or if it does, at what
time.
Dr. Wilbur left Washington Tuesday
night and went first to Yale Univer
sity, where he took part in the com
mencement exercises. He has arranged
to spend 10 days in Colorado. Later he
is to attend a hearing at Yosemite Na
tional Park regarding means of reach
ing Glacier Point from the floor of the
valley.
He will visit Las Vegas, Nevada, July
3. With other Interior Department of
ficials he will inspect Hoover Dam.
He is also to take part in formal
dedication exercises at Lassen Volcanic
Park July 25.
He is accompanied by Mrs. Wilbur.
