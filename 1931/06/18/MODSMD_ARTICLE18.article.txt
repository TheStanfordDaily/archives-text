dishes, themselves are doing that work.
The situation is still further compli
j cated by the movement in Palo Alto,
as in other cities, to give preference to
| men having families to support. How
ever, restaurants and other similar
places in Palo Alto which have gener

j taking their usual number.
"The appointment service will havr
a few jobs which offer room and board
I for work," says Mrs. Spenner. Tutors
