Every man and woman registering as a student becomes
thereby a full citizen of the Stanford red tile principality, with
all the rights and privileges of that citizenship.

of good fellowship, informality, comradeship. You don't need
introductions to give you the right and the pleasure of saying
"hello" to any other Stanford citizen —any other member of the
Stanford family—as you meet.
On the other hand, nobody is going to force you to say "hello,"
nobody is going to compel you to lake your rightful share of Ihe
com unity life and comradeship; you'll have to do that yourself.
But if you want it, it is here for you. Better take it, make your
self at home here, get out this brief quarter all the joy of living
that is vours if you will accept it.
