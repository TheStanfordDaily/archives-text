# THE 						STANFORD DAILY
## 
### 
One of llie peculiar Stanford Sumer Quarter institutions is
its newspaper, a "Daily" published twice a week. The anainolv
comes about because the paper, which is the official organ of
the student body, lias an official name, "The Stanford Daily,"
but lias not yet acquired a Summer Quarter clientele large
enough to make it financially possible to publish it oftener than
twice a week.
But aside from this idiosyncracy of name, the Summer
Quarter Daily strives to be a normal newspaper for its com
munity.
It prints the news of the campus and gives you information
about things that are going to take place in which you may be
interested.
Through this service and through its comments on Stanford
affairs and on anything in which Stanford men and women may
be interested it tries to be an influence to bind the community
together and to be a medium for expressing Stanford ideas.
To help in this effort, the Daily eagerly welcomes and will
print communications from its readers on topics of general
Stanford interest. To the writers of such letters the great value
of brevity is suggested. Brief letters will be more thoroughly
read and make more impression than long ones. Writers of
such letters must make their identity known to the editors,
though if they prefer their names need not be attached to the
letters when they are printed. The Daily would rather print the
authors' names but does not insist on it.
One suggestion the Daily makes to letter writers.: Don't con
centrate exclusively on finding fault.- The natural instinct of
people when they "write to the paper" seems to be to complain,
upbraid, and condemn. All right if there is something that can
be corrected through having its evil aspects pointed out; send
in your complaint. But once in a while it n>av be that something
may occur to you as worth commenting on because it is good and
praise-worthy rather than bad and demanding objurgation. Let
us be as cheerful as we may.
