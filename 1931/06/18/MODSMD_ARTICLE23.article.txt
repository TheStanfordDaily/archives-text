# KEEP A SENSE OF PROPORTION

### 
There is some sense in the typical undergrad's disdain oi the
"grind." Oi course there is good ground tor tlie common atti
tude of humorous contempt for the so-called college student
whose least concern is wilh his studies il they intcrtere with his
education as he finds i! almost exclusively in social endeavors,
athletics, or other purely extra-curricular pursuits.
Neither of these extremes is getting all that he might; they
have lost their sense of proportion and are centering too exclu
sively on one set of opportunities that college life otters and
missing other valuable chances for education altogether.
Education lies in getting out of one's self us much as possible
of the potential powers that lie within one. A student who con
fines himself too narrowly to the set subjects of his courses
limits himself thereby in securing all the education he might
obtain. There are lectures here this summer for which no Uni
versity credit is given but which would help mightily toward a
man's education. There are pictures, plays, music, trips to en
large the horizon of knowledge and interest, receptions and
dances to enlarge the circle of valuable human acquaintance.
It is a good thing to be thoroughly in earnest about ;i main
objective, but a crippling thing to be so intensely absorbed by
that single objective that every other avenue to a broad educa
tion is blocked ofY. Relax a little once in awhile; spread out a
little and grow.
