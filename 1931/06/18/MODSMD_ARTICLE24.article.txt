# IT'S A TERRIBLE WORLD, MATES
## 
### 
The collected commencement addresses and baccalaureate
sermons of the present season would make a volume ot possibly
the most disimil reading ever conceived. Ifs a cock-eyed world
that our elders have been bringing to our attention, and, say
tliev, unless the younger generation conies through as it ought
to there's going to be worse to follow. Well, there's reliel in
having the older generation for once abandon its customary
attitude of gentle condescension toward the younger and its
warnings not to imagine that young people can take the world
by the tail and make it behave. Rut as a matter ot tact the world
is not in such permanently dfisperatc straits as the commence
ment orators in their panic h;ive been telling us. It always is
in need of improvement and lie hope <>t improvement always
has lain, as it does now, with the rising generation. And, by
and large, in one way or anoiher, the rising generation has
managed to cope with the bad World and make it behave as
well as could In* reasonably e\pe<xcd, all things considered.
