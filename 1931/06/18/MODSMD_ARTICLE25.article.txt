# STANFORD MUSEUM, SPRINGING FROM PLAN OF BOY TO WHOM IT IS NOW MEMORIAL, CONTAINS MUCH OF INTEREST AND VALUE
## 
### 
The Stanford Museum, first rein- I
forced concrete building ever erected, |
is a special memorial to Leland Stan
ford, Jr., in whose memory the Uni- ;
versity was created by his parents, and j
an emblem of his boyish ambition to
erect in San Francisco when he became j
older a public museum for the people
of that city. Within the Stanford Mu
seum are objects which he was gather
ing at the time of his early death with
this ambition in view.
The Museum now contains many in
teresting collections, many of them gilts
of friends of the University and many
of great cultural value.
One of the excellent . collections js
that of early American and colonial
material. In this collection may be seen
a check written and signed by George
Washington. A musket used by some
patriot of '7ti is also u part of the col
lection.
The Museum contains a collection of
Oriental antiques from China and
Japan. This is known as the Jkeda
group and was purchased by Mrs.
Stanford from the widow of the man
whose name it bears and who got it
together. Other Oriental material of
great value was donated to the Museum
by Timothy Hopkins, an associate of
Senator Stanford, and the last of the
original group of Trustees. The Egyp
tian collection was gotten together for
Mrs. Stanford by Emil Brusch Bey,
curator of the museum of Cairo. The
Egyptologist Sayse has evaluated this
as being "very good original material.''
In another room there is a miscel
laneous display of museum articles
from different parts of the world. How
ever, a great part of the space in this
room is being given over to a display
of European crafts and articles depict
ing the life of North American Indians.
California History Depicted
Early California history is depicted
in still another room. Here one may see
the first railroad locomotive to steam
into California, the "Governor Stan
ford No. 1." As one might surmise by
consideration of its capacious maw, it
is a wood-burnerâ€”at one time called
"hay burner," according to Frank B.
Lemos, curator, because the sparks
which blew from its smoke stack as the
engine puffed its way across the plains,
frequently sfet fire to the tall grass.
Finally an ingenious mechanic pro
vided an inverted funnel with a screen
across the exhaust pipe and thus re
moved the fire hazard.
A memorial room on the second floor
contains many family effects, together
with articles associated with the lives
of the founders and early history of
the University. One case contains arti
cles pertaining to the completion of the
first transcontinental railroad, the Cen
tral Pacific, of which Senator Stanford
was president. The famous last spike
driven in the building of the road, and
the hammer with which Senator Stan
ford drove it, are there.
Twenty-Three Double Eagles Used
Twenty-three double eagles were
used in the casting of this spike. These
gold-pieces were taken by David
Hewes, a brother-in-law of Mrs. Stan
ford, to a San Francisco goldsmith,
who cast the spike and sent it to
Promontory, Utah, near Ogden, where
the Central Pacific line ended.
On the golden spike is inscribed the
date, "May 13, 1869." Because of delays
which frequently could not be foreseen
in pioneer days of railroad building,

Ihe spike was driven a few days later.
Fossils muke up an interesting pari
of the displays. A large collection was
turned over to the Museum by Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president of
ihe University. A group of restoration
drawings of fossils, showing how fish
looked when they were alive at a period
which scientists believe was more than (
a million years ago, may be seen here. <
General Grant's Uniform Shown
A collection of sea life species, which
includes crabs, star fish, and a variety
of specimens from the sea gardens
practically tills the large balcony in the
center of the building. The skeleton of
a Great Auk, a bird which has been
extinct for more than 70 years, is
looked upon as one of the most pre
cious of museum pieces. Although it 1
had well-developed wing bones, the
Great Auk was unable to Hy. "This in
capacity was perhaps due because of j
its great weight," says Mr. Lemos. The
bird stands nearly two feet in height.
In the family room may be seen a
case of material collected by the family
of President U. S. Grant, who was a
friend of thk Stanfords. A uniform
which General Grant wore during the
Civil War is there.
This room also contains a collection
of toys with which young Leland Stan
ford played and a number of drawings
made by him. Some of the boy's wood ,
carvings which are shown here won
distinction at the California State Fair,
Boyish Interest Fathered Museum
This boyish interest accounts for the
Museum. When Leland, Jr., was X
years old his father gave him a little
cabinet in which he put collections of
fossils and natural history materials,
j such as wasps' nests, birds' eggs, and
petrified wood. A few years later the
! Stanfords went to Europe. It was on
his return to California after this trip
that the thirteen-year-old boy seems
to have conceived definitely the idea of
establishing some day a museum in his !
own city of San Francisco.
A second trip to Europe was under
taken some two years later, and it was
during this visit that the youth became
infected with the virus of Roman fever 1
from which he never recovered. When
Senator and Mrs. Stanford finally con
cluded to found a university in mem
ory of their son, it seemed very ap
propriate to establish a museum as a
personal memorial to the boy.
First Reinforced Concerte Building
Friends of Senator Stanford tried to
dissuade him from the idea of trying to
erect a building of iron and cement.
: Nevertheless, he went ahead. When the
, work was under way he frequently
! came to Palo Alto to make sure that
j the cement was properly mixed and
that the reinforcing was done as he
thought it should be.
The new type of building was given
a thorough test by the earthquake of
190G, and is said to have stood the
strain better than any other building in
this- vicinity. Wings added to the origi-
I nal building in later years were badly
j damaged.
j Marble used in the building was
quarried in Amador county, California.
| It is hand-carved.

More machines at work producing
' heat and more homes and office build
! ings heated makes the city warmer
i than the country in winter, says Pro-
j lessor Leo Holdredge, University of j
j Tennessee engineer.
