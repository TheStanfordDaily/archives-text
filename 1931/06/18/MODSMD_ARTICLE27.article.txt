# TWO LOAN EXHIBITS STAY IN ART GALLERY UNTIL END OF MONTH
## 
### 
Two loan exhibitions now in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery
will bo retained until the end of the
month, ten clays from now, when the
plan is to replace them with other ex
hibits.
One of these exhibits is a collection
of water colors by Mildred Burrage,
showing deserted buildings in the old
mining town of Virginia City and
scenes near there. Painted with a
modernistic style, these water colors
convey the spirit and atmosphere of
this "dead" old city and of the re
minders of former activity in the coun
try about it.
The other exhibition is made up of
etchings by two brothers, Benjamin C.
Brown and Ilowell C. Brown. In the
fifty pictures on the walls almost all
the methods of making etchings are
represented, including lithographs and
drypoints. A number are interesting
studies in soft color. The subjects are
largely landscapes in California, Ari
zona, and in Europe.
All three artists have won recogni
tion in Europe and the principal art
cities of the United States.
In the other galleries of the building
are pictures selected from the Thomas
Welton Stanford collection and other
paintings that the University owns.
The art gallery is open daily from
10 o'clock to 5 and admission is without
lee.
