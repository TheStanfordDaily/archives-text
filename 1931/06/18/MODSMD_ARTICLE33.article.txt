"The surface supply as impounded in
the two reservoirs at Searsville and
Felt Lake is quite limited, and is, for
the most part being held in reserve to
meet any emergency," says Mr. Trow
bridge. "A gi-eat portion of the supply
used by the Stanford community both
for irrigation and domestic purposes is
being pumped from underground
sources. In view of these conditions it
behooves every one to be extremely
careful of waste."
Mr. Trowbridge says that the supply
is ample to care for the actual needs of
the community. It is imperative, how
ever, that it be conserved.
