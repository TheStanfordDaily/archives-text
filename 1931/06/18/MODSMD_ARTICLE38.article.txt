# ARBORETUM IS REMINDER OF DAYS BEFORE STANFORD RANCH WAS UNIVERSITY CAMPUS
## 
### 
Reminders of the time when the Uni
versity campus was the country estate
of the Stanford family, the Palo Alto
Farm, where guests from among the
eminent men of the country were en
tertained by the senator and war-time
governor of the country are found in
the arboretum, which stretches along
Palm Drive from the entrance gates to
the Quad.
Senator Stanford began the planting
of these trees with the idea that here
on his great ranch, which ultimately
would become the permanent home of
the family, he would have specimens of
as nearly as possible all the trees of the
world.
Today the University has much the
same idea in mind, although the de
velopment of the arboretum is a slow
process on account of lack of available
funds to secure specimens and to main
tain them if planted. For years follow
ing the lean years of the government
suit and its aftermath the arboretum
was necessarily almost wholly neglect
ed and in those years the arboretum
became crowded with underbrush and
with eucalyptus and other trees that
were planted primarily as a protection
for the young trees of more valuable
species. Insect depredations took a
heavy toll in those years also.
Gifts Increase Varieties
Since that time the University has
been able to clear out superfluous
growth, get rid of many superfluous
eucalypty—though the cutting of those
trees frequently raised protests among
misunderstanding tree lovers—and to
set aside funds to add somewhat to the
number of specimens, irrigate and care
for young trees, and to label the trees
that constitute a growing botanical j
laboratory.
Friends of the University have in- !
creased the number of varieties avail- !
able for this scientific object.
Best Location in World
In the future it may be that the
Stanford arboretum will become the
best in the world. The clmiate and
topography of the locality makes it pos
sible for a wider variety of trees to j
grow here than in almost any other 1
region on earth. Already there are rep- !
rcscntatives of sub-arctic and sub- '
tropic regions thriving successfully on J
the campus.
It is possible that sometime the arbo- i
return may stretch from the state high- j
way up through the campus and fur
ther to the Skyline Boulevard. Such a
plan has been suggested a number of
times, the upper reaches being devel- [
oped by public co-operation to form a '
recreation ground.
Guests Planted Trees
It was a custom of the Stanfords to
have guests at their country estate
plant trees as permanent pleasant re
minders of their stays. This custom was
continued after the University had been I
founded and visitors to the campus
were still invited to plant trees in
commemoration of their stay here. This
explains the many trees in various lo- '
calitics with signs indicating that emi
nent men set them out in different
years. <*M 4 j i
Many of these trees, especially near ;
the Stanford residence, now the Con
valescent Home, died during the years ,
of enforced neglect and only the signs
remain to mark the visits of many
eminent men of the nation.
Reminder of Broken Plan
Radiating from the Mausoleum where
rest the bodies of the Stanford family
may be observed double rows of trees, '
some flanking roads that still exist and
some merely indications that roads once (
ran there. i
These trees arc a memento of a plan
that was broken and changed by the
death of the Stanfords 1 only son, Lcland
Stanford, Jr., which led to the found
ing of the University in his memory.

At the point from which these tree
formed spokes radiate and which is
marked now by the tomb the Stanfords
planned to build a larger and more
beautiful home than that which they
had enlarged from the original adobe
structure that was on the ranch when
they purchased it. The tree-bordered
avenues were to afford vistas and
pleasant highways from this new home
in all directions.
When their son died and they had
established the University Senator and
Mrs. Stanford built here on the spot
which they had planned as the center
of their family life the marble struc
ture to be the permanent resting-place
of the bodies of the family.
To Preserve Natural Growth
As part of the living laboratory pur
pose of the arboretum the University
has set aside a number of plots in dif
ferent localities where the growth is
protected from interferences with its
continuing as an example of the origi
nal indigenous growth. This explains
the origin and purpose of signs that
may be found noting that the area
fenced off is a "botanical preserve"
and that trespassing is forbidden.
