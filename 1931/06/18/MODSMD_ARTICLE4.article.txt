# Dean Sellards Welcomes Students, Old and New, To Stanford For Summer
## 
### 
Some of you arc on familiar ground,
having been at Stanford during the
rest of the academic year, or during
preceding summer quarters. Others are
newcomers, who represent various le
gions of the country, and to these new
students we all join in extending a
spirit of hospitality.

The student-body is less closely or
ganized in summer than during the
j other quarters of the academic year;
j but being smaller, and with a much
larger proportion in actual residence on
! the University campus, there is a dio
| tinctivc community life.

In addition to carrying through your
program of study, it is hoped that you
will all find an opportunity not only for 1
pleasant recreation, but to extend the !
scope of your interests during your |
stay at Stanford.
The program of public lectures at- i
ranged for the Summer Quarter is suf- I
ficiently varied to provide subjects in J
many fields of general culture. In addi
tion to the various lectures in English,
students have an opportunity to follow
lecture series in some of the principal
foreign languages.
There is a real opportunity to hear
the best in music during the Summer !
Quarter, at the open-air Woodland
Theatn n F'llsborough, near Stanford, ;
where- es of symphony concerts is !
given on ounday afternoons. The open
ing concert is set for June 21, the first |
Sunday of the quarter, and the series
continues for eight weeks, with pro
grams given by members of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra under
the direction of distinguished conduc
tors. A special low rate has been made
for Stanford students, and for those j
who have not cars there is special
automobile service from the campus to
the Woodland Theatre.
In order that those of you who do ;
not know this region of California may
sec the points of interest inexpensively
and under pleasant conditions, automo
bile excursions for student parties have |
been arranged for week-ends during
the quarter.
It is hoped that you will all have a
successful and pleasant summer, and
will enjoy the recreations and relation- ;
ships fostered by our community lift,
to which Stanford welcomes you.
