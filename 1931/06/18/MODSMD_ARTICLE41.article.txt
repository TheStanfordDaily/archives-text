# GORDON DAVIS, CAMPUS COP, FINDS VIRTUES IN SUMMER STUDENTS
## 
### 
| Gordon Davis, the campus traffic offi
cer, who slides along roads as incon
-1 spicuously as his snow-white car will
| permit, doesn't enjoy arresting students
for breaking the law but he declares
; that he will do it if necessary—and he
j makes good his threat.
At that, Davis looks forward to a
i comparatively pleasant time during the
f summer, for his experience, he says, is
! that *the typical summer quarter stu
! dent is more heedful of regulations
! than the students of other times of the
year. His theory to explain this is that
the average summer quarter student
is not only older but is more careful
of his money. "They do not, so many
of them, have fond parents to meet the
expenses of their automobile pleas
ures," he says.
But in one respect he finds that the
summer quarter students are more
, prone to break rules than are autumn,
l winter, and spring quarter students,
I and that is with regard to parking. He
: doesn't hazard a guess at the reason
j for this, but lets it go with the mere
I statement of fact that in the summer
! he finds cars parked across walks and
j in all sorts of improper places.
"More people are fined for violating
| parking rules in the summer," Davis
j says, "than in all the other quarters
; put together. They don't seem able to
| see a fire plug; at least they park too
| close to re plugs in altogether too many
i cases. I have tagged two cars at the
I same time for parking alongside the
j same fire plug."
The most common infraction is the
j failure of students to keep their regis
i tration cards or pink slips in a plainly
j visible place, as required by law, Offi
| cer Davis says. "Failure to do this,"
I he remarks sententiously, "means a fine
! of $1 when detected.
When Davis arrests students for
I traffic violations on the campus he re
j ports them to the student councils, who
meet out the penalties. Off-campus
i residents caught breaking traffic laws
j on the campus, arc, of course, made to
j report to a police court as are students
I who arc arrested off the campus.

"More people are fined for violating

| close to re plugs in altogether too many
i cases. I have tagged two cars at the

When Davis arrests students for
