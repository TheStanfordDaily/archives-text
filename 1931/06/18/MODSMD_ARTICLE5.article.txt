# POSTOFFICE OFFERS SUGGESTIONS FOR SPEEDING LETTERS
## Campus Residents Are Urged To Fill Out Directory Cards at Once 
### 
The Stanford post office offers sug
gestions to those who prefer to receive j
their mail promptly rather than after I
a greater or less delay.
In the first place, let the campus post !
! office know what your address is and |
how you prefer to have your letters |
1 delivered. They have cards to be filled |
out for that purpose.
Mail will be delivered by carriers to
[all campus residents except those liv- j
ing in dormitories, where they may ap- i
ply at the general delivery window or l
, rent boxes. Boxes are available for the !
summer quarter now and should be en- j
gaged at once.
j Notify your correspondents of your '
1 correct address, with the street number :
j if your mail is to be delivered by car- !
rier, or your box number if you have
j one.
If you change your address, remem
! ber to notify the post office.
I Letters received without full address
j are necessarily delayed in delivery
while the clerks look up the proper
j address if, indeed, they are able to find
!it at all. It is especially difficult, too,
[ for them to find correct addresses bc
i fore the Bawlout is issued.
Beg your correspondents to address
i your letters to Stanford University and
not to Palo Alto uiiless you live in
j Palo Alto. erVy likely they will con
| tinue to put Palo Alto on the envelope,
i for it is almost impossible to eradicate
j from some minds that Palo Alto is a
! necessary part of the address of Stan
i ford students. But the effort is worth
while because if a postal clerk, working j
1 against time on a mail car, happens to ;
catch the name Palo Alto on a letter, j
j he will throw it into the bag for that j
office rather than into the one coming i
to Stanford direct and time will be lost j
in forwarding it then to the campus.
