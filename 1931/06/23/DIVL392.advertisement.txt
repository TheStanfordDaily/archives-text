We Sell Satisfaction to a Man
When We Sell Him
FOOTWEAR
We know that if a man is well sold the
first time (properly fitted with good shoes
at the right prices) then the next time he
will sell himself, and eventually become a
regular customer. Because he's satisfied.
We specialize on good dependable Foot
wear and Proper Fitting is our hobby. We
have just installed an
X-RAY SHOE FITTER
, to assure you of a correct and proper fit.
A machine which tells at a glance just
exactly how your foot is fitted. It is par
ticularly helpful in fitting the unusual foot.
Wise parents should be interested, for it
shows exactly the amount of room allowed
for the children's growth and development.
