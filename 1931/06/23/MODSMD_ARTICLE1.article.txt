# "GAY NINETIES" ON THE "FARM" ROUGH 'N READY
## Dean Sheldon of Oregon Reviews Pioneer Campus Days Says National Politics Took Precedence Over Sports! 
### 
"Yes the University has changed a
great deal in every way since 1892,"
visiting Professor Henry D. Sheldon,
dean of the School of Education in the
University of Oregon and student body
president of Stanford in 1896, said to
day.
"We led a simpler life in those days,'
Professor Sheldon stated. "In 1892 when
I entered Stanford there were perhaps
'100 students enrolled, half of whom
were women. The Quad as we know
it today was non-existent, what is now
the inner-quad containing the only
classrooms. Chapel was held in the
present Little Theatre and graduation
was in a large wooden gym on the out
skirts of the campus."
Professor Sheldon remembers the
Stanford of the Gay Nineties, of the
days of the Plug Ugly and of the vali
antly battled Faculty-Senior Class
baseball game. He is able to look back
through the years to the time when a
date at Mills College was a matter of
hitching up a horse and buggy and pro
viding for a week-end excursion across
the bay instead of the forty-minute
jaunt it is today.
Palm Drive Was Unpavcd
He remembers when David Starr Jor
dan, now President Emeritus, would
drive up the then unpaved Palm Drive
in his fancy phaeton and offer a ride
to some student who was unfortunate
enough to have missed the Palo Alto
horse-drawn carryall.
In answer to the inevitable question
concerning the Big Game, Professor
Sheldon was forced to admit that there
was just as much "painting the town
red" in 1895 as there is in 1931. It was
in the glamorous pre-earthquake days
of San Francisco and the old Palace
Hotel was the gathering place of the
Stanford Red before the Big Game with
California. The late Walter Camp,
dean of American coaches, as Stanford's
football mentor, was paving the way
for a long string of Stanford victories.
Professor Sheldon stated that social
hfe was largely confined to the cam
pus. National politics took the place
of sporting events in the student's mind.
(In 1892, after Cleveland's landslide,
rivalry became so great between the
two political factions on the campus
that the Republican Club created a
minor riot by turning a fire hose on a
meeting of the jubilant Democratic
students.
Class Rivalry Was Keen
In campus politics Herbert Hoover
and Will Irwin were the political
bosses. They organized the "barb"
movement, which drove the fraterni
ties from political supi'emacy.
Class rivalry was at a fever heat and
it was a weary road from Menlo for
the unwary freshman if an upper class
man deigned to notice him. The sopho
mores and juniors gleefully trailed their
prey to the very doors of Encina, the
sanctuary.
Professor Sheldon believes that the
student of the nineties was on the
whole an older, more serious individual
than the one of today. Due to the flex
ible entrance requirements many were
able to enter the University without
the necessary credits, but they were
faced with the necessity of making
them up during their four years in col
lege in addition to their University
work.
Former Students More Mature
"The student of that day was per
haps more 'hardheaded' than the one of
today," said Professor Sheldon, "but
I do not believe he was any more
advanced scholastically; however it
cannot be denied that they were much
more mature."
Professor Sheldon is a golf enthu
siast and looks with great favor upon
the new Stanford golf course, declar
ing it to be one of the best he has seen.
He does admit that it is a great change
from the meadow of '92, where Sena
tor Stanford's thoroughbred race horses
used to gambol.
Professor Sheldon graduated in 1596
along with President Ray Lyman Wil
bur, now Seci'etary of the Interior in
President Hoover's Cabinet. Among his
many activities was that of inter-col
legiate debater.

"Yes the University has changed a
great deal in every way since 1892,"
visiting Professor Henry D. Sheldon,
dean of the School of Education in the
University of Oregon and student body
president of Stanford in 1896, said to
day.
"We led a simpler life in those days,'
Professor Sheldon stated. "In 1892 when
I entered Stanford there were perhaps
'100 students enrolled, half of whom
were women. The Quad as we know
it today was non-existent, what is now
the inner-quad containing the only
classrooms. Chapel was held in the
present Little Theatre and graduation
was in a large wooden gym on the out
skirts of the campus."
Professor Sheldon remembers the
Stanford of the Gay Nineties, of the
days of the Plug Ugly and of the vali
antly battled Faculty-Senior Class
baseball game. He is able to look back
through the years to the time when a
date at Mills College was a matter of
hitching up a horse and buggy and pro
viding for a week-end excursion across
the bay instead of the forty-minute
jaunt it is today.
Palm Drive Was Unpavcd
He remembers when David Starr Jor
dan, now President Emeritus, would
drive up the then unpaved Palm Drive
in his fancy phaeton and offer a ride
to some student who was unfortunate
enough to have missed the Palo Alto
horse-drawn carryall.
In answer to the inevitable question
concerning the Big Game, Professor
Sheldon was forced to admit that there
was just as much "painting the town
red" in 1895 as there is in 1931. It was
in the glamorous pre-earthquake days
of San Francisco and the old Palace
Hotel was the gathering place of the
Stanford Red before the Big Game with
California. The late Walter Camp,
dean of American coaches, as Stanford's
football mentor, was paving the way
for a long string of Stanford victories.
Professor Sheldon stated that social
hfe was largely confined to the cam
pus. National politics took the place
of sporting events in the student's mind.
(In 1892, after Cleveland's landslide,
rivalry became so great between the
two political factions on the campus
that the Republican Club created a
minor riot by turning a fire hose on a
meeting of the jubilant Democratic
students.
Class Rivalry Was Keen
In campus politics Herbert Hoover
and Will Irwin were the political
bosses. They organized the "barb"
movement, which drove the fraterni
ties from political supi'emacy.
Class rivalry was at a fever heat and
it was a weary road from Menlo for
the unwary freshman if an upper class
man deigned to notice him. The sopho
mores and juniors gleefully trailed their
prey to the very doors of Encina, the
sanctuary.
Professor Sheldon believes that the
student of the nineties was on the
whole an older, more serious individual
than the one of today. Due to the flex
ible entrance requirements many were
able to enter the University without
the necessary credits, but they were
faced with the necessity of making
them up during their four years in col
lege in addition to their University
work.
Former Students More Mature
"The student of that day was per
haps more 'hardheaded' than the one of
today," said Professor Sheldon, "but
I do not believe he was any more
advanced scholastically; however it
cannot be denied that they were much
more mature."
Professor Sheldon is a golf enthu
siast and looks with great favor upon
the new Stanford golf course, declar
ing it to be one of the best he has seen.
He does admit that it is a great change
from the meadow of '92, where Sena
tor Stanford's thoroughbred race horses
used to gambol.
