# SATIRIC FARCE OPENS SUMMER DRAMA SEASON
## "Inspector General" By Gogol To Be Given July 10 
### 
The first play of the summer dra
matic season will be "The Inspector-
General," a satiric farce in three acts,
by Nikolai Gogol. It will be given July
10. Universally conceded to be one of
the very greatest European comedies
of the past century, this play was
written to drag into light "all that was
bad in Russia" and to hold it in con
tempt.
Gogol, whose dates ai'e 1809-1852, was
a writer noted for his stories of Cos
sackdom and Little-Russian life. In
this play he has succeeded in rendering
ludicrous and contemptible the official
life of Russia, the corruption univer
sally prevailing throughout the civil
service.
This high-spirited play, with all the
great freshness and originality for
which its author is known, first ap
peared on the stage in 1836. In spite of
the opposition of the official classes,
whose malpractices it exposed, it
achieved full success. A keen-witted
satire on oicial crookedness and hu
man stupidity, it has remained fresh
on the stages of the theatrical capitols
of the world, and remains to this day
one of the finest and most genial crea
tions of the theater.
Though other versions of the play
have appeared in English, none has
possessed the rapid-fire movement that
characterizes the present version which
was made especially for a Jed Harris
production by John Anderson, well
known critic and, at present, reviewer
for the New York American.
Harold Helvenston, director of dra
matics, obtained the rights to produce
"The Inspector-General" at Stanford,
directly through Barrett Clark of the
Samuel French Company, while in the
East recently.
Preliminary tryouts for the play were
held last night.
