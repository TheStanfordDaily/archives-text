# PHYSICS MECHANICIAN TO WORK ON RULING ENGINE AT PASADENA
## 
### 
In order to aid in the attempt of the
Carnegie Institute of Washington to
I build a successful ruling engine for
i the ruling of diffraction gratings, Sid
! ney W. Borrow, mechanician in the
Stanford Department of Physics will
I go next January to the Mount Wilson
j Observatory at Pasadena. Although in
l struments are sometimes assembled at
; the observatory on Mount Wilson, the
actual building is done in Pasadena,
| where the institute maintains a large
j staff of instrument builders.
The ruling engine, the purpose of
| which is to rule diffraction gratings for
j spectrum analysis, is being worked on
' under the direction of Dr. Walter S.
I Adams. The engine rules with a dia-
I mond point, on an optically worked
(surface of speculum metal; it should
i make 35,000 lines to the inch.
There have been several attempts to
| make ruling engines in the United
i States and in Europe. The only suc
i cessful one in the United States so far
j is the one now in use at Johns Hopkins
i University in Maryland.
