# SUMMER REGISTRATION FAILS TO EQUAL 1930
## 
### 
When the Registrar's office closed
yesterday afternoon 1,081 students were
enrolled. Of these, 971 had completed
the process of registration, while 110
still had some details to finish in order
to complete the process.
The total last night was 139 less than
it was on the corresponding day a year
ago, when it was 1,220. Enrollment this
year will doubtless exceed a thousand
by a considerable number within a few
days*
