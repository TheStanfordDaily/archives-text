# WILBUR LEAVE IS EXTENDED AT HOOVER REQUEST
## University Head To Remain As Secretary Of Interior For Another Year Doctor Swain To Continue As Acting President During 1932 
### 
In the belief that the nation need'?
the services of President Ray Lyman
Wilbur to carry through undertakings
that he has instituted as secretary of
the interior, the Board of Trustees of
the University has acceded to the re
quest of President Hoover and ex
tended Dr. Wilbur's leave of absence
from the Presidency of Stanford
through the calendar year of 1932.
This action was announced at the
conclusion of the board meeting last
Thursday by Leland W. Cutler, presi
dent of the board, who at the same
time said that Dr. Robert E. Swain will
continue to be acting president of tiie
University, as he has been since Dr.
Wilbur was first given leave of ab
sence at the time of the inauguration
of President Hoover.
Cutler made public the resolution of
the Board of Trustees extending Presi
dent Wilbur's leave, as follows:
"Resolved, That at the request of the
President of the United States, and in
recognition of the outstanding import
ance to the nation of the continuation
to effective completion of the services
of Dr. Wilbur as secretary of the in
terior, his leave be extended to and
including December 31, 1932."
This extension of President Wilbur's
leave of absence from the University
without salary, the second that has
been made since the original leave was
granted, will make his term of office as
head of the ticklish interior depart
ment, practically coextensive with that
of the present administration.
Since taking office as secretary Dr.
Wilbur has undertaken a large num
ber of significant enterprises and made
a number of important changes in af
fairs coming under his jurisdiction,
several of which are still in process of
completion. Among these are the ad
ministration of Indian affairs, the start
of the Hoover dam, with its compli
cated difficulties and the extremely
complicated and difficult control of
petroleum and natural gas production.
Interesting to Stanford men and
women is the fact that all four of the
chief figures in this matter of Dr. Wil
bur s continuation on leave are gradu
ates of the University. Hoover was
graduated in 1895, Wilbur in 1895,
Swain in 1899, and Cutler in 190 G.

head of the ticklish interior depart
ment, practically coextensive with that
of the present administration.
Since taking office as secretary Dr.
Wilbur has undertaken a large num
ber of significant enterprises and made
a number of important changes in af
fairs coming under his jurisdiction,
several of which are still in process of
completion. Among these are the ad
ministration of Indian affairs, the start
of the Hoover dam, with its compli
cated difficulties and the extremely
complicated and difficult control of
petroleum and natural gas production.
Interesting to Stanford men and
women is the fact that all four of the
chief figures in this matter of Dr. Wil
bur s continuation on leave are gradu
ates of the University. Hoover was
graduated in 1895, Wilbur in 1895,
Swain in 1899, and Cutler in 190 G.
