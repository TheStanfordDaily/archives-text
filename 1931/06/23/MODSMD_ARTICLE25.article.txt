# GIVE SUMMER STUDENTS A CHANCE
## 
### 
There seems to he a widespread conviction that Summer
Quarter sessions are rather .dreary affairs. A survey ot the
opinions of students who attend the regular quarters would
reveal, no doubt, a remarkable concensus of belief that summer
sessions represent the lowest ebb of university life. Even those
persons who make up the student body of summer sessions are
apt to be apologetic about attending.
That there are certain grounds for such a conviction is too
obvious to deny or evade. And yet one wonders why summer
quarters should be so lacking in that buoyancy and cararaderie
one generally associates with college life. Although there is
an abnormal number of older persons attending university in
the summer, they are, opinions to the contrary notwithstanding,
neither prudish nor stupid. Perhaps the pedagogs among them
are a little more sedate than undergraduates, due to the some
what rigorous demands of their profession, but, given the op
portunity, who knows but that they might be just as interested
in activities out of the classroom as their younger colleagues.
The point thesp remarks are leading to is that a more serious
attempt should be made to weld the students attending the
summer quarter into some semblance of a student body. Every
one would like to feel that he is a Stanford man or woman and
not just a transient boarder, even though he is here only during
the summer months. If there were more opportunity for sum
mer students to become acquainted with one another, and more
chances of showing their loyalty and "Stanford spirit" those
who now inveigh so cynically about summer students might
revise their opinions
Sorority and fraternity activities, clubs, athletics â€”these
things are missing during the summer. About all there is left
to do is study. If some individual or group would devise a way
to inject into summer sessions the life that such activities pro
vide for other quarters he or they would win the undying
gratitude of Summer Quarter students.
