# TRIPS HERE AND THERE

Inexpensive tours to points of scenic and historic interest
within a few hours' travel of the campus have been arranged
for summer quarter students. The first capitol of the state,
redwood trees, something that can be seen nowhere else on
earth except in a limited area in California,' Lick Observatory
on Mt. Hamilton, with explanation by astronomers of the won
ders to be seen through the immense telescope, the Skyline
Boulevard, with its view of valley on one side and ocean on
the other, are among the objective of these convenient Saturday
tours.
Travellers who cross the continent find it worth considerable
effort to crowd as many of these places into hurried itineraries
as they can; it would be foolish to ignore all ol them merely
because they can be visited so conveniently.
And by the same token, the Hoover home is not the only
spot worth visiting right here 011 Jhe campus, even though it
does sometimes seem the sole goal of campus visitors. I here
are graduates of Stanford who have passed four years 011 the
campus without going inside the museum. Now is an excellent
time to avoid such an bsurditv. Museum, art galleries, various
>cienlilie collections, have a good deal to offer toward an edu
cation.
