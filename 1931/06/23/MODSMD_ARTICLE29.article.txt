# At The Theatre

### Staff Reviewer 
Philip Barry seems to have found
himself in his newest play, "Tomorrow
and Tomorrow," now iif its second
week at the Curran Theatre in San
Francisco, being presented by Belasco
and Curran. This is not his usual
drawing-room comedy, but a coura
geous attempt to work out and present
a theme in which he himself believed.
It is the work of a creative artist, and
not merely of a flippant master of tech
nique.
Because of his intensity of purpose
and his attentiveness to the accuracy
of the drawing of his characters, Barry
has slipped up a bit in the actual con
struction of his play, with the result
that it lacks force and a certain desir
able continuity.
The theme is to be found in the
Old Testament, being taken from Sec
ond Kings, IV, 8-37: "And it fell on a
day, that Elishia passed to Shunem,
where there was a great woman." Eve
Redman, in the play, is just that. She
is, in the words of Dr. Nicholas Hay,
the eminent psychiatrist whom she
loves, "an artist without an art." She
was, actually, a woman without a child,
and a woman with an abundance of
that maternal instinct so heralded. She
had a pleasant enough Babbitt of a
husband whom she loved maternally.
But she had no child.
The tale goes on, and she has a mo
mentous decision to make, that of
whether to choose to stay with her
husband and the child which is Dr.
Hay's, and thus avoid breaking her
unsuspecting husband's heart, or
whether to go with the man to whom
she and the child belonged. One may
not be convinced that she chose right
ly. That is due not in the slightest to
the fault of the actors or any failure
of theirs to be convincing, but rather
to the playwright's failure to make a
play which would hang together. It is
choppy, and one leaves with an un
satisfied feeling. However, the play is
most decidedly worth while, in that it
is acted by competent actors, has ex
cellent dialogue, provides food for
thought, and its characters are worth
becoming acquainted with.
If you saw Henry Daniell's work last
season in "Death Takes A Holiday"
you will welcome a chance to see him
in this newest vehicle for his talent.
His diction is perhaps the most de
lightful feature in the entire acting of
the play, though Kay Johnson makes
a convincing and beautiful Eve, and
Leon Waycoff, new to San Francisco
audiences, handles an almost unsympa
thetic part unusually well.
One might well avoid a matinee per
formance, because of the unapprecia
tive audience that will be found. The
audience seems to have a derogatory
influence on the actors.
