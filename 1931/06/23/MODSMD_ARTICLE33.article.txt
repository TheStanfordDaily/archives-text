# DAMROSCH CONDUCTS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN WOODLAND THEATER
## Dean of Directors Thrills Audience with Music Interpretations 
### 
Walter Damrosch, dean of American
composers whose radio concerts have
won a place for him in the hearts ol
American people, came to the Wood
land theater at Hillsborough Sunday to
open the 1931 summer season of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
The master conductor was greeted not
only by the newer Damrosch enthu
siasts but by a number of his Western
friends who heard him conduct in Cali
fornia more than twenty-five years ago.
When he first lifted his baton, the
noted leader won his audience. Yet,
it was not until Shubert's "Moment
Musical" was played that the audience
thoroughly entered into the spirit oi
the music. The setting of giant trees
through which warm rays of afternoon
sun filtered, stimulated the minds of
the audience which responded to the
soft dance rhythm with a mood which
could be felt throughout the theater.
The proverbial "best for the last"
was in order Sunday afternoon. Dam
rosch closed his program with Johann
Strauss' "Roses from the South." Ap
parently wishing to share his joy of
the waltz music with his audience,
Damrosch turned half about, seeming
to lead both and auditors.
"Roses from the South" received the
largest ovation of the concert and had
the program been shorter, the master
conductor would probably have given
an encore.
Bird Aids in Concert
The duet of sounds from nature and
from art was especially harmonious in
Liszt's "St. Francis Preaching to the
Birds" which Damrosch gave a de
lightful sensitive reading. Unexpect
edly, the orchestra was aided in a
natural rendition by a bird soaring
(jverhead.
The West has heard Damrosch from
the East many times but Sunday it was
the Eastern people listening to their
radios, who enjoyed the beloved con
ductor's remarks in introducing the
"Le Roi d'ys" Overture of Lalo and
Cesar Franck's "Symphony in D
Minor."
Other selections which were inter
preted by the dean of orchestra leaders
were, "Adagio, for String Orchestra"
by Lek'eu, and Bach's "Air from D
Major Suite."
