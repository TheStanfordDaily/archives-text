Professor W. C. Perry, the designer,
states that the plan has been made as
modern as possible. There will be a
standard 440-yard oval and two
straightaways of 220 yards each. The
bleachers will accommodate 20,000 peo
ple.
Beneath the bleachers there will be
dressing rooms containing 2,000 feet of
space for the visiting teams, and an
equal, but less elaborate, space for
dressing rooms for the home teams.
The press box will be equipped with
facilities for a broadcast system, and
a public address system. There will be
a large concrete score board.
It is in this new oval that next year's
I.C. 4A try-outs will be held.
