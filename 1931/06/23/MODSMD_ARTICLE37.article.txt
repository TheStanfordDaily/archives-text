# SIGNATURES NEEDED IN CHANGING MAJORS
## 
### 
The Registrar's office is warning stu
dents who are changing their major
departments that before the change is
officially completed such students need
the signatures indicating approval of
both the department to which they are
transferring and that with which they
were formerly enrolled.
Many students have passed in peti
tions with signatures of only the de
partment to which they desire lo
change. Obtaining the approval of the
department from which transfer is be
ing requested is not merely a matter
of courtesy to those departments but is
necessary in order that department and
University records may be kept
straight. Recorder Laura Nagel is
sending written notices to all students
who have come to her attention as be
ing remiss in this requirement, and is
requesting immediate correction of the
error.
