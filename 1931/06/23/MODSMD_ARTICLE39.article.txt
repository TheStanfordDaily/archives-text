# MEXICAN OFFICIALS DETAIN STANFORD PROFS IN SOUTH
## McMurphy And Wiggins Stay Eighteen Days In Mexico On Customs Check-up 
### 
J. I. McMurphy, associate professor
of Botany, and Ira L. Wiggins, assistant
professor of Botany, are resting at their
homes in Palo Alto today, following a
recent "misunderstanding"' suffered at
the hands of Mexican officials in the
southern end of the Peninsula of Lower
California. McMurphy and Wiggins
were halted by a Mexican customs of
ficer at San Jose de Tabo and held
there for eighteen days.
According to Wiggins, jealousy on
the part of the Southern officials of
other members of the Mexican customs
staff caused his refusal to recognize the
credentials of the local professors, is
sued on their entrance to the country.
Their car confiscated, Wiggins and Mc-
Murphy were confined in their work of
investigating Lower Southern Califor
nia flora to country within walking
distance of San Jose de Tabo. They
were even forced to pay for telegrams
sent to Mexico City to check their cre
dentials, Wiggins said.
Wiggins described San Jose de Tabo
as being principally populated by a
large number of children and dogs.
Due to the long delay in their excur
sion, the botanists overstayed their
leave in the country, arriving at the
border June 6 instead of the second
when they were due. However, ac
cording to Wiggins, the Mexican offi
cials there were very apologetic and
allowed them to leave the country
without further investigation.
