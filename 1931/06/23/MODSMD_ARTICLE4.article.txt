# Representative of Arabia Tells of Sumerian City Or, Buried Near Bagdad
## 
### 
Underground near Bagdad lies the
buried city of Or, which flourished
5000 8.C., a survival of Sumerian civili
zation. Miss Emet Said of Bagdad, who
has been sent by the Arabian govern
ment to Stanford, tells of the wonder
ful articles excavated, sVich as neck
laces, bracelets, combs, and whip
handles, wrought in gold and copper,
whose workmanship is so fine that it
cannot be copied by hand today. These
relics are being put in the museum at
Bagdad, as they are discovered.
The marvels and romances of Bag
dad, according to Miss Said, do not all
lie in buried cities and crumbling ruins.
Bagdad is still a wonder place. The
Euphrates river runs through the city
and along its banks the coffee shops
with their softly colored lights are par
ticularly lovely at night. These coffee
shops are only for the men, as the
women are still confined to their own
quarters.
No Apartment Houses in Bagdad
The homes of most of the inhabitants

are also along the banks of this river.
Everyone in Bagdad lives in homes,
there being no apartment or flat build
ings, as in our cities. The houses are
unusually two stories high and each
one is built around two courts.
The smaller of the two courts may
be seen as you enter from the street
and the rooms built around it are tor
the men. No women are found here,
but it is always open for visitors, who
are not infrequent since the natives of
Bagdad are fond of callers. The inner
court is larger and the family dwells
in the rooms surrounding it.
Everyone stops work at noon, and
as the children go to school only in the
morning, the family gathers in a large
room that opens on the inner court.
The walls of this room are very thick
so as .to keep out the heat, and the
floor is made of yellow bricks. There
are fountains and fans, couches and
tables, where the noonday meal is
served.
Still an Old-World City
After luncheon every one goes to
sleep until 4 o'clock, at which time
they * again gather in another room,
opening on the inner court. Here they
receive callexs. In Bagdad, when some
one comes to call, if only for five min
utes, the host or hostess always serve
served, even if he is late for half a dozen
must never leave until the coffee is
served, even if his late for half a dozen
other engagements. To do so is a se
rious breach of etiquette.
Behind the homes are even rows of
palm trees, planted so closely together
that they form a roof of gx - een. Be
tween the palms are the orchards ?nd
the fragrance of the orange and lemon
blossoms, in the spring scents the air.
Bagdad, although it has automobiles
and electrical conveniences is still an
old-world city, land of the Arabian
Nights. On the outskirts are the smail
villages where the men of the desert
live. One may see these nomads walk
ing about the city in their long white
robes. The Moslem women of Bagdad
wear long black dresses and veils cover
their heads. The Christian women
dress similarly, only they wear colors.

with their softly colored lights are par
ticularly lovely at night. These coffee
shops are only for the men, as the
women are still confined to their own
quarters.
No Apartment Houses in Bagdad
The homes of most of the inhabitants

are also along the banks of this river.
Everyone in Bagdad lives in homes,
there being no apartment or flat build
ings, as in our cities. The houses are
unusually two stories high and each
one is built around two courts.
The smaller of the two courts may
be seen as you enter from the street
and the rooms built around it are tor
the men. No women are found here,
but it is always open for visitors, who
are not infrequent since the natives of
Bagdad are fond of callers. The inner
court is larger and the family dwells
in the rooms surrounding it.
Everyone stops work at noon, and
as the children go to school only in the
morning, the family gathers in a large
room that opens on the inner court.
The walls of this room are very thick
so as .to keep out the heat, and the
floor is made of yellow bricks. There
are fountains and fans, couches and
tables, where the noonday meal is
served.
Still an Old-World City
After luncheon every one goes to
sleep until 4 o'clock, at which time
they * again gather in another room,
opening on the inner court. Here they
receive callexs. In Bagdad, when some
one comes to call, if only for five min
utes, the host or hostess always serve
served, even if he is late for half a dozen
must never leave until the coffee is
served, even if his late for half a dozen
other engagements. To do so is a se
rious breach of etiquette.
Behind the homes are even rows of
palm trees, planted so closely together
that they form a roof of gx - een. Be
tween the palms are the orchards ?nd
the fragrance of the orange and lemon
blossoms, in the spring scents the air.
Bagdad, although it has automobiles
and electrical conveniences is still an
old-world city, land of the Arabian
Nights. On the outskirts are the smail
villages where the men of the desert
live. One may see these nomads walk
ing about the city in their long white
robes. The Moslem women of Bagdad
wear long black dresses and veils cover
their heads. The Christian women
dress similarly, only they wear colors.
Underground near Bagdad lies the
buried city of Or, which flourished
5000 8.C., a survival of Sumerian civili
zation. Miss Emet Said of Bagdad, who
has been sent by the Arabian govern
ment to Stanford, tells of the wonder
ful articles excavated, sVich as neck
laces, bracelets, combs, and whip
handles, wrought in gold and copper,
whose workmanship is so fine that it
cannot be copied by hand today. These
relics are being put in the museum at
Bagdad, as they are discovered.
The marvels and romances of Bag
dad, according to Miss Said, do not all
lie in buried cities and crumbling ruins.
Bagdad is still a wonder place. The
Euphrates river runs through the city
and along its banks the coffee shops
with their softly colored lights are par
ticularly lovely at night. These coffee
shops are only for the men, as the
women are still confined to their own
quarters.
