# STANFORD STAR WINS MILE SWIMMING RACE
## 
### 
Ted Wiget, one of Stanford's ::lar
aquatic performers, won the Pacific As
sociation's one-mile race from a field
of twenty-one starters at Healdsburg
on the Russian River last Sunday. The
time, 21 minutes 43 4-5 seconds, was
made in a field of prominent Northern
California swim stars.
The Stanford merman was swimming
under the colors of the Athens Club.
As Wiget is a sprinter his victory came
as a surprise in the longer race. Jimmy
Triola, also of the Athens Club, was
second, and Frank Mooney of 11n-
Olympic Club, finished third. Triola
was only two yards behind the Stan
ford flash at the finish.
