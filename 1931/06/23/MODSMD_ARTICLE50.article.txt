# HELVENSTON ATTENDS DIRECTORS' MEETING AT NORTHWESTERN U
## Relationship of University To Professional Work In Dramatics Studied 
### 
Harold Helvenston, director of dra- |
matics at Stanford, returned yesterday
from Evanston, Illinois, where he at
tended a conference of university and
Little Theatre directors. Northwestern
University acted as host to the confer
ence, which was backed by- the Car- I
negie Corporation, and organized and |
headed by Kenneth Macgowan. Mr. j
Helvenston was one of the thirty or j
more directors of university theaters !
or Little Theatres, whom Mr. Mac
gowan called into conference with him.
The purpose of the conference, as
stated by Mr. Helvenston, was "to dis
cuss the relationship between univer
sity and Little Theatre dramatics, and
professionalism; to lay a foundation for j
a national theater outside of and inde- j
pendent of Broadway." The directors j
in conference discussed plays and the 1
problems a director meets in having to j
wait two or three years to obtain the
rights to plays running on Broadway. !
It was agreed that it is both necessary j
break away from a hampering depend- j
ence upon Broadway for plays. The
conference has as another ideal, the I
establishing of a bureau for the dis- |
pensing of specific information as re- j
gards its work.
The West was represented at the con- |
ference by Mr. Helvenston, Gilmore !
Brown of the" Pasadena Community 1
Playhouse, with his manager, Waiter
Prickett, and by Alice Brainerd from I
the Berkeley Playhouse. Other uni
versities which were represented by j
their directors were Wisconsin, Michi- |
gan, lowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Ken- !
tucky, Arizona, and others. Little Thea- I
tre groups from Cleveland, Atlanta, and j
Louisville sent representatives.
Notable among the delegates were I
Hallie Flanigan, director of the Vassal' i
experimental theater, Edith J. R. Isaacs, I
editor of Theatre Arts Monthly, and |
Thomas Woods Stevens, formerly head j
of the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. I
