# SUMMER SCHOOL OF CREATIVE EDUCATION OPENS IN MENLO PARK
## 
### 
Opening July 6 at Menlo Park, the
Summer Workshop at the Peninsula
School of Creative Education will start
its vacation scholastic session with a
large number of adults of the com
munity enrolled.
Activities for this session include
pottery modeling, glazing, firing, car
pentry, metal work, jewelry, block
printing, figure drawing, outdoor
sketching, creative writing, poetry,
choral, folk dancing, dramatics, discus
sions, and lectures on modern poets
and music appreciation. Four evening
lectures on education will be given.
The Summer Workshop for Adults
was started as an experiment in an in
formal type of adult education, its pur
pose being re-creation, declared Mrs.
Josephine Duveneck, director of the
school. "Through the rhythm of clay,
the joy of creating beauty with one's
hands, the comradeship of singing and
dancing together, the stimulus of tree
discussion, new avenues of capacity
and dormant talents are revived," she
stated." The founders of the school used
as a guiding principle the belief that
too much emphasis has been placed on
the mere acquisition of information and
not enough upon the ability to apply
knowledge to actual life situations,"
concluded Mrs. Duveneck.
The school is located on the old Cole
man estate in the suburbs of Menlo
Park.
The Workshop will be open five days
a week from 9 until 4 and on evenings
from 7:30 to 9:30 except Monday and
Saturday. Excursions to places of his
toric or scenic value have been planned
for Saturdays. Directors for the sum
mer include Mrs. Josephine Duveneck,
Frank Duveneck, Dorothy Mecabe,
Mary Deirup, and Helen Moore.
