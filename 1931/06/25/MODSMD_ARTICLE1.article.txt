# NEW PROSPERITY SEEN AS RESULT OF HOOVER PLAN
## Eventual Cancellation of War Debts Predicted By Professor Macy Stock Exchange Prices and Shares Soar at Hint Of Moratorium 
### 
That President Hoover's proposed
debt moratorium is a long step in the
right direction is the opinion of Dr.
C. W. Macy, visiting professor of Eco
nomics from Coe College, lowa. "It is
the application of firm business prin
ciples to international affairs," he told
a reporter for The Stanford Dailj^.

"The President's plan will postpone
for a year the war debt payments of all
nations," Macy said. "It is designed to
relieve Germany of the crushing bur
den of reparations and give her a
breathing spell. This plan will tend to
stimulate sound industrial progression
in all countries, especially throughout
the exporting industries, strengthen the
economic status of the debtor states,
and go far in rendering them capable of
withstanding the pressure of repara
tions payments."
Germany is struggling under the
heavy demands of the Young Plan, he
declared. She is harassed by com
munism and fascism. Her political un
rest is accentuated by economic dis
tress and the thorn of excessive taxa
tion. The collapse of the republic would
threaten the foundations of Europe, and
inflict tremendous losses upon all coun
tries doing business with her.
Will Stimulate Trade
Professor Macy believes that the
President's proposal is designed to di
vert the millions of dollars now being
wrung from the debtor nations into
industrial channels. The stimulation of
international trade which he believes
will follow, will be of intense benefit
to every country participating.

"The moratorium is in line with the
theories of a host of economists and
political scientists," he continued, "who
for the past ten years have been plead
ing for the cancellation, or at least the
reduction, of the war debts. Although
President Hoover has emphatically de
clared that he does not intend to cancel
any of the debt, I think that the re
sults of the moratorium may merit se
rious consideration of that question.'
Stock Quotations Rise
Last Saturday the mere hint of such
a plan sent the New York Stock Ex
change quotations upward. This sen
sitive financial barometer disclosed a
heavy increase in both the number of
shares exchanged, and in the prices of
the shares. The exporting industries,
and the products with foreign markets
were especially active. Yesterday the
stock quotations were still climbing.
"The rise on the Exchange is mainly
a psychological reaction," said Macy.
"The actual improvement of the eco
nomic status of these industries does
not merit such rises in price. However,
if the proposal is adopted, American
industries should experience a wider
range of foreign payable markets."
He swung his chair about so that his
back was toward the open window,
leaving his face a shadowed outline,'
and continued:
U.S. Attitude More Liberal
"For the last ten years many econo
mists have advocated the cancellation
of war debts as an economic measure.
This plan is directed along that line. I
have believed for a long time that a
more liberal attitude on the part of the
United States toward the Allied war
debt payments should be followed. The
present economic strife in European
and American nations demands atten
tion. Hoover's moratorium is a big
step in the right direction, and I am
hopeful that it will indicate complete
cancellation of all war debts.
