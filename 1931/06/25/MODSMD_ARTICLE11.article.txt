# Damrosch to Give Last Concert Sunday
## Program at Hillsborough to Feature Wagner 
### 
Walter Damrosch, beloved American
composer and symphony conductor,
will give his second and last concert
in the Woodland Theater at Hills
borough next Sunday afternoon at 3
o'clock. His appearance last Sunday
as guest conductor at the opening con
cert of the series, attracted a record
breaking crowd.

New to local music-lovers will be
GlazoUnow's "Symphony No. 5 in B
flat," which will be the symphonic of
fering of the afternoon. "Pavane" by
Faux-e, and "Entrance of the Little
Fauns" by Pierne, are novelties, and
are being presented for the first time
at these concerts. The former is an
orchestration of early dance music and
the latter a grotesque little march, a
delightful exerpt from the ballet, "Cy
dalise and the Satyr."
The second half of the program will
be awaited with anticipation by music
lovers who know that Damrosch has
no peer in the interpretation of Wag
nerian music dramas, for Wagnerian
music comprises the entire and larger
second half. The numbers to be played
will include the "Prelude" from "Lo
hengrin," and that also of "Die Meis
tersinger"; the "Prelude" and "Liebes
tod" from "Tristan and Isolde," and
the "Processional of the Gods" from
the last scene of "Das Rheingold."
The opportunity to hear the music
of these great German operas, directed
by a master who is thoroughly familiar
with their traditions will doubtless call
out a crowd comparable to that of last
Sunday and re-enforces the warning
to Stanford music lovers to be on hand
early if they would be sure of seats.
