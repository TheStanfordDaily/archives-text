Jacobsen, Stanford faculty members,
were among the six California educa

Foundation. The award allows each
man six months study in Europe.
Dr. Parks, who is associate professor
of chemistry, will leave for Europe
during the eaijly part of December to
make extensive research in the study nf
thermo-chemistry, a subject on which
he is an authority.
Dr. Jacobsen, assistant mechanical
engineering professor, has already left
for Europe, where he expects to re
main until September.
Dr. Jacobsen will pay particular at
tention to the amazing progress which
has been made by the German sci
entists in his field.
Thermo-chemistry, which deals with
heat effect on organic compounds, has
reached highest development in the
University of Leyden, in Holland,
where lowest temperatures ever known
have been brought about. It is Dr.
Parks' intention to spend the major
part of his time in the Leyden labora
tories in study of the European meth
