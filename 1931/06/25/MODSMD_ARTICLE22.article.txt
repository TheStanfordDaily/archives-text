rienced actor, according to student
critics.

of Anna, the MayorV ambitious and
very charming wife, has not yet been
j chosen.
David Dickey, whose splendid work
as Matthew Grindle, Chancellor of the

all, a pompous, stupid hypocrite, pos
ing as a righteous man.
Henry Kleinbach, who has worked
1 with the Pasadena Community Players,
i will play the part of Fillipovitch, a po
' litical rogue.
Comedy Team Is Named

I Hlestakov.

The ti'youts were most successful, no

i and the material of high quality. These
i tryouts had a purpose other than se

! years ago, and who played a major
part in Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh," Jean
Peddicord, a promising newcomer, and
Jacqueline DeWit, who is new also
to the Stanford stage. Marion Little
field will be the maid.
A comedy team is to be composed
of two actors, Boyd Homewood, who
1 played two years ago as Mr. One in
| "The Adding-Machine," and Carey
| Odell. They will be Dobchinsky, lisping
; landowner, and Bobchinsky. These two
j are eavesdroppers, yes-men to the
! mayor, scandal-spreaders, newsmon
| gers, comical weaklings who act mys
| teriously and apprehensively when in
danger. Joseph Whitakcr, who has had
j some work in drama, will play Osip,
lazy and shiftless personal servant to
I Hlestakov.
Other roles have not been cast, but
; will be chosen tonight.
The ti'youts were most successful, no
cording to Harold Helvenston, director,
i and the material of high quality. These
i tryouts had a purpose other than se
| lecting those to play the parts in I lie
first play. They gave an excellent
chance to survey the material for the
| next play, which will be cast and put
1 into rehearsal as soon as the present
one has been produced, declared Hel
! venston.
Director Helvenston asks that all
students who did not receive parts in
; "The Inspector-General" should try out
I for the second play, which will be of an
j entirely different type.
Paul Spoegle will play the part of
, Ivan Alexandrovitch Helstakov, a dan
dy from Petersburg, in the first play
i of the summer, Gogol's "The Inspector -
1 General," to be presented in the As
sembly Hall on July 10. Hlestakov is
| a charming four-flusher, a poised and
delightful deceiver, and a devil with
the ladies.
Speegle is well-known to Stanford
audiences for excellent work in past
campus productions, most outstanding
| among these being "The Swan," "The
Ivory Door," and "Mrs. Bumpstead-
Leigh." Capable and entertaining
work may be expected in the handling
of this role, for it is delightful as writ
ten, and is in the hands of an expe
rienced actor, according to student
critics.
