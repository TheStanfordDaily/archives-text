# "LEADERS" FACE OBSTACLES
## 
### 
A large group of school men attending Stanford litis summer
heard a speaker at a luncheon meeting yesterday, charge them
with being somewhat short-sighted in their leadership. Ihe
speaker made the quite indisputable point that schools should
lead and not follow or merely keep abreast oi the times. His
conclusion, which no doubt sounded familiar to many, was that
school administrators, recognizing the conditions oi modern
life, should change their programs to meet those conditions.
The majority of Ihe school men listening to this speaker
were, no doubt, administrators of some sort or other. Attending
the University this summer for one reason or another and away
from Ihe pressure of local conditions, these men can listen to
such proposals, discuss them, let their minds play with them.
Although the speaker proposed nothing that could be con
strued as radical, it may very well he that the school men who
heard him found themselves mulling over a good many radical
ideas and impracticable possibilities as an outcome ot what he
said. If they have such inclinations, personally, they can, here
on this campus, go as far as they like in such pleasant mental
occupation, reconstructing the whole educational system â€”in
their imagination.
Hut well these men know, if university professors sometimes
do not, that back 011 the job the situation changes. More prac
tical considerations such as how to stretch the inexorable budget
to meet existing demands and how to pacify and keep pacified
antagonistic groups of taxpayers, occupy about all the adminis
trator's time and ability.
Although school men of the sort who attend summer quarter
sessions are in sympathy with most progressive trends in edu
cation, their problem is one of much greater complexity than
just learning what the progressive tendencies and modern ideas
are. Theirs is the task of putting those ideas into operation.
Theories which sound plausible in the classroom often take on
another aspect when they are presented to a hard-headed school
board or a tax-laden school district.
Let critics of our educational system forbear, then, until they
have investigated actual working conditions. And that does not
mean that school administrators do not have their quota of reac
tionaries and timid stand-patters. But considering their relative
insecurity of tenure and the fact that they are subject to nearly
the same fluctuations of public opinion that politicians are, per
haps they are not so backward after all.
