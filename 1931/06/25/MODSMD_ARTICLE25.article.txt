# PAYMENT CAN'T BE ESCAPED
##

The Sacramento lice in an editorial yesterday denounced
President Hoover's moratorium plan under the heading—
"America Again Asked to Pay for Europe's Folly."
What the Bee lias failed to see is that Hoover's plan does
not cancel the debt, hut only suspends preparation and debt
payments for one year.
France and Germany have been the most bitter enemies for
years and now that France is willing to forgive Germany her
reparation payments, she is not doing il out of any love for Ger
many, but for purely selfish economic reasons that will help
France.
The Bee fails to see what France shows she lias seen—that
national prosperity is directly affected by international pros
perity.
When Europe is prosperous, that prosperity affects the
I'liiled States, and when their stocks go up, our stocks go up.
