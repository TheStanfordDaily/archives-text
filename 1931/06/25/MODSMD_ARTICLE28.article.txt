A Russian brake invented for use
on railroad trains was tried out in
Georgia last week and failed to work.
What joy this will bring to the driver
who likes to beat the locomotive to
the crossing. The old game will still
have its thrills.
"I like practical jokes," says Billy
Moran, "and I think the best one was
invented by the man who introduced
lawn-mowers."
If Mexico could only be made safe,
it might become a great winter resort
for Americans. Then the Mexican
bandits could become hotel keepers.
For she was a Paly woman,
And he a Stanford man, —
It was during the summer session,
That each acquired a coat of tan,
And all the professors' wives said,
"Oh, what a disgrace . .
For each was sunburned
On the opposite side of the facc.
Headline in Daily says "SUMMER
QUARTER CO-EDS FIND NEW GYM
NASIUM HERE." It's quite possible
the same co-eds might find a few other
buildings, too, if they look real hard.
Now about these kindergartens
that seem to have sprung up in
several of the fraternity houses
since last quarter. It's nice to see
the little tots gamboling on the
lawns with their toys and baseballs.
It reminds us so much of last quar
ter. Except that none of these
youngsters smoke pipes while they
play.
Even meaner than the boys who push
little ducks into the water and then
don't let them swim, are the D.U.'s
who have turned the House of D'Up
silon into a kindergarten. Burning cats
and squalling children We're moving
our mattress and corkscrew into an
other neighborhood,
A nasheous verse dedicated to those
who think so.
Due to the fact that we do not
have enough white corpuscles
In the blood which flows around in
our muscles,
We find to our extreme horror that
disease,
Malignant and terrible, is on the
increase.
NOW THAT OUR FATHERS ARE
GOING AWAY ON THEIR VACA
TIONS, THEY WILL GET AN IDEA
OF HOW HARD IT IS TO LOAF
THROUGH FOUR YEARS.
The height of irony was to give fath
er a billfold for Fathers' Day.
It is reported that the gravediggers
are on a strike for higher wages, which
means that the cost of dying is going
up along with the cost of living. Now,
what will become of the ultimate con
sumer?

For those who take dates to jolly ups
I cannot sing of eyes of blue,
Because her eyes are green.
Her hair is of a golden hue.
But it has no silken sheen.
Her neck is shapely as a swan's
But ne'er was it so white.
However, be that as it may
She looks damn good at night.

THEN THERE IS THE CASE OF
THE PROFESSOR WHO STARTED
TO DIG FISHING WORMS THE
OTHER DAY AND ABSENT-MIND
EDLY SPADED UP THE WHOLE
GARDEN.

our mattress and corkscrew into an
other neighborhood,
A nasheous verse dedicated to those
who think so.
Due to the fact that we do not
have enough white corpuscles
In the blood which flows around in
our muscles,
We find to our extreme horror that
disease,
Malignant and terrible, is on the
increase.
NOW THAT OUR FATHERS ARE
GOING AWAY ON THEIR VACA
TIONS, THEY WILL GET AN IDEA
OF HOW HARD IT IS TO LOAF
THROUGH FOUR YEARS.
The height of irony was to give fath

It is reported that the gravediggers
are on a strike for higher wages, which
means that the cost of dying is going
up along with the cost of living. Now,
what will become of the ultimate con

For those who take dates to jolly ups
I cannot sing of eyes of blue,
Because her eyes are green.
Her hair is of a golden hue.
But it has no silken sheen.
Her neck is shapely as a swan's
But ne'er was it so white.
However, be that as it may
She looks damn good at night.

THEN THERE IS THE CASE OF

If Mexico could only be made safe,
it might become a great winter resort
for Americans. Then the Mexican
bandits could become hotel keepers.
For she was a Paly woman,

Now about these kindergartens

several of the fraternity houses
since last quarter. It's nice to see
the little tots gamboling on the

It reminds us so much of last quar

Even meaner than the boys who push
