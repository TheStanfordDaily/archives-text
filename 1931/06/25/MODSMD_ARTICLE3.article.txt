Material for the quarterly publica
tion officially known as the University
Directory but more generally familiar
as the Bawlout is being sent to the
printer and the pamphlet will probably
be completed and issued in not over
a week.
The Registrar's office calls the atten
tion of students and faculty to the fact
that any changes of address, office
hours, or other matters that appear
in the directory that have been made
since the beginning of the quarter
should be sent to that office at once if
they are to appear in the printed
volume.

Correct residence location and post
office addresses, the Registrar points
out, frequently save much time in lo
cating students in emergencies. Many
students were unable to give their per
manent addresses for the quarter tft
the time they registered, and they are
requested to supply that information
at once so that it may be included in
the Directory. There will be no gen
eral notice of time of publication and
no proofs will be posted for correction,
but the book will be completed and
rushed through by the yniversity
Press as soon as the Registi'ar's office
can complete the last of the data and
turn it over.
