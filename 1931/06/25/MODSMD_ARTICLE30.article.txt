SEED—At the California Theater, May
field.
A lovely wife and a charming "sec
ond" lady strive for a man's love, and
his children win. If it is possible for a
love-triangle to involve truly fine sen
timents, this talkie taken from a best
seller of the same name by Charles
Norris accomplishes that end.
John Boles as the ambitious writer
and father of fine strapping youngsters
and Lois Wilson as the adoring and
self-sacrificing wife each do an excel
lent job of difficult characterization.
Genevieve Tobin is thoroughly con
vincing as the beautiful husband
stealer. In fact, she almost makes you
like it. Zazu Pitts makes all too infre
quent appearances in her usual role of
the maid.
The picture is shown for the last
times tonight.
DADDY LONG LEGS—At the New
Stanford.
The program says "You'll laugh, |
you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll sigh."
You do, with most emphasis on the
"laugh." Janet Gaynor brings a more
lovable, more cheerful Judie Abbott !
than we had imagined possible. The j
silent version of this great romance j
and the book itself stressed the drab
life at the orphan asylum, as we re- !
member it. Miss Gaynor makes the
story happier, and makes us like it
all the better.
Warner Baxter gives us a mighty fine
"Daddy Long Legs," handling all the
situations with much poise, especially '
in the instance when he joins the kids j
in a game of football and gets thrown '
for a big loss and finds himself at the !
bottom of a pyramid of squirming I
bodies, arms, and Tegs.
John Arledge, a newcomer to the
screen, plays the part of the college ,
"pal" of Judie. He's a handsome young j
devil and a good humorist. You'll like ;
him.

FIVE AND TEN—At the Varsity Thea
ter.
Marion Davies again does a good
piece of acting in a mediocre show, j
The plot is trite and the dialogue is .
not scintilating enough to lift the i
whole thing above the pale of drab
ness. The story involves the family of
a Five and Ten-Cent king who is too
involved in his business to pay any at
tention to his wife and children. The j
wife—by the way, Irene Rich 5/ does a
nice job here—gets young ideas and j
sips generously from the bitter-sweet \
cup of night life, the daughter falls in
love with a married man, and the son J
commits suicide in an airplane crash, j
A extraordinarially good Movie-tone
livens up the program.
The Polish minister of finance has j
decreed the closing of 1,155 saloons in !
Poland.
