# DECLARES CALIFORNIA TEACHERS MUST LEAD SCHOOL DEVELOPMENT
## Columbia Professor Says That School Systems Must Coordinate With Industry 
### 
That California school men must ]
take the lead in developing school sys- |
tems to meet the needs of modern in- |
dustrial life is the belief of Dr. John j
Norton, Stanford, '16, professor of !
School Administration at Teachers' j
College, Columbia, who spoke before |
the Education Club at their first regular
meeting Wednesday noon. Nflrton was 4
introduced to the large group of edu
cators assembled by Dr. E. P. Cubber
ley.
In introducing his subject, "Educa
tional Leadership in the Present Eco- j
nomic Depression," Norton declared
that educators should not let present !
conditions blind them to the problems j
of the future. "We should look beyond I
this year's budget," he said, "to the \
needs of our communities and the na
tion in five or ten years. Educators
should see the needs of the future and
plan for them."-

After pointing out several ways in j
which conditions of today are produc- j
ing problems which must be faced by j
the schools, Norton stated that educa- j
tional leaders must have a broader i
conception of the place of the school !
in its relation to other phases of otir |
civilization than they now have. He J
continued by saying that the school i
should be thought of as more of a co
ordinating agency in the community j
than it now is.
"Fifty or sixty years from now adult j
education will be the center on which j
the wheel of education will spin," de- j
clared Norton. "The reason for this |
lies in the fact that our civilization is j
becoming increasingly complex. One ]
cannot be expected to learn all that it i
is necessary to know in the customary, j
eight or twelve years of school."
Adults Learn More Rapidly
Norton pointed out that adult educa
tion is feasible because recent investi
gations have shown that adults learn
much more rapidly than children. He
went 011 to explain that learning must
not stop at the level it now does be
cause of the tremendous expansion of
knowledge and because of vocational
needs.
Norton won fame during his under
graduate days at Stanford as a track
star. He was a hurdler, representing
the United States at the Olympic games j
in 1920.

That California school men must ]
take the lead in developing school sys- |
tems to meet the needs of modern in- |
dustrial life is the belief of Dr. John j
Norton, Stanford, '16, professor of !
School Administration at Teachers' j
College, Columbia, who spoke before |
the Education Club at their first regular
meeting Wednesday noon. Nflrton was 4
introduced to the large group of edu
cators assembled by Dr. E. P. Cubber
ley.
In introducing his subject, "Educa
tional Leadership in the Present Eco- j
nomic Depression," Norton declared
that educators should not let present !
conditions blind them to the problems j
of the future. "We should look beyond I
this year's budget," he said, "to the \
needs of our communities and the na
tion in five or ten years. Educators
should see the needs of the future and
plan for them."-
Broader Conception Needed
After pointing out several ways in j
which conditions of today are produc- j
ing problems which must be faced by j
the schools, Norton stated that educa- j
tional leaders must have a broader i
conception of the place of the school !
in its relation to other phases of otir |
civilization than they now have. He J
continued by saying that the school i
should be thought of as more of a co
ordinating agency in the community j
than it now is.
"Fifty or sixty years from now adult j
education will be the center on which j
the wheel of education will spin," de- j
clared Norton. "The reason for this |
lies in the fact that our civilization is j
becoming increasingly complex. One ]
cannot be expected to learn all that it i
is necessary to know in the customary, j
eight or twelve years of school."
Adults Learn More Rapidly
Norton pointed out that adult educa
tion is feasible because recent investi
gations have shown that adults learn
much more rapidly than children. He
went 011 to explain that learning must
not stop at the level it now does be
cause of the tremendous expansion of
knowledge and because of vocational
needs.
Norton won fame during his under
graduate days at Stanford as a track
star. He was a hurdler, representing
