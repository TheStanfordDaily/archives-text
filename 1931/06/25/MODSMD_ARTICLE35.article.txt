# COMMANDER BRYANT TALKS TO CLASS ON FLEET MANAGEMENT
## 
### 
Lieutenant Commander Stewart F.
Bryant, U.S.N., retired, who has been
carrying on special studies at Stanford
for some time in connection with his
position in the navy, spoke yesterday
before the class in Education 268 on
"Administration in the Fleet."
"Administration to the navy is very
important, in fact, a matter of life and
death. The organization of the navy
must be such that all work in harmony.
Only by following twenty broad prin
ciples of administration can such har
mony be obtained," Bryant declared.
He stressed the realization of the great
value of creative instinct and democ
racy at the U.S. Naval Academy at An
napolis.
In contrasting navy and university
administration Bryant brought forth
two great differences which he believed
universities would do well to adopt.
The first is that of having a planning
commission, which has become an es
sential and necessary part of the navy;
while the second is that of bridging
the gulf which occurs between school
teachers and students.
In concluding, Bryant startled the ed
ucators with the prediction that civili
zation in the United States will far
exceed that achieved in Europe, as we
are not battle worn. He also declared
that the time is coming when the
United States will have an opportunity
to do more for the world than any
other people; but we can only do this
after we educate men for public service
as does Great Britain. "Education is
the greatest game in the world," Bry
ant said, and concluded, "I am sorry
that I didn't get into it myself."
Bryant is here at Stanford for the
summer doing special work for the
government. He has also attended the
Naval Academy at Annapolis and Rob
erts College at Constantinople.
