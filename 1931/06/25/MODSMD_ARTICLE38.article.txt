# HALL JANITORS ARE SET FOR SUMMER'S WORK
## Sponsors Speak Too Soon; Frosh Class Really Wild YEARLING STUDENTS CLOSE STAY IN BLAZE 
### 
j Now that Spring Quarter is over and
I the class of '34 has moved out of En
l cina Hall, the janitors have resigned
| themselves to the task of cleaning up
I the old fortress. It is impossible even
to even to enter some of the rooms
| and closets because they have been
nailed shut.
According to Bertram A. Gage, cus- |
i todian, it will take a crew of mechanics i
| and janitors a good summer to put the |
j hall in order for the class of '35.
"The Sponsors spoke too soon when j
they said that this year's Freshman j
' class was not up to the wild standards j
j of classes a couple of years back,'' said j
Sponsor Vard Loomis. The present j
class started out meek and quiet. It j
ended the year in such a blaze of glory J
that the campus fire department got j
several good work-outs on bull pen j
bonfires composed of "junker" cars and j
discarded mattresses. '
"If the janitors had had anything to i
say on the matter of conferring of de- '
j grees they would have given an Engi- j
neering Master's to the Freshman who j
invented a suction fan that keep the ;
flies and dust out of his room," one j
i man declared. The fan went into re- j
verse one day, and the room looked !
' like a Hollywood production of a sand I
I storm. The hall vote went to the in- \
,ventor of the lock that was guai'anteed
J to keep sponsors out.
Like all first-class hotels, Encina was
troubled with cooking in the rooms.
The objection lay not in the ant haz
ard, but in the fire hazard. Small elec
tric ranges played havoc with the old i
fuses and ancient wiring system, and
many a night an entire wing had to j
study in the library or go to bed in i
the dark.
The economic depression seems to 1
have been felt at Encina and conse
quently there is not as much first-class
junk left behind as in former year's, j
This year an article was looked at 1
twice before it went out through a
window.
Mike Doudoroff of the Mathematics I
Department was not busy Saturday j
afternoon and helped work out a few
statistics and comparisons on the rub- j
bish and damage that is credited to
the class of '34, as follows:
It would take three good cows six
and a half days to produce enough
milk to fill all the milk bottles thrown !
into the bull pen.
If all the radio aerials in Encina were
made into one telephone line, it would
stretch from Palo Alto to San Carlos.
Enough hay and mattresses were j
burned to run a steam locomotive and
six loaded freight cars from San Fran- |
cisco to Kansas City. If the ruined (ur- I

niture was used for fuel, the train
could continue its run to Chicago.
Enough water was thrown out the
windows to float a Red Stack tug in 1
] eight feet of water.
The entire Congressional Record for I
! 1916 and 1917 could be printed on the i
! paper found in the hallways.
If all the old laundry bags were cut
| into three foot squares, there would be
! enough cloths to clean every car 6n
j the campus.
