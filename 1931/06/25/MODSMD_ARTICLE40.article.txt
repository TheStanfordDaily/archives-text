"JOHN MISTLETOE"—By Christopher
Morley. Doubleday and Doran. Ciar
den City Press, New York. 1931.
Morley is writing here his autobi
ography, if at 40 years a rambling re
flection on the nature of things in gen
eral and the adventures and delights
of John Mistletoe in particular, can be
called an autobiography. "John Mistle
toe" is the name Morley gives himself,
though he makes no further attempt at
disguise of his identity.
The thing is chronological enough to
satisfy, though one is scarcely aware
of moving events, only of a life being
lived out. Mistletoe went to Haverford
College in Pennsylvania, was a Rhodes
scholar, then printer's devil for Dou
bleday, Page and Company, finally be
came an actual journalist and found
himself conducting a signed column on
the editorial page of the old New York
Evening Post. With Henry Seidel Can
by he founded the Saturday Review of
Literature. Exciting adventures with
the Old Rialto in Hoboken followed as
a sort of intermission of play. Then
come England and Shakespearian in
vestigations. And all the time he was
writing for this or that.
If ever Christopher Morley found
life to be a horrible or tragic or de
spairing affair, we have no indication
of it in this "mind-hunt." There are
some who would prefer a dash of cyn
icism, but there are too many cynics
and too few John Mistletoes already in
this world. And what if he did find
the little exquisite things in living true
and beautiful and full o*f meaning? We
have the Russians for cynicism and
painful realities. We have Christopher
Morley and his confreres for the things
the Russians couldn't know. And yet
there is an amazing depth to the thing.
Morley finds it his business to admire
life and to love it. It is significant that
in his looking back over forty years
he should find so much of delight and
beauty to record, and such a lack of
bitterness.
