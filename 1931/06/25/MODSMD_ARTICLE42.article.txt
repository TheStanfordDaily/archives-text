# POPULAR DISTRUST OF LAW ANALYZED BY PROF. MAX RADIN
## Tuesday Talk by Professor of Law Tells Cause of Legal Animosity 
### 
Undecipherable, mystifying legal jar
gon, and high lawyer's fees were speci
fied as two concrete causes for the
popular distrust of law as a profession
by Professor Max Radin of the Sum
mer Quarter faculty, in his lecture,
"The People and the Law," given Tues
day night in the Little Theatre. Radin
is professor of law at the University
of California.
"There will continue to be friction
between the people and the law as a
profession as long as the former con
tinues to regard law as a vague sub
ject," declared Professor Radin. He
compared this to the historic strife be
tween laity and clergy, in each instance
it being a case of a limited informed
group versus an unlimited, uninformed
mass.

"People confuse law and justice. They
forget that justice cannot be dealt
without some sort of legal procedure,
and this procedure must of necessity
be highly organized to conform with
our modern intricate civilization," de
clared Professor Radin.
As an illustration of law gibberish,
Professor Radin read two lengthy pages
indicting a man for murder. The same
indictment he then read in three lines
of ordinary English.

"And yet this same 'law English' has
evolved phrase by phrase for purely
humane purposes as a reaction from
the time when justice was meted out
with no courteous formality or delay
by which the defendant might have
profited," declared Professor Radin.
"It is interesting and surprising to
note that the subject matter of the la
gal profession is held higher in the
esteem of the people than that of any
other profession, and yet the lawyer
is respected the least of all professional
men."
