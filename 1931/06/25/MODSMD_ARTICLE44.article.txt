# MOFFATT'S INJURED LEG O.K. FOR FALL
## 
### 
A broken leg suffered in spring foot
hall practice has forced Phil Moflatt,
Stanford grid star, to take additional
work in the Summer Quarter. He will
be eligible for "Pop" Warner's varsity
next season, however.
Moffatt is still on crutches, which he
expects to discard by July 3. His leg
is responding rapidly to treatment and
he says he will be ready for next sea
son. The injury kept him out of classes
last quarter and he was unable to ful
fill the required number of hours.
