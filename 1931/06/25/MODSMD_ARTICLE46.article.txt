# CHAMBER TO HOLD ELEVENTH ANNUAL SCHOOL ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
The United States Chamber of Com
merce will hold its Eleventh Annual
School for Commercial Secretaries here
from July Bth to 12th, inclusive, with
Professor J. Hugh Jackson of the Grad
uate School of Business, serving as
academic director.
The Western School will offer twen
ty-eight courses featuring the organi
zation, operation and economic prob
lems of the modern chamber of com
merce. The courses are to be taught
by men who are acknowledged experts
in their fields and who have planned
their instructions so as to aid the sec
retaries in the solution of some of the
problems peculiar to the West.
Dr. Willard E. Hotchkiss, dean of the
Graduate School of Business, is one of
the lecturers, and will conduct a class
dealing with the scientific approach to
executive problems, and of co-opera
tion of the chambers of commerce with
business.
During the week of instruction the
delegates will be housed at Branner
Hall. They will elect officers and com
mittee heads for necessary business,
and a committee for the publication of
the daily, "Good Morning," which is
to be delivered with the breakfast com
fee.
Another such school for the efficient
training of commercial secretaries has
been held annually by the National
Chamber at Northwestern University.
But recognizing the difficulty and ex
pense to western cities in schooling
their men at the Eastern institution, the
National officials founded the Western
School here eleven years ago.
Applications for enrollment, or other
communications should be addressed
to Leonard E. Read, Business Manager,
321 Chamber of Commerce Building,
Seattle, Washington.
