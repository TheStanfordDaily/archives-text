### 
"The happy attitude and cordiality
of the student body this summer has
impressed me singularly," said Profes
sor Hollis Partridge Allen, when intei
viewed today. "It is good to hear the
'hello's' called throughout the campus
and feel the fine spirit of hospitality."
Allen is assistant professor of educa
tion at Claremont Colleges.
While Allen received his Master of
Arts degree at Stanford in 1925, this
is his first visit to the University as a
member of the staff. He is now as
sistant superintendent and director of
child welfare and research in the San
Bernardino City Schools and also an
instructor in the Education Depart
ment of Pomona College, and assistant
professor of education in Claremont
College.
One of the interesting experiments
sponsored by Claremont Colleges and
Pomona College is the Inter-America
Institute, which is now an entirely in
dependent organization, sufficiently en
dowed by men in California and the
Southwest, for the development of mu
tually intelligent relations between
American people, particularly between
the United States and Mexico, accord
ing to Allen. The Inter-America Insti
tute fosters friendly relations by en
couraging travel, and arranging for
speakers and professors to come to the
United States from foreign countries.
Through its efforts, according to
Professor Allen, a good many profes
sors and students from Mexico are
studying in this country, while a large
number of U.S. students are continu
ing their education in Mexico.
