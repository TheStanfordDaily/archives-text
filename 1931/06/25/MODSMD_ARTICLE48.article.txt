# STUDENT GUIDE TOURISTS WHO CLAIM MOSAICS MOVE ON MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
That there is no great eye in the !
Stanford Memorial Chapel, and that i
neither are there any mosaic pictures I
which will appear to move if one looks |
at them long enough, is part of the in- I
formation student guides find it neces- 1
sary to give curious tourists, who labor j
under such mis-apprehensions.
Every day from 9 to 5 o'clock Edwin '
I Gerhardt and James Walker are at the !
j Memorial Arch to direct visitors, and j
I to answer their questions. This service '
aids both the visiting tourists and the !
I registrar's office, which would have to j
answer all questions were there no j
guides. It is Gerhardt whose duty it is '
to conduct visiting parties through the '
I chapel. He has a sterotyped list of true ,
' facts and figures to give out.
The information is provided by Ihe
registrar's office in an effort to prevent
such repetition of freak statements as
are too often heard. A short resume j
1 concerning the school and its begin- j
| nings, and a statement of the policies
of the University is also given by the
I student guide. Half of the time is spent
i telling about the Church, itself.
There have been days this year, ac
cording to Walker, when no people at
| all would be seen going to the Me
morial Church. This was unheard of
' in previous years, he said. The num
ber of tourist parties has fallen off con-
I siderably this year, but seems to be in- j
i creasing with the summer months.
I With the visit Sunday of the National
i Federation of Music Clubs there
j should be a great increase in the num- :
i ber of visitors to the church, sa>s !
Walker. The student guides have been !
! told to expect a delegation of Chris- J
| tian Endeavor members on July 16th.

i The church will no doubt be the cen
ter of interest for the delegates. The
j forthcoming Olympic Games is one rea
i son for expecting a large number of
; visitors next year, and the proposed
political conventions in San Francisco
j is another.
"Some people have told of having
been to Venice," said Walker, "and of
having seen M. Zampato, the man who
designed and made the mosaics in the
Chapel. Whenever Zampato discovers
any one from California, that person
' is at once welcomed and questioned
i about Stanford. The Venetian artist
. and craftsman shows the Californians
1 his best work, and some report having
j seen 20,000 different shades of color
represented in mosaic churches. This
number has, however, been increased
lo 26,000 shades since the Stanford Me
morial Church was built."

Princeton has a great system for con
serving water during the summer
quarter—they merely forget to furnish
hot water.

Too many people are content to sit
and talk about what their ancestors
did and not lift a finger to perpetuate
it.—Dr. Henry Darling.

"Some people have told of having
been to Venice," said Walker, "and of
having seen M. Zampato, the man who
designed and made the mosaics in the
Chapel. Whenever Zampato discovers
any one from California, that person
' is at once welcomed and questioned
i about Stanford. The Venetian artist
. and craftsman shows the Californians
1 his best work, and some report having
j seen 20,000 different shades of color
represented in mosaic churches. This
number has, however, been increased
lo 26,000 shades since the Stanford Me
morial Church was built."

Princeton has a great system for con

That there is no great eye in the !

neither are there any mosaic pictures I

under such mis-apprehensions.
Every day from 9 to 5 o'clock Edwin '

answer all questions were there no j
guides. It is Gerhardt whose duty it is '
to conduct visiting parties through the '
I chapel. He has a sterotyped list of true ,
' facts and figures to give out.

registrar's office in an effort to prevent
such repetition of freak statements as
are too often heard. A short resume j

of the University is also given by the
I student guide. Half of the time is spent
i telling about the Church, itself.
There have been days this year, ac
cording to Walker, when no people at

morial Church. This was unheard of
' in previous years, he said. The num
ber of tourist parties has fallen off con-
I siderably this year, but seems to be in- j
i creasing with the summer months.
