Rebates on articles bought at the
Stanford Bookstore last summer may
be obtained now, according to Ray

leave self-addressed envelopes at the
Bookstore at the end of the summer

to them next January.
The rebate is ten per cent of the pur
chase price, and is given if the pur
chaser signs his receipt and ieaves it
in the box for that purpose.
