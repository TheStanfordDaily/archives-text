# X-RAY RESEARCH SCIENTISTS VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS
## Four Noted Physics Experts Here on Science Trip 
### 
Four physicists, all of them research
workers in X-rays, visited the campus
yesterday, having attended the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement
of Science meeting in Pasadena. They
are Dr. W. D. Coolidge of the General
Electric Company at Schenectady, Pro
fessor J. C. Cooksey, of Yale, Professor
H. J. Barton of Cornell University, and
Professor J. H. Lawrence of the Uni
versity of California.

Dr. Coolidge is the inventor of the
Coolidge X-ray tube, which is the tube
most commonly used, and of the Cool
idge cathode-ray tube. In the general
research laboratory at Schenectady he
has done experiments with X-ray
tubes, using one million volts of elec
tricity.

Professor Cooksey, who once lived in
the Cooksey House (now the Phi Kappa
Psi house) on the Stanford campus, is
known for the Coeksey-Uhler X-ray
spectrometer, used for precision meas
urement of X-rays.

Professor Barton, who is a physicist
from Cornell University, uses at that
institution an X-ray tube which car
ries GOO,OOO volts.

The visitors were shown the labora
tory equipment in the Department of
Physics here, including the 200,000 volt
D.C. outfit, and were taken to the Har
ris J. Ryan high voltage laboratory.
They were entertained by Professor
Harris J. Ryan, Professor P. A. Ross,
John C. Clark, and W. W. Hansen.

Dr. Karl T. Compton, former head of
the Department of Physics at Prince
ton and the present president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
is expected to visit Stanford some time
this week-end. Dr. Compton is the
chairman of the newly founded Ameri
can Institute of Physics.
