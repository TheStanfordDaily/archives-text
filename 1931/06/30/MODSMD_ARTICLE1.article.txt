# CAPONE, ROUGHS, ETC., COMPARED BY EASTERNER
## "Cords" Known Also In East, Says Professor Judson Adams Crane Criticism of Women's Fickle Fashions By Male Given "Dig" 
### 
The uncouth, uncombed, partly un
dressed male, colloquially called a
"rough," is not a unique Stanford prod
uct, according to Judson Adams Crane,
visiting professor of law from Pitts
burg, who was interviewed by a Daily
reporter yestei-day.
"The 'roughs,' as you call them, are
found at rural schools in the East as
well as the West," Professor Crane said.
'The rough as a specimen may be a
product of evolution, but fully twenty
five years ago, the boys at Dartmouth
were wearing corduroys and wearing
them just as dirty as they are now
worn here."
The visiting professor pointed out
that the slovenly male appears only
where the students live on the campus
and walk from dormitory to class room.
City students are more nattily dressed
by necessity.
Throwing a polite dig at men who are
prone to criticize women's fickle fash
ions, he declared that the rough be
comes fashionable and then passes into
oblivion at various schools with about
the same frequency that women's skirts
change length.
Comments on Capone
Although he would rather not talk
too much shop, Professor Crane com
mented on the current "A1 Capone vs.
United States" case.
"Yes," he answered in reply to a
Daily reporter's question, "Capone will
probably be sentenced and serve a
short term. However, his conviction
will not indicate a turning point in Chi
cago or national prohibition enforce
ment. The eighteenth amendment will
be enforced in Chicago and elsewhere
only when the demand for the boot
legger's product diminishes."
He would offer no estimation on the
length of Capone's sentence but agrees
with Will Rogers' guess that the gang
leader will probably be jailed until
business is better and the price of
liquor returns to "pre-depression"
prices.
Turns to Business Conditions
Transferring to the subject of busi
ness conditions, Professor Crane then
pointed out that lawyers are among
the few persons whose services have
been highly in demand during the past
year.
"Many firms are liquidating and, of
course, rffeed legal advice. But while
the demand for lawyers has increased,
the money with which to pay them has
not. In some cases it has entirely dis
appeared," he laughingly added.
"Although there is a great demand
for lawyers, firms are hesitant about
hiring new men because they are not
sure they will be able to pay them, in
view of the present condition of col
lections."
The professor spoke highly of Stan
ford's law school.
That the present. semi-weekly "Daily"
becomes a "regular" daily during the
major university sessions was surpris
ing to Professor Crane. Several large
Eastern universities, including the
University of Pittsburgh with approxi
mately 4,000 students, have only weekly
papers, he mentioned.

The visiting professor pointed out
that the slovenly male appears only
where the students live on the campus
and walk from dormitory to class room.
City students are more nattily dressed
by necessity.
Throwing a polite dig at men who are
prone to criticize women's fickle fash

oblivion at various schools with about
the same frequency that women's skirts
change length.
Comments on Capone
Although he would rather not talk
too much shop, Professor Crane com
mented on the current "A1 Capone vs.
United States" case.
"Yes," he answered in reply to a
Daily reporter's question, "Capone will
probably be sentenced and serve a
short term. However, his conviction
will not indicate a turning point in Chi
cago or national prohibition enforce
ment. The eighteenth amendment will
be enforced in Chicago and elsewhere
only when the demand for the boot
legger's product diminishes."
He would offer no estimation on the
length of Capone's sentence but agrees
with Will Rogers' guess that the gang
leader will probably be jailed until
business is better and the price of
liquor returns to "pre-depression"
prices.
Turns to Business Conditions
Transferring to the subject of busi
ness conditions, Professor Crane then
pointed out that lawyers are among
the few persons whose services have
been highly in demand during the past
year.
"Many firms are liquidating and, of
course, rffeed legal advice. But while
the demand for lawyers has increased,
the money with which to pay them has
not. In some cases it has entirely dis
appeared," he laughingly added.
"Although there is a great demand
for lawyers, firms are hesitant about
hiring new men because they are not
sure they will be able to pay them, in
view of the present condition of col
lections."
The professor spoke highly of Stan
ford's law school.
That the present. semi-weekly "Daily"
becomes a "regular" daily during the
major university sessions was surpris
ing to Professor Crane. Several large
Eastern universities, including the
University of Pittsburgh with approxi
mately 4,000 students, have only weekly
papers, he mentioned.
The uncouth, uncombed, partly un
dressed male, colloquially called a
"rough," is not a unique Stanford prod
uct, according to Judson Adams Crane,
visiting professor of law from Pitts
burg, who was interviewed by a Daily
reporter yestei-day.
"The 'roughs,' as you call them, are
found at rural schools in the East as
well as the West," Professor Crane said.
'The rough as a specimen may be a
product of evolution, but fully twenty
five years ago, the boys at Dartmouth
were wearing corduroys and wearing
them just as dirty as they are now
worn here."
