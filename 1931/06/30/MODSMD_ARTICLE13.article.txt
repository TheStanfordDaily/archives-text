# FELTON MEMORIAL ROOM AT LIBRARY HAS FIRST EDITIONS
## 
### 
Where once candidates for advanced
degrees sweltered beneath the ques- j
tions of faculty members, in a seminar j
room on the third floor of the library j
is now located one of the most inter
esting of the many features of that I
building. This is the Felton Memorial |
Library, housing hundreds of first edi
tions of American and English au
thors.
Donated to the University by Mrs. j
Kate Felton Elkins, as a memorial to i
her mother, Charlotte Ashley Felton,
the library comprises what was once j
her own private collection of first edi- ,
tions, and is being continually aug
mented by her. It consists at present
of over 2,500 volumes. Among the i
most interesting volumes which it has I
on display are a fust edition of "Gul- ,
liver's Travels," several first editions of !
Dickens' works, and a facsimile copy
of the first edition of "Alice in Won- j
dei'land."
Though most of the books which j
have been added during the past few ;
months are the works of early Arneri- |
can authors, the tendency has been to
include a great many of those of con
temporary writers, such as Galsworthy, I
Cabell, Dreiser and Lawrence. The
most recently acquired are several
copies of limited signed editions of <
books by the late D. H. Lawrence, first
editions of Thornton Wilder's "The ;
Bridge of San Luis Rey," and several !
first editions of the works of Joseph J
Conrad.
