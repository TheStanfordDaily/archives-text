## 
### 
Walter V. Kaulfers, Stanford grad
uate student, who is working toward
his doctors degree in the department
of education, will address' the foreign
language section of the National Edu
cation Association in Los Angeles to
night on the results of an investigation
carried on during the past year in
eighteen junior high schools of Los
Angeles and Long Beach.
Kaulfers told a Daily reporter that
"Foreign language achievements mani
fest too promiscuous a relationship to
other abilities and to diverse school
subjects to bear the ear-marks of tal
ent." He believes that if more students
arc to benefit from the study of foreign
languages, the students must not neces
sarily be more carefully selected, but
the foreign language work must be
adapted to the interests and capacities
of students.
On the basis of his friends, Kaulfers
recommends the adoption of reading
during the beginning semesters with
enough oral and written work to make
the courses practical and interesting.
Work in formal grammar and trans
lation should be deferred until the ad
vance years where classes are smaller
and more select, he believes.
