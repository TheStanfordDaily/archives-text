Sit on Ihe edge of Hie Quad some morning and watch the
faces of those who are going to or coming from classes. It's not a
bad pastime. White many affect an expression of genial insoui
eanee, one will also he struck with the number of faces upon
which are stamped Ihe mark of the serious pursuer after truth.
Continue your observations by entering a classroom. Kilter,
if possible, a class of quite large size and one containing botli
graduates and undergraduates. Sooner or later a discussion
will lake place and again you will notice the demarcation be
tween Ihe lightheaded learners and Ihe serious seeker alter
truths. The "serious seekers" always have their hands up first
and 100 often they merely reiterate. what nine-tenths of Ihe
class already know. And Ibis does not mean to imply thai all
undergraduates are Ihe former and vice-versa.
These observations evidently lead one lo wonder which
group has the right altitude. Perhaps il isn't a matter of alti
tude after all; it's possible that the different altitudes represent
different temperaments. However that may be, Ihe wise course
is probably to be just a little skeptical of most that one reads
and hears.
Everett Dean Martin in a memorable chapter of his book,
"The Meaning of a Liberal Education," has the following perti
nent words to say about learning: .... "One should learn to
hold all one's beliefs with a hall-amused lightheadedness. Most
minds are loaded down with the seriousness of their convictions.
Solemnity in the presence of our eternal verities is awkward
ness, and makes us a little ridiculous, giving us Ihe appearance
of one about to shake hands with Ihe President. Why not enjoy
the humor of the situation? Our great truths may all Ihe while
be "spooling" us. It will do no harm to give them a sly wink
now and then."
Those words should give some satisfaction to the skeptical
and may well cause Ihe "grinds" to pause and think.
