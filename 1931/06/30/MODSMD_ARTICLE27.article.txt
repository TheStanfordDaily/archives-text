# LIMITATIONS ON LEADERSHIP
## 
### 
The recent commencement season brought to the front once
more the complaints of a number of college presidents, includ
ing our own president on leave, that universities are swamped
with altogether too many attendants who are not high grade
students, nor even high grade intellectuals. Pretty ordinary
stufV, these so-called college students not only do not themselves
get very far along on the road of scholarship, but they slow up
thejpace and gel in the way of those who are fitted to make
get very far along on the road o scholarship, but they slow up
better use of the educational facilities and to equip themselves
for the leadership which university training ought to supply
the world.
To which a reply that.is frequently made is that in these
days colleges train not leaders alone lull the men and women
who will constitute the large group of intelligent citizens who
can follow and support the leaders and make their leadership
effective.
There is material here for endless debateâ€”and the debate
bids fair to become endless, .lust what is the business and duty
of a university in this regard? Must it keep its doors open to
nil or has it a right to restrict its opportunities to those who can
make greatest use of them and give to that selected group more
than it could to a larger and more general mass?
One thing is obvious: Leaders arc handicapped by the qual
ity of those they would lead. Educational leaders can bring
about reforms only so fast as they can persuade the majority
in power that,the reform ought to lie made. Political leaders
can accomplish progress for the people only so fast as the mass
of the people can he brought lo permit it. The best and ablest
of these leaders frequently have to half-conceal their purposes
and objectives and surround thein with a lot of practically in
sincere phrases to secure public good in spite of the public.
Witness the present attempts of the leaders of all the civilized
nations to get somewhere with the debt moratorium in the face
of demagogues who rant in superficial language.
We need leaders, then; hut somebody must do as much as
possible to prepare intelligent followers in larger and larger
numbers.
