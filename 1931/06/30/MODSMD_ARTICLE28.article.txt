The main distinction between the student coming to Stan
ford tor the lirst time in the summer and him who enters at
the beginning of the regular session is that the former discovers
the library sometime during his first week here, while it often
takes the latter more than a month to renew his acquaintance.
After gazing for a few moments at the Memorial Church,
driving past President Hoover's home, and stopping at the book
store long enough to buy a few required texts, the earnest school
teachers and the rosv-cheeked youth fresh from high school
retire to the library and remain there for the rest of the quarter,
coming out merely to eat, sleep, and attend classes.
Hut the comparatively few remaining "regular" students
with blase superiority keep away from the over-crowded li
brary. Maybe they think they couldn't gel a seal there if I hey
wanted one. Their evening preparation for next day's classes
involves faithful attendance at the Palo Alto picture shows, fol
lowed by active intellectual exertion in remembering suites and
trumps.
Later, of course, they will crash in on the liho and gel seats
despite Hie eager Irosh and determined seekers of "secondary
credentials." There's a moral in all Ibis, of course the old
moral of Aesop's fable of the slow but steady tortoise and the
swift but care-free hare.
