# Damrosch Stresses Value of Music In College
## Educational Power Of Radio Praised By Musician 
### 
That the college has the great re
sponsibility of giving its students an
appreciation of music is the opinion of
Walter Damrosch, who was guest of
honor Sunday afternoon at a recep
tion in Roble Hall. He suggested that
music gives the student a vehicle for
expressing his emotions, which can not
be gotten in any other way.
When asked concerning the import
ance of radio to American culture,
Damrosch said:
"I consider the radio the most im
portant invention since the printing
press."
Several days ago the noted con
ductor told the Federated Music Clubs
that the radio meant new life for him.
Before national broadcasting came into
existence, the dean of American or
chestra leaders considered that his
life's work was nearly doneâ€”he had
little more to give. Today Damrosch
is one of the men who most utilizes
the radio to educate the public, musi
cally.
Mrs. Theresa Russell, associate pro
fessor of English, and Mrs. A. B. Clark,
wife of Professor Clark, of Stanford,
poured tea for some 600 guests Sunday
afternoon, from 4 until 6, among whom
were the delegates of the National Con
vention of Federated Music Clubs, and
their national officers; Sir Hamilton
Harty, who will conduct the next con
cert at Woodland Theatre, and faculty
members and students of Stanford.
