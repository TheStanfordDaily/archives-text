FIGHTING THRU—At the Varsity.
Ken Maynard and his magnificant
white horse "Tarzan" in their first
talking picture—and it's good. The
popular Western star has an agreeable,
enthusiastic screen voice that fits well
with his vibrant personality and makes
his performance all the more pleasing.
If one has any love or respect for
animals, he will have to give three
cheers at the end of the show for "Tar
| zan." This beautiful big horse carries
out most amusing antics with an intel
ligence that many men could well
I boast of. How much of his tricky acting
is faked, if any, it is difficult 1o say,
i but he certainly proves that all the
| brains in the world aren't confined to
i human heads.
Wallace McDonald, as Tennessee
Maiden, mining partner of Maynard,
I does an excellent bit of work early
in the picture until his life is sacri
ficed for the sake of the plot. Jeanette
Loff adds her feminine charm to .he
show in an unobtrusive way.
The stage coach wrecks, hard riding,
and quick shooting episodes, so es
sential to a Western picture are\done
in an extraordinarily fine manner, and
j help make it one of the best thrillers
j since the days of Bill Hart.
HAD SISTER—At the California, May
field.
A delightfully human story taken
from the novel by Booth Tarkington
I of a country town girl of fine family
who is selfish to the extent of causing
j everyone else lots of trouble in satis-
I fying her little whims—and they all
love her for it. She nearly ruins her
father financially, causes her sister to
i lie in her protection, spurns the honest
attentions of a couple of likeable town
i chaps, and elopes with a city slicker
with visions of gay and frivolous life.
He deserts her almost immediately, and
! she returns home in time to save her
, father from disgrace. She confesses her
follies, and tears the soiled pages from
J her book of life. She and her sister
got married to the right men and all
live happily ever afterward. Sidney
Fox makes a splendid "bad sister" and
a fine cast includes Conrad Nagol,
Zazu Pitts, and Bette Davis.
THE VICE SQUAD—At The New
Stanford
A fair show that is weakened con
siderably by the all too obvious in
consistencies in the plot. For instance
the whole story hinges on the action of
a promising young gentleman in the
diplomatic service in throwing aside
all prospects of a brilliant career by
shielding the honor of an ambassador's
! wife, who unquestionably was not
worth the trouble. The rest of the pic
ture concerns itself with his actions as
| stool pigeon for a corrupt vice-squad,
an organization theoretically estab
lished lo eliminate the wicked women
j from the city.

Paul Lucas, with a foreign accent,
Kay Francis, and a lovely young girl,
Judith Wood, make the picture good
entertainment.
In short features, Bobby Jones wields
the mashie-niblick as nobody else can,
and there are some fine views of Hol
lywood in technicolor.
"Tomorrow and Tomorrow" Philip
Barry's delightful, yet thoughtful play
is now in the final days of its engage
ment at the Curran Theater, San Fran
cisco. It has been decided to end the
run on Saturday, July 11th.
With Kay Johnson and Henry Daniell
in the leading roles and the superb sup
porting cast surrounding them, this
play has met with marked favor from
all classes of playgoers. Based on the
biblical legend of Elisha and the Shun
amite woman, it is a play readily un
derstandable, yet subtle to a degree
through the able craftsmanship of
Playwright Barry.
Those who have not yet taken in
"Tomorrow and Tomorrow" are ad
vised by critics not to miss what is gen
erally acknowledged to be one of the
real treats of the theatrical seasoni
Matinees are given on Wednesday
and Saturday and offer an opportunity
for out-of-town playgoers to combine
a day of shopping with a visit to the
play, with its particular appeal to
mothers and wives.

ent college system of teaching lan
guages is criminal.
