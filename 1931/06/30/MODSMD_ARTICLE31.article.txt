# PASADENA PREACHER GIVES SUNDAY SERMON
## 
### 
The Gospel according to St. Matthew
furnished the basis for the sermon
given in the Memorial Church Sunday
by the Rev. Theodore G. Soares of the
Community Church, Pasadena. His
text was taken from the sixth chapter:
"Be not therefore anxious for the mor
row for the morrow will be anxious
for itself. Sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof."
"Though Burns, in his poem 'To a
Mouse,' bemoaned the fact that man
must remember the troubles of the
past and has the fears of the future
added to the difficulties of the pres
ent," Dr. Soares stated, "Jesus teaches
man to face reality with provision for
the future, but without care and anx
iety. Man can, if he will be as care
free as the deer, which never knows
the memory of failure and can never
know the fear of death. Man can be
carefree, not as a creature who doesn't
know, but as a child of God, not beset
by fear of trouble tomorrow."
