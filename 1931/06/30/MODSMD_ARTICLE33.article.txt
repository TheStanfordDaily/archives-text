# BOOK BY STANFORD REVIEW EDITOR TO BE RELEASED IN OCTOBER
## Campus Experiences Related In "Chinatown Quest By Mrs. Carol Wilson 
### 
"Chinatown Quest" is the title of a \
new book by Mrs. Carol Green Wilson,
editor of the Stanford Illustrated Re- ]
view, which is being published by the
Stanford University Press. It will be
released in October.
The book is a story of the life of
Miss Donaldina Cameron during the
twenty-five years that she has been
Ihe superintendent of a San Francisco
home for Chinese gills. The Home,
located at 920 Sacramento Street, is
called by the older inhabitants of Chi
natown, "China Street." It was estab
lished in 1783 by the Foreign Mission
of the Presbyterian Church for the
purpose of rescuing Chinese slave girls.
It is not, however, merely a home for
the "Mooie-jai," as the Chinese term
ihe slave girl, but aims at international
friendship by offering protection to
other unfortunate Chinese girls who
have been left to their own devices.
The (irst Chinese ,girl to graduate
from Stanford University asked help
of Miss Cameron and was taken into
the Home. She worked her way
through high school and junior col
lege and, with some outside help,
through the University. She is now
studying medicine at Philadelphia.
The book will be of special interest
to Stanford people, as many of the in
cidents and adventures took place in
the vicinity of Palo Alto and the Uni
versity. One chapter deals with a
young "Mooie-jai," Kum Quai, who
had been rescued by Miss Cameron.
The girl was located and abducted by
her former owner and the search that
followed involved the whole Univer
?,ity. Students, unsatisfied with the
more conservative methods of the pro
lessors who merely passed resolutions,
took torches and lanterns and marched
in a body at 10 o'clock at night to the
San .Jose jail, where Miss Cameron
and the frightened Kum Quai were
confined.
Chinatown Quest" is filled with simi
lar adventures and incidents of interest
and excitement which portray the
wonderful work that has been done by
Miss Cameron. Two hundred girls have
been rescued and the slave trade has
been completely checked, partly as a
result of her efforts.
