# FRATRNITY HOUSE BECOMES KINDERGARTEN; TRICYCLES AND MUDPIES ABOUND ON LAWN
## 
### 
Sunbaths continue to be the order
of things at the Delta Upsilon house ]
on Salvaitierra street. However, small
boys and girls, instead of fraternity ;
men of brain and brawn, are the bath- i
ers, both in Stanford sunlight and in j
the famed D.U. pool. Slides and lawn j
swings and tricycles and mud-pies 1
grace the front lkwn, in place of the :
familiar Spring Quarter baseball game, j
Story-books usurp the place of texts, j
and the female sex reigns, both as in- i
structors and pupils.
Such unfamiliar and unexpected ap- •
paritions in and about a fraternity ■
house are to be explained by the fact ,
that a kindergarten summer school is !
in session, with a present enrollment ,
of thirty-five, and a hoped-for increase j
to fifty youngsters, between the ages ;
of three and thirteen.
The Lona Hazzard School of Ala
meda, and the Charing Cross Kinder
garten of San Francisco,' have com
bined for the summer, and are con
ducting this kindergarten from June 15
to August 15. Mrs. Lona Hazzard and
Mrs. Clarabelle Stone are in charge,
having for their assistants, five young
| teachers, three of whom are from the
i University of California, one of whom
jis a high-school senior, and one a
graduate of the Broadoaks Kindergar
ten and Primary Training School.
Miss Dorothea Carr is the dramatics
teacher engaged for the summer, and
I has plans for interesting work with

puppets and is at work just now on a
Mother Goose pagaent. Miss' Frances
Martell is the swimming teacher, and
; iias for an assistant, Miss Nina Glas
[of Polytechnic High School in San
j Francisco, who also helps Miss Portia
i Wallace with the very youngest chil
-1 dren. The housemother, whose duties
' seem to be numerous and varied, is
, Miss Rocelia Palmer.
The clay is divided up into regular
j periods, the activities depending on the
i ages of the children. There are two
• swimming periods, one for the older
i children, ;md one for the tiny ones.
; Story-telling and walks and sunbaths
j and three meals a day occupy the wak
! ing hours.
; "We also take advantage of the ex
tra-curricular activities which the Uni
j vcrsily has to offer," said Miss Wallace.
; "Sunday evening all the children went
j to the organ recital, and we plan to
| visit the museum, and the art gallery. '
A smaller group, under the direction
of Mrs. Ella Shaffer, occupies the Phi
Kappa Sigma house on Alvarado Ave
nue. The Verna-Jean Kindergarten
| from San Francisco has moved down
'to the campus for the summer. Ages
! of the group are from three to ten, and
i there are fifteen pupiis. Mrs. Shaffer
I has a staff of four to assist her. Story
! telling and games and swimming are
| included in the daily program. The
! kindergarten plans to be in session un-
I til the middle of August.
