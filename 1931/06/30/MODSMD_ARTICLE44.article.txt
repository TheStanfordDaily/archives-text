# DEAN OF CONDUCTORS RECEIVED AGAIN WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM
## Last Appearance in Woodland Theater Is Greeted Appreciatively 
### 
Walter Damrosch left the Woodland
Theater Sunday afternoon after con
ducting the second of the concerts of
the summer season of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, having fur
ther endeared himself to the hearts of
music-lovers in the West. An enthu
siastic audience greeted his «econd ap
pearance, anticipating the rare treat
in store for them, in the Wagnerian
half of the program, as an interpreter
of which Damrosch has no peer.
Unfamiliar with the first number,
Glazounow's Symphony No. 5 in B flat,
Ihe audience responded quickly for
the music hud a familiar sound, so
much like Mendelssohn' is the com
poser. The sunny, melodic, danceable
first movement betrayed its Russian
origin in the very last strain. To his
radio audience and to his out-of-door
audience Damrosch smilingly described
the second movement, "Rain is falling,
dancing up and down, drenching all
the children in the town."
The third movement of the Sym
phony was, in the conductor's words,
"undoubtedly a love-song, tender, me
lodious, beautifully orchestrated, with
a threat of death creeping in. The
themes were very Russian and decid
edly jazz, though written long before
the name "jazz" had been heard.
New Numbers Played
The next two numbers were played
for the first time at the Woodland con
certs. One was a Pa vane, by.Faure, a
slow ceremonious dance of Spanish
origin, with a decided tragic note. To
the second of the two, Damrosch gra
ciously consented to an encore, so pop
ular did it prove. It was the "Entrance
of the Little Fauns," from the ballet
"Cydalise and the Satyr," by Pierne,
an enchanting little march that was
meant to accompany a number of
small fauns on their way to school, led
by their teacher, an old satyr.
It was the post-intermission half of
the concert which the audience most
awaited, the Wagnerian half. The
opening strains of the "Prelude" to
"Lohengrin" seemed to come "out of
the blue ether of the sky," as Wagner
himself wrote of the Prelude, and to
fill the theater with its sweet soprano
purity. The "Processional of the Gods"
from "Das Rheingold" displayed a mag
nificent power and breadth, and was
one of the highlights of the program.
From what is probably Wagner's most
popular opera, "Tristan and Isolde,"
were presented the "Prelude" and
"Love-death." The "Prelude" to "Die
Meistersinger," closed the program,
and was a beautiful and sumptuous in
troduction constructed from some cf
the principal themes of the opera, Wag
ner's only comic opera.
Sir Hamilton Harty Comes Next
A remarkable thing about Damrosch
was his apparent facility and subtlety
of movement, restrained, yet thor
oughly effective. The master con
ductor never ignored his audience by
losing himself in the music, yet neither
did he neglect the task at hand, but
seemed to maintain a delightful bal
ance between orchestra and audience.
Next Sunday's concert will be con
ducted by Sir Hamilton Harty, who
has recently arrived from Manchester,
England.

Sir Hamilton Harty Comes Next
A remarkable thing about Damrosch
was his apparent facility and subtlety
of movement, restrained, yet thor
oughly effective. The master con
ductor never ignored his audience by
losing himself in the music, yet neither
did he neglect the task at hand, but
seemed to maintain a delightful bal
ance between orchestra and audience.
Next Sunday's concert will be con
ducted by Sir Hamilton Harty, who
has recently arrived from Manchester,
England.
Walter Damrosch left the Woodland
Theater Sunday afternoon after con
ducting the second of the concerts of
the summer season of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, having fur
ther endeared himself to the hearts of
music-lovers in the West. An enthu
siastic audience greeted his «econd ap
pearance, anticipating the rare treat
in store for them, in the Wagnerian
half of the program, as an interpreter
of which Damrosch has no peer.
Unfamiliar with the first number,
Glazounow's Symphony No. 5 in B flat,
Ihe audience responded quickly for
the music hud a familiar sound, so
much like Mendelssohn' is the com
poser. The sunny, melodic, danceable
first movement betrayed its Russian
origin in the very last strain. To his
radio audience and to his out-of-door
audience Damrosch smilingly described
the second movement, "Rain is falling,
dancing up and down, drenching all
the children in the town."
The third movement of the Sym
phony was, in the conductor's words,
"undoubtedly a love-song, tender, me
lodious, beautifully orchestrated, with
a threat of death creeping in. The
themes were very Russian and decid
edly jazz, though written long before
the name "jazz" had been heard.
New Numbers Played
The next two numbers were played
for the first time at the Woodland con
certs. One was a Pa vane, by.Faure, a
slow ceremonious dance of Spanish
origin, with a decided tragic note. To
the second of the two, Damrosch gra
ciously consented to an encore, so pop
ular did it prove. It was the "Entrance
of the Little Fauns," from the ballet
"Cydalise and the Satyr," by Pierne,
an enchanting little march that was
meant to accompany a number of
small fauns on their way to school, led
by their teacher, an old satyr.
It was the post-intermission half of
the concert which the audience most
awaited, the Wagnerian half. The
opening strains of the "Prelude" to
"Lohengrin" seemed to come "out of
the blue ether of the sky," as Wagner
himself wrote of the Prelude, and to
fill the theater with its sweet soprano
purity. The "Processional of the Gods"
from "Das Rheingold" displayed a mag
nificent power and breadth, and was
one of the highlights of the program.
From what is probably Wagner's most
popular opera, "Tristan and Isolde,"
were presented the "Prelude" and
"Love-death." The "Prelude" to "Die
Meistersinger," closed the program,
and was a beautiful and sumptuous in
troduction constructed from some cf
the principal themes of the opera, Wag
ner's only comic opera.
