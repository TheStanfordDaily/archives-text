# STUDENT CRAWLS TO GLORY BY ‘IMPOSSIBLE’ FEAT IN JAP SHRINE
## 
### 
There is one Stanford student who
is absolutely assured of his entrance
into Heaven, provided his passport,
which is printed on fine Japanese rice
paper, is a 'guarantee of such passage.
He is Fred Hoffman of the History de
partment.
Last year when Hoffman was travel
ing through Japan and the Orient, he
stopped at the sacred city of Nara, and
like all good tourists he visited the sa
cred Buddah temple.
"The old temple has been partly de
stroyed by fire many times during the
last century, and at the present time
it is a simple shrine constructed of
wood and bamboo," according to Hoff
man's story.
"The chief occupant of the temple is
a large lacquered Buddah that is sur
rounded by twelve great teak pillars.
Directly in back of the great Buddah
is a little alcove or room five feet
square that is blocked by one of the
large pillars and can only be reached

through a hole twelve inches square
at the base of the teak column.
"The old temple priests relate that
centuries ago a Japanese saint used
this alcove for prayer and meditation,
and tradition has it that whoever gains
entrance to the room through the pil
lar will be eternally blessed, and with
out further examination will be as
sured of a place in Heaven."
Along with the rest of the tourists,
Fred wanted to make a try for a pair
of wings, and using that ingenuity for
which Stanford men are famous, he ac
complished the almost impossible feat
and went through the hole on the bias.
Up to that time only fourteen people
have been able to get through, and
Fred is the proud owner of passport
number fifteen. Children are excluded,
and a person can not be shoved in, but
must crawl through on his own power.
The old Japanese legend is that the
passport must be buried with the per
son and thus will get him past the
pearly gates into paradise.
