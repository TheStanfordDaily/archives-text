# STADIUM MAY BE SITE OF OLYMPIC TRYOUTS
## 
### 
That Stanford University's applica
tion to the American Olympic Games
Committee to have the Card stadium
named as the site for trials for the
1932 Olympic Games may be favorably
acted upon, was revealed here today
by Graduate Manager Alfred Masters.
According to Masters, Olympic of
ficials are expected to accept Stan
ford's application, as southern officers
of the committee in charge have been
declared to favor the removal of the
tryouts from Los Angeles, where ihey
were originally planned to take place.
Action on the change is expected as
soon as Joseph T. England, United
States Olympic ti'ack and field chair
man, is able to assemble his commit!ee
to move on the proposal.
