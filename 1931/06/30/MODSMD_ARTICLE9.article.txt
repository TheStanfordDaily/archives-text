# RODO'S PROGRAM FOR SOUTH AMERICA TOPIC OF RIOSECO LECTURE
## 
### 
"Rodo and His Ideas of the United
States" was the theme of the second
in a series of Spanish lectures given
on Monday night in the Little Theatre
by Professor Arturo Torres-Rioseco.
Rioseco presented at length the views
of the South American philosopher
Rodo, especially those in "Ariel," a
book in which Rodo reviews the or
ganization of South American coun
tries and, incidentally, suggests a cul
tural progi'am for them.
Rodo upholds the tenets of Greek
beauty and Christian charity. He con
demns imitations of the United States,
here he states, these ideals are not car
ried out. To Rodo the brutal struggle
for life in America has destroyed the
idea of charity and he also asserts that
the tendency to do things that have a
definite interest and purpose has elim
inated much of real beauty.
Rodo also resents the North Ameri
can influence in his country as seen in
the economical and industrial develop
ment of the United States in South
America.
