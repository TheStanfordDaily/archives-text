# ASIATICS AMONG STUDENT HEADS AT U. OF HAWAII
## Professor Adams Contrasts Inter-racial Feature on Pacific Coast University of About 1,000 Students Is Only 22 Years Old 
### 
A school of many races and nation- !
alities, the University of Hawaii dif- i
fers from the colleges of the Pacific
Coast in that the Asiatic students arc ;
in the center of activities and are
among the leaders of student endeav
ors.
Thus Romanzo Colfax Adams, acting i
professor of sociology for the summer
quarter from the University of Hawaii,
described an outstanding difference be
tween the schools on the Pacific Coast
and his own university.
Asiatics in Middle of Things
"The inter-racial feature is an in
teresting factor in the University of
Hawaii," said Professor Adams. "Asi
atics are right in the middle of things, i
Student body officials, and editors cf
the weekly paper will many times be !
Orientals, with members of other races
and nationalities working in harmony j
with them.
Many of these students work right
into the business world continuing the
same relation to their white neighbors.
One former editor of the university
paper is now an important columnist
cn a Honolulu daily, writing a feature,
'Where East Meets West'."
Numerous Racial Groups There
Numerous racial groups make up the
student body of the University of Ha
waii, according to Professor Adams, j
Many Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, and
part Hawaiians are in attendance to j
make up the Oriental portion of the â– 
student body. A group titled "Haolo" !
is composed of Americans and north j
Europeans. Some Spanish and Povtu- '
guese students, with a sprinkling from
many other nations, complete the list. ;
The university has approximately ,
1,000 students working for decrees, al- !
though many others take part time i
work in day or evening classes.
A Comparatively Young Institution
The University of Hawaii is compar
atively a young school. About 22 years J
ago it was established as an agricul- j
tural college, which was converted into j
the present university in 1920.
Athletics and social functions make j
up an important part of the student j
life, with the Asiatics again taking part I
in the activities. Dances are attended j
by all students, although members of [
each national group associate together |
rather than mingle with those of other I
groups.
Professor Adams has been at the !
University of Hawaii for twelve years, J
before which he was professor at the j
University of Nevada.
