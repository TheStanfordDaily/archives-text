## Doubles Included if Enough Signed by Wednesday 
### 
A dozen entries have thus far been
recorded for the Roble tennis tourna
ment to begin Friday, July 10, accord
ing to Margaret McDougall, manager.
Providing a sufficient number sign up
before Wednesday, doubles matches
will be included with singles in the
tournament.

Last year the Roble women con
ducted swimming meets and archery
contests, but there was not a tennis
tournament, as a sufficient number did
not sign up.

Those women students who have al
ready signed up are: Martha Alexan
der, June Brichard, Catherine Cart
lidge, Virginia Chamberlain, Sue Clark,
Hazel Dillon, Janette Goodman, Vesta
Harter, Josephine Hawes, Margaret
Murphy, Mary Pike and Dorothy Pyle.

Miss McDougall states that the pur
pose of the tournament is not prima
rily to find a tennis champion, but to
arouse interest and to furnish a source
of fun for the summer women students.
