# DR. WILEY SPEAKS ON EDUCATION AT LUNCHEON MEETING
## 
### 
"The outside world must be brought
into the school room more if the schools
are to train students to live in our
modern world." This is the belief of
Dr. George M. Wiley, Assistant Com
missioner of Education for the State
of New York, who spoke at the regu
lar Wednesday luncheon of the Edu
cation Club, yesterday. Dr. Wiley is
acting professor of education for the
summer quarter.

Taking as his general theme the sub
ject of "Education as the Development
of Control," Wiley emphasized the need
of the school's curriculum becoming
more flexible. The world is moving
faster than the schools are, he con
tinued, and the schools must keep their
students in touch with the times by
recognizing the world's progress more
than it now does.

Wiley especially emphasized the need
of modernizing the social studies. "Stu
dents need to learn self-control so that
they will be able to live with others.
The essential principles of sciciology
and economics can be reduced to a
few simple axioms and included in the
curriculum in somewhat the same way
that physiology is now taught," he said.
In introducing Dr. Wiley, W. L. Iver
son, chairman of the program commit
tee, mentioned that Wiley had received
an honorary L.H.D. from Union Col
lege, his alma mater, just before com
ing to Stanford.
Group singing led by Claude Shull
and a group of pieces played on an ac
cordian by a boy from Sequoia high
school comprised the musical part of
the program.
