# CAREER OF BRAZILIAN MONARCH RELATED IN LECTURE BY MARTIN
## Establishment of Schools Was Great Ambition of Dom Pedro II 
### 
"The only ruler eyer to occupy a
throne in the new world and one of
the most interesting and colorful fig
ures that Latin America has ever pro
duced, was Dom Pedro 11, emperor of
Brazil from 1840 until 1899," declared
Professor Martin of the History De
partment in a lecture on Tuesday night
in the Little Theatre before an audi
ence of 150.

In tracing the rise and decline of the
Brazilian monarchy under Dom Pe
dro's regime, Professor Martin began
by reviewing how Brazil, discovered
and settled by the Portuguese, re
mained a colony of Portugal until the
nineteenth century, when under the
leadership of Dom Pedro I, she de
clared her independence in 1821.

When only 15 years old, Dom Pedro
11, was formally recognized as Em
peror of Brazil in 1840. He was a most
precocious youth, his entire time be
ing devoted to learning under the
guidance of the most noted tutors, and
consequently he was deprived of a
normal boyhood. By the time the young
monarch was 25 it was clear that Bra
zil possessed a ruler of unusual ability
and remarkable capacity. He was
greatly interested in art, astronomy,
literature, and poetry, but his chief
interest was education and the estab
lishment of schools.

Martin remarked thai nothing pleased
the emperor more than to take charge
of an examination, and that he loved
to reward those who had passed and
to encourage those who had failed.
Dom Pedro once stated that "teaching
in a school is the noblest profession of
mankind."
Offered to Mediate in Civil War
"Dom Pedi'o traveled extensively,"
continued Professor Martin, "and was
in Europe four times and in the United
States once."
He produced quite an impression
upon the American people at the time
of the Civil War, when he proposed to
President Lincoln that he mediate. Lin
coln refused by saying that should the
time ever come when the United States
should desire a mediator they would
choose Dom Pedro.
"The emperor was ever reluctant to
take up arms, but once the sword was
drawn he became an untiring fighter,"
Martin went on.
He was a pacifist, and always subor
dinated the military faction, and it was
this attitude toward the army that
eventually led to his overthrow.
Abolition of Slavery Causes Opposition
The greatest social reform under his
regime, was the complete abolition of
slavery, which had from the beginning
taken such firm roots in Brazilian soil.
It was this abolition without compen
sation that turned the land-owners
against him. Possessing not too much
zeal and tolerent of all, he was theo
retically a Catholic, and by alienating
the church from civil affairs he gained
the opposition of the church.
Finally, on November 15, 1889, oppo
sition to the emperor came to a head,
and under the leadership of Benjamin
Constant the army revolted, declaring
Brazil a republic.
Professor Martin concluded by re
ferring to how Dom Pedro was forced
to leave the country and stated that
for nearly half a century he had sup
plied the .cohesive force preventing an
archy and that he had successfully di
rected Brazil through an apprentice
ship of self-government within the
confines of a liberal constitutional mon
archy.

drawn he became an untiring fighter,"
Martin went on.
He was a pacifist, and always subor
dinated the military faction, and it was
this attitude toward the army that
eventually led to his overthrow.
Abolition of Slavery Causes Opposition
The greatest social reform under his
regime, was the complete abolition of
slavery, which had from the beginning
taken such firm roots in Brazilian soil.
It was this abolition without compen
sation that turned the land-owners
against him. Possessing not too much
zeal and tolerent of all, he was theo
retically a Catholic, and by alienating
the church from civil affairs he gained
the opposition of the church.
Finally, on November 15, 1889, oppo
sition to the emperor came to a head,
and under the leadership of Benjamin
Constant the army revolted, declaring
Brazil a republic.
Professor Martin concluded by re
ferring to how Dom Pedro was forced
to leave the country and stated that
for nearly half a century he had sup
plied the .cohesive force preventing an
archy and that he had successfully di
rected Brazil through an apprentice
ship of self-government within the
confines of a liberal constitutional mon
archy.
"The only ruler eyer to occupy a
throne in the new world and one of
the most interesting and colorful fig
ures that Latin America has ever pro
duced, was Dom Pedro 11, emperor of
Brazil from 1840 until 1899," declared
Professor Martin of the History De
partment in a lecture on Tuesday night
in the Little Theatre before an audi
ence of 150.

In tracing the rise and decline of the
Brazilian monarchy under Dom Pe
dro's regime, Professor Martin began
by reviewing how Brazil, discovered
and settled by the Portuguese, re
mained a colony of Portugal until the
nineteenth century, when under the
leadership of Dom Pedro I, she de
clared her independence in 1821.

When only 15 years old, Dom Pedro
11, was formally recognized as Em
peror of Brazil in 1840. He was a most
precocious youth, his entire time be
ing devoted to learning under the
guidance of the most noted tutors, and
consequently he was deprived of a
normal boyhood. By the time the young
monarch was 25 it was clear that Bra
zil possessed a ruler of unusual ability
and remarkable capacity. He was
greatly interested in art, astronomy,
literature, and poetry, but his chief
interest was education and the estab
lishment of schools.

Martin remarked thai nothing pleased
the emperor more than to take charge
of an examination, and that he loved
to reward those who had passed and
to encourage those who had failed.
Dom Pedro once stated that "teaching
in a school is the noblest profession of
mankind."
Offered to Mediate in Civil War
"Dom Pedi'o traveled extensively,"
continued Professor Martin, "and was
in Europe four times and in the United
States once."
He produced quite an impression
upon the American people at the time
of the Civil War, when he proposed to
President Lincoln that he mediate. Lin
coln refused by saying that should the
time ever come when the United States
should desire a mediator they would
choose Dom Pedro.
"The emperor was ever reluctant to
take up arms, but once the sword was
drawn he became an untiring fighter,"
Martin went on.
He was a pacifist, and always subor
dinated the military faction, and it was
this attitude toward the army that
eventually led to his overthrow.
