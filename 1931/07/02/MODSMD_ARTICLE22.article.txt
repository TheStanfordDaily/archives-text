Perhaps this is as good a tiiVe as any to take up once again
the cudgel for reform in men's clothing.
While one risks charges of treason in mentioning it, the truth
is that some of these afternoons get rather warm. Not hot (let
him who says the word die!) hut warm. And yet, behold the
spectacle of some summer students plodding down the Quad,
even in the middle of the afternoon, wearing vests, coats, and
ties.
No authentic investigation Inis yet been made as to the mo
lives that lead to sncli sadistic exhibitions. I hose interested
might find some evidences of Freudian complexes and glandular
delicieneies. Rut the probable explanation is that those who
insist on dressing in such a way have not escaped the clutches
of that bugaboo, convention.
The "rough" remnant represented here for the summer has
gone quite a way toward comfort bv adopting the standard
equipment of cords and tieless shirts. Others iollow their lead
in varying stages of deshabille. And yet, in spite ol these re
forms, mankind is continuing to flout the undoubtful findings
of science relative to the connection between .sunlight, coolness,
and health. The battle has just begun, men.
Well, what to do? Many suggestions have been made on the
attire a man should adopt. The principal suggestion in the pro
posals that have been made is that man abandon his full length
trousers for a form of "shorts" and his collar and tie for a loose
tunic open at the throat. Unquestionably such clothing would
be more comfortable. And yet, considering our summer quarter
student body, perhaps we should be content for the present with
limiting the reform to cords and shirts.
