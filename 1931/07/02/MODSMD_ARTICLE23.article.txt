"Times are bad. There is work tor few. You fellows arc
lucky lo he in school," the student hears on every side.
He sees friends who have been graduated and who are un
able to get a job—those with chosen professions as unfortunate
as those who want "just any job." lie sees fellows loafing or
traveling while waiting for a job. He sees others continuing in
school because "there's nothing else to do."
It calls to mind a Chicago Tribune cartoon of a year ago
in which a Senior in cap audi gown stands at the side ot a
highway with thumbs pointing in both directions as the cars
whir past him.
That it is terribly hard to get a job after graduation is
true, and it is also true that thousands of this year's college
graduates are still "in the ranks of the unemployed."
But, it is always thus after Commencement Day.
It may be worse than ordinarily this year. It may divert
fellows back to school or to other than their declared voca
tions. In many ways it is bad—in a few ways it is good.
The student may have to work much harder to get, and to
keep, a job. He may be even more uncertain of the future than
in normal years. Hut if he gets a job, keeps it, and advances,
he will learn much of the real value of money—and the real
value of labor.
Others are indeed "luckv to be in school."
