						PHILOSOPHY FOR STUDENTS
## 
### 
Dr. Samuel Palmer Rrooks, president of Ravlor I niversity,
Texas, for twenty-nine years, recently died. At his deathbed he
signed his students' graduation diplomas, and left this message
to be read to them at commencement exercises:
"I stand on the border of mortal life, but I face eternal lite.
"I look backward to the years of the past to see all pettiness,
all triviality shrink into nothing, and disappear.
"Adverse criticism has no meaning now. Only the worth
while tilings, the constructive things, the things that have been
built for the good of mankind and the glory of (iod count now.
"There is beauty, there is joy, and there is laughter in life
as I here ought to be.
"But remember, my students, not to regard lightly nor to
ridicule the sacred things, those worth-while things. Hold them
dear, cherish them, for they alone will sustain you in the end.
And remember, too, that only through work and, otttiincs,
through hardships may they be obtained.
"But the compensation of blessing and sweetness at the hist
will glorify every hour of work and every heartache Irom hard
ship.
"Do not face the future with timidity or with fear. Face it
solidly, courageously, joyously. Have faith in what it holds.
".My own faith as 1 approach eternity grows stronger day by
day. The faith I have had in life is projected into this vast
future toward which I travel now.
"I know tluit 1 go to an all-powerful (iod, wherever lie may
be. I know tie is a personality who created man in 11 i s image.
Beyond that I have no knowledge no fear only faith."
A man who lives for twenty-nine years in any community
sees much; especially true is this in a college community. Dr.
Rrooks' valedictory is ;i message not only for Ravlor University
students, but may well he pondered by students of any uni
versitv.
