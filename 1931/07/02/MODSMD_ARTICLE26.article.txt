A story in the Daily carries the in

Stanford faculty have been appointed
to the Board of Directors of the Palo
Alto Rotary Club. Such being the case
it is entirely possible that when Presi
dent Hoover returns to the Stanford
Campus from the White House, he will
be greeted by the Palo Alto Rotarians
with a song from the pen of a former
president of the international organi
zation, which may go something like
this.
Oil, liowdy, Mr. President,
Come in and sit right down.
We're mighty glad to see you
In our up and coming town.
In our town of Palo Alto
We're a very jolly crew
We're all hundred percenters
And we know that you are, too.
We're glad to see our President
Is just a regular guy
And not an "intellectual"
Willi a watch tflass in one eye.
We know our town is better
Than Washington, D.C.
And we hope you like this corner
Of the Land of Liberty.
So Howdy, Mr. Hoover,
Come in and sit right down
We're mighty glad to see you
In our up and coming town.

the amount of noise.
