ALWAYS GOODBYE—At the New
Stanford.
Elissa Landi alone is well worth the
price of admission. This charming new
actress is possessed with unusual dra
matic talent and give;; a fine display
of emotional versatility. Her acting un
doubtedly lifts a trifling plot up into the
strata of good entertainment.
The plot is one of the last, it is to
be hoped, of a Hollywood gusher of
crooks and the wickedness of the city
that has been spreading itself through
out the theaters of the country for the
past three years. You've seen them
before, so there is nothing to be gained
by giving a synopsis here. Miss Landi
plays the role of a girl who doesn't
quite know whether she should go
"crooked" or stay "straight." She runs
from one man to another but it is "al
ways goodbye."
Lewis Stone is present with his cus
tomary poise and convincing person
ality. Paul Cavanaugh, who is best
known for his excellent work in "Un
faithful," with Ruth Chatterton, takes
the part of the crook and handles it in
fine shape. John Garrick, Frederick
Kerr, Herbert Bunston and Lumsden
Hare complete a good cast.

LAUGH AN!) GET RICH—At the
California Theater, Mayfijeld.
This show starts a three-day run
tonight, the reviev/er has not had an
opportunity to see it as yet. The plot
has to do with fake oil stocks in a
company that unexpectedly hits a
gusher, making riches for all. Critics
give the picture a rating of "fair" and
describe it as "good entertainment"
. . . "a laugh riot in spots" . . . "amus-.
ing." However, don't jump all over
the l-eviewer's neck if you don't like it.
