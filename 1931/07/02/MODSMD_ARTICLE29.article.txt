# THREE FACULTY MEN ON ROTARY BOARD
## 
### 
Three members of the Stanford fac- j
| ulty were elected to the new board of i
] directors of the Palo Alto Rotary Club, I
! installed at the regular meeting this j
j week. These men are Professor Edwin |
! A. Cottrell, of the Political Science Do- '
I partment; Professor Yamato Ichihashi, !
5 of the History Department; and Pro
fessor James W. Mcßain, of the Chem- 1
j istry Department.
Cyrus F. Tolman, professor of ge- ;
1 ology, addressed the club on the im- |
; portance of geological surveys in con
: nection with civil engineering. He de
! dared that the St. Francis dam dis
-1 aster several years ago served as a
warning to engineers, who now work
j in conjunction with expert geologists in i
I the construction of dams.

ers of Warner Oland's usual portrayal
iof Charlie Chan, the Chinese super
solver of extraordinary mysteries. His
! supporting cast is mediocre at best.
! Sally Eilers and Marjorie White are
attractive enough but act with a forced
enthusiasm and insincerity .that is re- |
j ally painful in spots; Richard Tucker I
is the male sub-lead, and of course,
he is completely overshadowed by
Oland. A Chinese youth whose name
was not. mentioned on the program,
turns in a good piece of comedy work
j as errand boy for Chan.
The picture has a Hawaiian setting,
! and the camera-man has favored with
i several fine shots of the bay, island |
| vegetation, and surf sports, especially
' the view of the Grand Hawaiian hotel |
taken from a boat quite a distance out 1
j on the water.
A couple of good knife-wielding acts j
! supply the necessary work for Chan, i
I and good directing causes everyone to !
| be suspected but the right one, which j
is, apparently, the correct style for j
mysteries. The Chinese detective's phi- j
I logophic "wise cracks" feature the pic- i
ture throughout.
P.S. —The name fits the show about I
as well as a black camel would fit in
the tropical forests of Hawaii.

Dr. Chao-Chu Wu, minister plenepo
tentiary from the Republic of China to
the United States, has tendered his
resignation to the Nanking government.
