# BYZANTINE RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE THEME OF GREGOIRE'S LECTURE
## Constantinople Princess Takes Part in 5th Century Controversy 
### 
Theological struggles ot the filth cen
tury and the political motives involved,
formed the subject of the lecture given
in French yesterday afternoon by Pro
lessor Henri Gregoire of the University
of Brussels. This was one of the series
of lectures on Byzantine Culture and
Civilization, which is given on each
Wednesday afternoon by Professor
Gregoire.
The lecturer started his description
of tiie religious struggle by reviewing
the regime of Arcadius, the emperor
of Constantinople during the last five
years of the fourth century and the
first eight years of the fifth century.
Pulcheria, the able and learned daugh
ter of the emperor, was fond of theol
ogy and was a strong influence at the
court during the reign of her brother
Theodosius 11, who was emperor from
408 to 450, A.D.
Religious Struggle Begins
It was during his reign that the re
ligious struggle began, according to
Professor Gregoire, who went on to
describe the clash that resulted when
Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople,
contended that the Virgin Mary ought
not to be called the Mother of God,
but simply the Mother of Christ, "thus
imp/ying," he said, "that in his mind
Christ was a man in whom 'Godhead'
came to inhabit 'as in a temple'."
Professor Gregoire described the dis
agreement over this belief of Nesto
rius, and the proclamation of 431 in
which the Virgin Mary was solemnly
proclaimed to be the Mother of God,
although the proclamation was opposed
by Theodosius. The proclamation,
brought about by Cyril, patriarch of
Alexandria, was favored by Pulcheria.
Initial Islam Conquests
The struggle over the "Two Natures"
of Christ, the Divine and the Human,
was carried on after the death of Theo
dosius, in 450, by Pulcheria, his sister,
who summoned the third council of
Chalcedon in 451, in which a provi
sional settlement was made with a
formula acknowledging "Two Natures"
but uniting, without confusion, all dis
tinctions. This caused the Monophysite
revolution in the empire, a revolution
staged by those who objected to the
"Two Natures" theory. The exiled
wife of Theodosius took up the strug
gle in Jerusalem.
"So," concluded Professor Gregoire,
"the great struggle was by no means
appeased, and it was to last for at l째ast
two centuries and ultimately it facili
tated the conquests of Islam."
The next lecture of this series will be
given next Wednesday in the Little
Theatre at 4:15 p.m. The public is in
vited.

court during the reign of her brother
Theodosius 11, who was emperor from
408 to 450, A.D.
Religious Struggle Begins
It was during his reign that the re
ligious struggle began, according to
Professor Gregoire, who went on to
describe the clash that resulted when
Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople,
contended that the Virgin Mary ought
not to be called the Mother of God,
but simply the Mother of Christ, "thus
imp/ying," he said, "that in his mind
Christ was a man in whom 'Godhead'
came to inhabit 'as in a temple'."
Professor Gregoire described the dis
agreement over this belief of Nesto
rius, and the proclamation of 431 in
which the Virgin Mary was solemnly
proclaimed to be the Mother of God,
although the proclamation was opposed
by Theodosius. The proclamation,
brought about by Cyril, patriarch of
Alexandria, was favored by Pulcheria.
Initial Islam Conquests
The struggle over the "Two Natures"
of Christ, the Divine and the Human,
was carried on after the death of Theo
dosius, in 450, by Pulcheria, his sister,
who summoned the third council of
Chalcedon in 451, in which a provi
sional settlement was made with a
formula acknowledging "Two Natures"
but uniting, without confusion, all dis
tinctions. This caused the Monophysite
revolution in the empire, a revolution
staged by those who objected to the
"Two Natures" theory. The exiled
wife of Theodosius took up the strug
gle in Jerusalem.
"So," concluded Professor Gregoire,
"the great struggle was by no means
appeased, and it was to last for at l째ast
two centuries and ultimately it facili
tated the conquests of Islam."
The next lecture of this series will be
given next Wednesday in the Little
Theatre at 4:15 p.m. The public is in

Theological struggles ot the filth cen
tury and the political motives involved,
formed the subject of the lecture given
in French yesterday afternoon by Pro
lessor Henri Gregoire of the University
of Brussels. This was one of the series
of lectures on Byzantine Culture and
Civilization, which is given on each
Wednesday afternoon by Professor
Gregoire.
The lecturer started his description
of tiie religious struggle by reviewing
the regime of Arcadius, the emperor
of Constantinople during the last five
years of the fourth century and the
first eight years of the fifth century.
Pulcheria, the able and learned daugh
ter of the emperor, was fond of theol
ogy and was a strong influence at the
court during the reign of her brother
Theodosius 11, who was emperor from
408 to 450, A.D.
