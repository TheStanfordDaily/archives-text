# MANY FROM "FARM" IN R. O. T. C. CAMPS
## 
### 
Eighty-three Stanford military stu
dents are enrolled in the R.O.T.C. sum
mer training camps this year—half
again the number that enrolled for the
summer of 1930.
Fifty-eight men under Captain E. C.
Williams, senior officer for 1931, arc
encamped at the Del Monto Oordinance
Camp. Twenty-five men in the Stan
ford Field Artillery are training at
Fort Lewis, Wash. Both camps opened
June 16, and will close July 28.

Prejudice comes from strangeness
and lack of understanding.—George
Gordon Battle.
