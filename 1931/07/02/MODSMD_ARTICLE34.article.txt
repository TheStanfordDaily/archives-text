# SLONAKER CONTINUES EXPERIMENTS: 1.500 RATS DIGEST $4.50 PER DAY
## 
### 
James Rollin Slonaker, professor of
physiology, plans to continue his quar
ter-century study of white rats after
his retirement from active duty in Au
gust.
For the past four years Professor
Slonaker has been conducting an ex
periment in the determination of the
proper amount of protein food material
to be utilized by an animal body. This
study was begun with ninety pairs of
white rats divided into live groups
under controlled conditions of atmos
phere, sanitation, and diet. A study of
humans under these definitely con
trolled conditions would be of greater
value but impossible to carry out, ac
cording to Professor Slonaker.
Feed Costs $4.50 a Day
Today there live the descendants of
these first matingsâ€”still being main
tained under the very same conditions.
Efficiency of the various diets is meas
ured by the amount of exercise taken
as recorded by counters attached to re
volving cages. He is also studying the
effect of the different protein diets on
the fertility, growth, the size of the
litters, and'the longevity of the ani
mals through several generations.
During these last four years the
number of rats has increased from the

| original 180 until now there are about
1,500 inclosed in nearly 80 revolving
j cages and many stationary ones,
j The feeding problem is one that has
' caused Professor Slonaker much con
cern. Each day these 1,500 rats con
sume $4.50 worth of meat scrap, pow
dered milk, corn starch, corn meal,
casein, yeast, butter, whole wheat,
germ, alfalfa leaves, and salts.
Would Experiment Another Year
| Until recently outside sources have
i been supporting this experiment; but
j this has been cut off to a great extent,
! thus forcing Professor Slonaker to look
j to others for help. At present the ce-
I reals and yeast are being donated by
j prominent manufacturing concerns. It
I is hoped to. be able (o raise other do
| nations in money and food supplies so
! that the experiment may be assured of
! running at least another year.
Results to date have shown that a
diet containing about 14 per cent pro
i tein material is best for the rats. When
I asked what relation this result bore to
j humans, Professor Slonaker said, "The
i physiology of digestion in the rat and
1 man are so similar that physiological
i principles demonstrated by experiment
: in one could be reasonably expected
j to apply to the other species as well."
