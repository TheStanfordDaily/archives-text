"Stanford janitorial service is better
than that of similar institutions in Ore
gon," says J. M. Brown, campus rep
resentative of the American Building
Maintenance Company, an organization
which furnishes janitor service for all
university buildings.
Brown has recently returned from
Oregon, where he inspected the jani
torial service in all of the state insti
tutions.
Eleven years ago Stanford Univer
sity began to contract for janitor ser
vice and, as Brown pointed out, the
experiment must have been a success,
as the contract is binding only while
the service is of merit.
Of the fifty' odd janitors employed
here, 46 are accommodated in living
quarters next to the Power House, and
the others either live in one or another
of the various halls, where they act
as guardians of University property.
Of this crew of men 50 per cent have
been here at least five years, and one,
Harry Satamura, h&s been here prac
tically the entire time the university
has been in existence. Satamura also
has the distinction of having been
house-boy for President Harrison and
David Starr Jordan.
There are also several students work
ing part time as janitors. According to
Brown this is a comparatively narrow
field of student activity here in Cali
fornia; but in Oregon it is the stand
ard situation.
