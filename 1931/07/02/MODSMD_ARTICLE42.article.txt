# BEER WINS PRINCETON FAVORITE DRINK QUIZ
## 
### 
"What ax-e the 'cinch' courses,"
"what are the dullest courses," and
"what is your favorite beverage"? were
among the queries in a recent ques
tionnaire answered by the Princeton
seniors.
Elements of Economics and Inti'oduc
tion to Philosophy tied for the dullest
course, with Evolution coming under
the wire just a length behind. Artil
lery was the favorite "cinch course,"
while Modern Europe was voted the
most difficult.
Beer won easily in the "favorite bev
erage" contest, with prohibition re
ceiving the short end of a 40 to 363
vote.
Their preference of scholastic as
against athletic honors, was confirmed
when the students voted 266 to 98 in
favor of the former. Less than one
half of the class considered education
as important in university experience
as "contacts."
