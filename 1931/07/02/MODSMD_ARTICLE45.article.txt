# AMERICANS LEAD IN MODERN PHILOSOPHY SAYS PROF. SAVERY
## Peirce, James, and Dewey Are Outstanding Exponents Of New Schools 
### 
j Thai the most philosophical thinking
in the last fifty years has been clone
j by Americans, is the opinion of Wil
j liarn Savery, visiting professor of phi
j losophy from the University of Wash
j ington. He continued:
j ington.
I "Charles Peirce, William James, and
j John Dewey are the outstanding ex
| ponents of philosophy in America. In
i Cambridge, England, important philo
j sophical work is being done by a bril-
I liant group of men, of whom Bertrand
| Russell, perhaps the most important
! living philosophex*, is one.
j "On the continent of Europe much
j less has occurred in the way of new
j thought; the thinkers there are going
j over the old things again and again.
' Pragmatism an Important New Theory
"One of the important new theories
in philosophy is Pragmatism. Charles
Peirce set forth u new Pragmatic
method, and this was developed by
William James into Pragmatism, a new
and brilliant theory of truth."
It was suggested that the revival of
realism is another step forward in mod -
ern thought. While the first half of
I the nineteenth century was idealistic
and the latter half positivistic or ag
' nostic, in the twentieth century the
j trend is toward realism. This also is
! due largely to William James.
I "James also invented a new plu
ralism, which he calls concatenism or
the theory that realities are linked as
in a chain," said Savery.
Studied Under William James
"Tychism or the theory that the uni
verse has arisen by chance is another
great contribution to philosophy by-
Charles Peirce. The Quantum theory in
; physics gts in with this conception.
"These four conceptions are mainly
the creations of American philoso
phers."
Professor Savery studied under Wil
j liam James at Harvard and received
I his master's and doctor's degree from
»that university. He was graduated
] from Brown University and has been
I on the staff of the Department of Phi
: losophy at Fairmount College and the
; University of Washington. During pre
vious summer sessions Dr. Savery has

j Thai the most philosophical thinking
in the last fifty years has been clone
j by Americans, is the opinion of Wil
j liarn Savery, visiting professor of phi
j losophy from the University of Wash
j ington. He continued:
j ington.
I "Charles Peirce, William James, and
j John Dewey are the outstanding ex
| ponents of philosophy in America. In
i Cambridge, England, important philo
j sophical work is being done by a bril-
I liant group of men, of whom Bertrand
| Russell, perhaps the most important
! living philosophex*, is one.
j "On the continent of Europe much
j less has occurred in the way of new
j thought; the thinkers there are going
j over the old things again and again.
' Pragmatism an Important New Theory
"One of the important new theories
in philosophy is Pragmatism. Charles
Peirce set forth u new Pragmatic
method, and this was developed by
William James into Pragmatism, a new
and brilliant theory of truth."
It was suggested that the revival of
realism is another step forward in mod -
ern thought. While the first half of
I the nineteenth century was idealistic
and the latter half positivistic or ag
' nostic, in the twentieth century the
j trend is toward realism. This also is
! due largely to William James.
I "James also invented a new plu
ralism, which he calls concatenism or
the theory that realities are linked as
in a chain," said Savery.
Studied Under William James
"Tychism or the theory that the uni
verse has arisen by chance is another
great contribution to philosophy by-
Charles Peirce. The Quantum theory in
; physics gts in with this conception.
"These four conceptions are mainly
the creations of American philoso
phers."
Professor Savery studied under Wil
j liam James at Harvard and received
I his master's and doctor's degree from
»that university. He was graduated
] from Brown University and has been
I on the staff of the Department of Phi
: losophy at Fairmount College and the
; University of Washington. During pre
vious summer sessions Dr. Savery has
| taught at Harvard, the University of
I California, at Berkeley, and at Los An
geles, the University of Oregon, and
l the University of Pennsylvania.
