# HOME AND HOME PACT WITH NORTHWESTERN SEALED BY STANFORD
## 
### 
That Northwestern University will
: be on Stanford's 1932 and 1933 football
schedules is assured as the result of
I a communication just received from
1 Coach Dick Hanley by Graduate Man
! ager AI Masters. The first game is to
| bo played in the Stanford Stadium, Oc
i tober 8, 1932, and the second encounter
will be in Dysche Stadium, Evanston,
Illinois, October 14, 1933.
This new home and home agreement
! will bring together two teams using
I the same style of play. Coach Dick
! Hanley has long been an advocate of
| the Warner system, and every year he
I manages to put a powerful team on
j the field.
With the coming of the Northwest
j ern Wildcats to Palo Alto, the West
i should be provided with another great
intersectional battle. Hanley's men al
i ways play a fast and colorful game,
I and with Stanford's wide open style
! of play, a real struggle should be the
| result.
This arrangement is the following
! out of Stanford's plan to have a pow
! erful Midwestern team on its schedule
j each year. Next year will see the com
j pletion of the two-year agreement with
Minnesota. These Midwestern teams
are played in the middle of the season
and an Eastern team is met following
the "Big Game." Dartmouth is that
team the coming season.
