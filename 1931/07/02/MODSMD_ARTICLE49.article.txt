# POST-GATTY FLIGHT HAS SMALL VALUE THINKS M'MURTRY
## Safety, Not Speed, Is Need Of Modern Aviation Says Aviator 
### 
Expressing the belief that the Post-
Gatty nine-day globe circling feat,
which ended in New York last night,
has little bearing on the progress of
aviation, L. B. McMurtry, sales man
ager of the Stanford Aviation Field,
stated that in his opinion such flights
are "nonsense" and based largely upon
sheer, luck. He thinks that in reality
they are of no more value to the avia
tion world "than a new speed record
in eating a seven-course dinner would
be to the Chef's Union."
He bases his view on the fact that
at the present time the aviation world
is more concerned with safety than
with speed, and that such flights played
up as they are in the newspapers with
the element of danger ever brought to
the fore only lead the public to veer
from adopting aviation on a plane with
motoring.
McMurtry further stated that the en
durance feature of the flight is of little
note for there are many motors manu
factured which are capable of sus
tained flight of many days as was
proved by the endurance flights of the
past year.
Being questioned as to his opinion
of the auto-gyro, McMurtry stated that
this invention, one of the first experi
ments in the field of aviation, might
have a tremendous bearing on the de
velopment of safe flying.
