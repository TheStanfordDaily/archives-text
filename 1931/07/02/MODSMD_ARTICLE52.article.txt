# TAXES FOR SCHOOLS NOT A BURDEN. SAYS COMMISSIONER WILEY

### 
"School taxes are emphatically not
a burden," declared Professor George
M. Wiley, when interviewed yesterday,
concerning the claim that has been
made in some quarters to the effect
that schools have tended to overtax
the people. Dr. Wiley is Assistant
Commissioner of Education for the
State of New York and acting profes

handicapped by old traditions and the
conservatism of its people. There are
some who disapprove of the junior
college because they believe that uni
versities should be open only to a se
lect few, and there are others who look
upon it merely as an elementary school
and not a college
Professor Wiley explained that there
are two types of junior colleges in the
East. One is intended as a finishing
school for those who wish to go only
two years to college. The other is used
as a lower division, whose curricula
must conform with that of the higher
institutions, and from which students
may enter these major universities.
"However slowly, the junior college
movement is progressing. It will in
crease the number of people who go to
college," Professor Wiley continued.
"A generation ago a boy could count
on his fingers the different fields for
which he might prepare. Today there
are more opportunities than he can
think of, let alone count.
"As our plan of life becomes more
complex so will our educational sys
