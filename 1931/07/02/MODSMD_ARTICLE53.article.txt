# REOPEN CAMPUS ROAD; OILED AND SURFACED
## 
### 
The road leading past Branner Hall
into Mayfield and South Palo Alto
was reopened last night, after having
been closed for a number of days for
scraping, surfacing, and oiling opera
tions. Although the road is again Apen
for travel, Traffic Officer Gordon Da
vis advises motorists to drive slowly
in order to avoid splashing the fresh
oil.

During spring quarter the road was
surfaced twice, but heavy traffic soon
produced many uneven places and
even chuck holes. Now that the road
has been put in good shape and oiled,
Roy Button, superintendent of build
ings and grounds, expects it to stay in
condition all summer.

The road back of Toyon and Bran
ner Halls has just recently been scraped
and graveled, and at the present time
is in fair condition.
