A grass fire Wednesday morning at
1:15 burning near the Ryan high volt
age laboratory did little damage. Fire
Chief R. E. Dugan, of the Stanford Fire
Department, believes the fire to have
been of incendiary origin, as it is un
likely that a burning cigarette might
have started the blaze, because of the
comparatively high humidity of the
early morning.
