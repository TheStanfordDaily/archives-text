# "The Inspector General" Ranked As Best Satire; Analyzes Russian People
## 
### 
In "The Inspector-General," which
will be presented in the Stanford As
sembly Hall on July 10, Nikolai Gogol
established realism as a tradition of the
Russian drama. Gogol had failed as
actor, poet, and history lecturer, and
finally succeeded as the first great
analyst of the Russian soul, in his short
stories, and especially in this play.

"Revizor," as the play is called in
Russia, is the greatest of Russian come
dies, and gained for its author the dis

tinction of being Russia's greatest hu
morist. It was the first master-comedy
in the Russian language, and after a
century, is still the master comedy.
A Satire on Bureaucracy
"The Inspector-General" is a bril
liant satire on bureaucracy, though it
is an error to look on its political and
historical significance as its principal
claim to rank among the great come
dies of the continent, for in any lan
guage it is recognized as pure and uni
versal comedy.

Though Gogol is ridiculing the
wretched state of political corruption
in Russian officialdom, still he has the
satirist's indulgent attitude toward the
objects of his satire. The characters
arc drawn very humanly. He does not
attack their corruption as wickedness,
but as their primary and human weak
ness.

Gogol understands the humanity of
evil, and his characters are never evil
monsters, but wretched, yet thor
oughly human, fools and knaves. The
qualities of the petty officials, with
their snobbery, their graft, and their
knavish braggadocio, can best be em
phasized by the use of caricature.
Lying Is Hlestakov's Art
The central figure in the play, Hles
takov, who will be played in the cam
pus production by Paul Speegle, is only
a young man, a shallow person with
many humanly good qualities. He is
a liar, but not a deliberate one. Lying
is his art, the thing which he does best
and most sincerely. He almost be
lieves what he says, and in' his false
inventions he reveals what he himself
is, a charming fool, and not a deliberate
cheat.
This light political satire, when it was
presented for the first time in 183G,
was received with enthusiasm by the
intelligentsia, and with horror by the
official classes, who conspired to keep
it off the boards. Unfortunately for
them, it had caught the fancy of the
Czar Nicholas, who laughed at its per
formance. Later the Czar and the en
tire government were to turn against
literary realism.
