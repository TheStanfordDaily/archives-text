# WATER CONSERVATION ON CAMPUS NESESSARY
## 
### 
Reiterating the warning to campus
residents that water used for irriga
tion purposes must be conserved, As
sistant Comptroller A. L. Trowbridge
today stated that the University water
supply is lower than at any time since
1917. Though there is little danger
that the supply of water for domestic
purposes will be endangered during the
summer, the two lakes in which water
for irrigation is stored are so low that
any unforseen exigencies might make
it necessary to cease all irrigation.

Felt and Scarsville lakes, from which
water for campus irrigation is secured
are at present less than half filled with
water, which, according to Trowbridge
must serve to water the University
grounds until December. Wells which
augment this supply are slowly becom
ing dry and unless great care is taken
it may be necessary to forbid the use
of water for any purposes other than
drinking and bathing.
