# Russian Scenery To Be Feature Of Drama
## New Stage Technique Will Be Featured 
### 
"The Inspector-General," which will
be presented in the Assembly Hall on
| Friday evening, is to be done in the
Continental manner, both settings .;nd
costumes reflecting the Russia of a
century ago, a Russia influenced by
Paris, especially where the dictates of
fashion in dress are concerned.
The furnishings of the first act center
around a continental stove, which is
used to give atmosphere to the setting.
| The set, which is a room in the mayor's
j house, will be done in a neutral green
and mulberry, according to Frederick
j Stover, stage technical director,
i Unique in stage technique at Stan
i ford, and reminiscent of real wagon
stages, is the device by which the en
tire back of the first set can be wheeled
: away to allow a new set to be wheeled
j in on rollers inside the first set, mak-
I ing for greater facility and speed in
j changing of scenes.
In the first scene of the second act,
I '
I a room at an inn is depicted. It is a
I small room under a staircase. Stover
| has designed an arrangement whereby
| the audience will be able to see the
action on the stairs and in the hall, as
well as that taking place in the room.
The sets have been designed to fit the
action of the play.
Tickets will go on sale at 1 o'clock
today in front of the Women's Club
! house.
