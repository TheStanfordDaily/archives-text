# "BAWLOUT" GIVES ENROLLMENT DATA OF CURRENT TERM
## Undergraduates Exceeded By Graduate Students 
### 
The Directory of Officers and Stu
dents for the Summer Quarter has been
published and is on sale at the Comp
troller's office for fifteen cents. Com
monly called the "Bawlout" because it
reveals the grade point status of all
students, the directory does not contain
the telltale figures which are being
held for the University Register, pub
lished in August.

According to directory figures cor
rected to date, enrollment for this
quarter totals 1,123, approximately
one-third of enrollment for regular
quarters. There are nearly one and a
half times as many graduates as un
dergraduates for the summer while
ordinarily postgraduates are outnum
bered three to one.

Graduates outnumber the rest in
nearly every department and in Educa
tion there are 294 of them to only 17
undergraduates. Only in Economics do
the undergraduates hold an appreciable
majority with 69 as compared to 18
graduates.

Although of vital interest and im
portance to a small proportion of stu
dents, the directory does not tell how
many men are competing for admission
with the quota of 50 for the Autumn
Quarter. Competition statistics have not
yet been compiled, but will be when
the Registrar's office sends out inquiry
cards in about two weeks. However,
competing students may deduct some
thing from the fact that there are 150
Lower Division students. There are 270
upperclassmen.

There are 117 in the Academic Coun
cil for the Summer Quarter, including
76 professors, 28 associate professors,
and 13 assistant professors.

Geographically, Stanford students
represent 38 states, Alaska, the Philip
pines, and nine foreign countries. Cali
fornia has 730 students here—more
than the* number of representatives
from all other places combined.

Other miscellaneous information in
the directory includes a telephone di
rectory of Stanford phones and a key
to fire signals.
