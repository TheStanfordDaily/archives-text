# SUMMER QUARTER PER-PERSON FOOD RATIONS EXCEED "NORMAL"
## 
### 
Do summer sessiorvstudents cat more
than the regular quarter students?
This question has puzzled some of
I the best "mooters" on the campus, who,
i in this issue of the Daily, reveal the
j results of their calculations.
Dean Torrence, who is directing the
I provision of the gastronomical delights
| offered by the Beta house during the
j summer, answers "yes" emphatically.
McLeod, co-director with Torrence, is
more conservative, but still awards the
decision to the hot-weather gang.
Opposing the Beta declarations are
T. C. Cartwright, calorie artist in charge
of the S.A.E. diet, and Parker Reed, of
j the Recd-Hables combine at El Toro.
Both claim that the summer students
1 possess no more voracious appetites
' than the regulars.
Undergraduates Heaviest Eaters
The Union enters the combat with
( satistical evidence, the comparative
, sales of this and last summer, which
seem to lend credibility to the S.A.E.
| and El Toro arguments. However, most
of their punches arc pulled when the
1 Union adds that it believes the lesser
capacity of the present group is due
I largely to numbers and not to gastric
passions.
Torrence supports his statements by
declaring, "About seventy per cent of
the men here demolish 'seconds' of the
I main course." "And," he adds sorrow
fully, "Nearly forty per cent of them
I stow away 'seconds' of everything."
j McLeod disturbs his partner's sad
| reverie with the lament, "Well, only

100 per cent call for double desserts.'"
After due consideration the pair de
termined that the undergraduates are
the strongest eaters. The graduates,
possibly the result of several years of
grocery buying for quantity consump
tion, seem to be easier on the food.
Lighter Food When It's llot
The undergrads, it is claimed, fre
quent the plunge, the tennis courts, and
the golf links more than the older men
do. This is said by many reputable
dieticians to induce a more capacious
appetite than the quieter pursuit of
wisdom via the textbooks.
Parker Reed, of El Toro, declares
the comparative capacities to be about
the same.
"They're not any worse than the
regular crowd," he defended, when in
terviewed.
"No," in response to a query, "not
many ask for 'seconds.' By the time
dessert is served most of them are
about filled up, so there aren't many
'seconds' there either."
The S.A.E. information was received
from T. C. Cartwright, who issued
much the same facts as announced by
El Toro.
"We give them a lighter food when
it's so hot. Lots of salads and drinks,"
declared Cartwright. Pondering a mo
ment, he concluded, "There were so
many absent over the week-end that
we don't know just how this last hot
spell would have affected the squad.'
So the moot question still lingers.

which is the best calorie puncher?

seem to lend credibility to the S.A.E.
| and El Toro arguments. However, most
of their punches arc pulled when the
1 Union adds that it believes the lesser
capacity of the present group is due
I largely to numbers and not to gastric
passions.
Torrence supports his statements by
declaring, "About seventy per cent of
the men here demolish 'seconds' of the
I main course." "And," he adds sorrow
fully, "Nearly forty per cent of them
I stow away 'seconds' of everything."
j McLeod disturbs his partner's sad
| reverie with the lament, "Well, only

100 per cent call for double desserts.'"
After due consideration the pair de
termined that the undergraduates are
the strongest eaters. The graduates,
possibly the result of several years of
grocery buying for quantity consump
tion, seem to be easier on the food.
Lighter Food When It's llot
The undergrads, it is claimed, fre
quent the plunge, the tennis courts, and
the golf links more than the older men
do. This is said by many reputable
dieticians to induce a more capacious
appetite than the quieter pursuit of
wisdom via the textbooks.
Parker Reed, of El Toro, declares
the comparative capacities to be about
the same.
"They're not any worse than the
regular crowd," he defended, when in
terviewed.
"No," in response to a query, "not
many ask for 'seconds.' By the time
dessert is served most of them are
about filled up, so there aren't many
'seconds' there either."
The S.A.E. information was received
from T. C. Cartwright, who issued
much the same facts as announced by
El Toro.
"We give them a lighter food when
it's so hot. Lots of salads and drinks,"
declared Cartwright. Pondering a mo
ment, he concluded, "There were so
many absent over the week-end that
we don't know just how this last hot
spell would have affected the squad.'
So the moot question still lingers.
Summer or regular, grad or undergrad,
which is the best calorie puncher?
Do summer sessiorvstudents cat more
than the regular quarter students?
This question has puzzled some of
I the best "mooters" on the campus, who,
i in this issue of the Daily, reveal the
j results of their calculations.
Dean Torrence, who is directing the
I provision of the gastronomical delights
| offered by the Beta house during the
j summer, answers "yes" emphatically.
McLeod, co-director with Torrence, is
more conservative, but still awards the
decision to the hot-weather gang.
Opposing the Beta declarations are
T. C. Cartwright, calorie artist in charge
of the S.A.E. diet, and Parker Reed, of
j the Recd-Hables combine at El Toro.
Both claim that the summer students
1 possess no more voracious appetites
' than the regulars.
