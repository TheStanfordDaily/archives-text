# Consul von Hentig Lectures Here Tonight
## Motion Picture Travelogue To Feature Germany 
### 
Experiences in the World War will
be related tonight by Dr. W. O. von
Hentig, German consul general of San
Francisco, at the regular Tuesday night
lecture in the Little Theatre. Von Hen
tig's talk will be introductory to a mo
tion picture travelogue, "Beautiful
Germany," which is scheduled to start
at 8 o'clock.

The travelogue first depicts scenes
from Hamburg, then moves east to East
and West Prussia and journeys south
to Silesia and Bavaria, visiting the pic
turesque Lake Constance region, where
the famous Zeppelins are constructed,
and returns north along the Rhine val
ley and the industrial districts of the
Rhineland. It gives the observer not
only a bird's eye view of the country,
but also a glimpse of present-day eco
nomic, industrial, and social life of
Germany. This picture was shown here
during the spring quarter. Since the
auditorium could not accommodate the
crowd, it is being repeated by request.

Von Hentig's experiences in the re
cent war have been published in a
book, "Ins VerschlofTene Land." Kurt
Frank Reinhifrdt, assistant professor
of German, said today, "Von Hentig is
well known not only nationally but in
ternationally, having been in the Ger
man diplomatic service for a good
many years. He has occupied posts in
Esthonia, the Balkans, and Posen, and
lately has become widely known in
Germany for his activity in the Ger
man youth movement.

"During the war," Dr. Rinehart con
tinued, "he had an important mission
to perform as Germany tried to force
England to make peace by attacking
her politically and diplomatically in
her Oriental possessions. In 1915 about
forty German army officers and other
attaches under the leadership of von
Hentig were ordered to proceed to
Afghanistan. The idea was to reach
India, then go on to Egypt by the Suez
canal, or at least to block the Suez.
"In his book von Hentig describes
the terrible sufferings endured on the
march through the desert and on ar
rival in Afghanistan how he accom
plished the dangerous and difficult task
entrusted him by the foreign office of
establishing a diplomatic relationship
with the Emir, resulting in the Ger
man-Afghanistan commercial treaty.
"They carried into Afghanistan the
idea of independence and autonomy,
which brought about the ardent de
sire for an independent kingdom, which
became a reality a few years later.
"However, to carry on further ac
tivities it was necessary for von Hentig
to communicate with the outside world
and the nearest telegraph post was un
der British control and administration
at Kashgar in Chinese-Turkestan. At
tended only bya n Arabian and a Tur
kotatar, he started for Kashgar to es
tablish a wire connection with the
German legation in Peking; but the
Chinese, under Russian and British in
fluence, turned against him, and his life
was saved only by the interference of
a Chinese missionary.
"It is to a large extent due to the
work of von Hentig that today Afghan
istan is a respected kingdom with con
siderable cultural achievements re
flecting European civilization," con
cluded Reinhardt.

tion picture travelogue, "Beautiful
Germany," which is scheduled to start
at 8 o'clock.

The travelogue first depicts scenes
from Hamburg, then moves east to East
and West Prussia and journeys south
to Silesia and Bavaria, visiting the pic
turesque Lake Constance region, where
the famous Zeppelins are constructed,
and returns north along the Rhine val
ley and the industrial districts of the
Rhineland. It gives the observer not
only a bird's eye view of the country,
but also a glimpse of present-day eco
nomic, industrial, and social life of
Germany. This picture was shown here
during the spring quarter. Since the
auditorium could not accommodate the
crowd, it is being repeated by request.

Von Hentig's experiences in the re
cent war have been published in a
book, "Ins VerschlofTene Land." Kurt
Frank Reinhifrdt, assistant professor
of German, said today, "Von Hentig is
well known not only nationally but in
ternationally, having been in the Ger
man diplomatic service for a good
many years. He has occupied posts in
Esthonia, the Balkans, and Posen, and
lately has become widely known in
Germany for his activity in the Ger
man youth movement.

"During the war," Dr. Rinehart con
tinued, "he had an important mission
to perform as Germany tried to force
England to make peace by attacking
her politically and diplomatically in
her Oriental possessions. In 1915 about
forty German army officers and other
attaches under the leadership of von
Hentig were ordered to proceed to
Afghanistan. The idea was to reach
India, then go on to Egypt by the Suez
canal, or at least to block the Suez.
"In his book von Hentig describes
the terrible sufferings endured on the
march through the desert and on ar
rival in Afghanistan how he accom
plished the dangerous and difficult task
entrusted him by the foreign office of
establishing a diplomatic relationship
with the Emir, resulting in the Ger
man-Afghanistan commercial treaty.
"They carried into Afghanistan the
idea of independence and autonomy,
which brought about the ardent de
sire for an independent kingdom, which
became a reality a few years later.
"However, to carry on further ac
tivities it was necessary for von Hentig
to communicate with the outside world
and the nearest telegraph post was un
der British control and administration
at Kashgar in Chinese-Turkestan. At
tended only bya n Arabian and a Tur
kotatar, he started for Kashgar to es
tablish a wire connection with the
German legation in Peking; but the
Chinese, under Russian and British in
fluence, turned against him, and his life
was saved only by the interference of
a Chinese missionary.
"It is to a large extent due to the
work of von Hentig that today Afghan
istan is a respected kingdom with con
siderable cultural achievements re
flecting European civilization," con
cluded Reinhardt.
Experiences in the World War will
be related tonight by Dr. W. O. von
Hentig, German consul general of San
Francisco, at the regular Tuesday night
lecture in the Little Theatre. Von Hen
