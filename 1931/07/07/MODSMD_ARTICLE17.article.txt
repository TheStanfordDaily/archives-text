# FAMOUS POET DARIO IS SUBJECT OF TALK BY TORRES-RIOSECO
## 
### 
j "Ruben Dario is not only one of the
| greatest poets of the Spanish language,
1 but certainly the most distinguished
'and cultured poet Spanish-America has
! ever produced," said Professor Arturo
I Torres-Rioseco of the University of
California last night in the third of
' the series of Spanish lectures which
! he has given this summer.
"While Dario was born in Nicaragua,
he spent most of his life, studying and
writing in Paris, and thus became an
: excellent interpreter of French culture
i and ideas in Spanish America," con
tinued Torres-Rioseco.
"Dario not only was well versed in
French, but he had a considerable
! knowledge of many foreign languages
! and literatures, including the Ameri
( can, and he wrote a great many essays
; on North America. His essay on Edgar
[ Allan Poe is perhaps one of the best
ever written in any tongue on this
American poet.
"In the United States, Dario has
achieved prominence, mainly for his
poem, 'To Roosevelt,' in which lie eulo
j gizes President Roosevelt for his dy
| namic temperament, but condemns his
political interference in Colombia and
' Panama. Similar to that of Rodo is this
bard's attitude toward the United
States in so far as Dario strives to
j create for South America a civilization
J combining the beauty of Greece with
1 the ideals of Christianity," continued
i Rioseco.
In his analysis of the work of the
poet, Dr. Rioseco illustrated his points
with readings from some of Dario's
! well-known poetry.
The last of the series of lectures on
Spanish-American culture will be de
livered at 8 o'clock next Monday night
|at the Little Theatre, and Professor
I Rioseco announced he would speak in
I English on "The Spanish-American
Woman at Home and in Society."
