# ACCLAIM HARTY IN HILLSBOROUGH SUNDAY CONCERT
## Stanford's "Irish Symphony" Given Best Greeting By Audience Dr. Artur Rodzinski Coming Sunday as Third Guest Conductor 
### Staff Reviewer 
It was not Sir Hamilton llarty's bril
liant interpretation of Handel's "Water
Music" or of Brahms' "Second Sym
phony" that captivated the audience at
the symphony concert at Hillsborough
last Sunday. It was the "Irish Sym
phony in D Minor" by Charles Villiers
Stanford that won the greatest acclaim.
Perhaps because Harty himself seemed
to enjoy this number most, perhaps be
cause the audience was more familiar
with the other numbers, it was so well
received.

The Irish symphony, built on cer
tain themes taken from the music of
the conductor's native land, is based on
three melodies. Two of the melodies are
spirited dances in allegro time played
with an exciting tyinpani accompani
ment. The third theme is a beautiful
adagio introduced by the cellos. The
melody is a tenderly beautiful folk
song, "Emir's Farewell to Cuchullain."
Especially interesting was the finale of
the rhapsody. The third theme is being
developed vivaciously by the whole
orchestra, but it is stopped suddenly a
few bars before the end, and the open
ing notes of the first theme conclude
the piece.
Sir Harty's own arrangement of "The
Water Music" by Handel opened the
concert. This music, written by Handel
for a barge party given by George I,
consists of "gay or soothing songs and
spirited dances alternating with fan
fares from the brass secfion." Harty has
taken six of the original twenty num
bers for his arrangement. They form a
well-contrasted set of movements in
which the flavor of the Handelian or
chestra is preserved.
Brahms' second symphony, the so
called "Pastoral symphony," has a
quiet, melodic quality that is delight
ful to hear. Strings and woodwinds
alternate with the melody, the full or
chestra occasionally rising to tumultu
ous chords. The adagio movement of
this symphony is especially interesting
for its apparent series of questions and
answers. Although there are some re-

plies to the plaintive, questioning
