# ACCLAIM HARTY IN HILLSBOROUGH SUNDAY CONCERT
## Stanford's "Irish Symphony" Given Best Greeting By Audience Dr. Artur Rodzinski Coming Sunday as Third Guest Conductor 
### Staff Reviewer 
It was not Sir Hamilton llarty's bril
liant interpretation of Handel's "Water
Music" or of Brahms' "Second Sym
phony" that captivated the audience at
the symphony concert at Hillsborough
last Sunday. It was the "Irish Sym
phony in D Minor" by Charles Villiers
Stanford that won the greatest acclaim.
Perhaps because Harty himself seemed
to enjoy this number most, perhaps be
cause the audience was more familiar
with the other numbers, it was so well
received.

The Irish symphony, built on cer
tain themes taken from the music of
the conductor's native land, is based on
three melodies. Two of the melodies are
spirited dances in allegro time played
with an exciting tyinpani accompani
ment. The third theme is a beautiful
adagio introduced by the cellos. The
melody is a tenderly beautiful folk
song, "Emir's Farewell to Cuchullain."
Especially interesting was the finale of
the rhapsody. The third theme is being
developed vivaciously by the whole
orchestra, but it is stopped suddenly a
few bars before the end, and the open
ing notes of the first theme conclude
the piece.
Sir Harty's own arrangement of "The
Water Music" by Handel opened the
concert. This music, written by Handel
for a barge party given by George I,
consists of "gay or soothing songs and
spirited dances alternating with fan
fares from the brass secfion." Harty has
taken six of the original twenty num
bers for his arrangement. They form a
well-contrasted set of movements in
which the flavor of the Handelian or
chestra is preserved.
Brahms' second symphony, the so
called "Pastoral symphony," has a
quiet, melodic quality that is delight
ful to hear. Strings and woodwinds
alternate with the melody, the full or
chestra occasionally rising to tumultu
ous chords. The adagio movement of
this symphony is especially interesting
for its apparent series of questions and
answers. Although there are some re-

plies to the plaintive, questioning
parts, the movement ends without any
satisfactory solution given.
A living English composer, Frederick
Delius, is the composer of '"The Walk
to Paradise Garden" which followed
the Irish rhapsody in the second half
of the program. The composition tells
the story of two lovers who come to a
tragic end. The music is wistful, ten
der, gradually sinking to despair. The
death of the two lovers is described in
the gradual fadin'g out of the last sor
rowful chord.
The colorful music of Berlioz's "Le
Carnaval Romain" concluded the pro
gram. This selection was written as
the overture to an opera entitled "Ben
venuto Cellini," and one of the main
themes in the piece is a song of Col
lin's played by the English horn. Other
themes developed in the number are
a wild dance, the Saltarello, and a song
of Cellini's followers played in allegro
vivace.
Sir Harty is a pleasing conductor, a
smile often breaking over his face as
he beckons to the various groups of
players to swell the music with their
contribution. His movements are spon
taneous and free, revealing an emo
tional as well as a rational understand
ing of the score.
The third guest conductor for the
summer series will be Dr. Artur Rod-

zinski, conductor of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra. He will con
duct on July 12 and 19.

consists of "gay or soothing songs and
spirited dances alternating with fan
fares from the brass secfion." Harty has
taken six of the original twenty num
bers for his arrangement. They form a
well-contrasted set of movements in
which the flavor of the Handelian or
chestra is preserved.
Brahms' second symphony, the so
called "Pastoral symphony," has a
quiet, melodic quality that is delight
ful to hear. Strings and woodwinds
alternate with the melody, the full or
chestra occasionally rising to tumultu
ous chords. The adagio movement of
this symphony is especially interesting
for its apparent series of questions and
answers. Although there are some re-

plies to the plaintive, questioning
parts, the movement ends without any
satisfactory solution given.
A living English composer, Frederick
Delius, is the composer of '"The Walk
to Paradise Garden" which followed
the Irish rhapsody in the second half
of the program. The composition tells
the story of two lovers who come to a
tragic end. The music is wistful, ten
der, gradually sinking to despair. The
death of the two lovers is described in
the gradual fadin'g out of the last sor
rowful chord.
The colorful music of Berlioz's "Le
Carnaval Romain" concluded the pro
gram. This selection was written as
the overture to an opera entitled "Ben
venuto Cellini," and one of the main
themes in the piece is a song of Col
lin's played by the English horn. Other
themes developed in the number are
a wild dance, the Saltarello, and a song
of Cellini's followers played in allegro
vivace.
Sir Harty is a pleasing conductor, a
smile often breaking over his face as
he beckons to the various groups of
players to swell the music with their
contribution. His movements are spon
taneous and free, revealing an emo
tional as well as a rational understand
ing of the score.
The third guest conductor for the
summer series will be Dr. Artur Rod-

zinski, conductor of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra. He will con
duct on July 12 and 19.
It was not Sir Hamilton llarty's bril
liant interpretation of Handel's "Water
Music" or of Brahms' "Second Sym
phony" that captivated the audience at
the symphony concert at Hillsborough
last Sunday. It was the "Irish Sym
phony in D Minor" by Charles Villiers
Stanford that won the greatest acclaim.
Perhaps because Harty himself seemed
to enjoy this number most, perhaps be
cause the audience was more familiar
with the other numbers, it was so well
received.

The Irish symphony, built on cer
tain themes taken from the music of
the conductor's native land, is based on
three melodies. Two of the melodies are
spirited dances in allegro time played
with an exciting tyinpani accompani
ment. The third theme is a beautiful
adagio introduced by the cellos. The
melody is a tenderly beautiful folk
song, "Emir's Farewell to Cuchullain."
Especially interesting was the finale of
the rhapsody. The third theme is being
developed vivaciously by the whole
orchestra, but it is stopped suddenly a
few bars before the end, and the open
ing notes of the first theme conclude
the piece.
Sir Harty's own arrangement of "The
Water Music" by Handel opened the
concert. This music, written by Handel
for a barge party given by George I,
consists of "gay or soothing songs and
spirited dances alternating with fan
fares from the brass secfion." Harty has
taken six of the original twenty num
