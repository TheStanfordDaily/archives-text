# HEALTH PROBLEMS—FREE BUT UNWANTED
## 
### 
Health is overemphasized and over-discussed. It is com
mercialized l<> a decree perhaps exceeding even that ol patent
medicine heydeys. In a recent Literary Digest article it is char
acterized as a "racket."
Aiming those who fall in line with popular health tallacies
of evei'v nature are a surprising num'her ot university students.
They begin the day with more or less ill-tasting vegetable
juices. Each new "health food" or "health aid is eagerly tried.
A remarkable variety of dentifrices, cosmetics, and antiseptics
is found in most bathroom medicine chests.
Men are as susceptible as women.
Although there is a degree of health in most of the prepara
tions and appliances so hopefully ottered to the public, ami al
though the health advertising lias been of high importance in
general hygienic education, it is in the main overdone. In one
instance a food advertised for a health element which it con
tained was found to have so infinitesimal a proportion of the
element as to make it negligible in health value—the advertising
was banned.
All this is largely commercial, Dr. Storey of the Student
Health Service has always maintained, and that which is com
mercial should be investigated before being adopted.
And Dr. Logan Clendening, a national writer on the subject,
in a recent Saturday Evening Post article suggests that any doc
tor at any time can find something wrong with most any one
of us.
Re "choosey" in where you go for advice, Dr. Storey re
peatedly counsels students.
There are a number of true health problems—-physical, men
tal, and social—among students; these are best taken care ot bv
immediate conferences with stall doctors in the Board ot Ath
letic Control building.
But moderation of living, with a regular and varied diet,
and not the blind following of commercial health appeals, will
dispose of more fancied illnesses than any self-cure of non
existent bogies.
The student who is truly ill, in any way perplexed about his
physical condition, has at his service the capable doctors ot the
Student Health Service. Hospital facilities, and outstanding spe
cialists in any tield of hygiene lire obtainable at call.
"What I most appreciate," Dr. Storey always advises, "is to
have students come to us immediately with their 'health prob
lems.''"
