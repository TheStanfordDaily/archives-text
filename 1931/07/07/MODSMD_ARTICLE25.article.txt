### 
Last Friday night's world heavyweight championship fight
in Cleveland Municipal Stadium may not have been a iinancial
success as far as Madison Square Garden was concerned, but it
proved one point, and proved il definitely. Willie L. Stribling
as a lighter is through ruined by ruthless commercialization.
"W.L." lias been lighting since he was twelve years old, and lias
burned himself out by training tor prize lighting as a business.
This short and extensive heavy training for the prize ring is
not the ideal form of exercise for the average man. American
colleges lately have come to realize this fact and are now train
ing their men in competitive sports habits that will induce them
to carry on light exercise after their college days are over.
Years ago the popular belief in colleges was to discipline and
train the body with dumb-bells and other hatetul mechanical
forms of exercise, and thus when the student graduated he leit
his muscles in the gymnasium.
At Stanford, the athletic program is so arranged that when
we graduate, we lake our golf, tennis, and swimming with us
out into the business world. We are not jUst training for our
undergraduate days, but for the future. I'nlikc Stribling, our
light is not for a few short rounds, but for an entire lifetime.
