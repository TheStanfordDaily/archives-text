Wo lavmen nro prone In he cynical and disdainful nl the
painfully precise verbiage ol' Hie courts and tlie lawyers. I hey
take pages of long words to say what we think could he said in
a couple of sentences. We hecome mirthiul over the jaw-break
ing polysyllables of the scientists to whom a buttercup is re
nunciilus acris or ranunculus bulbosus. We are susj)icious ol
the sociologists with their highly refined terms to identity ac
tions and impulses that we would describe in ordinary words.
Still we non-technical people will perceive that the legal lan
guage is, in fact, made at least to some decree necessary and
inevitable in order to cover every contingency and to block up
every undesirable loophole. Our language will do for conver
sation but it wouldn't insure justice. Our buttercup needs no
closer description as a flower in the field, but when we take
it into the laboratory we shall need many more common words
than the simple acris or bulbosus to serve the same purpose.
Our cvery-dav words will cover the actions of groups and crowds
suflieiently in a general way, hut when we try to distinguish
and discriminate and classify and discover laws of group and
mass action those common words won't do.

That is, technical terminology is needed for technical jobs;
the jobs make the language, and it isn't the language that makes
the science. That's what really bothers us the habit of little
people of using big words unnecessarily, putting on airs. The
littlest lawyers use the biggest words. The best scientists show
their real learning in being able to translate scientific lore into
language that you and I understand. It's when the specialist
seems to resort to his professional jargon for the purpose of
making himself hard to understand rather than to be accurate
and precise that we laymen gel sore.
