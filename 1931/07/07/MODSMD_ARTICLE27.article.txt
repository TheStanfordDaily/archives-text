With the news that Washington Uni
versity at St. Louis is inaugurating
talking moving pictures in the place of
lectures, the university of the futuiv
may take on the appearance of a glori
fied movie palace.
The announcement of courses will
probably look like the month's program
at (he local theatre with favorite pro
fessors playing the title roles in the
"(alkies."
THAT WILL BRING UP A NEW
PROBLEM FOR THE SCHOOL OF
EDUCATION. COURSES IN SEX AP
PEAL WILL BE THE FIRST INNO
VATION AND WE CAN IMAGINE
THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF AN AM
BITIOUS PROFESSOR WHO FAILS
TO PASS HIS SCREEN TEST.
Undoubtedly the most popular
courses will be in history.
The sight of the campus "heavy"
going through the torrid scenes
from Anthony and Cleopatra and
of the dean of women showing the
technique of Helen of Troy, for
instance, would keep any class
awake.
The students will be at a disadvan
tage in that they won't be able to argue
with the professor.
The first step in becoming a profes
sor will be to get a job as an "extra"
and hope that the leading man gets a
cold.
Classes in physical education
would be in a hole if the sound
track got stuck and kept repeat
ing a tough exercise for half an
hour.
If the experiment does become popu
lar we can expect to see more of our
professors at the movies these nights,
getting some pointers.
THE ULTIMATE "BREAK" FOR
TIIE STUDENT IS THAT HE CAN
GO TO SLEEP DURING A LEC
TURE AND HIS SNORING WON'T
HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE
PROFESSOR.

According to the history books the
Dutch traded Manhattan Island for a
bottle of firewater. If they had pre
served the liquor they would now be
in a position to make a very advan
tageous speculation in the same real
estate.
ABOUT THE ONLY THING A MAN
NEEDS TO BECOME POLITICAL
TIMBER IS THE ABILITY TO PLANK
DOWN.
Last month at the International Rail
way Conference held at Montreal, Sir
John Bartley of London made the
statement that English trains are tiie
fastest in Ihe world. Sir John should
try our California trains. When we
pass a field of turnips, then one of car
rots, then one of cabbage, and a large
pond of water, we are going so fast
that it looks like soup.
In the German Journal of Science it
is announced that a naturalist has
taught an ape to talk. It is too bad.
There is too much of that now.
Politics is either a matter of passing
the buck or passing Ihe doe.
We shall beat our swords into plow
shares, our corkscrews into button
hooks, and our version of the war into
the heads of our children.
A poet's chance for immortality has
no eftect whatever on reducing the
premiums on his life insurance.
Monterey sardine canners have voted
a million dollars for advertising for the
next three years, but not one cent for
larger quarters for the sardine.
IN PLACE OF RAIL SPLITTING IN
