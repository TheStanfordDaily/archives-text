KIKI—At the California Theatre, May- .
field.
A pseudo-sophisticated Mary Pick- j
ford plays a new and different role in |
this hilarious comedy. Imagine Mary |
with a French accent, frizzy hair, and
above-the-khec dresses and you have
Kiki (pronounced Keekee), the ex
tremely temperamental chorus girl
from Paris, who tries to break into
Broadway. Certainly not the old, sweet
Pickford by a long way, but mighty
entertaining, nevertheless.
Kiki gels a chance in the chorus of
a new show and falls in love with the
manage]', who doesn't give her a half
friendly smile even, because he thinks
he is in love with the leading lady. On
the opening night, Kiki gets out of step,
loses half her costume, and disrupts the
entire chorus to such an extent that a
fairly respectable musical comedy is
turned into a screaming flop. The man
ager, who, by the way, is played by
Reginald Denny in an intelligent man
ner, fires the little French girl imme
diately, and then relents a little under
her alternate pleadings and threats, and
decides to make better use of her. He
takes her to his apartment and the rest
of the picture shows how Kiki uses her
head to obtain the desire of her heart.
It's surprising how young Miss Pick
ford looks in this talkie.

THE MATRIMONAL BED—At the
Varsity Theatre.
It's ridiculous what producers and
publicity directors are doing these days
to try to make a show sound bold and
risque. They give it a name which sug
gests indiscreet scenes (for instance,
"The Matrimonial Bed"), call it a
"naughty narrative" in the program,
and then, in this case at least, delight
fully surprise by combining numerous
funny situations, a catchy plot, and
good dialogue into two hours of excel
lent entertainment —without any smut.
The plot in brief: a man who is hap
pily married, has an accident and loses
his memory completely. He marries an
other woman and his first wife marries
another man. After a period of years,
in the occupation of a barber, he is
called to his first wife's home to dress
her hair. Of course he doesn't remem
ber her, but she recognizes him . . . .
GOLD DUST GERTIE—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Not one of the famous house-cleaning
twins—but only Winnie Lightner. But
she's loud enough and funny enough
for any two people. The plot, if any,
is insignificant; and maybe it's not
necessary. The scene of operations is a
bathing suit factory and offers countless
opportunities for good lines.
Miss Lightner is supported in a
lively manner by Claude Gillingwater
as the old owner of the factory, and
Olsen and Johnson, the famous comedy
team who are at present entertaining
the theatergoers of San Francisco.

If you like slap-stick in its various
forms cind are a Lightner fan, you'll
enojy Ibis show.

his memory completely. He marries an
other woman and his first wife marries
another man. After a period of years,
in the occupation of a barber, he is
called to his first wife's home to dress
her hair. Of course he doesn't remem
ber her, but she recognizes him . . . .
GOLD DUST GERTIE—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Not one of the famous house-cleaning
twins—but only Winnie Lightner. But
she's loud enough and funny enough
for any two people. The plot, if any,
is insignificant; and maybe it's not
necessary. The scene of operations is a
bathing suit factory and offers countless
opportunities for good lines.
Miss Lightner is supported in a
lively manner by Claude Gillingwater
as the old owner of the factory, and
Olsen and Johnson, the famous comedy
team who are at present entertaining
the theatergoers of San Francisco.

If you like slap-stick in its various
forms cind are a Lightner fan, you'll
enojy Ibis show.
KIKI—At the California Theatre, May- .
field.
A pseudo-sophisticated Mary Pick- j
ford plays a new and different role in |
this hilarious comedy. Imagine Mary |
with a French accent, frizzy hair, and
above-the-khec dresses and you have
Kiki (pronounced Keekee), the ex
tremely temperamental chorus girl
from Paris, who tries to break into
Broadway. Certainly not the old, sweet
Pickford by a long way, but mighty
entertaining, nevertheless.
Kiki gels a chance in the chorus of
a new show and falls in love with the
manage]', who doesn't give her a half
friendly smile even, because he thinks
he is in love with the leading lady. On
the opening night, Kiki gets out of step,
loses half her costume, and disrupts the
entire chorus to such an extent that a
fairly respectable musical comedy is
turned into a screaming flop. The man
ager, who, by the way, is played by
Reginald Denny in an intelligent man
ner, fires the little French girl imme
diately, and then relents a little under
her alternate pleadings and threats, and
decides to make better use of her. He
takes her to his apartment and the rest
of the picture shows how Kiki uses her
head to obtain the desire of her heart.
It's surprising how young Miss Pick
ford looks in this talkie.

THE MATRIMONAL BED—At the
Varsity Theatre.
It's ridiculous what producers and
publicity directors are doing these days
to try to make a show sound bold and
risque. They give it a name which sug
gests indiscreet scenes (for instance,
"The Matrimonial Bed"), call it a
"naughty narrative" in the program,
and then, in this case at least, delight
fully surprise by combining numerous
funny situations, a catchy plot, and
good dialogue into two hours of excel
lent entertainment —without any smut.
The plot in brief: a man who is hap
pily married, has an accident and loses
his memory completely. He marries an
other woman and his first wife marries
another man. After a period of years,
in the occupation of a barber, he is
called to his first wife's home to dress
her hair. Of course he doesn't remem
