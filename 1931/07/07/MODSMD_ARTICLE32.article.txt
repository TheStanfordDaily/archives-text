"WORLD CHAMPIONS"—By Paul Mo
rand. (Translated by Ilamish Miles.)
llarcourt, Brace and Company, New
York. 1931. (At the Palo Alio Book
Shop.)
"Born in the four corners of the
United States, on four different levels
of society, sprung from ancestors com
ing from the ends of the earth," four
Columbia students, each a successful
college leader, form a secret society,
and call themselves the "Champions.'
Pledging themselves to meet again in
ten years, when summoned by llu 1
word "Remember," each sets out to be
come "the best man in his particular
line, the master of his special busi
ness."
"In twenty years," predicted one of
them, Columbia's best orator, "The
'Champions' are going to be masters i<f
America."
Morand knows America amazingly
well, from personal observation, and
keen interest and understanding. He
has created here four types, neither too
common nor too unrecognizable, and
he follows them through their next
twenty years? himself playing the role
of confidant and friend. He knows, and
tells in this latest novel of his, how
each succeeds and wherein each fails,
as indeed each must.

The book is carelessly and sketchily
written, containing now and again pas
sages that are suspiciously like those
from the pen of a master stylist, and
others that are worth only passing by.
It is as good a book as one has a right
to expect from a man who wanted to
be a diplomat, but, realizing that he
would never be a good one, accident
ally became a novelist. His books are
strangely like accidents, as a result,
though his sharp observations of
American life and people are worth
while enough.
