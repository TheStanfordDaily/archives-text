# SUMMER TENNIS TITLE SOUGHT BY 44 MEN SAYS COACH BUGGE
## Eight Players in Seeded List; Doubles Tournament In Near Future 
### 
Willi 44 men participating, the Sum
mer Quarter singles tennis tournament
gets under way today. This is eon-

sidered a large turnout for a summer
tourney, says Coach Elwyn B. Bugge,
sponsor for the competition.

Eight men have been seeded. Bugge
states, however, that the seeded list is
made up of players with whose ability
lie is familiar. He feels that there are
perhaps just as good tennis players in
the tournament but with unknown
ability. The list of seeded men is as
follows: 1. Jack Pike, 2. William John-

ston, 3. M. Onishi, 4. A. H. Burnett,
5. V. E. Brodbent, G. P. H. Engelcke,
7. Ed Burns, and 8. Dick Webb.

Members of both the upper and
lower bracket are requested to com
municate with their opponents and ar
range a playing time suitable to both.
Bugffe says the players are mainly on

their own initiative and must arrange
their matches to suit themselves. The
bracket schedule is posted in the Men's
Gym with the first-round opponents
and their University address. There are
twelve first-round matches and they
must be concluded by July 17. The time
limit for the second rung is one week
later.
If any difficulty arises regarding
time or playing courts the contestants
are to see Bugge at once. The only re
strictions being that the varsity courts
are reserved during class periods from
2 to 4 o'clock on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, and that varsity tennis let
termen are barred.

Bugge states that a doubles tourna
ment will probably be held in the near
future. To date no trophy has been se
cured for a doubles competition but
Bugge hopes to obtain one.
