known then, as now, as the ''Directory
of Students," was a seven-page book
let, containing the names and rddresses
of 475 students, but not owning its
, present familiar title, since it did not
, publish grades.
Stanford's first time schedule, given
1 to the 475 students who registered in
j 1891, contained the information that
I classes began on the half-hour, that
| chapel was at 8:15 every morning, and
| that there were 92 courses from which
! to choose. In 1930 over 3,500 students
i registered each quarter, and chose their
: courses from a list of over GOO.
Unlike the present fourteen-page
! booklet, the "Leland Stanford Junior
| University Schedule of Lectures and
, Recitations and Director, first semester,
; 1891," consisted of one page about the
size of notebook paper; the one for
i the second semester of that year was
! a few inches larger, and the next year
| the schedule was quite a large sheet,
! folded several times like a road map.
t The first one with several pages bound
i together came out in 1905. In 1899 the
j words "Price ten cents" made their
first appearance, and are still to be
I found on the schedules.
As do the modern ones, this list of
j courses had a calendar for the academic
| year on it, showing that there were
two semesters, the second one starting

] in January.
The first classes began at 8:30 in the
morning, after chapel, which was held
at 8:15. Students of 1931 who complain
lof hunger during their 11 o'clock
i classes will sympathize with the first
Farm inhabitants whose last morning
classes began at 11:30 and lasted until
12:30.
The 92 courses offered were given by
24 professors. In all departments ox
; cept those of English, mathematics,
j zoology, and mechanical engineering,
, all courses were given by one profes
sor. Courses in physical education were
I not listed, although instructors in that
l department were part of the group of
31 faculty members. There was no
mention of syllabus fees. The time
I schedule for autumn, 1932, lists 7G
i courses in physical education.

known then, as now, as the ''Directory
