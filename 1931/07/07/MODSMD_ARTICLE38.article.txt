# COLLEGES TRAIN TOO MANY STUDENTS SAYS DR. F. K. RICHTMYER
## 
### 
! Colleges are training too many grad
j uates in the field of science in the
j professor of physics and Dean of the
j Graduate School of Cornell University.
1 When interviewed by a Daily reporter
j yesterday he said, '"A university spends
| approximately $10,000 on a student who

'is given two graduate years and in
I many cases this expenditure is not jus-
J tified in lieu of the funds available for
I graduate work."

Dr. Richtmyer believes that human -
! ity would be more greatly benefited if
! a few select students were given better
j equipment to work with. He admits
; that picking the correct students with
; accuracy in every case is impossible,
I but points to Princeton with a limit of
; 200 graduate students, noted for its suc
cess in graduate work.

"Limitations in the number of gradu
ate students will naturally come about
by informal selection, I believe," Richt
myer stated. "Wiih figures showing that
America created approximately 1,000
Ph.D.'s in 1928 and 1.400 in 1929. it is
apparent that the 'saturation point' will
soon be reached in this field."
Fellowships administered by the Na
| tional Research Council since the
! World War have had more influence
!on American science than any other
! one factor, Dr. Richtmyer declared. A
; great number of scientific theorists
i have appeared as a result of this work,
in which he is engaged as Chairman of
| the Division of Physical Scientists.
The American tendency to place a
1 utilitarian evaluation on all college
1 work was decried. "In an age of science
consciousness, America is inclined to
; demand 'practical' results from every
' research scientist, never realizing the
aesthetic value of the work," the Cor
nell Dean concluded. "The trend in
| education should not be toward the
practical, but toward the aesthetic,
I which is the aim in education."

Dr. Richtmyer is a visiting professor
of Stanford this summer.
