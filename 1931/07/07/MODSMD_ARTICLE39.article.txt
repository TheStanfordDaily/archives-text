# 'AUTHORITY' IS SUBJECT OF SUNDAY SERMON
## 
### 
The Reverend Albert W. Palmer,
j D.D., of the Chicago Theological Sem
' inary, speaking in the Memorial Church
Sunday morning, took his text from
the seventh chapter of the Gosped ac
! cording to Matthew: "For he talked to
them as one having authority and not
; as their scribes."

li We live," said Dr. Palmer, "in the
age of the great god Authority. We ask
of everything, 'On what authority?' The
authorities which have passed away
are external. Those that abide are of
the inner spirit. Three of these surviv
ing authorities are Truth, Beauty, and
Goodness. These were the authorities
with which Jesus spoke. Most of all,
Jesus spoke with the authority of
Goodness.

"Regarding the authority of Truth in
religion today, that which is true is
orthodox, since such old authorities as
the Bible no longer hold. In the l'ealm
of Beauty the church has an art pos
sessed by no one else, the art of wor
ship. As for Goodness, the world has
always listened to the authority of
goodness," concluded Dr. Palmer.
