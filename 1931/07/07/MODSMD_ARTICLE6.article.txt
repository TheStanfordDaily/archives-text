# MERCURY SOARS TO 110 DEGREES
## Breaks Record of 26 Years' Standing 
### 
Breaking the previous heat record in
| existence for 26 years and setting a new
j high mark on the campus and in Palo
| Alto, the mercury soared to 110 degrees
on Friday afternoon, according to read
ings made at the home of the late John
A. Squire, for many years official
weather bureau observer in Palo Alto,
and the new city thermometer located
in the City Park. The former record,
| broken by last week's state-wide heat
j wave, was set July 7, 1905, when a tem
j erature of 107 degrees was registered.
According to subsequent reading high
i marks for Saturday, Sunday, and yes
terday were recorded at 105, 88, and 82
- respectively. An unofficial reading of a
thermometer placed in the sun on Fri
day tabulated 120 degrees at which
reading the mercury showed signs of
breaking through the top of the tube,
observers declared.
Reports from the Union Cellar and
; Palo Alto confectionary stores disclosed
| that students spent most of their time
J during the heat wave in quenching
I thirts and wetting parched throats. Un
official reports had other students quaf
fing home brew and patroniiing near
| by beer parlors.
Comptroller's office figures failed to
! show any dangerous effects to the
the low campus water supply as a re
sult of the heat wave.
