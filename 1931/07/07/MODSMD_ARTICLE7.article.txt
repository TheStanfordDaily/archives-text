## 
### 
Carmel and Montei'ey, historically
important California towns, will be the
destination of the excursion on Satur
day. Cars will leave from the front en
trance of the Union at 8 o'clock on
Saturday morning and will return late
in the afternoon. Fare will be $5.00, and
lunches may be purchased in Mon
terey.
Monterey, the town where Robert
Louis Stevenson lived for a time and
in which he was inspired to write
"Treasure Island," was at one time the
social and political center of California.
It still contains many relics of its for
mer glory. One of the four California
presidios is located there; the other
three are at San Francisco, Santa Bar
bara, and San Diego.
The scenic 17-Mile-Drive at Monte
rey will be included in the trip if the
passengers wish to take the time for it.
The excursionists will also have the
privilege of deciding for or against re
turning to Stanford by way of Santa
Cruz.
Three miles from Monterey is Car
mel, where the Carmel mission is one
of the points of interest. Father Sena,
founder of the Franciscan missions in
California, is buried in front of the
altar in the mission, and the spot where
he died is marked. Below the mission
flows the Carmel river, where the first
boat made by a white man in Cali
fornia appeared when Captain Ayala
made a craft in 1775.
