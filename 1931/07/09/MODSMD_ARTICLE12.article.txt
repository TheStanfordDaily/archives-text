# "Inspector General" To Be Given Friday
## Gogol's Master Comedy Is Characterization of Russia a Century Ago; Ridicules Petty Officials 
### BY STAFF REVIEWER 
BY STAFF REVIEWER

117ITII "The Inscctor General" ready now for an audience after the first dress
rehearsal, Harold Helvenston, director, will attempt to perfect his charac
terizations of petty officials in Russia a century ago to make of the play the
show it promises to be. Nikolai Gogol created characters which were best 1
portrayed, with a few exceptions, by caricature.
Each official whose misdeeds in office are ridiculed by the author, is made a j
definite and original character, with no two even approaching each other in |
similarity. Original action and characterization has been read into the play in

this production, which material does not
appear in the play, either as written,
or as revised by John Anderson. '
The first act will reveal the organiza
tion of political rogues who are friends
and accomplices in their misuse of their
offices. Withal, they are intensely hu
man, though unmistakably farce char
acters.
Difficult roles have been given the
actors 4o portray. David Dickey has
the part of the Mayor, arch rascal of
his town, and a coward in the final
analysis. He poses as a righteous man,
though his confreres in the scandalous
government of the town know his
hypocritic nature.
Luka Lukitch, school superintendent
and weak reprobate who babbles help
lessly at times, is being given an in
teresting interpretation by Walter
Hempstead, Jr.
A Circlc of Rogues
Another character who holds the
center o fthe stage during the intrigue
is George V. Casler, as Lyapkin Tyap
kin, the Judge, who is ready to con
demn his fellows to defend the filth of
his court, and who spends his days
raising puppies given him as bribes.
Henry Kleinbach and Harry .Lee
Logan, as Hospital Commissioner and
Postmaster, respectively, complete the
circle of rogues, who fear the visit of
the inspector-general. Boyd Homewood
and Cary Odell make up a comedy
team which bids fair to carry the show
in spots. They are two landowners, who
emphasize their own importance and
poke excited and inefficient noses into
everything, and manage to be extreme
ly funny in so doing. They are not the
comedy element, as comedy elements
are sometimes injected into plays, but
are only somewhat more farcical than
the rest of the characters.
Lucile Morgan, as Marya, the pretty
daughter of her wicked father, the
Mayor, has the task of interpreting in
a way of her own a part played by
Dorothy Gish in New York. It is no
character part, but a straight juvenile
lead which must be made fascinating.
Katherine Musante has the colorful
role of a mother who looks much too
young to be the mother of a grown
daughter, and proves to have a fascina
tion for the youthful and dapper Hles
takov.
An Unusually Large Cast
There is an unusually large cast,
composed of a number of townspeople
and servants and minor officials, all of
whom have been carefully trained to
carry out their part of the comedy, and
to play up to the major characteriza
tions, which is never a small task .tor
any actor.
Gogol has written a master-comedy.
The coming production is being pre
pared with attention to the author's
creatiton of character and his objects
of satire, and is being played primar
ily for a good comcdy and has the
makings of a "good show.''
Tickets are still to be obtained at the
office of the Associated Students at the
Old Union, and at Keebles in Palo Alto.

portrayed, with a few exceptions, by caricature.
Each official whose misdeeds in office are ridiculed by the author, is made a j
definite and original character, with no two even approaching each other in |
similarity. Original action and characterization has been read into the play in

this production, which material does not
appear in the play, either as written,
or as revised by John Anderson. '
The first act will reveal the organiza
tion of political rogues who are friends
and accomplices in their misuse of their
offices. Withal, they are intensely hu
man, though unmistakably farce char
acters.
Difficult roles have been given the
actors 4o portray. David Dickey has
the part of the Mayor, arch rascal of
his town, and a coward in the final
analysis. He poses as a righteous man,
though his confreres in the scandalous
government of the town know his
hypocritic nature.
Luka Lukitch, school superintendent
and weak reprobate who babbles help
lessly at times, is being given an in
teresting interpretation by Walter
Hempstead, Jr.
A Circlc of Rogues
Another character who holds the
center o fthe stage during the intrigue
is George V. Casler, as Lyapkin Tyap
kin, the Judge, who is ready to con
demn his fellows to defend the filth of
his court, and who spends his days
raising puppies given him as bribes.
Henry Kleinbach and Harry .Lee
Logan, as Hospital Commissioner and
Postmaster, respectively, complete the
circle of rogues, who fear the visit of
the inspector-general. Boyd Homewood
and Cary Odell make up a comedy
team which bids fair to carry the show
in spots. They are two landowners, who
emphasize their own importance and
poke excited and inefficient noses into
everything, and manage to be extreme
ly funny in so doing. They are not the
comedy element, as comedy elements
are sometimes injected into plays, but
are only somewhat more farcical than
the rest of the characters.
Lucile Morgan, as Marya, the pretty
daughter of her wicked father, the
Mayor, has the task of interpreting in
a way of her own a part played by
Dorothy Gish in New York. It is no
character part, but a straight juvenile
lead which must be made fascinating.
Katherine Musante has the colorful
role of a mother who looks much too
young to be the mother of a grown
daughter, and proves to have a fascina
tion for the youthful and dapper Hles
takov.
An Unusually Large Cast
There is an unusually large cast,
composed of a number of townspeople
and servants and minor officials, all of
whom have been carefully trained to
carry out their part of the comedy, and
to play up to the major characteriza
tions, which is never a small task .tor
any actor.
Gogol has written a master-comedy.
The coming production is being pre
pared with attention to the author's
creatiton of character and his objects
of satire, and is being played primar
ily for a good comcdy and has the
makings of a "good show.''
Tickets are still to be obtained at the
office of the Associated Students at the
Old Union, and at Keebles in Palo Alto.
