I curried flanks of a desert-battered j

touring car from Utah, while a New
York sedan and a Colorado coupe wise
cracked about the oil dripping from
the New Hampshirite's crank case.
A few yards away in the shade of a
cluster of trees three Oregon motors
were lined up in military precision
with a sleekly fat New Jersey model
leading the parade. Behind this glisten
ing array a travel-stained North Da
kotan acted as rear guard.
In other places strange cars, bearing
Montana or Washington licenses, were j
found intermingled with those carry
ing Nevada or California plates. Wyo- ;
ming, Nebraska, lowa, Texas, and New
