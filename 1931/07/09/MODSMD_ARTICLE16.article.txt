# Von Hentig Tells Of Changes In Germany
## Population Problem Serious Says German Consul 
### 
"The greatest problem facing the
German people today is the population
problem," declared Dr. W. O. von Hen
tig, German consul general at San
Francisco, in his lecture Tuesday night
in the Little Theatre, given to the mo
tion picture travelogue, "Beautiful
Germany."
"In the rural sections of Germa-ny,"
von Hentig said, "there are 20 peopie
to one square kilometer, and in the
most thickly populated sections there
.are 440, making an average for the
whole country of 134 people squa-ie
kilometer. Other European states have
dense populations also, but they have
colonies providing room for expansion,
while as a result of the Versailles Peace
Treaty Germany has no such possibili
ties."
The consul general continued by say
ing that the people of Germany have
changed more during the last ten years,
if we consider the effects of the war
upon German minds, than they have
during any previous period. Social tra
ditions that endured for years have
been broken, and class distinctions
have nearly disappeared.
In concluding, von Hentig urged that
Americans who travel in Germany visit
the eastern sections, because here are
the most typical people and the most
interesting scenery.
The travelogue first showed scenes
of the Hamburg section, then moved
eastward along the Baltic Sea to East
Prussia, the Kentucky of Germany, into
Silesia and back to Berlin. From there
the film showed Saxony and gave views
of the Harz mountains and Thuringia,
the home of Martin Luther. Journeying
into Bavaria, it offered views of the
Alps and Lake Constance, and con
cluded with the Rhine industrial dis
trict, especially the cities of Cologne
and Frankfort.
