# WILBUR MAKES PLEAS FOR LESS CENTRALIZATION
## Large Audience Welcomes President In Assembly Yesterday Numerous Duties Of Interior Department Outlined In Address 
### 
"The more one sees of the l'est of
the world, the more one can be con
tented here," said Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, president of the University, now
on leave and serving as Secretary of
the Interior, in his acknowledgment of
the greeting of students and faculty at
the assembly yesterday.
As a member of the national adminis
! tration he made an earnest plea against
I the tendency to take problems of all
i sorts to Washington instead of main
j taining local self-reliance in govern
j ment. As an example of the manifold
responsibilities and activities of the
national government he sketched the
variety of the Interior Department
j work that he encountered on his trip

| and a number of other enterprises.
"There is going on in this country, a
j movement for greater centralization in
j federal government, a movement which
| is a menace to true self-government,"
Wilbur declared. "The tendency today
is to bring to Washington problems
which should be settled locally.'" This,
j he explained, means a great increase in
i the responsibilities of the central gov
ernment, responsibilities which devolve
! on the President.
Local Responsibility Needed
"The only way I see to relieve the
j situation is a development of more and
! more local responsibility," Wilbur con
tinued. /
"Moreover, the rapidity with which
economic change has taken place is
confusing old economic thinking. It is
| significant that the central government
should be well organized and that the
people should sense the international
responsibility that we have. We arc
confronted with world leadership in
finance and other fields, without the
proper seasoning for it. We do not have
the training the French and the British
have. We must face it, however, and
we need the help of all the educated
i and university groups in the country."
Dr. Wilbur illustrated this centraliza
tion of responsibility by reviewing the
scope of the Department of the In
! terior. On his way to California Dr.
Wilbur stopped at several educational
institutions and gave commencement
addresses at two of them. The Depart
