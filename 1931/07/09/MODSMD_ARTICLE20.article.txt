# WILBUR MAKES PLEAS FOR LESS CENTRALIZATION
## Large Audience Welcomes President In Assembly Yesterday Numerous Duties Of Interior Department Outlined In Address 
### 
"The more one sees of the l'est of
the world, the more one can be con
tented here," said Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, president of the University, now
on leave and serving as Secretary of
the Interior, in his acknowledgment of
the greeting of students and faculty at
the assembly yesterday.
As a member of the national adminis
! tration he made an earnest plea against
I the tendency to take problems of all
i sorts to Washington instead of main
j taining local self-reliance in govern
j ment. As an example of the manifold
responsibilities and activities of the
national government he sketched the
variety of the Interior Department
j work that he encountered on his trip
j westward 'from Washington to Stan
ford. These dealt with education, irri
j gation, national parks, Indian affairs,
| and a number of other enterprises.
"There is going on in this country, a
j movement for greater centralization in
j federal government, a movement which
| is a menace to true self-government,"
Wilbur declared. "The tendency today
is to bring to Washington problems
which should be settled locally.'" This,
j he explained, means a great increase in
i the responsibilities of the central gov
ernment, responsibilities which devolve
! on the President.
Local Responsibility Needed
"The only way I see to relieve the
j situation is a development of more and
! more local responsibility," Wilbur con
tinued. /
"Moreover, the rapidity with which
economic change has taken place is
confusing old economic thinking. It is
| significant that the central government
should be well organized and that the
people should sense the international
responsibility that we have. We arc
confronted with world leadership in
finance and other fields, without the
proper seasoning for it. We do not have
the training the French and the British
have. We must face it, however, and
we need the help of all the educated
i and university groups in the country."
Dr. Wilbur illustrated this centraliza
tion of responsibility by reviewing the
scope of the Department of the In
! terior. On his way to California Dr.
Wilbur stopped at several educational
institutions and gave commencement
addresses at two of them. The Depart
merit of the Interior, he pointed out,
has to see what can be done with rdu
; cation in this country. The Department
•j has a desire to meet the abuses and
, inadequacies that are. not met locally.
| Dr. Wilbur said these things cannot be
; solved by money alone; the people have
to solve them, and they have to want
to solve them. "Our safety as a nation
depends on our system of education
and the attention we give to it."
Urges National Viewpoint
In speaking of the conquest of the
desert, Dr. Wilbur stated that the basis
of success in the control of water and
the desert is peace. War and irrigation
cannot go together, and combat can de
stroy a people whose life depends on
miles of canals of water.
In concluding, Secretary Wilbur ap
pealed to the audience as citizens and
asked them not to unload local prob
lems on the state, and state problems
on the national government.
"Our great difficulty is to get a na
tional point of view. Do the local job
well, don't expect too much of the fed-
I eral government, and have confidence
in what is being done. The men in the
j departments are sincere and earnest
j and are doing the best they can. Add
to the number who can think in great
national terms and in great world
| terms upon our national problems."
Acting President Robert E. Swain
introduced Dr. Wilbur.
"We are proud of his achievements,
j and glad to welcome him home again."

of success in the control of water and
the desert is peace. War and irrigation
cannot go together, and combat can de
stroy a people whose life depends on
miles of canals of water.
In concluding, Secretary Wilbur ap
pealed to the audience as citizens and
asked them not to unload local prob
lems on the state, and state problems
on the national government.
"Our great difficulty is to get a na
tional point of view. Do the local job
well, don't expect too much of the fed-
I eral government, and have confidence
in what is being done. The men in the
j departments are sincere and earnest
j and are doing the best they can. Add
to the number who can think in great
national terms and in great world
| terms upon our national problems."
Acting President Robert E. Swain
introduced Dr. Wilbur.
"We are proud of his achievements,
j and glad to welcome him home again."
"The more one sees of the l'est of
the world, the more one can be con
tented here," said Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, president of the University, now
on leave and serving as Secretary of
the Interior, in his acknowledgment of
the greeting of students and faculty at
the assembly yesterday.
As a member of the national adminis
! tration he made an earnest plea against
I the tendency to take problems of all
i sorts to Washington instead of main
j taining local self-reliance in govern
j ment. As an example of the manifold
responsibilities and activities of the
national government he sketched the
variety of the Interior Department
j work that he encountered on his trip
j westward 'from Washington to Stan
ford. These dealt with education, irri
j gation, national parks, Indian affairs,
| and a number of other enterprises.
"There is going on in this country, a
j movement for greater centralization in
j federal government, a movement which
| is a menace to true self-government,"
Wilbur declared. "The tendency today
is to bring to Washington problems
which should be settled locally.'" This,
j he explained, means a great increase in
i the responsibilities of the central gov
ernment, responsibilities which devolve
! on the President.
Local Responsibility Needed
"The only way I see to relieve the
j situation is a development of more and
! more local responsibility," Wilbur con
tinued. /
"Moreover, the rapidity with which
economic change has taken place is
confusing old economic thinking. It is
| significant that the central government
should be well organized and that the
people should sense the international
responsibility that we have. We arc
confronted with world leadership in
finance and other fields, without the
proper seasoning for it. We do not have
the training the French and the British
have. We must face it, however, and
we need the help of all the educated
i and university groups in the country."
Dr. Wilbur illustrated this centraliza
tion of responsibility by reviewing the
scope of the Department of the In
! terior. On his way to California Dr.
Wilbur stopped at several educational
institutions and gave commencement
addresses at two of them. The Depart
merit of the Interior, he pointed out,
has to see what can be done with rdu
; cation in this country. The Department
•j has a desire to meet the abuses and
, inadequacies that are. not met locally.
| Dr. Wilbur said these things cannot be
; solved by money alone; the people have
to solve them, and they have to want
to solve them. "Our safety as a nation
depends on our system of education
and the attention we give to it."
