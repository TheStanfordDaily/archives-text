# FEDERAL OH STATE CONTROL?
## 
### 
Undoubtedly many of those who heard Dr. Wilbur in his
address yesterday were in sympathy with his plea against the
federal government controlling those affairs that might well he
left in the hands of the states and local communities. Commis
sioner of Education Cooper, addressing an audience in the
Little Theatre Tuesday, warned against the same tendency.
Especially signilicant to the school men on the campus must
be the implication made by both speakers that education should
be left in the hands of the states. This runs counter to the belie!
held by many educators that there should be a strong federal
department of education in Washington, with its head a cabinet
member. Such a policy has been advocated by the National
Education Association for many years. Publicity to the idea lias
also been spread abroad through the medium of Hearst papers.
The unfavorable attitude the Hoover administration has
taken to the proposal is undoubtedly for the reasons expressed
by Dr.. Wilbur and Dr. Cooper. With the general principle there
will be found little disagreement among thoughtful educators.
Many of them, however, are eager for the creation of a national
department with a cabinet member at its head, to supervise and
direct national efforts for education and possibly for other allied
enterprises. Whether elevating the Otlice of Education to a de
partment with a cabinet member would be a step toward
federal control or whether it would merely enable the oltice to
be of more assistance in the work that it now is doing is a
moot point.
