# THE
						PLAGUE OF ANTS
## 
### 
In another column of this paper there is recorded the story
of one student's terrific battle against the inroads ot certain
ants. Now that the veil of silence which lias covered lliis subject
has been torn, a word or two more may as well be added.
Although from the standpoint of the importance these in
sects assume in one's daily routine, there should be a vast
literature on the subject, little or nothing is ever said about
them. The stranger to these parts knows nothing about them
until he sees one of them disappearing under the cuft ot bis
shirt or a horde of them defiling across a book or an orange lie
lias laid down somewhere. From that moment on, if the new
comer is squeamish, bis life will be one long torment. Ihe
only alternative is to develop a philosophical resignation.
An historical approach to the problem would be proper, no
doubt, in this environment. The only difficulty is that even it
we did discover just where these ants came from and when, we
wouldn't be able to do anything about getting rid ot them.
Recalling the plague of locusts that one time descended upon
the land of the Pharaohs, and* the reason for that plague, we
might infer that the pestilence lias been brought upon us as the
result of the importunate prayers of a righteous Cal alumnus.
You recall the score of that football game last tall?
Well, whatever the cause, the problem is what to do about
these insects. So far the most helpful suggestion that lias issued
from those who have given thought to the problem is this:
Burn down all the buildings in the .community, coat everyone
with ant poison, and abandon the land to the ants.
