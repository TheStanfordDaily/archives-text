# NO SMOKING ON THE QUAD
## 
### 
A tradition founded upon a request of Mrs. Leland Stanford
decrees tliat there he no smoking on the Quadrangle.
Now that many new students and other strangers are on the
campus, it is observed that they in numerous instances unwit
tingly smoke within the Quad. "Cabbages" refers to them as
"Freshmen in their ignorance trying to look like roughs."
Hut it is of higher significance than that.
As a courtesy to the memory of Mrs. Stanford, and as an ad
herence to Stanford traditions, the Daii.y calls the attention of
new students to this custom, and suggests that other students
inform the unknowing of itâ€”a bit of graciousness that surely
will be more welcome than offensive.
