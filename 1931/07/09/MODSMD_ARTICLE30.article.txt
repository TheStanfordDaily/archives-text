# TOADS TO RACE IN NOVEL SPORT EVENT
## 
### 
Horned toad racing will make its
debut in Palo Alto sporting circles on
the evening of July 24 under the spon
sorship of the American Legion, Palo j
Alto Post No. 375.
A horde of these horny lizards will
take off at a given signal for the outer
rim of a huge circle. Although derby j
promoters always hope their contest- J
ants will try for non-stop records, they |
say the horned toad is so tempera- I
mental about his racing that the out- ,
come is very uncertain.
If the toad feels like running, he '
runs. If not, he simply sits and blinks. j
A brilliant get-away often ends in
disaster when the spiny racer loses
his bearings and reverses his course.
Regardless of the outcome, derby i
promoters point out that any horned
toad race presents a funny spectacle, j
The course for Palo Alto's reptilian
contest will be held in the Masonic
Hall. f
On occasion of the thirty-eighth
wedding anniversary of King George
and Queen Mary the palace servants
toasted Their Majesties with cham
pagne.
