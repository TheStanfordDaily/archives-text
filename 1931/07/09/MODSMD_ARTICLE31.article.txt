interest to the progress of education.
Wilh the aid of Secretary Wilbur, an
assistant commissioner was provided
for, and that commissioner now does
much of the administrative work once

Three Major Surveys Made
Dr. Cooper stated that the work of
his department is divided up into sev
eral divisions. The assistant commis

administration, research and investiga
tion, editorial work, library work, and
occasional school surveys. The commis
sioner is left free to attend to what are
known as major surveys.
These major surveys, which extend
over three years, are now three in
number: secondary education, the edu
cation and preparation of teachers, and
school finance. The purpose of ihese
surveys, Dr. Cooper explained, is to
obtain valuable information and dis
seminate it. "No national legislation is
expected or even planned, 'as a result
of these surveys," the speaker con
tinued. "Our plan will be to go into
certain areas of the country where the
facts obtained indicate that legislation
is needed, and, working through a local
college or university, try to influence
state legislation."
Opportunity for Research Given
This work will not only be beneficial
to the progress of education generally,
it was pointed out, but it will give an
opportunity for education students to
do research work. The commissioner
appoints experts in the field of the sur
vey which is being undertaken and
those experts will select other men to
assist them, and these assistants, in turn,
will select younger men interested in
the study of education to help them.
"There is a need for some field where
men with doctor's degrees in education
can be used," Dr. Cooper concluded.
"This work that the Office of Educa
tion has undertaken will provide such
a field."

occupied largely, he said, with problems
of administration, little time being
available for matters that would be of
interest to the progress of education.
Wilh the aid of Secretary Wilbur, an
assistant commissioner was provided
for, and that commissioner now does
much of the administrative work once
left to the head of the office.
Three Major Surveys Made
Dr. Cooper stated that the work of
his department is divided up into sev
eral divisions. The assistant commis
sioned now attends to such matters as
administration, research and investiga
tion, editorial work, library work, and
occasional school surveys. The commis
sioner is left free to attend to what are
known as major surveys.
These major surveys, which extend
over three years, are now three in
number: secondary education, the edu
cation and preparation of teachers, and
school finance. The purpose of ihese
surveys, Dr. Cooper explained, is to
obtain valuable information and dis
seminate it. "No national legislation is
expected or even planned, 'as a result
of these surveys," the speaker con
tinued. "Our plan will be to go into
certain areas of the country where the
facts obtained indicate that legislation
is needed, and, working through a local
college or university, try to influence
state legislation."
Opportunity for Research Given
This work will not only be beneficial
to the progress of education generally,
it was pointed out, but it will give an
opportunity for education students to
do research work. The commissioner
appoints experts in the field of the sur
vey which is being undertaken and
those experts will select other men to
assist them, and these assistants, in turn,
will select younger men interested in
the study of education to help them.
"There is a need for some field where
men with doctor's degrees in education
can be used," Dr. Cooper concluded.
"This work that the Office of Educa
tion has undertaken will provide such
a field."
The plans of the United States Office
of Education to help the cause of edu
cation by preserving state and local
autonomy in school matters was out
lined by Dr. William J. Cooper, United
Slates Commissioner of Education, in
an address given in the Little Theatre

tight men who have held the office of

Cooper explained the organization of the

of administration, little time being

interest to the progress of education.
