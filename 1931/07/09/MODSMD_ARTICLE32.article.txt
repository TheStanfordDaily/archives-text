# ANTS PLUNDER CAKES
## Clagett Scores Kayo in 3rd BAFFLED BY BASKETS 
### 
Fred Clagctt, inmate of Toyon, has
discovered that when man and the ant
match wits there is little to choose in
favor of homo sapiens. Fred came into
possession of a supply of peaches, apri
cots, figs, and home-made nut cake.
Noting the neighborly presence of the
little black hunters, he took precau
tions with his treasure, suspending it
from a cord tied between the door
knob and the washbowl spout.
Satisfied with his work, Clagett went
to bed,. and upon awakening next
morning sleepily reached for a break
fast appetizer. He could not compre
hend the sudden change in the flavor
of apricots until an investigation un
covered the ants —ants to the right,
ants to the left, ants on top, ants un
derneath!
After washing each piece of fruit,
the collection was suspended from the
chandelier in a closed container. Within
three hours advance scouts had spotted
the cache and another hour was suffi
cient to present a solid line of ants
from floor to ceiling and from ceiling
to fruit. And the walls of Toyon are
ten feet high! Round one for the ants.
But Clagett conscripted the services
of two tin wastebaskets and filled them
partially with water. Next he secured
a couple of jars and placed them in
the exact middles of the baskets. Then
on the jars he delicately balanced his
bags of fruits and cake. Latest reports
give man the victory. Saved by a moat!
