## 
### 
When "Pop" Harris, who has owned
the bootblack stand between Salva
tierra street an dthe Bookstore for 12
years, next sees his place of work, he
will find it cleaner than formerly and
devoid of the last relics of "hazing'
which once clung to its walls. For
"•Pop'' has been ill for several months,
and changes have been made during
his absence.
Not only has Ollie Barbara, who is
taking "Pop's" place, cleaned and
painted the inside of the shoe-shining
establishment, but he has cleaned the
outside of the little house, once a wait
ing station for patrons of the "dinky"
which used to wend its way to Palo
Alto and back many times a day.
Barbara, in cleaning the station, has

removed the unsightly though pictur
esque tatters of the posters placed there
by the sophomores, who chose this
means of warning the incoming fresh
men of the various means of torture
certain to come upon them. The only
remaining decorations on the walls are
the statement, "Reward of five dollars
will be paid for information leading to
the arrest of any person who defaces
this building—Peninsular Railway C0.,"
and a few pencilled i*emarks, including
the signatures of "John and Sadie of
Chicago."
According to those who know his
plans, "Pop" Harris intends to visit the
rejuvenated building as soon as he is
able to come to thte campus, and will
take up his work there some day soon.
