rural education and extension director
of the Michigan State Normal School

Luncheon Club, Wednesday.
After a brief survey of the size and
lesources of Michigan, Dr. Smith
pointed out some of the state s educa

come under the heading of rural edu
cation. It was shown that while the
southern part of the state is very
wealthy and has excellent school sys

poorer. The problem of equalizing edu
cational opportunities by taxation is the
major difficulty before educators there,
he concluded.

Oscar Anderson spoke briefly on tne
teaching of the elements of music to
children by means of a simple marimba.
She played some songs composed by
children on a small marimba. I ollow

ney played several selections on a lull
