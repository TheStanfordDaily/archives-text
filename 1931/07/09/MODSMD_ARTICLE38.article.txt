Keith Gledhill, Stanford tennis star,
1 and Ellsworth Vines, Pasadena, added
new laurels to their many accomplish
ments when they won the national
i clay courts doubles tennis champion
j ship at St. Louis last Monday. Their
i opponents in the final round, Berkeley
Bell, New York, and Bruce Barnes,
Austin, Texas, were downed after a
hard four-set match, 6-3, 7-9, 10-8, 9-7.
Teamwork and steadier play won for
Gledhill and Vines. The sets were close
