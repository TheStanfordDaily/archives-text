# GREGOIRE CONCLUDES LECTURE SERIES ON BYZANTINE CULTURE
## New Series Of Lectures In French To Start Next Week 
### 
Pamprepius de Panapolis, one of the
last poets and statesmen who defended
Helenism, was the subject of the lec
ture on Byzantine Culture and Civiliza
tion given in the Little Theatre yes- i
terday afternoon by Professor Henri 1
Gregoire.
Professor Gregoire described the first i
schism in the Church, which occurred j
in Byzantium when Xenon, a barbarian
who became emperor, made a religious
compromise. Xenon's minister, Illus, !
had brought the poet Pamprepius to i
Constantinople under his protection, !
and in 476 created for him a chair at j
the University of Constantinople.
The lecturer told of Xenon's wife, J
Ariadne, who was influenced by her }
mother, Verine. Verine conspired
against Xenon, Illus, and Pamprepius,
who had become an important adviser i
and philosopher. Pamprepius became
an official when Verine was imprisoned. !
Because of Xenon's weakness, Illus |
expected to become emperor, but the j
power was assumed by another. Ac- I
cording to Professor Gregoire, Pampre- |
pius may possibly have been killed be- j
cause of treason against Xenon; the j
exact reason of his death is not known.
In concluding, Professor Gregoire
stated that recent finding of poems of
Pamprepius had proved that he was a
great poet in Greek.
The next of this sei-ies of lectures,
given in French, will be on next Wed
nesday in the Little Theatre. The pub
lic is invited.
