"More men are needed for the dou
bles handball tournament," says Harry
Maloney, director of minor sports and
sponser of the event. "Everyone is eli
gible with the exception of members
of the Men's Physical Education De
partment," announced Maloney.
The time limit for signing up has
been extended to the end of the week
in order that late comers might par
ticipate, states Maloney, who wants it
understood that the tournament is
purely for amateurs and that every
entrant has an equal chance.
Play will start next week. Two slip
over sweaters will be presented to the
winning combination.
