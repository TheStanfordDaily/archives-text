of being left to state institutions is the
belief of Dr. Norman Fenton, acting

fore the Education Club, Tuesday noon,
i Scientific techniques for dealing with
maladjusted juveniles are numerous,
Fenton pointed out. The need is for
knowledge of those techniques to be
spread so that there will be a trained

i community. In that way, he declared,
I much more could be done than under
j the present system, where delinquents
I are sent away from their homes and
' communities to state institutions.
"It is well known that the adult crimi-
I nal is the outcome of juvenile malad
justment," Fenton said. "It is ,also

i tible to treatment than adults. A far
j sighted educational and legislative pro
