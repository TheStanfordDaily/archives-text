# TEXTBOOK EXHIBIT TO OPEN ON MONDAY
## 
### 
â€¢ With about twenty-four of the lead
ing publishing houses of the country
represented, the annual Stanford Sum
mer Quarter textbook exhibit will open
on Monday in room 300 in the engi
neering cornel 1 . It will continue until
Friday of the same week. The exhibit,
though of special interest to students
of the educational department, presents
a large variety of publications. In addi
tion to textbooks, a large display of
maps and charts will be shown.
The exhibit is not limited to the field
of high-school and college textbooks;
primary books as well as works in other
fields are included.
"While the exhibit is distinctly not
a selling proposition," said Miss Dor
othy Putnam, secretary of the Depart
ment of Education. "The publishers
consider it good advertising, and prac
tically all send personal representatives
with each display. In this way the pub
lic receives full information direct from
the publishers."
Miss Putnam also stated that the at
tendance is not confined to students
of the University, but draws heavily
from Palo Alto and vicinity.
