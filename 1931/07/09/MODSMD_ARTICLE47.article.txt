# GRID TICKET RULINGS REVEALED BY B.A.C.
## 
### 
By the ruling of the Board of Athletic
Control adopted this year, students and
alumni are now in the same classifica
tion and both must apply for football
tickets on the regular applications
which the Board will mail out the last
of this month.
The change in allotment rules also
makes it necessary for every student
who expects to return to the University
for the fall quarter, either as graduate
or undergraduate, to file his or her
name with the Board before leaving
for his vacation. Anyone failing to do
so will not receive tickets.
Those students who are receiving or
have received degrees from Stanford
duriiig the year 1930-31 must file their
names and addresses with the Alumni
Secretary, as their applications will be
mailed from the Association records.
