# INCORRECT ADDRESSES CAUSE DELIVERY DELAYS SAYS POSTMASTER W. C. WERRY

caused by incorrect and incomplete ad
dresses, according to Postmaster W. C.
Werry, who advised students today to
inform their correspondents of their

"Stanford University." When merely
"Stanford"' is used in the address, it is
often confused with "Hanford," caus
ing delay and inconvenience. lie

dressed to Palo Alto, it is delayed at
least one delivery. General delivery
letters should be marked "General De
livery."
