# "POP" AND THORNHILL CHUG THROUGH WILDS IN ANCIENT FRANKLIN
## 
### 
"Pop" Warner has forsaken his teach
ing o£ gridiron strategy for the life of
a fisherman until September 1. Ac
companied by "Tiny" Thornhill he left
the campus at the close of his school
for football coaches, bound for the
lakes and streams of the Northwest.
The familiar old 1920 Franklin will
carry them to all of the famous parks
and lakes, including Yellowstone, Zion,
the Jackson Lake district in Wyoming,
and many of the lakes and streams of
Oregon.
"Pop" and "Tiny" will follow the
trail of the fish through Oregon, east
ern Washington, Montana, Wyoming,
and Colorado, territory well known to
"Pop" from his trip two years ago. At
that time, with "Chuck" Winterburn,
he became acquainted with many of
the so-called "fisherman's paradises,"
and is returning to drop his line in
these favorite spots.
A period of rest and relaxation is
"Pop's" objective in this trip, prepara
tory to a strenuous football season next
fall, when the moulding of a Stanford
varsity will occupy him once again.
Although practice does not begin until
the middle of September, the pair will
return on the first to fill a moving
picture contract.
