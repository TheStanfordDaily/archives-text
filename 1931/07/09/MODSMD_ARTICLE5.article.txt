# Olympic Trials To Be Here States Maloney
## Committee Members Favor Stanford As Site 
### 
In answer to recent reports that the
final Olympic tryouts will not be held
in the West, Coach Harry Maloney,
director of minor sports and member
|of the Olympic Games Committee,
makes the following statement:
"I firmly believe that recent reports
regarding the selection of the site for
! the final Olympic tryouts do not carry
J the true sentiments of the Olympic
j Track and Field Committee. The presi
| dent of the American Olympic Asso
ciation, Avery Brundage, told me per
i sonally when I saw him recently in
j Chicago, that he, himself, was in favor
|of Stanford rather ' than Los Angeles.
I had the same answer from Joe Eng
land, another member of the Olympic
! Association. His reasons were that
! Stanford is far enough removed from
! Los Angeles and San Francisco and is
| ideally located both for housing facili
i ties and athletic equipment.
"After having heard that from two
j men who are in a position to speak,
; I feel sure that before many days have
passed the decision of the American
I Track and Field Committee will be
j known and Stanford will receive a fa-
J vorable answer to the invitation ex
| tended to hold the trials on the cam
pus."
Brundage is now on his way West
j and will be on the campus about the
| middle of next month. At that time he
| will look over the University's athletic
equipment and accommodations, ac
: cording to Maloney.
Maloney's statement comes in answer
i to reports stating that Chicago would
| be named as a site for the tryouts.
