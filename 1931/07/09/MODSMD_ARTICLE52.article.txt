"The Spanish-American Woman at
Home and in Society" will be the sub
ject of the last of a series of lectures
given Monday night in the Little Thea
tre by Dr. Arturo Torres-Rioseco.
In his previous talks in Spanish, Pro
fessor Torres-Rioseco discussed the
ideals toward which Spanish-America
was aspiring and gave an insight into
the lives and culture of some of their
leaders, reflecting their viewpoint in
regard to interference from the United
States and other countries.
This last lecture, however, Torres-
Rioseco announced, would be given in
English on the subject, "The Spanish
American Woman," giving an idea of
her life at home and in society and
the position she occupies in the present
day world.
