# C. OF C. SCHOOL WILL BE LARGE
## Commercial Secretaries Plan For Session 
### 
j In spite of the current business de
pression the eleventh session of the
j Western School for Commercial Secre-
I taries will be far larger than any pre-
I vious one.
This statement was made yesterday
! by Leonard E. Read,- business manager
I of the School, which is sponsored by
j Stanford University and the United
j States Chamber of Commerce.
The general plan of the School this
I year is to bring about a change in the
| character of the Chambers of Com
: merce. According to Read, there is too
! much showmanship and "hooey" con
' nected with many Chambers instead of
sound business activities.
j "The means of effecting a change is
Iby trailing the secretaries, who will
. ultimately carry the new ideas back
; to their individual organizations.
"Another important problem before
j the School this year is taxation. It can
j be solved only by organized groups of
| business men, and since the Chamber
I of Commerce is the medium for busi
| ness, Commercial Secretaries will even
j tually be prime factors in the solution
! of taxation.
j "Many of America's foremost busi
ness men arc on the faculty, which is
j the best that the School has ever had,"
declared Read.
There will be a dinner held in the
| S'canford Union at 6:30 Sunday evening
for the Board of Governors and In
structors of the School.
