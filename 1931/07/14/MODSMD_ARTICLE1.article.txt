# ARTUR RODZINSKI SCORES DECISIVE HIT IN CONCERT
## Audience Applauds Leader's Dramatic Presentation Of Symphony Tschaikowsky's Composition Receives Masterful Handling 
### Staff Reviewer 
Under the energetic, decisive baton
of Artur Rodzinski, the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, playing on Sun
day afternoon in the Woodland Theatre
at Hillsborough, presented a program
of much dramatic interest. The selec
tions chosen presented a striking con
trast to the somewhat lighter and more
delicate music played in the preceding
concert when Sir Hamilton Harty con
ducted.
Remembering, perhaps, the striking
success Dr. Rodzinski achieved last
summer with Tschaikowsky's Fourth
Symphony, those who attended the
concert Sunday awaited with interest
his presentation of the great Russian
composer's Fifth Symphony. And judg
ing from the applause which they gave,
the audience was not disappointed.
Unfolds Story of Nation
While the Fifth Symphony does not
have the wide popular appeal of the
Sixth Symphony, the "Pathetique," it
reveals ihe same tragic, melancholy
qualities of the latter. Under Rod
zinski's sympathetic direction, the mu
sical picture of a nation revolting,
mourning, rejoicing, and finally con
quering, was unfolded.
Listeners will remember longest, no
doubt, the passionate andante of the
second movement of this symphony. In
troduced by the French horn, later
taken up by the cellos, the melody is
repeated in the various choirs, and then,
just before the end of the movement,
the sad song is accompanied by a
rumble from the tympani and bass
section. This furnishes the theme of the
piece.
Audience Acclaims Poem
Nearly as impressive is the triumphal
music of the last movement which tells
of the victory of a great cause. The
armies of liberty have fought and won.
Richard Strauss' majestic poem,
"Death and Transfiguration," opened
the second half of the concert. This,
the third of a series of tone-poems
composed by Strauss, is undoubtedly
the most popular of the three, and is
generally regarded as the most satis
factory from the structural and emo
tional viewpoint.
A poem written by Alexander Ritter
after the music was composed, de
scribes the piece as portraying the
death struggle of a sick man. The sleep
of exhaustion coming after a struggle,
the renewed struggle between the will
to live and the power of death, the
visions of the man's past life, the clang
of Death's last stroke, and, finally, the
deliverance from the world and the
transfiguration of the world—all these
steps are portrayed in this unforget
table composition. The emotional and
dramatic power of the music is un
deniable. Rodzinski gave a reading of
the poem that was enthusiastically ac
claimed by the listeners.
Wagner's "Valkyries" Introduced
Opening the program was the Over
ture to "The Bartered Bride" by Bed
rich Smetana. Presented for the first
time at these concerts, this overture
furnished a nice contrast to the heavier
music which followed it. In the words
of the composer it is something in a
"light and popular style."
As one critic has said: "There is
something in "The Bartered Bride"
that satisfies everyone—melody, life,
realism, and clever handling of the
orchestra."
Another number played for the first
time at Hillsborough, familiar though
it is to music lovers, was the "Ride of
the Valkyries" from Richard Wagner's
"Die Walkure." The wild, tempestuous
music portrays the ride of the Valky
ries, daughters of Wotan and Erda, as
they ride their war-steeds through the
storm clouds, taking the dead bodies of
heroes who have fallen in battle to
Valhalla.
Dr. Rodzinski will conduct again next
Sunday. Two unusual numbers will be
featured on the program; these are
George Gershwin's I'ecent composition,
"An American in Paris," and Ravel's
"Bolero."

composed by Strauss, is undoubtedly
the most popular of the three, and is
generally regarded as the most satis
factory from the structural and emo
tional viewpoint.
A poem written by Alexander Ritter
after the music was composed, de
scribes the piece as portraying the
death struggle of a sick man. The sleep
of exhaustion coming after a struggle,
the renewed struggle between the will
to live and the power of death, the
visions of the man's past life, the clang
of Death's last stroke, and, finally, the
deliverance from the world and the
transfiguration of the world—all these
steps are portrayed in this unforget
table composition. The emotional and
dramatic power of the music is un
deniable. Rodzinski gave a reading of
the poem that was enthusiastically ac
claimed by the listeners.
Wagner's "Valkyries" Introduced
Opening the program was the Over
ture to "The Bartered Bride" by Bed
rich Smetana. Presented for the first
time at these concerts, this overture
furnished a nice contrast to the heavier
music which followed it. In the words
of the composer it is something in a
"light and popular style."
As one critic has said: "There is
something in "The Bartered Bride"
that satisfies everyone—melody, life,
realism, and clever handling of the
orchestra."
Another number played for the first
time at Hillsborough, familiar though
it is to music lovers, was the "Ride of
the Valkyries" from Richard Wagner's
"Die Walkure." The wild, tempestuous
music portrays the ride of the Valky
ries, daughters of Wotan and Erda, as
they ride their war-steeds through the
storm clouds, taking the dead bodies of
heroes who have fallen in battle to
Valhalla.
Dr. Rodzinski will conduct again next
Sunday. Two unusual numbers will be
featured on the program; these are
George Gershwin's I'ecent composition,
"An American in Paris," and Ravel's
"Bolero."
Under the energetic, decisive baton
of Artur Rodzinski, the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, playing on Sun
day afternoon in the Woodland Theatre
at Hillsborough, presented a program
of much dramatic interest. The selec
tions chosen presented a striking con
trast to the somewhat lighter and more
delicate music played in the preceding
concert when Sir Hamilton Harty con
ducted.
Remembering, perhaps, the striking
success Dr. Rodzinski achieved last
summer with Tschaikowsky's Fourth
Symphony, those who attended the
concert Sunday awaited with interest
his presentation of the great Russian
composer's Fifth Symphony. And judg
ing from the applause which they gave,
the audience was not disappointed.
Unfolds Story of Nation
While the Fifth Symphony does not
have the wide popular appeal of the
Sixth Symphony, the "Pathetique," it
reveals ihe same tragic, melancholy
qualities of the latter. Under Rod
zinski's sympathetic direction, the mu
sical picture of a nation revolting,
mourning, rejoicing, and finally con
quering, was unfolded.
Listeners will remember longest, no
doubt, the passionate andante of the
second movement of this symphony. In
troduced by the French horn, later
taken up by the cellos, the melody is
repeated in the various choirs, and then,
just before the end of the movement,
the sad song is accompanied by a
rumble from the tympani and bass
section. This furnishes the theme of the
piece.
Audience Acclaims Poem
Nearly as impressive is the triumphal
music of the last movement which tells
of the victory of a great cause. The
armies of liberty have fought and won.
Richard Strauss' majestic poem,
"Death and Transfiguration," opened
the second half of the concert. This,
the third of a series of tone-poems
composed by Strauss, is undoubtedly
the most popular of the three, and is
generally regarded as the most satis
factory from the structural and emo
