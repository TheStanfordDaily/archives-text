Volumes from the library of the for
mer czar and czarina of Russia and
examples of present-day Communist
newspapers published in New York are
some of the material results of the
eastern trip of Nathan van Patten, di
rector of the University libraries, who
returned to the campus yesterday
morning.
The books from the royal library of
: the old Russian empire are beautiful
I examples of book-making, wholly aside
; from their historical value, and they
j will be placed on display in the ex
hibition cases in the Stanford Library
building when they have been cata
logued, probably at the beginning of
' the next college year.

J brarian van Patten selected volumes
J of greatest value and interest to the
j Hoover War Library.
