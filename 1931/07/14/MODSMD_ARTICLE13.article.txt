# ANNOUNCE PLANS FOR LANDSCAPING AT NEW PORTALS
## 
### 
Extensive landscaping about the
new gates leading into Palm
Drive, plus a plan to divide traffic
into two lanes, was announced to
day by A. L. Trowbridge, assist
ant comptroller. The architects
are Olmstead Brothers.
It is proposed that a triangular
flowerbed be centered in the
highway before the gates; this is
meant to split the drive into two
traffic strips. Northbound traffic
would enter the north lane. The
University is to suggest to the
Palo Alto council a similar flower
bed on the opposite side of the
highway, with the accompanying
division of roadway.
Improvements of footpaths arc
also included in the program.
