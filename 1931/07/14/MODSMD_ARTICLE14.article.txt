# Rioseco Contrasts Women of North And South
## Spanish-American Ladies Not Slow, Says Professor 
### 
Contrasts between the worhen of
Spanish America and those of North
America and Europe were drawn by
Professor Arturo Torres-Rioseco in his
lecture last night at the Little Theatre.
He also contradicted the general belief
that the women of Spain and South
America have always been in a state of
subjection.
"Since the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, Spanish drama and history
cites numerous instances in which
woman has not only held positions as
man's equal but has surpassed man in
deeds and accomplishments," said Rio
seco.
Many Lead in Professions
Dr. Rioseco illustrated his points by
telling stories; of women, who attired
in men's clothing fought duels either
to avenge their own honor or that of
some other woman of their family. In
spiritual leadership and thought he
mentioned Santa Theresa who was not
only an outstanding writer of the six
teenth century but who also organized
more than thirty convents.

Women in co-educational schools of
South America today are studying law,
medicine, engineering, just as they are
in North America. Through the efforts
of the "Congreso femenino," they are
struggling to have antiquated laws re
vised and have already secured changes
in property and divorce legislation.

While women in South America hold
j positions in all business and profession
' al fields, such as doctors, lawyers, con
' suls, secretaries to embassies, and en
gineers, probably one of the most un
j usual situations is that all the street
car conductors in Chile are women, it
j was pointed out.

Dr. Hioseco also spoke of Gabriela
: Mistral, Juana de Ibarbourou and Al
: fonsina Storm as being three of the
J outstanding writers and leaders of
| thought in South America. They are
i not only well known in their country,
! but also in Europe.
"Although the women of Spanish
i America have not been dominated and
| have accomplished many things intel
j lectually, socially, and politically, their
| main purpose and instinct has been atrd
' probably always will be the creation of
a home," said Rioseco in conclusion.

Contrasts between the worhen of
Spanish America and those of North
America and Europe were drawn by
Professor Arturo Torres-Rioseco in his
lecture last night at the Little Theatre.
He also contradicted the general belief
that the women of Spain and South
America have always been in a state of
subjection.
"Since the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, Spanish drama and history
cites numerous instances in which
woman has not only held positions as
man's equal but has surpassed man in
deeds and accomplishments," said Rio
seco.
Many Lead in Professions
Dr. Rioseco illustrated his points by
telling stories; of women, who attired
in men's clothing fought duels either
to avenge their own honor or that of
some other woman of their family. In
spiritual leadership and thought he
mentioned Santa Theresa who was not
only an outstanding writer of the six
teenth century but who also organized
more than thirty convents.

Women in co-educational schools of
South America today are studying law,
medicine, engineering, just as they are
in North America. Through the efforts
of the "Congreso femenino," they are
struggling to have antiquated laws re
vised and have already secured changes
in property and divorce legislation.

While women in South America hold
j positions in all business and profession
' al fields, such as doctors, lawyers, con
' suls, secretaries to embassies, and en
gineers, probably one of the most un
j usual situations is that all the street
car conductors in Chile are women, it

: fonsina Storm as being three of the
J outstanding writers and leaders of
