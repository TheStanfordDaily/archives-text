# ANCIENT WRITING BOARDS BEAR TESTIMONY OF MANY EXAMS
## 
### 
Memorials to innumerable examina
j tions are to *be found on the window
i sills in front of the Assembly Hall,
i where the writing boards which have
} supplied firm surfaces for the writers
of many a blue book are now awaiting
t their next mid-quarter or final. Accord
ing to the scribblings on the boards,
| examinations in psychology, biology,
1 and citizenship are heavily represented,
! with a few in economics and one apti
tude test are indicated also.
"Note all flunks on this board here,"
is the suggestion made by one unknown
I student, and he has put numbers down
the left side of the board. At present
1 seven of the spaces have been filled by
pessimistic undergraduates, the last
entry being "Cit midquarter, May,
' 1931." Confidence that the averages of
j future classes will be kept down by
flunks is expressed by the column of
1 numbers, which continues through 18,
' with plenty of room on the other side
for the classes of 1940.
An expressive tribute is paid in the
i scribbling, "X marks the spot where
la Cit final was flunked," in the count

r less remarks such as "Psychology final
' —all over!" "Aptitude test, 1927, oh, oh,"
j and in A.B.L.'s "Biology final—all over
j now!"
' Comments in a more serious vein,
i and not intended for curious eyes, are
to be found on nearly every board,
j and bear testimony to the struggle to
remember information studied the night
! before. Several trials at spelling one
word, such as "separate," are to be
' found often, and lists of the presidents
j of the United States, with their re
, spective dates, are numerous. "Pithe-
I canthropus, Heidelberg, Piltdown,
! Neanderthal, Cromagnon," is a series
i of names which may be recognized by
I first-quarter citizenship students, who
! are confronted by the evidences of evc
j lution.
The majority of the boards are of a
I dark gray material, which does not
| permit one to see remarks on them at
first glance, or to write on them with
much effect. However, the oldest ones
are light tan, and because of their age
' and light color, have accumulated a
| large amount of testimony to examina
i tions of past years.

the left side of the board. At present
1 seven of the spaces have been filled by
pessimistic undergraduates, the last
entry being "Cit midquarter, May,
' 1931." Confidence that the averages of
j future classes will be kept down by
flunks is expressed by the column of
1 numbers, which continues through 18,
' with plenty of room on the other side
for the classes of 1940.
An expressive tribute is paid in the
i scribbling, "X marks the spot where
la Cit final was flunked," in the count

r less remarks such as "Psychology final
' —all over!" "Aptitude test, 1927, oh, oh,"
j and in A.B.L.'s "Biology final—all over
j now!"
' Comments in a more serious vein,
i and not intended for curious eyes, are
to be found on nearly every board,
j and bear testimony to the struggle to
remember information studied the night
! before. Several trials at spelling one
word, such as "separate," are to be
' found often, and lists of the presidents
j of the United States, with their re
, spective dates, are numerous. "Pithe-
I canthropus, Heidelberg, Piltdown,
! Neanderthal, Cromagnon," is a series
i of names which may be recognized by
I first-quarter citizenship students, who
! are confronted by the evidences of evc
j lution.
The majority of the boards are of a
I dark gray material, which does not
| permit one to see remarks on them at
first glance, or to write on them with
much effect. However, the oldest ones
are light tan, and because of their age
' and light color, have accumulated a
| large amount of testimony to examina
i tions of past years.
Memorials to innumerable examina
j tions are to *be found on the window
i sills in front of the Assembly Hall,
i where the writing boards which have
} supplied firm surfaces for the writers
of many a blue book are now awaiting
t their next mid-quarter or final. Accord
ing to the scribblings on the boards,
| examinations in psychology, biology,
1 and citizenship are heavily represented,
! with a few in economics and one apti
tude test are indicated also.
"Note all flunks on this board here,"
is the suggestion made by one unknown
I student, and he has put numbers down
the left side of the board. At present
1 seven of the spaces have been filled by
pessimistic undergraduates, the last
