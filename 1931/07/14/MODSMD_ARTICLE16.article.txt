# STUDENTS' CREDIT RATINO SURVEYED
## Credit Men's Statistics Show Collegians Good Risk

"Stanford students pay their bills,"
says H. J. McArthur, Manager of the
Palo Alto Merchants Association, "even
| better than the average set up by a
i recent survey of six college towns, of
| which Palo Alto was one, by the Na-
I tional Retail Credit Association.
This survey made in six college
| towns showed that students clear their
j bills in an average of 56 days as com
pared to 70 for other people. The re-
I port to the convention states that 55
! per cent of the students carry charge
j accounts. Of these, only one-half of
I one per cent can never be collected.
The universities surveyed were Cor
j nell, Princeton, Dartmouth, Stanford,
Wellesley, and Vassar. As there are
' two co-educational institutions, two
men's, and two women's schools, it was
| felt that a cross-section would be
| shown.
It is believed that the large number
J of accounts being settled in such a short
time was due to the fact that parents
who take the trouble to send their
j children to college will take the trouble
to impress on them the importance of
| settling their bills promptly.
During the summer there are rela
! tively few calls to the association, ac
i cording to McArthur, inasmuch as the
i average summer quarter student either
pays cash or does not buy anything as
he is likely to come from home fully
furnished. However, those that do ask
for credit pay up as the regular stu
, dents do.

The report also states that women
j settle more promptly than do men. An
average of 30 days for Wellesley and
157 for Vassar stands against 60 and
! over for some of the men's schools.

The few students that are behind in
their payments usually either charge
things with the deliberate intention of
taking a long time to pay, or are car
ried off their feet by college life and
spend beyond their means.
