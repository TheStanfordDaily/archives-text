I CJEVENTY-NINE secretaries and their wives were registered at liranner Hall
yesterday, as the eleventh annual session of the Western School for Com
mercial Secretaries convened. California, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho
I)o fewer things well and leave freak activities alone, was the theme of the
chambers of commerce were all well represented at the opening meeting.
I first-day speakers. Disagreement was voiced as to whether members and moral
; support were more important than money in chamber of commerce work. How
ever, most of the speakers concurred in the belief that the trend is away from

social civic activities to community
business enterprise.
"The depression is throwing all non
essential activities, such as the carnival
and the potato race, into the scrap heap
in favor of more permanently remu
nerative civic activities," declared
Christy Thomas, Seattle chamber
speaker.
More Tangible Service Promised
It was pointed out that secretaries
were slowly educating themselves for
more tangible community service
through group discussions such as the
present convention provides. This self
training is considered doubly important
because the universities are not train
ing men for chamber of commerce
work. Several speakers suggested that
the university and the high school
should educate the public regarding
this type of community service.
After crossing the Mississippi to come
to the convention, Morris Edwards,
United States chamber speaker, de
clared that the spirit and viewpoint he
found here in the West caused him to
scrap crystallized ideas and resolve 1o
start his series of talks on taxation
"where others end —and what to do
about it."
"Financial and social stability are
threatened by higher tax rates, which
really mean less revenue and more de
linquencies when they are 20 per cent
beyond the ability of people to pay,"
he declared. "Business exerts a con
stant pressure on the commerce cham
ber to promote trade and thereby sta
bilize net profits. Economy is wise
spending under a sound fiscal policy."
Publicity Must Be Attractive
"The directiton from which to survey
the taxation problem is from the spend
ing end since that is community-wide
and does not affect only a special
stratum as obtaining revenue does,'"
Edwards stated.
Bruce A. Findlay of the Los Angeles
chamber told the assemblage, "Too
many secretaries apologize for their
existence and keep quiet about their
work. Publicity must weild more than
it costs and it must be made attractive.
Satisfied members and public speakers
do more good in boosting than news
papers, house organs, and other me
diums."
At the afternoon session James A.
Ford of Spokane talked on retail trade
activities, and Ralph Bradford, United
States chamber delegate, conducted a
round table on the secretaray and his
job.
