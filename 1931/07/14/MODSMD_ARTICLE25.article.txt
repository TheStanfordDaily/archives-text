The cilv of Palo Alto seems lo liave no end of animal troubles
these davs. The animals do tilings that are not legal and within
the law. The dogs hite people and the toads induce the people
lo gamble. The city has been lighting for the last year lo keep
unleashed dogs off the streets, and now that this menace has
been somewhat quieted down, along come the horned loads and
breaks the anti-gambling law.
Last week the Palo Alio Post of the American Legion an
nounced a horned load race lo be staged on July 21 as a unique
sporting event in the city's history. The contestants were to be
entered by various business firms, and prizes were to be awarded
to the first load that leaped out of a marked circle.
Hut Chief of Police Howard A. /ink announced lasl Friday
afternoon that Ihe toad derby will not be allowed because the
event comes under Ihe slate anti-betting law.
Evidently the city of Palo Alto believes that Ihe awarding of
prizes and the evils of betting go hand in hand. In that case the
next step should be the abolition of dope sheets and prizes for
the person that guesses the correct score in local sporting events.
