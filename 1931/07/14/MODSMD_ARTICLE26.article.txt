# THE 						UNDERLINER
## 
### 
In spite of all the disparaging words Hint have boon written
about sllc 11 people, there slill live and flourish those omnipresent
bores who underline library books. Xo volume is secure from
this pest's insidious pencil. With absolute self-compliance he
goes about his appointed task with paranoica] persistency.
The main objection to the practice lies not so much in the
fact that he systematically underlines the very passages that no
one else thinks important, but that lie assumes that the books
should be underlined and annotated at all. Xo doubt as to the
value of his contributions seems ever to flicker across his mind.
And, of course, the practice of underlining books not one's
own is dishonest. It is highly probable in most cases that the
books tlit' "underliners" read will, in the course of lime, be read
bv someone else. Moreover, it is not unlikely that the subsequent
reader will be searching for points different from those that
occupied the man with the pencil.
However, all this has been said before, many times. Hut,
human nature being what it is, il will have to be repeated many
times before anv material results will be obtained.
