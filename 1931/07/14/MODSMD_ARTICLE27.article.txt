# LIFE IS LIKE TINS

Students interested in observing the vagaries of human na
ture can find a wealth of material at the swimming pool these
days. There, stripped of the habiliments of civilization (we're
speaking of the men's pool!), outward individuality is reduced
to a minimum and personality cannot be enhanced bv artificial
means.
There is something of pagan abandon expressed in the
bronzed bodies that are sprawled around the edges of the tanks.
Relaxed and receptive of the beneficent ravs of the sun, these
figures express varied thoughts as they lie with eves closed and
apparently unconscious of anyone else's proximity. Perhaps
those thoughts and ideas that lie in the fringe between con
sciousness and unconsciousness produce those slight modifica
tions of the features that one notices. At any rate, it is not ex
pressions of intense thought or worry that mark their features,
but seemingly dreams, ambitions, and longings.
The show-offs, the timid, the self-possessed, and the self
conscious are in the pool. Hut there is equal unconcern on the
part of the sun-bathers over either the awkward struggles of
the beginner or the smooth form of the skilled. It takes a
champion to arouse any interest.
Hut now and then there erne rges from this group of nil
noticed ones an object lesson in some phase of character. For
instance, one afternoon not long ago a certain husky, bronzed
fellow began trying some dives off one of the springboards. Not
merely dives, but fancy dives he essayed. And repeatedly he
failed, resoundingly. Time after time he hurtled through the
air, only to strike the water flat on his stomach or bis back.
Flops that would discourage less determined men only spurred
him on. lie made no appreciable improvement during the whole
time, but one felt he would continue until he had mastered
those dives. And he aroused the languid sun-bathers somewhat
from their torpor maybe awoke in tliein something of admira
tion, though none was shown.
