THE MAN IN POSSESSION—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
Robert Montgomery, Charlotte Green
wood, Irene Purcell, ;md Aubrey Smith
breeze through clever dialogue and hu-
I morous situations for a couple of hours
: of entertainment. Although the story is
taken from the play of the same name
by H. M. Harwood, many of the lines
j were written by P. G. Wodehouse, a
j fact which at least partially expl lins
j its sophisticated wit.
Montgomery is cast as Ray Dabney,
I carefree young son of a wealthy Eng
lish family who has not done too much
! to uphold the good name of Dabney.
j His parents decide that it would be for
j the better if he would go away to
I America or some place, but he doesn't
like the idea and decides to shift for
' himself. He starts looking for work and
is immediately successful in securing a
• position as a deputy of the law. His first
| job is to serve papers of foreclosure on
) a young lady who has failed to meet
j her obligations in business. He takes
j "possession" and rules for a night and
! a day.
! The inevitable bedroom scene is pres
-1 ent.

JUST A GlGlLO—Varsity Theatre.
With the rumor current that this pic
: ture just escaped the local censors' ax,
it will likely be quite popular. Follow
ers of the carefree and wisecracking
! Haines will be just a little disappointed,
however. As an English lord, playing
the part of a gigilo in Paris, he is toned
j down considerably and only on one or
I two occasions is the familiar Haines
I reconizable. The young English lady,
! luscious, loquacious, and lovable, is
j played by Irene Purcell. She is eager
for life and adventure in the wicked
Franch capital and eventually becomes
j connected with our gigilo hero. Alter
| a series of rather dull but suggestive
, circumstances the picture ends with
: true Anglo-Saxon propriety and every
' one is happy.
There is the usual comedy replete
: with trite situations which must be en
; dured unless one is fortunate enough
to arrive late, a news reel which is
; more boring than ordinarily, and a
j short golf lesson by Johnny Farrell.
