# RUSSIAN FARCE PRESENTS SATIRE, ACTION, FOREIGN FLAVOR IN DRAMA SEASON OPENING
## 
### David Lamson 
Interesting through its foreign flavor,
amusing in its broad satire of official
dom, rich in its opportunities for actors
and director to give sweep to their
talents, "The Inspector General" pro
vided a popular opening for Summer
Quarter dramatics in the Assembly Hall
last Friday night.
It was 100 years ago that Nikolai
Gogol first offered this satiric farce on
official life in Russia. Portraying a set
of small-town officers in all their
stupidity and greed and meannesses,
one feels that the author perhaps had
bigger game over the sights of this
blunderbus of a play. Certainly there
i are few political and social abuses that
fail to draw fire, and by no means all
! of the follies are things of the past,
i Friday night's audience found much of
j modern interest in the play, despite
(he quaint costumes.
Production Helvenston's Own
As always, Director Harold Helven
ston made the production peculiarly
his own. He has a fine sense of farce,
and his direction here was subtle and
intelligent. The play proceeded at
break-neck speed, in a surging roar
1 of action that carried the audience with
j it willy-nilly.
Every character but one was exag
gerated to the utmost; every action was
thrown completely out of focus. The
I result was the head-over-heels carica
! ture that the author "must have in
! tended," an effect tremendously height
ened by the utter realism of the one
! character mentiond, Hlestakov, played
by Paul Speegle, and by the quietly
natural settings provided by that self
i effacing genius, Fred Stover.
Speegle Dominates Cast
By means of his technical skill, his

chairm, and a luscious part, Speegle
dominated the cast. His long and fatu
ous monologue in the second act was a
masterpiece; every scene in which he
appeared was interesting and effective.
More difficult was the task of David
Dickey as the rascally mayor, requir
ing a steady flow of bombast and tem
per in every scene in which Speegle
did not appear. He gave a very good
best to this job, and apart from one or
two slightly slow scenes in the first
act maintained a high level of frenzy
throughout.
Harry Lee Logan gave a skilled per
formance as Shepkin, the slimy, tale
bearing postmaster. The others of the
village "ring," Henry Kleinbach, Wal
ter Hempstead, Jr., George Casler, and
Howard Custer, gave satisfying and
intelligent performances. And this is
as good a time as any to congratulate
cast and director on the fact that lines
were both clear and audible.
Gigantic Marionette Effective
Catherine Musante played a highly
farcical part as the mayor's wife in a
manner convincingly unreal, while Lu
cille Morgan submerged her talents to
make the mayor's daughter a wooden
doll. Joseph Whitaker as Osip, Marian
Littlefield as a maid, and Jean Carson
as a soldier's wife, contributed memor
able bits. Cary Odell and Boyd Home
wood introduced some of the best com
edy of the piece. The others of the
numerous cast earned our thanks and
congratulations on their success in
maintaining the spirit and color of the
piece.
An interesting note was in the intro
duction of the real Inspector General
as a gigantic and grotesque marionette
â€”an effective conception, and one ori
ginal with Helvenston.
