# MATCH BOX CRAZE HiTS TOYON HALL
## 
### 
Toy on Hall has been struck by a new
fad—the fad of match box collecting.

This new hobby has been sweeping
the country for the last few months
and has finally been introduced on the
campus by the Summer Quarter stu
dents from out of the state.
"Practically every freshman room,"
according to Janitor Salvador Barillas,
"has a collection or is starting a col
lection."

The craze was started last year in
New York as an advertising stunt by a
popular match manufacturing company.
The first person to collect five hundred
match booklets was to receive a prize
of a thousand dollars. The prize money
was won by a Chicago youth, and in
stead of dying out, ihe fad has con
tinued to spread until it now covers
the nation.
Over in Toyon Hall, the empty match
booklets are hung on strings and
draped along the walls and doors and
serve as a unique room decoration.
"One student oh the second floor,"
said Salvador, "has a thousand match
booklets representing every state in the
Union. The booklets are arranged ac
cording to the business houses they
represent, and furnish a hobby as in
teresting as coin or stamp collecting."
