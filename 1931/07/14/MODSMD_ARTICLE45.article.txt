"The first-round tennis matchcs are
being run ofT too slowly," says Coach
Elwyn B. Bugge, director of the an
nual summer tennis tournament. "A
great many matches are going to be
lost through default unless the players
take the initiative and arrange for their
match before Friday."
To date the only matches conjpleted
are: Osborne defeated Kaulfers, 6-8,
6-0, 6-1; Burn defeated Byrd, 6-1, 6-0;
and Onishi defeated Proctor, 6-0, 6-0.
Estimates of the probable finalists will
not be made until more matches have
been finished, said Bugge.
