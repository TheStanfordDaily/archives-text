# Highy to Speak on Napoleon Here Tonight
## "Little General" As National Idol Is Subject 
### 
In the regular Tuesday evening pro
gram in the Little Theatre tonight at 8
o'clock, Chester P. Higby, acting pro
fessor of history from the University
of Wisconsin, will lecture on Napoleon.

Professor Higby has been interested
in Napoleon for twenty years, and espe
cially in the extension of French in
stitutions during the Napoleonic period,
and so is well prepared, after such a
specialization, to speak on the subject.

"I shall not talk much about Napo
leon as a general, or Napoleon with
women, or any of the usual subjects
treated in connection with him, but I
shall talk about Napoleon as the na
tional idol of France," said Higby. He
will explain why the "Little General"
has such a hold on the French people,
and why, in spite of his many contri
butions to countries outside of France,
he has a hold on their imaginations,
but none at all on their affections.
Professor Higby has given seminar
courses in the subject at the two uni
versities where he has taught regularly,
and is giving one here this summer. He
has also supervised a great many doc
tor's theses written on various phases
of the life and accomplishments of
France's most famous hero.
