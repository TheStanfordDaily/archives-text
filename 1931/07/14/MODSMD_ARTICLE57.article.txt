# LONG BUNGALOW IS BEST IN LONG RUN FOR LONG DISTANCEâ€”BUT MOTOR LONGS TO STOP
## 
### 
'"Travel in comfort" might well be
the maxim of Fred C. Long of North
Dakota. When he came west to enroll
in the School of Education he brought
along a fully equipped bungalow and a
parcel of extras.
The bungalow is mounted on a ten
year-old chassis and motor, and con
tains everything offered with an
"apartmentette" or a "bungalowette"
with a couple of closets and a side
door thrown in.
Long, principal of the State Agricul
tural High School at Velva, North Da
kota, was accompanied on his motor
trip by his wife and Billy, their 11-
months-old baby, and Mrs. Long's
brother.
His comfortable "ark on wheels" was
threatened with disaster on the Idaho
plains when his venerable motor
snapped a vital organ and wheezed
painfully to a halt. Worse still, there
was no chance of replacing the part

until they reached Salt Lake City,
many miles away.
Long wiped beads of chagrin from
his brow and looked around. He spied
a farmhouse in the distance, and for
no reason at all, he insists, started for
it by the heel and toe. There he dis
covered an abandoned engine of Ihe
same model as his own (really, Mr.
Ripley), and in three hours he and his
brother-in-law had switched parts and
were on their way again.
The Long vehicle is built as wide as
the law allows. As a result the natives
using Yosemite's narrow roads scurried
hastily for the side of the highway
when they came face to face with the
house on wheels.
With but one exception Long was
boss of the road. When the exception
occurred his outfit forfeited its left door
to a much larger contraption.
But nevertheless all the Longs agree
that theirs is the best way to travel.
