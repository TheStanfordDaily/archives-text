# DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC NEEDED AT STANFORD DECLARES JULIUS GOLD
## 
### 
That Stanford University cannot con
tinue much longer without a Depart
ment of Music, is the opinion of Julius
Gold, member of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra.

"Music as a topic for study should
have a place in the curriculum of every
university in the country," says Gold,
who is conducting an eight-week
course in "Foundations of Musical Art"
at Stanford this summer. He continues:

"I am not in favor, however, of the
policy within college systems which
sets music apart in a distinct 'school'
or 'conservatory,' or which groups
music with other expressional arts in
a 'school of fine art.'

"The policy which makes music a
'chair' or 'department' like other sub
jects, with a professor who is a mem
ber of the general faculty, merely
identifies a prerequisite of any modern
college system. Surely this is a point
that cannot be gainsaid.
"It is my fervent hope that Stanford
University may soon find the way to
establishing a Chair of Music commen
surate with her other departments."
Long a teacher of m.usical theory,
Gold taught Max Dolin, Otto Salz, Otto
Cesana, Lajos Fenster, as well as other
composers and players throughout the
United States. From 1910 to 1914 he
was professor of harmony, theory, and
history of music at Drake University,
in lowa.
In June the Chicago Musical College
conferred upon Gold the honorary de
gree of Master of Music, in recognition
of his authority in modern theory and
harmony. He is a disciple and exponent
of Bernard Ziehn, regarded by many
critics as one of the greatest of musical
theorists; and has perpetuated Ziehu's
work since the latter's death in 1912.

Gold heartily agrees with Walter
£)amrosch, recent guest of honor on
the campus, who opined that, "the col
lege has the great responsibility of
giving its students an appreciation of
music."
