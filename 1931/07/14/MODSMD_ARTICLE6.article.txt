# WILBURS LEAVE HERE FOR SUMMER CAMP
## 
### 
Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur have
left for their summer, camp on the
north fork of the American river where
they expect to spend the greater part
of the summer.
While in the Bay Region, Dr. Wilbur
has been attending to business con
nected with the University, and with
the Interior Department. He was a
guest of the Commonwealth Club last
week when Elwood Mead, United
States Commissioner of Reclamations,
spoke on reclamation of the Hoover
dam.
Secretary Wilbur hopes to return
to the campus before resuming his
duties in Washington at the end of the
summer.
