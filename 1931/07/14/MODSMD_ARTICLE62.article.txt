# 'THE GOD WE CHOOSE' ALBERT SERMON TOPIC
## 
### 
"The Inevitable God and the God
Whom We Choose," was the theme of
the sermon delivered on Sunday morn
ing by the Rev. Albert W. Palmer in
Memorial Chapel.

That one must learn the way of life
through the right moral decisions,
through choice of that which is good
and beautiful, and through worship of
the Christ, was emphasized by the Rev.
Palmer.

"He who chooses none of these
things, closes the door behind himself
and leaves God outside," the speaker
said.
