# MODERN SCHOOL IN MUSIC TO BE SUNDAY FEATURE
## Society Seeks Variation In Programs Of Summer Concerts Rodzinski Declared Favorite Of Woodland Theatre Audiences 
### 
Music of the "modern school" will be
featured in the open air concert at the
Woodland Theatre next Sunday. Artur
Rodzinski, permanent conductor of the
Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra,
will conduct again.

One of the definite policies of the
Philharmonic Society of Sun Mateo
County, according to Mrs. Leonora
Armsby, chairman, is to include each
year a number of the works of con
temporary composers interspersed with
the performance of the familiar classics.
They strive to arrange programs which
will assure an interesting variation from
the winter series of concerts.

The afternoon's symphony will be
Scriabin's Third, which is most fre
quently referred to and known as "The.
Divine Poem." It has been explained
as the musical expression of the com
poser's idea of the liberation of spirit
from its temporal fettersâ€”the affirma
tion of personality, and is generally
recognized as one of the greatest works
of this gifted Russian composer.
Will Repeat "Bolero"
For sheer novelty, an intriguing
musical description by George Gersh
win, '"An American in Paris," will be
included. It will be heard Sunday for
the first time at these concerts.
Dr. Rodzinski has also elected to in
clude in this program a number which
was most enthusiastically received last
season, the ' Bolero," by Ravel. In his
program last summer, Ravel's Ballet
music from "Daphnis and Chloe" was
presented.
Opening the program will be a num
ber particularly appropriate to the na
tural setting of the theatre. It is that
delightful overture to Weber's opera,
"Oberon," which musically portrays
the summoning of the fairies, and in
timates the events to transpire* in the
unfolding of the opera.
Conducted Many European Orchestras
Dr. Artur Rodzinski, who has become
a favorite with the Hillsborough audi
ences, was born at Spalato, Dalmatia,
of Polish parents. After completing a
musical education in Lemberg, Rod
zinski went to Vienna, where he had
the advantage of many of Europe's best
teachers. After the war, in 1919, he be
came conductor of the Lemberg Opera
and later was appointed first conductor
of the Warsaw Opera and Philharmonic
Orchestra.

Leopold Stokowski, conductor of the
Philadelphia Orchestra, while traveling
in Europe, was so impressed with Rod
zinski's accomplishments that he per
suaded the latter to come to America.
In 1925 Rodzinski was made associate
conductor with Stokowski. From there
he went to the Los Angeles Philhar
monic, the position he now holds.
