Chicago Plan a Highlight
Recent changes at the University of

than four years.
"That Stanford, Yale, and Harvard !
were in a group tending to less drastic j
educational curricula of the newer |
type, was evident and much discussed," |
Professor Robinson mentioned. He also }
pointed out that Chicago and Wiscon
sin have perhaps gone farthest in relat- !
ing the superior student to graduate j
work. This is especially true of the I
five-year program at Chicago, he said— j
a provision for two years in upper j
division and three in graduate studies, t

many deans of graduate schools," Pro- :
lessor Robinson remarked.
Wisconsin is beginning a plan for
giving certificates of graduation after j

graduation from lower division on an i
honor point basis, were other high
lights of the convention.
