# De Wolf Hopper Relates Trials of Being "Ko-Ko"
## 
### 
A weary Lord High Executioner, but ,
! a man ready for conversation and a I
; substantial dinner, was found by the j
j Daily reporter who yesterday visited ,
' the back-stage dressing room of Do {
Wolf Hopper, who is playing at the j
Tivoli Opera House in San Francisco |
; in a revival of Gilbert and Sullivan's j
| "The Mikado," in his fifty-third year !
on the siage. His debut was made in j
1879 in "Our Boys," when he was 21. j
! Still in his make-up as Ko-Ko, the :
Lord High Executioner of Japan, Mr. j
Hopper was smoking his pipe and read- j
ing the morning paper. At the first j
1 mention of Stanford, the actor burst !
I into praise of the campus.
"I love Stanford's mission type oi j
buildings, and when I am living in j
I Oakland I frequently drive down there.
| For sheer pictorial beauty, Stanford
j surpasses any university I have seen,
i I root for you, except when you play
I football against West Point."
West Point Students Best Behaved
The famous actor, who is a footbail
! fan and a lover of college activities,
! said that West Point is his favorite |
j school, and that he has always enjoyed j
playing there and has found the mili- j
tary students the best behaved college J
audience that he has encountered. On !
I the subject of college students he also j
' said that he considers the University of i
Minnesota a "corking good university," j
i and told of the time when he played j
1 in "The Mikado"' there, with a cast j
and stage-crew of university students. |
I "Everything was done to perfection," j
| he said, referring to the work of the (
{students.

. These reminiscences were intcr
i ruptcd by the entrance of his wife,
i Lillian Glaser, who is appearing as
! Yum-Yum, and of H. C. Howard, who
plays Pish-Tush. After remarking on
I the pleasant audience of the afternoon's
| performance, Miss Glaser and Mr.
i Howard left to get some dinner for
i Mr. Hopper, who refilled his pipe and
turned the conversation to the subject
j of Ko-Ko.
His Stooping Walk Most Difficult
"People talk about how hard it must
be to fall on the floor and roll across
the stage, but they don't realize that
; the hardest thing to do is to walk the
I way I have to," he said. In several parts
i of the opera he has to fall to the
! ground, and at the end of the selection,
| "The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring,
Tra-la," he rolls across the stage. How
ever, he has his legs well padded with
cloth for the falls, and says that the
most uncomfortable feature of the part
is the stooping way in which he has to
walk.
"Ko-Ko was a cringing little cur,"
Mr. Hopper remarked, and added that
! he was forced to walk in a bent posi
j tion which makes him appear smaller,
j since he is rather large for the part,
j Miss Glaser and Mr. Howard had re
! turned, bearing a well-faden tray, and
I placed the meal on a low table before
the Lord High Executioner. The latter,
j remarking that Ko-Ko's gown must be
| protected from any traces of pork
i chops, salad, pie, or coffee, spread a
| make-up smeared towel on his lap and
j began to cut a chop.
i "Now you see him as he is!" he
! called after the departing reporter.

I into praise of the campus.

buildings, and when I am living in j
I Oakland I frequently drive down there.
| For sheer pictorial beauty, Stanford

West Point Students Best Behaved
The famous actor, who is a footbail
! fan and a lover of college activities,
! said that West Point is his favorite |
j school, and that he has always enjoyed j
playing there and has found the mili- j
tary students the best behaved college J
audience that he has encountered. On !
I the subject of college students he also j
' said that he considers the University of i
Minnesota a "corking good university," j
i and told of the time when he played j
1 in "The Mikado"' there, with a cast j
and stage-crew of university students. |
I "Everything was done to perfection," j
| he said, referring to the work of the (
{students.

. These reminiscences were intcr
i ruptcd by the entrance of his wife,
i Lillian Glaser, who is appearing as
! Yum-Yum, and of H. C. Howard, who
plays Pish-Tush. After remarking on
I the pleasant audience of the afternoon's
| performance, Miss Glaser and Mr.
i Howard left to get some dinner for
i Mr. Hopper, who refilled his pipe and
turned the conversation to the subject
j of Ko-Ko.
His Stooping Walk Most Difficult
"People talk about how hard it must
be to fall on the floor and roll across
the stage, but they don't realize that
; the hardest thing to do is to walk the
I way I have to," he said. In several parts
i of the opera he has to fall to the
! ground, and at the end of the selection,
| "The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring,
Tra-la," he rolls across the stage. How
ever, he has his legs well padded with
cloth for the falls, and says that the
most uncomfortable feature of the part
is the stooping way in which he has to
walk.
