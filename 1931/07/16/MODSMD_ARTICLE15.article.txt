# RUSSIAN VOLUMES REVEAL WAR PACTS
## Van Patten Collects Rare Books In East 
### 
Russian military secrets are con
tained in the books secured by Li
brarian Nathan van Patten during his
recent trip to New Yoi'k and other
Eastern cities.
A collection of 43 volumes pertaining
to the general administration of the
Russian general staff, formerly in the
library of His Imperial Majesty Aleksiei
Nikolaevich, the contents of which
were forbidden to be divulged or pub
lished, are among the most interesting
selected by Mr. van Patten.
War Preparations Information
There are also six volumes and an
atlas on preparations for war in tech
nical, economical, and political respects
published in 1898 and written by I. S.
Bliokh.
â€¢ Two volumes contain secret informa
tion regarding the armed forces of
Austro-Hungary and Norway, which
were also published by the Russian
general staff:
Dimitri Krassovsky, Russian biblio
grapher at the Stanford Library, fondly
handled the handsomely bound Moroc
can leather books, exquisitely tooled in
gold. Among them was one called the
"Storm of the East," a Russo-Japanese
story by D. lanchevelsky, bound in red
and bearing the seal of Czar Nicholas
11.
Soviets Sell Treasures
There were also books beautifully
bound in white leather and moire, with
lettering and designs of gold, which
came from the personal library of the
Czarina. One of these is called the
House of Romanoff, or a History of the
First Military Cadet School, by N. V.
Khimshiev.
Each member of the royal family had
his own individual book plate, with
private crest engraved on the binding,
so that the books belonging to the dif
ferent members and Ihe palace in which
they were placed can be easily dis
tinguished.
The books were placed on sale with
a dealer in New York by the Soviet
government. Van Patten also gathered
many examples of Communist news
papers, and the entire collection will
be placed on exhibition at the begin
ning of the fall quarter.
