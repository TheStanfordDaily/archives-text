# TEMPORARY PAVING AT PALM DRIVE ENTRANCE
## 
### 
The grading work that is now going
on at the entrance of Palm Drive is in
the way of an experiment, according
to R. H. Button, superintendent of
buildings and grounds.
The plan is to construct temporary
roads so that the drive may be split
into two traffic strips. Northbound
traffic would enter the north lane. If
this construction proves its worth over
a period of time, and if Comptroller A.
E. Roth approves when he returns from
his European visit, it is expected I hat
work of a more permanent nature will
be undertaken featuring a triangular
Howerbed to split the lanes. The Uni
versity will probably suggest a similar
plan to the Palo Alto council for the
opposite side of the highway, said
Button.
