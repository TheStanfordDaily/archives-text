### 
Peter Heiser, well-known football
star, will have the leading role in Eu
gene O'Neill's comedy of ancient and
modern life, "The Hairy Ape," which
will be presented here July 31, by
Harold Helvenston, director of dra
matics. This will be the first time a
three-act play by O'Neill has been pro
duced here, according to Helvenston.

"The Hairy Ape" is one of O'Neill's
later plays and represents some of his
finest experimental writing. It v/as first
produced in 1922 by the Provincetown
Players, who are widely known for
their thx-ee outstanding directors, Eu
gene O'Neill, Robert Edmond Jones,
and Kenneth Macgowan.

"The play has a very large cast,
about forty people," Helvenston said,
"and it will be done expressively rather
than realistically."
Lead a Hard-Boiled Part
Peter Heiser will take the part ori
ginated by the late Louis Wolheim. He
will play the hard-boiled, brutal, al
most primitive Robert Smith, known as
"Yank," the dominating and domineer
ing stoker on board an ocean liner.
Supporting Heiser are two other
stokers. Paddy, a wizened Irishman,
will be played by Carl Cartwiight, and
the part of Long, a cockney, will be
played by Herbert Jones. They will
have ample opportunity to display
their ability in these witty roles.
Stokers of various other nationalities,
injecting considerable comedy, will be
played by Robert Stephenson, John
Shidler, Kenneth Avery, George An
dreini, and Warren Biggs.
Catherine Crary will do the part of
Mildred Douglas, a passenger on the
ship, which is the most important
feminine role of the play. Miss Crary
has appeared many times on the Stan
ford stage. She probably is best re
membered as Mrs. Higgins in last sum
mer's production of George Bernard
Shaw's "Pygmalion."
Has Played in New York
Her aunt will be played by Dorothea
Johnston, an experienced actress, hav
ing played in New York the part of
Hermiona in "Winter's Tale" by
Shakespeare, which was directed by
Winthrop Ames and produced by Max
well Armfield. Miss Johnston also

and clubs throughout this country and
Europe in entertainment work.
