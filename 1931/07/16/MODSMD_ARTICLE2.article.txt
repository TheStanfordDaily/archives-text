Professor Augustus T. Murray of the
Classical Literature department will
make a short address of welcome this

more than 400 delegates to the Golden
Jubilee convention of International
Christian Endeavor Societies, which is
being held in San Francisco this week.
The delegates, who are guests of the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce this

seeing tour of the Stanford Campus and
Palo Alto by volunteer automobiles and
drivers. After the tour the guests will
be driven to the Mayfield station where
they will board electric cars to be

Santa Clara Valley.
