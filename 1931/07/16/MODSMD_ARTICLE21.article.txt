# FRIENDLY RIVALS
## 
### 
A foreign visitor on the campus this week, hearing that there
is in session here a school for chamber of commerce secretaries,
would find it a little dillicult to understand this distinctly
American enterprise. lie would he told that the secretaries are
the paid ollicials of their organizations, 'which exist for the
purpose of advancing the welfare of their own towns or cities.
He would he told further that not least among the functions of
chambers of commerce is that of devising ways and means of
attracting visitors, residents, and industries to their communi
ties. The visitor would see at once, of course, that such is an.
intensely competitive activity in which city vies against city,
and even state against state.

If that struck the visitor us being unusual, he would he still
more amazed to discover that the men gathered at this meeting
represented chambers from cities in the far western part of the
Unitd States, and that at least a part of their school work
would have to do with discovering better techniques of build
ing up their cities. That is, these rivals are co-operating to find
ways to compete with each other. The secretary from Excelsior
and the secretary from Zenith will learn at this school how to
attract large industrial plants to their respective communities.
Then they will go back to the chambers of commerce they repre
sent and at once struggle against each other when they learn
that the Zippv Automobile Company is planning to build a
plant on the Pacific coast.
To the foreigner who believes that America is a stronghold
of individual and group competition, such a meeting as this
Secretaries School will be hard to understand. And yet he will
soon find that such things are typical of this land of ours, for
not a great deal different in actual practice are the many service
clubs, composed of competing business men in a community,
that abound throughout the land.
Although such things may seem to be a form of hypocrisy,
unconscious hypocrisy, perhaps, they can hardly be so stigma
tized. For out of these meetings of apparent rivals there does
emerge a spirit of friendship and co-operation that'cannot be
dismissed with a cynical laugh. Through these mediums the old
"laissez faire" doctrine is evolving into a form of co-operation.
And the full co-operation, when il does evolve, will be more
effective than il would be if il were imposed by some superior
power.
