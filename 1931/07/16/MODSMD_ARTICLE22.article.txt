# THE 						SHAME OF CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Three members of the Communist pnrtv spoke before a
gathering in Los Angeles Hie other night. As a consequence they
were arrested on suspicion of criminal syndicalism. No special
news in that. It's happened before, \i is not novel.
Rut Los Angeles, even though it may be ever eager to enforce
the criminal syndicalism act, cannot be blamed for tin's most
shameful piece of California's legislation; that a law forbidding
citizens of the United States to express doubt that ours is in
every respect the best of ail possible governments should be al
lowed to remain on the statute books of Ibis stale is the shame
of the whole of California.
Passed by the state legislature in 11)10, in the midst of the
period of post-war hysteria when anything lliat questioned any
item of the government that had made the world safe for
democracy aroused exaggerated apprehensions, it was intended
to combat an evil which even then was more fancied than real.
Today il has no excuse for existence. Freedom of speech is
one of man's inalienable rights—certainly a right to be most
jealously safeguarded in a republic in which the people arc
rulers—and the Communist party is recognized as one of Ihc
political organizations of Ihc nation. Any act which prohibits
freedom of speech and makes il possible for men to be sent to
prison for mere membership in an organization sanctioned by
Ihc national government is dangerous—in spirit if not in body
unconstitutional.
In April of this year Ohio's criminal syndicalism law was
declared unconstitutional. How long, California?
