# A 						LITTLE SOMETHING MIGHT LEAK IN

In his welcoming address in the official publication of the
Western School for Commercial Secretaries, which is now hav
ing its eleventh session on the campus, Business Manager Leon
ard E. Head said:
"Class attendance last year was very gratifying. Well-at
tended classes inspire our instructors, put pep into the dis
cussions, and keep up the morale of the school. In a word,
your attendance at the classes insures a maximum return in
training for your secretarial work. Certificates of attendance
will he awarded only to those attending 80 per cent or more of
the classes."
Stanford students have always been discussing the relative
merits and demerits of the present examination and grading
system in use here, and now the commercial secretaries seem to
have advanced a good solution for the problem. Degrees could
lie awarded on a basis of attendance and not on the present
system of grades. With the system of NO per cent class attend
ance in effect, the students would be allowed one cut a week in
a live-unit course.
The Western School for Commercial Secretaries believes
that its students can get more out of classes where attendance
counts over grades, than where grades are the sole and deciding
factor. The school should adopt as its motto, "It is better to
train a sleeping student in class, than to train no student at all."
