A FREE SOUL—At the New Stanford.
Her own father advises her to live
her life as she wants to live it, follow
ing the racy beckoning of her own
heart with uttter disregard lor social
consequences. She does just this and
finds to her misfortune that conse
quences have to be reckoned with.
Norma Shearer, as her father's
daughter and possessor of a "free soul"
turns in another splendid characteriza
tion of one of our gay young moderns.
However, she does look a bit tired in
the close-ups and a portion, small to
be sure, of the sparkle that has stood
out in her other pictures, is missing.
Lionel Barrymore as the father is good,
and Leslie Howard as the "lover in
spite of everything" pleases, but Clarke
Gable doesn't appeal as the gangster.
THE MIKADO—At the Tivoli.
Produced under the direction of
Reginald Travel's, a revival of the
popular Gilbert and Sullivan satire on
Japanese politics with De Wolf Hopper
in the role of the Lord High Execu
tioner is delighting audiences of elderly
people who saw it when it was new
and young people who are making its
acquaintance for the first time. A sur
vey of the audience during any per
formance reveals lovers of Gilbert and
Sullivan nodding to the rhythm, lean
ing forward to catch every word of the
catchy songs, and smiling, even guf
fawing, at the antics of the Lord High
Executioner.
De Wolf Hopper, at 73, is the most
active member of the cast. His rendi
tion of "Taken from the County Jail,"
"I've Got Them on the List," and
"Flowers that Bloom in the Spring,"
calls forth as many encores as the Lord
High Executioner will permit.
Miss Lillian Glaser is an attractive
Yum-Yum, and her lover is well played
by Arthur Johnson. The Mikado, him
self, is Carl Kroenke, who delighted
audiences as Sir Joseph Porter in
"Pinpfore" a few weeks ago, and repre
sents the pompous Mikado in a de
lightful manner, his rendition of "Let
Punishment Fit the Crime" calling
forth much paplause.
"Tit-Willow," sung by Ko-Ko, is one
of the most amusing bits, but no one
song should be singled out iti a two
and-a-half-hour session of fun.
PARTY HUSBAND, also MONSTERS
OF THE DEEP—At the Varsity.
Dorothy Mackaill as a modern wife
is well cast in "Party Husband" and
gives a convincing performance. Donald
Cooke, who plays opposite her as the
modern husband, gets away with his
part well without bidding for a place
in the hall of fame. Sophisticated mar
riage wherein both the man and the
woman try to maintain their own "in
dividuality" is exploded in a perform
ance which you will probably like but
won't remember. The producers are
to be commended for avoiding the
usual cinema "super-sophisticates,"
whose over-acting has ruined many
pictures.
"Monsters of the Deep" is an inter
esting but tedious travelogue wherein
commercial tuna fishing, whaling, and
shark-catching oil the Mexican coast
are portrayed. In short—hte joys of
deep-sea fishing without the smells.
