A1 Capone is said to be insolvent.
Discovered when drinking some of his
own liquor, no doubt.

He had waited a long time for a ride,
When the new Ford coupe came to a
stop in front of him, he had opened
the door before the squeak of the
brakes died out. While but half inside
the car he was halted. "Just a mo
ment." The driver spread a paper on
the seat. Two thicknesses. He who
sought the ride rearranged it. One
thickness. A fierce look from the driver.
Moral: Have your cords cleaned every
quarter.
Palo Alto policemen are expected by
residents to stop dogs from biting, bees
from stinging, roosters from crowing,
ducks from quacking. Isn't it carrying
things beyond reason to expect them
also to stop criminals from criming?
A true college comedy was enacted
the other night under the foliage of
that rather drooping tree by the Sta
dium. As the campus cop tells it, he
was on his usual midnight prowl here
and there in the line of duty when he
espied a parked car in the shadows of
the tree. The Law flashed his spotlight
and waited. Finally a voice said petu
lantly: "Well, come on in; there's room
enough for two of us."
The University of California football
squad can't get into action, according
to the conference rule, for a couple of
months yet, but Brick Morse has begun
to win the varsity's' games for it al
ready in his newspaper column.
Palo Alto garbage collectors have
been put into brown duck uniforms
with numbers on them. Nifty idea lor
a college town. The garbage varsity
will use the shift—eight hours to a
shift.
Publicity man of the Los Angeles
chamber of commerce is quoted as cit

Commercial Secretaries School. Maybe

to be what it is.
