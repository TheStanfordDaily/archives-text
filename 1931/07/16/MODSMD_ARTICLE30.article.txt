# PAGANISM'S DECLINE TOPIC OF GREGOIRE'S WEDNESDAY LECTURE
## Theodosius I Gave Death Blow To Sacrificial Ceremonies 
### 
The destruction of paganism was the ;
subject of the lecture in French given
yesterday by Professor Henri Grdlgoire j
of the University of Brussels, who is
giving a series of Wednesday afternoon
lectures on Byzantine culture and
civilization.
The lecture yesterday dealt with
studies of the different edicts of perse
cution against the pagans which suc
ceeded the edicts of toleration, in the
fourth century A.D. Professor Gregoire
told of Sonstantious, the son of Con-
Stuntine, who is supposed to have pro
hibited pagan sacrifices, and he showed
that this belief is not true; that sacri
fices were really going on under his
reign, and that an official sacrifice was
offered in Rome in 359 by the prefect of
the city, in order to appease the tem
pest by which the arrival of supplies
from Africa was delayed. Private sacri
fices were forbidden for the reason that
they might include inspection of the
victims after the sacrifice and thereby
thd successor to the emperor might be
predicted.
According to Professor Gregoire, af
ter the failure in 3615 of Julian, who
had brought about a revival of pagan
ism, toleration prevailed for a while,
but a strong pagan revival is noticeable
at the end of the fourth century. The
real death blow to paganism came, the
lecturer said, when in 392 Theodosius I
issued an edict forbidding every kind
(if pagan ceremony.
Professor Grqgoire, taking an exam
ple, showed by analysis of the "Life
of Porphyry, Bishop of Gaza," how the
Christians, bishops, and emperors, at
the end of the fourth century and the
beginning of the fifth century, suc
ceeded in converting en masse the still
numerous pagans.
Reform, persecution, and toleration
were the keynote of Professor Gre
goire's first lecture of this series, and
from, toleration to persecution was the
sad burden of this lecture, a new chap
ter of religious history.
The next of the series will be on the
beauty contests at the Byzantine court,
according to Professor Gregoire, who
added that beauty contests were a com
mon method of selecting the empresses.
