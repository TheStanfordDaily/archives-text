# SPECIALLY TRAINED APPLICANTS MOST APT TO BE PLACED SAYS APPOINTMENT OFFICE

' The man who wants to do just any
thing hasn't a chance this year," de
clared Miss Ruth Tracksell, who is in
charge of the Appointment Service at
Stanford. "Experience has shown that
the men who are placed are those who
know very definitely what they want
to do."
The Appointment Service, with the
co-operation of the Vocational Guid
ance Committee, places a great many
men and women in positions in almost
every line of work for which a college
prepares them. Requests come to the
bureau for engineers of all kinds, for
physicists, chemists, commercial artists,
accountants, secretaries, and those'
trained to do advertising work.
Calls come from large companies that
have trained forces of college gradu
ates, it was pointed out, and they want
people who are fitted for exceptional
positions. According to Miss Tracksell,
there are not enough experienced men
registered to fill all the calls which
demand experience. If the students
would keep the bureau informed of their
whereabouts and their preferences for
work something is certain to come up.
Permanent Records Kept
Besides these miscellaneous positions
are numerous teaching and adminis
trative positions, which are constantly
filled from qualified candidates in the
files. Permanent, confidential records
are kept in the appointment office, rec
ords which are never destroyed and arc
always kept up to date. These records
include personal recommendations as
well as information of a more per
manent nature.

"If a teacher will send in all informa
tion about himself that is of interest to
the bureau, he may be sure," declared
Miss Tracksell, "that the office will
never lose track of him or neglect his
interests..
"Now that personal references carried
around in one's pocket and presented
personally to prospective employers are
in discredit, it is necessary for a teach
er, if he or she wants to obtain any
kind of position, to have records on
file in a university appointment bu
reau."
Applications Are Not Buried
Applications on file are not buried
alphabetically, but they are kept ac
cording to the type of work the appli
cant wants to do. If he is uncertain,
C. G. Wrenn, who is the secretary of
the Vocational Guidance Committee,
refers any student who wants sugges
tions and aid to various members of
the committee, or to alumni who have
volunteered their assistance, or to peo
ple in San Francisco who are qualified
to give information in the line the
student wants to follow. Wrenn also
gives vocational interest tests to those
who want them.

Miss Tracksell's advice is that it is
wise for students who want positions
after graduation to register early with
the appointment office, for a greater
assurance of a position can thus be se
cured. She further urges that, having
once registered, a student co-operate
with the bureau in keeping the records
current, for in this way only can full
justice be done the employers and ap
plicants both.
