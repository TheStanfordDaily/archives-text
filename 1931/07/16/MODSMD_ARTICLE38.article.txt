# WATER IN POOLS AT ENCINA PURE ENOUGH TO DRINK SAYS BROWN
## Laboratory Tests Show That Bacterium Content Is Below Normal 
### 
That the clear blue water in the
swimming pools at Encina gym, in
which hundreds of male students cavort
every day, is even more pure than
campus drinking water, was the state
ment made today by Walter H. Brown,
director of the University health ser
vice. "Laboratory analyses are made
each week to determine the sanitary
quality of the water, and these exam
inations show that it confirms to the
United States Treasury Department
standards for drinking water," declared
Dr. Brown.
The pools are filled after each empty- !
ing with water pumped from deep wells
located on the Board of Athletic Con
trol property. Taking approximately 8
hours for one complete turnover, steri
lization is accomplished by circulating
the water daily through sand and
gravel filters which remove any sus
pended matter and a large portion of
the bacteria. Tests have never shown
more than 20 bacteria per cubic centi
meter of water.
After filtration, the water is heated
by means of steam, and during the win
ter it is kept at a temperature of 72
degrees. Following the filtering and
heating processes a minute quantity of
chlorine gas is introduced which kills
any remaining bacteria, and any
heavier foreign matter that remains
after the purifying process is removed
by vacuum suction sweepers which
operate on the same principle as the
ordinary vacuum cleanex*.
