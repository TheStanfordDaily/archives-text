# JOLLY-UP CALLS FOR ENCORE; CROWD LARGE
## 
### 
A Jolly-Up that proved so successful
as to call for a short continuation of the
usual seven-to-eight program, was held
on Wednesday night in Roble Hall.
Virginia Chamberlain and Annie-
Pauline Moore of Roble directed the
party, with the assistance of a com
mittee of five men from Toyon Hall.
Several hundred attended the affair.
