# ENFORCEMENT OF DRY LAW MAY BE IGNORED BELIEVES PROF. GLENN
## Anglo-Saxons Have Always Glorified Law-Breaker Asserts Virginian

"Man's moral fibre is just as good
today as it has been at any time in
the history of mankind," says Garrard
Glenn, acting professor of law from the
University of Vii-ginia. Before joining
the faculty at Virginia in 1929, Profes
sor Glenn practiced law in New York
City for twenty-five years.
Glenn believes that crime has al
ways been glorified in the public eye
even though there always has been a
movement to abolish crime. Especially
is this true of the Anglo-Saxons, he
says. Today the newspapers, magazines,
and movies play up the racketeer and
gangster. In England in the 18th cen
tury the popular writings were of gen
tleman highwaymen. At this 'same
period in Spain the popular imagina
tion was focused on the returned sol
dier who, unable to settle down, be
came a wandering rogue.
Gangster Heroes on Wane
"What type of crime will be deified
tomorrow is impossible to say; but in
view of the past, there will be a switch
from the gangster type of hero," says
the Virginian.
"It is my hope that the 18th Amend
ment to our Constitution may be modi
fied or abolished; but if such ever oc
curs, it will not be in a' direct and
logical process such as was carried on
in Canada when they returned to the
legal usage of liquors."
According to Glenn the probable
course of events in the modification or
abolishment will be one of forgetting
or leaving sleeping dogs lie as has been
the case with the amendments dealing
with the Negro. "Here, as with the
18th Amendment, the great difficulty
of changing or abolishing produces a
situation in which the law still remains
upon the statute books; but for all
practical purposes it is abolished as it
is no longer enforced," he says.
Prohibition Fathers Hypocrisy
"Prohibition raises new forms of
hypocrisy and diverts revenue, that be
fore prohibition flowed into the public
treasures, into other channels."
When asked about the effect of pro
hibition upon the life of the masses in
the United States, Glenn said: "It is
logical to test home life by the amount
of crime. We, here in America, have
more crime than ever before and our
prisons are filled to overcrowdingâ€”a
situation which leads to convict riots.
However, in England where there is no
prohibition law, and where the laws
are enforced as good, if not better, than
here, there is less crime. England has
sold at least two prisons within the
last few years on account of lack of
criminals to confine in them."
