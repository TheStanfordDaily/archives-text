# LICK OBSERVATORY TO BE DESTINATION OF WEEK END EXCURSION
## 
### 
Lick Observatory on Mount Hamil
ton is the destination of the excursion
offered next Saturday by the Summer
Quarter administration in co-operation
with a Palo Alto taxi company.

The Observatory is the astronomy
department of the University of Cali
fornia, and is situated on Mount Ham
ilton, 26 miles from San Jose, at an
altitude of 4209 feet. The site was cho
sen for the steady and transparent
quality of the atmosphere, and is one
of the first to be chosen for its adapta
tion to astronomical work. The 36-inch
refracting telescope used there is the
second largest refracting telescope in
the world.

Besides the large telescope, there are
other smaller ones in use in the build
ings on the mountain. James Lick, who
gave the money for the observatory, is
buried under one of the supporting
pillars of the telescope.

The route which will be taken on
Saturday is through San Jose and up
the road which winds its way from the
Santa Clara Valley to the summit.
There are said to be 365 curves in the
road between Smith's Creek and the
top. From it can be seen the valley, the
view being unobstructed by foliage
near the road.

Cars will leave the Union at 4 o'clock
in the afternoon, and will return about
midnight. Those who intend to go may
make reservations at the office of the
Dean of the Summer Quarter in the
Administration Building by leaving the
fare of three dollars. Supper should be
brought by each member of the party,
since there is no place where it can bo
purchased on Mount Hamilton.
