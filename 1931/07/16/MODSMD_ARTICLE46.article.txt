# RAP HONOR STUDENTS IN DIPLOMA MARKINGS

### 
That "cum laude" or even "magna"
or "â€¢surama cum laude" indicates by its
appearance on one's diploma high cul
tural ranking would seem to be dis
proved by the results of a test applied (
to senior students at the University of
Minnesota.
Dr. J. B. Johnston, dean of the Col
lege of Science, Literature, and the
Arts, reveals that seven of the seniors
who were graduated with honors were
in the lower half of the class in the
"cultural examination," and that one

of the seniors who was awarded a
"cum laude" received a percentile
ranking of only 16 in the test. Further
more, the results of the test, which
have been analyzed by Donald Pater
son, professor of psychology, showed
that five seniors, who could not gradu
ate with honors because they had not
the required 2.00 honor point average,
had test rankings higher than the ma
jority of those receiving "magna" or
"summa cum laude."
