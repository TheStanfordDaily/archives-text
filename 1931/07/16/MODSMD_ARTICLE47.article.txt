# STANFORD AUTHORS WELL REPRESENTED IN TEXTBOOK SHOW
## Publishers Making Annual Display Of School Material

Some two dozen publishers from all
parts of the country are displaying
books in the Annual Textbook Exhibit
held in room 300 of the Engineering
department. For the most part the
books are textbooks for elementary,
high-school, and eollege students. The
bindings are different from the usual
run of school books, some of them
leaning toward modernity in design.

Several books by Stanford people
are featured in the exhibit. Books writ
ten by faculty members include the
following: a book on history and eco
nomics by E. M. Hulme, professor of
history; the Hispanic Series by Aurelio
M. Espinosa, professor of Spanish; Vir
gil's "Aeneid" by H. P. Fairclough,
professor of classical literature, emeri

Lewis M. Terman, head of the psych
ology department; and "Education for
Junior Colleges" by Elwood P. Cubber
ley, which was just recently received
and added to the display.

books on display are Edith Mirrielees,

Alice Cooper, co-author of "Adventures
in Literature."
