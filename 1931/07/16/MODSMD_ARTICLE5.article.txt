# Napoleon Popular Idol of French Says Higby
## Legends Perpetuate Memory Of "Little General" 
### 
"Napoleon gave the French Nation
the most glory she has ever known,
and won for himself an heroic hold on
the hearts of his peolle," declared Pro
fessor Chester P. Higby, acting profes
sor of history from the University of
Wisconsin, who lectured on Napoleon,
in the Little Theatre, Tuesday evening.
"The memory and emotion of the
French people were quickly fired by
the personal magnetism of 'The Little
General' upon his return from banish
ment on the Island of Elba," Higby
said. "Landing at Cannes on March 1,
1815, with only 400 of his old guard,
thousands of French soldiers flocked to
join him as he marched to oust the
despotic House of Bourbon. Without
firing a gun or shedding a drop of
blood, Napoleon re-established himself
in Paris.
Nationalism Proved a Boomerang
"But this second period of Napoleonic
supremacy, known as the 'Hundred
Days,' was, like his dictatorship, des
tined to fall by the boomerang of na
tionalism, the spirit of which he had so
successfully inspired in his earlier days
of leadership. A rapid reactionary
growth in the oppressed European
countries, during his exile at Elba, now
presented formidable armed fronts on
all sides"â€”and then came Waterloo.
Professor Higby told of the over
throw of the monarchy in the Revolu
tion of 1792, the corruptness and mis
management of the Directorate which
followed, and finally the establishment
of the Republic in 1799 with Napoleon
as First Consul.
Napoleon's Appearance Timely
Napoleon's timely appearance in
France, fresh from his successful Battle
of the Pyramids in Egypt, and his mili
tary prominence in the campaigns of
1792, were said by Professor Higby to
have been largely responsible for his
selection as First Consul for ten yeaxs
with virtually supreme power's. This
coup d' etat was not especially notable,
but his subsequent work was remark
able.
"France had been warring since 1792
and welcomed the 15 months of abso
lute peace brought by the new Dic
tatorship," said Professor Higby.
Among the most notable achievements,
Were mentioned: 1. Re-centralization of
the administration functions for more
efficiency, 2. A concordat with the
church, which brought religious toler
ance and satisfaction, 3. Revision of
an unwieldy system of laws, and 4.
Creation of many new administrative
offices through expansion of national
boundaries.
His Protective Tariff Resented
"It was foreign resentment against
the stringent protective tariff erected
by Napoleon within his ever-growing
country, as well as his territorial ag
grandizement which eventually led to
the downfall of his dictatorship.
"After Napoleon's disastrous retreat
from Moscow, an avalanche of upris
ings caused his banishment to Elba
and after his unsuccessful return thir
teen months later, to his permanent
exile on the island of St. Helena in
1815.
"Due to the immortal power of mem
ory and emotion, a host of glorious
Napoleonic legends, originating during
the last years of his life on St. Helena,
still possess the imagination of his
people and mark him as the great na
tional idol of France," the speaker con
cluded.
