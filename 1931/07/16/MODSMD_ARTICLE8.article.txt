# STUNT PUBLICITY FEATURES SCHOOL GROUP BARBECUE
## Commerce Secretaries Have Variety In Outing 
### 
Boosting, baseball, and barbecue
were the order of the Wednesday pro
gram of the Western School for Com
mercial Secretaries, who are meeting
in the eleventh annual session on the
Stanford campus.
Citing the case of Aimee MePherson
as an illustration of stunt publicity,
Bruce A. Findlay of Los Angeles em
phasized the desirability of capitalizing
on unfortunate but inevitable disasters
as a means of boosting. Findlay, who
is manager of the exploitation and pub
lic relations department, Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce, said:
"Be on your toes to get stunt pub
licity whether the laugh is on you or
not. Aimee MePherson has been on
the front page of more newspapers
more times than any other individual
in the United States."
Municipal Ownership Discussed
James W. Spangler, of the Dexter
Horton Bank in Seattle, referred to the
recent recall of the mayor of that city
in his talk on "Economic Freedom."
The fact that municipal ownership is
very often detrimental and unremu
nerative was pointed out by Spangler,
and the recall of the mayor was a re
sult of the fight between his' backers
and the political machine of the former
power system head.
"Public ownership is purely political
and is not economic, being the short
sighted policy of an active minority
without capital at stake," said Spangler.
Other speakers at yesterday's session
were W. C. Culkins, Ohio Valley Im
provement Association; R. W. Knight,
of Boeing Companies, and Ralph Brad
ford, of the United States chamber.
Luncheon guest speakers were Fred
erick J. Koster of the California cham
ber and Philip Fay of the United States
chamber.
"Cal" vs. "World"â€”Baseball
"California" against the "World
Champs" was the baseball atraction at
the old polo field yesterday afternoon
when the secretaries took their places
on the diamond. A barbecue, under the
direction of Sam McDonald, completed
the day's program. Tuesday night a
"high-jinks" was held, featuring hu
morous skits and entertainment.
Eighteen new members registered
Tuesday and three more enrolled yes
terday at Branner Hall. This brings
the total far above that of other years.
