EL CAMPO GETS NEW FLOOR
El Campo's eating quarters are being
refioored with cement. Dry rot, com
mon to some buildings in this district,
is responsible for the new floor. El j
Campo is situated in a low spot and the !
collection of rainwater under the ;
foundations is said to have aggravated
the condition. El Toro Club, adjoining,
had a wood floor installed five years i
ago. The group of clubs, El Campo, El j
Toro, and Breakers, were built in 1912.
