# MORATORIUM IS HOPE OF GERMAN CRISIS SOLUTION
## American Plan Will Save Europe From Internal Strife, Says Lutz Declares Spread of Fascism Is Danger to Germany's Best Interests 
### 
"With the present eeonomie crisis in
Germany, which constitutes the most
serious problem faced by Europe since
the war, and with the ultimate solution
not yet apparent, it seems certain that
the American movement in favor of a
moratorium will in the end save Eu
rope from what otherwise would have
been a revolutionary and an interna
tional explosion" was the opinion voiced
by Professor R. H. Lutz of the history
department in an interview yesterday.
"Germany's economic situation is
even more serious than the one which
arose as a climax to the post-war infla
tion of 1924. As early as last spring it
was obvious that she could not continue
her schedule of reparation payments,"
continued Lutz, who returned from
Germany just before the crisis de
veloped.
Moratorium Is Solution
"The reparations situation will be
solved by President Hoover's mora
torium," believes Professor Lutz, "but
the far-reaching effects of this pro
posal will not be felt for a year or so
because it seems probable that Ger
many's reparations will have to be
modified ultimately. Recent deci
sions of the London Conference will
probably solve the present financial
problem. The economic crisis, however,
was not caused only by the heavy
reparations and the interests of the
industrial and state bond issues that
were held abroad, but by the internal
financial demands of the last three
budgets."
Germany Confronts Disorder
"As evidenced by the political de
mands of France in connection with
proposed foreign loans, the German
Government is confronted with politi
cal as well as economic disorder," it
was pointed out by Professor Lutz.
"The growing strength of the National
Socialist Party since the first of the
year has created this political develop
ment, and a further development of
parties to the right will undoubtedly
lead to the fall of the existing govern
ment. The danger does not lie in the
possible control by the Bolsheviki, but
in the spread of Faccism," is the opinion
of Lutz. 'As a result of the economic
destruction, the middle class has dis
appeared and Germany now has a new
proletariat with the idealogy of the
bourgeoisie, and this group forms the
shock troops of the Hilton movement.
However, if the present German gov
ernment weathers this financial storm,"
concluded Professor Lutz, "it is reason
able to predict that they will be sus
tained by the electorate in the next
national election."
