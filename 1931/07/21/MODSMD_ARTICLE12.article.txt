# PLAY THE HAIRY APE' IS CHARACTERISTIC OF REAL O'NEILL DRAMA
## "Yank" Brutal And Primitive Stoker Is Leader Of Large Cast 
### 
I In Eugene O'Neill's play, "The Hairy
Ape," which will be presented in the
; Assembly Hall on July 31, there is no
I romance or sentimentality for those
j who demand those elements in their
; drama. It is a tragically grand play,
i nakedly real, and full of introspection
| and speculation ,and is almost brutally
j ehiotional. Like the more familiar
| "Emperor Jones," it is play of the
I grimmest, most uncompromising stark
! realism. However, the characters never
I are out of touch with something that is
! beyond reality, though they are faith
i ful to the last.
Though the surface plots and char
| acters of O'Neill's plays are in them
| selves often ugly and repellent, they
! serve to indicate and suggest the great
! beauty that always lies in the depths of
I the great dramatist's work, a continu
[ ally underflowing beauty. "Yank," the
i brutal, rather primitive lord over the
stokers on an ocean liner, is ugly, and
his stoke-hole kingdom is ugly, but a
poignant beauty lies in the situation
jas O'Neill conceives it, a beauty of
elemental emotion.
O'Neill is universally recognized as
I the only American dramatist who can
j compete with the best British and Con-
I tinental outward expression of the age
! in which he lives; "he is the poet
| chronicler of its inward forces."
"The Hairy Ape" is a show of many
scenes, and has the largest cast that
has been used in a legitimate play on
| the campus for a great many years,
I excluding musical shows, which re
! quire large numbers of people.
Additional actors chosen by Harold
Helvenston, director, for the fifth scene
include: Martha Alexander, June
Birchard, Jacqueline DeWit, Mary
, Purdy, Irene Goldenberg, Marion Lit
; tlefield, Mable Pruitt, William Mahu,
Jack Pettker, El bridge Rector, and Jo
! seph Whitaker. William Ring will play
one of the stokers. Â»
