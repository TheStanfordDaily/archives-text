# LONESOME LETTERS OF LOVELY LADIES REACH LOCAL LADS
## 
### 
WINSOME waitresses, melau
" choly milkmaids, and doubtful
farmers' daughters from Podunk,
Mil pi tali, Toonerville, and way
points throughout Wyoming, Colo
rado, and Utah are all writing
letters to local "roughs" living in
Toyon Hall. These notes contain
pictures of the fair writers and
proposals' of marriage, platonic
fricndships, and a variety of re
lationships both honorable and
otherwise.
The sudden popularity of the
Toyon residents, for long a mys
tery, was explained yesterday
when a former fellow student of
the hall boys wrote telling them
he was proving himself "just a
pal" in spreading their names and
address with various testimonials
as to their good looks, physical
attainments, and financial fitness
throughout the small towns in the
Middle West. It is understood that
the wandering student is in pos
session of a summer quarter
"bawlout."
