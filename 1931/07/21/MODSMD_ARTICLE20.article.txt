# OLYMPIC TRIALS MAY BE RUN ON STANFORD TRACK
## A.A.U. Proposal Names Card Field For Final Trials, Maloney Confident Brundage, President National Committee, In Favor Of Local Grounds 
### 
The bringing of the Olympic Games
trials to Stanford University was the
purpose of a meeting held by the
American Athletic Union last Thurs-
I day evening in San Francisco. At the
• close of the meeting, a communication
' was sent to Avery Brundage, president
1 of the American Olympic Games Asso
ciation in Chicago, requesting him to
| urge the American Track and Field
I Committee to have the final trials held
j on the Stanford campus.
The AA.U. conference was attended
by Bill Monahan, graduate manager of
1 California; Bill Coffman, president of
the A.A.U.; A1 Masters, graduate man
ager of Stanford; Sam Goodman, mem
-1 ber of the Olympic Track and Field
Committee; and Harry Maloney, direc
! tor of minor and intramural sports at
| Stanford, and member of the Olympic
j Games Committee.
"The AA.U. communication that was
sent to Chicago," according to Maloney,
"stressed the location of Stanford; its
j easy accessibility by rail, road, and
water; and the complete athletic facili
ties that are available."
Maloney Is Optimistic
"When the American Track and Field
Committee becomes familiar with the
wonderful athletic plant that we have
at Stanford," said Maloney, "I am .sure
that the final trials will be held here.
We have the population around the bay
region to support such a meet; the
! campus is open to all methods of travel;
1 and either Toyon or Branner hall will
be open to the visiting athletes during
| the summer trials."
President Brundage stated that as far
; as he was concerned, he was in favor
of holding the trials at Stanford, but
| that the American Track and Field
Committee would have the final deci
j sion on the matter. «
Los Angeles Refuses Award
Last May at a meeting held in Chi
cago, the American Track and Field
Committee awarded the final trials to
I Los Angeles. When the delegate from
j Los Angeles returned home and handed
, in his report on the meeting, President
I William Garland of the Olympic
Organization Committee decided that it
■ was inadvisable to hold the trials on
! the new track in Los Angeles two
; weeks before the opening of the
Olympic Games.
Garland believes that the trials would
! put the track in a poor condition for
. the games, and that it is riot fair to the
foreign athletes to allow the American
I contestants to hold their tryouls on the
I same field on which the games will be
! held.
The Los Angeles delegates suggested
that since the trials would not be held
! in the South, and that Stanford had
applied for them, they would use their
J influence to have the final trials held
, here.
