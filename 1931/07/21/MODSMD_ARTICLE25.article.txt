# COPS AND COPS

### 
Prominent among 1 lie multitude of hv-produets of the auto-1
mobile industry is the motor cop. This particular group of law
guardians may be classified into Kvo cliques. The smaller, more j
deadly clan is composed of those overbearing ollicious creatures j
who wax fat upon the discomfiture of the erring motorist. So
far there has been no set name coined to designate this type;
however the vocabulary of every driver contains a few juicy j
phrases which are excellent in descriptive power.
The other clique is made up of "good eggs." A "good egg" is
a rather pleasant fellow who remains a rather pleasant fellow
even though he hands us a ticket. And those of us who have had
contact with our "campus cops" must realize that we are very
fortunate in that they belong without exception to the latter
class.
Perhaps straws are drawn in the selection of these ollieers;
in such a case we are lucky. Perhaps the Administration gives ;
them a strict "good-fellowship" examination; in this case the
Administration knows its business. Hut in either case we should
pause to congratulate ourselves, for rare indeed are laments on
unfairness in receiving a ticket on the Stanford campus, and j
non-existent are reports of anv unnecessary abuse of any kind. |
