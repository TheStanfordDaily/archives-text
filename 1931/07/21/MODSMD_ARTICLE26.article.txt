# GOOD RIDDANCE
## 
### 
Cigarette butts which were scattered along the arcade by j
the engineering corner have been swept up. Hooks of various
tirins have been removed from room 300 and are on their way
back to the publishers.
And the ten or twelve penny-pitching salesmen who were re
sponsible for the cigarettes have left the campus, leaving behind
them naught but tinv scars on the sides of the buildings against
which they tossed their pennies, and memories with a rather |
unpleasant odor.
Cigarette ends can be swept up. Hut memories of men who:
had not enough courtesy to show, if they did not feel, respect
for a custom of the institution which was their host, that of not
smoking on the Quad; who spent most of their time hanging!
around outside the exhibit like loafers bv a corner drug store,
when vou desired to be shown the books inside, will not be
-
eradicated, even by the oft-mentioned ravages of lime. And no
love for publishers who employed such boors will be fostered by
those memories.
It would seem that publishing houses which desire to pro
mote good-will by such ;in exhibit could employ men who had
at least a thicker veneer of courtesy over their natural ill man
ners. And Stanford would enjoy it much more if they should.
