# VALUES AND WORKING STUDENTS

### 
The self-supporting student is denied many tilings in college;
yet where he loses he sometimes gains.
He may not have time or money for full social or athletic
activities. Hut in this lie learns something of the real values of
time and money, knowledge which many persons never quite I
fully acquire.
His scales of college life are balances of dollars and hours.
Six hours may equal three dollars, or perhaps a reading assign
ment. The three dollars may mean a new shirt or a "date."
New shirts and dates are rather infrequent, and so he must get
the best possible for his time and money.
Maybe he miscalculates and decides to forego the date; not
in every instance is the new shirt or six hours of study the wiser
investment.
This constant balancing of time against money is in many
ways as valuable preparation for post-graduation life as is
college life proper. It makes for ellieiency and higher quality
of work. And it can contribute much of poise and character.
The student who successfully supports himself throughout
his college years is likely to be a man who is at a premium any
where.
