Teachers seizing time to continue university study during I lie
summer were warned the other day by Dean Arthur 11. Wilde
of the Boston I'niversitv school of education not to go at it too
furiously, lie urged them to take rest periods during the week.
The value of summer study by teachers, he said, is un
doubted. "The question is raised, however," he said, "whether
the rush for knowledge gives enough chance for proper mental
assimilation of new material. With tins in mind, let me urge j
upon you the necessity for giving yourselves an opportunity at
some time during each week to relax from your intensive work.
Such rest periods will give you ii chance to organize mentally, to
relied upon the work at hand, and adjust it to proper relation
ship to its setting."
I here is a sound idea there. Xwt that students are likely to
study too hard even school teachers taking summer work with
serious and definite objective but Hint some students are likely
to forget that mere cramming in of information doesn't educate.
I*acts iu themselves are not educative. Over-earnest but unwise
students sometimes forget this in their eagerness to accomplish!
as much as possible in a brief time. It is only when new facts
are fitted in with information and convictions already part of llie
intellectual equipment, that they become a part of an education.
It's the old story that education is a development from within
and not something that is poured in from the outside.
