SMART MONEY—At llic New Clan
ford Theatre.
I
A lucky, but strictly honest, small- j
(own gambler "outgrows" his locality
and decides to try the game on a
larger scale. With a fat stake given 1
him by local backers he heads for the j
big city. A ring of sharpers take his
whole roll the first evening that he ;
"sits iu." Instead of weeping on some
one's shoulder, he hustles about, gels
more backers, and plays the crooked
crowd at their own game -and wins.
From then on it is easy sledding for
him and he fin.illy mounts the gambling
throne of the city. One of his weak
nesses (blondes) betrays him to the
D.A.'s office and the story ends with
his starting on a ten-year run in the
Big House.
Edward G. Robinson, as Nick the |
gambler, males the show excellent en- 1
tertainment all by himself. His manner
of speech and the way in winch he
holds a cigar are good. Evelyn Knapp, ,
Noel Francis, and James Cagney are !
also in the cast.

TRANSGRESSION—A< I lie California
Theatre, Mayfield.

The story of an absent husband and
a tempted wife. The "transgression"
amounts to a stolen kiss or two. Kay
Francis is the pretty (and that is all)
woman of the plot; Paul Cavanagh is
the husband who is away from home
and consequently oil the screen too
much; Ricardo Cortez is the tempter
and one can hardly blame the wife for
not playing along with him any more
than she did. Leering eyes, stupidly
cynical mouth, and dirty disposition
are scarcely the best qualities to be
desired in any man—even a gigolo.

Bad directing apd weak lines help
make it, on the whole, boring.

THE SPY—AI (he Varsity Theatre,

"The Spy," a tale of royal Russian
emigres and how they are dogged by
the Tscheka secret police of the So
viets, is unreeling at the Varsity for
the last times today. Kay Johnson, Neil
Hamilton, and John Holliday do the
best they can with mediocre lines, but
there are a few shots of mobs and
horsemen which are worth a word.
Street gamins, flotsam and jetsam of the
"uprooting," Supply the main interest,
and do some of the bast acting.
Because of its timely theme and un
usual setting "The Spy" will pass mus
ter, but one should certainly take some
of the more obvious references to Ihe
Soviet with a grain of salt. It is almost
propaganda.

European countries still goverend by
kings are: Great Britain, Sweden, Nor
way, Denmark, Yugo-Slavia, Doumanis,
Bulgaria, Italy, Albania, and Hungary.
