# ENERGETIC WORKINGS OF CORPORATION YARD TERMED "HEART" OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Where the Administration Building
might be termed the brain, the Cor
poration Yard is the heart of Stanford.
It is constantly throbbing with the
energy that keeps Stanford's physical
self in working order and repair.
This iigurative heart is actually a
Public Works Department which makes
the Stanford campus a separate and in
dependent community. It is almost to
ri ispensible to the maintenance of the
University. The services of the Yard
are available to the living groups on
the campus and to the faculty residents.
Situated behind and across the street
from the Stanford Union, the Corpora
tion Yard is the home of carpentering,
plumbing, electrical, painting, mechan
ical, storage, road and fire departments
of the University. All 'of these divi
sions are nominally under the control
of Roy H. Button, superintendent of
buildings and grounds.
A Full-Fledged Lumber Yard
A glance into the Yard reveals, most
conspicuously, a row of garages and a
full-fledged lumber yard. The gar-iges
house the thirty automobiles and trucks
which make the service calls, and as
many privately owned vehicles as can
be accommodated.
Automobiles have become the pro
teges of the still extant blacksmith
shop, vyhose patronage has dwindled to
but one horse. This shop, which now
exists as the home of more modern
means of transportation, aids the ma
chine shop in its production of-special
apparatus for use in the various de
partments in school, when such apppa
ratus can not be purchased.
Keeps Commnity Paint Conscious
An efficient plumbing shop has
grown out of long and constant asso

ciation with the various needs of the
living groups on the campus. A truly
intimate knowledge of the weaknesses
of each plumbing arrangement in the
houses and halls has assured quick and
accurate service in response to emer
gency calls. Dripping faucets and leak
ing ceilings and needle-point showers
are all taken care of by this depart
ment, as well as the larger needs of
;water supply.
The paint shop and the woodworking
shop help keep the University tidy. It
is the aim of the one to make the Uni
versity paint-conscious, and the object
of the other to keep in repair the furni
ture of the buildings. "Surgical work"
of all kinds is carried on in this wood
working shop, in the hope of rejuvenat
ing for further use tables and chairs
and cabinets. A storage building, for
the convenience of all departments,
keeps a supply of academic necessities
from office stationery to ant paste, from
paper clips to wrought-iron pipe.
Fire Department Busiest
Busiest of all the departments at
present is the fire department, whose
chief is R. E. Dugan. To remove all fire
hazards is the occupation just now of
the fire chief and his cohorts, who are
engaged in burning off the dry fields
that surround the campus and contri
bute a definite fire menace.
Efficiency, and the ability to supply
all needs on this campus-community,
seems to be the aim of the Corporation
Yard, for the numerous shops are able
to answer almost any call that comes
in, be it for keys to fit specified locks,
an electrician to adjust a shorted wire,
a piece of lumber of certain dimen
sions, or a quick stopping of the rain
pouring through a hole in the roof.
