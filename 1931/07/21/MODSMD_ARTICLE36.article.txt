# TENNIS TOURNAMENT PROGRESSES; SECOND ROUND ENDS FRIDAY
## 
### 
Several closely contested matches
featured the play over the week-end
in the summer tennis tourney. Elwyn
Bugge, tennis director, reports that the
competition is moving along rapidly
and the players are co-operating. He
has set next Friday as the closing dale
for the second round.
In the earlier matches, two sets
seemed sufficient to declare a winner,
but more recent pairings have found
the competition close and some spirited
sets have resulted. Bugge expects better
tennis to be played as the tournament
progresses. The seeded men to date
have all emerged undefeated.
The x-esults of the matches completed
over the week-end are: Patterson d.
Enquist, 4-G, 6-3, 6-4; Hirayama d.
Brem, 6-1, 6-1; Scholtz d. Bernard 6-2,
2-6, 6-1; Osborne d. Kaulfers 6-8, 6-0,
6-1; Robbins d. Stine, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4;
Lohman d. Huira, 7-5, 7-5; and Wright
d. Ho, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2. Four of the matches
were won through default. The men
remaining in the tourney through this
means are: Fields, Johnston, Yost, and
Lambert.

Nine more pairings are listed on the
bx-acket scheduled fpr the second round.
With -the completion of these matches
the contestants will go into the quar
ter finals. Bugge expects some good
tennis to be produced from this point
on. He feels that it is a little prema 5
ture to hazard a guess as to the pos
sible winner.

The name of the winner will be in
scribed on the perpetual summer
trophy, a plaque donated by the Palo
Alto Tennis Shop.
