# THORNTON HAS GRIEF WITH CRAWL STROKE IN BEGINNING CLASS
## "No Air Under Water" Wails Encina Plunge Devotee; "Relax" Says Coach 
### 
"Keep your elbows up, relax, don't
bend your knees"—these are words
that may be heard among splashes al
most any day at Encina Pool. They
issue from the lips of Swimming Coach
Norton Thornton and are directed at
his elementary and advanced swimming
classes. The words are repeated nu
merous times every day and each time
the novices listen as though it were
the first time they had heard them.
The elementary class especially of
fers an interesting picture. Remarks
such as, "I wonder why there isn't any
air under water," and "I open my
mouth for air but don't get anything
but water," and "my trouble is I sink,"
are heard frequently and with a re
markable amount of spluttering and
splashing. These beginners listen care
fully to Thornton's implicit directions
and then, in spite of their best efforts,
do exactly the opposite.
Begins With Crawl Stroke
"In teaching the beginner to swim,
various methods are used," Thornton
said. "Many swimming authorities dis
agree as to whether the breast-stroke,
the side-stroke, or the crawl should be
taught first. The majority of leading
coaches and instructors are teaching
the crawl. I teach the crawl because it
is simple to learn and produces a fin
ished swimmer more quickly than the
other methods. It is easy to learn the
other strokes after mastering the crawl,
and, on the other hand, it is difficult to
grasp the crawl and flutter kick if one
of the other methods has been learned
first.
"There are four points to be remem
bered in mastering the crawl: the
proper kick, correct arm stroke, good
breathing, and perfect relaxation. Re
laxation is perhaps the most important.
It is practically impossible to master
this stroke while swimming rigid and
tense.
Relaxation and Co-ordination Needed
"After a swimmer has learned the
proper form' I do not believe it is
necessary that he worry about any little
inconsistencies in his stroke. Relaxa
tion and co-ordination are the things
he must watch. It is up to the indi
vidual to make good."
Coach Thornton, himself, has an en
viable record as a swimmer and a
water-polo player. After an all-state
record in high school, he entered Stan
ford and became captain of the fresh
man water-polo team. The next year
he was placed on the national inter
collegiate team, and in 1929 and 1930
was on the Ail-American wkter-polo
team. He is now assistant swimming
instructor to Ernst Brandsten.
Regarding Stanford's outlook in
aquatic sports Thornton said that sev
eral men stand an excellent chance of
being selected on the American Olym
pic swimming team, among them being
Austin Clapp, Frank Booth, Ted Wiget,
and Tuppy Gardner.

and, on the other hand, it is difficult to
grasp the crawl and flutter kick if one
of the other methods has been learned
first.
"There are four points to be remem
bered in mastering the crawl: the
proper kick, correct arm stroke, good
breathing, and perfect relaxation. Re
laxation is perhaps the most important.
It is practically impossible to master
this stroke while swimming rigid and
tense.
Relaxation and Co-ordination Needed
"After a swimmer has learned the
proper form' I do not believe it is
necessary that he worry about any little
inconsistencies in his stroke. Relaxa
tion and co-ordination are the things
he must watch. It is up to the indi
vidual to make good."
Coach Thornton, himself, has an en
viable record as a swimmer and a
water-polo player. After an all-state
record in high school, he entered Stan
ford and became captain of the fresh
man water-polo team. The next year
he was placed on the national inter
collegiate team, and in 1929 and 1930
was on the Ail-American wkter-polo
team. He is now assistant swimming
instructor to Ernst Brandsten.
Regarding Stanford's outlook in
aquatic sports Thornton said that sev
eral men stand an excellent chance of
being selected on the American Olym
pic swimming team, among them being
Austin Clapp, Frank Booth, Ted Wiget,
and Tuppy Gardner.
"Keep your elbows up, relax, don't
bend your knees"—these are words
that may be heard among splashes al
most any day at Encina Pool. They
issue from the lips of Swimming Coach
Norton Thornton and are directed at
his elementary and advanced swimming
classes. The words are repeated nu
merous times every day and each time
the novices listen as though it were
the first time they had heard them.
The elementary class especially of
fers an interesting picture. Remarks
such as, "I wonder why there isn't any
air under water," and "I open my
mouth for air but don't get anything
but water," and "my trouble is I sink,"
are heard frequently and with a re
markable amount of spluttering and
splashing. These beginners listen care
fully to Thornton's implicit directions
and then, in spite of their best efforts,
do exactly the opposite.
Begins With Crawl Stroke
"In teaching the beginner to swim,
various methods are used," Thornton
said. "Many swimming authorities dis
agree as to whether the breast-stroke,
the side-stroke, or the crawl should be
taught first. The majority of leading
coaches and instructors are teaching
the crawl. I teach the crawl because it
is simple to learn and produces a fin
ished swimmer more quickly than the
other methods. It is easy to learn the
other strokes after mastering the crawl,
and, on the other hand, it is difficult to
grasp the crawl and flutter kick if one
of the other methods has been learned
first.
