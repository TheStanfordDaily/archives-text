# BUILD BEAUTIFUL LIFE PLEADS REV. PALMER
## 
### 
Preaching his third sermon in Me- '
j morial Church, the Rev. Albert W.
i Palmer of the Chicago Theological .
j Seminary, on Sunday chose as his topic,
J "The Art of Living."
"Lay hold on the life which is the
j life indeed," was his text, from First
â–  Timothy VI, 19.
That the greatest thing in life is to
i build from the materials at hand, tak
' ing into consideration our limitations
' and forever striving forward, was the
major theme. Numerous illustrations i
j of persons who succeeded in this way I
were listed by the Reverend Palmer.
The raw materials of life are our
bodies, minds, families, and communi- '
ties, and in building with these ma- j
terials the individual needs a spirit that
will acquiesce with the facts, a vision
to understand them, a capacity for suf- i
fering, and inspiration. Great artists j
were credited with these qualities by !
the speaker, but Christ was cited as ,
the supreme example of one who began j
life from humble beginnings and made
it a thing of beauty.
