# MacNAUGHTON BOWS TO MOE IN WESTERN AMATEUR GOLF FINAL
## 
### 
Malcolm MacNaughton, Stanford golf
star, reached the final round in the
Western Amateur Golf Championship
only to go down to defeat at the hands
of Don Moe in the thirty-six hole final
match last Saturday at Portland. The
score was nine and seven up.
Moe's sensational putting and Mac-
Naughton's wildness, particularly from
the tee, accounted for the overwhelm
ing score. Moe, who was Western ama
teur titlist in 1929, played a steady
consistent game with an uncanny abil
ity on the greens.
The two other Stanford representa
tives, Charles Seaver and Lawson Lit
tle, were eliminated in earlier rounds.
