# MOFFATT, HILLMAN RECOVERING FROM FOOTBALL INJURIES
## 
### 
Stanford's list of football cripples has
been greatly reduced with the quick
recoveries of Captain-elect Harry Hill
man and Phil Moffatt.
Last season Hillman injured his
knee-cap in the Big Game and it has
been bothering him all winter. This
spring, when finals were over, Hillman
entered a Los Angeles hospital to have
the tricky knee operated upon so that
it would not spoil his football chances
for the coming season. The operation
has been a great success, and Hillman
reports that the knee is better than
evei\
Phil Moffatt, left halfback on Stan
ford's 1930 varsity, who broke his left
ankle during spring practice, has-been
walking around the Quad the last few
days without his cruetches, the broken
bone having completely knit.
According to Dr. E. F. Roth, Moffatt's
ankle has healed faster than expected
and it is one of the quickest recoveries
ever to be recorded on the campus.
Moffatt has been shooting a few rounds
of golf and doing other light exercise
to keep in good condition for the fall
football season; but Dr. Roth does not
want him to do any strenuous exercise
for another .week or ten days, so as to
give the broken bone plenty of time
to heal.
Just before "Pop" Warner and "Tiny"
Thornhill left for their fishing trip,
Warner cautioned Moflatt to bo careful
and to watch out for his ankle. "Pop"
is planning to build most of his 1931
offensive plays around Hillman and
Moffatt.
