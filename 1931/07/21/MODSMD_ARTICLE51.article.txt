leading organ virtuosi in France today.
Bonnet's Ariel (after a x'eading of
Shakespeare) and Dupre's Antiphon oil

Mercy," are the numbers 'chosen to
represent the work of these composers.

clude Thursday's program.
On Sunday evening Ssther Houk Allen,
contralto, will sing two old Welsh airs,
"All Through the Night" and "March
of the Men of Harlech," and an old
English tune arranged by Ralph
Vaughn-Williams in his Oxford Book
of Carols, "The Truth from Above."
The organ program will include Six
Variations on an Old Irish Air, by J.
Stuart Archer, the theme of which is
the traditional tune, "At the Marriage
Feast in Cana," sung in the province of
Munster; Prelude on a Welsh Hymn-
Tune, "Rhosymedre" (Lovely), by R.
Vaughn-Williams; Andantino from the
"Scotch Fantasia," by William C. Mac-
Farlane, in which the composer weaves
together "Comin' Thro' the Rye" and
"Annie Laurie"; and Chorale-Prelude,
'Monmouth," by Frederick H. Wood.
This composition is from Scenes on the
Wye, and is based on the stirring old
English "Song of Agincourt" (1415).
American folk music and European
folk music are to be played at the
regular recitals next week.
