# Jewish Literature Title of Rabbi Levy Talk
## Reveals Origin And Evolution Of Semitic Laws 
### 
That Jewish literature is not entirely
dead but about to live again is the
| hope expressed by Rabbi Felix Levy
) of the Jewish Chautauqua Society in
i his lecture, "Main Currents in Jewish
Literature," given in the Little Theatre
last night.
Rabbi Levy made two divisions or
"main streams" in Jewish literature,
namely legal and non-legal, though he
noted the inadequacy of these English
I terms to convey his full meaning. He
said:
"The legal current is that literature
which started in Biblical times. The
Bible to the Jew was the word of God,
the law. Thus the study and perfection
of law has been a mode of Jewish
worship. Law was central, necessary,
alive, literally a doctrine for the Jew.
Side by side with the Biblical law there
grew up a mass of unwritten laws.
Eventually these were written down.
The first original code was called the
Mishna. Then the Gemara was written
and the two comprised the Talmud.
"Jewish law is liberal. It demands
that men shall live a full, rich life as
this axiom illustrates: 'God will punish
any man who denies himself any legiti
mate pleasure in life.'"
Rabbi Levy described the non-legal
current of literature as the "velvet"
which covers the sharp edges of the
ever-present moral laws and lessons
found in Jewish writings.
The story of the creation of woman
was said to typify this current. Eve's
evolution from Adam'si rib signifies
that, coming from a part close to man's
heart, the seat of love, woman should
be loved by man.
"Jewish literatui'c, mostly written in
Hebrew, reflects the soul of the Jew,
his joys, sorrows, triumphs, disasters,
virtues, and faults throughout 4,000
years," declared Rabbi Levy.
The legal literature has not been
given credit for the effect it has had on
early European and modern law, he be
lieves.
