# WATER PRESSURE ON CAMPUS IS DOUBLED STATES TROWBRIDGE
## Four Pumps Furnish Supply From Searsville And Felt Lakes 
### 
Water pressure on the campus is
double that of previous years although I
water is more scarce. In explanation of j
this fact A. L. Trowbridge, assistant j
comptroller of the University, says that 1
in addition to the regular head from
Searsville lake there is pressure fur
nished by four pumps, two taking water
from the San Franciscquito district,
and two from the arboretum.
With this increased pressure it is
possible to obtain the same volume of
water from hydrants half opened as
has been secured heretofore from wide
open faucets. Or, if irrigation is done
by hand, as is suggested by the Uni
versity in a second letter sent to cam
pus residents Thursday, the increased
pressure makes it possible to irrigate
a given area in perhaps half the time
formerly required.
The University has cut in half its
consumption of water on the campus
gardens, as well as on the golf course,
with no ill effects to be noted by the
casual observer.
Pumps are lifting water from the 400-
foot level, as are those of the City of
Palo Alto. This lowered water level
materially increases the cost of pump
| ing.
j According to Trowbridge the year
1917 was the last when the rainfall was
! sufficient to water the campus without
supplementation. Since then a supply
1 of water at least sufficient to irrigate
the University grounds and campus J
yards until December 1 has been im
pounded.
