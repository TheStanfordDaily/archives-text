# MODERN MUSIC IS ROOZINSKI'S FINAL FEATURE
## Composer Concludes Second Woodland Concert in Blaze of Glory Charleston, Taxi-Horns, And Blues Are Portrayed in "American in Paris" 
### 
A symphony orchestra wailing the
i j blues, tripping through a two-step, and
; I blaring a Charleston to the accompani
, | ment of taxi-horns—that was what a
. casual listener might have thought had
he stopped to listen to the Woodland
, Symphony Orchestra last Sunday in
its portrayal of George Gershwin's "An
American in Paris." Artur Rodzinski,
conducting his second and concluding
' concert, included the selection in this
; program of modern numbers.
While Gershwin's composition was
| certainly not the "piece de resistance"
of Sunday's program, the sheer novelty
of the sprightly number interested
: everyone. According to Deems Taylor,
j composer and music critic, "An Ameri
' can in Paris" engages to tell an emo
| tional narrative; to convey, in terms
j of sound, the successive emotional re
j actions experienced by a Yankee tour
-1 ist adrift in the "City of Light." And
j so the listener sees, via the music, the
] American strolling gaily down the
: boulevards, assaulted by taxi-horns,
1 becoming pleasantly "tight," getting the
| "blues," and finally joining with a com
-1 panion for a night of pleasure.
| Rodzinski's Treatment Sympathetic
Aside from the obvious introduction
j of jazz technique into the piece, it has
j some passages of beauty. The pathos of
S the "blues" theme was undeniable, and
! its treatment by the various instru
-1 ments was memorable as Rodzinski's
j treatment of the score was sympa
( thetic. He did not dress it up into
I something it obviously was not, and
! yet he was never sarcastic or academic.
Following "An American in Paris"
I came the now famous "Bolero'" by
j Ravel. The insistent rhythm, and the
j rather simple melody of this intriguing
! number are familiar to nearly every
! one. Instrument after instrument takes
! up the theme, then groups of instru
i ments, while the rhythmical back
| ground is swelling in gradual crescendo.
| Rodzinski's handling of this develop
i ment and the final explosive modula
j tion were remarkably well done. If one
! had heard the "Bolero" a dozen times
! before, he would have been thrilled at
j the presentation last Sunday.
Symphony Features Mysticism
The opposite extreme from Gersh-
I win's almost flippant music, was ex
| pressed in Alexander Scriabin's Sym
j phony No. 3, in C Minor. Mysticism and
| profound spiritual struggle are por
j trayed in the Russian composer's score.
' The whole lengthy symphony, running
; in continuous flow without a break, is
| said to portray the liberation of the life
! of the spirit from its temporal fetters.
I In music that is strangely moving and
' disturbing in its emotionality, one may
i imagine the soul's strife with the bonds
j of the flesh, its struggle against sensual
j pleasures, the final conquering of the
J baser animal instincts, and at last, the
j victory—the affirmation of personality.
Rodzinski, as in the Fifth Symphony
j of Tsehaikowsky, conducted this with
j a fine appreciation of its significance,
j The energy and forcefulness of his di
; recting does not leave out the finer
nuances.

Program Opens With "Oberon"
■ Opening the concert was the Over-
I turc to "Oberon" by von Weber. The
j music of this fairy opera is reviewed
|in the Overture. Beginning with the
I magic horn's summoning of the fairies,
jit includes a fairy chorus, a march
I theme, and several songs which are
j prominent in the work. The Overture
j is a most remarkable combination of
fantasy and technical skill.
j At the conclusion of the performance
I Sunday, the second and last one that
he will conduct at Hillsborough this
summer, Rodzinski was given an en
j thusiastic acclaim. He is undoubtedly a
. the Woodland audiences.
Next Sunday's conductor will be a
1 Frenchman, Pierre Monteux.
