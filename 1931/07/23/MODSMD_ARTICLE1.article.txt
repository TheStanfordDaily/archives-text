# PIERRE MONTEUX REHEARSES FOR SUNDAY CONCERT
## French Director Will Lead, Symphony Orchestra In Sixth Program Composers of Conductor's Native Land to Have Prominent Place 
### 
Pierre Monteux, who will be the |
fourth guest conductor of the sym- i
phony orchestra playing in the Wood- ,
land Theatre at Hillsborough, arrived
in San Francisco from Paris this week
and is rehearsing daily with the orches
tra in preparation for the concert Sun- j
day. Although Monteux has appeared
in the United States many times be- i
fore, this will be his first appearance '
at Hillsborough.
Monteux first came to America in '
1916 as conductor for the Russian Bai- !
let, which made a transcontinental
tour. For two seasons following he con
ducted the French operas at the Metro
politan Opera in Now York, and in 1919
he was appointed conductor of the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra, which he di
rected for five years. During the sum
mer of 1927 he appeared for a few con
certs at the Stadium in New York and
at the Hollywood Bowl.
Is Devoted to Modern Composers
Since his return to France in 1925 he
has been conductor of the Orchestra
Symphonique de Paris for half of the
regular winter season, and the other
half he shares with Willcm Mengelberg
in the directiton of the Concertgebouw
Orchestra of Amsterdam, one of the
most noted in Europe.
Although including in his repertoire
practically every work regularly played
by symphony orchestras, Monteux has
achieved pre-eminent distinction and
recognition because of his interest in
and devotion to modern composers and
their works. It is said that he probably
has presented for the first time more I
new works than any other single con- !
ductor now before the public. His con- i
certs in Paris are the mecca of com- j
posers seeking audition for their latest
works.
Will Conduct Only Once
Complying with the policy of the
summer concerts in the Woodland i
Theatre, Monteux has arranged a pro
gram which will be in part characteris
tic and expressive of the conductor's
nationality and representative of the |
composers of his own country. Works i
of Ravel, whose '"Bolero" was a feature.!
of the concei't last Sunday, and Cha- j
brier are to be included.
Reminiscent of Monteux's visit to this )
country with the Russian Ballet, he will j
present excerpts from Rimski-Korsa
koff's ballet pantomime, "Scherhera- \
zade," which the Ballet first performed '
here.
Sunday's concert will be the only one j
Monteux will conduct here.

Complying with the policy of the
summer concerts in the Woodland i
Theatre, Monteux has arranged a pro
gram which will be in part characteris
tic and expressive of the conductor's
nationality and representative of the |
composers of his own country. Works i
of Ravel, whose '"Bolero" was a feature.!
of the concei't last Sunday, and Cha- j
brier are to be included.
Reminiscent of Monteux's visit to this )
country with the Russian Ballet, he will j
present excerpts from Rimski-Korsa
koff's ballet pantomime, "Scherhera- \
zade," which the Ballet first performed '
here.
Sunday's concert will be the only one j
Monteux will conduct here.
Pierre Monteux, who will be the |
fourth guest conductor of the sym- i
phony orchestra playing in the Wood- ,
land Theatre at Hillsborough, arrived
in San Francisco from Paris this week
and is rehearsing daily with the orches
tra in preparation for the concert Sun- j
day. Although Monteux has appeared
in the United States many times be- i
fore, this will be his first appearance '
at Hillsborough.
Monteux first came to America in '
1916 as conductor for the Russian Bai- !
let, which made a transcontinental
tour. For two seasons following he con
ducted the French operas at the Metro
politan Opera in Now York, and in 1919
he was appointed conductor of the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra, which he di
rected for five years. During the sum
mer of 1927 he appeared for a few con
certs at the Stadium in New York and
at the Hollywood Bowl.
Is Devoted to Modern Composers
Since his return to France in 1925 he
has been conductor of the Orchestra
Symphonique de Paris for half of the
regular winter season, and the other
half he shares with Willcm Mengelberg
in the directiton of the Concertgebouw
Orchestra of Amsterdam, one of the
most noted in Europe.
Although including in his repertoire
practically every work regularly played
by symphony orchestras, Monteux has
achieved pre-eminent distinction and
recognition because of his interest in
and devotion to modern composers and
their works. It is said that he probably
has presented for the first time more I
new works than any other single con- !
ductor now before the public. His con- i
certs in Paris are the mecca of com- j
posers seeking audition for their latest
works.
Will Conduct Only Once
