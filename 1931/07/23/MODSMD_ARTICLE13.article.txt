# EIGHTH CENTURY JUDGES CHOOSE BEAUTY QUEEN 'MISS BYZANTIUM'
## 
### 
Byzantine beauties, lined up for ex
amination by officials equipped with
measuring tapes and an eighth-century
1 species of intelligence test, were de
scribed by Professor Henri Gregoire in
j his lecture yesterday afternoon on the
; beauty contests held -in Byzantium in
| the eighth and ninth centuries.
I A "Miss Byzantium" contest, the win
ner of which married the emperor, was
held in Contantinople whenever the
! emperor wished to be married, or
J whenever someone else wished to
marry him off, according to Professor
Gregoire, who went on to describe the
assembling of the winners of the pro
vincial contests and the procedure of
1 the final competition in the great city
j of the Byzantine empire. Final choice
j in the matter was made by the person,
or one of the two persons, most directly
j concerned; namely, the emperor him
self.
Loser in Delicate Position
Describing the difficulties of the con
! tests, the lecturer said that the organ
i izers of such tournaments both then
! and now have not troubled themselves
' with finding a congenial job or suitable
' occupation for either the winners or
for the losers, and so queens of beauty,
officially recognized as such, are not
better off in many cases than their sis
ters, the queens and princesses in
j exile. Professor Gregoire described the
j delicate position of the candidates who
failed to become Miss Byzantiumâ€”a
1 position which left the attractive run
ners-up with the one alternative of
I going into a nunnery.
From the point of view of scholar
j ship, he said, the sad fate of the re
ejected ladies was advantageous, since a

I nun is more likely to become a saint
| than an empress. Professor Gregoire
j cited examples of saints who were once
! candidates and who "failed to get their
degrees."-
Church Attitude Favorable'
Concerning the attitude of the church
on the question of beauty contests, Pro
fessor Grqgoirc, mentioning that the
Pope has recently condemned the dan
gerous worship of beauty, exclaimed
upon how surprised the many enemies
of pulchritude contests would be if they
heard that the orthodox church of
Greece at the time of the Byzantine
empire not only favored but actually
patronized an institution which is not
novel but as old as the later Roman
empire.
! According to the lecturer, people
I thought that the young emperor, being
| given the best looking and cleverest
I woman of his empire, would be less
j given to philandering. "The result of
the beauty contests was in the main
satisfactory," he stated, "but there were
| occasional failures." He gave as an ex
j ample of this occasional mistake in
I judging the most desirable in the realm
| the case of Constantino, son of Irene,
! who disliked and finally divorced the
| winner of the final competition because
he had previously fallen in love with a
| young chambermaid.
Professor Gregoire concluded his lcc
l ture by relating the curious adventures
I of a would-be empress of Byzantium
| who, having failed, bravely resigned
! herself to holiness.
The next lecture of this series on
| Byzantine culture and civilization,
j given in French, will be next Wednes-
I day at 4:15 o'clock in the Littiu Theatre.
