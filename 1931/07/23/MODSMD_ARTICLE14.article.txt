### 
Russia's Five-Year Plan, especially
j as it has affected education, was inter
preted by Dr. E. P. Cubberley in an
address Wednesday noon at the Union
before the Education Club.
After explaining the general features
of the now famous plan, Dr. Cubberley
pointed out that many of the changes
| the Soviet governemnt has made in the
I educational system were for the pur
pose of training people to carry out the
i plan. He declared that in addition to
! carrying out this objective, illiteracy
I has been reduced to a large extent.
Referring to a late book on Russia,
1 "New Russia's Primer," Dr. Cubberley
| explained that it was written by an
| engineer for use in what would cor
respond to our junior high school
grades. The book, he said, is written
| in a simple graphic style, and is in
-1 tended to give to school children a con
! ception of what the Five-Year Plan is
I and how it is being carried out.
Dr. Cubberley continued his talk by
j saying that while the vision behind the
j plan was a great one, the plan was a
| menace to other nations of the world.
I He also declared that while the eco
nomic condition of the peasants has
been somewhat improved, they are
i subjected to a form of oppression which
J in some respects is as severe as it was
i in the old regime.
