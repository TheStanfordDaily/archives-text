# "Discard Washington and Monroe Doctrines in New Relations Plan:" Stuart
## United States Should Reduce Tariff; Enter World Court; Revise Debt Settlements; Says Lecturer 
### 
WIIE time has come for the United States to discard the doctrines of Washington
and Monroe and follow those inaugurated by Woodrow Wilson with regard
to foreign affairs," was the startling statement made by Graham 11. Stuart,
professor of political science, Tuesday evening in the Little Theatre. He dis
cussed the financial crisis in Europe.

"The United States should now be willing to accept a loss in the allied debt
settlements and revisions, which," Stuart declared, "must be a part of the plan

to avert the present economic crisis in 1
recognize the immediate relationship of t
tion revisions, as it was stated that forcij

Europe." It was his belief that we must
he debt settlement with German repara
gn nations would be unwilling to change
• present plans unless a satisfactory ar
! rangement of both questions is alTccted.
Stuart Favors Moratorium
Favoring President Hoover's plan,
I Stuart characterized the moratorium as
i merely a year's postponement of the
! "evil day" when debts must be paid,
j "During this time the nations must eo
• operate to lind a further solution of
j financial and economics problems," he
j declared. It is his-belief that Germany
| has made an honest attempt to meet
I the present reparation demands.
In prescribing a plan of action for
the United States Stuart stated that we
should reduce the high tarifT, which is
a cause of foreign resentment; enter
the world court; revise present allied
debt arrangements; and determine <o
assume our obligations as a world
power by entering whole-heartedly in
the solution of all European troubles.
Hoover Delayed by Senate
"Our entry into present European
difficulties, as marked by President
Hoover's proposal, was necessarily de
layed until a crisis was reached that
would assure Hoover the support of
| the United States Senate," the speaker
j stated. He also pointed out that Europe
1 today is placing its chief confidence of
j economic solidarity in the bank of in
ternational settlement.
In regard to the political situation it
was declared that popular interest in
Briand's proposal of a United States of
Europe is rapidly waning. Visits to Eu
rope in 1920, 1925, and 1930 by Stuart
have disclosed an increasing sense of
security in certain nations but a num
ber of "danger spots" arc Still evident.
! In this connection he cited Italy as one
of the points of discontent because of
its dictator, who, according to Stuart,
"might do anything."
Concluding the talk Stuart said that
it was his belief that future armament
settlements must be definitely tied up
with an agreement of the United States
. to revise the present allied debt settle
ment.
