# INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR SUMMER STUDENTS
## 
### 
Elsewhere in this paper is a report of a talk by Professor E. E.,
Robinson on Stanford's independent study plan. Among other
things, Professor Robinson said that the plan had not been so
successful as it might be because the students were not ready j
for it.
Probably an independent study plan will not work with
some types of individuals. It will not work with merely mentally
brilliant students. Resides having an intellect capable of work-!
ing independently, students who would protit by the plan must
have qualities of perseverance and resourcefulness. Those vir-,
tues constitute minimum essentials.
A group which as a whole would probably rate pretty high
in tlie last-named characteristics (whether their I.Q.'s would be
adequate or not might be argued) is the summer-quarter student |
body. Might il not be a good idea to provide some sort of inde-j
pendent study plan for the educators who make up so large a
proportion of those attending here in the summer? It is a fair
assumption that the large majority of them are here for serious i
purposes. Moreover, they have been out on their own for a while
and, sobered bv experience, would be able to obtain from such a
system the full benefit to be derived.
Many of those attending have special problems which they
have encountered during their professional work. Work that
they could and would do in pursuit of such problems could be
made to measure up to the best scholastic requirements. The
relief from regular attendance at classes would be welcome and
advantageous to such students.
Perhaps it would not work. Rut if the independent study
plan can work with any group il should work with teachers and
educational administrators who come here in the summer for
advanced work.
