# EVEN TEACHERS NEED SLEEP
## 
### 
A recent news story says that two investigators at a certain
university had gone without sleep for 100 hours tor the purpose
of discovering the effects on their mental ability and altitudes.
They discovered, of course, that study was practically impos
sible after they missed a little more than the usual amount of
sleep. Their conclusion, which can har'dly be called revolution
ary, is that "the collegiate brain needs eight full hours of sleep*
every night."
Although that term "collegiate brain" is subject to a wide and
interesting interpretation, we can assume, without doing any
violence to the investigators' report, that it refers to the mind of
a college or university student, including a university summer;
quarter student.
The moral is that those attending Stanford this summer who
are burning the well-knowu candle at both ends in an attempt
to distinguish themselves scholasticallv are taking a short
sighted course. 11 has an especial application to teachers, since
they, more than most professional people, need that enthusiasm
and nervous control which only a healthy nervous system can
produce.
The University as such can't do much about the matter; il
can't compel students to get sufficient sleep outside the classroom
(and that is the only kind under discussion). Hut worth a
serious thought and appropriate action by students is the possi
bility of spending so many hours at books that tin 1 results aw
less valuable than fewer hours with a sleep-refreshed mind |
would be.
