# "EVEN IF YOU AIN'T THERE"

"This (laliv, just give him a compass and one peek al Ihe
Giant Dipper and he can tell you where you are even if you
ain't there."
Thus wrote Will Rogers in his enthusiasm over the Posl-
Gatty world-circling airplane flight, referring to the navigator,
of the trip.
II will not do to become too ponderous about the gay exag
geration of the daily pungent paragraphs of America's most
popular humorist, and yet there is a text here for a little ser
mon —which Will did not intend at nil.
The suggestion thai Harold (iatty with a simple compass and
one peek at the Great Dipper can tell where his plane is does
him somewhat more than justice—and a great deal less. He
can't do that. Rut he can with one peek at a star tell where he
is—with the aid of a highly specialized instrument. And he
invented this instrument.
Will is inclined to scoff somewhat at "experts" and school
trained specialists and to laud Ihe simple native horse sense of
"ordinary folks." II won't do here. Gaily doesn't figure out his
whereabouts in a pathless fog bv using his inborn sense and ;i
Rov Scout compass. He is a highly trained man, trained in Ihe
finest schools, and he had to have this training to be able to
devise the "compass" that tells you where you are.
And when (iattv says where his plane is in the void between
sky and mist with one star glimmering momentarily through a
break in Ihe thick sky, thai is where the plane is there is no
"even if you ain't there" about il. That's the beauty of skill and
knowledge based on hard-won facts as compared with the less
laboriously acquired good horse sense. Disappointment and
disaster threaten when an airplane pilot or anybody else takes
the word of a man who "tells you where you are even if you
ain't there."
