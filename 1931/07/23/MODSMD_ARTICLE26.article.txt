Varsity Theatre.
A highly amusing farce buill around
i the most impossible of plots, this pic- j
ture is an excellent antidote for that
tired depressed feeling. •It points no
| moral except possibly that one can
pass through serious difficulties pleas
antly if one is partially drunk. It pre-
I sents no problem more serious than
how to succeed if one is penniless but
| irresponsible.
i What story there is concerns a flighty J
girl (Jeannette Mac Donald) whose nus- j
j band, a rough but good-as-gold mil
lionaire from Montana (Victor McLag- i
len), attempts to gel hold of fifty shares j
of mining stock from another million
! aire, who apparently is never sober
! (Roland Young).
j Jeannette Mac Donald, entering into j
the spirit of the thing, does a good job
of her part. It is too bad that she .was |
! not given an opportunity to sing more j
l than she does. Victor MeLaglen's size, l
j voice, and features make him well cast |
in the part of the uncouth millionaire
from out West. Roland Young as Ihe
i perpetual inebriated millionaire with
! an uncontrollable urge to break things,
\ nearly runs away with the show at
| times.

An "East meets West" affair present- !
ing Gary Cooper in another of his usual
■ hard, he-man roles. His style may be-
I I come tiresome one of these days but'
i just at present he pleases immensely. '
Playing the part of a cowpuncher he
; meets and falls in love (against his
| will) with the ranch-owner's daughter
1 who was "exiled" from her father's
j luxurious home in the. East because of
; carefree and somewhat indiscreet ac
tions. They are married and settle t'own
j for a time on a little ranch, but some
thing within her revolts at the crude
ness of it all and she leaves for home.
He follows her and convinces her Ihat 1
1 she still loves him and will in time
| learn to love the West.
Carole Lombard is the girl, and ex
j hibits some fine acting.
