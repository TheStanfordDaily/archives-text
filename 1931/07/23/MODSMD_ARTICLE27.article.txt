SCENERY: A Manual of Scenic De
sign. By Harold Helvenston, Director
of Dramatics, Stanford University.
The Stanford University Press.
In less than a hundred pages—though !
the pages are large—and with about 75
illustrations, Harold Helvenston, who i
directs Stanford's efforts in dramatics '
1 and has been associated with many
other non-professional enterprises of
the sort, has packed about all that an
amateur needs to know of the tech- j
I nique and problems of scene design. !
; The book is for those who bear the re
| sponsibility of tilting stage setting for
j the productions of little theatres, dra
: matic clubs, school and college plays.
It offers practical guidance lor those
who with limited budgets would never
theless like to do something better than
! rely on ready-made scenery, found
hanging around from earlier perform
.! ances, or "just a few drapes."
Helvenston includes enough theory
! to give force to his practical advice and i
suggestions. He opens the book wilh
I the characteristics of good stage seen- 1
j ery and the objectives and problems of
the designer. Then he follows through
! the process of developing a stage set- I
! ting: The consideration of the play |
I and of the mood that should be empha- |
j sized, the steps of the practical working j
j out of the sets, with working drawings, j
, scening sketch and models, and finally I
deals with light and lighting, scenic
painting, and the practical considera- j
I tions of cost. At the end of the book is !
j a rapid-fire history of theatrical scen
ery, from .the Greeks down to the most j
modern exponents, a glossary of tech- !
nical terms and an index that helps j
j make the volume a useful handbook I
! and reference guide.
Kenneth MacGowan, in a foreword,
| says: "Here at last we have a first-rate
J designer writing a practical manual. !
Therefore it is a nice combination of j
j theory and practice. Not too much of .
high-flown generalities; not too much
of technical details."
MacGowan speaks a word of praise
concerning the significance of Helven
! ston's book in relation to university
1 instruction. The volume, he says, 'is
printed and published by a university.

SCENERY: A Manual of Scenic De
sign. By Harold Helvenston, Director
of Dramatics, Stanford University.
The Stanford University Press.
In less than a hundred pages—though !
the pages are large—and with about 75
illustrations, Harold Helvenston, who i
directs Stanford's efforts in dramatics '
1 and has been associated with many
other non-professional enterprises of
the sort, has packed about all that an
amateur needs to know of the tech- j
I nique and problems of scene design. !
; The book is for those who bear the re
| sponsibility of tilting stage setting for
j the productions of little theatres, dra
: matic clubs, school and college plays.
It offers practical guidance lor those
who with limited budgets would never
theless like to do something better than
! rely on ready-made scenery, found
hanging around from earlier perform
.! ances, or "just a few drapes."
Helvenston includes enough theory
! to give force to his practical advice and i
suggestions. He opens the book wilh

j ery and the objectives and problems of
the designer. Then he follows through
! the process of developing a stage set- I
! ting: The consideration of the play |
I and of the mood that should be empha- |
j sized, the steps of the practical working j
j out of the sets, with working drawings, j
, scening sketch and models, and finally I
deals with light and lighting, scenic
painting, and the practical considera- j

j a rapid-fire history of theatrical scen
ery, from .the Greeks down to the most j
modern exponents, a glossary of tech- !
nical terms and an index that helps j
j make the volume a useful handbook I
! and reference guide.
