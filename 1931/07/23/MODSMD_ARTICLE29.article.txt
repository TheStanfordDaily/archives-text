# The 						Poem of the Week
## 
### 
Hallien Hickman is the authoress of
| the "poem of the week," submitted to
the Daily by Miss Alice C. Cooper, who
I is giving a course in verse forms this
quarter. Miss Hickman's poem, "These
Things I Love," is as follows:
THESE THINGS \ LOVE
i I love to see young trees that bend and
nod to all who pass,
: That sweep their branches low and
wide, that try to touch the grass.
; I love to hear the foam-ruffed waves
march up the whitened beach,
And grasp at stern-faced rocks of brown
that tower above their reach.
1 love to feel the wind sweep by and
touch the earth in joy,
, And stoop to kiss a half-closed bud,
or make each cloud a toy.
! Some things T love are quickly gone
like ripples on the river,
But slim, young trees, the sea, the wind
â€”these are mine forever!
This is one of a series of "poems of
' the week" which are appearing each
i week in Ihe Daily and are submitted by
| the members of the class in verse
I forms.
