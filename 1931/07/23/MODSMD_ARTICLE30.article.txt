# BERGSTROM MEASURES CHEMICAL REACTIVITY; DRAWS COMPARISONS
## Alumnus Carries On Work Of Dr. Franklin in Compound Relationships 
### 
Extricating himself from a maze of
beakers, flasks, and glass tubes all
sizzling with active ingredients, Fran
cis W. Bergstrom, assistant professor
of chemistry, stopped work yesterday
just long enough to tell Daily reporters
that he is working on experiments of
little immediate commercial value, but
with important scientific aspects. Berg
strom told of his work with pyridine
and quinoline compounds in an effort
to measure their chemical reactivity.

Continuing the work begun by Dr.
E. C. Franklin, professor emeritus of
organic chemistry, Bergstrom is trying
to find new reactions and relationships
in compounds containing nitrogen, and
to draw comparisons between reactions
from these nitrogen compounds and
oxygen compounds previously studied.

Results of Bergstrom's investigations
have been published in the Journal of
the American Chemical Society, Jour
nal of Physical Chemistry, and other
scientific magazines.

In one of his most recent articles
published in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society, the ex
perimental evidence presented shows
the striking analogy betwen the reac
tions of glyoxal and those of quihoxa
line substantiating the consideration of
the latter as a substituted ammono
glyoxal. The usefulness of the am
monia system viewpoint in the study
of this and similar heterocyclic com
pounds is evident, and also through
Professor Bergstorm's experiments
many derivatives of quinoxaline have
been prepared.
Bergstrom studied chemistry at Stan
ford, and received his Ph.D. in 1922.
He has been on the faculty since 1925.
