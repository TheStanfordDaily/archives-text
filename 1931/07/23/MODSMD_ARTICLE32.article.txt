# BOAT-HOUSE IS LAST HOME OF ANCIENT SOPH HAZING POSTERS
## 
### 
! There still remains one building on
j the campus that dates back to the
"good old days" and continues to carry
j on that fast diminishing line of Stan
i ford traditions—the boat-house on Lake
j Lagunita.

The boat-house is a throw-back -to
1 the early mid-Victorian days at Stan
: ford when the roughs .rode around the
J Quad on bicycles and Mrs. Stanford
j would drive into Palo Alto in her open
! carriage with a small black silk parasol
j shading her head from the sun.

Two years ago when the old trolley
j line that ran from the Bookstore into
Palo Alto was discontinued, students
j and alumni alike bemoaned the fact
J that the oldest Stanford tradition had
| gone by the boards. Nevermore could
| the frosh grab the last trolley back to
j Encina after the eleven-thirty show in,
! town. The new buses were faster and
| gave better service, but the roughs
| were not interested in saving time, they
I wanted to save traditions. Marty a night
when the current went "dead" the fel
j lows would shove the car all the way
j up to Encina.
Last month when "Pop" Harris' boot-

I black stand was cleaned and painted
I and the fragments of old sophomore
hazing posters were torn down, the
Stanford rough was at last resigned to
his fate. The campus had undergone a
change, and to him, nothing of the old
' days remained.
The waiting-room for the trolley
used to be combined with "Pop's"
! place, and many a freshman got his
j first impression of Stanford life when
!he got oft' the street car and came
| face to face with the scare posters that
were put there by the sophomores.
Many a time the sophomores would
have an official party of delegates there
I to greet and welcome the new arrivals.
But the boat-house has held out all
; these years against change. New stu
i dents here for the Summer Quarter
! know nothing about the "glorious old
'l ruin" because the last year was an
i exceptionally dry season, and when
! there is no water there is no boating.
During the last few years all of the
sophomore scare posters but one have
been torn down or painted over. This
last hazing poster sums up the real old
Stanford spirit in one sentence, "Only
The Weak Shall Inherit The Tub."

! There still remains one building on
j the campus that dates back to the
"good old days" and continues to carry
j on that fast diminishing line of Stan
i ford traditions—the boat-house on Lake
j Lagunita.

The boat-house is a throw-back -to
1 the early mid-Victorian days at Stan
: ford when the roughs .rode around the
J Quad on bicycles and Mrs. Stanford
j would drive into Palo Alto in her open
! carriage with a small black silk parasol
j shading her head from the sun.

Two years ago when the old trolley
j line that ran from the Bookstore into
Palo Alto was discontinued, students
j and alumni alike bemoaned the fact
J that the oldest Stanford tradition had
| gone by the boards. Nevermore could
| the frosh grab the last trolley back to
j Encina after the eleven-thirty show in,
! town. The new buses were faster and
| gave better service, but the roughs
| were not interested in saving time, they
