# 'HAIRY APE' PRESENTS BROAD CONTRASTS IN CHARACTER TYPES
## 'Yank,' Brutal 'Missing Link,' Plays Opposite Young Society Girl 
### 
"The Hairy Ape," by Eugene O'Neill,
offers a wide variety of contrasts in
the leading roles. First is the contrast
between "Yank," about whom the ac
tion and theme of the play revolves,
and Paddy, mates in the firemen's fore
castle of a transatlantic liner. "Yank,"
interpreted by Peter Heiser, is broader,
fiercer, more truculent, more powerful,
more sure of himself, than all the rest
of the stokers. His superior strength is
respected, with the grudging respect of
fear, to be sure. He represents their

most highly dveloped civilization, but
something which civilization left be
hind, a veritable missing link. He can
not find his place on earth, once it is
shown him that he doesn't belong.

Paddy, played by Carl Cartwright. is
recognizable enough; he is a little
wizened old Irishman, exhibiting the
sad, patient pathos of a monkey. He is
a dreaming sentimentalist to the core,
in direct contrast to "Yank."

Out of the world that "Yank" knows
little about comes Mildred Douglas,
played by Catherine Crary, a slender,
delicate girl of twenty, with a self
conscious expression of disdainful
superiority, which maddens "Yank,"
who heretofore had found himself
supreme. She, more than Paddy, is in
exact contrast to the brutish Hairy
Ape. In Mildred's own sphere of society

is her aunt, who is her opposite in
lype, a pompous, proud and fat old
! lady, a type, even to the point of a
double chin and lorgnette. They -ire
two incongrous, artificial, figures, inert
i and disharmonious, as different as they
| can be, on the cool promenade deck of
the ship, from the beast-like men be
| low in the stoke-hole.
Among the minor characters one
■ finds contrasts as great. Nothing could
! be more different than the group of
; shouting, cursing, laughing, singing,
drunken stokers in the first scene, and
the New Yorkers on a corner of Fifth
! Avenue in the '50's.
Further additions which have been
made to the cast by Harold Helvenston,
j director, are: Mina Hughes, Lawrence
Clark, Harvey Hall, Fred Long, and
i Waldo Salt.

"The Hairy Ape," by Eugene O'Neill,
offers a wide variety of contrasts in
the leading roles. First is the contrast
between "Yank," about whom the ac
tion and theme of the play revolves,
and Paddy, mates in the firemen's fore
castle of a transatlantic liner. "Yank,"
interpreted by Peter Heiser, is broader,
fiercer, more truculent, more powerful,
more sure of himself, than all the rest
of the stokers. His superior strength is
respected, with the grudging respect of
fear, to be sure. He represents their

most highly dveloped civilization, but
something which civilization left be
hind, a veritable missing link. He can
not find his place on earth, once it is
shown him that he doesn't belong.

Paddy, played by Carl Cartwright. is
recognizable enough; he is a little
wizened old Irishman, exhibiting the
sad, patient pathos of a monkey. He is
a dreaming sentimentalist to the core,
in direct contrast to "Yank."

Out of the world that "Yank" knows
little about comes Mildred Douglas,
played by Catherine Crary, a slender,
delicate girl of twenty, with a self
conscious expression of disdainful
superiority, which maddens "Yank,"
who heretofore had found himself
supreme. She, more than Paddy, is in
exact contrast to the brutish Hairy
Ape. In Mildred's own sphere of society

is her aunt, who is her opposite in
lype, a pompous, proud and fat old
! lady, a type, even to the point of a
double chin and lorgnette. They -ire
two incongrous, artificial, figures, inert
i and disharmonious, as different as they
| can be, on the cool promenade deck of
the ship, from the beast-like men be
| low in the stoke-hole.
Among the minor characters one
■ finds contrasts as great. Nothing could
! be more different than the group of
; shouting, cursing, laughing, singing,
drunken stokers in the first scene, and
the New Yorkers on a corner of Fifth
! Avenue in the '50's.
Further additions which have been
made to the cast by Harold Helvenston,
j director, are: Mina Hughes, Lawrence
Clark, Harvey Hall, Fred Long, and
i Waldo Salt.
