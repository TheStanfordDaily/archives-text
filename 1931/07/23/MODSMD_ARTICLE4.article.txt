# Wisconsin Has New Admission Plan Says Higby
## Students Must Register 1.7 Lower Division Average 
### 
i
With autumn semester registration at
the University of Wisconsin will be in
stituted a new plan of admission into
third-year work, as well as more rigor
ous requirements for entrance into the
university itself. According to Dr.
! Chester P. Higby, acting professor of
i history from the University of Wiscon
sin, at the end of the first two years an
| average of 1.7 will be required of all
i students who wish to continue into tiie
; third and fourth years.
This is expected to eliminate a large
j number of students after two years of
i work. However, the first fifteen per
| cent of those below 1.7 may make ap
j plication to the committee, and the
leases will be reviewed individually with
I an eye to admittance for further study.
Comprehensive Examinations Required
In addition to ordinary class examin
| ations, students will be required to
! pass comprehensive examinations in
two languages to show an ability to
read and write those languages.
When a student is admitted to what
corresponds to Stanford's upper divi
j sion, he doesn't specialize in a depart
ment, such as history, but in a more
inclusive department, as social sciences.
However, groups of subjects are split
! into smaller groups, and one majors
| not in history, but in American history,
■| or European history.
Besides the requirements of his par
j ticular group, one will have to take
I classes outside.
Will Encourage Able Students
At the end of the four years' course
I students have to pass a comprehensive
, examination in all the work they have
j completed to show power and capacity.
| "Just units won't graduate one," Hirjby
i remarked.
There is included in the plan a pro
| vision by which the most capable stu
j dents will be able to get a Master's de-
I grce at the end of a semester instead of
j at the end of an additional year, with-
I out any reduction in the amoun oi
work.

"The idea," Higby stated, "is to en
courage students of ability to take more
advanced work."
