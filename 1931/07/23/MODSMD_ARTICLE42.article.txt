# "YOUNG GERMANY" IS TITLE OF DR. HOOPS' INTRODUCTORY TALK
## Will Compare Pre-War Times With Conditions At Present 
### 
"Young Germany" will be the sub
ject of the first of a series of five lec
tures to be given in English by Dr.
Reinald Hoops, professor of German
from the University of Glasgow. The
lectures will be given at 8 o'clock on
successive Monday evenings in the
Little Theatre, the first being scheduled
for next Monday, July 27.

Dr. Hoops' main point will be to
show the difference between pre-war
Germany and the Germany of today, a
Germany wrongly conceived of in ihe
minds of the people in other countries.
"The world doesn't realize the change
which has taken place in Germany in
Ihc past decade and a half," Dr. Hoops
told a reporter.
Will Discuss Youth Movement
"The Youth Movement in Germany
in 1923," how it came about, what its
aims were, and the part it has played
in developing the Germany of today,
will be a high point in the lecture. The
Movement, which had a drastic in

brought new ideas into German life,
according to the lecturer.
Dr. Hoops was a student at the Uni
versity of Berlin and at Heidelberg,
where his father is a famous professor
of Anglistics, and a friend of Jacob
Schurman, former Ambassador to Ger
many. He is descended from a long
line of scientists and internationalists.
On Monday he gave a lecture before
the luncheon meeting of the San Fran

Women's City Club, on "The Germany

Will Use Lantern Slides
"The moratorium of Hoover was the
only thing which could save Germany.
But it was held up too long to keep the
worst of things from happening in Ger
many. Everything now depends on the
loan and the improvement of condi
tions through it."
In his lectures at Stanford Dr. Hoops
will discuss "Modern German Archi
tecture," "German Education," "De
scriptive Germany," and "Oberammer
gau." Lantern slides which he brought
with him from Glasgow will be used
to illustrate the Oberammergau lecture.
