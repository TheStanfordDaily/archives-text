# MONEY STILL NEEDED TO FINISH FURNISHING OF ROBLE GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Roble Gymnasium is still far from
being completely furnished. Last quar
ter it was estimated that $20,000 would
be needed for equiment, and approxi
mately $5,000 was raised by women stu
dents and various Stanford clubs, in
cluding the Mothers' Club, the Faculty
Club, and the Stanford Dames.

While the Girls' Lounge, the waiting
rooms of Dr. Bertha S. Dyment, direc
tor of physical education for women,
and the dance studio have been par
tially equipped, none of the staff of
fices or the libary are. Also mediral
apparatus is needed, and new tennis
courts. The courts, however, wex - e no"
included in the original estimate, and
Dr. Dyment says that it will be neces
sary to raise this amount in addition
to the $15,000 needed to complete the
interior of the gymnasium. It was er
roneously reported in the Daily recent
ly that only $700 had to be raised.

No plans have been made for obtain
ing this money, but according to Dr.
Dyment, as soon as the fall quarter be
gins, a drive for funds will be started.
