# AVIATION SCHOOL NOT AFFECTED BY MUNICIPAL AIRPORT

### 
The proposed Palo Alto municipal
airport will not affect the Palo Alto
School of Aviation, according to A. W.
Gorman, manager of the field.

"Most of the business of the field is
from the outside," declared Gorman.
"Our greatest source of revenue results
from work in our repair shops and
aerial photography, the latter extend
ing over a large territory."
The aviation school, which is dis
tributor for Fleet planes, plans to ex
pand sales on a large scale. A salesman
is kept "in the air" selling airships and
soliciting business for the field. Gor
man said his organization is one of
three in Northern California approved
as repair depots by the Department of
Commerce.
Much aerial photography is done in
Palo Alto planes, while a pilot recently
returned from an eight weeks' photo
graphing expedition in the state of
Washington.
"An especially commendable situa
tion in regard to instruction at the Palo
Alto School of Aviation," said Gorman,
"is that since the establishment of the
school there has never been an acci
dent of any kind. Capable instructors
and modern, well-kept equipment, to
gether with a careful inspection pro
gram, are responsible for this situation."
