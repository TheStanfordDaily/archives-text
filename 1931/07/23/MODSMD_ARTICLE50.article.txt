# BAKUNIN, ANARCHIST, TOPIC OF VERNADSKY LECTURE ON TUESDAY
## Yale Man, Professor Russian History, Will Speak at Little Theatre 
### 
"Bakunin: Apostle of Anarchism," is
the subject on which Professor George
Vernadsky of Yale University and pro
fessor of Russian History at Stanford
this summer, will lecture next Tuesday
evening in the Little Theatre.

Professor Vernadsky, who was born
in Russia and taught school in Petro
grad, went to Greece in 1920 and from
there moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia,
where he was professor of the history
of Russian law for five years. He came
to this country in 1927 and has been
professor at Yale ever since.

Bakunin, son of a Russian nobleman,
was born in 1814 and during his youth
became interested in German philo
sophy which caused him to become
conservative in his political opinions.
He left Russia in 1840 and went to
France where he became associated
with a revolutionary group.
As one of the founders of anarchism
Bakunin added many points to their
theories by attacking not only the
bourgeoise but also the state. In France
he became an exponent of the labor
movement and joined with Carl Marx
as a leader in the first International,
but because of differences between the
two it soon disorganized.
Bakunin is important not only be
cause of his theoretical ideas but also
as a personality of intensive revolu
tionary ardor. He was an active leader
in the revolutions of 1848 and 1849 and
was also connected in 1864 with the
Polish uprising against Russia.

Ivan Turgenev, the great Russian
author and also a dear friend and ad
mirer of Bakunin, in 1855 wrote the
book, "Rudin," in which he attempts
to picture the character of Bakunin.
