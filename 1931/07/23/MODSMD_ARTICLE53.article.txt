# COLORFUL PAJAMAS ARE LATE FASHION IN ROBLE REVELRY
## 
### 
Since Dame Fashion has decreed
that pajamas are the vogue, Roble Hall
last night staged a pajama party.

The colors and style were as varied
as the girls thus attired, and after mu
tual admiration subsided, everyone set
tled down to enjoy the program ar
ranged by Helen Kleffman, chairman,
and Marian Osborn and Ada Annabel
The first number was a musical skit,
"Tell Me Pretty Maiden," featuring
Mabel Griffiths and Louise Stewart.
Dorothy Bernhardt played the piano
accompaniment.
Mary Anita Loos entertained by
singing "Dark Eyes," in Russian, and
Mabel Pruitt gave a gi'oup of readings.
Her numbers were "Food for Gossip,"
"I Doubt It," and 'Spring Gardening."

Following the program everyone
scrambled for marshmallows and sticks,
vieing with one another in producing
the most delectable toasted marshmal
lows. Afterwards Stanford and other
college songs were sung, until the Jogs
burned down.
