# STUDY PUN HERE "MILD" ACCORDING TO E. E. ROBINSON
## Chicago and Wisconsin Effect Educational Changes 
### 
That the independent study plan at
Stanford is mild compared to the
changes which have been put into effect
at Chicago and Wisconsin is the belief
of Professor E. E. Robinson, professor
of American History and director of
Citizenship at Stanford, who spoke at
the Men's Education Club yesterday
noon.
Professor Robinson, who recently re
turned from a meeting of the Institute
of Administrative Officers at Chicago,
stated that while the West is progres
sive in many educational matters, the
universities of Chicago and Wisconsin
have taken the most radical steps so
far as higher education is concerned.
Stanford Plan Started in 1!)25
Of especial interest to the school men
assembled was Professor Robinson's ex
planation of Stanford's independent
study plan. It was pointed out that the
plan, which came as the result of the
report of a committee organized in the
faculty, was inaugurated in 1925. He
explained that, contrary to the opinion
of many, this plan does not affect die
curriculum in any way; only the pro
gram of the individual student is af
fected.

Since the change has been in effect,
it was stated, thirty-nine students have
graduated under the plan. Of the thir
ty-nine, only twenty-five have been
graduated with distinction. '"This shows
that the standards have not been re
laxed," the speaker said. Twenty-one
of the thirty-nine have gone into
graduate work.
Standards Not Relaxed
Pointing out that the slow growth of
the plan indicates that there are some
faults in it, Professor Robinson de
elared that "there are two main criti
cisms, namely, that it overburdens the !
faculty and that the students are not ,
ready for it. Other objections are often |
heard but they come mostly from those i
who are not interested in education." |
Professor Robinson concluded by ex- j
plaining that the General Education |
Hoard has granted the University a j
fund to enable it to carry out fur- I
ther experiments with the Independent !
Study Plan. He explained that, whereas j
under the former working of the sys- ;
tem a student could begin doing inde- I
pendent study in his junior year, the j
plan will be put into operation during j
the coming year in freshman courses -
in citizenship,, history, psychology, eco- j
nomics, political science, English com- \
position, and possibly others.
Will Experiment Further
A ecrtain number of each class will
be chosen, and these students will be •
(.'xcusod from regular classwork at the 1
end of the first month and allowed to
work independently. This system will
be in the form of a controlled experi
ment and from it, Professor Robinson
declared, the committee hopes to ob
tain some valuable conclusions as to
methods and results.
The Phi Delta Kappa quartet sang
two numbers. W. L. Iverson was chair
man. It was announced that the school i
men from Oregon will have charge of j
the meeting next Wednesday.

That the independent study plan at
Stanford is mild compared to the
changes which have been put into effect
at Chicago and Wisconsin is the belief
of Professor E. E. Robinson, professor
of American History and director of
Citizenship at Stanford, who spoke at
the Men's Education Club yesterday
noon.
Professor Robinson, who recently re
turned from a meeting of the Institute
of Administrative Officers at Chicago,
stated that while the West is progres
sive in many educational matters, the
universities of Chicago and Wisconsin
have taken the most radical steps so
far as higher education is concerned.
Stanford Plan Started in 1!)25
Of especial interest to the school men
assembled was Professor Robinson's ex
planation of Stanford's independent
study plan. It was pointed out that the
plan, which came as the result of the
report of a committee organized in the
faculty, was inaugurated in 1925. He
explained that, contrary to the opinion
of many, this plan does not affect die
curriculum in any way; only the pro
gram of the individual student is af
fected.

Since the change has been in effect,
it was stated, thirty-nine students have
graduated under the plan. Of the thir
ty-nine, only twenty-five have been
graduated with distinction. '"This shows
that the standards have not been re
laxed," the speaker said. Twenty-one
of the thirty-nine have gone into
graduate work.
Standards Not Relaxed

the plan indicates that there are some
faults in it, Professor Robinson de

Pointing out that the slow growth of
the plan indicates that there are some
faults in it, Professor Robinson de
elared that "there are two main criti
cisms, namely, that it overburdens the !
faculty and that the students are not ,
ready for it. Other objections are often |
heard but they come mostly from those i
who are not interested in education." |
Professor Robinson concluded by ex- j
plaining that the General Education |
Hoard has granted the University a j
fund to enable it to carry out fur- I
ther experiments with the Independent !
Study Plan. He explained that, whereas j
under the former working of the sys- ;
tem a student could begin doing inde- I
pendent study in his junior year, the j
plan will be put into operation during j
the coming year in freshman courses -
in citizenship,, history, psychology, eco- j
nomics, political science, English com- \
position, and possibly others.
Will Experiment Further
A ecrtain number of each class will
be chosen, and these students will be •
