# MONTEUX WINS PLAUDITS FROM HEARERS SUNDAY
## Orchestra Joins In Applause; Given Conductor At End Of Concert "Scheherazade" And French Compositions Please Large Crowd 
### 
Orchestra and audience joined Sun
day in applauding Pierre Monteu.v,
who conducted the sixth summer con
cert of the symphony orchestra at
Hillsborough. The gonial Frenchman
was called to the front of the platform
several times at the conclusion, and
there generously shared the acclaim
with the orchestra.
From the reception given to the pro
gram, it was difficult to tell whether
the Debussy Nocturnes, Ravel's "La
Valse," or the "Scheherazade" suite by
Rimsky-Korsakoff was the most popu
lar. Under the precise baton of Mon
teux cach piece, not to omit Berlioz's
Overture to "Benvenuto Cellini," which
opened the concert, was a revelation of
exquisite charm. Never has the orches
tra seemed more to reflect the person
ality of a conductor than it did Sunday.
Directing without the aid of a score,
Monteux seemed intent on drawing out
of cach number all that it contained
of musical worth.
Berlioz Overture Colorful
The overture to "Benvenuto Cellini"
is the opening music to an opera of
the same name. While the opera has
never been a success, this overture and
the introduction to the second act, the
"Roman Carnival," played in Sir Ham
ilton Harty's program a few weeks ago,
have become standard concert pieces.
The music, dashing and colorful, re
flects not only the dashing hero of the
opera, but Ihe picturesque background
of the Rome oi the sixteenth century.
The two Nocturnes by Claude Debussy,
Clouds and "Festivals," drew' gasps
of admiration from the audience by
their exquisite beauty. The light, fra
gile quality of the former is a musical
picture of clouds moving slowly across
the sky, constantly changing and dis-
solving. The "Festivals" movement is
one of movement and rhythm, the ac
tual atmosphere of a festival or carni
val, with all of its color and clashing
noises. Cleverly worked into the piece
is a movement intended to portray a
procession that passes through the fes
tival and at the same time blends with
is easy to see whence Monteux's
fame as an interpreter of "modern
music" after hearing these Nocturnes
Sunday.
Ravel's Music Wins Audience
The work of another modern French
composer, this time Ravel's "La Valse,"
concluded the first part of the concert.
Again the audience was held tense by
Monteux's interpretation. This music
evidently describes a grand ball, open
ing with a w&ltz strain of beauty and
grace. The / music becomes frenzied,
drunken with excitement. Then there
is a threatening heard, a rumbling of
the basses and brasses. The bacchana
lian revels take on a sinister meaning.
As one critic wrote of the piece, it is
as if someone, seeing the revels, ex
claimed, "We are dancing on a vol
cano." And this warning of decay or
dissolution continues, expressed by dis
sonances and shock of timbres, espe
cially the repeated combinations in
which the strings grate against the
brass.
"La Valse' had its first American
performance by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra under Alfred
Hertz, October 28, 1921.
The second half of the program was
taken up with the Symphonic Suite,
"Scheherazade"' by Rimsky-KorsakofT.
According to the program notes, "This
opulent, richly melodic and flamingly
colored oriental suite is a daring and
brilliant attempt to translate into music
some of the tales told Sultan Shahriar
by the Sultana Scheherazade in the
"Arabian Nights."
Suite Depicts Several Stories
While the stories portrayed by the
music are disconnected, a single theme,
played by the solo violin, ties them
together. This theme is meant to repre
sent Scheherazade herself telling the
story.
Probably the most memorable of the
movements are the third one, a "ro
manza" that introduces the story of
"The Young Prince and the Young
Princess," and the final one of the
shipwreck. One hears the merrymaking
and dancing, the ominous warning,
thundered out by the trombones, and
finally the crash of the storm-driven
vessel against the magnetic rocks.
When all is serene once more, the mo
tive of the Scheherazade appears again.
Alexander Smallens, who will con
duct the two final concerts of the sea
son, will appear with the orchestra next
Sunday.

Berlioz Overture Colorful
The overture to "Benvenuto Cellini"
is the opening music to an opera of
the same name. While the opera has
never been a success, this overture and
the introduction to the second act, the
"Roman Carnival," played in Sir Ham
ilton Harty's program a few weeks ago,
have become standard concert pieces.
The music, dashing and colorful, re
flects not only the dashing hero of the
opera, but Ihe picturesque background
of the Rome oi the sixteenth century.
The two Nocturnes by Claude Debussy,
Clouds and "Festivals," drew' gasps
of admiration from the audience by
their exquisite beauty. The light, fra
gile quality of the former is a musical
picture of clouds moving slowly across
the sky, constantly changing and dis-
solving. The "Festivals" movement is
one of movement and rhythm, the ac
tual atmosphere of a festival or carni
val, with all of its color and clashing
noises. Cleverly worked into the piece

Ravel's Music Wins Audience
The work of another modern French
composer, this time Ravel's "La Valse,"
concluded the first part of the concert.
Again the audience was held tense by
Monteux's interpretation. This music
evidently describes a grand ball, open
ing with a w&ltz strain of beauty and
grace. The / music becomes frenzied,
drunken with excitement. Then there
is a threatening heard, a rumbling of
the basses and brasses. The bacchana
lian revels take on a sinister meaning.
As one critic wrote of the piece, it is
as if someone, seeing the revels, ex
claimed, "We are dancing on a vol
cano." And this warning of decay or
dissolution continues, expressed by dis
sonances and shock of timbres, espe
cially the repeated combinations in
which the strings grate against the
brass.
"La Valse' had its first American
performance by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra under Alfred
Hertz, October 28, 1921.
The second half of the program was
taken up with the Symphonic Suite,
"Scheherazade"' by Rimsky-KorsakofT.
According to the program notes, "This
opulent, richly melodic and flamingly
colored oriental suite is a daring and
brilliant attempt to translate into music
some of the tales told Sultan Shahriar
by the Sultana Scheherazade in the
"Arabian Nights."
Suite Depicts Several Stories
While the stories portrayed by the
music are disconnected, a single theme,
played by the solo violin, ties them
together. This theme is meant to repre
sent Scheherazade herself telling the
story.
Probably the most memorable of the
movements are the third one, a "ro
manza" that introduces the story of
"The Young Prince and the Young
Princess," and the final one of the
shipwreck. One hears the merrymaking
and dancing, the ominous warning,
thundered out by the trombones, and
finally the crash of the storm-driven
vessel against the magnetic rocks.
When all is serene once more, the mo
tive of the Scheherazade appears again.

tival and at the same time blends with
is easy to see whence Monteux's
fame as an interpreter of "modern
music" after hearing these Nocturnes
Sunday.
Ravel's Music Wins Audience
The work of another modern French
composer, this time Ravel's "La Valse,"
concluded the first part of the concert.
Again the audience was held tense by
Monteux's interpretation. This music
evidently describes a grand ball, open
ing with a w&ltz strain of beauty and
grace. The / music becomes frenzied,
drunken with excitement. Then there
is a threatening heard, a rumbling of
the basses and brasses. The bacchana
lian revels take on a sinister meaning.
As one critic wrote of the piece, it is
as if someone, seeing the revels, ex
claimed, "We are dancing on a vol
cano." And this warning of decay or
dissolution continues, expressed by dis
sonances and shock of timbres, espe
cially the repeated combinations in
which the strings grate against the
brass.
"La Valse' had its first American
performance by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra under Alfred
Hertz, October 28, 1921.
The second half of the program was
taken up with the Symphonic Suite,
"Scheherazade"' by Rimsky-KorsakofT.
According to the program notes, "This
opulent, richly melodic and flamingly
colored oriental suite is a daring and
brilliant attempt to translate into music
some of the tales told Sultan Shahriar
by the Sultana Scheherazade in the
"Arabian Nights."
Suite Depicts Several Stories
While the stories portrayed by the
music are disconnected, a single theme,
played by the solo violin, ties them
together. This theme is meant to repre
sent Scheherazade herself telling the
story.
Probably the most memorable of the
movements are the third one, a "ro
manza" that introduces the story of
"The Young Prince and the Young
Princess," and the final one of the
shipwreck. One hears the merrymaking
and dancing, the ominous warning,
thundered out by the trombones, and
finally the crash of the storm-driven
vessel against the magnetic rocks.
When all is serene once more, the mo
tive of the Scheherazade appears again.
Alexander Smallens, who will con
duct the two final concerts of the sea
son, will appear with the orchestra next
Sunday.
