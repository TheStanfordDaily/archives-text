want to be young and we arc going to be. We are praying for a new era,"
said Dr. Reinald Hoops, in interpreting the spirit of German youth in the '
beginning of the present century, as he described the Youth Movement in his
lecture in the Little Theatre last night. "Leaders of this movement set out to
be young, to start afresh, to live and not merely to vegetate, and not to imitate
the corrupt, stuffy lives of their parents," he went on, in his explanation of the
movement and its far-reaching and permanent effects on the life and spirit of
the country. Tourists, he pointed out, wouldn't see the subtle changes in spirit

which have taken place since the war, a
outer changes in architectural styles, am

dthough they would be able to perceive
[1 improvements in public facilities, sucli
as parks and schools, especially in the
big cities.
These fundamental and far-reaching
changes in spirit are not dated from
the end of the war, as so many things
are. They were accelerated by the war,
to be sure, but were noticeable even
before in th Youth Movement which
had its beginnings as early as 1900.
This so-called Youth Movement,
which was one of the biggest and most
sweeping movements of modern times;
seized the nation and has, at the height
of its day, the whole say in the trans
formation of the entire nation. The
movement, as a movement, has passed
away, but it has left a deep impres
sion, Hoops explained.
It had both a destructive and a con
structive side, he said. Destructively, it
fought the older generation, and sought
to destroy the attitude of parents toward
youh and went so far as to criticize
the entertainments and existing institu
tions built up by the preceding genera
tions, Constructively, the Youth Move
ment made a definite effort to create a
new life and a new nation.
"What the youth of Germany actually
did to realize their ideals was to leave
the cities, where they found only false
living, and to walk through the coun
tryside, singing the old German folk
songs, and dancing the folk dances.
They were happy in a clean and na
tural way," Hoops .related.
This Youth Movement, which was at
its height between the years of 1919
and .1923, died out only after it had
acquired the things for which it was
fighting. Its accomplishments, as in
terpreted by Dr. Hoops, were four:
The young generation in Germany has,
as a result of the movement, a sense for
the beauties of nature and for the
pleasure gathered from living. They
have, furthermore, a desire and a sense
for simplicity in their way of living.
While the movement was in its hey
dey, they refused to eat canned food
or to ride instead of walk. A third
valuable outcome was the rediscovery
of old folksongs and folk dances. More
over, the youth of Germany came to
take life seriously.
Today in Germany the men who are
in the professions, or in other respon
sible positions in the affairs of the
country, were a part of the youth
movement at one time or another, and
are in sympathy with the new spirit
and ideals, Hoops declared.
"We want to understand each other,
we nations, and to sec what we have
in common, to work for real power, to
help the advance of the human cause,"
he concluded.

"What the youth of Germany actually
did to realize their ideals was to leave
the cities, where they found only false
living, and to walk through the coun
tryside, singing the old German folk
songs, and dancing the folk dances.
They were happy in a clean and na
tural way," Hoops .related.
This Youth Movement, which was at
its height between the years of 1919
and .1923, died out only after it had
acquired the things for which it was
fighting. Its accomplishments, as in
terpreted by Dr. Hoops, were four:
The young generation in Germany has,
as a result of the movement, a sense for
the beauties of nature and for the
pleasure gathered from living. They
have, furthermore, a desire and a sense
for simplicity in their way of living.
While the movement was in its hey
dey, they refused to eat canned food
or to ride instead of walk. A third
valuable outcome was the rediscovery
of old folksongs and folk dances. More
over, the youth of Germany came to
take life seriously.
Today in Germany the men who are
in the professions, or in other respon
sible positions in the affairs of the
country, were a part of the youth
movement at one time or another, and
are in sympathy with the new spirit
and ideals, Hoops declared.
"We want to understand each other,
we nations, and to sec what we have
in common, to work for real power, to
help the advance of the human cause,"
he concluded.

want to be young and we arc going to be. We are praying for a new era,"
said Dr. Reinald Hoops, in interpreting the spirit of German youth in the '
beginning of the present century, as he described the Youth Movement in his
lecture in the Little Theatre last night. "Leaders of this movement set out to
be young, to start afresh, to live and not merely to vegetate, and not to imitate
the corrupt, stuffy lives of their parents," he went on, in his explanation of the
movement and its far-reaching and permanent effects on the life and spirit of
the country. Tourists, he pointed out, wouldn't see the subtle changes in spirit

which have taken place since the war, a
outer changes in architectural styles, am

dthough they would be able to perceive
[1 improvements in public facilities, sucli
as parks and schools, especially in the
big cities.
These fundamental and far-reaching
changes in spirit are not dated from
the end of the war, as so many things
are. They were accelerated by the war,
to be sure, but were noticeable even
before in th Youth Movement which
had its beginnings as early as 1900.
This so-called Youth Movement,
which was one of the biggest and most
sweeping movements of modern times;
seized the nation and has, at the height
of its day, the whole say in the trans
formation of the entire nation. The
movement, as a movement, has passed
away, but it has left a deep impres
sion, Hoops explained.
It had both a destructive and a con
structive side, he said. Destructively, it
fought the older generation, and sought
to destroy the attitude of parents toward
youh and went so far as to criticize
the entertainments and existing institu
tions built up by the preceding genera
