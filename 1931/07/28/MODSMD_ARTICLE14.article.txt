# SHELDON TO TALK AT MEN'S DINNER
## Education Luncheon Club To Hear U. Of Oregon Dean 
### 
Dr. H. D. Sheldon, dean of the school
of education at the University of Ore
gon and acting professor of education
at Stanford this summer, will speak at
the Men's Education Luncheon Club,
Wednesday. School men of Oregon
have charge of the program.
K. W. Onthank, assistant registrar of
the University of Oregon, who has
charge of the program, announces that
a special musical program has been
prepared.
Although Dr. Sheldon's topic has not
been announced, it is probable that his
talk will include something concerning
the Stanford of 1931 and the Stanford
of 189(5. Dr. Sheldon was graduated
from the University on that date, in
the same class with President Hoover.
