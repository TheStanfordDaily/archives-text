"Sl;ir light, s(ar liri^lit.
First star I've seen tonight.
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my wish come true tonight."
Superstitious? "Certainly not," is the !
' invariable reply on the Stanford cam- 1
pus, but how many instinctively I
breathe the above prayer when seeing !
the first star again for fear they will j
break the spell.
On searching further one finds that I
| most everyone has his little pet super- j
| stition. Probably the' most popular one ]
among the men is aversion to lighting j
| three cigarettes with one match, as it's j
i bound to sever friendship.
Co-eds Have Superstitions
In the dining room at Roble salt is j
never spilt unless someone calls "throw i
i some over your left shoulder or there J
! will be a fight." It is slill a favorite
I trick among the girls to burn matches {
J down entirely in their hands to see |
, whether their sweethearts are true to '
I them. I
One of (he women students is swear- j
! ing that the reason her hanging book- !
I case has fallen down three times is be- J
[cause there was a pot of Wandering |

Jew sitting on top of it. This is sup
posed to bring bad luck to any house
hold.
There is another girl on the campus
I who firmly contends that "Dead Eye
: Dick," a battered straw doll, which she
j has carried in her car ever since she
drove an automobile, is her guardian
' angel of the highways. Another one has
! a rabbit's foot hanging in her room to
| bring good luck and help pass exams.
Disbelievers Still Superstitious
j Even one of the most ardent dis
! believers in superstitions, who intel
! lectually is far superior to such triviali
! tics, was noticed the other day refusing
J to dry her hands on a towel with an
j other person or there would be a quar
| rel. Maybe it was because of hygienic
! reasons, but friends doubt it.
Though Stanford students don't be
lieve in power of the superstitions they
!do not like to incur the disfavor of
! Lady Luck by walking under ladders,
having black cats cross their path,
I opening umbrellas in the house, or
| breaking mirrors; and when chick mi is
servod at the dining halls, everyone
I reaches for the wishbone. Supersti
