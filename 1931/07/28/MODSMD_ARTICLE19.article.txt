### 
"Bakunin: Apostle of Anarchism" is
the subject of the lecture which will
be given by Professor George Ver
nadsky of Yale University in the Little
Theatre at 8 o'clock tonight. Professor
Vernadsky is on the Stanford summer
faculty as a professor of Russian his
tory.

The personality, life, and program of
Bakunin will be discussed by the lec
turer, who intends to present the revo
lutionary figure as a background for
Lenin's program. Bakunin, who clashed
with Karl Marx, would have clashed
also with Lenin, according to Professor
Vernadsky, who will present the points
of divergence and Ihe points of simi
larity obtained by a comparison of the
two men. Professor Vernadsky is the
author of a book on Lenin, published
by the Yale University Press.

Bakunin, a figure of the nineteenth
century, was one of the founders of
| anarchismâ€”a man who opposed a con-
I tralized state. He is important for his
i theoretical ideas and for his intensive
j personality as a revolutionist. Bakunin
was the son of a Russian nobleman and
! was, as a young man, conservative in
i his politics and interested in German
i philosophy. When he left Russia in 1840
jhe joined a revolutionary group in
I France, and became involved in the
! labor movement; he joined Karl Marx
j in the first International, but the (wo
| leaders clashed and disorganization foJ
' lowed.
Bakunin was a leader in the revolu
tions of 1848 and 1849 and was con
nected with the Polish uprising against
; Russia in 1864.
Professor Vernadsky was born in
| Russia and has lived in Petrograd,
j Greece, and Prague. In Prague he was
j professor of the history of Russian law
; for five years. He has been in the
i United States since 1927, as a professor
; at Yale.
This lecture is one of the regular
| Tuesday evening series, in which mem-
I bers of the histox - y department are
I speaking on important historical
j figures.
