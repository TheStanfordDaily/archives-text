# TOYON'S INFANT NUISANCES
## 
### 
The Stanford spirit, according to Dr. David Starr Jordan, is
acting the part ol' a gentleman at all times.
1 A few freshmen living in Tovon Hall are either ignorant of
how a gentleman acts, or they are unwilling to exhibit decent
courtesy. During the summer session Ihey are guests in the
home of upper-division students, and as guests, should respect
the hall regulations that have been passed by men far wiser
in the ways of college life than they.
The exploding of black powder bombs during tin 4 week of
mid-quarters is a childish prank, the dumping of laundry cans
full of water down stairways and into rooms is infantile; the
continuance of such annoyances is idiotic.

The requests of older Tovon men to quiet down were an
swered with vile phrases, more numerous explosions, a raspy
tenor, noisy radios, and donkey-like bravings. The actions of
these freshmen shows what Ihey are more clearly than could a
column of description. The fact that Saturday night, when re
strictions are removed as far as noise is concerned, the samel
sort of performance aroused not one complaint, is proof that i
the regular Tovon men are not excessive in their demands.
Freshmen who either cannot or will not act as a gentleman
does, with consideration for the feelings of others who arc
forced to associate with them, do not belong in Stanford.
By continuing such actions Ihey can make sure that many
of the hall men, whose companionship they have imposed upon,
will hope that they will not enroll here for the fall quarter.
