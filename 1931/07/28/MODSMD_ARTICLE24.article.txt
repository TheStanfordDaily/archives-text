The other day a student, his eyes full of sleep, shambled!
toward the Quad from the general direction of the Library. I
T'pon reaching the steps whqre the disputatious are wont to
gather, he complained that the seats in the reserve room of
the Library were so comfortable that instead of studying he
always got sleepy.
Now here is a situation that needs looking into. Is it possible j
that the benevolent authorities in their effort to provide us with
equipment that will make our work more tolerable have gone i
too far? Perhaps by thus providing rest for our bodies they have |
unwittingly defeated the very purpose of the institution, and
softened the fibres of bur minds.

Well, the situation is not beyond repair. To begin with, i;
would be well to abandon all the chairs with backs iu them and
substitute benches instead. Only books with fine print should
be used; one would have to be fullv awake to read them. If these
changes are not productive of better intellectual results, one
other means is possible—require that all students wear hair
shirts.
