"Look out, world! Mere I come! For four venrs in college I
sluill have to bottle up my sarcasm and destructive force, while
I study to he a dramatic critic, then woe to the lirst play i attack
if 1 am given a free rein!"
This response, received bv a San Francisco newspaper which
is interviewing high-school honor student graduates regarding
their ambitions, is illustrative of the eagerness of this girl to he
damning in her critcisms. 11 is likewise the common attitude of
college students to find nothng hut fault in their critical com
mentations, he it on literature, art, politics, or what not.
Yet this same girl says, ". . . . later I expect to write the
world's best novel." In the back of her mind she is planning on
doing some building up as well as some tearing down. This,
too, is a common urge behind the thought of college youth.
Youth can be so uncompromisingly critical—and still is so
fundamentally constructive. Progress can thank her lucky stars
that it is so.
