# IT WOULD BE NICE

I he San Francisco Chronicle points out that more humor is
found in the news reports than on the comic sheet. Attempting
to illustrate, it made the following observation:
"King Carol of Rumania has ordered the Minister of War
to admit Crown Prince Michael to the army air school. Wouldn't
it be glorious if some of us could order our sons ami daughters
admitted to Stanford t Diversity in this grandiose manner?"
Yes, and wouldn't it he nice if we could order the Stanford
tuition paid out of the royal treasury, too?
