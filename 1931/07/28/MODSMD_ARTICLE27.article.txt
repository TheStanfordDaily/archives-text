CHILDREN OF DREAMS—At the
Varsity Theatre.
There is only one excuse for this all
i singing production and even that is a
i bit shaky at times—Margaret Schil
ling's voice. Every other major element
that goes to make up the show is a bit
"out of older."
\ The plot is worn out: poor little rich
girl takes leave of absence from lover
| to follow the path to glory and wealth
! only to discover that it doesn't lead to
happiness; thai is, love is greater than
i a career.
The settings are artificial; at leas!,
I slightly unreal: happy, singing "fruit
l gypsies" gaily picking apples all day
J long and doing folk-steps in the
'I orchard rows all night by (ho light of
J Japanese lanterns.
The songs: the producers evidently
, realized they had one good number
and abused it so much and so often
I that it had grown tiresome before we
l really learned to like it.
The impression created: that the
I apple-pickers of Watsonville spend the
! winter season attending Ihe Opera in
' New York.

HUSH MONEY—At Ihe New Stanford
Theatre.
If a "semi-gang" show can be called
"good clean fun," that phrase might
well characterize this production. The
j crook plot is just a background for
| quite funny settings and clever re
partee. Joan Bennett alleviates any
1 sordidness that should, by all prece
j dent, accompany a picture of this typo.
She is cast as a poor "down-and
outer" who seeks the easiest way out
of acute financial embarrassment, un
consciously aids in a couple of crooked
deals, is caught, and pays her penalty
I to society with a year in prison. On
being released she maks a new bid for
happiness, marries, and lives peacefully
I for five years. Then her crook accom
i plices finish their terms, look her up,
and demand "hush money." The ex
pected ending is brought about in an
i unexpected manner.
Douglass Cosgrove, as Inspector of
Detectives, does a very nice piece of
i work.
