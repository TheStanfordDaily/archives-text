THE FIRE IN HEART â€” Translated
from the German of Franz VVerfel l>\
Geoffrey Dunlop. New York: 'Simon
and Schuster. (At the Palo Alto Hook
Shop.)
The failure of intellect and agnosti
cism to achieve for a man inner balance
and inner vision is Franz Werfel's tar
get in this far-from-idle book of his. '
Ferdinand R., a ship's doctor, looks 1
back upon his own life with the aid of
a powerful and sensitive memory on
which had been registered forever the ;
various shocks of his turbid existence. I
The outstanding relationship in that
life is his spiritual relationship with
old Barbara, the nurse of his child
hood, a relationship so compelling ind
so genuine as to discount blood rela- 1
tionships which had failed him. Bar- 1
bara is real, and at once ideal and a
moving symbol.
Ferdinand himself arouses sympathy, )
admiration, and not a little pity, the
latter because of his loneliness, his j
realness in an unreal world, his spiritu- 1
ality in a universe that is non-spiritual.
About him there is no empty senti- i
mentality and no rank irony.
In spirit and in point of view, Werfel
is likened to Dostoevsky, to whom
everyone who writes a novel about the
spiritual problems of man owes a simi
lar debt. Werfel's book has an almost
unparalleled significance for the people j
of this generation, for it brings order 1
out of the recognized chaos of the mod- j
em world.
