# PROSPECTS REVIEWED AS STUDENTS AWAIT ARRIVAL OF GRIDMEN
## "King Football" Scheduled To Appear September Fifteenth 
### 
With the summer rapidly passing,
thoughts are once more beginning to
turn to "King Football." Days are being
counted until the first pigskin call will
be sounded on September 15, by Pop
Warner. Stanford's possibilities are
being discussed and the material on
hand is receiving a thorough weighing.
The big question seems to be, "Will
Warner be able to replace the valuable
men lost through graduation?"
Twelve lettermen, among them five
regulars, will be missing next fall. The
hardest of these to replace will be Har
low Rothert, plunging fullback; Guido
Caglieri, halfback; Dick Bogue, tackle;
and Perry Taylor, center. The losing
of these men does not end Warner's
woes. Two aditional blows have fallen
since the close of the 10.'IO gridiron cam
paign. Phil MwlTatt, Stanford's greatest
back last season and one of the best
in the country, broke a bone in his ieg
duiing spring practice and has only
recently discarded crutches, lie is still
unable to work out and may not be in
shape for the season.
Eighteen Lettermen Return
Captain-elect Harry Hillman, power
ful plunging quarterback, recently un
derwent a knee operation necessitated
by an injury last year, and may not
be in shape for "the opening of the sea
son. He Ts at present resting and taking
light exercise.
Eighteen lettermen, including six
regulars, are expected to return next
fall. They are: Phil Neill and Bill
Doub, ends; Chuck Ehrhorn, tackle;
Ray Hulen, guard; Captain-elect Harry
Hillman, quarterback, and Phil Moffat,
halfback, as the regulars with Don
Colvin and Carl Wittenau, ends; AI
Hunt, Ray Dawson, and Pete Heiser,
guards; Phil Baker and Ernie Cacldei,
quarterback and fullback; Rudy Rin
tala and Tom Lambert, halfbacks, as
substitutes.
Aside from these men several good
prospects are coming from the Grays
and the frosh. For center there is John
Card, Bill Bates, and John Hancock;
guards, Bill Corbus, Fred Scribner,
Jack White, and Ellison Ebey; tackles,
Gribben, Palamountain, and Tatum;
ends, Walter Todd, a transfer from
Menlo Junior College, and Carlos Mon
salve, captain of the 19110 freshmen;
halfbacks, Tom Glover, Bill Maentz,.
and Morris Oppenheim; and for the
interchangeable positions of quarter
back and fullback, are Jack Hillman,
brother of Harry, and Stan Anderson,
both from last year's frosh squad.
Heavy Schedule Listed
Several valuable men are also re
turning from last year's reserves,
among them: Bill Marks and Norm
McLeod, center; Nelson Gray and
Henri Laborde, tackles; "Dusty"' Allen,
fullback; and Gordon Campbell and
"Spud" Hardy, halfbacks.

Theuo will be little time to get a
working combination together as the
first game is scheduled with the West
Coast Army for September 19, four
days after the opening of practice. The
Cards are slated for eleven games on

successive Saturdays, with three of the
most important contests on foreign soil.
The Indians will meet Washington at
Seattle, October 24, Southern California
at Los Angeles, November 7. and Dart
mouth at Harvard Stadium, Novem
ber 28.
