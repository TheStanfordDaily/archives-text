# LIBERAL EDUCATION IS BEING REPLACED BY SCRAMBLE FOR GRADE POINTS SAYS DAVIDSON
## 
### 
j Publishing student grade averages in
i the "Bawlout" or elsewhere is con
demned by P. E. Davidson, associate
! professor of education, who believes
! that students are unwholesomely grade
[ conscious.
| "The idea that marks are the end-all
| and incentive of scholastic endeavor, is
a hold-over from our inherited Puri
tanism, the assumption that will-power
can accomplish anything," the educa
> tion professor said. Pointing out that
jan "A"' implies righteousness and a
| "D" the opposite, he exclaimed, "Why
i not let the "C" student achieve his
I measure without stigmatizing him as
a failure? Really, the publication of
grades is rather unhandsome."
Condemns Grading of Nobility
Dr. Davidson believes' that students
| must often choose between finding per
' sonal values and getting grades. "If
\ personal growth is intangible, some
thing is vitally wrong in American edu
cation," he said.
Attempts to judge a student's
| achievement by ability to pass a test
j are highly condemned by the education
j professor. "The attempt to measure
j the value of liberal study is like trying
to qualify such intangible matters as

I the enjoyment of a sunset or the ap
preciation of music: Intrinsic values
each student may find for himself in
liberal study cannot be forced upon
him and the measuring of them is be
! yond the reach of committees." He sug
gests that some estimate of achieve
-1 ment might be determined by a first
hand acquaintance with the individual.
Courses Should Be Limited
"Liberal education concerns appreci
ation of the body of culture and it
1 must be enjoyed in order to be liberal.
Significant material must be first-hand,
i emotional, esthetic, and intellectual.
; Yet the place of whole-hearted absorp
! tion of th£ very substance of the arts
i and sciences is being replaced by dull
! memorizing."
Courses are too inclusive today, Dr.
Davidson believes. "They should be
i limited to one phase of the many topics
now discussed by a professor in a con
j ventional length course."
In the future the college must adapt
! itself more closely to personal needs
of students, he thinks. That limited
funds and the large number of college
students make a personal contact be
tween professor and student impos
[ sible is appalling to Dr. Davidson.

j Publishing student grade averages in
i the "Bawlout" or elsewhere is con
demned by P. E. Davidson, associate
! professor of education, who believes
! that students are unwholesomely grade
[ conscious.
| "The idea that marks are the end-all
| and incentive of scholastic endeavor, is
a hold-over from our inherited Puri
tanism, the assumption that will-power
can accomplish anything," the educa
> tion professor said. Pointing out that
jan "A"' implies righteousness and a
| "D" the opposite, he exclaimed, "Why
i not let the "C" student achieve his
I measure without stigmatizing him as
a failure? Really, the publication of
grades is rather unhandsome."
Condemns Grading of Nobility
Dr. Davidson believes' that students
| must often choose between finding per
' sonal values and getting grades. "If
\ personal growth is intangible, some
thing is vitally wrong in American edu
cation," he said.
Attempts to judge a student's
| achievement by ability to pass a test
j are highly condemned by the education
j professor. "The attempt to measure
j the value of liberal study is like trying
to qualify such intangible matters as

I the enjoyment of a sunset or the ap
preciation of music: Intrinsic values
each student may find for himself in
liberal study cannot be forced upon
