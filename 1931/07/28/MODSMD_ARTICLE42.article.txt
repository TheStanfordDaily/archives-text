# RADIO EXPERIMENT CONTROLS MANEUVERS OF FAST DESTROYER
## Crewless Craft Automatically Calls Distress When Guide Fails 
### 
"The recent much-heralded naval
accomplishment of controlling a crew
less destroyer, the U.S.S. Stoddert, in
i its maneuvers by means of radio ro
bots, is more of a publicity stunt than
one of actual new inventions," says
F. E. Terman, associate professor of
electrical engineering.
Naval and other investigators have
been working to develop radio control
of mechanical devices for more than
ten years. In 1922 the navy shelled and
sank the radio-controlled U.S.S. Iowa.
However, the difference between the
Iowa and the Stoddert is that of speed.
The lowa could only make eight knots,
and the Stoddert twenty-six. Accord
ing to navy reports this experiment
i with the use of radio to control high
speed vessels of great maneuverability
was successful.
During the maneuvers the Stoddert
made a 180-degree turn while traveling
at top speed. This was the first time
this has ever been done. The Stoddert
also made its own way out of Pyramid
Cove, San Clemente Island, eighty
miles northeast of San Diego, guided
only by radio from the control ship.
Once out of the cove the acceleration
! of the Stoddert was increased by de
grees to her top speed. She blew her
i whistle and blinked her great search
light at radio commands.
En route back to San Clemente Island
something snapped in the radio equip
ment aboard the Stoddert. She came
to a stop automatically, turned off her
steam, and whistled lustily for help.
The tests had been completed, so her
' crew returned and within forty min
utes she was under way.
The Stoddert is a 195-foot vessel of
1500 tons which recently was ordered
decommissioned. She was equipped
with radio controls, iron helmets were
placed over her funnels and hatches,
and experiments begun with the idea
of making her a target for realistic sea
battles.
