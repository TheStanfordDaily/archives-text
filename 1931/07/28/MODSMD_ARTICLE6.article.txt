# O'Neill's Play Set For Presentation Friday Night
## Shows Sharp Contrast In Characters And Scenes 
### 
j Sharp contrasts, not only in charac
ters but in the eight scenes of the play,
| are outstanding in "The Hairy Ape,"
by Eugene O'Neill, which will be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall Friday
' evening. From the firemen's forecastle
of an ocean liner, the scene shifts to a
section of the promenade deck. It is a
change from crowded space, with a
ceiling so low that man cannot stand
J upright, to a blue and white shining
' expanse of sea and sunlight, a change
i from the cramped and hot living quar-
J ters of stokers to the cool leisure of
| deck chairs.
From the sunshine of the deck
j the scene travels down to the
' stokehole, a place of furnaces and
boilers, dim light and coal dust. Scenc
j four is the only one which is a repeat,
| and it returns to the firemen's fore
, castle. A stylized suggestiton of Fifth
Avenue follows, bringing an atmos
j phere of cleanliness and sunshine again,
J with a hint of shops in the background,
! a token of modern civilization,
j A row of cells in the prison on
i Blackwell's Island is the scene of the
j next activity; a line of cells designed
to recede in the distance, using a false
i perspective to create the illusion. An
! I.W.W. local office near the waterfront
I shows in painted persepective the in
| terior of a front room on the ground
j floor. The eighth scene takes place in
' the monkey house at the zoo, and is
; btiilt on much the same plan as the
j cell block in the prison.
The scenes, which have been de
: signed by Frederick Stover, technical
! director, are all being played against
' a black cyclorama, and are shallow
j sets, built simply and for quick shifts.
; The painting of the sets is all done in
values of black to white, with touches
j of a cold steely blue to bring the sets
| out of monotony.
In the Felton Library is number 449
I of a special, limited and autographed
, edition of "The Hairy Ape," with ill us—
: trations by Alexander King. This edi
tion is published by Horace Liverighl.
Of the book O'Neill said that, had he
| himself been a great artist, he could
! not have produced a finer synchroniza
tion between the text and drawings.

j Sharp contrasts, not only in charac
ters but in the eight scenes of the play,
| are outstanding in "The Hairy Ape,"
by Eugene O'Neill, which will be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall Friday
' evening. From the firemen's forecastle
of an ocean liner, the scene shifts to a
section of the promenade deck. It is a
change from crowded space, with a
ceiling so low that man cannot stand
J upright, to a blue and white shining
' expanse of sea and sunlight, a change
i from the cramped and hot living quar-
J ters of stokers to the cool leisure of
| deck chairs.
