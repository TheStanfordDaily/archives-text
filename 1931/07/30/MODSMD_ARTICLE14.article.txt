## 
### 
"Business training is more and more
stressing the importance of giving per
sonal service,'" says J. Hugh Jackson,
professor of accounting and recently
appointed dean of the Graduate School
of Business.
Professor Jackson points out that
fifty years ago the great majority of
personal service was given by doctors,
lawyers, and ministers; but with the
last few years business men have been
coming to the front. Two very notable
examples are Owen D. Young and
Dwight W. Morrow.
This tendency toward service, ac
cording to Professor Jackson, may be
attributed to the work of the business
schools and to the service clubs. The
humanitarian aspect and the business
value of good will—both gained through
service—have been widely l'ecognized.
That the registration in the future in
collegiate business schools will increase
is the opinion of Professor Jackson. He
is also hopeful that in the future a
larger percentage of students will train
themselves_to be real business adminis
trators rather than mere specialists.
