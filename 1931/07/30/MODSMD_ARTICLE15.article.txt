# MENAGERIE AT BETA HOUSE GETS SPECIAL CARE IN PECULIAR DIET
## 
### 
When the menagerie roll is tailed
at meal times in the Beta house, a
i week-old nanny-goat, a parrot, two
I dogs, and an alley cat answer.
Josephine, the goat infant, must be
fed by hand from a bottle, and her
appetite makes it necessary to add two
j quarts to the daily milk order. As for
I Soab, the parrot, no hand but his rnas-
I ter's may feed him. He is herbivorous
to the extent of refusing steaks, and
! demanding morning-glory seeds as a
steady diet. Educated in a Persian
' monastery before his purchase by Jim
i mie Hirsch and Norman MacLeod,
keeper of the zoo, Soab declines to
1 learn English, and makes remarks in-
I telligible to none, except, perhaps, his

doting and jealously proud possessors.
Pal, an airedale, who is a tradition
and a near-institution on the campus,
has a German police companion, Sonny,
to assist in the maintenance of canine
dignity in the midst of such undigni
fied company.
Cleo, the black and white cat, is alone
In her feline glory, for where there
I were two cats, but one remains. Cleo's
| fellow-cat was "taken for a ride" on
j Tuesday evening.
Though Soab's wants are especially
cared for by his master, it has become
| the duty of two freshmen living at the
I Beta house for the summer to feed the
I dogs and the cat their rations ,and to
j warm Josephine's milk bottle.
