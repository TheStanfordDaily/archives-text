# The 						"Hairy Ape" Ready For Showing Tomorrow Night; Heiser Well Cast
## 
### 
DROMISING to he one of the most popular plays seen on the campus for some
time, Eugene O'Neill's drama, "The Ilairy Ape," will be given its final polish
ing tonight for its presentation to the public at 8:15 o'clock tomorrow night in
the Assembly Ilail. Peter Heiser has, in the character of "Yank," lord over the
brute-men in the stokehole, one of the most difficult roles written for a single
actor. He appears in all hut one of the eight scenes, and motivates the action in
each scene. Few plays are written so much for one character as is this play
of O'Neill's. Heiser's task is not lightened any by the fact that he is a compara
tive novice in the art of the drama, having appeared on the campus but once,
two years ago, as the tattoed man in the 1929 Junior Opera, "Moving On." I)i-

Erector is satisfied that Hei
! ser's inexperience does not threaten to
be a handicap.
"The Hairy Ape" is a glorious play of
atmosphere, and, contrary to the opin
ion often expressed, is not one of
O'Neill's raw and more obscene plays.
In it he has made use of his experience
at sea, as he has in "Anna Christie,"
so that he has been able to record
faithfully the seagoing characters and
the language of the forecastle and
stokehole. O'Neill has written an au
thentic, real play, and one which is
best interpreted in an expressionistic
manner, as io being done in this pro
duction.
Titanic Drama Expresses Futility
A titanic drama of brute man in
modern civilization, "The Hairy Ape"
is the expression of the man who
doesn't belong, of a product of civiliza
tion which is at the same time not a
product, but a mistake, something left
out of consideration in the order of
things.
Carl Cartwright, as Paddy, senti
mental and lovable old Irishman, has
his first iole on the Stanford stage.
Herbert Jones, who plays Long, the
socialistic clement in the stokehole, has
been seen on the local stage in several
roles, including the production of
"Broadway" last summer, in which
Catherine Crary, who plays Mildred
Douglas, also took part. Dorothea John
son, who will play the role of the aunt
of the millionaire's daughter, is an ex
perienced actress.
Many Incidental Roles in I'lyy
There "are a great many other and
more incidental roles in the play, none
of which can be neglected, and all of
which are essential to the success of
the show. Co-operation and tho crea
tion and maintenance of , atmosphere
will insure the success or the failure
of a production which is composed of
as many scenes and depends on the
work of .as many people as does the
play tomorrow night.
The sets, designed by Frederick
Stover, and executed by the classes in
Theatre Workshop and Stage Design,
are expressionistic, without any at
tempt at true realism. Exotic and cx
citing contrasts appear in the scenes,
one being dark, and the next being
light and almost gay, boldly rhythmical
and symbolical, and purely artificial.
To create atmosphere and effect might
be said to be the end of the scene
designing and building.
