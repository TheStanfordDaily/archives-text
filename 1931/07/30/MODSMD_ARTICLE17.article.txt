# F. E. HILL, EDITOR AND POET, TO SPEAK IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
What a poet is going to do in the
face of a modern life—a life diffeient
from that of poets of heretofore, and
supposedly antagonistic to the writing
of poetry—is the theme of the lecture
to be given this afternoon by Frank
Ernest Hill. The lecture, entitled "The
Poet Faces the Machine Age," will be
given in the Little Theatre at 4:15
o'clock.
Hill graduated from Stanford in 1911, j
and went to Columbia to work foi his
doctor's degree. The war interrupted his I
work, and with his dissertation still to j
write, he joined the aviation corps. He ,
was stationed in a training camp in (
Texas, and the Armistice was signed
before his division was sent overseas.
Aided by his knowledge of avialion,
Hill became the advertising manager
of the Curtis Company following the j
war. His air experience also gave him j
the distinction of writing the only
poetry about flying that has been wi it
ten by an aviator. In his published j
volume of poetry, "Stone Dust," he j
has written a sonnet sequence on filing
He soon deserted the advertising field j
and went inio journalism. He was
recognized a* one of the best of edi
torial writers on the New Yurk Giobe '
and the New York Sun. A few years i
ago he was given a position on the edi
torial staff of the Longman Green Pub
lishing Company in New York City. As
long as it existed, he was one ol the \
editors of a poetry magazine called !
"The Measure."

Mrs. Frances Theresa Russell, asso
ciate professor of English at Stanford,
whose student Hill was as an undcr
] graduate, said that Hill had a poetic
i inclination when a student, and v talent
for writing spontaneous verse. Because
1 of experience and success as a poet of
the modern age, Hill will be particu
larly able to explain the position of a
poet today, in this supposedly unpoetic
age. ♦ »
