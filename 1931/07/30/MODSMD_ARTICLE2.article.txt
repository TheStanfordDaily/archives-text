# SAVE WATER, PREVENT SHORTAGE, IS APPEAL
## 
### 
"Campus residents must not forget
for even a day to do everything in
their power to conserve water. The
co-operation of everyone is needed to
prevent a more serious shortage before
Ihe next rain sason," warns Alfred L.
Trowbridge, assistant comptroller.
Statistics are being compiled on die
effect of the movement to curtail use
of water; these will be made known
soon, it was learned at the comptrol
ler's office.
Trowbridge expects that the use of
water during this week will be great
inasmuch as several of the leased farms
on University land will require irriga
tion.
