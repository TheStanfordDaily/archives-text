Ha! Ila! At lasl wo have something to sit back and laugh at.
The worm has turned and the college professor is now on the
"spot" that the college student has occupied for so many years.
In'an editorial Tuesday evening, the Palo Alio Times be
moans the lack of close acquaintance between students and
instructors at the present time.
"Undoubtedly lack of close acquaintance of instructor and
student is a deplorable handicap," says the Times. "Undoubtedly
too immense college population is a barrier to that ideal rela
tionship. Hut a still more unsurmountable barrier is the attitude
of many of the faculty members of the colleges. It is an indis
putable fact that many faculty members are content to pursue
their work without the anonyanee of close student contacts,"
Dr. Clarence Cook Little, former president of the University
of Michigan, really turns the heat on, and in an article in yes
terday's San Francisco Chronicle said, "Some of the most dis
tinguished loaling in America is done on the college faculties."
Dr. Cook proposes a live-year term for teachers and college
presidents instead of tenure? "during good behavior"—a sort of
cold shower every live years to wake up the professors.
The most sporting thing for the colleges to do would be to
declare a moratorium on examinations and thus led the students
sleep along with the professors.
