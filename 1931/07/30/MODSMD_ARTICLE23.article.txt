# TERM PAPERS
## 
### 
From, now until the end of the quarter is the "in season"
period for term papers. The production curve will rise sharply
until the last day of the quarter. Students in whose minds the
assignment has existed as a sinister Nemesis, will shake oil' the
boding evil and flee to the library there to realize their good
resolutions in pages of notes.
Perhaps they will lake notes and from those notes organize
a paper that will show evidences of original thinking. Perhaps
they will lift whole pages out of certain source materials and
with a lew transitional sentences here .and there hand it in,
hoping that the professor will not remember that the style and
presentation is suspiciously like that in such and such a book ii?
his bibligoraphy.
It's the old familiar racket. And the old bromide is still good:
"you will get as much out of (his course as you put in it." Few
professors are omniscient enough to prevent the determined
cribber from cribbing. Probably most of them do not greatly
care whether the student does an original bit of work or whether
he merely makes a transcript of someone else's work. Anyone
who makes the struggle to get into Stanford, who pays the
hundred ant! some dollars, and then insists on just "getting by"
â€”well ,nothing much can be done for him.
