# THE
						NEW FATALISM
## 
### 
A student in a certain class the other day in the course of a
discussion brought up the point that modern educational
methods are tending to create a fatalistic even defeatist attitude
in the minds of students. Explaining further, he said that the
prevalence of mental testing with the consequent grouping into
sections of dull, average, and bright influenced the attitude of
adolescents, especially in regard to their ability to realize their
ambitions.
The question is worth considering.
Back in the simple days when there was no thought of ques
tioning the heartening old maxim that every boy in this fair
land might become President, no youngster ever imagined that
his inherent ability might be limited. He believed, rather, that
provided he worked hard enough he could accomplish anything.
When he had reached maturity or old age without accomplish
ing all those far-flung ambitions, he could be comforted and
maintain his self-respect by saying to himself that had he only
worked hard enough lie would have made good.
The youth of today is likely to be more cynical. By the time
he reaches the university he probably has heard from a good
man sources that everyone is not born equal to everybody else.
He probably has had some experience with intelligence testing
and knows something of its alleged signilieance.
If it should happen that he has been given such a test, and
his score indicated that he was dull or average and if through
some unfortunate slip-up he learned of that score, he will either
become fatalistic or he will use lll;it knowledge to excuse his
own shortcomings. He may never learn of his position on the
"curve" and still imagine that his ability is below what it
really is.
• Theoretically it may be comforting for an individual to know
that his achievements in life need not be at the same level as
others about him and llnil success for him is merely living up
to his limited ability as indicated by his I.Q. The chances are
that such knowledge is unfortunate.
