GIRL HABIT—At the Varsity Theatre.
Charlie Ruggles, as the casual flirt
who keeps handkerchiefs, safety pms,
and silk stockings on hand for ihe re
lief of young ladies, holds together a
moving picture which is otherwise
pretty well hashed.
The plot revolves about Charlie's
habit of "Nibbling" and his • fiancee's
refusal to marry him while he is still
found in compromising situations. He
is mixed up with a gangster who wants
to marry the fiancee, and a series of
ridiculous situations fills up the few
thousand feet of film which eventually
end with the usual happy conclusion.
If one likes Ruggles (and the best peo
ple have been known to smile at him)
"Girl Habit" is fairly good.

***THE VINEGAR TREE—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.

Assemble a foolish, frivolous wife;
her aging, grouchy husband; her ro
mantic sweetheart of twenty-five years
ago; a pretty daughter of twenty, who
feels bitter because she is a virgin; the
daughter's college lover whose aim is
"worldliness" and whose ideal is
"sophistication"; and a charming but
cynical adventuress in a beautiful
country home, and the setting is ar
ranged.
To these characters assign lines that
border occasionally on wickedness but
which are kept from slipping too far
by the happy-go-lucky tone in general
and a barrel of laughs in particular.
With the inimitable Billie Burke as the
silly wife, Laura Merrick, and we have
this very funny, fast-moving produc
tion. The plot pursues a zig-zag course,
taking new and unexpected turns at
every other line. Setting, lighting, and
costuming £.re excellent.
