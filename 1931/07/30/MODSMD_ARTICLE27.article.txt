# APPROPRIATE $2,500 FOR BEAUTIFYING OF NEW HOSPITAL SITE
## 
### 
Use of $2500 for the purpose of im
proving the new Palo Alto Hospital
grounds has been authorized by the
city council. The sum represents Ihe
unappropriated balance of the existing
hospital fund.
The most important work to be done,
according to L. H. Anderson, deputy
city engineer, will be the laying of
water mains, installation of a sprinkler
system, lawn and shrub planting, and
the improvement of parking areas.
It was stated that a private donation
of approximately the same amount is
expected to be made next month to
supplement the $2500 taken from the
hospital fund.
The transfer was suggested by Ihe
city engineer who presented the plan
to the council with the recommenda
tion of the municipal committee on
ways and means.
