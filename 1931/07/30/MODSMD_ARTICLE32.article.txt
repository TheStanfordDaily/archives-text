# VALUE OF WILBUR'S WORK EMPHASIZED BY NORTHCUTT ELY
## Child Welfare Project Is Most Progressive Movement Of Government 
### 
"People at Stanford will realize in
future years that any one of the pro
jects successfully undertaken by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of Stan
ford on leave and Secretary of the De
partment of the Interior, may be mat
ters of great pride to the University."
This was predicted by Northcutt Ely,
executive secretary to Dr. Wilbur and
member of the Class of 1924, in an in
terview yesterday. Ely is visiting on
the campus and will remain here until
August 3.
"Taken all together; in the field of
Indian affairs, the rounding out of the
National Park Service, the reorganiza
tion on a research basis in the Office
of Education, the lopping off of the
Pension Bureau, the new program of
scientific investigation for the Geologi
cal Survey, the building of Hoover
Dam, the mapping out of a new public
land policy, and the White House Con
ference, mean the most concerted for
ward surge that any Secretary of the
Interior has ever brought to that de
partment," declared Ely.
"In regard to the oil industry," con
tinued the secretary, "the federal gov
ernment has had a hand in many im
portant developments during the past
year. The sore spots of the industry
lie in Oklahoma where the governor is
attempting to shut down production
until a right price is available, and in
the eastern fields of Texas where a
great number of small operators are
producing at low costs. As a result, a
special session of the Texas legislature
was called in order to work out some
plan for stiffened control. In California
the oil industry is cleaning up its own
house."
It was pointed out by Ely that there
is a growing appreciation of Secretary
Wilbur's leadership in the oil industry
which started two years ago when he
asked for state co-operation.
"In addition to his regular duties,"
concluded Ely, "Dr. Wilbur has acted
as head of the White House Conference
on child health and child protection,
which is the most important single step
that the federal government has ever
taken in regard to children. As a re
sult of the conference, foundations for
a continuing program under Dr. Wil
bur have been made, and his plans
aim to reduce infant mortality, im
prove educational and vocational op
portunities, and lengthen the educa
tional span of the average child."

"People at Stanford will realize in
future years that any one of the pro
jects successfully undertaken by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of Stan
ford on leave and Secretary of the De
partment of the Interior, may be mat
ters of great pride to the University."
This was predicted by Northcutt Ely,
executive secretary to Dr. Wilbur and
member of the Class of 1924, in an in
terview yesterday. Ely is visiting on
the campus and will remain here until
August 3.
"Taken all together; in the field of
Indian affairs, the rounding out of the
National Park Service, the reorganiza
tion on a research basis in the Office
of Education, the lopping off of the
Pension Bureau, the new program of
scientific investigation for the Geologi
cal Survey, the building of Hoover
Dam, the mapping out of a new public
land policy, and the White House Con
ference, mean the most concerted for
ward surge that any Secretary of the
Interior has ever brought to that de
partment," declared Ely.
"In regard to the oil industry," con
tinued the secretary, "the federal gov
ernment has had a hand in many im
portant developments during the past
year. The sore spots of the industry
lie in Oklahoma where the governor is
attempting to shut down production
until a right price is available, and in
the eastern fields of Texas where a
great number of small operators are
producing at low costs. As a result, a
special session of the Texas legislature
was called in order to work out some
plan for stiffened control. In California
the oil industry is cleaning up its own
house."
It was pointed out by Ely that there
is a growing appreciation of Secretary
Wilbur's leadership in the oil industry
which started two years ago when he
asked for state co-operation.
"In addition to his regular duties,"
concluded Ely, "Dr. Wilbur has acted
as head of the White House Conference
on child health and child protection,
which is the most important single step
that the federal government has ever
taken in regard to children. As a re
sult of the conference, foundations for
a continuing program under Dr. Wil
bur have been made, and his plans
aim to reduce infant mortality, im
prove educational and vocational op
portunities, and lengthen the educa
tional span of the average child."
