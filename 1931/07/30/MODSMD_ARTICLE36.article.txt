# BOYS AT THE OLD GRIND Port Lights in Telescopes! ROUGE USED FOR POLISH
## 
### 
Days of grinding glass with iine
emery, and then polishing of the same
glass with rouge, is the program of the
summer vacation of the two boys who
are at present engaged in building
telescopes in the basement of the
psysies department.
The two youths are Tom Newell, 13,
and Lawson Richtmyer, 14. The former
is a Palo Altan, and the latter is the
son of Professor F. K. Richtmyer, who
is an acting professor from Cornell
University in New York. They are
being instructed by Professor P. A.
Ross and Burton Stuart, both of whom
have built telescopes.
The finished telescopes will be of
the reflecting type, with eight and a
half inch lenses, and will be about six
feet in length. The lenses are being
ground, witn emery, from port lights
intended for i ship, and are one inch
thick. The emery which they have
bought for grinding is of varying
grades, the finest, which is used last,
being so fine that it takes one hour to
settle when it is suspended in water.
After the lenses have been ground,
they will be polished with rouge—an
extremely brilliant and liquid polishing
medium, chemically related to its cos
metic cousin.
'"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,"
might be the chant of Lawson Richt
myer and Tom Newell at present, since
their work is being hindered by the
discovery of little bubbles in the glass,
making it necessary to grind for a few
more days before the polishing.can be
started.
