# SEVERAL NEW SPECIES OF PHILIPPINE SHELLS IN GEOLOGY MUSEUM
## 
### 
Six new species of Philippine shells
are being described and named for pub
lication by Mrs. Ida S. Oldroyd, curator
of the geological museum. She has boon
working on the Philippine collection of
land and .sea shells since last year when
it was secured by the University fiom
Mrs. S. L. Burkholder, daughter of Mrs.
S. L. Mitchel, who spent more than
thirty years collecting them. From 200
to 300 shells still remain to be classified.
According to Mrs. Oldroyd quantities
of land shells, many of which have
never been discovered before and most
of which were found on the one island
of Balabac, have added greatly to the
Stanford collections.
There are many interesting peculiari
ties about shells. For instance in the
Philippine collectiton there is a small
shell that belongs to the genus Teredo.
It is a' ship-worm but in this case it
was found buried in a pandana nut that
grows on the islands. Another interest
ing point concerns a shell belonging to
the Neritina genus. The shelly have
small cases on the outer surface. Each
of these egg-cases, as they are called,
contains tiny, microscopic shell cxea
tures that have been hatched.
Aside from the Philippine collection
there are many other shells of all
shapes, sizes, and colors in the collec
tion. Two oysters shells in particular
are of interest in that, opened, each
reveals a pearl, perfectly formed, about
one-fourth of an inch in diameter.
