# BYZANTINE'DRUNKARD RULER' DISCUSSED BY PROFESSOR GREGOIRE
## Reign of Michael the Third Saw Christianization of Bulgarians 
### 
"Michael the Drunkard," whose reign
was one of the most brilliant in Byzan
! tine history in spite of his habitual
drunken condition and the hatred which
I lu- incurred, was discussed yesterday
afternoon by Professor Henri Greguire.
1 Professor Greigoire, who presented this
j lecture in French as one of his series
on Byzantine culture and civilization,
told of the reign of Michael 111 and its
connection with the Macedonian dy
nasty which followed Michael's death.
Speaking of the accomplishments of
Michael, who was the ruler of Byzan
tium from 840 to 8t57 A.D., the lecturer
stated that "Michael, to be sure, was
not only a drunkard. His reign was one
of the most brilliant of Byzantium. It is
surprising to find how many problems
were settled, how many questions
solved, how many enemies repelled,
hew many decisive diplomatic actions
I taken, how many great generals, states
men, and churchmen were active in
the short space of time of those Tew
years."
Bulgarian King Christened
Under Michael the Arabs were crusli
ingly beaten in BG3, for the first time
in many years. As a consequence of
'that battle, the Bulgarians surrendered
i themselves, fearing an attack on the
j whole Byzantine army. This triumph
j over the Bulgarians was, Professor
| Gregoire said, one of the greatest suc
j cesses of Byzantine politics. The Bui
j garians accepted, along with the By
-1 zantine supremacy, Byzantine Chris
i tianity. The Bulgarian king was chris
tened and became Boris Michael, the
J first Christian king of the Bulgarians.
Basil I, the founder of the Mace
i donian dynasty, killed Michael 111 in
867 and became ruler. The Macedonian
j dynasty lasted from that date until the
; middle of the eleventh century.
Michael Founder of Dynasty-
Historians and chroniclers have
| charged Michael with every sort of
I crime, but, Professor Gregoire stated,
i the despised ruler could be credited
i with the very foundation of the Mace
j donian dynasty, since it was probable
; that Michael was the real father of the
! future emperor, Leo VI, the official
| sen and successor of Basil. "So there
lis strong probability in favor of the
I tragic hypothesis that the Macedonian
dynasty, whose members so hated the
memory of Michael the Drunkard, were
of the line of that ruler," concluded
Professor Gregoire.
