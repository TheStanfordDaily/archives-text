# W.F.E.A. CONFERENCE IN HONOLULU NEXT YEAR IS BOOSTED
## Federation of Education Associations Meets In July 
### 
"Delightful climate, beautiful sccn
try, wonderful hospitality"â€”terms of
this characters are used to describe the
setting of the 1932 regional conference
of the World Federation of Education
Associations to be held in Hawaii next
summer.
Claiming a summer climate as nearly
pcrfect as one can find outside of
Chamber of Commerce literature, or
the Stanford campus, the World Feder
ation Committee of the Hawaiian Edu
cation Association is endeavoring to
lure many delegates to the island
shores.
According to the committee, Hono
lulu offers an ideal situation for the
W.F.E.A. convention. It is geographi
cally near the center of the Pacific
basin, with adequate steamship service
from all countries; it has available to
the visitor almost every conceivable
form of recreation, including swimming,
golf, tennis, hiking, and boating. For
those who wish to study, the University
of Hawaii summer courses will place
special emphasis on Polynesian culture
and Pacific international relations.
The Hawaiian Islands, as the "cross
roads of the Pacific," present a unique
world situation, and offer an excellent
example for the investigator to examine
the results of universal public educa
tion as practiced on an admixture of
all the elements which constitute the
peoples surrounding the Pacific.
