# TEXAS' ELEVEN-YEAR PUBLIC SCHOOL PLAN INADEQUATE â€“ CLUBB

That the seven-year grammar, four
year high-school curriculum of Texas
does not adequately prepare students
for college work, is the opinion of Mer
rill Dare Clubb, visiting professor of
English, from Texas Christian Univer
sity. Clubb declares that such under
graduates are too young to assimilate
instruction of college grade, and that
the adoption of the twelve-year pre
paratory system used by other states
would tend to remedy this situation.
"Texas is no longer a frontier, as so
many believe, but is as modern as the
best of them," said Clubb. "Politics
enters into the school world to a great
extent at present, but most'of the
troubles are in the nature of growing
pains. Much of the money which for
merly went to the University of Texas
at Austin is now diverted to the Texas
Agricultural and Mechanical College
for vocational work."
It is Clubb's opinion that the Junior
College movement is making headway
in Texas about as it is in California.
"There, as here, the movement is
viewed with suspicion by higher state
institutions," he said.
