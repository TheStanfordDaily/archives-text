# "CASEY" KAZANJIAN TRICKED IN MAT BOUT LOST TO DR. SARPOLIS
## 
### 
By his subtle impersonation of the
referee, Dr. Carl Sarpolis defeated
' Casey Kazanjian, former Stanford
athlete, in their wrestling bout at
Dreamland Auditorium Tuesday night.
Casey was working hard on his op
ponent's ankle with a toe-hold that
Sarpolis apparently could not break.
The Doctor reached around and tapped
Casey's back whereupon the ex-Stan
ford man, believing it to be the re
feree's signal that he had won the fall,
released his hold, jumped up, and
strolled toward his corner. Instantly
Sarpolis leaped on Casey with a flying
body scissors that gave him the final
fall.
Sarpolis won the first fall with the
seme flying scissors but was forced to
forfeit the second when he could not
break Kazanjian's mean toe-hoold.
