# BIRD LIFE THRIVES ON CAMPUS PRESERVE; SWALLOWS AND QUAIL RAISE LARGE FAMILIES
## 
### 
Not the least interesting sight for
visitors to Stanford is the bird life.
The quail and the swallows which are
protected from molestation on the cam
pus add a charm to a place already
beautiful.
The quail are the California variety,
which is found from southwestern
Oregon to Lower California. But most
of these birds make their home be
tween Oregon and Monterey county in
California. They aie found in large
numbers on almost any part of the
campus; from (hi Memorial Church to
the highway, and from Roble to Toyon.
These quail nest upon the ground,
laying from ten to fifteen eggs. The
young hatch in May. If surprised tiiey
will lie perfectly quiet, or else will
scurry under a large leaf, as brown as
themselves.
California quail are scarcely distin
guishable from Valley quail, and the
two will sometimes raise a hybrid fam
ily. Both are much smaller than the
Mountain quail, which lives at the 4000-
foot level.
The swallows are found under tne
eaves of the Engineering and Psycho
logy buildings, where they live in their
mud nests. Twice during the summer
they hatch from three to six eggs. Win-

J tertime finds them in Chile, Brazil,
| Argentina, or southern Mexico. At the
j earliest sign of spring the swallows
; return to raise their young and begin
j the process all over again. The San
j Francisco Bay region is a favorite haunt
j of swallows in California, as are also
| Merced and Tulare counties, where
! they inhabit the frameworks of old
bridges.
Besides cats, there is one other ser
pent in this bird paradise. The Cali
fornia bluejav, Swarth's California Jay,
to be exact, shares this campus sanctu
j ary with quail and swallow. He is not
j particular about his diet, and will as
; soon cat the young of his neighbois as
j the choicest grub. For this reason the
, jay is considered a pest. Campers know
j him for a thieving noisebox.
| When the jay builds his nest he
i makes sure that it is well secluded,
I and while the young are being raised
Ihe is very quiet, as if harboring a
; guilty conscience. Hot weather does not
| agree with him, and a dry season will
; almost completely silence his raucous
j screech. But the jay has a saving grace
1 —he is very handsome in a blue and
j white suit—and some members of the
1 clan disport a topknot.
