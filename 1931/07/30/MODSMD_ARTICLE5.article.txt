# Ideas of Bakunin Forerunner of Communism
## Bakunin Opposed Central Authority in State 
### 
"The chief idea of Bakunin, Russia's
apostle of anarchism, was revolt against
any dictatorship. He believed that man
has only two important faculties: the
power to think, and the power to re
volt!" Thus declared Professor George
Vernadsky of Yale University, lectur
ing in the Little Theatre Tuesday eve
ning.
"Bakunin was a tall giant of a man,
with the disheveled head of a lion and
piercing green eyes. He was a powerful
orator and writer, his 'Confessions to
Nicholas ll' constituting a most brilliant
piece of political and historical litera
ture on all the revolutionary move
ments of his time.
Influence Felt by Lenin
"Although Bakunin's followers were
to be found outside his own country,
his influence is seen in the Soviet idea
of Communism formulated by Lenin in
his struggle against Russian parlia
mentary methods of government. How
ever, Lenin is credited with the state
ment, 'I would have found him a valu
able ally on the first day of a revolu
tion, but I would have shot him on the
second day.'"
Vernadsky pointed out that the chief
difference between Lenin the Com
munist and Marx the Socialist on ihe
one hand, and Bakunin the Anarchist
on the other was that the former de
manded a centralization of authority in
the state—while the latter militantly
opposed any form of centralized con
trol.
"Bakunin's revolutionary tendencies
appeared early in his life. As a boy he
was a very quarrelsome child at home,
and was eventually forced to leave iiis
family because of his continual med
dling and disagreements.
Had Revolutionary Philosophy
"In his youth," declared Vernadsky,
"Bakunin wa& influenced in his politi
cal philosophy by Hegel's conviction
that 'what :s actual is rational,' but in
lifter years lost all semblance of con
servatism in reversing this statement
to assert that whatever is rational is
actual. With this belief he justified his
attack upon the existing state.
"To Voltaire's epigram, 'If there wore
no God we would have to create one,'
he replied, 'If there were a God we
would have to abolish Him!' Perhaps
because of his revolutionary philosophy
he found many women crazy about
him, although he met their attentions
with utter indifference."
Bakunin was pictured as a meddle
some sort of person by Professor Ver
nodsky. "He was the kind of a man
who was always trying to find out and
explain why you sneezed this time, in
stead of coughing " And because
his militant opposition to any form of
restraint resulted in his income being
very limited and uncertain, he con
tinually borrowed from his friends.
Sometimes he paid them back, more
often not; but he often divided his last
few dollars with the needy.
Five Acts Portray Career
Five acts would roughly depict the
career of Bakunin in the opinion of
Vernadsky: 1. His early Hegelian philo
sophy which was conservative; 2.
Growth of his revolutionary sympathies
and participation in many European
revolutionary movements outside his
own country; 3. Period of imprison
ment by Czar Nicholas 11, during which
time he wrote many accounts of his
activities and theories; 4. His participa
tion in the First International after his
escape to Western Europe by way of

San Francisco, a period in which he
quarreled with Marx over question of
state authority; and 5. Death from heart
disease, without friends or money, in
1876.
Vernadsky described the boyhood
home of Bakunin, whose parents were

well-to-do, which he had visited as the
guest of Hi kunin's nephew.
In summarizing Bakunin, Vernadsky
said, "He was a militant atheist, a mili
tant anarchist, and an ardent supporter
of the peasant-worker class against th<
liberal bourgeois."

"Bakunin's revolutionary tendencies
appeared early in his life. As a boy he
was a very quarrelsome child at home,
and was eventually forced to leave iiis
family because of his continual med
dling and disagreements.
Had Revolutionary Philosophy
"In his youth," declared Vernadsky,
"Bakunin wa& influenced in his politi
cal philosophy by Hegel's conviction
that 'what :s actual is rational,' but in
lifter years lost all semblance of con
servatism in reversing this statement
to assert that whatever is rational is
actual. With this belief he justified his
attack upon the existing state.
"To Voltaire's epigram, 'If there wore
no God we would have to create one,'
he replied, 'If there were a God we
would have to abolish Him!' Perhaps
because of his revolutionary philosophy
he found many women crazy about
him, although he met their attentions
with utter indifference."
Bakunin was pictured as a meddle
some sort of person by Professor Ver
nodsky. "He was the kind of a man
who was always trying to find out and
explain why you sneezed this time, in
stead of coughing " And because
his militant opposition to any form of
restraint resulted in his income being
very limited and uncertain, he con
tinually borrowed from his friends.
Sometimes he paid them back, more
often not; but he often divided his last
few dollars with the needy.
Five Acts Portray Career
Five acts would roughly depict the
career of Bakunin in the opinion of
Vernadsky: 1. His early Hegelian philo
sophy which was conservative; 2.
Growth of his revolutionary sympathies
and participation in many European
revolutionary movements outside his
own country; 3. Period of imprison
ment by Czar Nicholas 11, during which
time he wrote many accounts of his
activities and theories; 4. His participa
tion in the First International after his
escape to Western Europe by way of

San Francisco, a period in which he
quarreled with Marx over question of
state authority; and 5. Death from heart
disease, without friends or money, in
1876.
Vernadsky described the boyhood
home of Bakunin, whose parents were

well-to-do, which he had visited as the
guest of Hi kunin's nephew.
In summarizing Bakunin, Vernadsky
said, "He was a militant atheist, a mili
tant anarchist, and an ardent supporter
of the peasant-worker class against th<
liberal bourgeois."
"The chief idea of Bakunin, Russia's
apostle of anarchism, was revolt against
any dictatorship. He believed that man
has only two important faculties: the
power to think, and the power to re
volt!" Thus declared Professor George
Vernadsky of Yale University, lectur
ing in the Little Theatre Tuesday eve
ning.
"Bakunin was a tall giant of a man,
with the disheveled head of a lion and
piercing green eyes. He was a powerful
orator and writer, his 'Confessions to
Nicholas ll' constituting a most brilliant
piece of political and historical litera
ture on all the revolutionary move
ments of his time.
Influence Felt by Lenin
"Although Bakunin's followers were
to be found outside his own country,
his influence is seen in the Soviet idea
of Communism formulated by Lenin in
his struggle against Russian parlia
mentary methods of government. How
ever, Lenin is credited with the state
ment, 'I would have found him a valu
able ally on the first day of a revolu
tion, but I would have shot him on the
second day.'"
Vernadsky pointed out that the chief
difference between Lenin the Com
munist and Marx the Socialist on ihe
one hand, and Bakunin the Anarchist
on the other was that the former de
manded a centralization of authority in
the state—while the latter militantly
opposed any form of centralized con
trol.
