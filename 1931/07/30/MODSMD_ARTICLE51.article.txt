'The prosent economic crisis empha
sizes the fact that the United States
cannot afford to remain aloof from
European affairs," says Visiting Profes
sor David Harris, of the Stanford his
tory department. "This country's atti
tude toward the payment of war debts
has contributed to the world political
and economic uncertainty."
Professor Harris is well acquainted
with the conditions in Europe both
from observation and a knowledge
gained while attending universities in
Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. He believes
that America's policy of isolation v/ill
have to be abandoned. "Our foreign
interests must be protected and I do
not believe that can be done without
membership in the League. Possibly
the present serious situation could have
been averted if the United States today
possessed a more complete understand
ing of Europan affairs.
"I believe that Mr. Hoover's mora
torium will only make the payments
of Inter-Ailied debts and reparations a
more complex problem. The unsettled
conditions will continue until a d6finite
action, one way or the other, is taken.
"The har>py solution will come when
the debts are either cancelled or at
least lowered to a nominal sum. The
disarmament conference next year
should provide a solution of the debt
question; armaments are the real basis
for the present world economic and
political disorder."
