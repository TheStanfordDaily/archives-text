# EDUCATORS HEAR SHELDON'S TALK ON DAYS OF '96
## Tells Of Stanford's Part In California Education 
### 
Referring to himself as a "survivor
of the 'gay nineties,' " Henry D. Shel
don, Stanford '96, spoke to the Men's
; Education Luncheon Club yesterday,
! on the early days at the University and
I the part it played in influencing educa
tion in California. Dr. Sheldon is acting
professor of education and dean of the
School of Education at the University
of Oregon.
Before speaking particularly of Stan
ford's part in moulding the school sys
tem of California, Dr. Sheldon spent a
few minutes in telling of life at Stan
ford during his undergraduate days,
i "Emerson's dictum that 'an institution
is but the length and breadth of a great
I man' was never better exemplified than
in the Stanford of the '90's," he de
clared, in speaking of David Starr Jor
dan's influence. "He was loved and
respected by all the students. Everyone
i took his famous course in Evolution,
j which was one of the first orientation
I courses in the country."
Faculty Spoke at Graduation
Dr. Sheldon* explained that the
i graduation orations at that time were
given by members of the faculty, in
order of their appointment. As a con
! sequence, he continued, it was not un
j usual for such speakers to use for the
i occasion some scientific treatise they
had written. One of the professors he
mentioned px - esented a lengthy analysis
of Hamlet's Soliloquy, while another
! gave a learned dissertation on the
i "Passing of Plato."
"Following the graduation oration,"
i he continued, "Dr. Jordan would arise
and for fifteen or twenty minutes talk
to us straight from the shoulder. The
influence of those talks is well remem
bered by all who ever heard them."
Entrance Requirements Easy
He spoke of the liberal entrance re
quirements, saying that while perhaps
ithey should not be held up as an
example to follow now, they did meet
i the needs of those seeking to enroll
then. They enabled many men who had
| been out in the world and who had
learned that they needed more train
ing to become students. While the en
trance requirements were somewhat
lax, Dr. Sheldon explained that the fac
ulty kept the standards high, even
going so far as to boast, at one time,
that they had sent eight out of eleven
men on the football team home.
The particular influence Stanford had
on the development of education in
California, he pointed out, was brought
about through the many addresses and
conferences that Dr. Jordan and his
associate made throughout the state.
These talks aroused the people to a
realization of the need for better sec
ondary schools, and this pressure re
sulted in the University of California
establishing a department of education.
Tells of First Education Dean
Dr. Sheldon concluded by recalling
the work of the first dean of the School
of Education, Earl C. Barnes, who is
still alive. "He was a provocative lec
turer," he said, "and had the faculty
of making his students want to argue
with him. He was especially interested
in child psychology and social history.
And throughout the state he led school
men to realize that there was some
thing more to education than method
ology and school management."
K. W. Onthank, dean of personnel
administration at the University of
Oregon, acted as chairman of the meet
ing, which was in charge of the school
men from Oregon. A chorus composed
of Oregon men furnished the musical
entertainment.

of Hamlet's Soliloquy, while another

"Following the graduation oration,"
i he continued, "Dr. Jordan would arise
and for fifteen or twenty minutes talk
to us straight from the shoulder. The
influence of those talks is well remem
bered by all who ever heard them."

He spoke of the liberal entrance re
quirements, saying that while perhaps
ithey should not be held up as an
example to follow now, they did meet
i the needs of those seeking to enroll
then. They enabled many men who had
| been out in the world and who had
learned that they needed more train
ing to become students. While the en
trance requirements were somewhat
lax, Dr. Sheldon explained that the fac
ulty kept the standards high, even
going so far as to boast, at one time,
that they had sent eight out of eleven
men on the football team home.
The particular influence Stanford had
on the development of education in
California, he pointed out, was brought
about through the many addresses and
conferences that Dr. Jordan and his
associate made throughout the state.
These talks aroused the people to a
realization of the need for better sec
ondary schools, and this pressure re
sulted in the University of California
establishing a department of education.
Tells of First Education Dean
Dr. Sheldon concluded by recalling
the work of the first dean of the School
of Education, Earl C. Barnes, who is
still alive. "He was a provocative lec
turer," he said, "and had the faculty
of making his students want to argue
with him. He was especially interested
in child psychology and social history.
And throughout the state he led school
men to realize that there was some
thing more to education than method
ology and school management."

Before speaking particularly of Stan
ford's part in moulding the school sys
tem of California, Dr. Sheldon spent a
few minutes in telling of life at Stan
ford during his undergraduate days,
i "Emerson's dictum that 'an institution
is but the length and breadth of a great
I man' was never better exemplified than
in the Stanford of the '90's," he de
clared, in speaking of David Starr Jor
