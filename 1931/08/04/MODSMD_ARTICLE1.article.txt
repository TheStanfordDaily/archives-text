# SMALLERS' FIRST CONCERT SUNDAY PLEASES CROWD
## Last Guest Conductor Heard In Program of Varied Compositions Beethoven's Third Symphony, Strauss Tone Poem Are High Points 
### 
Alexander Smallens, fifth and final
conductor of this summer's symphony
concerts in the Woodland Theater at
Hillsborough, received the definite ap
proval of the audience Sunday. In a
program which ranged from Ihc archi
tectural beauty of a Beethoven sym
phony to the emotional intensity of a
Tone Poem by Richard Strauss, he
demonstrated his sound musical knowl
edge and feeling.
Smallens came here directly from
Philadelphia where he has been con
ducting that city's symphony orchestra
in a series of summer concerts. This
is his first appearance at Hillsborough.
Opening the concert Sunday was
Beethoven's Third" Symphony, the fa
mous "Eroica," for which Nnpoleon
Bonaparte was the inspiration. The mu
sic is dignified and grand, seldom ap
pealing to the emotions, but often to
the intellect. In the second movement,
the funeral march, the music is solemn
and even mournful, but it never
touches the stages of despondency or
despair. Probably the most pleasing
movement is the third, a Scherzo played
in allegro vivance. .
Beethoven's "Eroica" Played
The symphony consists of four move
ments: the first, allegro con brio in
E flat major; the second, a "maicia
funebre," an adagio; the third the
Scherzo already mentioned; and the
finale in "allegro molto."
Tschaikowsky's Overture - Fantasie
"Romeo and Juliet" opened the second
half of the program. Beginning with a
solemn theme that seems to symbolize
the "burden of fate," the overture un
folds the whole tragic drama it is taken
from. The enmity and hatred between
the Monatgue and Capulet families, the
love affair between the principal char
acters, the tragic chamber sceneâ€”#iil of
these phases are portrayed in the mu
sic. Such a story as this provided good
material for the great Russian, with
his inate sense of pathos and tragedy.
Strauss Waltz Is Heard
A delightful interlude was furnished
in "The Emperor Waltz" by Johann
Strauss. This well-known selection of
the "Waltz King" is typical of his best
Work, and presents to the audience a
composition of charm, finish, and irre
sistible melody.
Concluding the concert was a num
ber which furnished a decided contrast
to the intellectuality of the Beethoven
symphony. It was the Tone Poem,
"Don Juan" by Richard Strauss. This
composition, written when Strauss was
only 24 years old, graphically depicts
the life and exploits of the famous lit
erary character it is named after. The
story is of a young man of superb
health and vigor who sets out upon a
quest for the perfect example of wo
manhood. He flies from conquest to
conquest, always in pursuit of his ideal
and meeting always with disappoint
ment and disillusionment.
The orchestra interprets this emo
tional adventure in masterly sound pic
tures. The music increases in color
and intensity until, with a terrific
crash, the hero's death ends the story.
A few concluding bars tell of the calm
ness which comes after the exhaustion
of all desire.
The eighth and final concert of the
series will be conducted by Smallens
next Sunday.
