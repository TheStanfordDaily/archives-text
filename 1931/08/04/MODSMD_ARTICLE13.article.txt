# POET FRANK HILL DISCUSSES MACHINE-AGE EFFECTS ON MODERN THOUGHT AND WRITING
## 
### 
i The poet, in the face of the machine
| age, must put the machine in its place,
i and think of the age in terms of hu
man life instead of in terms of the
i machine itself. Thus would Frank Hill,
| poet and editor, solve the problem of
the poet who faces the machine age.
Hill, in his lecture in the Little Thea
' ter on Thursday afternoon, explained
I the machine age and the poetry which
|it has produced. The world today, he
pointed out, is a world entirely dif
ferent from that of Theocritus and his
shepherds, or that of Tennyson's "Lady
! of Shallott," or even the quiet farm
j life of Robert Frost. Everywhere there
I is speed, everywhere precision, power,
I and often noise. Some poets, like Wil
liam Morris, have fled the modern
world. Others, though they have not
followed his example, have been trou
bled with the problems of the modern
age and how to interpret it, which is
j the business, he said.
i "The world has changed," Hill de-
J clared, "and the machines and the sci
[ cnce back of them have been respon
! sible for the change." He recalled the
various changes effected by the ma
chine age, including: Advances in
clinical sciences, advances in the effi

ciency of the production of crops and
of useful articles, the ability to use
night as well as day, and also to extend
summer into the winter, giving man a
greater working power.
Tennyson and Kipling and Walt
Whitman found inspiration rather than
depression in the new age. Whitman
in particular, Hill said, had begun to
see the possibilities of its power and
vitality.
In 1895, the "machine age" as we
know it was very young, Hill explained,
and the poetry that was written was
that of men like Richard le Gallienne,
who wrote very proper and romantic
verse. In 1913, however, there was a
sudden outburst of interest on the part
of the poets. The Poetry Magazine was
founded. Walt Whitman, Carl Sand
burg, Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, and
H. D. were all stimulating influences
in the field of poetry. Vachel Lindsay,
Robert Frost, Edwin Arlington Robin
son, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Eli
nor Wylie were all good but not sen
sational poets. Since that time there
has been a great deal of poetry of vi
tality, and there has been a stimula
tion, and fervent activity, among poets,
Hill pointed out.

In 1895, the "machine age" as we
know it was very young, Hill explained,
and the poetry that was written was
that of men like Richard le Gallienne,
who wrote very proper and romantic
verse. In 1913, however, there was a
sudden outburst of interest on the part
of the poets. The Poetry Magazine was
founded. Walt Whitman, Carl Sand
burg, Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, and
H. D. were all stimulating influences
in the field of poetry. Vachel Lindsay,
Robert Frost, Edwin Arlington Robin
son, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Eli
nor Wylie were all good but not sen
sational poets. Since that time there
has been a great deal of poetry of vi
tality, and there has been a stimula
tion, and fervent activity, among poets,
Hill pointed out.
i The poet, in the face of the machine
| age, must put the machine in its place,
i and think of the age in terms of hu
man life instead of in terms of the
i machine itself. Thus would Frank Hill,
| poet and editor, solve the problem of
the poet who faces the machine age.
Hill, in his lecture in the Little Thea
' ter on Thursday afternoon, explained
I the machine age and the poetry which
|it has produced. The world today, he
pointed out, is a world entirely dif
ferent from that of Theocritus and his
shepherds, or that of Tennyson's "Lady
! of Shallott," or even the quiet farm
j life of Robert Frost. Everywhere there
I is speed, everywhere precision, power,
I and often noise. Some poets, like Wil
liam Morris, have fled the modern
world. Others, though they have not
followed his example, have been trou
bled with the problems of the modern
age and how to interpret it, which is
j the business, he said.
i "The world has changed," Hill de-
J clared, "and the machines and the sci
[ cnce back of them have been respon
! sible for the change." He recalled the
various changes effected by the ma
chine age, including: Advances in
clinical sciences, advances in the effi

ciency of the production of crops and
of useful articles, the ability to use
night as well as day, and also to extend
summer into the winter, giving man a
greater working power.
Tennyson and Kipling and Walt
Whitman found inspiration rather than
depression in the new age. Whitman
in particular, Hill said, had begun to
see the possibilities of its power and
vitality.
