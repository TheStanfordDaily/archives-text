# CATHCART ACCLAIMS WORK CONDUCTED BY WICKERSHAM BOARD
## 
### 
"In place of private opinions ex
; pressed by individuals, which arc ire-
I quently erroneous, we need a factual
i knowledge of the exact condition of
! our court system," Arthur M. Cath
i cart, professor of law, said yesterday
concerning the work being done by
the Wickersham Enforcement Commis
sion.
Professor Cathcart stated that ade
quate information is acquired only
through such an investigation as the
Commission is conducting, whereby the
true state of affairs can be known.
"It is impossible to say off-hand just
i what are the underlying causes for the
j present crime wave. In order to obtain
true facts about crime and law enforce
| ment the government must spend a
i large sum of money. Whether or not
! the Commission will be granted enough
money to complete its investigation re-
I mains to be seen. But the highly c >m
petent personnel of the Commission
should produce results worth their ex
! pense."
