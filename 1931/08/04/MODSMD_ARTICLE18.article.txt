# EDUCATORS TOLD DETRIMENTS OF ASSURED SALARY
## Wood and Cubberley Declare Teachers Unacquainted With Conditions Opportunity of Universities To Reach High Plane Is Stressed 
### 
School men, because of the relative
security of an assured salary, do not
realize the true economic condition that
[ exists at the present time. This was the
| warning made both by Dr. E. P. Cub
berley and Will C. Wood, vice-presi
i dent of the Bank of America, speaking
i to the 285 men and women who attend
! Ed the Education Banquet at the Union
! Thursday night.
Speaking on ihe topic, "Whither Are
We Bound?" Dr. Cubberley empha
| sized the fact that schools must pre
| pave to educate even more for leisure
| time activities. He pointed out that
! with the increase in unemployment,
j industry will have to use men on al
j ternate days for three or four hours,
| thus causing a tremendous increase in
| leisure.
Universities Have Opportunity
Dr. Cubberley believes that there is
j a tremendous opportunity for univorsi
! ties, such as Stanford, to step to a
higher plane by concentrating on giv
ing intensive training to fewer rnd
carefully selected students. He would
have the University limit itself, more
or less, for important positions, such as
: school administrators and counselors,
:in small experimental and research
i groups.
Will C. Wood, superintendent of pub
lic instruction in California before he
took his present position with the Bank
of America, spoke on the subject, "A
j Business Man Looks at Education." Ac
cording to Mr. Wood, the period of
inflation in education paralleled the
economic inflation and like every other
industry has been guilty of "overpro
j duction." The break came in 1929, re
j suiting in one of the worst periods of
I world-wide depression since the devel
i opment of credit in business.
Readjustment in Schools
Wood declared that every individual
j and institution in the world must have
i a part in the period of readjustment,
j "It will be a period of re-evaluation of
| parts of the economic structure," he
stated; "Education cannot go on with
out taking into consideration this de
flation.
"Education must be maintained un 7
| impaired as far as essentials are con
j cerned, but a strict evaluation must de-
I termine the essentials. Those things
that do not prove themselves must be
eliminated in the interests of economy."
Speaking of the objectives of educa
tion, Wood declared that business wants
| character and intelligence, plus a gen
i eral education more strongly than it
wants specialized training. He ex
plained that business, for example, is
changing too rapidly for anything but
a general training to be of much value.
Background Training Is Needed
"More people fail through lack of
general background," he continued,
"than from lack of technical training.
I Character determines ,very largely, the
kind of position a man obtains as well
as his standing in the community.
Greater attention must be paid to the
qualities and attitudes that go into the
make-up of character. Those school
I activities that promote this training are
| among the essential ones."
Dr. L. M. Tcrmpn, professor of psy
chology, was toastmastcr. Three bari -
| tone solos were sung by Claude Shull.
i The Phi Delta Kappa quartet, com-
I posed of Shull, G. T. Krous, Harold
Benjamin, and R. D. Case was heard in
a group of songs, in one of which they
accompanied Benjamin Culver, bari
j tone. Mrs. Eleanor Baker was the ac-
I companist.
