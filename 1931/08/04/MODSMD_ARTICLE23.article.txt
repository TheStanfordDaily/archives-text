# CHANCE FOR SOMEBODY TO BUILD AN ART SCHOOL
## 
### 
Stanford is hv no means a complete university. Having
schools of Jaw, medicine, engineering, preparing students lor
careers in many fields, it is lacking almost wholly in other di
rections. Especially is this true of the arts.
Music, architecture, and the fine arts receive little attention
at Stanford. In music we have only the training that Warren
Allen can give in connection with his work with the choir and
the choruses that he develops from time to time for special oc
casions. In architecture we have only the simple though excel
lent courses dealing primarily with domestic design ;rnd plan
ning which Professor Clark has offered.
There is hardly a beginning in these two, but in the tine arts,
despite the heavy restrictions which have surrounded the small
staff of the Division of (iraphic Art we do have a real founda
tion on which an art school might be reared. The division, part
of the School of Education and confining its work primarily to
efforts as a training school for future teachers, if given the
proper impetus could be the nucleus of a larger and much more
complete school of fine arts, which would not only turn out
teachers armed with the basic elements, but would add in num
bers to the few who now graduate from the division yearly in
tending to follow art.for its own sake.
Limitations on the financial capacity tit the I niversitv pre
vents its augmenting the graphic art division by expanding it
into a self-sufficient and complete department, developing stu
dents of art who would use their knowledge, not as a hobby or
a profession, but as an expression of feeling inspired by their
surroundings.
What an opportunity this would be for some philanthropic
person to immortalize his name by endowing at Stanford a
school of fine arts. ,
