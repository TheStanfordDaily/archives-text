# CRYING' NEED IS ALWAYS FACTS

Professor Cathcart of 1 lie Stanford Law School uttered no
new truth when he said that what we need in order to know
what we must do to deal effectively with the present "crime
wave" is facts. It is no new truth, but it is a truth, nevertheless.
Our greatest difficulty in handling situations that are ob
viously bad is our readiness to go ahead on guess-work and then
to expend a good share of our energy fighting about whose guess
is right and whose wrong.
Guesses are easy and cheap and useless; facts arc hard to
get and expensive to get. Professor Cathcart infers that the
Wickersham Commission has in its personnel the ability to get
facts but he is sensible enough to be at least doubtful whether
the commission will be granted enough money to do the needtul
thing that it is capable of doing.
And there is still a further dillicultv, which is that even it
these qualified investigators did uncover and present facts, in
stead of action based on those facts we would have the guessers
setting up their theories against the commission's tindings and
the merry war of words going full till just as if the facts had
never been revealed.
