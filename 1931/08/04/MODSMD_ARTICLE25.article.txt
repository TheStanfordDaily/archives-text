# A 						MONUMENT OF POSTCARDS
## 
### 
A Chicago woman is suing for divorce because her husband
lias devoted his life to amassing the world's most magnificent
collection of picture postcards, abandoning all else, including
her, to that ambition. He left her a year ago, she says, to go to
Elkhart, Indiana, to (ill a gap in his series. Now he is going to
Russia "to round out a memorable monument of postcards.
Well, regarding her as a woman with a woman's normal
desire for a happy home with a husband in it it she is married,
we may wish her good luck and a speedy divorce, which would
seemingly be good luck.
But looking at the matter in a bigger, broader, more cos
mically philosophic way, we pcrccive that her plight is only one
more of the little life-tragedies that fade into trivialities when
contrasted with the drive of a great objective that submerges all
else and makes them appear insignificant by comparison.
Scientists, artists, inventors, discoverers, golf players, all men
who move the world forward by their devotion to the idea of
achievement that grips them must devote themselves to Un
tiling that is bigger than they—and their women must suffer.
II may seem that the scholar so buried in his tracking down
of one little isolated fact that he forgets to go home to dinner
and the bridge party that he promised to attend has a warped
sense of proportion, but it is by the accumulation of all these
little isolated items of knowledge that the world has come to
know as much about itself as i( does, and keeps on finding out
that what it once thought it knew isn't so. No woman can be
allowed to interfere with that; if she can't stand it she can go
get herself a divorce.
