# PUT WORRY ON A MERRY-GO-ROUND

### 
On the occasion of Helen Wills Moody's victory over Helen
Jaeobs at Seabright, William ('.. ("Pop") Fuller, who coached
both Helen's to tennis eminence, complimented Queen Helen's
championship disposition: "I remember one clay in Golden
Gate Park when she was beaten in her first tournament. Instead
of pouting or crying, she turned to her father and asked him for
a quarter. 'I want to go on the merry-go-round,' she said. "Her
greatest attribute is her refusal to worry over a poor stroke or
the loss of a gnme."

Which brings to our "willie-nillied" brain, still slightly queer
from mid-quarters, the thought that maybe this merry-go-round
business isn't a half bad idea even for bookworms, and those
of us who, unlike Mrs. Moodv, do worry!
