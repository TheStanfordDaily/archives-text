The Editor, Sir:
I take my Corona in hand to write
you about your edi-TORO-ial of July
28. What you say arouses my ire. Why
all the advice to the Freshmen?
May I ask you to say a word to the
JUNIORS who come in from the li
brary at 2 o'clock in the morning or
wander promiscuously about Toyon at
three? Please ask them to leave their
boots behind and to close the doors
GENTLY. Please tell the Grads who
do their "singing in the showers" to do
it at 7 instead of at 5 a.m. Please tell
the SOPH who wants to speak to his
roommate, Tom, to talk to him confi
dentially in his room instead of run
ning down to the end of the corridor to
Jerry's room and then calling back to
Tom to answer. These halls reverbe
rate sounds like Th—under. We like
Henry's saxaphone and George's Sou
saphone at noon when we relax after
lunch, but please tell the seniors to
shut off their amplifiers on the Holly
wood-phones when they go 1o bed.
Please ask the mayor of 'Frisco to wear
rubber .heels when he delivers his
morning Cronic-les at 4 o'clock and to
deposit them- gently down before each
door—out of respect for the door. We
FRESHMEN who study till midnight
would like to sleep till 6, at least.
It might be well for the t)ean to give
an aptitude test on House Rules to
some of these upperclassmen, to de
termine their eligibility. We would like
to suggest that he send down a shingle
for their application. Out in Osceola,
where we come from, they teach these
little things in the schools—and in most
of the homes.
Respectfully,
A QUIET Freshman,

The Editor, Sir:
In the Palo Alto Times for Friday we
see in a letter to the editor a more than
usually belligerant misanthrope rising
from his murky depths to rant against
tne> vulgarity of O'Neill in the same
breath in which he calls all Stanford
men, especially fraternity men, swine
and foul-mouthed rounders. There is
also some wild talk of enough rope for
the administration and a certain de
partment of the faculty to hang itself
with.

Of course this violent reactionism de
feats itself, but there is another more
insidious type of unfriendly criticism
of the Stanford man and Stanford

The Editor, Sir:
I take my Corona in hand to write
you about your edi-TORO-ial of July
28. What you say arouses my ire. Why
all the advice to the Freshmen?
May I ask you to say a word to the
JUNIORS who come in from the li
brary at 2 o'clock in the morning or
wander promiscuously about Toyon at
three? Please ask them to leave their
boots behind and to close the doors
GENTLY. Please tell the Grads who
do their "singing in the showers" to do
it at 7 instead of at 5 a.m. Please tell
the SOPH who wants to speak to his
roommate, Tom, to talk to him confi
dentially in his room instead of run
ning down to the end of the corridor to
Jerry's room and then calling back to
Tom to answer. These halls reverbe
rate sounds like Th—under. We like
Henry's saxaphone and George's Sou
saphone at noon when we relax after
lunch, but please tell the seniors to
shut off their amplifiers on the Holly
wood-phones when they go 1o bed.
Please ask the mayor of 'Frisco to wear
rubber .heels when he delivers his
morning Cronic-les at 4 o'clock and to
deposit them- gently down before each
door—out of respect for the door. We
FRESHMEN who study till midnight
would like to sleep till 6, at least.
It might be well for the t)ean to give
an aptitude test on House Rules to
some of these upperclassmen, to de
termine their eligibility. We would like
to suggest that he send down a shingle
for their application. Out in Osceola,
where we come from, they teach these
little things in the schools—and in most
of the homes.
Respectfully,
A QUIET Freshman,
M. K.

The Editor, Sir:
In the Palo Alto Times for Friday we
see in a letter to the editor a more than
usually belligerant misanthrope rising
from his murky depths to rant against
tne> vulgarity of O'Neill in the same
breath in which he calls all Stanford
men, especially fraternity men, swine
and foul-mouthed rounders. There is
also some wild talk of enough rope for
the administration and a certain de
partment of the faculty to hang itself
with.

Of course this violent reactionism de
feats itself, but there is another more
insidious type of unfriendly criticism
of the Stanford man and Stanford
