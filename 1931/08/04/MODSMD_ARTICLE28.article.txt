TIIE MIRACLE WOMAN—At the Cali
fornia, Mayfield.
Shades of Aimee S. MePherson! This
show obviously is a noble effort 011
the part of the Hollywood producers
to capitalize on the recent splurge of
notoriety of the self-styled evangelist.
It is good, too, largely because of the
work of a new-comer, Barbara Stan
wyck.
She plays the part of the daughter
of a minister who has been crucilied
by his own congregation. In a spirit
of revenge on everything in general
and religion in particular, .she consents
to a plan, under high pressure by a
"natural-born manager • of anything,
anywhere" (Sam Hardy), to become a
miracle worker. The "miracles" arc
performed, the crowds throng the tab
ernacle, and the shekels pour into the
coffers.
A blind war ace, ex-Harvard, hap
pens along and the young "evangelist"
falls in love with him and out of love
with the sham life she is living. Dave
Manners plays the role of the blind
boy and his characterization is touch
ingly realistic.
A talking cartoon of Oswald ihr
Country Rabbit and an actually funny
comedy touched off the program.

drama that does much more harm and
no good in that it never quite reaches
the surface. By this, I refer to a few
misguided people who make it then
business to whisper behind the scenes
on all occasions about the • shocking
things we do and the*vulgar plays we
produce. These people base their opin
ions largely on hearsay and an over
emphasis of a few rarely occurring un
fortunate affairs which are never as
black as painted.
"The Hairy Ape" should not be called
a vulgar play. Even in its original un
cut form it contains no vulgar mention
of sex and very little profanity, and as
produced at Stanford all but a mini
mum of profanity—a few round "hells"
and "damns," —were cut.
As for the setting of the play, I see
no reason why it should be called vul
gar. It may be raw realism, it may be
crude in its powerful portrayal of a
fundamental part of our modern world
which we usually ignore, but it is still
intense, dramatic, and, as visioned by
O'Neill, full of deep rhythmic pathos.
It is the Emperor Jones with a white
skin and in a new setting — a man
whose tragic search for freedom and a
place where he "belongs" ends in pa
thetic oblivion. To take offense at this
is to admit to a near-sighted snobbery
which never will be able to appreciate
the real soul behind plain beauty.

"The Hairy Ape" should not be called
a vulgar play. Even in its original un
cut form it contains no vulgar mention
of sex and very little profanity, and as
produced at Stanford all but a mini
mum of profanity—a few round "hells"
and "damns," —were cut.
As for the setting of the play, I see
no reason why it should be called vul
gar. It may be raw realism, it may be
crude in its powerful portrayal of a
fundamental part of our modern world
which we usually ignore, but it is still
intense, dramatic, and, as visioned by
O'Neill, full of deep rhythmic pathos.
It is the Emperor Jones with a white
skin and in a new setting — a man
whose tragic search for freedom and a
place where he "belongs" ends in pa
thetic oblivion. To take offense at this
is to admit to a near-sighted snobbery
which never will be able to appreciate
the real soul behind plain beauty.

TIIE MIRACLE WOMAN—At the Cali

Shades of Aimee S. MePherson! This
show obviously is a noble effort 011
the part of the Hollywood producers
to capitalize on the recent splurge of
notoriety of the self-styled evangelist.
It is good, too, largely because of the
work of a new-comer, Barbara Stan
wyck.
She plays the part of the daughter
of a minister who has been crucilied
by his own congregation. In a spirit
of revenge on everything in general
and religion in particular, .she consents
to a plan, under high pressure by a
"natural-born manager • of anything,
anywhere" (Sam Hardy), to become a
miracle worker. The "miracles" arc
performed, the crowds throng the tab
ernacle, and the shekels pour into the
coffers.
A blind war ace, ex-Harvard, hap
pens along and the young "evangelist"
falls in love with him and out of love
with the sham life she is living. Dave
Manners plays the role of the blind

ingly realistic.
A talking cartoon of Oswald ihr
