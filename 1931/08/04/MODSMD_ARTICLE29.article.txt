The Barretts of Wimpole Street. A
Comedy in Five Acts. By Rudolf
Bi'iser. Little, Brown and Company,
Boston. 1931. (Al the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
The chronicle of one of the world's !
| favorite love stories, this play is ono of i
I the loveliest that modern England has
produced. It is based on two romances j
â€”that of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert
j Browning, and that of Elizabeth's sister,
j Henrietta, and a soldier.
Exquisite and sympathetic character
ization marks the play, those of Eliza
beth Barrett and Robert Browning be
j ing the most interesting. The fragile i
| loveliness of the invalid Elizabeth is j
| contrasted by the abundant strength |
j and vitality of Browning. Edward j
Moulton-Barrett, father of nine cnil-j
' dren, of whom Elizabeth is the eldest, ;
| is Mr. Beiscr's most careful and most j
I complete characterization, aside from
i the poets. He is a man "possessed," a j
I horrid despot in his home, passionately j
j resolved to keep his entire family un- !
J married, and secluded from the .
! world:" 1 His is a warped soul, a mind j
; unreasonable, and a cruel heart. Lack
! ing purity, he tortures in purity's name,
j making life, to his children, a condi-'
tion to be escaped.
I This is a play of some power, by
| reason of the subject matter and its j
I treatment. It is not a play to neglect, ;
for it is excellent and entertaining :
reading, besides having been produced .
j successfully both in Nl'W York and in I
; London. Kalherine Cornell first pro- j
I duced it in New York, under the di- i
I rection of Guthrie McClintic, herself
j playing the role of Elizabeth. The play
j has been running at the Empire Theater
j since its opening on February ( ), 1931.
