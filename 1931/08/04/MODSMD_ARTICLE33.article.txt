# FRESHMEN HARD AT WORK DURING SUMMER COMPETITION; ONLY FIFTY TO SURVIVE
## 
### 
In every freshman bull session hold j
in Toyon Hall during the lust six
weeks, the same question has been
asked, "How many freshmen are there
in the summer competition?"
No official figures have come from
the registrar's office, according to As
sistant Registrar Karl M. Cowdery, be
cause the final list has not been com
piled. Printed form cards will soon be j
sent out to all new students here for 1
the summer quarter, and they will be
asked to register on the cards whether
or not they wish to be placed on the
competing list.
The summer competition is a com
paratively new thing at Stanford, and
has been in operation for only a few
years. Students who have not been ac
cepted for the fall or winter quarters
may apply for admission to the sum
mer quarter, and if their scholastic
average for the summer places them â– 
within the first fifty, they are accepted !
for the fall quarter.
Competition Comparatively New
"The Committee on Admissions," said
Cowdery, "can not pick more than fixty
students from the competing list, but if i
the committee feels that the averages .
are not high enough, it can limit the
number of admissions-.at its own dis- j
cretion. During the last several years, '

however, the committee has never
drawn the line below fifty."
To the old-timers on the campus, it
seems strange to see the frosh and the
upper-classmen living together in the
s;me hall. The freshmen are not com
plaining, because they are getting ini
tiated into Stanford without the friend
ly help and assistance of the sophomore
class.
No Dinks Worn in Summer
They do not have to wear "dinks,"
they can do some queening over at the
Roble jolly-ups, and the fact that they
are living in Toyon Hall makes them
feel like upper-class men. They may
lack class spirit at the present time,
but next fall when they live in Encina
Hall it is expected that they will soon
make up for all their lost pep and
spirit.
The frosh are exceedingly jealous of
one another, and when one rushes over
to the hall or library to study, the rest
follow suit. If one room knocks off
work for an evening and goes into Palo
Alto to a show, the whole class takes
in the show. When one students gets an
"A" in history, the others study all
night.
It is just another old case of the
survival of the fittest, and may the best
fifty win.
