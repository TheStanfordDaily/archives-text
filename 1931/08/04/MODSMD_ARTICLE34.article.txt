# FIRST STANFORD YEARBOOK IS REVIEWED; FORTY-ONE SENIORS WERE IN 1895 "QUAD"
## 
### 
A record of the first four years at
Stanford, written by members of ihe
Pioneer Class of '95, is contained in
Volume I of the Stanford Quad, pub
lished in 1894 as the work of the junior
class, and edited by Abraham Lewis,
Jr., '95.
The volume was dedicated to the
"happy memory of Leland Stanford
Junior, whose early death opened for
us an avenue to higher life, in gratitude
and reverence." Mrs. Stanford was 'at
that time the only living member of
the Stanford family, the Senator hav
ing died a year before.
There were 41 seniors in 1894. Most
space was dedicated to the class of
1895, the first class to enter Stanford as
freshmen, and the class which insti
tuted the Quad. The opening of the
junior section contains the paragraph:
"When in future years the questions

shall be asked: 'Who set the example
of burning the midnight tallow in En
cina?' 'Who first decorated the tank?'
'Who invented the Stanford Quad?"
the echo of the past will answer: ' '95!' "
Other sections of the volume reveal
• the fact that in the years '91, '92, and
'93, Stanford defeated the University
j of California once in football, and tied
twice, that there were ten of the pres
; ent 24 fraternities, and three of the
j present nine sororities, also that many
attempts were made to create social
j life on the campus.
The volume contained advertisements
in the front as well as in the back, used
poetry in nearly every section, and had
few illustrations. The pages were about
half the size of those of modern Quads,
and the whole book contained 300
pages, whereas those of today usually
number nearly 500 pages.
