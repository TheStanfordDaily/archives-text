# GATHER FORMER GRID PLAYERS WHEN CZARS BAN USE OF VARSITY
## 
### 
Owing to a technicality in the rules
of the Pacific Coast Conference, "Pop"
Warner will be unable to use varsity
players in ihe filming of a series of
educational football short subjects.
However, in order to fulfill the con
tract, Warner has solicited the aid of
former Stanford gridiron luminaries
and nineteen have answered his call.
Conference officials reversed their
former ruling, which granted Warner
permission to use varsity players when
the date for production of the pictures
was set ahead from June 10 to Septem
ber 1. Certain members of the tcn
j ference objected to Stanford taking the
field two weeks before the regular
' practice opened and a ruling was found
j forbidding the issuance of equipment
before September 15.
In the absence c.f Warner, who is on
a fishing trip in the northwest, "Chuck"
Winterburn, has been gathering to
gether the graduate players. The re
sult promises the local appearance of
a group composed of many gridiron
heroes of the past few years whose
j names are synonymous with Stanford's
] football triurfiphs. No less than five
I all-Americans will appear in "Pop's"'
i movies.
Walt Heinecke, "Tiny" Post, Don
j Robesky, Ted Shipkey and Jim Law
son, all were picked by the leading au
thorities as being members of the
mythical team in their respective years.
The remainder of those signifying their
willingness to help Warner are: Horace
j Davidson, Eddie Marks, Sam Joseph,
I Mike Murphy, "Tiny" Sellman, Frank
Wilton, Dick Bogue, Leo Harris, Sher
man Crary, Hal McCreery, Ham Wil
son, Perry Taylor, Lud Frentrup, Glen
Hartranft and Ray Tandy. Invitations
have also been extended to Harlow
Rother, Seraphim Post and Harry Ship
| key.
The change in date of production has
made it impossible for Ernie Nevers to
j participate. He left recently for the
j East to organize his professional team
| and so will be unable to join his former
j team mates in putting the Warner
"System" on the screen.
