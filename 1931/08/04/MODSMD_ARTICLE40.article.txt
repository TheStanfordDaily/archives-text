### 
Sunday services in the Memorial
Church were conducted by the Right
Reverend Clinton S. Quinn, Episcopal
Bishop of Texas, at Houston.
The Reverend Quinn told what
Christians must face when they accept
Christ and Christianity. The sermon
was suggested by the remark of a
Rabbi to the effect that the Jewish re
ligion would stand though personali
ties were lost to it, but that the whole
Christian religion hinged upon Christ,
and that Christians, therefore, take the
risk of losing everything, should
Christ's existence be disproved.
