# IMRRESSIONISTIC TREATMENT AND CAPABLE ACTING IN "HAIRY APE" LAUDED BY AUDIENCE
## 
### Staff Reviewer 
| Significant for many reasons was
the successful production of Eugene
O'Neill's powerful play, "The Hairy
Ape," in the Assembly Hall on Friday
night.
The play itself has a significance, for
jit is O'Neill at his best. Though a
1 somewhat depressing pessimistic social
i criticism, which forgets culture in its
j powerful interpretation, the play is
nevertheless a fine example of the art
of the theater, of dramatic rhythm, and
'of patterned movement. It is one of
the most inevitable plays written;
events could not have happened other
than they did; only with the last mo
j ment of the play is the pattern com
plete. So much for what the dramatist
! contributed.
The production, under the direction
, of Harold Helvenston, was marked by
j a reserve which succeeded in main
! taining a happy balance between com
edy and tragedy, and in subordinating
the coarseness and brutality written
into the play, to the idea, which is,
| after all, paramount. A similar reserve
j on the part of Frederick Stover, tech
i nical director, prevented any of the
eight scenes from being ludicrous.
Sets Are Expressionistic
The sets were frankly expressionistic
I suggestions of mood and locale; back
i grounds for the action. Both Helven
ston and Stover took their cues from
the dramatist himself in directing and
i designing the production in an expres
\ sionistic rather than a naturalistic man
| ncr.
' The production dropped into but a
( few of the pitfalls to which an amateur
: production is liable. These hardly no
ticeable failings were a result merely
| of the unavoidable immaturity of the
players. No three-act play of O'Neill
j has ever before been attempted at
! Stanford, and courage is required of
; director and actors in such an under
[ taking, for even O'Neill is not fool
proof.
Acting laurels go, of course, to Peter

f Heiser, whose interpretation of "Yank"
won spontaneous and honest apprecia
tion from the audience. His perform
| ance may be credited to genuine and
j intelligent effort rather than to dra-
I matic genius.
Gratifying Interpretation Given
Lacking, with the rest of the cast, the
' years and experience required f<#r a
I mature, polished, and thoroughly con
| vincing protection, Heiser, under the
j careful direction of Helvenston, gave a
j surprising and a gratifying interpreta
! tion of the man who didn't belong to
' civilization, who died trying to find the
place he had lost when he began to
think.
As Paddy, sentimental old Irish
stoker, Carl Cartwright walked away
with parts of the two scenes in which
he carried the lines.
Short but enjoyable bits were con
tributed by Catherine Crary as Mildred
Douglas, who inspired "Yank's" wrath,
and by Dorothea Johnson, as the girl's
aunt.
A Symbolic Fifth Avenue Scene
An excellent bit of acting was dis
played in the symbolic Fifth avenue
scene by Joseph Whitaker, as the cold,
entirely self-contained aristocrat, with
all the courage of his class. He looked,
not like a college youth on Fifth ave
nue, but like a true New Yorker.
Herbert Jones, Everett Baker, Waldo
Salt, Fred Long, Eri Richardson, Law
rence Clarke, Harvey Hall, Donald Lat
man, and Darrell Ross, all played well
their small bits which were so essen-'
tial to the play, as did a number of
others.
Friday's audience responded to the
; effectiveness of the stoke-hole scene
; with enthusiasm, clearly enjoyed the
1 half-burlesque scene between the girl
and her aunt, and held its breath dur
ing the climatic moments of the eighth
J scene. It expressed delight with the
sets, and with the acting, but whether
the subtleties which went into the pro
duction were lost entirely remains a
j moot question.
