# WATER CONSUMPTION LIMITED TO PUMPED SUPPLY FROM WELLS
## 
### 
Campus consumption of water has
I been limited to that pumped from
; wells, thus lessening the water pres
â–  sure for the week. That the water
j shortage problem facing the Univer
; sity continues unabated and will prob
| ably remain in such state until the
| autumn lT.ins, is the opinion of J. W.
McDonnell, assistant superintendent of
j buildings and grounds.
In reviewing the situation, McDon
nell declared that because of light rain
fall and the consequent small runoff,
only 160 million gallons of water were
impounded this season to meet a nor
mal demand of over 400 million gallons.
Stanford ordinarily does not depend
j on her underground water supply for
j irrigation, but this season's unprece
dented drought has made it necessary
to rely on the wells. A marked dpcline
J in the production of the entire Santa
! Clara Valley underground supply has
! been noted.
McDonnell stressed the necessity for
! a sufficient supply of water for fire
protection which must be on hand at
all times. He further stated that at Ihe
I present time there is. only 77 million
j gallons in storage in Searsville and Felt
; lakes, and at the present rate of con
j sumption this water will last only about
| 120 days.
"Since the last two years have had
|no runoff until March, the necessity
for conserving this year's supply
against such emergency should be ap
j parent to all," said McDonnell.
