# UNIVERSITY TRAFFIC ISLAND PLAN SCORED BY CHIEF OF POLICE
## 
### 
Opposing University authorities who
are experimenting with the triangular
"island" for splitting the traffic into
two lanes at the intersection of Palm
Drive and EI Camino Real, Howard
Zink, Palo Alto chief of police, claims
that the plan "sacrifices efficiency and
safety to a problematical aesthetic
value."
In the view of Chief Zink, ineffi
ciency would result because the "island"'
formation "allows cars to enter the in
tersection in the rear of the normal
stopping point of machines on the
highway and it creates confusion as to
which is the proper lane for use."
Safety is sacrificed, he said, because
it is "difficult to define clearly the
exact working in such a complicated
traffic system" and also because "it in
creases the problem of pedestrians who
wish to cross the highway, since they
have to cross on a diagonal line, which
increases the time they are in' jeop
ardy."
Last week in an interview Gordon
Davis, "Campus cop" said, "I'm all
in favor of the split lanes, for such a
system, when fully constructed would
relieve congestion and promote safety."
According to "Hoy H. Button, super
intendent of buildings and grounds, the
"island" was created as an experiment
to settle just this point. Final decision
on the plan will be made upon the re
turn of Comptroller A. E. Roth from
his European trip sometime during the
middle of this month.
