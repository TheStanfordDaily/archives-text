### 
Pictures in color of the magnificent
: Bavarian Alps were the high spots in
| the illustrated lecture on "Beautiful
! South Germany," given last night in
the Little Theater by Dr. Reinald
j Hoops. This was the second of a series
' of five lectures which is being given
on Monday evenings by Dr. Hoops,
i who is acting assistant professor of
German, from the University of Glas
; gow.
Taking his audience on an imaginary
1 trip through Southern Germany, off the
i beaten track of tourists, Hoops began
| showing slides of Heidelberg and its
I famous Castle. A few scenes of Heidel
-1 berg University life showed a typical
Heidelberg fraternity house. The deeo
i rated walls of the university jail dis
! closed valuable and amusing pictures,
i and inscriptions and autographs of all
1 those who had spent time there.
From Heidelberg the imaginary holi
day trip led to the Black Forest, known
j for its dark and extensive pine woods,
| its numerous lakes and waterfalls, and
| its meadows.
Freiburg, home of a Gothic cathe
dral, stupendous city gates, and a uni
| versity, was the scene of the next visit,
j From there Hoops transported his au
-1 dience to Lake Constance.
Extensive views of the Bavarian Alps
i in color featured much of the lecture.
Typical features of the Alps, lakes cind
little villages, and high, steep, wooded
hills rising out of the lakes, were
shown. These Alps are particularly
j known for the blueness of their lakes
and the beauty of their sunsets, the
speaker said.
Dr. Hoops described the picturesque
little towns, saying that no possible
j roads could be built around the lakes,
so steep were the hills which rose out
! of them, the only transportation being
by boat. Villages exist high in the
Alps, where the people are cut off from
'the world, and are happy and serious
minded, existing on daily products, and
by the work of their own hands.
The Bavarian Alps, according to
Hoops, are popular for winter spotts.
He showed innumerable scenes of the
snow-topped mountains, and miniature
like villages in the valleys. The pic
! tures of the Alpine peaks included one
i in color of the rare but magnificent
"Alpine glowing," a pink coloration of
the peaks long after the sun has set.
"Education in Germany" will be the
subject of the next lecture, which will
I be given in the Little Theater next
! Monday evening, August 10, at 8
o'clock.

He showed innumerable scenes of the
snow-topped mountains, and miniature
like villages in the valleys. The pic
! tures of the Alpine peaks included one
i in color of the rare but magnificent
"Alpine glowing," a pink coloration of
the peaks long after the sun has set.
"Education in Germany" will be the
subject of the next lecture, which will
I be given in the Little Theater next
! Monday evening, August 10, at 8
o'clock.
Pictures in color of the magnificent
: Bavarian Alps were the high spots in
| the illustrated lecture on "Beautiful
! South Germany," given last night in
the Little Theater by Dr. Reinald
j Hoops. This was the second of a series
' of five lectures which is being given
on Monday evenings by Dr. Hoops,
i who is acting assistant professor of
German, from the University of Glas
; gow.
Taking his audience on an imaginary
1 trip through Southern Germany, off the
i beaten track of tourists, Hoops began
| showing slides of Heidelberg and its
I famous Castle. A few scenes of Heidel
-1 berg University life showed a typical
Heidelberg fraternity house. The deeo
i rated walls of the university jail dis
! closed valuable and amusing pictures,
i and inscriptions and autographs of all
1 those who had spent time there.
From Heidelberg the imaginary holi
day trip led to the Black Forest, known
j for its dark and extensive pine woods,
| its numerous lakes and waterfalls, and
| its meadows.
Freiburg, home of a Gothic cathe
dral, stupendous city gates, and a uni
| versity, was the scene of the next visit,
j From there Hoops transported his au
-1 dience to Lake Constance.
Extensive views of the Bavarian Alps
i in color featured much of the lecture.
Typical features of the Alps, lakes cind
little villages, and high, steep, wooded
hills rising out of the lakes, were
shown. These Alps are particularly
j known for the blueness of their lakes
and the beauty of their sunsets, the
speaker said.
Dr. Hoops described the picturesque
little towns, saying that no possible
j roads could be built around the lakes,
so steep were the hills which rose out
! of them, the only transportation being
by boat. Villages exist high in the
Alps, where the people are cut off from
'the world, and are happy and serious
minded, existing on daily products, and
by the work of their own hands.
The Bavarian Alps, according to
Hoops, are popular for winter spotts.
