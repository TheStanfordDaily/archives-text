# PATIENT PRACTICE NECESSARY FOR GOOD MEMORY SAYS PROFESSOR WARNER BROWN
## 
### 
"By patient practice and with a little
i time individuals can improve their
memories. The reason why most people
j have poor memories is because they
have never tried to improve them,"
| was the statement made by Warner
I Brown, acting professor of psychology
at the University of California, in his
lecture on "Training the Memory"
given Tuesday evening in the Little
Theatre.
"Most of us," continued the speaker,
j "are either too lazy to develop our
memories or else in despair we assume
! that nature has been unkind to us in
1 bestowing poor memory abilities."
Simonides Founded Cult
In tracing the history of the theory
of memory training Brown declared
j that Cicero considered Simonides as
j the founder of the memory cult. Si
| monides was attending a banquet one
day and when called from the room for
i a short time he returned to find that
j the roof had caved in and killed ail of
i the banquetors. He was able to identi
| fy the remains because he couid re
member where each one had been sit
ting. This incident, it is believed, was
l Ihe origin of the school that makes use
| of positions in space to aid in memor

izing.
"In its more sophisticated form this
system developed into what is known
as the 'warehouse' system in which an
item to be remembered is mentally lo
cated in one particular room of a
building," Brown said.
"Experiments have demonstrated that
it is easier to recall things when they
are identified with space.
No Faculty of Memory
"There is no faculty of memory.
One's memory can be improved only
by practice. Retentiveness is a pri
mary trait and it is only by memory
training that we can develop our re
tentive powers."
"We must do three things in order
to improve our memories," said Brown.
"In the first place, we must have more
systematic observation and fixation, be
cause casual observation is fruitless. In
Ihe second place, we must employ a
more systematic association, that is,
make use of similarities and contrasts
of the things to be remembered. In
the third place, a more systematic rec
ollection plan must be used. This is
accomplished by going back through
the processes used in learning because
active recollection is always preferable
to passive impression."
