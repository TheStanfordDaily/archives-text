ternational Affairs, which was held at

I and Cambridge, from the provincial i
j British universities, and from the

"International Regional Organizations"?
McClintock's commission was the one i
on disarmament.

eral survey of world conditions at the J
present time, expressed itself as of the j
i opinion that there are very strong
| grounds for attempting a limitation and j
reduction of armaments, at the World j
Disarmament Conference in 1932.
In regard to peace treaties, the con- j
ference decided that a revision on a j
• basis of reciprocity is a necessary pre
j limiliary to any closer co-operation be
tween the European powers. The con-
I ference further declared itself in favor
of the Austro-German Customs Union,
J and opposed to any plan which tends
1 to weaken the League of Nations. These
i resolutions were passed after a discus
| sion of current conditions in post-war
Euiope.
