# German Education Topic of Next Lecture
## Dr. Reinald Hoops Scheduled To Speak Monday 
### 
"Education in Germany" will be the
topic of Dr. Reinald Hoops' lecture at
8 o'clock Monday evening' in the Lit
tle Theatre. The ideals of education
in the Germany of the post-war period
will be discussed, and Dr. Hoops will
give a sketch of the German educa
tional system from the elementary
schools up to the universities.
As a result of his experience in
America, Dr. Hoops will be prepared
to compare the German system with
the American and to criticize the short
comings of the latter.
The lecture is designed especially for
the students of education, for whom it
should have a particular interest,
though the speaker says it will be of a
type which will appeal to the under
standing and interest of the general
public.
Dr. Hoops, who is acting assistant
professor of German for the summer
quarter, teaches German at the Uni
versity of Glasgow. His own education
was acquired at the University of Ber
lin and at Heidelberg, where his
father is professor of Anglistics.
Monday's lecture will be the third
of a series of five lectures on Germany
which Dr. Hoops is giving each week
in the Little Theatre. The first two
lectures were "Young Germany" and
"Beautiful South Germany." Two
others will be given, one on modern
German architecture and the last one
cn Oberammergau.
