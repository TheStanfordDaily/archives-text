# "PETITS BOURGEOIS" DEPICTED IN FRENCH DEPARTMENT DRAMA
## 
### 
"La Gloire Ambulanciere," by Tris
tan Bernard, was presented in the Lit
tle Theatre last night, under the direc
tion of Miss Adele Jallade, by a cast
composed of faculty and students in
the French department.

The play, which deals with a petty
family of French 'pctits bourgeois"
which is summoned by the illness of a
woman relative, is a comedy, showing
how such people keep, in the midst of
confusion, all their foolish habits and
egotisms, open rivalries and half-con
cealed intrigues.
J. A. Bede, as the husband of the sick
woman, played his amusing to the
complete satisfaction of the audience.
The other parts were taken by Thomas
Vasey, Carl McDowell, Richard Fronk,
F. O. Tostenson, Henri Gregoire, Eliza
beth Barbou, Catherine Musante, Cath
erine Crary, and Jacqueline De Wit.
Preceding the play, Catherine Mu
sante sang the "Aria du Printemps de
'Samson et Dalia'," by St. Saens, and
"Chanson de Florian," by Godard.
Following the "Gloire Ambulanciere,"
a skit burlesquing the oral examina
tion required for a doctorate was pre
sented by Henri Gregoire and F. O.
Tostenson. The act dealt with a Eu
ropean who wished to form an opinion
of America, and whose friend subjected
himself to an oral examination on such
topics as prohibition, pajamas, and the
meaning of Stanford's "Weeping An
gel." The cast of the preceding play
acted as the jury, and their questions
and the replies were all in verse.
As a conclusion to the program, Pro
fessor Gregoire read a poem which he
had written, on California.
