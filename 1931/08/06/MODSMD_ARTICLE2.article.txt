# BOOK STORE DISPLAYS PLATES WITH SCENES OF STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
The long awaited service plates, de
picting scenes of the Stanford campus,
are now here. These plates were made
at the Spode works in Staffordshire,
England, from photographs of the cam
pus taken by Berton M. Crandall, '07,
Palo Alto photographer. Mrs. Chloe
Leslie Starks, associate professor of
graphic art, designed the border, which
is an arrangement of the arcade and
Palo Alto tree.
Each plate bears a different view of
the campus, twelve making a complete
set. The views include the Palo Alto
tree, Inner Quad, Memorial Church,
Administration Building, Toyon Hull,
Library, East Arch, Union, Palm Drive,
Jordan Hall, and Arcade.
J. E. McDowell, alumni secretary,
who has charge of the sale of the
plates, says that 500 dozen were or
dered and 125 advance orders have al
ready been filled. This custom among
universities was started by Yale and
Harvard in 1928 and since that time
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and several
other universities have taken it up.
During the first year Harvard disposed
of 5,000 dozen plates among collectors

and alumni

There has been a two-months' delay
in receiving the plates due to the tact
that 75 dozen were lost when the coast
freighter, which was to carry them
here, was burned in New York harbor.

The plates are now on display at the
Stanford Bookstore and the Homeware
store in Palo Alto.
