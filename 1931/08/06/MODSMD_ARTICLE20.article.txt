# ALMACK STATES REFORM NEEDED IN UNIVERSITIES
## New Universities Will Have Professional Schools, No Lower Division More Scientific Approach Is Needed In Experiments Says Professor 
### 
Universities that will be composed
j of a group of professional schools, that
will be strictly scientific in their alti
tude, and that will not include a lower
division—such will be the universities
; of the future if they are to be the in
tellectual leaders they should be. This
! is the belief of Dr. J. C. Alinack of the
School of Education, who was the prin
i cipal speaker at the last summer
meeting of the Education Club, Tues
day noon.
Likening the traditional university
i attitude to the motto of the old Span
! ish kings, "Nothing More Beyond," Dr.
Almack reviewed briefly the few
changes that have taken place in uni
versity education. The first real change
in higher education, he declared, came
jin Germany when some of the uni
j versities there aopted the Baconian
I method. The influence of those inno
vations spread to this country, it was
pointed out, and resulted in what was
said to be the greatest reform or addi
tion ever made in higher education, the
attempt to improve scientifically the
agricultural and mechanical arts. Dr.
i Almack stated his belief that the in
i troduction of this change pointed the
j way to other necessary changes.
Modern Experiments Unscientific
In speaking of modern experiments
!in university education, Dr. Almack
stated that they are, for the most part,
I unscientific and will not be fruitful of
i results. The Mikeljohn experiment at
| Wisconsin he characterized as being il
! luminating principally to show the ex
! tent to which personal malice will be
carried. The Chicago experiment he
spoke of as being useless since no one
will be able to tell whether the plan is
better or worse than other plans.
"The remedy lies in introducing into
! the universities the true causes of
I progress," Dr. Almack continued. "The
true essentials of a scientific institu
tion will include the discovery, the ap
plication, and the diffusion of knowl
edge." • ■
Features of New University
The speaker concluded his talk by
giving a series of "planks" or princi
ples upon which the modern university
should be founded. These include lim
iting university education to superior
students who have definite and serious
purpose, confining it to specialized edu
cation, divorcing the university from a
lower division, having the professional
school as the unit, and introducing
i more freedom for the individual stu-
I dent.

j of the meeting, introduced Dr. Almack.

pointed out, and resulted in what was
said to be the greatest reform or addi
tion ever made in higher education, the
attempt to improve scientifically the
agricultural and mechanical arts. Dr.
i Almack stated his belief that the in
i troduction of this change pointed the
j way to other necessary changes.
Modern Experiments Unscientific
In speaking of modern experiments
!in university education, Dr. Almack
stated that they are, for the most part,
I unscientific and will not be fruitful of
i results. The Mikeljohn experiment at
| Wisconsin he characterized as being il
! luminating principally to show the ex
! tent to which personal malice will be
carried. The Chicago experiment he
spoke of as being useless since no one
will be able to tell whether the plan is
better or worse than other plans.
"The remedy lies in introducing into
! the universities the true causes of
I progress," Dr. Almack continued. "The
true essentials of a scientific institu
tion will include the discovery, the ap
plication, and the diffusion of knowl
edge." • ■
Features of New University
The speaker concluded his talk by
giving a series of "planks" or princi
ples upon which the modern university
should be founded. These include lim
iting university education to superior
students who have definite and serious
purpose, confining it to specialized edu
cation, divorcing the university from a
lower division, having the professional
school as the unit, and introducing
i more freedom for the individual stu-
I dent.
Miss Gertrude H. Babcock, chairman
j of the meeting, introduced Dr. Almack.

Universities that will be composed
j of a group of professional schools, that
will be strictly scientific in their alti
tude, and that will not include a lower
division—such will be the universities
; of the future if they are to be the in
tellectual leaders they should be. This
! is the belief of Dr. J. C. Alinack of the
School of Education, who was the prin
i cipal speaker at the last summer
meeting of the Education Club, Tues
day noon.
Likening the traditional university
i attitude to the motto of the old Span
! ish kings, "Nothing More Beyond," Dr.
Almack reviewed briefly the few
changes that have taken place in uni
versity education. The first real change
in higher education, he declared, came
jin Germany when some of the uni
j versities there aopted the Baconian
I method. The influence of those inno
vations spread to this country, it was
pointed out, and resulted in what was
said to be the greatest reform or addi
tion ever made in higher education, the
attempt to improve scientifically the
agricultural and mechanical arts. Dr.
i Almack stated his belief that the in
