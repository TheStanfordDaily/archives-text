# HIGH SCHOOLS AND TRAINING FOR CULTURE
## 
### 
One of Ihe more startling statenienls made by Will G. Wood
in his address al the Education banquet recently was to the
effect that business today wants of the schools character and
intelligence, plus a general education, more strongly than it
wants specialized training. Coining from a man who has at
tained eminence in both the field of education and business,
the statement is worth consideration.
Here is not a disgruntled university professor protesting
against the lack of cultural training and background he tinds in
the underclassmen he teaches. It cannot be construed, on the
other hand, as the familiar plea for the reinstatement in the
curriculum of compulsory Greek and Latin. It is merely the
observation of a man who has an opportunity to see the prod
ucts of present day schools in action. It is a warning against
over-specialization in secondary schools.
The statement is a little unusual, coming from a business
man. However, it has been heard often in university circles.
An article in a recent number of School and Society, written
evidently by a faculty .member of the University of Colorado,
presents a slightly rabid attitude toward the modern high school
curricula. After referring to the "diluting" of the courses of
study with industrial, economic, and artistic subjects, and extra
curricular activities, he goes on to say that "high school stu
dents, it must be admitted, accepted the new order of things
with pronounced enthusiasm. They govern themselves with
fine, artistic abandon of traditional prejudices. They have de
veloped a high proficiency as movie, radio, and baseball fans.
They have learned to dance, play football and hockey, drink,
and, on occasion, commit adultery. Their culture in the Freu
dian sense, has notably increased."
It is evident that, .to this writer, cultural trainingâ€”the sort
that Mr. Wood spoke of as building character and intelligence -
means the traditional classical school subjects. Where the pres
ent day educator would take exception is in the subjects which
must be taught to inoculate this "culture." lie would agree,
with some reservations probably, to Mr. Wood's statement, but
he would also insist that character and intelligence can be de
veloped without teaching Greek and Latin, or even without
algebra and geometry.
Perhaps specialization has begun too early and high schools
should give more general training. That is another problem.
It should be remembered, however, that the present high school
reflects to a large extent the needs of the people it serves, and
that it is not the creation of any school man's brain. If condi
tions prove that a change is necessary, the high school will
make that change.
