# REMEDY NEEDED IN CITIZENSHIP TESTS

It seems that the Citizenship instructors have the habit of
giving the same examinations to two different hours. It is only
natural that the students having the examination first should
let the news leak out to their fellow-frosh in the other section.
The situation raises two major dillieulties. First a technical
point is opened as to whether or not the giving or receiving
such information intentionally or unintentionally is a violation
of the honor code. Be that as it may, the second difficulty is
of more importance to the freshman—grades in these two sec
tions are based upon an average of both sections. Thus it is
easy to see that the first section is at a huge disadvantage since
it is legimate to expect that the later section will have higher
grades than the first as they have had time to think about the
examination.
A remedy would be for the instructors to give each section
a different examination. This is directly in line with the in
structions given out to all professors and instructors which
advise, if not command, the use of different examinations for
alternate seats when the members of the class must sit next to
each other on account of lack of room to sit at least one seat
apart.
