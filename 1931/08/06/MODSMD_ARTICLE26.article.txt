# ONE OF NATURE'S BEAUTY SECRETS LEAKS OUT
## 
### 
An item in last evening's Palo Alto Times —and for all we
know, il may he one of those hits of information of such uni
versal significance that il has heen distributed t<» some syndi
cate's entire list of clients sets forth that "ordinary fruit jelly
applied to the face is said to he a first-class heautv prepara
tion.''

Thus once more is demonstrated the fad that frequently
savages and undeveloped people through some unexplained
natural intuition hit upon practices that lagging science later
discovers are exactly adapted to the desirable end.
Take this discovery of the excellence of jelly externally ap
plied as a cosmetic, for example. How many of our beautiful
women have unconsciously attained their glory through the
practice, while they were undeveloped little people, of applying
jellies and jams to their whole countenances? Hut, though
charm is rightly prized and sought bv women, somehow this
particular beauty preparation seems better adapted to the days
of childhood than later.
Peaches and cream is all right as an achievement in com
plexion, but the thought of a young woman smearing her cheeks
and lovely brow with eomnieslibles well, let her preserve her
good looks by all reasonable means, but not by peach preserve,
"applied to the face."
University dining hall patrons complain that the food is
monotonous. Dr. George Luckelt finds that men who eat else
where fail to secure sufficient variety for health.
