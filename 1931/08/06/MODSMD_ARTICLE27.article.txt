"I say I love you well, why ask for
more?"
"I ask no more, —just reason for that
love."
"Will this suffice? I swear by God
above."
"No, stop. All swearing's trite, and is
a bore."
"O, dove, wern't vows bestowed in an
cient lore?"
"But times do change—and know, I'm
not your dove."
"My pigeon then? Ah, love's so hard
to prove."
"But proof's my price; my heart's not
yours before."
"I love you for your hair is like the
sun."
"Today you curst the sun as 'hellish
hot'."
"I love you for your eyes are full of
fun."
"You said the same of sister's tiny
tot."
"I love you, for—l love you because
I do."
"That reason's good;—and that's why
I love you."
These "poems of the week" appear
in every Thursday's paper.
