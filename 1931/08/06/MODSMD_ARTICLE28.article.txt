### 
"Byzantium and the Bulgarians" was
the subject of ihe lecture given yester
day afternoon by Professor Henri
Gregoire, as one of his series of talks
in French under the general heading
of "Byzantine Culture and Civiliza
tion."
Professor Gregoire declared that if
Byzantium was unable to fulfill its
task of extending and (Consolidating
Greek in the Balkans, it was due to
the fact that it met, in the country
south of the Danube, a fearful advers
ary, the Bulgars, or Bulgarians, a peo
ple of Turkish stock, who adopted the
Slavonic language of the numerous Slav
tribes which had spread over the whole
peninsula since the beginning of the
seventh century.
Professor Gregoire gave a short and
vivid account of the long struggle be
tween Byzantium and the Bulgars. He
showed how the emperors proved able
to avert the main danger, the capture
of Constantinople, which if taken be
fore the Turkish invasion would have
brought about the fall of the huge
civilized and Christian empire of the
East.
The speaker dwelt upon episodes of
that fierce struggle, emphasizing the
characters of the Bulgarian king, Sy
meon, and of the Byzantine emperor,
Basil the Second, who succeeded in
halting the advance of the Bulgarians.
Professor Gregoire concluded his lec
ture by showing how the story of the
destruction of the Bulgarian empire by
the Byzantines gave rise to the legend
which served as a basis for the story
used by Shakespeare in the "Tempest."

Gregoire will lecture in English, on the
"Byzantine Epic."
