j Editor of The Daily, Dear Sir:
This morning's letter with its mani
; fold capital letters and its alleged pans
! strikes us as being a most unworthy
i effort to calumniate the exemplary be
j havior of the older and more dignified
I inhabitants of Toyon Hotel.
We would suggest that the author of
the said epistle, if he really be what he
says he is, a quiet freshman, should
forthwith set about to arrange the erec
tion of a monument to himself as trie
sole example of a hitherto unsuspected
species, for in truth such a thing has
existed not within the memory of man.
However, we are somewhat appeased
by the fact that he makes no exces
sively scurrilous attacks upon the
seniors, of whose number we are one,
and in addition, we would recommend
that the said benighted freshman buy
j for himself cotton to be stuffed in his
! ears, that the many noises he has heard,
| which may no doubt be attributed to
| the crickets, shall no longer disturb (lie
i sanctity of his repose.
Respectfully submitted,
