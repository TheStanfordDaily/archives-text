One of the finest collegiate outdoor
swimming plants in the country, in the
opinion of Swimming Coach Norton
Thornton, will be open for inspection
Wednesday, August 12, when the an
nual summer aquatic meet will be
held. He states that this will *be the
only opportunity this summer that
women on the campus will have to see
the pools, and urges that they attend
the meet.
The Encina pools have been con
structed in three units, a shallow pool
for beginners, the diving pool, and the
varsity tank. The diving pool is twelve
feet deep, sixty feet long by forty feet
wide. It is surrounded by four spring
boards and two diving platforms. The
beginners section measures sixty feet
by thirty-seven, and has a depth of
four feet. The largest pool, the varsity
water-polo tank, is seventy-five by
forty and has a depth of six feet.
Modern filters and other sanitary
provisions maintain the purity of the
water at all times. The temperature
is carefully regulated, being checked
at frequent intervals by the attendants.
An added feature of the plant is a sand
pit and apparatus used for instruction
in diving.
Thornton states that the meet prom
ises to be one of the best ever held
during a Stanford summer quaiter.
