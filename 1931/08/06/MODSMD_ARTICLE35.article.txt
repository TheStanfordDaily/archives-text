"The cup is seven and one-half
inches high and six and one-half
inches wide at the widest point, and is
in three parts," Mosley says. "There
is. an inner part, an outer part, and
the base. The outer cup was sculptured
in relief by a Greek working after the
manner of the great sculpturer Skopas.
On the outside there are branches con
structed in such a way as to make
twelve loops, and in each loop there is
a human figure identified as Christ and
his followers. It is dated at the first
century A.D.
"The inner cup is a plain, inartistic,
drinking cup made of silver, but from
the elaborate way in which it was pre

the Holy Grail.
"Fearing that the cup might fall into
the hands of the Germans at the first

New York by its owners.
