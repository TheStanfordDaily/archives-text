# FROSH HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR; HAZING, MUD TILTS, AND SCARE POSTERS PAST AND GONE
## 
### 
Visiting students here for the sum
mer quarter declare themselves sur
prised at the utter lack of hazing and
il! feeling between the freshman and
sophomore classes. They can not un
derstand the fact that first year stu
dents and upper-class men live to
gether in the same hall.
Stanford was one of the first col
leges on the Pacific coast to take a de
cided attitude against hazing, and in
1907 took definite steps to abolisn lower
class fights and brawls.
In 1904 the freshmen and sophomores
held their first organized inter-class
battle in the showers and bath tubs of
Encina Hall. The frosh claimed a
moral victory.
Rugby Football in 1906
In 1906 the two lower classes held a
rush in the form of a rugby football
game played on the varsity lield.
About a hundred men played on each
side. Five minutes before the end of
the game, the sophomores made a
touchdown, and then with the aid of
fifty upper-classmen ertlisted late in
the game they scored again. The foot
ball games were soon discontinued be
cause the freshmen protested; dec.'ar
ing them unfair, as they were not
given a sporting chance. The upper
classmen were always appointed to act
as judges, and when the tide of battle
seemed about to go against the sophs,
ihcy would lend their physical support
and help trounce the frosh.
As a result, the class football game
was discontinued in .1907 and the tie-up
was substituted. During the second
week of the quarter, the sophomores
and freshmen would meet on the var
sity football field in organized groups.
Each of the contestants was supplied
with a four foot piece of soft rope, and
at a given signal would rush out in the
center of the field and proceed to tie
each" other up. After a half hour of
strenuous fighting, the upper-class
judge would fire a shot, and the class
that had the most men tied up would
be declared the winner. When a man
was tied up and carried to the
"morgue," he was supposed to be out
of the battle, but many a second-year
man was untied by the seniors and
went back into the fray to help uphold
the honor of his class.
Poster Fights Are Started
In 1910 the class battles resulted in
the birth of the famous Stanford pos
ter fights. The night before the annual
tie-up, a group of freshmen were on
their way home to Encina Hall from
San Jose when they discovered a car
full of posters for the sophomore class
which they promptly captured and de
stroyed. Hearing of the capture, the
sophs hurried to San Jose, got the
printer out of bed and had him run
off a new set of placards in time to get
them distributed on the campus be
fore dawn. The freshmen, not to be
outdone, had the same printer make a
set of posters denouncing their rivals.
That evening the two classes wont

into camp in the hills back of the i
President's mansion, and at 2 o'clock in !
the morning the rival armies staged 1
their battle on the lawns at the end of '
the fraternity row. The fight was again
supervised by the older men, and the
class that was declared the winner pro
ceeded to tear down the posters of its
rival. The class tie-up always took
place the afternoon following the poster
fight and Row battle.
Last Tie-up in 1922
The last tie-up and poster fight was
held in 1922. Feeling ran so high, and
hazing continued so long after the an
nual tie-up was over, that a commit
tee of seniors was appointed by tne
University to regulate and govern the
lower class battles. The committee rec
ommended a mud fight, and in 1923 the
first mud tilt was held in an especially
prepared hole in the dry bottom of
Lake Lagunita.
Every year the rivalry in the mud
fights was becoming greater, and more
students were getting hurt, so in 1928
the fight was abolished in favor of the
present tie-up. The tie-up is conducted
and judged by the Encina sponsors and
Block "S" men and closely follows the
rules used in the contest of 1907. No
fights or skirmishes are permitted be
fore the tie-up, and after the contest is
over, any violations of the rules are
taken care of by the sponsors or the
Men's Council.
