# DIETS OF STANFORD MEN LACK VARIETY SAYS PROF. LUCKETT
## 
### 
"After an examination of the diet
j charts of Stanford men, I find the main
j trouble to be in the monotony of their
| daily foods," says Professor George S.
Luckett, of the Stanford Hygiene Do
i partment. "The same foods are eaten
| "Say after day and not enough variety
|is included. Potatoes, meats, gravies,
j and milk shakes seem to compose the
I greater portion of the meals. Especially
j is this true where the men have a free
j choice."

J Professor Luckett's statement is I
based on a three-day diet chart mode j
j out each quarter by all men registered J
j in Hygiene 150 and 151. He stales that ,
! over two thousand of these charts have j
i now been accumulated and a study will
; soon be made to find out what :'s lack
j ing in the diet of Stanford men. These
I charts are made, he says, not as a sci- I
j entific research but merely as a prac
tical test.
It is found that a majority of men on
i the campus eat an excess of fats, which
| is probably due to the heavy consump- '
I tion of butter and milk shakes. Their i
j diets are usually lacking in starches |
; and carbohydrates, which condition can I
j be averted through the eating of frcah J
I fruits and vegetables.
"I find that instead of eating fruit
between meals it is usually a milk j
i shake that the Stanford man consumes,"
says Luckett.
"The diets of men eating at the dor
mitories and eating clubs seems to be
fairly well regulated, but the men do
not always eat the variety of foods pre- j
; sented them. I have also found that
| men who are outstanding athletes have
: a very well balanced diet, which is
I quite a necessary part of their train- !
i ing. It is among men living off campus j
j and in places where their diet is not i
I regulated that I find the greatest dis- I
I crepancies."
