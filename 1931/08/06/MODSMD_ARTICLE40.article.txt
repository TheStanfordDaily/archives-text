# LAWS MUST BE TRIED AFTER BEING PASSED SAYS J. W. MADDEN

''It would be just as sensible to have
the majority of the past generation
make the laws as to allow the minority
of the present generation to do so,"
declared Professor J. W. Madden of the
Stanford Law School in a statement
made to a reporter yesterday.
According to Professor Madden, cur
rent ideas on social problems and prac
tices are not quickly recognized in a
law because it cannot act tentatively
or experimentally. It must be sure it
is right. Decrees must be supported by
the general community before the law
acts as such, and the judges, because
of their social heredity, are usually
conservative men, drawn from moneyed
and propertied backgrounds, which
may account for their deliberate pro
cedure.
However, the law may be altered
either through a change of ideas in the
social fabric, or through court decrces
which take account of newer thinking.
The education of judges is thus as
pertinent to change as is the education
of the people, and the two work mu
tually toward change.
The needed change, points out Pro
fessor Madden, will become more diffi
cult as time goes on, as laws are be
coming more volumijious and difficult.
Although the American Law Institute
is doing compilation and research cal
culated to make the laws more acces

sible, it cannot be expected that the
everyday man will be his own lawyer
any more than he is his own doctor.
