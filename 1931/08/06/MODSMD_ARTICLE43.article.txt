# PLAN NEGRO MUSIC FOR RECITAL TODAY
## 
### 
Dvorak's Symphony in E Minor,
"From the New World," will be played
this afternoon as a feature of the organ
recital by Warren D. Allen, University
organist. Two movements will be
played, Adagio-Allegro molto, and the
Largo.
Although this celebrated Symphony
is strongly influenced by the songs of
(he American Negro, especially in the
famous Largo, only one actual iolk
melody is used, "Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot," appearing in the second
theme in the first movement.
The program, which is made up of
American folk music, will also include
"Song of the Basket-Weaver," from
"St. Lawrence Sketches" by Alexander
Russell, director of music at Princeton
University. An anonymous Negro spir
itual, "Deep River," and another by
Call Diton, "Keep Me From Sinking
Down," will be on the program, as will
Seth Bingham's Puritan Procession
from "Pioneer America." This is the
finale of the second suite for organ, by
Professor Bingham of Columbia, and
features "York Tune," a severe old
New England psalm melody.
On Sunday evening at 7:30, there will
be a sacred concert by the University
choir, instead of the regular organ re
cital.
