Professor Harold Benjamin, guest of
honor, gave a talk on "Secondary Edu

on a Utopian prediction or assumption
that political and economic difficulties
in education will be solved, and edu
cation will be centered around the three
activities, communication, creation and
control.
Lilly Nordgren, a member of Pi
Lambda Theta, rendered a group of
songs.
