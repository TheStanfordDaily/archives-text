College is a very interesting little in
stitution. It has only 350 women stu

spirit. The college is a very old one,
having been founded in 1842 by Charles

very radical idea at that time.
''The same family has been in con
trol all these years and today Mr.

beautiful little school and in very
lovely surroundings. However, I don't
believe there is any place quite like
