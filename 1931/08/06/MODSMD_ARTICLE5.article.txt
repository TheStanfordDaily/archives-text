Another chapter in the history of
the new women's pool was enacted
last night when a number of noc
turnal bathers were frightened away
by quick action of campus police.
According to the officers' report,
three machine loads of women, be
lieved to be townspeople, arrived at
the pool shortly before midnight,
and, already garbed in bathing suits,
were ready to break the placid wa
ters of the pool when floodlights
operated by campus police lighted
the scene and halted the party. In
a roar of engines and a cloud of
dust the would-be bathers dashed
away.
