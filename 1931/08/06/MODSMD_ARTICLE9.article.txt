# Amalgamation Impossible Between White and Black Races, Says H. D. Meyers
## 
### 
The Negro as an individual has made remarkable and praiseworthy prog
ress. The Negro as a group is making strides toward assimilation of American
ideals and standards, hut the time will never come when amalgamation of while
and black races will be possible.
These are the beliefs of Professor Ilarold I). Meyers of the University of
North Carolina, who spoke to the Men's Education Club yesterday on "The
Negro and the South." It had been announced that the speaker would talk on
extra-curricular activities in the high school, a subject on which he is a national
authority, but it was decided later to change the subject.
Meyers began his talk by pointing out that six and a half million of the ten

Negroes in the United Stales
i live in the South, and that they form
| a "black belt," which he explained are
j districts or counties where there were
| more Negroes than white people. He
i said further that the predominance of
I Negroes is the reason that they are
made to ride in "jim crow" cars and
| live in "jim crow" districts.
Referring good-naturedly to the fact
that the Negroes are not allowed to
i vote in certain districts in the South,
| he said that the explanation is simply,
j "they don't."
Miscegenation a Big Problem
Meyers pointed out that the mulatto
| and the accompanying miscegenation
[form a distinct problem in the South.
He placed the blame on the white man,
| saying that "Since there can be no
; mulattos without their having some
; white blood in them, the mulatto is
really a "white" problem. Until the
i white man develops a higher and finer
i type of morality, the problem of misce
! genation will continue."
"The mulattoes are class or color
i conscious, in many cases, and looked
upon by the 'black' Negro with dis
dain." He explained that the university
town of Chaple Hill was a "brown"
town.
"Poor housing conditions account for
many of the moral problems of the
Negro," Meyers declared, explaining
that it is not unusual to find n 'nun
and wife, three children, and two
boarders all living in two rooms. The
resulting strain on moral standards
would be difficult for even a highly
cultured individual to withstand, he
averred.
Fewer Negroes Are Lynched
Meyer coneluded by saying that
lynching in the South is decreasing
steadily. It was pointed out that undue
publicity given lynching cases, with
the accompanying arousal of emotion
does more harm than good, and that a
better method of handling such cases
Aaq:i jojjb }aB.ioj oj aq pjnoM
occur and not try to pry into the con
tributory causes. The solution he sug
gested is education, a gradual spread
of feeling against lynching in various
communities.
Musical entertainment was provided
by J. E. Kaler, who sang a solo, ac
companied by R. A. Hendricks. W. L.
Iverson was chairman of the meeting.

The Negro as an individual has made remarkable and praiseworthy prog

ideals and standards, hut the time will never come when amalgamation of while
and black races will be possible.
These are the beliefs of Professor Ilarold I). Meyers of the University of
North Carolina, who spoke to the Men's Education Club yesterday on "The
Negro and the South." It had been announced that the speaker would talk on
extra-curricular activities in the high school, a subject on which he is a national
authority, but it was decided later to change the subject.

that the Negroes are not allowed to

Miscegenation a Big Problem

"Poor housing conditions account for
many of the moral problems of the
Negro," Meyers declared, explaining
that it is not unusual to find n 'nun

would be difficult for even a highly
cultured individual to withstand, he
averred.
