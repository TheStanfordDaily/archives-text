# COLORFUL MUSIC CLOSES SOUR CONCERT SEASON
## "New World" Symphony Is Feature of Smallens' Second Program Increase in Attendance for Present Season Noted Say Directors 
### 
Tuneful, colorful music—music I hat j
pleased the unusually large audience j
which heard it—marked the final pro
gram of the series of symphony orches
tra concerts which have been presented
this summer in the Woodland Theater j
at Hillsborough by the Philharmonic
Society of San Mateo County .
Alexander Smallens, conducting his
second concert at the Theater, seemed
more at ease with the program Sunday,
than in his first appearance. His di
recting Sunday was done with freedom*
and enthusiasm, and he was loudly ap- .
plauded at the conclusion of the con- j
cert.
Fifth Symphony Pleases
Dvorak's Fifth Symphony, the fa- j
miliar "From the New World," was i
listened to with the most interest, per- j
haps, by the audience Sunday. Written
while the composer was director of the !
National Conservatory in New York
City, the composition makes use of fa- j
miliar American themes. Although
Dvorak denies having used any spe
cific folk or native airs in the sym- j
phony, the listener could detect in the
piece melodies similar to typically j
American Negro spirituals. The thuxi
and fourth movements show some evi
dences of Indian themes.
Best known of all of the themes in
ihe symphony is the famous Largo. In
troduced by the English horn, it is
taken up by the various sections of j
the orchestra and the plaintive, hdunt- |
ing melody given a meaning that is un
forgotttable.
Brahms' Overture Played
The "Academic Festival" Overture by
Johannes Brahms, which opened the i
program, was written in memory of
his being granted a Doctor of Philoso
phy degree by the University of Bres- I
lau. Woven into the overture are a j
number of German student songs. It j
is a rousing almost boisterous compo- !
sition and was played with gusto.
Opening the second half of the pro- !
gram was Weingartner's arrangement
of von Weber's "Invitation to the
Dance." This brilliant little composi- j
tion, written originally as a piano pro
gram piece, is divided into three pa-ts:
an opening section in "moderato," the
invitation to the dance; a middle sec
tion in "allegro vivace," the dance; and
a coda in slower tempo, depicting the I
lady being gracefully escorted back to j
her seat at the close of the dance.
A short but extremely emotional se- j
lection from Wagner, the "Good Fri
day Spell" music from "Parsifal" re- J
vealed strange harmonies and highly !
spiritual meanings. The title refers to |
a scene in the opera where the hero is J
told that the loveliness of nature on j
Good Friday is an expression of the j
world's gratitude to the Redeemer.
"Finlandia" Concludes Program
Concluding the program, and coming !
almost as a climax to the program of I
melodic and emotional numbers, was I
the symphonic poem, "Finlandia" by j
Jean Sibelius. Like Dvorak did in the ,
New World Symphony, Sibelius has
woven into this composition themes '
I hat are characteristic of his native j
land.
It has been said that the Poem re- !
cords the impressions of an exile's re- j
turn home after a long absence. The j
strangely somber music of the begin- |
ning seems to describe the people's' I
struggle under the stress of national j
sorrow. Later it changes to cheerful
.ind finally peaceful themes, prophetic '
of the final success of the people.
Sunday's concert was the eighth of |
the present summer "season; Smallens (
was the fifth guest conductor. Accord- j
ing to Ihe Board of Directors, thore has '
been an appreciable increase in (he at- j
tendance at this season's concerts.

number of German student songs. It j
is a rousing almost boisterous compo- !
sition and was played with gusto.
Opening the second half of the pro- !
gram was Weingartner's arrangement
of von Weber's "Invitation to the
Dance." This brilliant little composi- j
tion, written originally as a piano pro
gram piece, is divided into three pa-ts:
an opening section in "moderato," the
invitation to the dance; a middle sec
tion in "allegro vivace," the dance; and
a coda in slower tempo, depicting the I
lady being gracefully escorted back to j
her seat at the close of the dance.
A short but extremely emotional se- j
lection from Wagner, the "Good Fri
day Spell" music from "Parsifal" re- J
vealed strange harmonies and highly !
spiritual meanings. The title refers to |
a scene in the opera where the hero is J
told that the loveliness of nature on j
Good Friday is an expression of the j
world's gratitude to the Redeemer.
"Finlandia" Concludes Program
Concluding the program, and coming !
almost as a climax to the program of I
melodic and emotional numbers, was I
the symphonic poem, "Finlandia" by j
Jean Sibelius. Like Dvorak did in the ,
New World Symphony, Sibelius has
woven into this composition themes '
I hat are characteristic of his native j
land.
It has been said that the Poem re- !
cords the impressions of an exile's re- j
turn home after a long absence. The j
strangely somber music of the begin- |
ning seems to describe the people's' I
struggle under the stress of national j
sorrow. Later it changes to cheerful
.ind finally peaceful themes, prophetic '
of the final success of the people.
Sunday's concert was the eighth of |
the present summer "season; Smallens (
was the fifth guest conductor. Accord- j
ing to Ihe Board of Directors, thore has '
been an appreciable increase in (he at- j
tendance at this season's concerts.
Tuneful, colorful music—music I hat j
pleased the unusually large audience j
which heard it—marked the final pro
gram of the series of symphony orches
tra concerts which have been presented
this summer in the Woodland Theater j
at Hillsborough by the Philharmonic
Society of San Mateo County .
Alexander Smallens, conducting his
second concert at the Theater, seemed
more at ease with the program Sunday,
than in his first appearance. His di
recting Sunday was done with freedom*
and enthusiasm, and he was loudly ap- .
plauded at the conclusion of the con- j
cert.
Fifth Symphony Pleases
Dvorak's Fifth Symphony, the fa- j
miliar "From the New World," was i
listened to with the most interest, per- j
haps, by the audience Sunday. Written
while the composer was director of the !
National Conservatory in New York
City, the composition makes use of fa- j
miliar American themes. Although
Dvorak denies having used any spe
cific folk or native airs in the sym- j
phony, the listener could detect in the
piece melodies similar to typically j
American Negro spirituals. The thuxi
and fourth movements show some evi
dences of Indian themes.
Best known of all of the themes in
ihe symphony is the famous Largo. In
troduced by the English horn, it is
taken up by the various sections of j
the orchestra and the plaintive, hdunt- |
ing melody given a meaning that is un
forgotttable.
Brahms' Overture Played
The "Academic Festival" Overture by
Johannes Brahms, which opened the i
program, was written in memory of
his being granted a Doctor of Philoso
phy degree by the University of Bres- I
lau. Woven into the overture are a j
number of German student songs. It j
is a rousing almost boisterous compo- !
sition and was played with gusto.
