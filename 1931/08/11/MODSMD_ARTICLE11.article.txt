# HOOPS CONTRASTS EDUCATION IN U.S. AND IN GERMANY
## Compares Both Systems and Says German Methods More Beneficial 
### 
"Germany's more generalized educa
tion is of greater benefit to the student
than is America's system of specializa
tion," declared Reinald Hoops, acting
assistant professor of German, in his
lecture "Education in Germany" given
last night at the Little Theatre.

The educational system in Germany
is much the same as in America, in that
school divisions are similar, school at
tendance is compulsory up to a certain
age, and schools are all public insti
tutions, Professor Hoops went on to
say.
German Schools More Advanced
While these divisions are similar,
however, the German divisions ate a
shade more advanced than ours, ac
cording to Hoops. As a result, the Ger
man who quits full-time school at the
age of 14 will have nearly as complete
an education as the American at 18.
The four-year elementary school
leaches fundamental knowledge. At the
age of 10 a German child advances to
the "higher" school which he must at
tend full-time until he becomes 14,
and then part-time, at least, until 18.
This higher school offers a broad field
of knowledge, a varied assortment of
subjects, that will lead the student to
a greater appreciation of life.
No Exes in Foreign System
Absence of examinations marks the
German teaching system. Examinations
are required only for advancement
from one school to another. This meth
od, Hoops believes, broadens the indi
vidual's study, and does not limit him
to the accumulation of certain facts
upon which he expects to be examined
as does the American practice of regu
lar examinations.
The present day teacher is entirely
unlike that type exemplified by Emil
Jannings in "Blue Angel." A modern
instructor is a sort of older comrade
who gives advice and to
his pupil. No student is forced to work,
Hoops said.
Germany's university is a five-year
institution, where, for the first time,
the student is subjected to specializa
tion. The old system of attending more
than one university is used today, a
system that is more beneficial than
spending the entire time in one place,
as we do in America, he concluded.
