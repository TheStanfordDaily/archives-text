# DEAN YOST RETURNS FROM MOUNTAIN TRIP
## 
### 
Dean Mary Yost returned to Stanford
Friday evening from Tuolumne Mead
ows, where she has been spending a
vacation with the Sierra Club.
Her vacation was divided into two
two-week excursions. The first took
the party down the Tuolumne River
through Muire Gorge to Pate Valley
and Benson Lake, one of the sources
of Heteh Hetchy. From the lake the
party returned to Tuolumne Meadows
where it again set out for a two weeks'
trip, this time to Mt. Ritter and Mt.
Banner.
