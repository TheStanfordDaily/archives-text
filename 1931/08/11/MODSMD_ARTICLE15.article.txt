## 
### 
The autogiro which recently dis
played its ability to land on the
White House lawn and take off
is now being repaired at the Palo
Alto School of Aviation, according
to Field Manager Leslie B. McMurty.
This is the first time in the history
of aviation that any major repair
work has been done on an autogiro
outside of a factory. The ship was
damaged a few weeks ago at the
San Francisco Bay Airport when it
accidentally landed on some parked
automobiles, injuring several spec
tators.
Inside of two weeks, states Mc-
Murty, the ship will be repaired and
ready for a lest (light. It is capable
of a complete stall at any altitude
and can descend vertically at the
rate of 15 feet per second.
It can attain a forward speed of
120 miles per hour.
The autogiro is owned by Charles
Haines of Spokane. It is the first to
have visited the Palo Alto Airport
and the second ever seen in this
part of the country.
