# GREGOIRE TO GIVE ENGLISH LECTURE
## Byzantine Epic Is Subject of Talk Tomorrow 
### 
Lecturing in English, Professor Henri
Gregoire will speak tomorrow after
noon on "The Byzantine Epic," the lec
ture being supplemented by recitations
by Miss Mary Anita Loos and Frank A.
Delamarter of English verses which
they have written from translations of
Greek. This lecture, which is one of
Professor Gregoire's series on Byzan
tine culture and civilization, will be
given in the Little Theatre at 4:15, and
is the only English lecture in the se
ries, the others being in French.

The lecture will be based upon the j
investigations Professor Gregoire has j
made in the field of Byzantine epic j
songs. His findings will be published i
in his forthcoming edition of "Digenis
Akritas," named for the Greek "chan- j
son de geste" written by an anonymous
tenth century poet, whose poem and |
songs are, according to Professor Greg- 1
cire, unknown to the English reading |
public. The book will include the re- !
suits of his investigations on this hith- j
erto neglected subject, and will be ac
companied by a metrical translation of j
the poem—the actual "Byzantine epic" j
—prepared by Frank A. Delamarter, j
who will present a recitation of his 1
work tomorrow. Selections of the minor J
songs, done in English verse and re
taining the meter of the original Greek,
have been written by Mary Anita Loos
for this volume. Miss Loos will recite
some of her work at tomorrow's lec
ture.
Professor Gregoire says that the
Byzantine epic songs have been pre
served to the present day by oral tra
dition, and shows that in the rase of
"The Son of Andronikos," translated by
Miss Loos, a reference to Nfkephoros
proves that the song dates back to the
end of Ihe tenth century. The meter
of the Byzantine song is the versus
politicus, of 15 syllables, and is as com
mon in mediaeval Greek as it is rare
ir English poetry.
"Besides the rhythm," according to
Professor Gregoire, "the main inter
est. of (his 'abridged' epic lies in the
style, concise to the utmost, and curi
ously 'allusive.' A mass of vivid pic- j
lures of Byzantine mediaeval life is \
condensed in a few lines or suggested j
in a few words."
