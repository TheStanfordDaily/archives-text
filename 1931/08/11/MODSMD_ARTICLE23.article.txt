# PRAISE AND REUBKE, DESERVED AND UNDESERVED

### 
In a neighboring column appear today Idlers praising and
rebuking the Daily lor ils wavs. To take up Ihe rebuke lirsl: the
Campus Opinion contributors hold that the Daily ought to he
ashamed of itself for printing that a visiting professor, now
departed from Ihe campus, gave an interview "yesterday."
Guilty, and the Daily is properly ashamed. Hut Ihe error is not,
may it be mildly suggested, quite so heinous as the letter writers
seem to regard it. The reporter who wrote the story was cor
rect when he said "yesterday," but the "make-up man," Ihe
member oi' the stall' who puts Ihe paper together, didn't get it
into that issue, thinking that the matter was of such general and
permanent interest that il might properly he postponed in order
to permit the immediate printing of more timely items thai had
to be printed that day or not at all. And so the train was set
that finally resulted in the story's being printed, with the "yes
terday" still there. Of course the Daily regrets the absurdity
that il fell into, but in its conscience it feels only silly, not
wick ed.
Next for the appreciated word of praise. The commendation
is valued all the more highly because il isn't tlie easiest thing in
the world to get out an interesting, all-round newspaper in the
summer, when so many sources of news, available in other quar
ters, are dried up.
The writer of this communication refers to comments bv
"The Prowler" in Saturday's Palo Alio limes, which probably
inspired his own letter. II may be worth while to quote what Ihe
Prowler said:
Stanford's summer quarter is different from its fall, winter
and spring terms. The colorful, cotiegiate life with its speeding
cut-down cars, its athletics and social festivities expires annually
with commencement, not to return until October, the summer
intermission being occupied chiefly with drab study. Gone in
summer are the rah-rah boys and the co-ed flappers. In their
stead are the school teachers here to "brush up," or to prepare
in 10 weeks to teach a subject heretofore brand new to them, or
to do another summer stretch toward that distant Ph.l). Dirty
"cords" and faded sweaters are replaced by sedate business suits
worn by school administrators taking summer work. And the
youth that does remain here for the summer quarter does so pri
marily to work—not play.
Nowhere is the difference between the collegiate normalcy of
the three "regular" quarters and the "summer school" character
of the extra quarter more visible than in the issues of the stu
dent newspaper (Stanford Daily, alias "Dippy") of those con
trasting quarters. In summer quarter faithful accounts of
learned lectures, interviews with visiting professors, and other
types of high-brow copy occupy the columns that are devoted at
other seasons to football practice, inter-class competitions, fra
ternit\ rushing news and student pranks. The editorials in sum
mer "lay off" the faculty, the trustees, the administration, t'n
tikc the college journalism of fall, winter and spring quarters,
the policy of the summer issues appears to be animated by some
other idea than that the first and highest function of a college
editor is to do his best either to get himself almost kicked out
of school, or to create the impression of having nearly achieved
that heroic feat.

Hell, Iht' Daily is gratified by 111 o approbation which its cor
respondent expresses and which maybe can be inferred from
the Prowler's comments, but doesn't want to assume more virtue
than rightly belongs to it. Its content is, at least in part, dictated
bv circumstances its readers' tastes and interests and the
events on the campus which supply news. The Daily does
think that in the summer a larger proportion of students are
interested in lectures and interviews than in other quarters not
Theatre, but still to some degree interested in getting fhe gist of
interested enough, to be sure, to cause congestion in the Little
the ideas put forth. And as for athletics and such, the summer
Daily doesn't print much about those things for the same reason
that the Palo Alio Times is not now running the long football
stories that it will present beginning September 15 you can't
report what isn't going on.
And to the Prowler's inference that in other quarters Daily
editors are all intent on attacking the faculty or the adminis
tration or some representative of the ruling powers, may the
summer Daily—although it is none of its special business
enter a little protest? Some individual editors now and then are
seized with an obsession of attack, and promptly receive wide
and somewhat exaggerated publicity for it, but by and large
and as a class, the Daily's editors are not chronic victims of
that itch.
