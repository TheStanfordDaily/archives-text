# "MANANA" SPIRIT HAS TO GO NOW
## 
### 
Centuries ago men worshipped gods of the season, and then
age hy age passed and these gods were forgotten or relegated
to the realm of myths. But to many of us there is yet a god of
the summer who rules us, his insouciant vassals, with a stern
hand. He is the god of procrastination, a wily old duck who
entices his followers with the vague promise of "You can do it
tomorrow just as well."
But even his most subservient worshippers must realize that
11is region of necessity ends 111 is week. Sixteen days, two week
ends, and then finals. The fact that some, the educational group,
are in the throes of filial examinations this week conies as a
shocking awakening to those of us who have drifted easily
along with the casual summer days, little heeding the omni
present shadow of the library. Feverish gathering of term
paper material, post-haste attempts to rectify those long irre
sponsible afternoons at the swimming pool or on the golf course
must confront us. And why must it be tlml what we have read
this summer has nothing to do with our courses?

And to those of us, granted that there are a few, who some
how have remained impervious to the "mamma" spirit of the I
drowsy summer weather, to those hardv souls all honor be paid,
for they may now sit back and smugly await finals, happy in the
knowledge of work well done. And may thev never know what
they have missed.
