The Editor: Sir,
In your issue of August 6th appeared
an interview with Professor J. W. Mad
den, purporting to be from a "state
ment made to a reporter yesterday."
Professor Madden was a visiting pro
fessor from the University of Pitts
burgh, and was here only for the first
half of the summer quarter; the ex
amination in his course was on Thurs
day, July 23, and as everyone in the
Law School knows, he left for the East
a day or two later. Presumably the in
terview in question must have been
obtained at some time before that.
It seems hardly fair to a visiting pro
fessor, and certainly cannot give him a
very good impression of Stanford, to
seek an interview —and we are sure the
publicity was none of Professor Mad
den's own seeking—and then delay
publication until what turns out to be
two weeks after his departure. The use
of the word "yesterday," whether by
carelessness or design, only adds insult
to injury, and the only redeeming fea
ture of the whole matter is that Pro
fessor Madden, himself, probably will
not see the article at all. In order to
rectify the error in the eyes of his many
friends on the campus it is to be hoped
that you will be able to publish this
communication or some other appro
priate correction.
Yours very truly,
PAUL S. DAVIS,
RALPH M. BROWN.
The Editor: Sir,
As a regular Stanford student with
the greatest part of my college life
behind me 1 think that 1 am well quali
fied to speak upon the excellent quality
of work appearing in the summer
Daily. It is too bad that the members
ol the regular staff cannot receive
copies of the summer Daily so that
Ihey might learn the difference between
an ordinary college paper and a worth
while, well written paper.
An article in the Prowler column of
the Palo Alto Times by Dallas E. Wood
points out that gone are the rah-rah
boys and girls and that summer quar
ter students are in college for work
and not play. This attitude is reflected
in the paper, according to the colniunist.
Wood is especially jubilant over the
fact that the summer Daily prints high
brow news instead of the regular col
lege news.
I agree with Mr. Wood in this. Sum
mer quarter students should be thank
ful that they are not afflicted with the
"Dippy" as it is during the three regu
lar quarters of the year.
Yours truly,
