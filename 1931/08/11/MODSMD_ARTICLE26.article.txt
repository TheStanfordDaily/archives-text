From Day to Day. By Ferdynand
Goetel. Translated from the Polish
by Winifred Cooper. 1931. The Vik
ing Press, New York City. (At* the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
By alternating the daily entries into
his diary with the passages written
"from day to day" of a novel dealing
with his past experiences as a Polish
prisoner of war in Turkestan, Ferdy
nand Goetel has produced a fascinating
and skillful book.
Had the story of his past experiences
in Turkestan and his present ones in
Poland after the war been related
chronologically, the book would have
been lifeless, and commonplace and al
together pointelss. But for the two to
appear side by side, with the events of
the past coloring vividly his present
thoughts and writings, and gradually
creeping up on them until the noyel
fades out and the diai'y alone is left
to finish the tale, is a device hitherto
unused, and most clever.

To see the man's past and present,
and his parallel written records of
them, is to kn6w the man, to under
stand the love he had for the Russian
girl of the steppes, his growing es
trangement from his wife, and his at
tachment to his small daughter.
"From Day to Day," selected by the
Literary Guild of America is the first
of.Goetel's books to be translated into
English.
