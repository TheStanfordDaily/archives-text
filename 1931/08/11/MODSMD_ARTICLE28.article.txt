# SHOULD NOT NEGLECT STUDY OF GERMAN IN SCHOOLS SEARS SAYS
## Believes War Prejudice And Inertia Responsible For Disregard 
### 
"To neglect the scientific develop
ment of the German people would be
nothing short of stupid," stated Dr.
Jesse B. Sears, professor of education,
in a recent interview. Dr. Sears was
asked what might be the reason for
the comparatively slight amount of
German taught and studied in Ameri
can high schools, in (he face of the
science requirement in the universities
for a knowledge of the language.
"German is studied for two reasons,"
said Dr. Sears, in reply. "First, strictly
as a tool by means of which we may
gain, access to a wealth of knowledge in
that language. However, it must be
remembered that large numbers of stu
dents who enter high school have no
intention of going beyond, and have
no need of the German language as a
tool.
"Second, German is studied for cul
tural reasons, the hope being to add
to our store of knowledge of civiliza
tion outside of our own country.
"Both of these reasons are sound,"
Dr. Sears went on. "Why more stu
dents do not take German is probably
in part due to a hangover prejudice
from war times, and part to the gen
eral inertia of school people in nol re
establishing a course discontinued dur
ing the war. As to whether German
will be established in the high school
curriculum, there is no possible doubt.
Every intelligent person knows it
should be."

When questioned about the present
popularity of the French and Spanish
languages in high schools, Dr. Sears
replied:

"Why Spanish and French are more
popular in the West is due in part to
the popularity gained by French dur
ing war days, and partly to commer
cial and industrial developments in the
West, with their contacts with South
America, where Spanish is spoken."
