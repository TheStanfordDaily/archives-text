# PSYCH STUDENT IS SUBJECT OF WHITE RAT'S EXPERIMENT
## 
### 
Many a white rat has been the
subject of experiments by curious
psychologists, but William P. Wre
den, who is taking a course in psy
chology this summer, can claim to
be one of the few who have been
experimented on by a white rat.
Wreden's bit of trial and error
learning was gleaned yesterday
when be was visiting Albert Walton,
of the psychology department, in the
latter's office. Wredcn saw a cage
of white rats on the table and,
thinking that it would be fun to
put the rats through their paces,
stuck his finger in the cage to stir
them up. There was a yelp, and two
large needle-like holes were to be
seen in (he tip of his little linger.
"The funny part of the whole epi
sode," said Wreden, "was that the
rats had just been fed."
