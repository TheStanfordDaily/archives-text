# EDUCATION IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY CHINESE STUDENT, SAYS VOTAW
## Only Ten Per Cent of Population In China Is Literate 
### 
That teaching in China is far more
interesting work than in the United
States, is the belief of Professor Mau
rice Votaw, instructor in St. John's
University, Shanghai, China, who was
visiting friends on the campus yester
day. "The Chinese students go to the
university to learn and they let no
outside influences interfere with the
pursuit of their work," he said. "No
disciplinary measures are ever neces
sary."
Professor Votaw has been an in
structor in journalism in St. John's
University for the past nine years. He
will sail tomorrow to resume his du
ties having completed a six-month
leave of absence, the principal part of
which has been spent in this country.
No Distracting Factors
"The schools are all boarding insti
tutions in China and a student is not
allowed to leave the campus without
special permission," Votaw said. "There
are no automobiles to speak of and the
Chinese students direct all of their en
ergy toward securing an education.
"In China only 10 per cent of the
people can read and write and as there
are no public schools, those fortunate
enough to attend a university make
the most of their opportunity. There
is not the serious attitude in universi
ties in this country that is found in
lhat of the Chinese."

The journalistic work of the Chinese
students is modeled after that of the
American system, says Professor Vo
taw, weekly and bi-weekly publica
tions are issued as in this country, with
an annual at the end of the year. The
method used by St. Johns is to print
a weekly paper in English and a bi
weekly issue in Chinese. This is due
to the fact that the course is given in
English, stated Votaw.
Lacks Medical Knowledge
There are only two schools in China
that carry a regular Journalism course
in their curriculum, the one at Shang
hai and another at Peking.
"I think that if foreign nations are
really desirous of helping China, they
might take a greater interest in the
physical well being of the people and
perhaps less in the political conditions,''
Votaw declared. "The lack of medical
knowledge has always been the pri
mary drawback to China's advance and
until suitable sanitary methods are
evolved, it will never take its place as
one of the leading world powers. How
ever, I believe that no foreign power
will ever lead China out of the twi
light; it must accomplish that alone."
