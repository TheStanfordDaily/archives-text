# DESCRIBES LIFE AT CAMBRIDGE U
## Speaker Says Athletics Hold Prominent Place 
### 
The average undergraduate at Cam
bridge University in England devotes
far more time to athletics than the av
erage American undergraduate, accord
ing to Robert Wormser, former grad
uate student, who has recently spent
two terms at that school. Wormser ad
dressed the class in Comparative Edu
cation Friday, on his experiences there.

It was pointed out by Wormser that
there is far more participation at both
Oxford and Cambridge on account of
the prevalence of Tntra-colfege athletic
activities. He explained that from one
third to one-half of the students take
part in a wide variety of sports, play
ing on one of the twenty playing fields,
and without any faculty supervision.
Professional coaches, he said, were rel
atively few.

Speaking of the social life among the
students, Wormser declared that as an
adjunct to the inevitable "afternoon
tea" there is a good deal of serious con
versation, much more than one finds
in universities in this country. He
found the Cambridge men to be very
hospitable and courteous, although they

are "not enthusiastic" about America
in general. He discovered that the un
dergraduates knew more about A1 Ca
pone and "Legs" Diamond than many
in this country do.

Strange to the American student are
the library regulations, he said. No un
dergraduate student is allowed to with
draw books from any of the libraries
and they are allowed in them only Ihe
last three hours of the time they are
open. The libraries close in the eve
nings.
Wormser devoted the rest of his lec
ture to explaining the differences he
noticed between universities in this
country and Cambridge and Oxford.
