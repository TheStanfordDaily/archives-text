# PRIDE OF STANFORD STABLES LIE BURIED IN MARKED GROUND NEAR GOLF COURSE
## 
### 
Just west of Roble Hall, next to the
golf course, is a plot of ground sacred
to horseflesh. Here lie the remains of
those champions which graced the
stable of Senator Stanford in the
eighties and nineties. On the same site
is a tablet erected by the University
which commemorates motion-picture
research done on the movements of the
horse, under the patronage of Stanford.
The Senator was a patron of many
arts, but his interest in horses led to
some notable experiments on horse
locomotion. This fact may serve to ex
plain why more world's champions
were bred at the Palo Alto farm than
at any other one stable.
Twenfy-four electro-cameras were
used in this research work. J. D. Isaacs
was engineer-technician, Eadweard J.
Muybridge acted as photographer, and
J. D. B. Stillman, M.D., analyzed the
photographs. This work, done in 1878-
79, foreshadowed the modern start-stop
method used in the analysis of sport
ing events.
A large bronze image of a thorough
bred horse stands near the tablet. This
monument, cast in Paris, replaces the
wooden headstones which"' formerly
marked each grave. It stands directly
over the resting-place of "Palo Aito,"
champion stallion in 1891. Around him
lie buried many other famous racers.
Among them are "Beautiful Bells,'" <he
first mare to produce three champion
yearlings. She was world's champion
brood mare and shared honors with
"Mayflower," first Stanford mare to

I foal a world's champion. "Mayflowei"
is also buried there.
I Two tracks kept these horses in
prime condition. There was a large
! track for time trials, and a smaller one
inside for exercising purposes. Both are
; pretty much overgrown and trodden
! downâ€”mute relics of former splendor.
Two large barns, both of which are
1 yet in excellent condition, housed the
I establishment. One quartered the
blooded stock and contained the repair
| shop and smithy. The other, a two
-1 storied wooden structure,, held supple
! mentary stalls, mows, rig-rooms, and
I sleeping quarters for the men.
Today one of the bai'ns has broken
! its ti'adition and serves as warehouse
( for the Stanford golf course, but the
| other houses the fancy show-stock of
' a local sportsman. Several men are
I about the place to keep the horses in
| trim. They use their own track, but the
; remainder of their surroundings hark
! back to the days of Senator Stanford's
i "Palo Alto," and "Electioneer," chain -
I pion sire of world's champions.
