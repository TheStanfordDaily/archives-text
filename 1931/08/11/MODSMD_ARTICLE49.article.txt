# STANFORD HAS STRONG SWIMMING PROSPECTS FOR OLYMPIC GAMES
## Austin Clapp, Former Captain, Is Leading Contender In 400, 500 Meters 
### 
That Stanford will be well repre
sented in the swimming competition
during the 1932 Olympic games at Los
Angeles, in the opinion of Coach Thorn
ton, assistant to Ernst Brandsten, ad
visory director of water sports. Be
sides having several outstanding per
formers in the racing events, there is
a strong possibility that Stanford will
defeat American competition in water
polo and thereby gain the right to be
the representative in this sport, accord
ing to Thornton.
"The leading prospect," he says, "is
Austin Clapp, captain of last year's
swimming team and captain-elect of
the 1932 water polo squad. He was a
member of the 1928 Olympic swimming
team, competing in the 400-meter and
500-meter free-style races and in the
relay. He is at present National Inter
collegiate 220-yard free-style and .500-
yard A.A.U. champion. I expect him
to be a candidate for the same events
next year and he should be successful
in making the United States team.
Wiget Star of Frosh Squad
"Then there is Ted Wiget, star of
last year's frosh squad, who is se
lected by many swimming authorities
as the greatest Stanford product since
Norman Ross, who broke ten world's
records in one day on October 20, 1919.
Wiget defeated Clapp in the recent
•AA.U. meet at Hawaii in the 400-meter
race and is the far-western champion
in the 100-meters. I expect him r.lso
to make a place on the Olympic swim
ming team."
Two other varsity members whom
Thornton thinks have a chance of rep
resenting this country in the Olympics
are Frank Booth and Tuppy Gardner.
Booth is national back-stroke cham
pion and captain of next year's varsity.
The Pacific Coast Intercollegiate 50 and
100-yard free-style records are held
by Gardner, but as nothing under 100
meters is held in the Olympics, Thorn
ton believes he will participate in that
event.
Many Water Polo Veterans
The water-polo team that wins the
National A.A.U. championship is se
lected to represent the United States
m that division of the aquatic program. :
Stanford won the national junior title i
last year, but did not compete for the
senior. Thornton believes that if Stan
ford does enter the senior competition
next year it has an even chance of
winning. The strongest competition, he
says, will come from the New York
A.C., Illinois A.C., Chicago A.A., and i
the Los Angeles A.C.

"The probable lineup for the water
polo team next year," said Thornton,"
will find all of last year's men back
with one exception. The veterans re
porting will be: Captain-elect Austin
Clapp, Booth, De Silva, forwards;
Woods and Harris, guards, and Mac-
Linton, goal keeper. Ted Wiget will
be a hard man to keep off the squad.

"If a disagreement happens to arise
over the selection of a water polo team
for the Olympics and it is decided to
have an all-star team, Clapp, Booth
and MacLinton are Stanford's host
prospects. Taking everything into con-

sideration, I believe Stanford's swim
prospects for the Stanford Olympiad
are excellent."

as the greatest Stanford product since
Norman Ross, who broke ten world's
records in one day on October 20, 1919.
Wiget defeated Clapp in the recent
•AA.U. meet at Hawaii in the 400-meter
race and is the far-western champion
in the 100-meters. I expect him r.lso
to make a place on the Olympic swim
ming team."
Two other varsity members whom
Thornton thinks have a chance of rep
resenting this country in the Olympics
are Frank Booth and Tuppy Gardner.
Booth is national back-stroke cham
pion and captain of next year's varsity.
The Pacific Coast Intercollegiate 50 and
100-yard free-style records are held
by Gardner, but as nothing under 100
meters is held in the Olympics, Thorn
ton believes he will participate in that
event.
Many Water Polo Veterans
The water-polo team that wins the
National A.A.U. championship is se
lected to represent the United States
m that division of the aquatic program. :
Stanford won the national junior title i
last year, but did not compete for the
senior. Thornton believes that if Stan
ford does enter the senior competition
next year it has an even chance of
winning. The strongest competition, he
says, will come from the New York
A.C., Illinois A.C., Chicago A.A., and i
the Los Angeles A.C.

"The probable lineup for the water
polo team next year," said Thornton,"
will find all of last year's men back
with one exception. The veterans re
porting will be: Captain-elect Austin
Clapp, Booth, De Silva, forwards;
Woods and Harris, guards, and Mac-
Linton, goal keeper. Ted Wiget will
be a hard man to keep off the squad.

"If a disagreement happens to arise
over the selection of a water polo team
for the Olympics and it is decided to
have an all-star team, Clapp, Booth
and MacLinton are Stanford's host
prospects. Taking everything into con-

sideration, I believe Stanford's swim
prospects for the Stanford Olympiad
are excellent."
That Stanford will be well repre
sented in the swimming competition
during the 1932 Olympic games at Los
Angeles, in the opinion of Coach Thorn
ton, assistant to Ernst Brandsten, ad
visory director of water sports. Be
sides having several outstanding per
formers in the racing events, there is
a strong possibility that Stanford will
defeat American competition in water
polo and thereby gain the right to be
the representative in this sport, accord
ing to Thornton.
"The leading prospect," he says, "is
Austin Clapp, captain of last year's
swimming team and captain-elect of
the 1932 water polo squad. He was a
member of the 1928 Olympic swimming
team, competing in the 400-meter and
500-meter free-style races and in the
relay. He is at present National Inter
collegiate 220-yard free-style and .500-
yard A.A.U. champion. I expect him
to be a candidate for the same events
next year and he should be successful
in making the United States team.
Wiget Star of Frosh Squad

lected by many swimming authorities
