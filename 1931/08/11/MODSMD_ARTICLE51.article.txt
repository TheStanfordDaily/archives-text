## 
### 
Trudging about the campus in a
I quiet and unobtrusive manner, but
alert to everything that goes on about
him, Alan McCaskill, familiarly known
as "Mac," has carried mail and docu
ments between the Administration
Building and the various departments
for fourteen years. He is the one man
who never forgets to mail letters.
Mac also guards the Memorial Church
! Sunday evenings with zealous devo
tion. He objects to the modern miss
wearing high heels in church, and with
a twinkle in his eye, said: "The girls
probably wish to announce the time of
their arrival."
When asked whether the students of
1 today were very different from those
of 1917, Mac replied in his Scotch
j brogue that they were far more civi
lized now. "The boys especially used
to be very rowdy and play all sorts of
childish pranks, but today only the
freshmen try to start things. Soon they,.

1 too, through their associations at Stan
ford, become civilized and are polished
like rocks washed by the ocean," he
declared.

Mac was born in Glasgow during the
1 pioneer days of '49 and as a youth he
was seized with wanderlust, came to
America, and finally to California,
which had boomed at the time of his
I birth.

I "Now, after having been a great
many places and seeing many things,
I live in the most palatial home on the
campus," continued Mac. He occupies
a little room in the Art Gallery.
Mac shook his head and said: "It is
almost unbelievable that during one
man's lifetime Stanford was founded
and became a great institution of
! higher learning. This alone would be
miraculous, but during my lifetime the
whole state of California has developed
from the wild and rough days of the
I Gold Rush."
