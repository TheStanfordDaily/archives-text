# ISLAND GOVERNMENT LACKING IN EDUCATION FUNDS, SAYS SPENCER

"The inability of the Philippine gov
ernment to appropriate sufficient funds
is the chief factor which prevents fur
therance of education in the Philip
pine Islands," said Peter L. Spencer,
acting associate professor of education,
when interviewed recently. In his po
sition as assistant commissioner of ed
ucation in the Philippines Professor
Spencer has come in close contact with
the educational problem there.
"This statement in no wise indicates
any laxity in the government, but
merely a financial situation which must
be accepted for the time, at least,'' he
declared.
"As a matter of fact, approximately
1,250,000 pesos have been expended by
the last two legislatures for primary
education. There are at present a mil
lion and a quarter students in .he pri
mary grades, constituting the great ma
jority attending government schools.
The number of children in primary
grades is 70 per cent of the number oi'
children who are of age for primary
education. However this does not mean
that all those in primary schools are
under age for the higher institutions.
One out of four eligible children at
tends intermediate school and the ratio
increases to one out of a possible eleven
attending high school."
Professor Spencer said that the
means are inadequate for accommodat
ing everyone who desires an education
in the Philippine Islands. There are
relatively few high schools. The Uni
versity of the Philippines is situated
in Manila, and there are two junior
colleges, one at Sigan and one at Cebu.
The educational system is much the
same as in the United States. School
books are adaptations of the books used
here and their courses of study cor
respond to ours.

In illustration of the advancement in
education in the Philippines, Professor
Spencer recalled the fact that about
thirty years ago a boat load of Ameri
can teachers landed at Manilla as pio
neers in their work. Today there are
27,000 teachers in the islands, 300 of
whom are Americans. Some still re
main who came in the original group.

As a result of the teachers' labors
illiteracy has been greatly reduced, and
common diseases such as cholera and
small pox are far less prevalent, Pro
fessor Spencer said.
