# Penn's Experiment Topic of Root's Lecture
## Professor Speaks Tonight In Little Theatre 
### 
"William Penn and the Holy Experi
ment" will be discussed tonight by Pro
fessor Winfred T. Root, of the Univer
sity of lowa, who is on the history fac
ulty here this summer. The lecture will
be given in the Little Theatre, and will
begin at 8 o'clock. The public is in
vited to attend.

Professor Root will endeavor to point
out that there is something in history
besides economic theory and politicsâ€”
that there is such a thing as ideals in
history. He will show that the efforts
of William Penn to found a colony with
political and religious idealism con
tributed to the ideals we hold in Amer
ican history. The Quakers were inter
ested in more than just political and
religious democracy, according to the
lowa professor, who will show that
they were also interested in social re
form.

William Penn, whose life extended
through the latter half of the seven
teenth century and the first 18 years of
the eighteenth, was interested in a
number of things, including a league
of nations, and colonial union. He was
an international character, his influ
ence being felt not only in America,
but throughout the western world.

Professor Root, himself a native of
Pennsylvania, received his A.B. degree
fiom Princeton in 1902 and his doctor's
de gree from the University of Pennsyl
vania in 1908. He is the author of "Re
lations of Pennsylvania with the Brit
ish Government, 1696-1765," and of a
good many papers on American his
tory, being especially concerned with
the history of Pennsylvania.
