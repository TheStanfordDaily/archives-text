# THREE ONE-ACT PLAYS SET FOR FRIDAY EVENING
## "The Vise," "Ana da Capo," "The Man in the Stalls" Will Be Given Logan, Custer, And Morgan Listed Directors of Student Dramas 
### 
Climaxing the dramatic season for
the summer quarter, a group of three
one-act plays will be given in the Little
Theater at 8:15 o'clock tomorrow eve
ning.
In "The Vise," a drama by Luigi Pi
randello, the same eternal triangle is
handled in true and original Pirandel
lian fashion. Henry Lee Logan is di
recting the play and playing the role
of Andrea Fabbri. June Brichard plays
Guilia, his wife; Joseph Sioss, Jr. is
Antonia Serra, a lawyer; and Laurette
Prindiville is a servant. The time is the
present, the costumes modern, and the
scene is laid in a room in the Fabbri
house, a small Italian country home.
Society Extravaganza
Possessing the same irony as her son
nets, Edna -St. Vincent Millay's "Aria
de Capo" is a beautiful fantasy on so
ciety, with a subtle thrust at war. Its
characters are Columbine and Pierrot,
played by Mary Purdy and Jack Pett
ker, Corydon and Thyrsis, shepherdess
and shepard, played by Irene Goldcn
berg and George Andreini, and Cothur
nus, which Ernest Mclnnes will inter
pret. Howard Custer will direct this
play, which proved very popular when
presented to the class in play produc
tion.
Another clever play involving the
triangle situation is Alfred Sutro's "The
Man in the Stalls," a modern comedy,
to be presented under the direction of
Lucile Morgan. Joseph Whitaker vvill
play Hector, the husband; Marian Lit
tlefield will be Betty, his wife, while
William Mahu will play Walter, their
friend. The scene of the play is laid
in Hector's home in London.
Sets Designed by Stover
Sets for the production are being de
signed and constructed by the class
in Theater workshop under the super
vision of Frederick Stover. Much at
tention is being paid to costumes and
make-up. The production is to be
given entirely by students of the classes
in dramatic production, under the su
pervision of Harold Helvenston.
