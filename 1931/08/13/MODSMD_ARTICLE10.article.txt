# PENN'S AMERICAN UTOPIA AHEAD OF TIME, SAYS ROOT
## Practical Value of Quaker Ideals Now Recognized, Is Claim of Root 
### 
"It would seem that the inflexible
idealist is as useful as the flexible ma
terialist who moves forward by com
promise." These were the closing
words of Winifred T. Root, acting pro
fessor of history from the University of
lowa, in his lecture last Tuesday eve
ning in the Little Theater on "William
Penn and the Holy Experiment."
Professor Root began his lecture by
explaining that history is far too com
plicated to be explained in terms of any
one factor. However, it is known that
ideals have had an outstanding part in
history. The democratic ideals of Lin
coln and Wilson attest to this.
Utopions Date From Plato
From the time of Plato, Professor
Root, remarked, man has been dream
ing of an Utopia. With the discovery
of America the place to establish this
Utopia was unfolded as only America
offered isolation from Europe and its
ideas. This experiment in Utopian
ideals was inevitable and it was to be
English-American in nature as England
was the only landholder who opened
her gates in the colonies to all.
The Quakers were established in the
seventeenth century by George Fox.
They were intensely loyal to Christian
principles and were, according to Pro
fessor Root, naive enough to think that
those principles could be put in opera
tion. With the fall of the liberal Crom
well reign in 1660 the Quakers began
to be persecuted and in the midst of
this struggle and strife was born the
future leader of the sect — William
Penn.
Quakers Established in America
Penn was born an aristocrat. But
as he grew up he displayed distinct hu
manitarian tendencies and in spite of
his father's efforts became a Quaker.
By this time the Quakers were so mal
treated that in 1682 Penn received a
grant of land in the new world that
they could have a home of their own.
Penn planned to establish a real de
mocracy—a home for the afflicted of
the human race; this plan was put into
operation and pilgrims came to Penn's
grant from all parts of the continent,
especially Ireland, Germany, and Swit
zerland.
In 1693 Penn proposed an interna
tional congress of the nations of the
world and in 1697 drafted a plan for an
American congress. His action was pre
mature although history bears out the
value and significance of Penn's pro
prosals.
For 70 years Penn and his fellow-
Quakers maintained their democratic
political structure with its unintentional
union of church and state, but it finally
broke down on the subject of war.
They believed that the Indian War, any
war, in fact, was wrong, but they did
not take active measures against those
who believed otherwise. This situa
tion ended in a rupture of their de
mocracy.
Professor Root pointed out that the
Quakers believed that man does not
live by bread alone but that they be
lieved that high moral ideals had a
place. Their democratic government
pointed this out although it was a
failure at that time. Among other
things that were too advanced for fime
that the Quakers introduced were cap
ital punishment for first degree mur
der only, and the abolishment of sla
very.
"The Quakers were idealists who had
the courage to put their ideals into
practice," the speaker said. They failed
"because they were too advanced lor
the age," but time has proven their
worth and has rescued them and put
them into use.
