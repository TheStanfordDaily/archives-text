# FIRE CHIEF DUGGAN RECALLS FOUR ALARM DAYS OF IRON-MEN DAYS
## 
### 
Fire Chief Duggan of the University
, fire department sat working at his roll
! top desk. Came a knock.
"Come in," said the chief, and for the
third time that day dropped his pencil
and surveyed the Daily reporter who
i stood in the doorway.
"Isn't there any way I can get rid
! of you?" queried Duggan.
j * "Sure," countered the cub. "Give me
a story."
\ "And what do you want?"
I "Something interesting about fires—
! anything you like. .
Nothing hut Smoke in Sight
The fire fighter leaned back in his
I creaky swivel chair and rubbed his
I chin.
"Well . . he mused, with an eye on
( the ceiling . . .
"It was in the old days, a four-alarm
I affair down near 4th and Townsend in
| the city—warehouse of the Simon Bed
Company. We came in on the third
alarm. Nothing but smoke in sight,
land all lines gone inside the building,
j Looked pretty bad. Firemen inside had
' not been heard from . . . Didn't have
masks in those days, you know, just
j wet sponges tied over the mouth . . .
| So we were ordered in to help em

out.
"Six howitzers went in with us. They
shoot a two-inch stream at 200 pounds
pressure and arc strong enough to take
| down doors and walls. Before turning
| them loose we looked for men. We got
! six who were overcome with smoke. I
I took out two, including the battalion
' chief, and helped with four others.
"Across the middle of the building
was a big fire-partition, and we pre
pared to take her out. Some hose lines
were still wound up in the place so
j we followed them down. Finally came
to where four firemen were crawling
around on their hands and knees, try
i ing to trace their way out by the lines,
i They were half unconscious and didn't
know tfiey were tracing the lines
! around in circles.
"Well, We Got Out," Says Duggan
"When we thought we had every
-1 body out, I noticed a line going up
through a door, so went in to sec about
it. Inside was a fireman, half dazed,
blinded and yet trying to run that hose
by himself. Well, we got out . .
At this point Duggan's big frame
! hunched forward in the swivel chair
as he announced, "that's till today—give
' you another some other time."'
