# WATER RESOURCES NEAR EXHAUSTION
## Survey Data Alarming; New Supplies Imperative 
### 
Stanford's water supply will be ex
hausted in the near future unless
measures are taken immediately to re
plenish the underground sources.
This conclusion was reached as a re
sult of a complete survey of Stanford's
water resources which began in March,"
1930, and has been in progress since
then.
Professor Cyrus F. Tolman of the ge
ology department and James W. Mc-
Donnell, assistant superintendent of
building and grounds, first brought the
matter of serious water shortage to the
attention of Comptroller Almon E.
Roth who arranged for the appropria
tion with which to carry on the sur
vey. The work has been conducted by
McDonnell, assisted by Cooper Hyde
and Cecil C. Killingsworth, both grad
uate students in geology.
Hope Report Suggests Remedy
McDonald is not on the campus at
present but Hyde was interviewed yes
terday and indicated that a report is
near completion which will furnish tin
information needed to effect a 'remedy
of the situation.
"For the past eight or nine years,"
Hyde said, "the subterranean water
supply has been steadily decreasing
until at present the resources are al
most depleted. More water his been
pumped from the four wells on the
campus than has percolated into the
underground source, with the alarm
ing results which now confront the Uni
versity."
It was explained that in order to re
charge the underground deposits into
which water percolates, callcd "gravel
streamers," artificial methods must be
used. And since the drainage basin of
San Francisquito Creek is the only re
source, it will be necessary to dam up
parts of the creek so that an appre
ciable amount of water will seep into
the gravel streamers.
Winter Rains Help Little
Heavy rainfall during the coming
winter would have little effect on ihe
undeground supply, since water would
flow into the bay unless dammed and
so given time to percolate into the
gravels.
Water level in the wells is dropping
from 10 to 15 feet annually, ihe sur
vey shows. It is economically impos
sible to drill below 300 feet and Stan
ford's wells are at depths ranging from
50 to 150 feet.
At present, owing to the recent dry
winters, the campus water supply is
being drawn from four wells. Sears
ville and Felt lakes are yielding ro
water, the small supply being held in
reserve against fire hazard.
"The situation has been neglected too
long," Hyde said. "In case that the
wells go dry, consequences will be se
rious." While the survey does not pre
dict this, it does stress an alarming
water shortage.

matter of serious water shortage to the

Hope Report Suggests Remedy
McDonald is not on the campus at
present but Hyde was interviewed yes
terday and indicated that a report is
near completion which will furnish tin
information needed to effect a 'remedy
of the situation.
"For the past eight or nine years,"
Hyde said, "the subterranean water
supply has been steadily decreasing
until at present the resources are al
most depleted. More water his been
pumped from the four wells on the
campus than has percolated into the
underground source, with the alarm
ing results which now confront the Uni
versity."
It was explained that in order to re
charge the underground deposits into
which water percolates, callcd "gravel
streamers," artificial methods must be
used. And since the drainage basin of
San Francisquito Creek is the only re
source, it will be necessary to dam up
parts of the creek so that an appre
ciable amount of water will seep into
the gravel streamers.
Winter Rains Help Little
Heavy rainfall during the coming
winter would have little effect on ihe
undeground supply, since water would
flow into the bay unless dammed and
so given time to percolate into the
gravels.
Water level in the wells is dropping
from 10 to 15 feet annually, ihe sur
vey shows. It is economically impos
sible to drill below 300 feet and Stan
ford's wells are at depths ranging from
50 to 150 feet.
At present, owing to the recent dry
winters, the campus water supply is
being drawn from four wells. Sears
ville and Felt lakes are yielding ro
water, the small supply being held in
reserve against fire hazard.
"The situation has been neglected too
long," Hyde said. "In case that the
wells go dry, consequences will be se
rious." While the survey does not pre
dict this, it does stress an alarming
water shortage.
