# JOURNALISM DIRECTOR LIKES SOCIAL SCIENCE EMPHASIS IN TEACHING
## 
### 
"Stanford is fortunate and on the
right track in having its journalism
work affiliated with the School of So
cial Sciences," remarked Professor
Gayle C. Walker, director of the school
of journalism of the University of Ne
braska, who was a campus visitor yes
terday.
''All our schools are bound to turn
more and more toward emphasizing
journalism as a social science or at
least dependent on the social sciences.
Some of the schools, as was the case
with Nebraska in its earlier years in
journalism teaching, affiliate journalism
with the English department, which
stresses too heavily only one side of
journalism. Some make the journalism
work a part of a school of business or
commerce, which seems to me a little
unfortunate in seeming to stress ihe
dollar mark."
The Nebraska school of journalism
now requires a good deal of study of
the social sciences for its journalism
certificate, and Professor Walker says
that he perceives a tendency in this
direction by most of the leading schools
of the country.
