# GOODBYE TEACHERS
## 
### 
Tomorrow will he the final (lav in this slimmer quarter for
many of those students enrolled in the School of Education.
Worn-out and "stale" or enthusiastic and inspired, they will
return to schools of high and low degree located.in practically
every section of the. United States.
Whatever their immediate physical and mental condition
may he, it is assumed that they will return to their work better
prepared than tliey were before they came here. Individuals
among them will feel, no doubt, that they haven't received their
money's worth, that this course was barren ot results, that that
professor talked much and said little. The majority, however,
must have gained something of genuine value.
No school satisfies all its students. The Stanford School of
Education has earned a wide and favorable reputation, not en
tirely unjustified, we hope. And yet there are some attending
here for the first time this summer, who, buoyed up by too high
hopes, will not have found what they expected and will leave
disappointed. That is,inevitable. On the other hand, the ma
jority will have gained immeasurably bv their contact with the
nationally prominent leaders in education who are included
in Stanford's faculty and with their fellow students, most ot
whom are leaders in their profession in their own communities.
One set of students who are especially likely to be dis
appointed are those who expect to carry away with them note
books full of methods and devices that will make their work
easier. True, such things are by-products, incidentals as it were,
of the work here, but they are not the most important by any
means. Methods and devices can be tound in books, bar more
fundamental and infinitely more important is the developing
of an attitude, an outlook on the whole field ot education that
one receives. With this foundation the student may work out
for himself the specific methods that will apply to liis particular
problem.
One often hears the question, "What did you get out of that
course?" The answer is sometimes difficult to give, naturally,
because what one "gets" is often something very intangible;
but it is none the less valuable.
So, school men and women, we hope that Stanford has
meant something to you, something that will remain with you.
We hope that you like us so well you will come back again.
Until then—goodbye and good luck.

in Stanford's faculty and with their fellow students, most ot
whom are leaders in their profession in their own communities.
One set of students who are especially likely to be dis
appointed are those who expect to carry away with them note
books full of methods and devices that will make their work
easier. True, such things are by-products, incidentals as it were,
of the work here, but they are not the most important by any
means. Methods and devices can be tound in books, bar more
fundamental and infinitely more important is the developing
of an attitude, an outlook on the whole field ot education that
one receives. With this foundation the student may work out
for himself the specific methods that will apply to liis particular
problem.
One often hears the question, "What did you get out of that
course?" The answer is sometimes difficult to give, naturally,
because what one "gets" is often something very intangible;
but it is none the less valuable.
So, school men and women, we hope that Stanford has
meant something to you, something that will remain with you.
We hope that you like us so well you will come back again.
Until then—goodbye and good luck.
