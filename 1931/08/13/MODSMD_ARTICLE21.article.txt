# WHY TALK ABOUT IT?

### 
Tuesday's Daily carried llie report of an address given on
the Campus recently, in which the speaker said that under
graduate students at Cambridge University in England engage
in conversation of the serious, intellectual sort to a greater ex
tent than similar students in American universities. His find
ings will probablv not be challenged by anyone, even by those
who have never had the opportunity to examine the English
student in his native lair.
We may just us well admit that conversation of the more
weighty kind is not one of our characteristics, either scholastic
or national. We have our "bull session, ol course, wherein
such imponderable subjects as sex, religion, and prohibition are
occasionally considered, but heated controversies over late po
litical issues, abstract social and economic problems and scien
tific speculations are not common among the rank and tile of
our undergraduates.
No doubt the reason lies somewhat in our national traditions
and background. As Ikis often been pointed out, we are a people
of action. As a nation, we have been a little suspicious of people
who spend much time in apparently fruitless conversation con
cerning problems or issues that might exist. Our method has
been to wait until a problem does exist and then to solve it as
well as we can.
Undergraduate students in American colleges probably re
flect that attitude. Idle conversation wherein no conclusions are
arrived al and no questions settled appeals to them not as a
pastime but as a waste of time. Thev prefer to wait until some
specific need arises and then, depending upon their native intel
ligence, do what ilceds to be done. Is that a proper attitude for
students?
