# TYPICAL OF SUMMER QUARTER SPORT
## 
### 
The annual summer swimming carnival that was held yes
terday afternoon in the Kncina pools proved to he the outstand
ing event of the quarter. Interest in aquatic sports during the
summer quarter has always been very weak and neglected, and
the swimming coaches are to he congratulated on the tine com
petitive spirit that they have succeeded in arousing.
The fast times and the excellent diving exhibitions that were
turned in are especially gratifying to the coaches, in that they
were established by men who have had little previous experi
ence in the tank.
In the summer quarter, the men are not training tor meet
marks or world records in any sport. The training that they get
at Stanford is to enable sound bodies to work in unison with
sound and thoroughly trained mind.

Palo Alto seems fairly unanimous in approving the ex
penditure of $1750 on the city's baseball park (which, by the
way, is on ground leased from Stanford) to secure the Detroit
baseball club for two weeks of spring practice, but not so
unanimous in the reasons for approving. National publicity,
improvement of accommodations for local ball players, profit
to the hotel which entertains the fifty paying guests?
