This week's "poem of the week," se- j
lected for publication by Miss Alice
Cooper from the contributions of the
members of her class in verse forms, is
the work of Isabel D. Rose.
PERHAPS
I often wonder about the years
That followed
Glorious Queen Helen's return to
Sparta,
She for whom brave men
Forsook the comforts of a glowing
hearth
And comradeship of wife and'son,
And set sail
Across the stormy seas
To avenge the woeful wrong
Done to Menalaus,
Their overlord.
Did Helen think of Paris when she sat I
again
To her husband's fireside?
Did the prattle of her children fade !
away
As she drifted down Ml. Ida with her j
love?
Did the glowing embers light for her
anew
The topless towers, which her bus- i
band's men o'er threw?
Did the morning thrushes' song awake I
in her the joy,
The echo of the lyric notes
That Paris sung to her
In Troy?
Did she weep when raindrops fell
At the apparition
Of the dear, dead spectre hidden in
the midst?
History tells us nothing
Of the years that intervened,
When Helen once again assumed
The duties of a wife and queen.
But when her glorious golden youth
had turned to silver age,
I like to think
That Paris came,
On wings of fleeting swiftness,
And, waking Helen with a kiss,
Bore her off again.
This poem concludes the series which |
has been published weekly during the j
summer quarter.
