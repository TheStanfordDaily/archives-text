POLITICSâ€”At The New Stanford.
Marie Dressier and her partner in
fun, Polly Moran, wise crack their way
through a couple of hours of genuine
comedy. The general situation h. .s Miss
Dressier, ex-washer-woman, running
for the office of mayor in a gangster-in
fested community on the platform,
"Help us save our children!" She has
the support of all the women in town
who boycott the opposing merchants
and strike on the reluctant husbands.
Polly is her own campaign manager.
Figure the rest out for yourself.
Ruth Etting entertains in a short
subject wilh a bit of singing, and shots
of wild life in Africa are good.
