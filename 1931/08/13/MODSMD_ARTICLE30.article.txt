# NEW NAVY TELESCOPE TO DEVELOP PLANET PHOTOGRAPHY IS PLAN
## Scientists Claim Instrument Will Increase Scope Of Astronomy 
### 
According to Sidney D. Townley,
professor of astronomy and geodesy,
the new 40-inch reflecting telescope
which iii being built by Professor G. W.
Ritehey and Professor Henri Chretien
of the University of Paris for the
United States Naval Observatory, will
be more efficient for photographic work
than much larger telescopes, because it
is being designed especially to catch
those rays that record on the photo
graphic plate. However, it will not have
the advantage of larger telescopes—
that of greater light gaining power.
Ritehey ancT Chretien claim that with
this new telescope it will be possible
to explore space to a distance of
1,500,u00,000 light years, and in addition
to do the exploring more accurately
than ever before.
Astronomers Chart Heavens
Astronomers chart the heavens by
matching together photographs of sec
tions of the sky, just as military map
makers chart enemy territory with a
series of airplane photographs. The
larger each section, the more accurately
the stars in it can be located, because
a large section shows more "funda
mental stars," whose location accurately
is known and which serve as land
marks from which to measure the lo
cation of other stars.
The telescope will photograph sky
sections, Ritehey believes, in which
the clear area, all of which can be ac
curately measured, in six times the
diameter of the clear area in pictures
that can be made with the largest
existing telescopes. This means 36 times
as much area of the sky can be meas
ured on one plate.
Accurate Charting Possible
As a result he expects his instru
ment will make possible far more ac
curate charting of the skies than here
tofore.
Improvements in the Ritchey-Chre
tien telescope will make it 90 per cent
efficient in photographic work as com
pared with its theoretical optical power,
whereas the most powerful telescope
now in use is only 5 per cent efficient
in this respect, Pxofessor Ritehey said.
