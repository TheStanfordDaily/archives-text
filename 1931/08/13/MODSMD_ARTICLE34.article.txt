## LEO C. DUNNELL GETS POST 
### 
Readings of verses by Mary Anita
Loos and Frank A. Delamarter were
a feature of the lectui*e on the "Byzan
j tine Epic" given yesterday by Profes
sor Henri Gregoire. This lecture was
1 given in English, although it was one
of the series on Byzantine culture and
civilization which he has been present
ing in French each Wednesday.
The verses, which Delamarter rid
! Miss Loos have composed from trans
lations of the Greek, are writts.i in
the original metre of 15 syllables to a
line—a metre which "some say :t is
impossible to carry in English verses,"
I according to Professor Gregoire.
The subject matter of the poetry
i concerns Digenis Akritas, the national
; hero of Byzantium, who was celebiated
by the verses of an anonymous poet of
the tenth century. It is the poetry of
this unknown man which Professor
Gregoire has investigated, and which
his two students have written as Eng
lish poetry from the translation.
The unceasing warfare between the
! Byzantine empire and the Arab chief
j tains, or Emirs, of Syria and Mesopo-
I tamia produced, the lecturer said, num
| erous epic songs, celebrating Greek he
i roes; several of these songs were used
by the author of the Digenis Akrilas
poems.
Professor Gregoire's work in the field
of the Byzantine epic is investigation
! in practically virgin territory, since the
! subject is little known to the English
speaking and reading public. There has
been hardly a paper on the subject of
the Byzantine epic, Professor Gregoire
stated.

Leo C. Dunnell, a Stanford law
graduate, has been appointed an as
sistant to United States Attorney
George Hatfield of San Francisco. Dun
nell was chief deputy district attorney
of Solano county for four years and
has been practicing law in Fairfield.
