temporary French art.
In art circles Dr. Faure is well known
for his four-volume work on the his
tory of art, which traces its evolution
of art, based on political and social
structure, from ancient to modem
times. In addition to their being an ex
cellent survey of the world's art, the
books are highly regarded for their
critical value.
Faure has also written numerous
criticisms for magazines and periodi
cals and many of his books, written on
different phases of sculpture, archi
tecture and painting have been pub
lished.
As he is a physician, the scientist's
knowledge and point of view are re
flected in Faure's work, and he inex
tricably mingles thought on social ques
tions, disclosing that art and its devel
opment connects with racial and eco
nomical evolution. He is a lover of
beauty and an enthusiastic speaker on
that subject.
The speaker comes to Stanford from
Mexico, where he has spent the sum

is especially interested in the work of
Diego Rivera, a well known Mexican
artist. He is now visiting friends in
San Francisco and expects to sail with
in a few days for Japan.
Dr. Faure was one of the founders
of the Universite Populaire in France.
