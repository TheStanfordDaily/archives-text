# STANFORD STUDENTS RETURN FROM FRESNO STATE SUMMER CAMP
## 
### 
Living in tents, attending classes held
out of doors, doing their own cooking,
and wearing hiking clothes to class,
was part of the summer school program
enjoyed by four Stanford students who
this summer attended the Fresno State
College summer session held at Hunt
ington Lake.
Elizabeth Werthman, '32; Claire Fer
guson, '32; Robert de Roos, '33, and
Franklin P. Gribbin, '32, have finished
a six-weeks' course at the school in
the Sierras, and have returned to tell
tales of the green benches and awnings
which served as classrooms, the outdoor
"Sierra Forest Theatre," and the swim
ming, riding, hiking, and boating which
were offered as recreation.
That Stanford's-sqns and daughters
did not shrink into the background is
evidenced by the position that Gribbin
held as student body president, de
Roos' participation on the weekly "Si
erran," Miss Ferguson's singing at a
student body assembly, and Miss
Werthman's appearance in a play "The
Modern Shop," in the outdoor theater.
When questioned concerning the
course of study, Miss Werthman joy
fully announced that the maximum
number of units for any student was
six, or nine under the Stanford quar
ter system. Courses were offered in
economics, English, biology, astronomy,
history, physical education, art, and
stagecraft.
The students, numbering about 300,
lived in tents and cabins near the lake,
and did their own cooking. Dances
were held every Friday night in one
of the few buildings on the "campus."
Since the region has but recently
been made a game preserve, there is
little wild life at present. "Except,"
said Miss Werthman, "the mice."
