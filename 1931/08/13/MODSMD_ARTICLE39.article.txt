## 
### 
"I belong to a trade union," said
Charles S. Eade, London journalist who
visited Stanford Tuesday and was
.shown about the campus by a member
of the Daily staff. "I believe so heart
ily in working newspaper men belong
ing to a union that I insisted on retain
ing my membership even when I was
owner of my own paper. After all,
with reporters and sub-editors it is a
matter of dollars and cents and the
union has been effective in securing
stable wages, reasonable hours and
other benefits.
"We are affiliated with the Typo
graphical Union, but do not agree to
strike if that union does. We did not
in the great general strike; not all of
us approved of that strike. The Insti
tute of Journalists is a good thing lor
the higher editors and highbrow jour
nalists, but it does not afford the pro
tection to the ordinary man on the job
that that union does.
Eade is traveling around the world
in leisurely fashion, devoting two years
to the trip and penetrating to the in
terior of countries he visits instead of
skirting along from port to port.
He joined the staff of the London
Mirror when he was sixteen years old,
and has since been on several other
London papers and has been owner of
a suburban paper nearby.
