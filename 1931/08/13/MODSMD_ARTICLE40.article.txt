# VOLSTEAD ACT RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY NEW WORDS, LOCAL INVESTIGATOR FINDS
## 
### 
The extensive coinage of new words
and a novel significance given to al
ready existing ones is a result of the
adoption of national prohibition <nd
the passage of the Volstead Act in 1920
—a result which, in all probably, was
not anticipated. These are the conclu
sions of Achsuh Alice Hardin, who pre
sented before Dr. Louise Pound's class
in American English, an exhaustive list
of such words and phrases she found
in various kinds of writing from dif
ferent levels of society. One of her ref
erences was an article in "American
Speech" on "Stanford Expressions."
"Wet" is a familiar term for those
favoring the repeal of the Eighteenth
amendment, but its varying degrees,
beginning with "dampish" and becom
ing "as wet as the Atlantic Ocean" are
not so well known. Among the varia
tions are "moist" and "pessimistically
wet," "dripping wet," and "wet enough
for rubber boots," On the other hand,
there are all the degrees of 'dryness":
"medium dry," "optimistically dry,"
"cracker dry," "ultra-dry," "fanatical
dry," and "most arid."
"Drymedaries and Weaslers"
Miss Hardin has found 23 terms re
ferring to factions and party organiza
tions, including the familiar "Prohibi
tionists," and the less familiar "Dryme
daries," and "Weaslers." There are 19
terms referring to representatives of
the law, of which "pay-off-on-a-pinch"

and "gumboot" are examples.
One who drinks intoxicating liquors j
may be called any one of 17 names, i
among them, "funnel," "barrel house i
bum," or ordinary "tank." The "speak- |
easy" may also be a "red onion" or a !
"moonlight inn" or any of the 16 other j
things. A "bootlegger" may be a "pour- j
out-man" or a dozen other names, ac- I
cording to the taste of his customers, i
"Booze" Has Curious History
The intoxicating beverage itself may !
be designated by any one of 73 terms, j
among them the expressive "nose j
paint," or "tonsil bath," "veeno" or |
"who shot John?" "mountain dew," or
'third rail," not to mention any num- !
ber of more familiar terms. One's I
state of intoxication may be expressed |
in 110 different ways, some of them j
synonymous, some of them referring |
to degrees of intoxication, some of .them j
limited to a certain level of society, or I
a section of tlie country, but all of j
them most expressive. Among the more j
unfamiliar ones are "three sheets in
the wind," "farahead," and "ossified."
The slang term "booze" has a curi
ous history, being almost universal, as 1
Miss Hardin discovered. It is the Mid- j
die English "bouse," the Russian "bu- i
sa," the Latin "buza" (from "buo," I |
fill), the Welch "bozi," the old Dutch j
"buyzen," the German 'bauzen," the ,
Dutch "buise" and "buis," the Arabic i
"buze," the Persian "buza," the Hindu i
"buza," "boza," the Turkish 'boza" and
the Coptic "bouza."
Some of the terms of Volstead Eng- J
lish are finding their way into other
fields of industry, as "bootlegging,in
meaning not only illicit trade in liquor,
but in other articles, as well.

The slang term "booze" has a curi
ous history, being almost universal, as 1
Miss Hardin discovered. It is the Mid- j
die English "bouse," the Russian "bu- i
sa," the Latin "buza" (from "buo," I |
fill), the Welch "bozi," the old Dutch j
"buyzen," the German 'bauzen," the ,
Dutch "buise" and "buis," the Arabic i
"buze," the Persian "buza," the Hindu i
"buza," "boza," the Turkish 'boza" and
the Coptic "bouza."
Some of the terms of Volstead Eng- J
lish are finding their way into other
fields of industry, as "bootlegging,in
meaning not only illicit trade in liquor,
but in other articles, as well.
The extensive coinage of new words
and a novel significance given to al
ready existing ones is a result of the
adoption of national prohibition <nd
the passage of the Volstead Act in 1920
—a result which, in all probably, was
not anticipated. These are the conclu
sions of Achsuh Alice Hardin, who pre
sented before Dr. Louise Pound's class
in American English, an exhaustive list
of such words and phrases she found
in various kinds of writing from dif
ferent levels of society. One of her ref
erences was an article in "American
Speech" on "Stanford Expressions."
"Wet" is a familiar term for those
favoring the repeal of the Eighteenth
amendment, but its varying degrees,
beginning with "dampish" and becom
ing "as wet as the Atlantic Ocean" are
not so well known. Among the varia
tions are "moist" and "pessimistically
wet," "dripping wet," and "wet enough
for rubber boots," On the other hand,
there are all the degrees of 'dryness":
"medium dry," "optimistically dry,"
"cracker dry," "ultra-dry," "fanatical
dry," and "most arid."
"Drymedaries and Weaslers"
Miss Hardin has found 23 terms re
ferring to factions and party organiza
tions, including the familiar "Prohibi
tionists," and the less familiar "Dryme
daries," and "Weaslers." There are 19
terms referring to representatives of
the law, of which "pay-off-on-a-pinch"

and "gumboot" are examples.
One who drinks intoxicating liquors j
may be called any one of 17 names, i
among them, "funnel," "barrel house i
bum," or ordinary "tank." The "speak- |
easy" may also be a "red onion" or a !
"moonlight inn" or any of the 16 other j
things. A "bootlegger" may be a "pour- j
out-man" or a dozen other names, ac- I
cording to the taste of his customers, i
"Booze" Has Curious History
The intoxicating beverage itself may !
be designated by any one of 73 terms, j
among them the expressive "nose j

"who shot John?" "mountain dew," or
'third rail," not to mention any num- !
ber of more familiar terms. One's I
state of intoxication may be expressed |
in 110 different ways, some of them j
synonymous, some of them referring |
to degrees of intoxication, some of .them j
limited to a certain level of society, or I
a section of tlie country, but all of j
them most expressive. Among the more j
unfamiliar ones are "three sheets in
the wind," "farahead," and "ossified."
