### 
Gilbert Wrenn, assistant in voca
tional guidance has returned 'to the
campus from the University of Oregon,
where he has been teaching this sum
mer at the Portland session. Attending
his classes on vocational guidance were
100 high school principals and counsel
lors.
All over the country the importance
of helping students decide for which
vocation they are best adapted is being
recognized and here at Stanford a par
ticular department has been crÂ«nted to
assist the students, Wrenn said. In se
lection of vocations, Dr. E. K. Strong's
interest test for men is sometimes used
as are various personality tests.
An Interest Test for Women
This fall an interest test for women
will be utilized for the first time. This
test was made up by Dr. Grace Masson
of the psychology department of North
western University.
Stanford is also planning this fall to
issue a pamphlet on "How to Study,"
which not only will outline the best
method to be employed in studying,
but also will contain other data bene
ficial to freshmen, Wrenn explained.
Other Stanford People in Oregon
While in Oregon, Wrenn gave a talk
on vocational guidance before the State
Tubercular Hospital, endeavoring to as
sist the patients in finding some occu
pation to divert their minds. He also
spoke before the Kiwanis Club in Van
couver.
Other Stanford people who taught
at Oregon this summer are Charles
Reynolds, associate professor of sociol
ogy; David Harris, assistant progessor
of history, and Flaud C. Wooton, who
