# METEOR DISPLAY SEEN AS PERSEIDS REACHES MID-SIMMER CLIMAX
## F. A. Lucy, Graduate Student, Notes Shower of 16 In Half Hour 
### 
Sixteen meteors were seen in half
an hour on Tuesday night by Frank
Allen Lucy, graduate student in chem
istry. Lucy watched the annual show
er of August meteors, known as Per
seids, which reached its maximum I hat
night.
According to Lucy, the meteors were
seen as long blazing streaks, of which
the first, the fifth, the twelfth, and the
sixteenth were especially cospicuous.
The twelfth, he said, must have ex
tended over 50 miles, and then disap
peared behind the clouds.
The Perseids, so named because of
their apparent radiation from the con
stellation Perseus, are visible from the
middle of July to the middle of Au
gust, reaching their period of greatest
activity on the night of August 11. A
meteor shower occurs when a stream of
meteors crosses the earth's orbit, and
the Perseids are so scattered about in
their orbits that we encounter them
every year. The date of their greatest
activity advances one day every 70
years.
The meteors, which are the most con
spicuous and the most dependable of
the various meteor showers, are ex
tremely small, one as large as a golf
ball being unusually large, but they are
known as extremely spectacular.
