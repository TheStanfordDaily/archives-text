The book comes as a contribution from
the Yearbook of Stanford Writing for
1931 to the author contributing the
best work to the yearbook.

the book, won the Irene Hardy Poetry
Prize, given in alternate years through
the English Department. Seven other
poems and eight sonnets complete tne
contents. Dawless has published work
in several periodicals and has acted on
the stage in New York and Philadel

"Discovery," the title poem, discloses
a philosophic theme in a pastoral set
ting. Replete with nouns and verbs
the poem has charm, motion, and spirit.
Each piece in the book is delicately but
definately etched, and there is a pro
fusion of references to hills, grasses,
and winds. â€¢

sition for the book, which catches the
spirit with black and green cover and
silver lettering. Inside, alternate pages
are rough edged, and on the bufl paper
contrast light green tailpieces.
