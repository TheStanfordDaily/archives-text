# HOOPS TO SPEAK ON ARCHITECTURE
## Slides Will Show the Modern Trends in Germany 
### 
"Modern German Architecture" is
the title of a lecture to be given at 8
o'clock Monday night in the Little
Theatre, by Dr. Reinald Hoops, acting
assistant professor of German. The talk
will be illustrated with lantern slides,
many of which were brought from the
University of Glasgow, where Dr.
Hoops is a professor.
The speaker proposes to discuss the
main characteristics of the new Ger
man architecture, its development in
recent years, to tell how it is in accord
with the other changes which have re
cently taken place in Germany, and
will point out how this architecture
expresses the governing spirit of that
country. He will sliow how this new
spirit has penetrated all fields of archi
tecture, factories, public buildings, bus
iness houses, private homes, interiors,
and churches. The latter phase is of
especial interest, because here, in many
cases, century-old traditions have been
discarded and work on new lines has
been started.
Hoops will then go into the matter of
style, showing how the new style in
architecture is but a part of a new style
in all fields of present-day life. Finally,
he will draw attention to the fact that
under our very eyes a change in style
is taking place, that this modern archi
tecture has already passed through its
first stage, and that it is on the point
of entering the second, of developing
into another and newer style.
This lecture is the fourth of a se
ries of five, which have been given on
consecutive Mondays. The last will be
given on August 24, in the Little Thsa
ter. Its subject will be "Oberammer
gau." and it will be illustrated with
lanter nslides.
