# SAMUEL HUNGERFORD, VIOLINIST, TO ASSIST AT WARREN RECITAL
## 
### 
A program of organ music by Franz
i Liszt will be played in the Memorial
Chapel at 7:30 o'clock Sunday evening,
by Warren D. Allen. Samuel Hunger-
I ford will play two violin numbers, in
: addition to the organ music. They will
j be: "Adagio from the Violin Sonata,
Opus 108," by Johannes Brahms, and
Max Burch's "Adagio from the Violin
Concerto, Opus 26."
The Lizst numbers will include "Evo
cation a la Chapelle Sixtine," which is
i based upon the "Miserere (Allegri)"
| and Mozart's' "Ave Verum." Liszt's
i fame as a pianist has obscured his gen
ius as a composer, but in his little
! known organ music critics aver that
one gets a glimpse of the mystic gen
ius of the great artist whose inspira
â€¢ tion made possible Wagner's music
| dramas.
Other Liszt offerings will be "An
gelus (Piere aux Anges Gardiens),'
"Ora Pro Nobis," and "Fantasia 'Ad
Nos Salutarem Undam'." The last is
based upon a chorale sung by the Ana
baptists in Act 111 of "Le Prophete,'
by Meyerbeer. Saint-Saens pronounced
this the "most extraordinary piece ever
I written for the organ." Mr. Allen will
i present the piece in an abridged form
without the concluding fugue, since
in its complete form the work is rather
i long.
Old world folk music will be played
, in the chapel thi*afternoon by Mr. Al
len at 4:15. The program will include
numbers by Greig, Brahms, Gigout,
| Hanson, Borodin, and Bonnet.
