\ orful program. The crowd accepted
I their difficult dives with enthusiasm,
] especially those from the 27-foot tower,
j The five-event pentathlon was cap
tured by James Benet, former Menlo
School swimmer. He nosed out "Chuck"
j Boothe by the slim margin of one point,
Benet having a total of 19 points and
, the former Los Angeles high school
' star, 18. The two leaders were closely
pressed by Harry Baskerville, who did
S not perform in his usual style. He was
'followed by Felix Juda, Nate Messer,
J and Irwin Tway.
Baskerville Wins Free-Style

J style race, the initial event on the pro
; gram, when he defeated Boothe by a
J stroke, in 24.4 seconds. Benet and Juda

ception that Juda outswam Benet to

Benet Wins Over Baskerville
With Ed. Throndson acting as judge
and Felix Juda supplying the comedy,
the diving from the three-foot board
completed the pentathlon. Baskerville
lost to Benet in the spring board event
when he failed to execute his dives
with the fineness that he usually ex
hibits in practice. The former Menlo
athlete gained the approval of the judge
when he accomplished the running one
and a-half front flip in good form.
Baskerville failed in his first two dives
but redeemed himself in the others, to
place a close second, Boothe was third

sprinted him at the end to take the sec
ond position. Bill Erskine came in a
close fourth. Brammel received the
Ed. Zwierlein trophy for his victory.
Change Night-Shirts Too Slow
A comedy night-shirt relay race was
captured by the "A" team composed of
Jurs, Russ, Avery and Haight, when
their opponents, the "B" team, failed
to make the necessary change of the
night-gown with dispatch. They m-ide
the mistake of stopping to see that the
garment was not inside out, whereas
their conquerors were not thinking of
appearances, but were swimming to
win.
The final event on the program, the
water-polo game was won by the
"White" team composed of Fowler,
Burns, De Silva, Juda, Throndson, Mc-
Dowell and Haight. The scox-e was 3-0.
The starter for the events was
Thornton; judges, Osel Freeman and

Baskerville Wins Free-Style
Baskerville won the 50-yard free-
J style race, the initial event on the pro
; gram, when he defeated Boothe by a
J stroke, in 24.4 seconds. Benet and Juda
j were tied for third and Tway was
fifth. The race was almost duplicated
in the 100-yard free-style with the ex
ception that Juda outswam Benet to
take third place. Baskerville's time was
1 minute 4.2 seconds.
Benet took the 50-yard breast stroke,
Boothe was second, and F. Juda, Mes
ser and H. Juda finished in the order
named. The time was 36.6 seconds.
The back stroke over the same dis
tance ended in a tie between Benet and
Felix Juda. "Chuck" Boothe again
placed second, with Baskerville and
Tway finishing in order. The watch
registered 36.7 seconds.
Benet Wins Over Baskerville
With Ed. Throndson acting as judge
and Felix Juda supplying the comedy,
the diving from the three-foot board
completed the pentathlon. Baskerville
lost to Benet in the spring board event
when he failed to execute his dives
with the fineness that he usually ex
hibits in practice. The former Menlo
athlete gained the approval of the judge
when he accomplished the running one
and a-half front flip in good form.
Baskerville failed in his first two dives
but redeemed himself in the others, to
place a close second, Boothe was third
and Messer and Felix Juda, fourth and
fifth, respectively.
In the feature sprinting event, the
100-yard free-style for varsity swim
mers, Hadley Brammel showed his
heels to a fast field in the fast time of
56.1 seconds. Ward Woods, usually a
good finisher, had to be satisfied with
third place when Gordie Graves out
sprinted him at the end to take the sec
ond position. Bill Erskine came in a
close fourth. Brammel received the
Ed. Zwierlein trophy for his victory.

A comedy night-shirt relay race was
captured by the "A" team composed of
Jurs, Russ, Avery and Haight, when
their opponents, the "B" team, failed
to make the necessary change of the
night-gown with dispatch. They m-ide
the mistake of stopping to see that the
garment was not inside out, whereas
their conquerors were not thinking of
appearances, but were swimming to
win.
The final event on the program, the

Dowell and Haight. The scox-e was 3-0.
