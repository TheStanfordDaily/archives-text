Derrick Norman Lehmer, professor

sistant professor of English at Stanford,
will give a program of folk songs in
the Women's Clubhouse, at 7:30 o'clock
Thursday evening. Esther Murray An
derson will be accompanist.

The program which will be composed
of Indian songs sung by D. Lehmer,
and English and Scottish ballads sung
by Dr. Bailey, is being presented pri
marily for Dr. Louise Pound's class in
English and Scottish Ballads, and Foik-
Songs. However it is open to the pub
lic.

Mr. Lehmer's songs are American In
dian folk songs which he, himself, has
collected among the Western Indians,
and harmonized. Most of his collection
was taken down by means of records
and are authentic airs. He has made
expeditions into New Mexico, the Yo
semite, and Washington in these re
searches. The program will include
songs from the Chippewa, Hopi, Pomo,
Miwok tribes and from the Eskimos.

Dr. Lehmer is editor of the Uni
versity of California Chronicle, a quar
terly literary magazine. He is a poet,
and member of several literary and
mathematics clubs in America and
England. His works as a composer of
music include "Seven Songs from the
Yosemite Valley," "Down the Stream,
and other Indian songs," two Indian
choruses, and music for an Indian Mask
given at Bozeman, Montana, in June,
1927.

The privilege of hearing some of Dr.
Lehmer's songs is due to the presence
of Dr. Pound on the campus this sum
mer. They have been friends since
college days in Nebraska, where they
both took their A.B. degree.
