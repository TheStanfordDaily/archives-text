# KEYNOTE OF NEW ARCHITECTURE IS SIMPLICITY-HOOPS
## Influence of Steel, Glass, and Concrete Is Seen in German Buildings 
### 
"The increased use of glass, steel and
j concrete, resulted in the development
lof modern architecture in Germany,"
i said Dr. Reinald Hoops, acting profes
sor of German, when speaking on
"Modern German Architecture" in the
Little Theatre last night.
"This new type of architecture, which
is is characterized by entirely new lines
and the abandonment of old ideas, has
developed within the last 15 or 20
years," he declared.

Lack of Ornaments Noted
By showing slides of factories, public
buildings, schools, and theatres, Dr.
j Hoops demonstrated that imitation had
' been purposely neglected, and that
j simplicity, straight forwardness, and
j efficiency were manifested in the new

style.
"The lack of ornaments and decora
! tions, and the extensive use of win-

i dows also characterize the new Ger
man architecture," declared Dr. Hoops.

Shows Slides of Homes
"After the war," continued Hoops,
i "housing conditions in Germany were
deplorable, and many new houses had
to be built. As a result, all the bigger
cities developed housing schemes in
i which the houses were arranged and
j built in the modern style. These houses,
| arranged in the form of a horseshoe or
! a square, are conspicuous because of
their many windows, straight lines,
; lack of ornaments, and their prox
imity."
Dr. Hoops concluded his lecture by
i showing slides of the interiors of mod
ern German homes and said that they
j also were characterized by straight
lines, blank walls, simplicity of design,
and many windows, all of which make
! for efficiency and cleanliness.
