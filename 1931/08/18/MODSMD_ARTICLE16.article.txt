# WAR IS DECLARED ON ANTS IN TOYON HALL
## 
### 
Stepping out i.nto the corridors Sun- j
; day morning, Toyon Hall residents no- I
ticcd the strong odor of a well known j
[ "bug killer." The insecticide has been 1
sprayed along the edges of the hall- |
I ways with the hope that it would stop 1
i the invasion of ants, which have be- j
! seiged the place all summer to the i
| great discomfort of the residents.
| Practicing the etiquette of com-
I munism, these unbidden guests are '
I equally unpartieular as to diet. Even
' bars of soap arc delicacies on the ant
I menu.
