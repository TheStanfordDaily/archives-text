With a successful production of three
one-act plays widely varied in type
and appeal, Stanford's Little Theatre
became a thing of life and promise Fri
day evening. Student directors pre
sented plays by authors of repute and
ability—plays which were difficult to
produce.
Acting in the capacity of both di
rector and actor, Harry Lee Logan gave
an excellent production of Pirandello's
drama, "The Vise," with June Birch -
ard as his melodramatic wife, and Jo
seph Sloss as the rival, Antonio SeiTa,
a lawyer.
Tragedy Presented With Skill
One of the best of its type, Edna St.
Vincent Millay's fantasy, "Aria da
Capo," was received a bit more humor
ously perhaps by the audience than the
author or the director or the actors ex
pected.
Under the direction of Howard Cus
ter, this ironic and truly tragic play
was well done, with honors among the
actors quite evenly divided. Perhaps
a bit too charming and naive to be
tragically convincing were the shepherd
and shepherdess, played by George An
dreini and Irene Goldenberg. Mary
Purdy and Jack Pettker as Columbine
and Pierrot gave nice interpretations
to those fantastical characters.
Whitaker Scores as New Yorker
Joseph Whitaker again scored as a
New Yorker, in Alfred Sutro's comedy
of modern life, "The Man in the Stalls,"
which Lucile Morgan directed. Marian
Littlefield and William Mahu turned in
fine performances.
More pleasing presentations have not
been seen in the Little Theater for some
time. They were given entirely by
students in the classes in Acting, Di
recting, and Theater Workshop, under
the supervision of their instructors.
