# PROFESSOR E. G. REID PRAISES KEITH RIDER'S RACING PLANE DESIGN
## 
### 
Professor Elliott Gray Reid of the
Aerodynamics department yesterday
praised Keith Rider for his work as
designer of the twin racing planes
which have been under secret con
struction in San Francisco, in prepara
tion for the National Air Races at
Cleveland August 29 to September 7.
Professor Reid has been in touch
with Rider during the past year and
has viewed the plans at various stages
of development.
The aim of the new design, Profes
sor Reid says, is to develop an effi
cient racer weighing under 1,000 pounds
and powered by a relatively light en
gine.
The lighter of the two planes will
fly in the Derby, a cross-country race
starting from the Pacific Coast and end
ing at Cleveland. The other more pow
erful ship will compete for the Thomp
son Trophy, an unlimited speed event.
While he declined to estimate a pos
sible speed for the latter, Professor Reid
is certain that it will travel faster than
any of last year's entries in the Thomp
son Trophy. He indicated that test
flights will be made in a few days.
