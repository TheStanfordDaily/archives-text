# First Woman to Register Here Is Now Grandmother of Seven
## 
### 
| The first woman to register at Stan- j
j ford is Mrs. William Wheeler Dunworth,
now of Miami, Fla., who matriculated j
in 1891. This fact has recently come j
! to the notice of the office of J. E. Mc- j
Dowell, alumni secretary, in response
to questionnaires sent out for the pur- j
pose of compiling an alumni directory. '
Mrs. Dunworth came to Stanford sev- I
eral days before the first registration |
day and procured living accommoda- |
1 tions in Palo Alto. Before registration
| she spent her time helping prepare Ro- j
j ble Hall for occupancy. She says that I
Mrs. Stanford finally noticed her and
| put her in charge of the unpacking '

Jand placing of the furniture.
Financial reverses in the family
| caused the first woman to withdraw
' from the University within a few
) months. She says that those few
months have greatly influenced her
| life.
Herbert Hoover was in her English
I class here, and Hay Lyman Wilbur sat
J across the aisle from her in the River
-1 side High School. t
Mis. Dunworth has lived in Miami
I for the last 25 years and is the grand
-1 mother of seven. She is now in her
fourth term as president of the \meri
' can Children's Home.
