# THE 						NEW TRAFFIC SIGNALS
## 
### 
Much needed and very welcome was the installation of
"stop" and "no" lights at the Palm Drive Highway intersection.
Rut the traffic signals are not effectively controlling automo
biles. Every day a number of students and others crossing the
highway upon the green light are barely missed by motorists
speeding across the intersection in total disregard or ignorance
of the red lights.
There is a weakness in the new system —what it is, we can
not say. It is up to the state highway department to study the
problem and arrange a solution.
The Palo Alto police department—when a student who'just
missed being hit at the intersection because of a tourist's going
through the red lights complained at the city station—explained
that there is always a certain amount of confusion whenever
tratlic signals are newly installed.
This is true enough, but we can not 'fully accept the explana
tion. The signals are always going to be "new" to the many
tourists who daily come down the highway. The lights will have
to be made known to all motorists who pass the intersection.
We wonder it the signals are placed as best to direct tratlic.
We wonder if larger and more cross lines painted on the high
way some distance from the lights would not help.
One thing which we are certain is wrong, is the position of
the recent "Stop at the Red Light" signs. These signals should
be back another one hundred and fifty feet or more from the
signals, for tlicy are now so close to the lights that they are not
seen until the driver is nearly upon the intersection.
The new tratlic signals are a very good thing, but they must
become more effective than they now are, or there will be seri
ous accidents—accidents that are every day averted by but nar
row margins.
