# "BALLYHOO"â€”WE LIKE IT
## 
### 
A new magazine appeared in Hie newsstands iwo months
ago. It is "Ballyhoo." We sort ol' like it. It is a takeoff on ad
vertisements and also borrows a hit from "Life" and "Judge."
What we like about it is not its good writing nor its suggestive
college-monthly type of jokes. We like its sentiments. It ex
presses all of us.
We're all tired of the blatant extravaganzas in many na
tional advertisements. "Ballyhoo" suggests: "Buy yourself
some false teeth with the money you save on tooth paste! . . .
Why buy tooth paste? .. . Blisterine Tooth Paste saves you three
dollars a year, but if you don't buy anv, you save six dollars.
Don't buy any!"
This mockery may be more or less "good" advertising for the
national companies mocked, but is great reading if nothing else.
"Ballyhoo" is master showmanship. It plays on the foibles of
the twentieth century.
As good as .anything in its two issues is perhaps the back
page advertisement of "The largest selling ham in the world . . .
The Ham What Am." The illustration is a lace-less suggestion
of a jazz crooner whom we all tune off' from on "Yeast Night,"
and under his arm is a big ham.
