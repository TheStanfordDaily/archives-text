# "FIRESIDES OR FORMULAE"
## 
### 
Stanford University was recently host to a meeting of educa
tors. Speeches were made by Will C. Wood, former stale super
intendent of schools and bv Dr. John C. Almack of Stanford.
Wood declared lluil modern business wants men with a general
education whereas Almack observed that universities would
render best services in the form of selective professional schools.
These two statements reflect different educational philoso
phies, yet neither one contains the whole truth for present needs.
American business, world affairs, might profitably use flexible,
original thinkers iu the present crisis. II is obvious that "rule of
thumb-ers," no matter how adept, are in serious trouble. Their
conservatism is damnatory. Rut they have a legitimate function
to put the thing over, once il is conceived.
The middle ages saw empiricism give way to the experi
mental method. II has made our modern world. The question
now stands, "Men or Machines?" Rut Ihe answer is, "Men and
Machines." We need bigger dreamers than ever were, to see the
thing steadily and see it whole, and we need practical specialists
lo put the plans over. American education could well take a tip
from ils own knowledge and teach the hard facts concerning
science and government before the age of sixteen, when most
minds have reached maximum potentiality. Truths are seen by
too few, through no fault of theirs. We need Plato, firesides, and
pipes; we need laboratories, test-tubes, and formulae. And dis
agreeing with Dr. A1 mack's selective sentiment, we need more
of both.

American universities arc faced vvilli this dilemma. Some
how and sometime during his collegiate adventure the searcher
must discover the beauties of his culture as well as his life work.
In the face of criticism from both camps Stanford has made her
choice not forgetting scholarship, she does train specialties.
