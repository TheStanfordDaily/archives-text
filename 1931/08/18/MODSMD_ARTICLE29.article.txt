Grades may not bring happiness to the recipients, but they
can be made the source of happiness to some under-privileged
children which Stanford makes her wards through the Conva
lescent Home. The slight profit on the stamped envelopes which
the Registrar's ollice provides at a nickel apiece for mailing
grades is all devoted to the Home, bringing in each year a tidy
little sum that enables some extension of Stanford's own charity
that would otherwise be impossible.
