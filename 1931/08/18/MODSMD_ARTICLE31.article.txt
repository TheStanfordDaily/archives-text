# COACHING STAFF WILL LEAVE ON VACATIONS AT END OF QUARTER
## 
### 
Shaking the campus dust from their
shoes upon the completion of the quar
ter, Stanford's coaching department
will leave on many divergent trails to
seek rest and recreation in "thj wide
open places." All will be back by the
opening of the fall quarter to resume
their coaching duties.

Myron Schall is perhaps making the
longest trip, in traveling to his home
in Monte Vista, Colo. He does not ex
pect to be back on the campus until
September UO. Norton Thornton, as-

sistant swimming director, will go to
Corvallis, Oregon, to visit his mother.
He expects to be gone two weeks.

Harry Maloney will work in the
Stanford Hospital for two weeks and
then will spend the rest of his time in
Southern California. John Bunn, bas
ketball coach, will join Mrs. Bunn in
La Jolla, on the southern border of
the state, to enjoy swimming and deep
sea fishing. He will return to Palo Alto
about the middle of September and
from there expects to make several
short hunting trips.

Elwyn B. Bugge, tennis director, will
leave for Seattle, his home city. He
intends to climb all the mountains he
can find in the adjacent country. He
claims mountain scaling is his favorite
summer sport.

"Pop" Warner and "Tiny" Thornhill
are already following the trail of the
fish and their whereabouts is unknown.
Somewhere in Montana or even Colo
rado, best describes their location.
However, it is assured that they will
be back on the campus in time to ful
fill a motion picture contract calling
for production to begin on the first of
September. "Chuck" Winterburn, as
sistant football coach, has just returned
from a vacation in Yosemite and Del
Monte.
"Dink" Templeton has returned from
his stay at the Hables Inn in Oregon
and will spend his spare time trying
to break par on the local golf course.
He may take some trips next month
although he says none are planned as
yet. Harry Wolter, baseball coach, will
follow "Dink's" method and remain on
the campus with some golf playing for
recreation. He does not contemplate
making any long trips.
