# FAURE SAYS PRIMITIVE PEOPLES BASIS FOR TRUE MODERN ART
## 
### 
"Although new cycles of art are be
ing continually evolved, each country s
art should be based on its primitive
people." This was the keynote of Dr.
Elie Faure's lecture yesterday after
noon in the Little Theater.

He urged Americans to mold their
artistry on the Indian, the original
people of this continent, and extolled
the work of Diego Rivera for his inter
pretation of the life of the Mexican
Indian. Dr. Faure has been in Mexico
this summer studying modern Mexican

In his lecture he traced the evolution
of art through the various epics of
history and pointed out that in each
period there was a definite rise and
fall. In the beginning of a cycle there
is the "symphonic" art, vague, global
or mass in its interpretation, out of
which architecture is born. Architec
ture in Dr. Faure's opinion is the form
of art, which best expresses the spirit
of a country.
From the period of architecture,
which is anonymous, individualism de
velops, and sculpture emerges. After
sculpture comes painting, which is
more individualistic. As this branch of
art does not truly express the sensi
bilities and emotions of a people, mu
sic becomes the last link in the cycle of
art development and then as history
discloses an upheaval occurs and a new
cycle or epic arises.
Dr. Faure yesterday afternoon illus
trated his points by briefly surveying
the history of art from the ancient
Greek and Romans, to modern French
and American. He eulogizes the mod
ern trend of impressionism with its
broad simplicity and color and little
attention to detail.
"In America the architecture is a
most complete and admirable product
of your civilization," Dr. Faure said.
He remarked that in his opinion Los
Angeles was the capital of modern art
