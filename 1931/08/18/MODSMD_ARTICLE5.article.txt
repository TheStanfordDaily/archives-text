# "FROLICS ELICITS HEAVY APPLAUSE
## Stanfordites in Hit; Voorhies Scores With Dance 
### 
Against a background of verdant fol
iage the "Summer Frolics," the musical j
revue of the Palo Alto recreation cen
ter, was presented Friday night in the
Community House Outdoor Theater.

Good dancing was the major attrac- i
tion, but there were excellent musical j
numbers and clever bits of comedy.
Chief applause went to Virginia Voor
hies for her two interpretive dances,
"In an Indian Temple," a nautch dance,
and "Valse Triste." In the latter num
ber the lighting effects produced by
Dan Gerlough, Walter Bayha and
James Fisher were exceptionally good.
"Doll," "Hick" Dances Applauded

The dance "Soldier Dolls," performed j
by nine children won the hearts of |
the audience. "The "dolls" were Bev- j
erly Engley, Jean Whitson, Virginia |

Barry, Eileen Johnson, Viola Morris, i
Rose Fann Newburgh, Betty Lou Berry,
June Gilkey and Patty Hoagland. "Tr.e
Hick Dance," performed by Margaret
Steele, Jean Myers and Margaret Ste
henne, pupils of Genevieve Cunning
ham of Redwood City, was also en
thusiastically applauded, as was Miss
Cunningham's clever dance, "The Dutch
Girl.'"
