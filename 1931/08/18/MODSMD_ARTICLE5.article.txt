# "FROLICS ELICITS HEAVY APPLAUSE
## Stanfordites in Hit; Voorhies Scores With Dance 
### 
Against a background of verdant fol
iage the "Summer Frolics," the musical j
revue of the Palo Alto recreation cen
ter, was presented Friday night in the
Community House Outdoor Theater.

Good dancing was the major attrac- i
tion, but there were excellent musical j
numbers and clever bits of comedy.
Chief applause went to Virginia Voor
hies for her two interpretive dances,
"In an Indian Temple," a nautch dance,
and "Valse Triste." In the latter num
ber the lighting effects produced by
Dan Gerlough, Walter Bayha and
James Fisher were exceptionally good.
"Doll," "Hick" Dances Applauded

The dance "Soldier Dolls," performed j
by nine children won the hearts of |
the audience. "The "dolls" were Bev- j
erly Engley, Jean Whitson, Virginia |

Barry, Eileen Johnson, Viola Morris, i
Rose Fann Newburgh, Betty Lou Berry,
June Gilkey and Patty Hoagland. "Tr.e
Hick Dance," performed by Margaret
Steele, Jean Myers and Margaret Ste
henne, pupils of Genevieve Cunning
ham of Redwood City, was also en
thusiastically applauded, as was Miss
Cunningham's clever dance, "The Dutch
Girl.'"
and from the gymnasium.
Jupy's education has not been nog- j
lected. He has taken Personal Hygiene j
every quarter since he came here, two j
years ago, and that, combined wiih :
whatever he may have gleaned from ,
his owner's conferences with students,
should constitute an unusually thor
ough medical knowledge for a Great
Dane.
His sense of humor is one of his most |
remarkable features. Jupy takes par
licular delight in terrifying timid peo- ;
pie by uttering a casual "woof" to
which his mammoth form lends all
the aspects of a dragon's growl.
Grin Follows "Woof'
His wide grin usually follows his
tricks. Dr. Dyment was the object of
one practical joke in which Jupiter
would pretend to run away wilh her
golf ball after she had driven off, only
to sit by and grin while she found the
ball in the proper place.
The canine occupant of Roble gymna
sium is five years old, has won several
ribbons in dog shows, and would have
been entered in an Oakland dog show
if the honor had not necessitated sta> -
ing away from home all night. As a
watchdog, he has only to show his
size and say "woof" to frighten the
nerviest of thieves, and as a pal, Dr.
Dyment says, "he understands evciy
thing I say to him."

His wide grin usually follows his

Against a background of verdant fol

revue of the Palo Alto recreation cen
ter, was presented Friday night in the
Community House Outdoor Theater.

Good dancing was the major attrac- i
tion, but there were excellent musical j
numbers and clever bits of comedy.
Chief applause went to Virginia Voor
hies for her two interpretive dances,
"In an Indian Temple," a nautch dance,
and "Valse Triste." In the latter num
ber the lighting effects produced by
Dan Gerlough, Walter Bayha and
James Fisher were exceptionally good.
"Doll," "Hick" Dances Applauded

The dance "Soldier Dolls," performed j
by nine children won the hearts of |
the audience. "The "dolls" were Bev- j
erly Engley, Jean Whitson, Virginia |

Barry, Eileen Johnson, Viola Morris, i
Rose Fann Newburgh, Betty Lou Berry,
June Gilkey and Patty Hoagland. "Tr.e
Hick Dance," performed by Margaret
Steele, Jean Myers and Margaret Ste
henne, pupils of Genevieve Cunning
ham of Redwood City, was also en
thusiastically applauded, as was Miss
Cunningham's clever dance, "The Dutch
Girl.'"
