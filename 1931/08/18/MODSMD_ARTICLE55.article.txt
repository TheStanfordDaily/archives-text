# NEW PLUM DEVELOPED BY WILLIAM F. WIGHT
## 
### 
A new plum has been developed at
the experimental orchard undar the
direction of William F. Wight of the
U. S. Experimental Orchard on the
campus. The fruit is a cross between
a Methley and a Wickson plum and
was intended to have the shipping
qualities of a Japanese plum in addi
tion to a more pronounced flavor.
Though it has neither of the antici
pated qualities in any marked degree,
the new product, as yet unnamed, has
come into its own at the Richmond
Chase Cannery, at San Jose, where ex
periments are being conducted to per
fect a new dessert of frozen fruit. The
Wight plum is especially adaptable to
this use because of the texture and at
tractive deep red coloring of its pulp.
