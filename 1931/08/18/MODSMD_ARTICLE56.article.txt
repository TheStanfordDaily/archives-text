A Catalpa tree opposite Sequoia Hull
met its fate last week at the hands of
three campus youths.

The boys had been cruising about
the campus in an old cut-down model
T Ford when something snapped in
the steering gear causing Ford and
occupants to careen off the road The
Catalpa, to its own downfall, inter
cepted them in their mad flight. Eye
witnesses at the experimental orchard
nearby report that there were no cas
ualties beyond the felled tree.

It remains, however, that no one has
since noticed a cut-down Model T Ford
cruising about the campus.
