### 
! W. C. Werry, postmaster for Palo Alto
! and Stanford, announces that any per- j
j son who desires his mail forwarded at j
\ the end of the quarter must leave ad- J
j dresses at the post office. If this is not j
i done mail will collect in the boxes or j
J if addressed to general delivery, let
j ters will be returned to the senders or i
i to the dead letter office after 10 days. I
According to Werry the parcel post
! law which recently went into effect,
J increasing the weight limit of parcels
j to 70 pounds for all zones, has had lit -
j tie effect here as the majority of the
j larger sized packages sent and received j
| are the laundry boxes which, of course, i
i are much below the limit.
