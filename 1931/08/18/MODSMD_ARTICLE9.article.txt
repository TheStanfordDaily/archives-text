# PROFESSORS WATCH DAUGHTERS PADDLE IN SWIMMING MEET
## Aquatic Class Ends Season With Speed and Form, Races and Diving 
### 
"Who won that race? She's trying
to decide between us." Such were the
cries yesterday morning at Roble pool.

Eight young girls, daughters of uni
versity professors, skimmed in and out
of the water with shivering bodies but
eyes aglow with excitement.

They had been swimming in class all
summer, and yesterday's meet was a
climax to the season. Each girl was
keenly competing for championship
in all the eight events on the pro
gram. Miss Phyllis Linscott, their in
structor, remarked that as competition
was so close, particularly in the events
judged for the correctness of form, that
the contest was difficult to judge.
Ada Martin Takes Three Events
The 50-yard crawl was won by Ada
Martin, however, Ruth Martin, her sis
ter, and Dorothy Vernier, were close
on her heels. Ada also came out vic
torious in the 25-yard crawl and the
25-yard backstroke, while Dorothy
Vernier raced second in both these
events. Dorothy Boyer won third place
in the 25-yard crawl and Caroline
Shero took third in the backstroke race.
The best form in the crawl was
displayed by Dorothy Vernier, while
Mabel Pracy and Ada Martin were
awarded second and third respectively.
Ada Martin came back for first place
in the next event and backstroked in
excellent form. Dorothy Vernier was
second again and Beverly Pracy
claimed third place.
The diving events were particularly
hard to judge, Miss Linscott said, as
the girls were nearly on a par. First
place for surface diving was awarded
to Ruth Martin. Mabel Pracy and Dor
othy Vernier tied for second and Bev
erly Pracy was judged the third best.
Diving Excellent, Judging Close
Ruth Martin was chosen as the one
most skillfully executing the spring
board dives. She displayed exceptional
grace in all the events, which included
low board, swan, jackknife and run
ning front dives. Dorothy Vernier
placed second and Ada Martin, third.
The meet closed with a relay race
and the girls, divided into teams, joy
fully co-operated to defeat their op
ponents. The winning team, composed
of Dorothy Vernier, Dorothy Boyer,
Mabel Pracy, and Ruth Martin, de
feated Ada Martin, Beverly Pracy, Car
oline Shei'o, and Adrienne Shero.
