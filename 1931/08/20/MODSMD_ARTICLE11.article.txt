# ACTORS 10 REVIVE LURID MELODRAMA
## "Ten Nights in Bar-Room" to Be Shown August 31 
### 
"Villain, your career of landlord shall
be short, for here I swear, by the side
of my murdered child, you shall die
the death of a dog!" (Piano music.)
The curse of Joe Morgan, the drunk
ard, will rock the rafters of the Palo
Alto Community House Monday night,
August 31, when an all-star local cast
presents the famous old temperance
drama, "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room,"
by William W. Pratt.
First presented in the National Thea
ter, New York, in September, 1858,
"Ten Nights" has been playing ever
since. It boasts of a record of contin
uity like "Uncle Tom's Cabin," but in
recent years has been revived for
laughs, rather than tears. The Berke
ley Playhouse's production of "The
Drunkard, or the Fallen Saved" and
Christopher Morley's revival of "After
Dark," seen in San Francisco a year
ago, are othei examples.
Directed by A. Grove Day
However, the Community Players
will do "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room"
straight, for Director A. Grove Day,
feels that the melodrama has not lost
its crude dramatic values, in spite of
the ridiculously flowery speeches and
"asides," and the stilted or grossly ex
aggerated characters.
