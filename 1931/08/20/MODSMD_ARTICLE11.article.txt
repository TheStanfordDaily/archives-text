# ACTORS 10 REVIVE LURID MELODRAMA
## "Ten Nights in Bar-Room" to Be Shown August 31 
### 
"Villain, your career of landlord shall
be short, for here I swear, by the side
of my murdered child, you shall die
the death of a dog!" (Piano music.)
The curse of Joe Morgan, the drunk
ard, will rock the rafters of the Palo
Alto Community House Monday night,
August 31, when an all-star local cast
presents the famous old temperance
drama, "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room,"
by William W. Pratt.
First presented in the National Thea
ter, New York, in September, 1858,
"Ten Nights" has been playing ever
since. It boasts of a record of contin
uity like "Uncle Tom's Cabin," but in
recent years has been revived for
laughs, rather than tears. The Berke
ley Playhouse's production of "The
Drunkard, or the Fallen Saved" and
Christopher Morley's revival of "After
Dark," seen in San Francisco a year
ago, are othei examples.
Directed by A. Grove Day
However, the Community Players
will do "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room"
straight, for Director A. Grove Day,
feels that the melodrama has not lost
its crude dramatic values, in spite of
the ridiculously flowery speeches and
"asides," and the stilted or grossly ex
aggerated characters.

Mr. Romaine A. Grove Day
Day, playing Mr. Romaine, the mo

"The Importance of Being Earnest,"
Karel Capeks "R. U. R.," "Polly With
a Past" and " 'Ray 'Raj' Rover Boys"
and other Rams Head shows.
Mrs. Parks, the former Aileene Busks,
played the lead in "Polly With a Past,"
and was also in "Fashion." The latter
play, done by Gordon Davis in 1926,
was the last local revival of an out
dated play with the exception of "Mrs.
Bumpstead-Liegh," produced last year
by Harold Helvenston.
Mrs. Pabst, formerly Marjoria Allen,
played in "You and I," "Fashion,"
"Dear Brutus" and the Junior Opera

the Pendragcn Players in "What Price
Glory?" several years ago.
Simons Former Stanford Actor
Charles Simons was a Stanford actor
in "The Dover Road," Kaufman and
Connelly's "Dulcy," and " 'Rav, 'Ray
Rover Boys." Norris James, playing
his dissolute son, Frank, was Horatio
in Gordon Davis' production of "Ham
let" in modern dress, and played in
"Dover RoacV' and "Polly With a Past."
Mrs. Converse, formerly Peggy Ran
dall, had numerous leads at Stanford.
"Dulcy" was one, and Cinderella in
Barrie's "Kiss for Cinderella" was an
other. She was Ophelia in "Hamlet,"
and played in "You and I," "The Goose
Hangs High," "Fashion" and "Ace
High." She teamed with A1 Cass, for
mer Stanford comedian, in Big Game
Gaieties acts. Cass is also associated
with the Community Players, as is
Reidar Torjussen, another former Stan
ford player, though neither are in "Ten
Nights."
Rurncll Gould Plays Lead
Burnell Gould, known on the Stan
ford boards chiefly for Gaieties skits
and for leads in Elmer Rice's "Adding
Machine" and the Dunning-Abbott
melodrama, "Broadway," plays the
chief comedy role, a down-east hick,
opposite Mrs. Converse.
James Sandoe, a Stanford undergrad
uate, is cast as Willie Hammond, the
young hero who is led to Ihe wine cup
and the dice box by the villain, Green,
played by William Kilby, former Uni
versity of Washington actor. The long
suffering Mrs. Slade will be played by
Mrs. P. C. Deering, who has had con
cert stage experience.
Negotiations are understood to be un
der way to secure the Varsity Theater
for repeat performances of "Ten Nights
in a Bar-Room," since ihe Communily
House will not be nearly large enough,
Director D;iy believes, to house the
people who will want to sec this fa
mous temperance melodrama. Old
songs interpolated in "Ten Nights' v/ill
add to the mirth of ihe occasion.
Oklahoma is called the "Sooner
State" because of the settlers who
staked claims there before the terri
tory was officially opened by the gov
ernment.

The curse of Joe Morgan, the drunk
ard, will rock the rafters of the Palo
Alto Community House Monday night,
August 31, when an all-star local cast
presents the famous old temperance
drama, "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room,"
by William W. Pratt.
First presented in the National Thea
ter, New York, in September, 1858,
"Ten Nights" has been playing ever
since. It boasts of a record of contin
uity like "Uncle Tom's Cabin," but in
recent years has been revived for
laughs, rather than tears. The Berke
ley Playhouse's production of "The
Drunkard, or the Fallen Saved" and
Christopher Morley's revival of "After
Dark," seen in San Francisco a year
ago, are othei examples.
Directed by A. Grove Day
However, the Community Players
will do "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room"
straight, for Director A. Grove Day,
feels that the melodrama has not lost
its crude dramatic values, in spite of
the ridiculously flowery speeches and
"asides," and the stilted or grossly ex
aggerated characters.

Mr. Romaine A. Grove Day
Day, playing Mr. Romaine, the mo
ralizing philanthropist, the same role
he had in an Eastern revival, is only
one of a number of ex-Stanford stage
stars who are in the majority in the
experienced cast. Day was in "Mac
beth," James Barrie's '"Dear Brutus,"
and A. A. Milne's "The Dover Road"
at Stanford.
Parks a Ram's Head Man
Charles Parks, assisting Day in the
direction of '"Ten Nights" was in Philip
Barrie's "You and I," Oscar Wilde's
"The Importance of Being Earnest,"
Karel Capeks "R. U. R.," "Polly With
a Past" and " 'Ray 'Raj' Rover Boys"
and other Rams Head shows.
Mrs. Parks, the former Aileene Busks,
played the lead in "Polly With a Past,"
and was also in "Fashion." The latter
play, done by Gordon Davis in 1926,
was the last local revival of an out
dated play with the exception of "Mrs.
Bumpstead-Liegh," produced last year
by Harold Helvenston.
Mrs. Pabst, formerly Marjoria Allen,
played in "You and I," "Fashion,"
"Dear Brutus" and the Junior Opera
"Ace High." James Quinby, who will
play Little Mary's father in "Ten
Nights," last appeared in Palo Alto with
the Pendragcn Players in "What Price
Glory?" several years ago.
Simons Former Stanford Actor
Charles Simons was a Stanford actor
in "The Dover Road," Kaufman and
Connelly's "Dulcy," and " 'Rav, 'Ray
Rover Boys." Norris James, playing
his dissolute son, Frank, was Horatio
in Gordon Davis' production of "Ham
let" in modern dress, and played in
"Dover RoacV' and "Polly With a Past."
Mrs. Converse, formerly Peggy Ran
dall, had numerous leads at Stanford.
"Dulcy" was one, and Cinderella in
Barrie's "Kiss for Cinderella" was an
other. She was Ophelia in "Hamlet,"
and played in "You and I," "The Goose
Hangs High," "Fashion" and "Ace
High." She teamed with A1 Cass, for
mer Stanford comedian, in Big Game
Gaieties acts. Cass is also associated
with the Community Players, as is
Reidar Torjussen, another former Stan
ford player, though neither are in "Ten
Nights."
Rurncll Gould Plays Lead
Burnell Gould, known on the Stan
ford boards chiefly for Gaieties skits
and for leads in Elmer Rice's "Adding
Machine" and the Dunning-Abbott
melodrama, "Broadway," plays the
chief comedy role, a down-east hick,
opposite Mrs. Converse.
James Sandoe, a Stanford undergrad
uate, is cast as Willie Hammond, the
young hero who is led to Ihe wine cup
and the dice box by the villain, Green,
played by William Kilby, former Uni
versity of Washington actor. The long
suffering Mrs. Slade will be played by
Mrs. P. C. Deering, who has had con
cert stage experience.
Negotiations are understood to be un
der way to secure the Varsity Theater
for repeat performances of "Ten Nights
in a Bar-Room," since ihe Communily
House will not be nearly large enough,
Director D;iy believes, to house the
people who will want to sec this fa
mous temperance melodrama. Old
songs interpolated in "Ten Nights' v/ill
add to the mirth of ihe occasion.
Oklahoma is called the "Sooner
State" because of the settlers who
staked claims there before the terri
tory was officially opened by the gov
ernment.

Mr. Romaine A. Grove Day
Day, playing Mr. Romaine, the mo
ralizing philanthropist, the same role
he had in an Eastern revival, is only
one of a number of ex-Stanford stage
stars who are in the majority in the
experienced cast. Day was in "Mac
beth," James Barrie's '"Dear Brutus,"
and A. A. Milne's "The Dover Road"
at Stanford.
Parks a Ram's Head Man
Charles Parks, assisting Day in the

Barrie's "You and I," Oscar Wilde's
"The Importance of Being Earnest,"
Karel Capeks "R. U. R.," "Polly With
a Past" and " 'Ray 'Raj' Rover Boys"
and other Rams Head shows.
Mrs. Parks, the former Aileene Busks,
played the lead in "Polly With a Past,"
and was also in "Fashion." The latter
play, done by Gordon Davis in 1926,
was the last local revival of an out
dated play with the exception of "Mrs.
Bumpstead-Liegh," produced last year
by Harold Helvenston.
Mrs. Pabst, formerly Marjoria Allen,
played in "You and I," "Fashion,"
"Dear Brutus" and the Junior Opera
"Ace High." James Quinby, who will
play Little Mary's father in "Ten
Nights," last appeared in Palo Alto with
the Pendragcn Players in "What Price
Glory?" several years ago.
Simons Former Stanford Actor
Charles Simons was a Stanford actor
in "The Dover Road," Kaufman and
Connelly's "Dulcy," and " 'Rav, 'Ray
Rover Boys." Norris James, playing
his dissolute son, Frank, was Horatio
in Gordon Davis' production of "Ham
let" in modern dress, and played in
"Dover RoacV' and "Polly With a Past."
Mrs. Converse, formerly Peggy Ran
dall, had numerous leads at Stanford.
"Dulcy" was one, and Cinderella in
Barrie's "Kiss for Cinderella" was an
other. She was Ophelia in "Hamlet,"
and played in "You and I," "The Goose
Hangs High," "Fashion" and "Ace
High." She teamed with A1 Cass, for
mer Stanford comedian, in Big Game
Gaieties acts. Cass is also associated

The curse of Joe Morgan, the drunk
ard, will rock the rafters of the Palo
Alto Community House Monday night,
August 31, when an all-star local cast
presents the famous old temperance
drama, "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room,"
by William W. Pratt.
First presented in the National Thea
ter, New York, in September, 1858,
"Ten Nights" has been playing ever
since. It boasts of a record of contin
uity like "Uncle Tom's Cabin," but in
recent years has been revived for
laughs, rather than tears. The Berke
ley Playhouse's production of "The
Drunkard, or the Fallen Saved" and
Christopher Morley's revival of "After
Dark," seen in San Francisco a year
ago, are othei examples.
Directed by A. Grove Day
However, the Community Players
will do "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room"
straight, for Director A. Grove Day,
feels that the melodrama has not lost
its crude dramatic values, in spite of
the ridiculously flowery speeches and
"asides," and the stilted or grossly ex
aggerated characters.
