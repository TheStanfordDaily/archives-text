"The chief attraction to most stu
dents in the cafeteria was apparently
the fresh vegetables," said Miss Chrib
tine Ricker, director of dining halls, ex
plaining the change, "and we will add
these to the Cellar menu, which oth
erwise has been very much the same
in meeting students' desire for light
lunches and breakfasts.
"Evidently," said Miss Ricker, "the
education majors were the heaviest pa
trons of the cafeteria, because since
the close of their short term the num
ber of patrons of the cafeteria has
dropped to about twenty for breakfast
and dinner. We feel that we can care
for those few satisfactorily by serving
them in the Cellar for the remainder
of the quarter."
