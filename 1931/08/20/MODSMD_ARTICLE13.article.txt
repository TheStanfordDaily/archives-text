# WORLD MENACE SEEN IN SOVIET RAILWAY CLASH
## Prince Says Russian Failure Would Prove Serious Peace Detriment 
### 
"Unless Russia wins out in the con
troversy over the Chinese Eastern
Railway, the question will constitute
a permanent menace to the peace of
the world." This was the sentiment ex
pressed Tuesday night in the Little
Theatre, when Prince A. Lobanov-
Rotovsky of the University of Califor
nia, at Los Angeles, spoke upon the
Far Eastern policy of the Soviet gov
ernment.
Diplomatic relations with the East
have been tinged with nationalism, al
though Soviet idealism is supposedly
the guiding factor. The new Russia is
beset with the same problems as those
encountered by Czardom, he said.
Lenin Pictured as Strategist
Lenin, Soviet leader, was illuminat
ingly pictured by the lecturer as an
Eastern strategist, having taken the
side of Japan in the Russo-Japanese
War, and the side of the Boxers in the
Chinese rebellion.
According to Rostovsky, Soviet di
plomacy is frankly conservative, since
the major problem is the preservation
of interests gained under the Czar. The
new government has annulled all trea
ties, pacts, and agreements which im
pose annoying obligations upon the
Chinese and Mongolians. As a result,
Mongolia favors Russian policies, but
only insofar as they contribute to the
solution of practical problems.
Soviet Activity Moves Eastward
With the Black Sea a closed area to
Russian exports, and with the Baltic
region separated from Russia following
the World War, the only course open to
the Soviet activity lies eastward. The
Pacific area naturally draws this ac
tivity, with the railway fundamentally
important. Thirty-six thousand troops
guard the line, the prince explained.
"A great empire has been quietly ac
quired in the Far East," said the
speaker, "without so much as passing
notice from the outside world. Mon
golia and Siberia, long dormant, will
now bear careful watching."
Changes Due to Railway
Manchuria, formerly the home of
2,000 nomads, now contains 30 million
Chinese because of the economic op
portunities offered by the railway,
while Mongolia was proclaimed a Red
Republic in August, 1924, through a
clever bit of Soviet strategy.
In a secret message to the Soviet
government Sun Yat Sen, Chinese rev
olutionary and patriot said: "I hope
the day will come when Russia will
find in China a power and an ally."
Japan, China, and Russia are arrang
ing the factors in a new empire and
the outcome is as dubious as it is im
portant, Rostovsky concluded.
