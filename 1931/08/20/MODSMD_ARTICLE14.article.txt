# SEARCHLIGHT ROUTES STARTLED ROBBER IN KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE
## 
### 
Combining the petrifying qualities of
j a powerful searchlight with a threaten
j ing shout of vengeance, Peter Jurs, stu
i dent, successfully routed a campus
j burglar from the Kappa Alpha house
j early Tuesday morning.
Jurs, who was retiring at a lata hour,
j heard a slight noise at the rear of the
fraternity house. Realizing the hour
and the apparent foolishness of any
one who was acquainted with the house
i entered in the rear, Jurs decided to
I investigate.
Armed with a large searchlight and
! a sleepy determination he stealthily
crept toward the sound. Suddenly he
whipped the light on, its beam dis
closing a most surprised marauder. The
burglar stared at Jurs; Jurs stared at
i the burglar. Then Jurs played his ace;
j a bloodcurdling Indian Yell ripped
! through the air, and practically on its
; heels ripped the ill-advised Mr. Burg
lar. He ripped a ten flat out of the
j house and down the alley.
This is believed to be the same man
j who robbed the Sigma Chi House of
1 some $200 worth of clothes and val
j uables earlier in the quarter. No de
| scription was obtained.
