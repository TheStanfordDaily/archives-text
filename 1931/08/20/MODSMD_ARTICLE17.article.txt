# GREGOIRE DEPICTS BYZANTINE COURT
## Prestige of Ruler Was Main Strength of Empire 
### 
The importance of the, imperial idea
in Byzantine history and civilization
was stressed by Professor Henri Greg
oire in his lecture on the Byzantine
court yesterday afternoon. This was
the next to the last of his Wednesday
afternoon talks on the general topic
of Byzantine culture and civilization.
Professor Gregoire said that the per
son of the emperor was sacred both
because he was the successor of the
Roman emperoi's and because of the
Christian apostles. The emperor's pres
tige was throughout ten centurics of
Byzantine history the main strength
of Byzantium itself, and the abode of
the emperor, the imperial palace of
Constantinople, holds a central posi
tion in the interest of scholars con
cerned with Byzantium.
Professor Gregoire described briefly
the many buildings which composed
the imperial city and of which only a
few walls are now extant. He evoked
some episodes of the imperial cere
monies, and dwelt at some length upon
the most detailed account we have of a
western embassy to the Byzantine
court, the story of Liudprand of Cre
mona, who was sent to the court of
Nicophorus by the German emperor
Otto I. Professor Gregoire concluded
by describing the last ceremony of an
emperor's life, his burial in the church
of the Holy Apostle.
The last lecture of this series will
be given next Wednesday afternoon
at 4:15 in the Little Theatre. Professor
Gregoire will talk in French on the
Byzantine monuments in Greece, espe
cially those of the so-called Byzantine
renaissance in Thessalonica and Mis
tra, and will supplement the lecture
with lantern slides. This lecture will
include reminiscences of Professor
Gregoire's last trip to Greece, in Oc
tober of 1930, when he attended the
Congress of Byzantinists held there.
