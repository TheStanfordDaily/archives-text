## 
### 
gK'C KRENZ, who was graduated from Stanford "with distinction" IJKJO
and was internationally known as a world's champion athlete, lost his life
Tuesday afternoon while swimming in Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe, where lie was
spending his vacation.
lie had started to swim ashore from a- boat, when he suddenly called f«-r
help and sank before aid could reach him. More than an hour passed before
his body was recovered from the bottom of the lake, and long efforts to re
suscitate him were futile. Physicians expressed the opinion that Krenz suc
cumbed to a heart attack.
Krcnz, who made a high record as a student of accounting at Stanford, h;ul

<s»been working as an accountant in San
Francisco since graduating and was
gaining recognition in his work there.
As an undergraduate at Stanford
Krenz, while generally known as an
outstanding athlete and captain of the
track team in his senior year, was
known to his friends as a quiet man of
earnest convictions and keen mental
ability, which won for him a high rating
in his studies.
An Athlete—and a Man
Coach R. L. Templeton, who through
close association with Krenz in his
! training as an athlete came to know
j him as intimately as anybody at Stan
j ford, says that "the kind of man Krenz
was" overshadowed his prowess as an
athlete. Templeton ascribes Krenz's
reaching the point where he was able
to better world's records that had stood
for years more to his mental than to
his physical make-up.
Templeton cites as evidence of this
the fact that after Krenz came to Stan
ford with a good record as a high
school weight man, he studied out and
adopted an entirely new form for him
self in the discus throw, and with that
style, which was scientifically devised,
differing fi'om what previous champions
had used, he surpassed the best that
had ever been done in history before,
and was working at the time of his
death to improve it still further for
the Olympic Games next year.
Wanted to Know "Why"
Templeton tells, also, of Krenz's re
fusal to accept rules merely because
they were given to him by an authority.
"When Eric came to Stanford and I
started to lay down the set rules of
form for his use," Templeton says, "I
found a man whose mind was keen and
rebelled against set rules without ex
planation. When I told him to do a
thing in a certain way, he wanted to
know why, and I had to prove that I
was right before he would accept my
word for it.
"Sometimes we went round and
round for hours on some little minor
point course. For this man, even as a
college youth, attacked everything he
went into with the determination that
he would perfect himself to the last
degree of his possibilities.
"Through the fall and winter quar
ters he put in his two hours a day
with the same intensity that he worked
I during the middle of the season.
"He hit his studies the same way
and was outstandingly brilliant in them,
as he was on the athletic field."
Commenting on Krenz's achievements
as a competitive athlete, Templeton
says he recalls with particular pleasure
the 1928 I.C.AA.A.A. meet when he
and Harlow Rothert, both unknown
Stanford sophomores, both put the shot
beyond the fifty-foot mark, within a
fraction of an inch of each other, win
ning first and second and beginning a

friendly rivalry that lasted through
their college careers.
World's Record in Discus
Krenz was the first man in history
to throw the discus more than 160 feet.
He established a world's record of IG3
feet 8% inches, and it was regarded j
as possible that next year he would I
reach 170 feet.
At Stanford Krenz belonged to the j
Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes, t
Scalpers, and the Breakers. He was a
member of the honor code committee ,
in his junior year and a sponsor and j
a member of the Board of Athletic j
Control in his senior year.
Krenz's home was in Stockton and j
the body has been taken there. The 1
time of his funeral has not been an- j
nounced. ' I

Commenting on Krenz's achievements
as a competitive athlete, Templeton
says he recalls with particular pleasure
the 1928 I.C.AA.A.A. meet when he
and Harlow Rothert, both unknown
Stanford sophomores, both put the shot
beyond the fifty-foot mark, within a
fraction of an inch of each other, win
ning first and second and beginning a

friendly rivalry that lasted through
their college careers.
World's Record in Discus
Krenz was the first man in history
to throw the discus more than 160 feet.
He established a world's record of IG3
feet 8% inches, and it was regarded j
as possible that next year he would I
reach 170 feet.
At Stanford Krenz belonged to the j
Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes, t
Scalpers, and the Breakers. He was a
member of the honor code committee ,
in his junior year and a sponsor and j
a member of the Board of Athletic j
Control in his senior year.

As an undergraduate at Stanford
Krenz, while generally known as an
outstanding athlete and captain of the
track team in his senior year, was
known to his friends as a quiet man of
earnest convictions and keen mental
ability, which won for him a high rating
in his studies.
An Athlete—and a Man
Coach R. L. Templeton, who through
close association with Krenz in his
! training as an athlete came to know
j him as intimately as anybody at Stan
j ford, says that "the kind of man Krenz
was" overshadowed his prowess as an
athlete. Templeton ascribes Krenz's
reaching the point where he was able
to better world's records that had stood
for years more to his mental than to
his physical make-up.
Templeton cites as evidence of this
the fact that after Krenz came to Stan
ford with a good record as a high
school weight man, he studied out and
adopted an entirely new form for him
self in the discus throw, and with that
style, which was scientifically devised,
differing fi'om what previous champions
had used, he surpassed the best that
had ever been done in history before,
and was working at the time of his
death to improve it still further for
the Olympic Games next year.
Wanted to Know "Why"
Templeton tells, also, of Krenz's re
fusal to accept rules merely because
they were given to him by an authority.
"When Eric came to Stanford and I
started to lay down the set rules of
form for his use," Templeton says, "I
found a man whose mind was keen and
rebelled against set rules without ex
planation. When I told him to do a
thing in a certain way, he wanted to
know why, and I had to prove that I
was right before he would accept my
