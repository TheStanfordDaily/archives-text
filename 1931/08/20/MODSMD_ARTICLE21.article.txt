# STANFORD PLAYERS TAKE FIVE PARTS IN CARMEL DRAMA HIT
## 
### 
Five Stanford people, one of them
in the leading part, helped to make a
success of the "Beggar on Horseback,"
which was presented at the Golden
Bough Theatre in Carmel for six per
formances during the past two week
ends.
Mrs. E. C. Converse, nee Velma Mar
jory Randall, '27, who was active in
Stanford dramatics during her col
lege career, took the leading part. This
role was to have been played by Gene
vieve Goddard, ex-'33, who left sud
denly for the East, where she was mar
ried Monday. Other parts in the "Beg
gar on Hox-scback" were taken by Pro
fessor Henry D. Gray of the English
department, and by Katheryn Peck, : 2G.
Maxine Cushing, '30, was in charge of
the lights, and Ruth Bowen, who at
tended Stanford in 1926-27, managed
the properties.
That the play was a success can be
gathered from the box-office report of
a sell-out for every performance, with
even standing room being taken.
