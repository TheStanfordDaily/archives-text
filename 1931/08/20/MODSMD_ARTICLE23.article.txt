# ERIC KRENZ, STANFORD MAX
## 
### 
The world knew Eric Krenz as a mighty man who was able
to throw a sixteen-pound shot and the old Greek discus farther
than any man had ever thrown them before—as a world's
champion athlete.
Stanford knew him as a quiet gentleman, with ideas of his
own and high standards of his own. World champion though
he was, athletics were held in their proper place by him; he
did not overestimate their significance any more than he under
estimated the pleasure he got out of excelling the best in tlie
world in feats of disciplined strength.
In a company Krenz was usually the most silent of the
group, because he preferred not to talk unless he had something
that seemed worth saying. When he did speak, his words
showed the result of thinking. Sometimes his own ideas ran
pretty violently counter to those held by others and then, again,
he usually kept silence unless it seemed to liini that there was
enough point in expressing his own convictions; he did not care
to enter discussion unless something was to come out of it.
lie had, of course, a line body, but that alone would not have
made him the athlete he was. His championship he gained by
his own independent mind, once more. He studied himself and
his objective and he worked out for himself and then, pains
takingly and long, pfacticed the methods lie had devised until
the new style became smooth and natural—and won him cham
pionships.
In his studies lie was the same patient, thorough, thoughtful
workman. As a result lie gained scholastic honors as well as
athletic. What he learned at Stanford in preparation for his
life work he was putting into practice in business—with the
same result of perfected success through care in thinking and
in working. He was progressing in his business as an account
ant as lie had in the other activities of his life. He liked the
work of an accountant because it was precise and called for
thoroughness. His choice of a life,-work was characteristic. Out
of his training as an accountant he looked forward to greater
things, and those who knew him best know that lie would
have won.
