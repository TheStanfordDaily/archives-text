If the building of new hotels is any indication, Mexico ex
pects to enter soon upon a campaign to attract tourists farther

Soon every train to Mexico's interior will be tilled with travelers
who would not dare to risk spending a night in one ot the typi
cal present Mexican hostelries but who would have no com
punctions against living for a week or so in one ol the modern
hotels which are being erected. At least so hopes Mexico.
Rut before timid tourists can be lured more than a day s
journey from the American border, they must be provided with
the assurance that no revolution with its attendant disturbance
will break out while thev are there. And to give that assurance
is, l'or Mexico, harder than building new hotels.
