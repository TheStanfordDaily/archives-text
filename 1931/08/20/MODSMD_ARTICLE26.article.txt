# GOODBYE; WE'VE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME
## 
### 
The time lias come for the Daily to say goodbye to the
Stanford people who have received il into their homes twice a
week since the quarter opened and to make the customary
polite acknowledgments.
Goodbye; you have given us such a good time.
And the Daily makes this acknowledgment not at all as a
perfunctory requirement, but in all sincerity. We of the stall
have enjoyed tremendously the opportunity to meet all the rest
of von twice a week and gossip with you about what is going on
that interests us all.
And for some of the nice things that some of you have been
kind enough to say about the Daily this summer the Daily
expresses its heartfelt appreciation. For the scattering of se
vere criticisms that have also been expressed the Daily is like
wise appreciative; only friends are grieved if one goes wrong.
Il has been a really line summer of accomplishments that
the Daily has been privileged to talk with its readers about
during these weeks. We may all congratulate each other as we
say goodbye.
Hut lest the Daily slip into the awkward fault of standing
over-long on the doorstep saying goodbye while the host and
hostess fidget and wonder how soon they will be released in
order to get al a job they must do that evening, let us stop.
Your job, as well as that of the 1 )aily's stall members, is final
examinations. And so, finally, goodbye and goodluck.
