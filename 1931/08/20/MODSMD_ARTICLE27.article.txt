### 
Dr. Kurt F. Reinhart, professor of
Germanic Languages, in an interview
today said that at the present time there
is a great demand for teachers of Ger
man. During the war German was not
taught in America and there are lew
younger men to succeed the older
teachers who are resigning.
"The Germanic Language Depart
ment at Stanford has this year reached
the point where there are more candi
dates for Doctor of Philosophy than at
any time in the history of the Univer
sity," says Dr Reinhart. "There '.s a
steady growth, the number of under
graduate majors is increasing and many
graduates are returning to take higher
degrees. This is true in nearly all the
universities all over the United Stales.
"The teaching of German has spread
rapidly to the high schools as well. In
most of the secondary schools in the
larger towns and cities the language
has been reintroduced. This is an im
portant fact for a very large registra
tion in upper division classes in the
universities is impossible until German
is restored to an equal footing with
French and Spanish in preparatory
schools."
