SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL—At The
Geary, San Francisco.
Strange as it may seem, Walter Gil
bert, in the lole of Charles, the happy
go-lucky young sport of Sheridan's old
classic, scampered away with the show
in a most respectable style, leaving a
small burden on the noticeably weary,
but exquisite, featured star, Ethel Bar
rymore.
Not that Miss Barrymore is "out"—
she had a well-nigh perfect scenc in
the third act in the clever dialogue be
tween herself (Lady Teazle) and her
aged husband, (Sir Peter Teazle) —but
rather that Gilbert overshadowed her
with a superior enthusiasm.
Of the others in the cast, McKay
Morris, as the hypocritical Joseph Sur
face, conveyed a fine characterization
from his first line on; Beatrice Terry,
as Lady Sneerwell, the mistress of the
"school for scandal"' was delightfully
"snippy"; and Charles Croker-King
and Harry Plimmer, playing Sir Peter
Teazle and Sir Oliver Surface respec
tively, presented high grade comedy.
Rowan's "Snake" was refreshing.
