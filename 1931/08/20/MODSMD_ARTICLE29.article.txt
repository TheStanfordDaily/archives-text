### 
In answer to the question whether or i
not there is any truth in the claim that j
the introduction and use of the radio I
has reduced the importance of public j
speaking. James Gordon Emerson, as- :
sociate professor of English and public j
speaking, replied that the modern j
growth of the service clubs would in
dicate that public speaking is just as
important as ever.
The fact that the United States Army
requires its young officers to study pub- j
lie speaking and that Woodrow Wilson
personally delivered his messages to
Congress, were also given to show that
the importance of public speaking is
not decreasing.
The radio has influenced the effec
tiveness of speaking, believes Profes- i
sor Emerson. He pointed out that
when speaking over the radio, Senator
Borah, who is a fine public orator,
loses much of his effectiveness, while
on the other hand President Hoover
speaks exceptionally well over the ra
dio, but is not as effective when mak
ing a public address.
The greatest advancements, believes
Professor Emerson, made in the study
of speech during recent yeal's is the
knowledge of how to cure stuttering,
stammering, and other speech defects.
