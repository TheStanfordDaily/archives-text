## 
### 
"Casey" Kazanjian, former Stanford
athlete, wrestled Ad Santel, one of rhe
most wily veterans in the mat game, j
to a draw in the semi-windup fray at J
the Dreamland Auditorium last Mon
day night.
Kazanjian's showing was impressive
and his draw with Santel, previously
light-heavyweight chajnpion of the
world, and claimed by numerous sport
followers as second only to Ed ''Stran
gler" Lewis in experience, ring strategy
and cleverness, entitles him to be rated
among the leading contenders in the
new crop of young heavyweights.
