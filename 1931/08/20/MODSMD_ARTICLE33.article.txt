# HELVENSTON REVIEWS DRAMATICS SEASON SUCCESS; LARGE STUDENT ACTIVITY NOTED
## 
### 
The 1931 summer quarter dramatics '
season presented at Stanford two emi
nent playwrights whose work has never
before been produced on the campus
boards, gave about one-ninth of the j
whole student body an opportunity to
participate in stage production, and
paid for itself financially, making no
call on Associated Students funds for
support.
This is a summary as gleaned from
a conversation with Harold Helvenston,
director of dramatics of the University.
Moreover the summer's record is simi
lar in all these aspects to the achieve
ments of other quarters in recent years,
and it represents goals for which those
in charge have been aiming—to pro
duce worthwhile productions, and as
frequently as possible the work cf dra
matists whose work is unfamiliar on
the Coast, to secure general student
participation in these productions and
to be as little drain as pcfssible on the
general funds, which are called on to
support so many activities.
Stover Saves Money
"Two playwrights of the highest rank
never before represented on the Stan
lord stage were produced this sum-"
mer," said Helvenston, "Nikolai Gogol,
with 'The Inspector General,' and Eu
gene O'Neill, with 'The Hairy Ape,' in
each case one of their best, represen
tative dramas.
"The two productions were difficult
and well handled from the technical
angle, nine scenes being required.
Harry Stover, in charge of the tech
nical matters, works hard not only to
build appropriate and attractive sets
but to keep the cost down. His de
vices to save money are worthy of
almost as much admiration as his skill
in achieving notable effects. About 40
people were used backstage.
"Between 75 and 80 actors had larger
or smaller parts. That makes a total
very close to one-ninth of the whole
number of registered students who
participated actively in dramatics."
Praises One-Act Program
Helvenston spoke*highly of the bill
of one-act plays given on August 14.
"This bill," declared, "was acclaimed
one of the best ever given. A drama,
a fantasy, and a comedy made up a
program which employed twelve actors.
The entire induction, acting, direct
ing, and settings, was the work of stu
dents under faculty supervision.
"This particular program," Helven
ston remarked, "is designed to allow
the students of production classes a
complete chance at self-expression. It
also was a success financially."
Speaking of dramatics at Stanford in
general, Helvenston said: "The Stan
ford dramatics production department
really has two general ideals constant
ly in mind. The first is that of pre
senting the finest plays of top play
wrights and giving a variety of plays
over a period of the college year, with

! the summer season more or less de
i voted to the staging of the experi
mental or luxury type of play. The
j second objective, which is constantly
j kept in mind, is that of becoming self- j
! supporting — financially independent
j and not a burden upon the Associated
! Students or any other organization.
Have Surplus in Bank
I "During the last year the financial i
affairs of the Stanford Dramatic Coun
| cil have been so conducted as to leave
a surplus in the bank."
i Helvenston ran over the names of I
! authors who have been represented j
at Stanford during the last ten yec rs ,
to support his contention that many i
otherwise unavailable have been seen
I here. Among them are, beside Gogol
land O'Neill, George Abbott, Philip l
I Dunning, Maurice Browne, Robert
! Nichols, Carlo Goldini, George Kauf
l man, and Edna Ferber.
I "Arid," Helvenston concluded, "Stan
! ford led other universities in the pro
j duction of at least live of these."
Despite economic conditions, infant
, mortality in Illinois for 1930 is the
lowest ever.

A high school in Denver has suc
cessfully conducted home economics
classes for boys for eight years.

Stover Saves Money
"Two playwrights of the highest rank
never before represented on the Stan
lord stage were produced this sum-"
mer," said Helvenston, "Nikolai Gogol,
with 'The Inspector General,' and Eu
gene O'Neill, with 'The Hairy Ape,' in
each case one of their best, represen
tative dramas.
"The two productions were difficult
and well handled from the technical
angle, nine scenes being required.
Harry Stover, in charge of the tech
nical matters, works hard not only to
build appropriate and attractive sets
but to keep the cost down. His de
vices to save money are worthy of
almost as much admiration as his skill
in achieving notable effects. About 40
people were used backstage.
"Between 75 and 80 actors had larger
or smaller parts. That makes a total
very close to one-ninth of the whole
number of registered students who
participated actively in dramatics."
Praises One-Act Program
Helvenston spoke*highly of the bill
of one-act plays given on August 14.
"This bill," declared, "was acclaimed
one of the best ever given. A drama,
a fantasy, and a comedy made up a
program which employed twelve actors.
The entire induction, acting, direct
ing, and settings, was the work of stu
dents under faculty supervision.
"This particular program," Helven
ston remarked, "is designed to allow
the students of production classes a
complete chance at self-expression. It
also was a success financially."
Speaking of dramatics at Stanford in
general, Helvenston said: "The Stan
