# TRADITION OF COUTTS RECALLS MYSTERY OF PRE-STANFORD DAYS
## Campus Still Shows Many Signs of Frenchman's Activities 
### 
Much has been written about Stan
ford's most famous "tradition," the
mysterious Frenchman, who owned
part of what is now the campus, long i
before the University was thought of.
Most of what has been written was
untrue, including the assertion that he
was a defaulter and was later run down
in his hiding place here and taken j
back to France to stand trial. But there
was such a Frenchman, Peter Coutts,
and he left mementoes of his stay that !
still stand. As a matter of fact, he was
a political exile from France, a per
fectly reputable man, and he returned
to France in good standing when there
was a change in his political fortunes.
Of the actual remains and reminders
of Peter Coutts there are now indica
tions of an extensive water system that i
he planned, including the romantic
"Frenchman's Tower" out on the Page
Mill road; trees planted on hill tops
and along now vanished roads, de
signed to make his part of the Santa
Clara Valley resemble his beloved
France; the brick building near the ,
College Terrace entrance to + he cam
pus, where he housed a valuable book
collection and had his study; and near !
that spot a cottage, now enlarged,
which he occupied while he planned
a more stately residence on one of his
pine covered hilltops.
Coutts Planted Trees
At the end of Fraternity Row and
on the way to Mayfield is a cut on the
right hand side of the road called
Frenchman's Cut that opens into a lit
tle valley and the site of Frenchman's
Lake. The lake was filled-in years ago
because it was a breeding ground for
mosquitoes. The valley is very flat
and surrounded by low rolling hills.
Most of the pine and spruce trees that
are growing along the crest of the hills
were set out by Coutts to serve as a
windbreak. The artificial lake was sit
uated in the middle of the canyon. It
was walled in with bricks and masonry, 1
including a bit of picturesque "ruin,"
and in the center was an aVtificial island
planted with tall grasses. Oft' to *he far
end a little stone bridge of French de
sign flanked by a double row of pop
lars still stands.
Stanford Buys From Coutts
Before the establishment of the Uni
versity, Senator Stanford bought 1,400
acres of the land comprising the pres
ent campus from Coutts for $114,000.
Coutts had built a large number of
stables, for he kept a number cf line
blooded cattle. His special delights i
were Ayrshire and Holstcin cows. One
of his stables still stands. When Sen
ator Stanford took over the place he j
located his running farm in the cattle i
barns for a while. His trotting farm
was situated where the golf course
now is.
Peter Coutts is said to have been a
handsome man with snow white hair, j
strong features, and dark eyes.
When Dr. Jordan first came to Stan- j
ford he lived in Escondite Cottage |
which had formerly belonged to
Coutts. The name Escondite means j
concealment ,and was given to the cot
tage by Dr. Jordan.

was such a Frenchman, Peter Coutts,
and he left mementoes of his stay that !
still stand. As a matter of fact, he was
a political exile from France, a per
fectly reputable man, and he returned
to France in good standing when there
was a change in his political fortunes.
Of the actual remains and reminders
of Peter Coutts there are now indica
tions of an extensive water system that i
he planned, including the romantic
"Frenchman's Tower" out on the Page
Mill road; trees planted on hill tops
and along now vanished roads, de
signed to make his part of the Santa
Clara Valley resemble his beloved
France; the brick building near the ,
College Terrace entrance to + he cam
pus, where he housed a valuable book
collection and had his study; and near !
that spot a cottage, now enlarged,
which he occupied while he planned
a more stately residence on one of his
pine covered hilltops.
Coutts Planted Trees
At the end of Fraternity Row and
on the way to Mayfield is a cut on the
right hand side of the road called
Frenchman's Cut that opens into a lit
tle valley and the site of Frenchman's
Lake. The lake was filled-in years ago
because it was a breeding ground for
mosquitoes. The valley is very flat
and surrounded by low rolling hills.
Most of the pine and spruce trees that
are growing along the crest of the hills
were set out by Coutts to serve as a
windbreak. The artificial lake was sit
uated in the middle of the canyon. It
was walled in with bricks and masonry, 1
including a bit of picturesque "ruin,"
and in the center was an aVtificial island
planted with tall grasses. Oft' to *he far
end a little stone bridge of French de
sign flanked by a double row of pop
lars still stands.
Stanford Buys From Coutts
Before the establishment of the Uni
versity, Senator Stanford bought 1,400
acres of the land comprising the pres
ent campus from Coutts for $114,000.
Coutts had built a large number of
stables, for he kept a number cf line
blooded cattle. His special delights i
were Ayrshire and Holstcin cows. One
of his stables still stands. When Sen
ator Stanford took over the place he j
located his running farm in the cattle i
barns for a while. His trotting farm
was situated where the golf course
now is.
Peter Coutts is said to have been a
handsome man with snow white hair, j
strong features, and dark eyes.
When Dr. Jordan first came to Stan- j
ford he lived in Escondite Cottage |
which had formerly belonged to
Coutts. The name Escondite means j
concealment ,and was given to the cot
tage by Dr. Jordan.
Much has been written about Stan
ford's most famous "tradition," the
mysterious Frenchman, who owned
part of what is now the campus, long i
before the University was thought of.
Most of what has been written was
untrue, including the assertion that he
was a defaulter and was later run down
in his hiding place here and taken j
back to France to stand trial. But there
