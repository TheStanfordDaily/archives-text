# COMMISSIONER SAYS ALASKAN EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS SUPERIOR

Are Alaskan teachcrs better trained
than those of California? Lester D.
Henderson, for twelve years commis
sioner of education in Alaska, and now
doing graduate work in Stanford's
school of education, believes so. He re
veals some interesting facts concerning
the far north country.
"Territorial law provides that teach
ers in the elements, v* schools shall have
two years prepaid don beyond high
school,"' declared Henderson. This
would correspond to a normal school
training in the United States.
"Although California's proper record
is two years in excess of this," he con
tinued, "Alaskan teachers are actually
better trained than those of California.
Education there is far past the experi
mental stage. Alask.i College, founded
in 1922, now has a student, body of 200
and sends out exceptionally well qual
ified instructors."
Many Alaskans Go to College
That twelve Alaskan high schools
send at least 60 per cent of their grad
uates on to institutions of higher learn
ing, is the former commissioner's opin
ion. Nine of the preparatory schools
are accredited by the University of
Washington, while three are members
of the Northern Association of Higher
and Secondary Schools.
The present school system, organized
in 1927, is backed by the Territorial
government. Small schools are financed
by the government, which also gives
70 to 80 per cent of the funds needed
by the more populated communities,
said Henderson.
Switching from educational facilities
to the weather, Henderson claimed that
twenty-four hours of daylight holds
much of comfort and pleasure.
Seldom Experience Zero Weather
"The Pacific Ocean area seldom ex
periences zero temperature in winter,
while in summer, plants flourish in
semi-tropical abundance. The Japan
current is to blame for this upset of
what some folks, who are long on im
agination, but short on geography, be
lieve.
"Even at Point Barrow, famous as the
stopping place of the Lindberghs, and
the starting place of the Wilkins expe
dition, midsummer days are mild and
pleasant. In fact the winter climate is
milder than in some parts of Califor
nia."
