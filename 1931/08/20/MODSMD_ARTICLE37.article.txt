# TEARFUL DEPARTURE IMMINENT AS BETAS DISPERSE MENAGERIE
## Pet Nanny Goat Will Now Revert to Rightful Proprietor 
### 
! . "Even the best of friends must
part," as the Beta menagerie is soon to
discover when the summer ends.
Soab, Persian-educated parrot, dis
appeared a few days ago, perhaps to
avoid the sorrow of last-minute part
ings, perhaps to look for the North
1 Pole; the thing is, he is gone.
Cleo, the nanny-goat who was given
to Norman McLeod by the gardner,
will be returned to her owner. She is
growing up, and no longer must be fed
by hand, but eats grass in the garden
like any adult goat.
Airedale "Owns" Campus
Pal, old Airedale, who all but owns
the campus, if establishing a perma
nent residence is any proof of owner
ship, will have no difficult time in find
| ing a home for the remainder of tne
I summer. His confrere, Sonny, a Ger
man police dog, will go home with
his master, George Cristal. So great
is the appeal of a small kitten that
Gloria will not want for a home.
White Rat "Spirited Away"
For one day a white rat had a place
in the menagerie, but somehow or oih
er he was spirited away. A mock trial
was held in an attempt to discover, ar
rest, and convict the criminal, but the
one suspect had not enough evidence
against him to be convicted, and the
mystery of the disappearance remains
unsolved.
"Even the best of friends must part
. . ."—who said that?
At least we know that Shakespeare
j was responsible for the equally appro
| priate "Parting is such sweet sorrow
I . . . ." But psychologists and poets say
I that animals know no grief .... But
{ Betas do, and even parrots and white
rats can win one's affection.
