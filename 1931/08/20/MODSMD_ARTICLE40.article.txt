# BRITISH VISITOR SEES STUDENT ENTHUSIASM IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS
## University of London Student "Wonders" at U. S. College Customs 
### 
That the American warrants great
admiration for his work, and for hav
ing the courage of his convictions is
the opinion of William James, student
in the University of London who has
been on the campus for a fortnight.
James leaves next week so that he may
reach home in time for registration on
October 10.
James wonders how the Stanford
student can put so much time into his
work, especially when he has so many
advantages both physical and natural.
He believes that the climate and scen
ery in California are "just too good to
be true." British students are kept in
doors because automobiles are a real
luxury and on account of the murky
weather of England. It is this indoor
tendency that has produced a type of
college student who is inclined to talk
about the more serious aspects of life,
James suggests.
Few English Work Way Through
James deplores the lack of facilities
in the English universities for students
to work their way through college, as
is rarely done in England. He explains
that there are no fraternities or sorori
ties over there. Their places are taken
by living accommodations furnished by
the various colleges making up the uni
versity. *
"Each college is an independent
group, and many times the groups are
widely separated from each other. In
fact Oxford University is so spread
over the town of Oxford that a ten
minute cycle is required in some cases
to go from one to another of the col
leges," says James.
Education Less Specialized in England
The Londoner further explained that
in England education is less specialized
than it is here. More history, literature,
and languages are required with the
result, he thinks, that the average Brit
ain has a better command of the Eng
lish language than-the average Ameri
can. Also there is more discipline in
the British school system. Not only
must students behave in a more so
called gentlemanly manner, but they
are discouraged in "most noble efforts
such as student co-operative associa
tions."
James admitted that he expected to
find in America "more reckless goings
on." The English newspapers, in com
mon with others all over the world,
have a flair for the sensational and so
the English read more of American
crime than anything else about the
country.
