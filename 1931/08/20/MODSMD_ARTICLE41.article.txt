# SCOTCH BALLADS AND INDIAN SONGS FEATURE TONIGHT'S PROGRAM
## 
### 
A program of American Indian songs
and English and Scottish ballads will
be given at 7:30 o'clock tonight in the
Women's- Clubhouse by Dr. Derrick
Norman Lehmer, mathematics profes
sor at the University of California, and
Dr. Margery Bailey, assistant profes
sor of English at Stanford.
Dr. Lehmer's portion of the program
is to be composed of Indian airs, while
Dr. Bailey will sing old English and
Scottish ballads.
The native American lyrics have been
collected by the California mathema
tition during expeditions into the
Northwest and Southwest, when he
made original recordings of numerous
authentic airs. These will be included
in his program of five Chippewa songs:
"Sender of Dreams," "Westward,"
"From the Northland," "Like a Mint
Upon the Mountains," and "The Ghost
Song." The Hopi "When It Rains," and
the Pomo tribal chant, "When It's Rain
ing," along with the Apache and Nava
jo "Coyote Hunting Song," will repre
sent the folk airs of the Southwest.
His recordings made in the North
west will include "The Fingers of the
Sun," "When I'm Singing," "Down the
Stream," three Miwok songs, and Lwo
melodies from the Eskimos, "The Van
ishing," and "Northern Lights."
Among the versatile interests and
accomplishments of Dr. Lehmer are:
Membership in various mathematics
and writers' clubs, editorship of the
University of California Chronicle, a
collection of Indian songs and the com
position of Indian music, and the writ
ing of poetry.
The Phi Beta Kappa poem at Stan
ford in 1922 was composed by him,
and he has encouraged the production
of poetry in this state by acting as
president of the California Writers'
League.
Tonight's program, although present
ed primarily for Dr. Louise Pound's
class in balladry, is open to the pub
lic.
