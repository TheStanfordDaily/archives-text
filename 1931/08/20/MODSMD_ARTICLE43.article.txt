# SECOND GENERATION JAPANESE CHILDREN RESEARCH SUBJECTS
## 
### 
Edward K. Strong, Jr., professor of
psychology in the graduate school of
business, returned from a vacation re
cently to plunge again into research
work on the second generation of Japa
nese children.
"The problem pi'esentcd to me is to
discover what these children, born in
the United States, as American citi
zens, are going to do for a living," said
Dr. Strong.
Must Look to Japan
"In the United States the while race
does not seem inclined to employ Jap
anese, particularly if they come in con
tact with the public or white follow
workers, so the present generation of
Japanese children must look for work
among other Japanese. Their popula
tion is scattered and not large enough
to support itself. At the present time
the race is mostly engaged in agricul
ture, fishing and small stores.
"Scholarship of the Japanese race is
higher than the white," Dr. Strong
added, "and there are few failures of
Japanese children in our schools. Any
school teacher will testify that discip
line of Japanese children is also excel
lent, probably because of their family
training."
97,000 Japanese in State
"At the present time there are about
97,000 Japanese in the State of Cali-
I fornia. Approximately one-half of these
I are second generation children, aver
-1 aging 10 years of age at the present
j time, and as there are few over 21
j years of age," Dr. Strong concluded,
i "It is an interesting illustration of at
| taching and endeavoring to solve a
| problem before it becomes acute."
j Dr. Sti'ong has been assisted in this
i work by Reginald Bell who is compil
! ing statistics to determine the voca
j tional aptitudes and opportunities for
! the second generation Japanese. A
j fund has been established by the Car
| negie Corporation to carry on this work.
