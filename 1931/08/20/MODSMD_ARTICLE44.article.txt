# DANGER OF DIET FAD EXPLAINED TO WOMEN BY MEDICAL ADVISER
## 
### 
"During the summer we strive to re
! duce the weight of our girls and in the
) winter we try to feed them up, so we
| arc kept busy all the year around," was
I the statement made recently by Dr.
j Bertha S. Dyment, medical adviser of
i women.
The tendency of the regular students
j is to keep thin to a point of emaciation,
j Most of them refuse to gain weight and
they run themselves down.
In the summer the women students
generally weigh more, because a large
number of them have been teaching
| school or occupying sedentary positions
j during the year and have not had suf
i ficient exercise or properly balanced
| foods.
People differ widely in weight, oc
| cupation, amount of exercise taken, ac-
I tivity, and physical condition, and their
I diets should also differ. A diet suitable
for one may be detrimental to another;
1 therefore Dr. Dyment advises that a
] physician be consulted before any radi
j cal change in weight is attempted.
A number of students in Stanford
have gained and lost weight and have
j acquired a physical fitness that they
! did not have at the time of entrance
i by consulting with Dr. Dyment and
i following menus, based on a caloric
| chart.
In dieting care must be taken that
| oil the essential elements be included
in the daily menu, which should con
tain protein, mineral substances,! vita
mines, and energy-supplying foods.
Sufficient protein is contained in an
ordinary mixed diet in which milk,
| eggs, meat, fish, and cheese are used.
Fruits and vegetables are important
sources of mineral substances. Milk is
an important element in any diet, and
everyone should drink at least a pint
in some form every day.
According to Dr. Dyment, liquid diet,
the eighteen-day diet, pineapple,
iamb chops, and other food fads, are
foolish and may even prove dangerous
1 to Some women.

Legend has it that football began
with the kicking about of a captured
Dane's head at Chester, England, while
the game at Derby was innovated be
cause of a victory over the Romans.
In 1349 Edward IV prohibited the play
ing of football because it interfered
with the development of archery.
Shrove Tuesday was the favorite day
for football and entire towns would
turn out into the fields to watch the
teams strive to kick the ball between
the upright sticks. An ancient account
shows with what vehemence these
games must have been played.
"After the dissolution of the monas
teries when Sir Roger Townsend was
pulling down the tower of Coxford
Priory, to build himself a goodly house,
the steeple came down with a crash
and fell upon a house nearby, break
ing it down and slaying one, Mr. Sel
ler, who lay lame in it of a broken leg
gotten at foote-ball." As early as
1679 Cambridge, faced with the prob
lem of post-game celebrations, ordered
that there was to be no drinking ex
cept in the college hall itself. Discip
line!
Golf Played by Romans
Golf is no less venerable than "ye
foote ball." Called by the Romans
"paganica," and played with a leather
ball stuffed with feathers, the game
evolved until in the 17th century one
finds quite modern earmarks, without,
however, the saving cry of "Fore!" We
learn from a Royal Library account:
At another time, playing at golf, a
game not unlike to pale-maille, whilst
his schoolmaster stood talking with an
other, and marked not his highness
warning to stand farther off, the prince,
thinking he had gone aside, lifted up
his golf club to strike the ball; mean
time one standing near him said, "Be
ware you hit not Master Newton,
wherewith he, drawing back his hand
said, "Had I done so I would have but
paid my debts."
Swimming and running, being nat
ural sports, have long been the marks
of heroes in epics, as well as of more
modern gentlemen.
Runners Oiled and Naked
The Greeks ran in stadiums, naked,
and started from an upright position.
Races for men were usually multiples I
of a stade, about 200 yards. The long- 1
est race was about 24 stades, or thiee
miles. But there were many classifiea- |
tjons according to age so that the con- |
testants were well selected, and chances !
equal.
Starters in races took their positions i
behind a line, and at the word "Go,"
leapt forward, covered with oil, to |
fight for the "pole" and victory. Some
times the runners shouted to encour
age themselves. Paintings on vases
show us that sprinters were stubby
and muscular, while distance runners
were thin to the point of emaciation, i
Footwork to the Greek was a part of I
living. Hilly country made walking J
necessary, and the phalanx proved that
legs and war were one.

with the development of archery.
Shrove Tuesday was the favorite day
for football and entire towns would
turn out into the fields to watch the
teams strive to kick the ball between
the upright sticks. An ancient account
shows with what vehemence these
games must have been played.
"After the dissolution of the monas
teries when Sir Roger Townsend was
pulling down the tower of Coxford
Priory, to build himself a goodly house,
the steeple came down with a crash
and fell upon a house nearby, break
ing it down and slaying one, Mr. Sel
ler, who lay lame in it of a broken leg
gotten at foote-ball." As early as
1679 Cambridge, faced with the prob
lem of post-game celebrations, ordered
that there was to be no drinking ex
cept in the college hall itself. Discip

Golf Played by Romans
Golf is no less venerable than "ye
foote ball." Called by the Romans
"paganica," and played with a leather
ball stuffed with feathers, the game
evolved until in the 17th century one
finds quite modern earmarks, without,
however, the saving cry of "Fore!" We
learn from a Royal Library account:
At another time, playing at golf, a
game not unlike to pale-maille, whilst
his schoolmaster stood talking with an
other, and marked not his highness
warning to stand farther off, the prince,
thinking he had gone aside, lifted up
his golf club to strike the ball; mean
time one standing near him said, "Be
ware you hit not Master Newton,
wherewith he, drawing back his hand
said, "Had I done so I would have but
paid my debts."
Swimming and running, being nat
ural sports, have long been the marks
of heroes in epics, as well as of more
modern gentlemen.
Runners Oiled and Naked
The Greeks ran in stadiums, naked,
and started from an upright position.
Races for men were usually multiples I
of a stade, about 200 yards. The long- 1
est race was about 24 stades, or thiee
miles. But there were many classifiea- |
tjons according to age so that the con- |
testants were well selected, and chances !
equal.
Starters in races took their positions i
behind a line, and at the word "Go,"
leapt forward, covered with oil, to |
fight for the "pole" and victory. Some
times the runners shouted to encour
age themselves. Paintings on vases
show us that sprinters were stubby
and muscular, while distance runners
were thin to the point of emaciation, i
Footwork to the Greek was a part of I
living. Hilly country made walking J
necessary, and the phalanx proved that
legs and war were one.
"During the summer we strive to re
! duce the weight of our girls and in the
) winter we try to feed them up, so we
| arc kept busy all the year around," was
I the statement made recently by Dr.
j Bertha S. Dyment, medical adviser of
i women.
The tendency of the regular students
j is to keep thin to a point of emaciation,
j Most of them refuse to gain weight and
they run themselves down.
In the summer the women students
generally weigh more, because a large
number of them have been teaching
| school or occupying sedentary positions
j during the year and have not had suf
i ficient exercise or properly balanced
| foods.
People differ widely in weight, oc
| cupation, amount of exercise taken, ac-
I tivity, and physical condition, and their
I diets should also differ. A diet suitable
for one may be detrimental to another;
1 therefore Dr. Dyment advises that a
] physician be consulted before any radi
j cal change in weight is attempted.
A number of students in Stanford
have gained and lost weight and have
j acquired a physical fitness that they
! did not have at the time of entrance
i by consulting with Dr. Dyment and
i following menus, based on a caloric
| chart.
In dieting care must be taken that
| oil the essential elements be included
in the daily menu, which should con
tain protein, mineral substances,! vita
mines, and energy-supplying foods.
Sufficient protein is contained in an
ordinary mixed diet in which milk,
| eggs, meat, fish, and cheese are used.
Fruits and vegetables are important
sources of mineral substances. Milk is
an important element in any diet, and
everyone should drink at least a pint
in some form every day.
According to Dr. Dyment, liquid diet,
the eighteen-day diet, pineapple,
iamb chops, and other food fads, are
foolish and may even prove dangerous
1 to Some women.

"During the summer we strive to re
! duce the weight of our girls and in the
) winter we try to feed them up, so we
| arc kept busy all the year around," was
I the statement made recently by Dr.
j Bertha S. Dyment, medical adviser of
i women.
The tendency of the regular students
j is to keep thin to a point of emaciation,
j Most of them refuse to gain weight and
they run themselves down.
In the summer the women students
generally weigh more, because a large
number of them have been teaching
| school or occupying sedentary positions
j during the year and have not had suf
i ficient exercise or properly balanced
| foods.
People differ widely in weight, oc
| cupation, amount of exercise taken, ac-
I tivity, and physical condition, and their
I diets should also differ. A diet suitable
for one may be detrimental to another;
1 therefore Dr. Dyment advises that a
] physician be consulted before any radi
j cal change in weight is attempted.
A number of students in Stanford
have gained and lost weight and have
j acquired a physical fitness that they
! did not have at the time of entrance
i by consulting with Dr. Dyment and
i following menus, based on a caloric
| chart.
In dieting care must be taken that
| oil the essential elements be included
in the daily menu, which should con
tain protein, mineral substances,! vita
mines, and energy-supplying foods.
Sufficient protein is contained in an
ordinary mixed diet in which milk,
| eggs, meat, fish, and cheese are used.
Fruits and vegetables are important
sources of mineral substances. Milk is
an important element in any diet, and
everyone should drink at least a pint
in some form every day.
According to Dr. Dyment, liquid diet,
the eighteen-day diet, pineapple,
iamb chops, and other food fads, are
foolish and may even prove dangerous
1 to Some women.

Legend has it that football began
with the kicking about of a captured
Dane's head at Chester, England, while
the game at Derby was innovated be
cause of a victory over the Romans.
In 1349 Edward IV prohibited the play
ing of football because it interfered
with the development of archery.
Shrove Tuesday was the favorite day
for football and entire towns would
turn out into the fields to watch the
teams strive to kick the ball between
the upright sticks. An ancient account
shows with what vehemence these
games must have been played.
"After the dissolution of the monas
teries when Sir Roger Townsend was
pulling down the tower of Coxford
Priory, to build himself a goodly house,
the steeple came down with a crash
and fell upon a house nearby, break
ing it down and slaying one, Mr. Sel
ler, who lay lame in it of a broken leg
gotten at foote-ball." As early as
1679 Cambridge, faced with the prob
lem of post-game celebrations, ordered
that there was to be no drinking ex
cept in the college hall itself. Discip
line!
Golf Played by Romans
Golf is no less venerable than "ye
foote ball." Called by the Romans
"paganica," and played with a leather
ball stuffed with feathers, the game
evolved until in the 17th century one
finds quite modern earmarks, without,
however, the saving cry of "Fore!" We
learn from a Royal Library account:
At another time, playing at golf, a
game not unlike to pale-maille, whilst
his schoolmaster stood talking with an
other, and marked not his highness
warning to stand farther off, the prince,
thinking he had gone aside, lifted up
his golf club to strike the ball; mean
time one standing near him said, "Be
ware you hit not Master Newton,
wherewith he, drawing back his hand
said, "Had I done so I would have but
paid my debts."
Swimming and running, being nat
ural sports, have long been the marks
of heroes in epics, as well as of more
modern gentlemen.
Runners Oiled and Naked
The Greeks ran in stadiums, naked,
and started from an upright position.
Races for men were usually multiples I
of a stade, about 200 yards. The long- 1
est race was about 24 stades, or thiee
miles. But there were many classifiea- |
tjons according to age so that the con- |
testants were well selected, and chances !
equal.
