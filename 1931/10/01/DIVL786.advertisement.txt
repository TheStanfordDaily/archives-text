IT S A FACT!
Thurlow's prepares their dinners
entirely separate from their lunches
and the menu is entirely different.
11 is now possible to eat at a restaur
ant in Palo Alto and not have the
same thing for dinner as you had for
lunch.
Incidentally we are offering a spe
cial lunch at 45c and an evening
dinner at 50c.
