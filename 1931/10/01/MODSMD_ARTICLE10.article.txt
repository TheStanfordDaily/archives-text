# NOTABLES PAY HIGH TRIBUTE TO DR. JORDAN
## Stanford Students Facing Loss of Chancellor's Directing Spirit 
### 
For the first time since the open- j
ing of Stanford in 1891, its students j
will register at a university in which
the presence of David Starr Jordan
will not be felt.
Forty successive classes of Stan- |
ford men and women came directly
within the radius of the personal
influence of Dr. Jordan. Even after
his illness he did not lose touch
with the students' activities. Men of
all ranks throughout the country
regret his passing, but the Stanford
students face the heaviest loss.,
President Hoover
President Hoover paid the chan
cellor-emeritus the following trib
ute: "Dr. Jordan's death will be felt
by many thousands of students who
came to him in fifty years of activc
leadership. Few in his calling have
won such universal affection."
Governor Rolph, when informed i
of the death of Dr. Jordan, made the
following statement: I knew him j
well for many years and valued his
friendship. He was an inspiration
to all youth, not only at Stanford
University, but in all other univer
sities of the nation. When he spoke
everyone listened; when he Wrote
everyone read."
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, presi
dent of the University of California,
said: "The sorrow is not Stanford's
alone. The University of California
and its thousands of students, alum
ni and alumnae, share that sorrow, j
for David Starr Jordan's ideals were
not bounded by the walls of any
one institution. His three oustanding
qualities were liberality in thought,
courage of convictions, and inde- \
fatigability in labor."
San Francisco's mayor likewise
joined in the universal expressions j
of praise. Mayor Rossi declared:
"Dr. Jordan typified the highest type
of American citizen. Few university
presidents have made as deep an
impress on the minds and charac
ters of their students."
A tribute to Dr. Jordan as "one
of the truly great men of this gener
ation" was paid by Dr. Robert
Swain, acting president of Stanford
University. Dr. Swain said in part;
"David Starr Jordan possessed an
inspiring personality, the power and
spread of whose influence cannot be
measured. He has made an enduring
contribution to the fund of human j
knowledge."

of the death of Dr. Jordan, made the
following statement: I knew him j
well for many years and valued his
friendship. He was an inspiration
to all youth, not only at Stanford
University, but in all other univer
sities of the nation. When he spoke
everyone listened; when he Wrote
everyone read."
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, presi
dent of the University of California,
said: "The sorrow is not Stanford's
alone. The University of California
and its thousands of students, alum
ni and alumnae, share that sorrow, j
for David Starr Jordan's ideals were
not bounded by the walls of any
one institution. His three oustanding
qualities were liberality in thought,
courage of convictions, and inde- \
fatigability in labor."
San Francisco's mayor likewise
joined in the universal expressions j
of praise. Mayor Rossi declared:
"Dr. Jordan typified the highest type
of American citizen. Few university
presidents have made as deep an
impress on the minds and charac
ters of their students."
A tribute to Dr. Jordan as "one
of the truly great men of this gener
ation" was paid by Dr. Robert
Swain, acting president of Stanford
University. Dr. Swain said in part;
"David Starr Jordan possessed an
inspiring personality, the power and
spread of whose influence cannot be
measured. He has made an enduring
contribution to the fund of human j
knowledge."
