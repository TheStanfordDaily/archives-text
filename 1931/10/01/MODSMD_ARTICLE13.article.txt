Almost two weeks have
elapsed since Stanford's own
David Starr Jordan passed on.
There is nothing that the Daily
can add to the homage that men
of every rank have already paid
to the man who had worked so
well and so faithfully for Stan
ford, for peace, and for human
welfare.
As long as there has been a
Stanford University, there has
been directly associated with it
a David Starr Jordan. He helped
to build it. and now he is gone.
But the memory of his name and
Ins deeds will remain—a sym
bol of Stanford and its
mightiest tradition.
