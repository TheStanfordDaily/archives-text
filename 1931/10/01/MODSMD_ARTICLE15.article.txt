j WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. (/P) —A
| plan involving curtailed naval oper-
I ation has been laid before Secretary
Adams by Admiral William V.
1 Pratt, chief of naval operations, as
! a possible method of meeting Presi
-1 dent Hoover's demands for 1933
; budget cuts.
Basic naval policy would remain
| unaffected under the plan.
Immediately upon his return from
1 a trip to the West Coast, the Ad-
I miral turned his attention to Presi
| dent Hoover's request to Secretary
Adams that the naval budget esti
j mates for 1933 be cut sharply from
their original figure of $401,000,000.
The number of destroyers to be
built under Congressional authoriza
; tion already has been reduced from
11 to 5. The plan involves rotation
' of vessels in service rather than con
j stant use. The question of shore
establishments including possible
abandonments or curtailments has
been considered!
