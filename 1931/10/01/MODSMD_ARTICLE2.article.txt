## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (A 3 ). —
Domestic petroleum production in
the United States for August was
68,418,000 barrels for a daily average
of 2,207,000, a decline of 12 per cent
from the previous month.
The August figures reflected in
full the military shutdown of the
Oklahoma flush fields right after
August 1, and the closing of all East
Texas wells late in the month.
The decline in production caused
a withdrawal from storage tanks of
close to 1G,000.000 barrels, the largest
ever made. The decline, however,
led to a total reduction of crude
stocks of 14,000,000 barrels with the
remainder accounted for by with
drawal of refined products.
The daily average new supply
during August totaled 2,314,000 bar
rels, whereas the daily average in
dicated domestic demand for all oils
was 2,048,000 barrels. This indicated
an approximate deficiency during
August of 334,000 barrels daily.
