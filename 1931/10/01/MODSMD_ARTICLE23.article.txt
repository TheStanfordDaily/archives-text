he predicted. Every country, he said,
would gain something by the move.

Urges Silver Parley
Returning to a discussion of sil
ver, he said:
"As a direct result of economic
disturbances all over the world and
the suspension of the gold standard
in most European countries I believe
silver will come into its own. It is
necessaiy, and most countries, in
cluding Great Britain, are beginning
to idealize its importance in value.
