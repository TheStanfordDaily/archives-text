# 'Average' Warner Grid Combination To Battle Broncs
## Tough Contest May Be Expected After Showing Made By Santa Clara Against Bears Last Saturday; Smith Will Start Strongest Team SUPERIOR MAN-POWER MAY DECIDE CONTEST First And Second Teams Combined To Produce Varied Line With Backfield Divided In Positions 
### BY LOWELL COX 
a Stanford team of ''average" squad strength hilled to start against
the strongest combination Coach Clipper Smith can muster, the
Stanford-Santa Clara game in the Stadium Saturday looms ;» really tougii
contest. For three quarters the Broncos battled California to a standstill
last Saturday, in fact outplayed the Bear eleven, and they are not to be
taken lightly. Only a laek of man-power keeps them from being one of
the most formidable elevens on the coast. It is evident that Smith will
follow his policy of the California contest, "putting his best foot forward
• and hoping the other will follow."

The dipper has about 18 good men.
and if they can last the game out,
Santa Clara will be a mighty for
midable opponent.
Meanwhile Coach "Pop" Warner
has announced he will continue hi.;
policy of the 0-0 Olympic Club game
of last Saturday, starting a team of
approximately average strength, and
by substitutions keeping it at that
point throughout the contest.
Mixed Team to Start
The starting whistle will find ;i
mixture of first- and second-string
men in both the Indian line and
baekfield. First-team ends will flank
a line made up largely of second
string men, with the exception of
Hulen, while in the baekfield La
combe and Afflerbaugh will work
at halves with the more experience J
Baker and Caddel.
This would indicate that at no
time will maximum Stanford
strength be pitted against the
Broncos.
If Stan Anderson, sophomore full
back prospect, sees much action in
the game, an interesting punting
duel should result between him and
Pagliu, Bronco punting star. Ii wa.-
Paglia's long kicks which played so
big a part in keeping the Bears be
tween their own 20- and 40-yard
markers much of the time last week.
Anderson Outkicks Caddel
In practice yesterday Anderson
consistently out-kicked Caddel by
10 to 15 yards in a punting scrim
mage. All of Anderson's efforts
traveled from 45 to 55 yards, and
had sufficient height to enable the
ends to get down under them. La
combe's returns of his punts were
another feature of the otherwise un
eventful practice.

Anderson Outkicks Caddel
In practice yesterday Anderson
consistently out-kicked Caddel by
10 to 15 yards in a punting scrim
mage. All of Anderson's efforts
traveled from 45 to 55 yards, and
had sufficient height to enable the
ends to get down under them. La

Warner sent most of the squad
through a 30-minute scrimmage ses

rather sloppy, but with defon •
showing improvement. Marks and
Laborde were both in evidence on
defense, breaking up a number of
plays in the making.
Commenting on the approachi:\(;
game, Warner pointed out that Santa
Clara always invades the Farm with
a strong team backed by their en
tire student body, looking on tin
annual meeting in the light of a hi:;
game, while Stanford is forced to
take the contest in stride.
With the result of Stanford ovei -
confidence and bad breaks in the
past only too well known, the game
Saturday can hardiv be regarded as
a sure thing, but because of superior
man-power, if nothing else, the In
dians should come out on top.
The entire squad is in good shape
with the exceptions of Gribben and
Clark. Clark, scheduled to start at
end Saturday, is in the hospital with
an attack of influenza and a tem
perature of 102. Gribben, under
study of Ehrhorn at tackle, is suf
fering fiom a leg injury which will
keep him on the bench for several
weeks.
a Stanford team of ''average" squad strength hilled to start against
the strongest combination Coach Clipper Smith can muster, the
Stanford-Santa Clara game in the Stadium Saturday looms ;» really tougii
contest. For three quarters the Broncos battled California to a standstill
last Saturday, in fact outplayed the Bear eleven, and they are not to be
taken lightly. Only a laek of man-power keeps them from being one of
the most formidable elevens on the coast. It is evident that Smith will
follow his policy of the California contest, "putting his best foot forward
• and hoping the other will follow."

The dipper has about 18 good men.
and if they can last the game out,
Santa Clara will be a mighty for
midable opponent.
Meanwhile Coach "Pop" Warner
has announced he will continue hi.;
policy of the 0-0 Olympic Club game
of last Saturday, starting a team of
approximately average strength, and
by substitutions keeping it at that
point throughout the contest.
Mixed Team to Start
The starting whistle will find ;i
mixture of first- and second-string
men in both the Indian line and
