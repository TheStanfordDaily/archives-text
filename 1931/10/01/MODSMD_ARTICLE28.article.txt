Willi more Hum half ;i million dollars outstanding in

the business department ot Stanford University Itns taken
steps looking to protection of this investment by tightening j
up the requirements upon which eligibility for loans are j
based.
Stanford is unique among educational institutions of the J
country with its loan service to students, drawing ils funds j
from the working capital of the University.
Heretofore, tuition loans have been available to students i
upon little more than mere application for such loans. This j
year the procedure has been revised to follow more closely
established banking customs, requiring a financial state
ment from the applicant and the approval of the parent or
guardian.
Benefits to both student and University are apparent at
once. For the student, a practical training in business meth
ods and procedure is to be gained under the new plan. Each
one must be able to give a complete and comprehensive
statement of his financial condition, with income, expendi
tures, nnd obligations carefully tabulated.
For the University, adequate information concerning the
financial ability of the needy student is available for the lirst
lime, ('.list's have been cited wherein certain students have
applied for and been granted loans for tuition at the same
lime they were drawing funds for that purpose from parents
or other sources. Such double-dealing can now he elimi
nated. It might be advisable to have the endorsement of
notes by parents or guardians to give the I niversitv still
further protection in ease of the death or disability of the
borrower. In this connection, life insurance becomes a val
uable asset in the eligibility of a student to receive a loan.
Most large foundations require both these elements of se
curity on loans.
Tuition loans are granted for periods ranging up to
seven years and are non-interest-bearing until the date of
maturity, after which interest is charged at the rate of six
per cent. Thus, large sums of money are tied up for long
periods of time and become non-productive. In spite of the
comparatively meager working capital of the University,
Stanford is far more liberal in its loan provisions than any
other educational institution.
