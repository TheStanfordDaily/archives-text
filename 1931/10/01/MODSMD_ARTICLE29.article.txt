# INCAUTIOUS INGRAM
## 
### 
Willi colors flying and whistles tooting, "Navv Hill" In
gram steamed into port early last spring and announced lo
the world in general that California was going to have a
football team. The whistle-tooting has subsided somewhat
since Navy Hill got a look at some of ins material in scrim
mage and actual combat, but there is still the memory of
il'ose luncheon addresses last spring to make Ingram wish
to high heaven he had been a little more tight-lipped.
No one can fail to appreciate the difficult situation into
which the former Annapolis coach stepped \ylicn he took
over the coaching reins across the bay, but he certainly did
not ease his own going a little bit by those grandiose
speeches before the San Rafael Chamber of Commerce, the
May ward Lions Club, and the Strawberry Canyon Literary
Guild. Had he come quietly to his task, said nothing and
promised nothing in the way of future great Hear football
teams, the wolves might have held oft for a while, if Ingram
fails to produce a winner this year.
Frankly, it would take pretty much of a miracle man to
ease the Hears through the 19,'U season with fewer than
three defeats, and Ingram, with all due respect for his coach
ing ability, is hardly that. lie has, not in so many words,
Ixii by his numerous luncheon speeches led the t Alumni
and the football public at large to expect a great deal on the
gridiron. The alumni wolves want victories, and they want
them this year, and not next year, and they have gobbled up
some of Ingram's choice morsels voraciously.
In short, Hill had better produce, or he will meet the
same treatment that drove Nibs Price from his post. He
will be Navy Hill until he fails; then he will be just another
marine to the alumni. When they start to howl, Ingram will
wish he were back on one of bis battleships during target
practice, or some other place of comparative quiet.
