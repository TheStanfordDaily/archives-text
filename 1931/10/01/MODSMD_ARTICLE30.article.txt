# "WHAT THIS CAMPUS NEEDS"
## 
### 
In 111is year of the big slump, prices, like are com
ing down. Which brings us to a subject which lias long been
a sore point with every Stanford man who drinks coffee at
any time.
The t'nion dining system lias undergone many changes,
most of them for the better, since Miss Christine Kicker took
over the management, lint, why in the name of all that's
holy, must the student body lay one complete dime on the
line for a lone, unadorned, single cup of coffee?
.lust what it costs the t'nion to make one cup of coffee is
not known to the Daily, but if it is over two cents, overhead
and all, someone ought t<Â» be out of a job. The universal
price for the beverage, served as it is iri the t'nion and the
Kncina store, is one nickel. When will the Union quit push
inn a good thing 100 far, and give the students a live-cent
cup of coffee ?
The editorial board and the night editors are requested
to be present at the Office at two o clock this alter
noon.
