# BULL SESSION
## 
### TO THE FRESHMEN OF 1935 
It is poor policy to give advice to 1
women or freshmen — both know j
everything and are sorry they
learned it. The great majority of ;
newcomers to a college campus
have more preconceived ideas that
are wrong than the administration
has wrong ways to cure the depres
sion. These false impressions are
derived from many sources—movies,
books, College Humor, youth's de
sire for adventure, and just general
folklore invented by distant uncles
who flunked out in their first year
and perpetuated by sophomores who
never lost their freshman complex.
Now strange as it seems, the ma
jor purpose of college is not found
on the football field, in throwing
water bags out of Encina, in long
trips to Mills, or shorter but less
worth-while trips to Roble. A uni
versity piay not be the moth-eaten
place it used to be; but it is still the
house of learning. Contacts and
social grace are delightful argu
ments that can be used to convince
people on the merits of a college
education but if a good hand at
bridge, a divine waltz, and several
golf companions are the sole results
you have to show when you are
handed a sheepskin, your college
investment has been a sorry fizzle.
On the other hand, a grind is not
the aim or ideal of this campus. It
is necessary and somewhat worth
while to "hit" the exams and quizzes
that are featured here from time to
time along with football games,

Jolly-ups, and shows at Paly. But
more important than learning the
stereotyped facts that textbooks de- j
light to spatter over their - musty I
pages, is to know the score (in the
the better sense of the word).
Don't think it is a sin against col
legiate swagger to know the politi
cal situation here and abroad. Mary
with the big blue eyes and Joe the
punter and the fellow that drops
laundry cans from the fourth floor—
should not be the sole topics of con
versation. Don't answer all ques
tions in moronic monosyllables; it
doesn't stamp you as a college man
or woman. On the contrary, you
sound like a Milpitas High senior
that wandered from home.
And Stanford has or should have
a more personal effect on you. "The
Winds of Freedom Are Blowing" is
the motto of this University. This
doesn't mean that "lockouts" are
just so many words; or that hours
in the Convalescent Home for con
duct unbecoming a Stanford gentle
man is an idle threat. The motto of
this University, as personified in the
late David Starr Jordan, implies a
liberal view toward all questions.
Don't get in a mental rut and then
complain because of the shade. New
ideas do not bite! Everything the
professor says is not gospel; but on
the other hand keep an ear open,
! you may pick up an idea now and
then.

laundry cans from the fourth floor—
should not be the sole topics of con
versation. Don't answer all ques
tions in moronic monosyllables; it
doesn't stamp you as a college man
or woman. On the contrary, you
sound like a Milpitas High senior
that wandered from home.
And Stanford has or should have
a more personal effect on you. "The
Winds of Freedom Are Blowing" is
the motto of this University. This
doesn't mean that "lockouts" are
just so many words; or that hours
in the Convalescent Home for con
duct unbecoming a Stanford gentle
man is an idle threat. The motto of
this University, as personified in the
late David Starr Jordan, implies a
liberal view toward all questions.
Don't get in a mental rut and then
complain because of the shade. New
ideas do not bite! Everything the
professor says is not gospel; but on
the other hand keep an ear open,
! you may pick up an idea now and
then.

It is poor policy to give advice to 1
women or freshmen — both know j
everything and are sorry they
learned it. The great majority of ;
newcomers to a college campus
have more preconceived ideas that
are wrong than the administration
has wrong ways to cure the depres
sion. These false impressions are
derived from many sources—movies,
books, College Humor, youth's de
sire for adventure, and just general
folklore invented by distant uncles
who flunked out in their first year
and perpetuated by sophomores who
never lost their freshman complex.
Now strange as it seems, the ma
jor purpose of college is not found
on the football field, in throwing
water bags out of Encina, in long
trips to Mills, or shorter but less
worth-while trips to Roble. A uni
versity piay not be the moth-eaten
place it used to be; but it is still the
house of learning. Contacts and
social grace are delightful argu
ments that can be used to convince
people on the merits of a college
education but if a good hand at
bridge, a divine waltz, and several
golf companions are the sole results
you have to show when you are
handed a sheepskin, your college
investment has been a sorry fizzle.
On the other hand, a grind is not
the aim or ideal of this campus. It
is necessary and somewhat worth
while to "hit" the exams and quizzes
that are featured here from time to
time along with football games,

Jolly-ups, and shows at Paly. But
more important than learning the
stereotyped facts that textbooks de- j
light to spatter over their - musty I
pages, is to know the score (in the
the better sense of the word).
Don't think it is a sin against col
legiate swagger to know the politi
cal situation here and abroad. Mary
with the big blue eyes and Joe the
punter and the fellow that drops
laundry cans from the fourth floor—
should not be the sole topics of con
versation. Don't answer all ques
tions in moronic monosyllables; it
doesn't stamp you as a college man
or woman. On the contrary, you
