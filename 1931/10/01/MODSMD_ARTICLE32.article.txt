### 
NINE O'CLOCK REVUE at the
Geary Theatre
This is an entertaining conglom
eration of your favorite spices—cin
namon, nutmeg, and pepper—they're
all there, however loosely they may
be thrown together. The chorus is
top notch on looks and strutting, the
costumes are colorful, and the tal
ent is real stuff. Maxine "Tut" Mace
was about the niftiest little fixture
on the stage. She can dance and she
does decorate her surroundings.
Eddie Lambert earns the title "co
; median" in his "geelijo'' act. Borden
i and Herman are the "get-a-laugh"
1 boys in the show and their success
j depends on the number of times
: that you've heard their gags.
As usual, the Holand and Knight
I team convince you that they're per
fectly swell, and when it comes to
! smooth adagio motion, Dot Schaefer
land Billy Taft are the people you're
! looking for.
With all the makings of a "best
| ever" show, the revue does an
i amazing job of failing to make the
i most of them. The second act drags
|on sadly until the ultimate finale
I tells you that it's time to go home.
Don't blush at the first chorus
j number — and DON'T miss going
j down to Continental Bar in the
basement.

1 PERSONAL MAID at the Stanford
Not a particularly forceful thing,
| the movie seems one of Nancy Car
| roll's best performances. The type
is much more suitable to the Car

roll appearance and manner than
some she has had recently.
The young scapegrace son of the
maid's distress does quite well in
an interesting, if not especially im
portant, part. There is an abun
dance of good acting throughout,
and the composition of the picture
is quite satisfactory.

Horace Liveright. 1930. (At the
Magazine Shop)
Glory was always a remarkable
child for her age. When three or
four she lisped philosophically con
cerning Love and Life; but it was
at fifteen that she was truly pro
digious. Then she turned away pas
sionate collegiate adolescent and
! grey Don Juan alike with appropri
i ate aphorisms from Horace and
some quaintly unconventional bit
I from La Fontaine.
I Finally, during a hectic week-end
; party, she found Peter and nursed
| him back to health after an irate
j husband had misunderstood his
' doubtless honorable intentions. Pe
| ter was her beau lover and, mar
! ried to him, she was happy, the
dish-washing a joyous preparation.
Carman Barnes said all that she
! had to say in Schoolgirl, which, de
| spite critical jeers, was interesting,
i In Beau Lover her heroine, though
less thin and languid, is impossible.
And the constant mental snufflings
! concerning the tender passion be -
! come tiresome.

Glory was always a remarkable
child for her age. When three or
four she lisped philosophically con
cerning Love and Life; but it was
at fifteen that she was truly pro
digious. Then she turned away pas
sionate collegiate adolescent and
! grey Don Juan alike with appropri
i ate aphorisms from Horace and
some quaintly unconventional bit
I from La Fontaine.
I Finally, during a hectic week-end
; party, she found Peter and nursed

j husband had misunderstood his
' doubtless honorable intentions. Pe
| ter was her beau lover and, mar
! ried to him, she was happy, the
dish-washing a joyous preparation.
Carman Barnes said all that she
! had to say in Schoolgirl, which, de
| spite critical jeers, was interesting,
i In Beau Lover her heroine, though
less thin and languid, is impossible.
And the constant mental snufflings

NINE O'CLOCK REVUE at the
Geary Theatre
This is an entertaining conglom
eration of your favorite spices—cin
namon, nutmeg, and pepper—they're
all there, however loosely they may
be thrown together. The chorus is
top notch on looks and strutting, the
costumes are colorful, and the tal
ent is real stuff. Maxine "Tut" Mace
was about the niftiest little fixture
on the stage. She can dance and she
does decorate her surroundings.
Eddie Lambert earns the title "co
; median" in his "geelijo'' act. Borden
i and Herman are the "get-a-laugh"
1 boys in the show and their success
j depends on the number of times
: that you've heard their gags.
As usual, the Holand and Knight
I team convince you that they're per
fectly swell, and when it comes to
! smooth adagio motion, Dot Schaefer
land Billy Taft are the people you're
! looking for.
