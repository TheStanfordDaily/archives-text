Back at the old grind again, all of
us, and it looks as though the race
were to go to the best evader of the
bill collector. Fewer nickel-plated
speed-breakers and more good, sub
stantial rattle-traps are on deck.
Everything points to a return of the
good old days when Stanfordites
were real farmers and not weed
patch growers.
«
The '35 crop is something dif
ferent. again. The feminine con
tingent deserves applause and
its own brass band. Better look
ing than usual, and they act al
most as though they belonged.
With everyone eating in the
Cellar, the last couple of days,
the real problem has been to
distinguish between frosh and
sponsors.
Encina harbors at least two real
collegians, who arrived Tuesday
with class numerals, nicknames, and

! Stanford nameplates inked all over |
1 their nice, new suede jackets. Boys 1
i will be —annihilated if they don't \
j reform.
;
Fallen plaster and dried paint
! in bathtubs, crowds of students
buying toothpaste at the 5-and
-10. and the same old would-be
gates, with just a little more

something, though lord knows
what.

People customarily start new j

edges on its Luna sandwiches, now,
for nothing more than a dirty look.
We're waiting anxiously this
morning to see if anything dras
tic has happened to the tuition
habit. Only the weather re
mains unchanged. And an aw
ful lot of people who flunked
out in June have strangely been
re-admitted. What does it mean,
Mr. President? We have a lot
of questions for someone.
