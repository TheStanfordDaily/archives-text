# Yearling Strength Inconsistent in Opening Contests
## BABES ROUT MARIN BUT HELD TO TIE BY S.F. TEACHERS Freshmen to Meet Strong L.A. Jaysees Saturday In Preliminary 
### BY STEWART CRAWFORD 
Has, or hasn't, James "Rabbit"
Bradshaw the best yearling eleven
seen in these parts since the loudly
lamented "cut" of freshman registra
tion which paired down his turnout
possibilities some 30 per cent'.'
That's a fairly large order to fill,
probably one to be termed "ridicu
lous" by the skeptics who saw the
youngsters struggle four quarters
against a supposedly weak San
Francisco Teachers College team
last Saturday to gain nothing better
than a scoreless tie.
First Showing Good
But, on the other hand, if you
had been here a week ago to ask a
witness of the Marin J.C.-Indian
freshman contest of two Saturdays
past, the answer might very pos
sibly have been: "Well, perhaps he
has."
And to prove his point, this wit
ness could have gone on to cite the
37 to 0 score against a jaysee outfit
which was one of the strongest in
the bay region last year, and rated
as not so weak despite an entirely
new lineup this season.
He could have told you how, after
but three days of organized prac
tice, the babes went out to play
finished ball, working reverses, fake
or double, with a precision of mid
season quality.
Look Fairly Light
Eut - let this man go his way while
we describe how the Papcose eleven
looked from the press box, where
we were pleasantly rewarded for
arriving early enough to witness the
entire game.
Forty-four strong, the youngsters
trotted onto the field for their initial
appearance under a cardinal ban
ner, and right away fans began to
wonder "are they heavy enough?"
They did look small.
But when the starting eleven took
the field for the kickoff, it looked
as though Bradshaw had concen
trated most of his beef in the first
string line, which was plenty hefty
for a freshman ball club.
Mulier, Kahn at Ends
At ends were Mulier and Kahn,
weighing 160 and 170 pounds, re
spectively. Lettunich and Steiner,
tackles, loomed as two of the big
gest men on the squad, tipping the
beam at 193 and 180.
Guards were comparatively light,
but not exactly featherweights. Sem
melroth is listed at 174, while Mott
ram, on the other side, weighs 163
pounds. And the center position was
held down by some 195 pounds of
beef belonging to a young man
named Van Kirk.
In the backfield, the meat was
pretty well balanced, with a couple
of light halfbacks at about 153
pounds each, Beach and Kelley. Aj
might be expected in a Warner
style team, the weight in the back
field was carried by the quarter and
full, berths filled by Flannagan, 130,
and Moore, 177 pounds.
Line Functions Well
After the kickoff against Marin,
everyone settled back to see the un
practiced freshmen take a beating.
Imagine their surprise, then, when
that Papoose line began opening
holes right and left to let Beach and
Kelley slide off tackle or around the
ends.
And then this man Moore, who
hails from far-off lowa, began
smacking the line with power remi
niscent of Chuck Smalling. Flanna
gan, too, plunged through repeated
ly for substantial gains. The contest
turned into a rout, as one might
guess from the 37 to 0 count, and
the question became not who would
win, but who, exactly, did Bradshaw
have?
First, he has a couple of guards
that show plenty of promise. Both
Semmelroth and Mottram looked
good, but the latter showed like a
real star. More than one Marin punt
he blocked during the afternoon. His
home, by the way, is in San Fran
cisco, where he played bang-up prep
school ball for Mission High.
Center Job Filled
The center job and tackle berths
seemed satisfactorily filled by the
starters in this game, while Brad
shaw did quite a little shifting at
the wing positions.
Three men, Kahn, Mulier, and
Woolley, will probably have it out
between them for the end jobs, with
several other likely candidates close
on their heels.
In the backfield, other than Moore
at full who was by far the outstand
ing man on the field, Flannagan at
quarter was best. This big boy from
Oklahoma has been out of school for
some time and appeared slightly
i usty, but watch him improve as the
season progresses. He has the mak
ings of a real star.
Lawry Rothert Plays
Lawry Rothert, brother to the
great Harlow, went in at half during
the Marin game, and the eyes of
every fan focused on him in hope of
discovering qualities that might de
velop into Harlow proportions.

TTT" I
I Larry showed a fair brand of ball, j
i He may yet ape his brother.
Charley Seaver, better known as !
| one of the country's leading ama- !
' tour golfers, was not in a suit that
j day, but turned out in time to start
a fullback against he S.F. teachers, i
! while Moore was shifed to half. j
With a little more praetice and a j
j bit more fire, Seaver may become [
I one of the mainstays of Bradshaw's
! eleven.
L.A.J.C. Tilt Next
Saturday's preliminary game will
find the freshmen in their third ap- ;
| pearance of the season, that against i
Los Angeles Junior College. These j
: boys are reputed to be tough, and
' use a Notre Dame system, so a lot j
j may be answered in that tilt.

j mental let-down for the yearlings. !

weighing 160 and 170 pounds, re
spectively. Lettunich and Steiner,
tackles, loomed as two of the big
gest men on the squad, tipping the
beam at 193 and 180.
Guards were comparatively light,
but not exactly featherweights. Sem
melroth is listed at 174, while Mott
ram, on the other side, weighs 163
pounds. And the center position was
held down by some 195 pounds of
beef belonging to a young man
named Van Kirk.
In the backfield, the meat was
pretty well balanced, with a couple
of light halfbacks at about 153
pounds each, Beach and Kelley. Aj
might be expected in a Warner
style team, the weight in the back
field was carried by the quarter and
full, berths filled by Flannagan, 130,
and Moore, 177 pounds.
Line Functions Well
After the kickoff against Marin,
everyone settled back to see the un
practiced freshmen take a beating.
Imagine their surprise, then, when
that Papoose line began opening
holes right and left to let Beach and
Kelley slide off tackle or around the
ends.
And then this man Moore, who
hails from far-off lowa, began
smacking the line with power remi
niscent of Chuck Smalling. Flanna
gan, too, plunged through repeated
ly for substantial gains. The contest
turned into a rout, as one might
guess from the 37 to 0 count, and
the question became not who would
win, but who, exactly, did Bradshaw
have?
First, he has a couple of guards
that show plenty of promise. Both
Semmelroth and Mottram looked
good, but the latter showed like a
real star. More than one Marin punt
he blocked during the afternoon. His
home, by the way, is in San Fran
cisco, where he played bang-up prep
school ball for Mission High.
Center Job Filled
The center job and tackle berths
seemed satisfactorily filled by the
starters in this game, while Brad
shaw did quite a little shifting at
the wing positions.
Three men, Kahn, Mulier, and
Woolley, will probably have it out
between them for the end jobs, with
several other likely candidates close
on their heels.
In the backfield, other than Moore
at full who was by far the outstand
ing man on the field, Flannagan at
quarter was best. This big boy from
Oklahoma has been out of school for
some time and appeared slightly
i usty, but watch him improve as the
season progresses. He has the mak
ings of a real star.
Lawry Rothert Plays
Lawry Rothert, brother to the
great Harlow, went in at half during
the Marin game, and the eyes of
every fan focused on him in hope of
discovering qualities that might de
velop into Harlow proportions.

Has, or hasn't, James "Rabbit"

probably one to be termed "ridicu

youngsters struggle four quarters
against a supposedly weak San
Francisco Teachers College team
last Saturday to gain nothing better
than a scoreless tie.
First Showing Good
But, on the other hand, if you
had been here a week ago to ask a
witness of the Marin J.C.-Indian
freshman contest of two Saturdays
past, the answer might very pos
sibly have been: "Well, perhaps he
has."
And to prove his point, this wit
ness could have gone on to cite the
37 to 0 score against a jaysee outfit
which was one of the strongest in
the bay region last year, and rated
as not so weak despite an entirely
new lineup this season.
He could have told you how, after

finished ball, working reverses, fake
or double, with a precision of mid

Eut - let this man go his way while

looked from the press box, where

entire game.
Forty-four strong, the youngsters
trotted onto the field for their initial
appearance under a cardinal ban
ner, and right away fans began to
wonder "are they heavy enough?"
They did look small.
But when the starting eleven took
the field for the kickoff, it looked
as though Bradshaw had concen
trated most of his beef in the first
string line, which was plenty hefty
for a freshman ball club.

Has, or hasn't, James "Rabbit"
Bradshaw the best yearling eleven
seen in these parts since the loudly
lamented "cut" of freshman registra
tion which paired down his turnout
possibilities some 30 per cent'.'
That's a fairly large order to fill,
probably one to be termed "ridicu
lous" by the skeptics who saw the
youngsters struggle four quarters
against a supposedly weak San
Francisco Teachers College team
last Saturday to gain nothing better
than a scoreless tie.
First Showing Good
But, on the other hand, if you
had been here a week ago to ask a
witness of the Marin J.C.-Indian
freshman contest of two Saturdays
past, the answer might very pos
sibly have been: "Well, perhaps he
has."
And to prove his point, this wit
ness could have gone on to cite the
37 to 0 score against a jaysee outfit
which was one of the strongest in
the bay region last year, and rated
as not so weak despite an entirely
new lineup this season.
He could have told you how, after
but three days of organized prac
tice, the babes went out to play
finished ball, working reverses, fake
or double, with a precision of mid
season quality.
Look Fairly Light
Eut - let this man go his way while
we describe how the Papcose eleven
looked from the press box, where
we were pleasantly rewarded for
arriving early enough to witness the
entire game.
Forty-four strong, the youngsters
trotted onto the field for their initial
appearance under a cardinal ban
ner, and right away fans began to
wonder "are they heavy enough?"
They did look small.
But when the starting eleven took
the field for the kickoff, it looked
as though Bradshaw had concen
trated most of his beef in the first
string line, which was plenty hefty
for a freshman ball club.
Mulier, Kahn at Ends
At ends were Mulier and Kahn,
weighing 160 and 170 pounds, re
spectively. Lettunich and Steiner,
tackles, loomed as two of the big
gest men on the squad, tipping the
beam at 193 and 180.
Guards were comparatively light,
but not exactly featherweights. Sem
melroth is listed at 174, while Mott
ram, on the other side, weighs 163
pounds. And the center position was
held down by some 195 pounds of
beef belonging to a young man
named Van Kirk.
In the backfield, the meat was
pretty well balanced, with a couple
of light halfbacks at about 153
pounds each, Beach and Kelley. Aj
might be expected in a Warner
style team, the weight in the back
field was carried by the quarter and
full, berths filled by Flannagan, 130,
and Moore, 177 pounds.
Line Functions Well
After the kickoff against Marin,
everyone settled back to see the un
practiced freshmen take a beating.
Imagine their surprise, then, when
that Papoose line began opening
holes right and left to let Beach and
Kelley slide off tackle or around the
ends.
And then this man Moore, who
hails from far-off lowa, began
smacking the line with power remi
niscent of Chuck Smalling. Flanna
gan, too, plunged through repeated
ly for substantial gains. The contest
turned into a rout, as one might
guess from the 37 to 0 count, and
the question became not who would
win, but who, exactly, did Bradshaw
have?
First, he has a couple of guards
that show plenty of promise. Both
Semmelroth and Mottram looked
good, but the latter showed like a
real star. More than one Marin punt
he blocked during the afternoon. His
home, by the way, is in San Fran
cisco, where he played bang-up prep
school ball for Mission High.
Center Job Filled
The center job and tackle berths
seemed satisfactorily filled by the
starters in this game, while Brad
shaw did quite a little shifting at
the wing positions.
Three men, Kahn, Mulier, and
Woolley, will probably have it out
between them for the end jobs, with
