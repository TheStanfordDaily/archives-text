PUNTS AND PUTTS
We have in our midst one Charles j
Seaver, who has dug divots on some !
of our very best courses, and with j
some of our most illustrious golfers. |
Last year Seaver blasted his way to j
the semi-finals of the National Ama- |
teur tourney, and this summer was j
regarded as the leading threat to ]
annex the crown abandoned by j
Bobby Jones.
Ho toured the difficult Beverly I
j course in 148 strokes, six over par, j
in the qualifying rounds to tie with j
; Yancy Yates of Princeton and John- I
ny Lehman of Chicago for medal |
honors, but was eliminated in the j
i second round by Yates by one hole.
I Following his defeat, it was noised |
! about that Chuck, who has been j
mixing football, basketball, and J
j even a little track with his golf, ,
would drop his other athletic aspira- j
j tions to concentrate on his links
play. !
Seaver, however, turned a deaf j
' ear to those who were attempting to j
I influence him, reported last week to
j Jimmy Bradshaw, frosh grid coach,
i and climbed into the moleskins. He
i appears a sweet fullback prospect, j
, and his punts will vie with his putts

for fame. His punts, incidentally,
often sail over fifty yards.

With Stanford and Minnesota
meeting in the first big inter
sectional clash of the year a
week from Saturday, we present
in another column the first of a
series of stories by members of
the Minnesota Daily sports staff,
who will dope the contest from
the Minnesota angle.
