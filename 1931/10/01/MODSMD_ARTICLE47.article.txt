# BASEBALL'S EXIT
## 
### 
Baseball, flaring up in a final blaze
of glory, will give undisputed place
to King Football following the close
of the world series, opening today
in St. Louis. Connie Mack, the
Knute Rockne of baseball, will be
seeking his third straight world title,
a feat yet unaccomplished, as his
Philadelphia Athletics clash with
the St. Louis Cardinals.
The Pacific Coast League will
drag things out a little longer, with
the regular season not closing until
next Sunday. The San Francisco
Seals, who did not get started in
the first half, seem to have the sec
ond half in the bag and will prob
ably meet Hollywood in the playoff
for the league title. Coming after
the world series, and in the middle
of football season, the series will al
most be an anticlimax. It will be
interesting, however, in that it may
again bring together Sam Gibson,
Seal hurling ace, and Shcllenbach,
Hollywood's veteran spitballer.
Lcn Kullman, sports editor of
the Daily last autumn, is now
grinding out copy for the San
Jose News, giving particular at
tention to Indian football.â€”L.M.C.
