# SOCCER PROSPECTS DARKENED BY LOSS OF VETERAN STARS
## 
### 
Facing the task of rebuilding a
soccer team without the services of
I nine lettermen of last year's aggre
| gation, Coach Harry Maloney never
theless presents the unusual spec-
I tacle of a coach who "looks forward
to a successful season."
Burns and Dalton, star fullbacks
i of the 1930 squad, are among the
missing, as are Captain Eberhart, in
j side left; Christensen, center half;
t Nichols, outside right; Reynolds,
j outside left, and Lynden, half, all
| regulars. Others lost to the team are
Edwards, fullback, and Lorton, half.
Maloney bases his hopes on a nu
i cleus of veterans, Captain Karl Falk,
Preston Plumb, and Jim Webster,
joined to much promising material
from the freshmen. Webster will be
at goal, Falk at inside right and
Plumb at halfback. Arthur Kearn,
| from the frosh, and Johnson, an
j other new man, will fill the impor
[ tant center forward post, while an
i old varsity man returning, Buster
I Holmes, is expected to help the full
back situation.
Work for both varsity and fresh
j man squads will begin tomorrow af
-1 ternoon, suits being issued' at 2 o'-
I clock in the gym and practice start
j ing at 4 on the soccer field.
Maloney has issued a call for frosh
| players to turn out at once. The
i yearlings will play two games with
' the California babes and will also
' meet Bay region high school teams,
i Practice will be held three times a
week.
