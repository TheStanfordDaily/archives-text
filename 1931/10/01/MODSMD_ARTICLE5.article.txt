# COMMERCE GROUP CONCLUDES RATE INCREASE HEARINGS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. (/Pi â€”
The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion today closed two months and a
half oi hearings on the railroads'
request for a 15 per cent freight
rate increase and took the case un
der advisement.
A decision is expected in three or
four weeks. The hearings ended
with rebuttal arguments by attor
neys for the railroads and railroad
security holders.
During the closing arguments
Grenville Clark of New York, rep
resenting security holders, told th'j
commission that a refusal to in
crease rates would* participate in
nation wide controversy on the
question of cutting railroad wages.
Clyde Brown, chief attorney for
the Now York Central, said that he
felt the commission had no alterna
tive under the transportation act
but to increase rates.
Referring to railroad wages,
Brown asked the commission to re
member that in 1922 when it re
duced railroad rates a cut in wages
of railroad employees was effected
on the same date.
The railroads filed their petition
for the increase on June 17 and on
July 15 hearings were started.
