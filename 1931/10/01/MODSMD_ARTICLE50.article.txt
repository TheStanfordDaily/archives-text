# GOPHER GRIDDERS START SATURDAY FOR INDIAN GAME
## Captain Munn Leads Grid Squad of Minnesota to Coast for Oct. 10 Filt 
### BY COURTNEY SWENSEN 
MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 30—Thirty
three Gopher football players,
among them seventeen lettermen,
are due to leave Minneapolis Sat
urday afternoon, October 3, after
the Minnesota-Oklahoma game en
route for Palo Alto, where they will
meet the Stanford eleven in the sec
ond of a two-game series scheduled
for 1930 and 1931.
Captained by Clarence Munn, a
guard and Minnesota's candidate for
All-American, the Gopher varsity
will engage Stanford with three
games and three weeks of practice
behind them. Minnesota made its
first appearance against North Da
kota and Ripon in a double-header,
winning both games. The Oklahoma
game Saturday will give the Gophers
one more trial before they take on
the highly touted Stanford team.
Many Vets on Squad
Despite a poor showing in the first
games, Minnesota has nearly the
same team that held Stanford to a
scoreless tie last year. Clarence
Munn, Bob Reihsen, veteran guards,
and Lloyd Stein, veteran guard, are
the main strength of the Maroon
and Gold forward wall.
Coach Fritz Crisler has been hav
ing trouble in developing some fast
ends who can cover the long punts
of Munn, who will again do most of
the kicking for Minnesota. Last sea
son he rated as one of the best
punters in the Western Conference.
Munn can also pass and run with
the ball just as effectively.
Pete Somers is the present quar
terback for Minnesota, though his
position is none too secure with My
Übl and Kenneth MacDougall push
ing him hard. MacDougall is cne
of the flashiest halfbacks in the
West. Weighing only 148 pounds, he
is one of the most elusive halves
seen at the university in some years.
Jack Manders, who was called by
many sports writers the hardest hit
ting fullback in the Big Ten last
year, is back to make trouble for
Maroon and Gold opponents.
