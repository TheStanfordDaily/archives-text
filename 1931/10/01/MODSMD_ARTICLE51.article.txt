# Indians Not Great But Good: Warner
## Team Stronger Than Last Season Says "Old Man"; Baker Lauded For Play Against Club 
### BY L.M. C 
"Not a GREAT team, but we have
the foundation of a pretty good ball
club."
That's the way "Pop" Warner
| sized up the gridiron situation yes
j terday in an exclusive interview
with the Daily sports editor.
"We will do at least as well as last
! year, and U.S.C. won't beat us so
I badily. In fact NO team will! This
j last emphatically, with a wry smile.
False Impression Given
Pop pointed out that when the In
dians ran rough-shod over the West
Coast Army eleven, 46 to 0, with
evei'ybody but the water boy get
ting into the game, a false impres
sion of great Stanford power was
given.
"That was corrected last Satur
day," he continued. "That game
showed us more nearly in our true
light."
Analyzing the strength and
weaknesses of the team in gen
eral, Warner pointed out:
1. The line is somewhat
stronger than last year.
2. Team spirit is excellent.
3. There is competition for
every post.
4. The two glaringly weak
| points apparent last spring, at
center and fullback, have not
yet been effectively plugged.
The great wealth of material for
almost every position, demonstrated
in the Army game, is not necessarily
an advantage, the Old Man pointed
out.
Coaching Efforts Divided
"We have a number of men of al
most equal ability for many posi
tions, especially halfbacks and ends,"
Warner said. "While this is an ad
vantage in producing competition, it
makes it impossible for the coaching
I staff to pick two teams and devote
most of its time to them. Instead,
our efforts are divided among a
greater number of men, and it prob
ably will not be possible to pick a
real first team until after the Min
nesota game."
Commenting on the backfield,
Warner said that the halfbacks give
him no cause for worry, but that
the two heavy-duty positions, quar
terback and fullback, are not as
i strong as he would desire.

He did laud Phil Buker, however, '
for the beautiful game he played
against the Olympic Club. Baker
played one of the finest defensive
games on the field Saturday, while j
he was always good for a gain when ,
he cracked the line.
"Right now he looks the best of
the lot," was Warner's comment. "Of
course," he added, "Captain Harry j
Hillman has not had a chance to ;
get in the best of condition."
Pop seemed a little disappointed
in the performance of Caddel. Ad
mitting Caddel would probably go i
j better at half than at full, Warner j
! pointed out that he was needed i
j badly at full, and not at half. I
! "Dusty" Allen, who, like Baker, was i
| a bright spot in the club game, drew |
favorable comment from Pop. .
Center Battle Close
j As for center, Warner said that
| Milligan and Marks are about a
I standoff. With more experience, they j
may develop into really good pivot
I men, although the center of the line |
is at the present time its weakest ;
point.
In general, Warner sized up the |
team as stronger than last year, and [
he appeared particularly gratified at j
the exceptionally fine spirit shown ,
by the squad.
