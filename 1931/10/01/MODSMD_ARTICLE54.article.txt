# Series Opens St. Louis
## GROVE – DERRINGER PITCHING DUEL IS BIG DRAWING CARD Weather Man Says Crowds Will Witness Pageant In Fair Weather 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 30. (A 3 ) — The
world series, baseball's big show and
one of the most picturesque pa
geants of American sport will he
launched tomorrow with prospects
of balmy weather, a capacity crowd
and a dramatic pitching duel be
tween Lefty Grove, ace of the world
champion Athletics, and Paul Der
ringer, freshman star of the St.
Louis Cardinals.
Good times or otherwise, the world
series annually commands a nation
al interest second to nothing else in
the country's sporting activity. This
year is no exception as the cham
pionship clubs of the American and
National leagues come to grips in
their struggle for diamond suprem
acy.
Seats Sold Out
Sportsman's Park has been sold
out for the first two games, so far
as reserved scats are concerned. A
crowd of nearly 40,000 is expected
to cheer Gabby Street's Cardinals
as they begin a fight to stop the
onrush of Connie Mack's machine,
one of the greatest in baseball his
tory.
The National League's gallant but
crippled forces enter the series
again as under-dogs, after four con
secutive and decisive setbacks at the
hands of their American League
rivals.
Even the enthusiasm of home town
supporters, the advantage of starting
on their own grounds, and the wide
spread admiration for Manager
Gabby Street failed tonight to cloak
the fact there is more hope than
conviction in the chances of the
Red Birds overthrowing the world
champions.
Odds on Athletics
The Athletics ruled 8 to 5 favor
ites to capture their third straight
crown and deservedly so, on the
record and "dope."
The American League's forces
have captured 10 ol the last 19 series
contests. If the Athletics triumph
again, they will set a new all-time
club record of three straight and a
league record of five consecutive
championships.
Cards Hit by Injuries
The Cardinals have lost their vet
eran right-hander, Jess Haines, for
the series. They probably will start
with a substitute, Andy High, at
third base instead of Earl (Sparky)
Adams, who twisted an ankle ten
days ago and is still hobbling.
They will have a semi-casualty in
center field, the youthful Pepper
Martin, who has a slightly damaged
leg. They will gamble in the box
with Paul Derringer, powerful
young right-hander with a remark
able first year record, but no pre
vious experience in world series
combat.
Street to Start Derringer
"We have survived a flock of dif
ficulties before and come out on
top," declared Street tonight. "We
have had some tough luck but it's
going to make my boys scrap that
much harder. I will start Derringer
and don't make any mistake about
him. He has the stuff to win. If he
does, just watch us."
This seemed to sum up the preva
lent feeling. Although nine out of
ten of the assembled experts pre
dicted a decisive victory for the
Athletics, they agreed the National
League champions would be hard
to stop if they get off to a winning
start behind Derringer.
Connie Mack, arriving this after
noon with his championship collec
tion of- stars, maintained his usual
reticence in discussing pitching
prospects.
Mack Will Use Aces
There was no reason, however, to
doubt he would again adopt the
orthodox system of rotating Robert
Moses Grove, greatest of modern
pitchers, and George Livingston
Earnshaw, right-handed hero of the
1930 battle. They won the series last
year, have had another great year,
and are primed to throw cm past
the Cardinals' sluggers again.
The series schedule offers an op
portunity for Mack to play his two
aces exclusively in the fifst four
games in an attempted cleanup, with
two days of travel and rest between
the second game here and the third
contest at Philadelphia next Mon
day.
Reserves May Help
He has the veteran Waite Hoyt, the
southpaw, Rube Walberg, and the
young right-hander, Roy Mahaffy,
for emergencies.
With Dib Williams, sensational
youngster, slated for the shortstop
berth he has clinched by his bril
liant work this season, the Athletics
will show the first change in the
lineup that won the scries in 1929
and 1930. Williams replaces the vet
eran Joe Boley, who has a bad leg.
Otherwise the Mackmen are in good
trim, including the erstwhile crip
ples, Haas, Foxx, and Dykes.
Italians drink about 500,000 bar
rels of boor a year.

With Dib Williams, sensational
youngster, slated for the shortstop

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 30. (A 3 ) — The
world series, baseball's big show and
one of the most picturesque pa
geants of American sport will he
launched tomorrow with prospects
of balmy weather, a capacity crowd
and a dramatic pitching duel be
tween Lefty Grove, ace of the world
champion Athletics, and Paul Der
ringer, freshman star of the St.
Louis Cardinals.
Good times or otherwise, the world
series annually commands a nation
al interest second to nothing else in
the country's sporting activity. This
year is no exception as the cham
pionship clubs of the American and
National leagues come to grips in
their struggle for diamond suprem
acy.
Seats Sold Out
Sportsman's Park has been sold
out for the first two games, so far
as reserved scats are concerned. A
crowd of nearly 40,000 is expected
to cheer Gabby Street's Cardinals
as they begin a fight to stop the
onrush of Connie Mack's machine,
one of the greatest in baseball his
tory.
The National League's gallant but
crippled forces enter the series
again as under-dogs, after four con
secutive and decisive setbacks at the
hands of their American League
rivals.
Even the enthusiasm of home town
supporters, the advantage of starting
on their own grounds, and the wide
spread admiration for Manager
Gabby Street failed tonight to cloak
the fact there is more hope than
conviction in the chances of the
Red Birds overthrowing the world
champions.
Odds on Athletics
The Athletics ruled 8 to 5 favor
ites to capture their third straight
crown and deservedly so, on the
record and "dope."
The American League's forces
have captured 10 ol the last 19 series
contests. If the Athletics triumph
again, they will set a new all-time
club record of three straight and a
league record of five consecutive
championships.
Cards Hit by Injuries
The Cardinals have lost their vet
eran right-hander, Jess Haines, for
the series. They probably will start
with a substitute, Andy High, at
third base instead of Earl (Sparky)
Adams, who twisted an ankle ten
days ago and is still hobbling.
They will have a semi-casualty in
center field, the youthful Pepper
Martin, who has a slightly damaged
leg. They will gamble in the box
with Paul Derringer, powerful
young right-hander with a remark
able first year record, but no pre
vious experience in world series
combat.
Street to Start Derringer
"We have survived a flock of dif
ficulties before and come out on
top," declared Street tonight. "We
have had some tough luck but it's
going to make my boys scrap that
much harder. I will start Derringer
and don't make any mistake about
him. He has the stuff to win. If he
does, just watch us."
This seemed to sum up the preva
lent feeling. Although nine out of
ten of the assembled experts pre
dicted a decisive victory for the
Athletics, they agreed the National
League champions would be hard
to stop if they get off to a winning
start behind Derringer.
Connie Mack, arriving this after
noon with his championship collec
tion of- stars, maintained his usual
reticence in discussing pitching
prospects.
Mack Will Use Aces
There was no reason, however, to
doubt he would again adopt the
orthodox system of rotating Robert
Moses Grove, greatest of modern
pitchers, and George Livingston
Earnshaw, right-handed hero of the
1930 battle. They won the series last
year, have had another great year,
and are primed to throw cm past
the Cardinals' sluggers again.

This seemed to sum up the preva
lent feeling. Although nine out of
ten of the assembled experts pre
dicted a decisive victory for the
Athletics, they agreed the National
League champions would be hard
to stop if they get off to a winning
start behind Derringer.
Connie Mack, arriving this after
noon with his championship collec
tion of- stars, maintained his usual
reticence in discussing pitching
prospects.
Mack Will Use Aces
There was no reason, however, to
doubt he would again adopt the
orthodox system of rotating Robert
Moses Grove, greatest of modern
pitchers, and George Livingston
Earnshaw, right-handed hero of the
1930 battle. They won the series last
year, have had another great year,
and are primed to throw cm past
the Cardinals' sluggers again.
The series schedule offers an op
portunity for Mack to play his two
aces exclusively in the fifst four
games in an attempted cleanup, with
two days of travel and rest between
the second game here and the third
contest at Philadelphia next Mon
day.
Reserves May Help
He has the veteran Waite Hoyt, the
southpaw, Rube Walberg, and the
young right-hander, Roy Mahaffy,
for emergencies.
With Dib Williams, sensational
youngster, slated for the shortstop
berth he has clinched by his bril
liant work this season, the Athletics
will show the first change in the
lineup that won the scries in 1929
and 1930. Williams replaces the vet
eran Joe Boley, who has a bad leg.
Otherwise the Mackmen are in good
trim, including the erstwhile crip
ples, Haas, Foxx, and Dykes.
Italians drink about 500,000 bar
rels of boor a year.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 30. (A 3 ) — The
world series, baseball's big show and
one of the most picturesque pa
geants of American sport will he
launched tomorrow with prospects
of balmy weather, a capacity crowd
and a dramatic pitching duel be
tween Lefty Grove, ace of the world
champion Athletics, and Paul Der
ringer, freshman star of the St.
Louis Cardinals.
Good times or otherwise, the world
series annually commands a nation
al interest second to nothing else in
the country's sporting activity. This
year is no exception as the cham
pionship clubs of the American and
National leagues come to grips in
their struggle for diamond suprem
acy.
Seats Sold Out
Sportsman's Park has been sold
out for the first two games, so far
as reserved scats are concerned. A
crowd of nearly 40,000 is expected
to cheer Gabby Street's Cardinals
as they begin a fight to stop the
onrush of Connie Mack's machine,
one of the greatest in baseball his
tory.
The National League's gallant but
crippled forces enter the series
again as under-dogs, after four con
secutive and decisive setbacks at the
hands of their American League
rivals.
Even the enthusiasm of home town
supporters, the advantage of starting
on their own grounds, and the wide
spread admiration for Manager
Gabby Street failed tonight to cloak
the fact there is more hope than
conviction in the chances of the
Red Birds overthrowing the world
champions.
Odds on Athletics
The Athletics ruled 8 to 5 favor
ites to capture their third straight
crown and deservedly so, on the
record and "dope."
The American League's forces
have captured 10 ol the last 19 series
contests. If the Athletics triumph
again, they will set a new all-time
club record of three straight and a
league record of five consecutive
championships.
Cards Hit by Injuries
The Cardinals have lost their vet
eran right-hander, Jess Haines, for
the series. They probably will start
with a substitute, Andy High, at
third base instead of Earl (Sparky)
Adams, who twisted an ankle ten
days ago and is still hobbling.
They will have a semi-casualty in
center field, the youthful Pepper
Martin, who has a slightly damaged
leg. They will gamble in the box
with Paul Derringer, powerful
young right-hander with a remark
able first year record, but no pre
vious experience in world series
combat.
Street to Start Derringer
"We have survived a flock of dif
ficulties before and come out on
top," declared Street tonight. "We
have had some tough luck but it's
going to make my boys scrap that
much harder. I will start Derringer
and don't make any mistake about
him. He has the stuff to win. If he
does, just watch us."
This seemed to sum up the preva
lent feeling. Although nine out of
ten of the assembled experts pre
dicted a decisive victory for the
Athletics, they agreed the National
League champions would be hard
to stop if they get off to a winning
start behind Derringer.
