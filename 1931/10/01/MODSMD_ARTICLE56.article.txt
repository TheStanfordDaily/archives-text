### DICK RODDA 
With the e/Tecl of graduation upon
the personnel of the 1932 Card track
squad more than offset by the abun
dance of material coming up from
last season's frosh team, Dink Tem
pleton's chances of overcoming the
two-point margin that prevented
Stanford from winning the 1.C.4-A.
meet last spring, are exceptionally
hopeful.
This was indicated yesterday by
Assistant Track Coach Bill Elling
ton, who named more than a dozen
new prospects, all of whom he pre
dicts will be fighting for places in
| the 1932 1.C.4-A. meet at Berkeley.
"The Cards will be as good if not
i better than last year," declared El
! lington. "I am especially pleased
I with the turnout of the sophomores.
! "John Lyman, sensational shot
j putter from Santa Monica, is fore
j most among the second-year men,"
j Ellington continued. "There are also
Williams and Reppy in the broad
I jump, Packard in the hurdles,!
Owens and Meirs in the high jump,
Kantzer in the javelin, Van Dell'en
| and Edmonds in the vault, Handke,
Amdahl, \zevedo, and Burch in the
| distance races, and Murphy in the
| 440."
| Fall track practice will begin next
Monday afternoon with suits to be
j issued Friday and Saturday of this
week. Each week's training will be
concluded by a practice meet run in
j three-fourths distances.
Podge Smith, Hec Dyer, and Bob
i Brown will he missed next year.
Because of injuries, however, Smith
: and Dyer were unable to place in

| the 1.C.4-A., and therefore the men
| who made Stanford's total score in
| last May's 1.C.4-A. are returning al
most intact.
