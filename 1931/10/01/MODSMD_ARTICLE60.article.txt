I BERKELEY, Sept. CO (/?).-■ Ccnch J
j Bill Ingram has named the Calnor- '
nia players who will start the game I
against the flashy St. Mary's team
next Saturday, but how long theso
I fellows will stay in the lineup de
j pends upon how well they do.
I If the game is as hard fought as
\ that one at Los Angeles last Satur
! day, many men on both teams will
! see action. These men will start for i
California:
Left end—Water bury
Left tackle—Ransomc
Left guard—Carlson
Ccntc r—MLedanich
Right guard—r.lcArthur
Right tackle—Tozier
Right end—Di fiesta
Quarterback —Stewart
Left halfback—Watkins
Right halfback—East
Fullback—Castro
Captain Ed Griffith, a halfback,
j who is being trained as a fullback; j
; Rusty Gill, first strins| fullback last
| year; Valianes, a last running half- i
i back and a good kicker and passer; i
McCutcheon, a halfback of consider- ;
able experience; Fritehi, a hard
fighter; Smith and Potter, quarter
backs, are others who may be called
on. It is believed it will take the ;
full strength of the company to
stand off the fast, tricky, hard tight- |
ing crew from St. Mary's, so all ;
hands will be on deck when the ;
'starting whistle blows.
