# NOTED AUSTRALIAN ONE-TIME CHAMPION RETURNS TO FARM

### 
i Recognized as one of the leading '
j figures in Australia's new oil devel- I
| opments, Henry C. Lyne, '12, has j
i been visiting on the campus since j
' his arrival in the United States four j
I days ago.
The engineer has been renewing -
! old acquaintances at Stanford dur- ,
I ing his stay here, among them being
j Harry Maloney and Professor Wal
ter J. Crook. Under Maloney's tute
lage he won the University's heavy- j
weight boxing championship and ]
. excelled at fencing, while his friend- i
| ship with the latter dates back to
i the time they both arrived in the
1 United States from Australia to en-
I roll as Stanford students.
Lyne is general manager of the
South Australian Oil Company. As
i representative of his company, he is
|in the United States seeking aid
| from American oil concerns for the
j development of his country's here
i tofore unknown mineral wealth. The
: first discovery of oil in Australia
i was made last year about 200 miles
: from Melbourne by Lyne.
"Australia's consumption of gas
' and oil amounts to $90,000,000 annu
ally," declared Lyne. "American
! companies have been exporting to
! Australia for years, and paying a
' duty of 25 cents a gallon. United
j States capital could develop the new
i oil lands and sell the product with
i out the expenses of exporting or
| paying duty."
Lack of home capital has pre
! vented his company from making
i further explorations, Lyne ex
plained, and the Australian govern
j ment, striving to balance an uneven
budget, has been unable to render
aid.
