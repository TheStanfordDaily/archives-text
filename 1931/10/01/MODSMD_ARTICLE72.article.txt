# MALE FROSH ADOPT EMPRESS EUGENIE'S OFFICIAL HEADGEAR
## 
### 
ATCHISON, Kas., Sept. 30.—The
Empress Eugenie hats, like the bi
j cycle, and the corkscrews, appear
I to be here to stay. Only this week
! freshmen of St. Benedict's College
| here have adopted the "Eugenics"
j as official headgear.
The lrosh lids are ornamented
j with a "chicken sprig" and are worn
| rakishly over one eye. They are
j made by taking a tuck in a "beany"
i and letting the prow stick out in
| front. This gives a finger grip for
j doffing when upperclass men appear,
; and also lends a distingue air to
| many ensembles otherwise devoid of
j anything in particular.
Patrick McCann of St. Louis, frosh
| president, and his girl friend intro
! duced the new "cock-eyed chapeau"
j to the campus, and the ripple was
J felt almost as far West as Kalama
! zoo, which is East anyhow. Oh yes,
j the natty plume is purple and white
j —until it gets dirty, when it is
| huckleberry-brindle. It is felt that
i the new hat helps the cause of edu
| cation mightily.
