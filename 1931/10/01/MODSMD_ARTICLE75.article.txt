# SCIENTISTS EXPECT DECLINE IN SUPPLY OF AMERICAN GOLD
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (TP).—An
ebb tide in the steady stream of gold
flowing from domestic mines to
America's well-filled coffers in the
next decade is expected by scien
tists.
Troubles of Great Britain, Swe
den, and Norway and other gold
standard nations have revived dis
cussion here among geologists and
mineralogists of this country's fu
ture raw gold supply.
Although none of the experts
would venture a flat prediction, all
held to the theory that future dis
coveries would be negligible v/hile
existing fields slowly would be ex
hausted.
Production has now declined to
slightly more than 2,000,000 ounces
annually.
Officials of the Geological Survey
cited a report by the gold delega
tion of the League of Nations finan
cial committee in 1930 as probably
the most accurate estimate of Amer
ica's future production.
Prepared largely by the Geologi
cal Survey with the co-operation of
the Bureau of Mines, the report es
timates this country's output until
1940 will remain at an average of
2,000,000 ounces.
