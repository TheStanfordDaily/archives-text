WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (/Pi.—
This last day of September, the ev<#
of widespread pay cuts taking ef
fect, confronted the administration
with fresh evidence on the wage
question as well as trade conditions
and unemployment.
Some encouragement was drawn
from indications of business im
provement, helping to offset the
story statistics told of decreased
work and compensation paid.
Curtailed operation schedules
were noticed particularly in auto
mobile, iron, steel, and radio 2->lants.
Improvement took place in New
England textile mills, as well as silk
mills in the middle Atlantic district.
Awake to the extent of wage
flashes effective tomorrow, the ad
ministration held to a course of "si
lent watchfulness. Aside from Sec
retary Doak's assertion, "It is de
plorable but apparently it could not
be avoided," no position has been
taken publicly on the instances of
thinning the pay envelopes.
