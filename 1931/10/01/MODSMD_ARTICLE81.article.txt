# HETCH-HETCHY DAM PROJECT OFFICIALS FLAYED BY EX-MAYOR
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30 (#>).—A
charge that sabotage by certain offi
cials has prevented completion of
the Hetch-Hetchy project in central
California was voiced today by
Louis Bartlett, former Berkeley
mayor, at the national convention
of the Public Ownership League of
America.
Bartlett's charge followed a speech
by Franklin Hichborn, San Fran
cisco, who called upon California
residents to defend themselves from
a power company trust he said
threatened to establish a statewide
water and power monopoly.
Resolutions urging Congress and
President Hoover to place Muscle
Shoals project in full operation and
proposing the expansion and in
creased patronage of the postal sav
ings banks were expected to be
acted upon later in the day.
'"San Francisco has acquired a
water distribution system, but buys
half its water from the East Bay
cities, Bartlett said. "It generates
power but has no power distribu
tion system and it must float an
other bond issue of $4,000,000 to get
water and $80,000,000 to distribute
it."
Hichborn said power companies
are seeking to use California to de
velop water and propose to take any
power the residents may develop
and sell it back to consumers at
monopoly rates.
