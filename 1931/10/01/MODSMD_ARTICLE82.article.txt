WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. I/Pi â€”
'Secretary Hyde today reiterated the
Administration's opposition to an ex
port debenture in an effort to stimu
late foreign purchasing of Ameri
crn cotton.
Cables from a conference of the
T'uropean Cotton Association at
Liverpool led the secretary to be
lieve foreign buyers "generally re
gard debentures and similar masures
as calculated to depress prices of
American cotton at European ports
still further."
So he dispatched a message to the
association, saying, '"It is inconceiv
able lhat Con;i; ss would take any
action the benefits of which would
accrue to the buyers rather than
the produce is of American cotton."
Park benches have been con
structed that have backs which un
fold to form picnic tables.
