They reached their goal, these three plucky fliers who tool; off
from Portugal on a flight to New York, but what a week of horror they
experienced doing it. They were miraculously rescued off the New
foundland coast by a passing ship after clinging to their wrecked plane
for 158 hours. The three are shown here holding a reunion in a New
York hotel. Left to right: Christian Johancsen, Fernando Costa Viega
and Willy Rody.
