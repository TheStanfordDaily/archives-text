Men's Hosiery — The Brand and Style You Prefer
A rugged shoe for men
--The Ski
Built big to give foot comfort (and foot mile
age) like you've never enjoyed before. Inci
dentally the narrow toe is quite "right" this
season.
Ski comes in Martins Brown Zugg imported
grain leather with triple sole to heel water
proof. And English made.
FOR COLLEGE MEN
AND OTHERS
We are showing many handsome styles in
both smooth and grain leathers in a wide
range of prices from $5.00 to $12.50.
You'll like them—or we miss our guess.
