# PRESIDENT, AIDS PARLEY ON U.S. BUSINESS STATE
## Gold Characterized Best Money Base By U.S. Administration SEEK NEW SOLUTION English Silver Standard Thought Temporary 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (/P>. —
Seeking new pathways toward bet
ter business, President Hoover called
to his side today five aids who hold
strategic posts in the offensive
against topsy-turvy economics.
One by one they sat by his desk,
in (his order: Under Secretary Mills
of the Treasury, Governor Meyer of
the Federal* Reserve Board, Secre
taries Lamont and Stimson of the
Commerce and State Departments,
and J. C. Roop, Director of the Bud
get Bureau. A variety of domestic
problems figured in the conferences.
A little later authoritative word was
given that the President had some
thing in mind concerning a new ef
fort to better the situation.
Agitation for Silver
The administration sees no rea
son for tampering with this coun
try's gold standard or the return to
bi-metaallism. In official circles such
agitation as is going forward for a
return to bi-metallism was described
as coming chiefly from Senators
representing silver-producing states.

Gold was characterized as the
most satisfactory base for the coun
try's monetary system and tho tem
porary abandonment of the gold
base by Great Britain and several
other European countries was re
garded as not reflecting a perma
nent policy.
Gold Plentiful in U.S
The United States, with its cof
fers containing more gold than any
other country in the world, was de
scribed as having no reason to aban
don the gold standard.
The President is relying heavily
on the Budget Bureau in his insis
tence on keeping government ap
propriations down this winter. Col
onel Roop's office is engaged in go
ing over departmental estimates of
funds the departments want fov
1933. The Interior Department al
ready has reduced its budget esti
mate's for 1933 by $8,000,000.
Although the Commerce Depart
ment this year had $54,335,000 for
1932-33, the figure asked is less than
$50,000,000.
The next appropriation will con
tain only about $1,000,000 for the
Census Bureau, still operating on
what is left of the $39,000,000 origi
nally appropriated for the census.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (/P>. —
Seeking new pathways toward bet
ter business, President Hoover called
to his side today five aids who hold
strategic posts in the offensive
against topsy-turvy economics.
One by one they sat by his desk,
in (his order: Under Secretary Mills
of the Treasury, Governor Meyer of
the Federal* Reserve Board, Secre
taries Lamont and Stimson of the
Commerce and State Departments,
and J. C. Roop, Director of the Bud
get Bureau. A variety of domestic
problems figured in the conferences.
A little later authoritative word was
given that the President had some
thing in mind concerning a new ef
fort to better the situation.
Agitation for Silver
The administration sees no rea
son for tampering with this coun
try's gold standard or the return to
bi-metaallism. In official circles such
agitation as is going forward for a
return to bi-metallism was described
as coming chiefly from Senators
representing silver-producing states.

Gold was characterized as the
most satisfactory base for the coun
try's monetary system and tho tem
porary abandonment of the gold
base by Great Britain and several
other European countries was re
garded as not reflecting a perma
nent policy.
Gold Plentiful in U.S
The United States, with its cof
fers containing more gold than any
other country in the world, was de
scribed as having no reason to aban
don the gold standard.
The President is relying heavily
on the Budget Bureau in his insis
tence on keeping government ap
propriations down this winter. Col
onel Roop's office is engaged in go
ing over departmental estimates of
funds the departments want fov
