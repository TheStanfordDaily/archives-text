## 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 1 (/P). â€”Sent
to this country on the strange mis-
I sion of locating lost dialects, two
J representatives of a Norwegian uni
! versity are interviewing people of
Norwegian descent in Minnesota and
Wisconsin communities. *
It is the belief of Dr. Didrik Arup
1 Seip and Professor Ernst W. Selmer
of the University of Oslo that pe
-1 culiarities of their tongue, long since
! forgotten by their own people, still
! are preserved in much their original
state by descendants of immigrants
to this country 100 years ago,
The two phonetics experts already
have found twenty different dialects,
jof which they have made phono
! graph records, to be taken back to
' Norway and preserved for future
1 stvidy.
