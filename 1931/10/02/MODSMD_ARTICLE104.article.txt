# WESTERN STATES MAY THROW 1932 VOTING TO HOUSE
## "Favorite Sons" Seen As Possible Presidential Race Candidates 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 1. (/P) — j
Rumblings of a new presidential |
movement in the western states j
reached Capitol Hill today. The poli- 1
tical independents of thnt section i
have a unique proposal that presi
dential electors who are committed
to no candidate be chosen.
By such a plan, fostered in 25 ;
states, they believe the election of j
the next president would be thrown j
into the House of Representatives. ,
A majority of the electoral votes is ;
necessary for the election of a j
president.
Northwest Aid Seen
The scheme apparently springs j
from the northwestern states whose
senators grouped together last ses
sion in opposition to the tariff and ,
farm relief policies of President
Hoover. Independent electors —if (
elected—would be free to vote for
any man for president and their
candidate would be open to choice
in the voting of the House.
"Favorite Sons"'
The scheme fits in, to some extent, j
with embryo plans to put up "fa
vorite son" presidential candidates
in some western states.
Leaders of the Senate Republican
Independents who have been in lre
quent opposition to President Hoo
ver have refused to sanction a third
party. The Independent electors pro
posal is understood to be the alter
native step of those wishing a third
party. None of the leaders of the
Republican Independents so far has
stepped forward in opposition to
President Hoover for the Republican
nomination. Senator Brookhart, Re
publican, of lowa, however, has sug
gested half a dozen possible 4'Pro
gressive" presidential candidates in
cluding Senators Borah of Idaho,
Johnson of California, Norris of Ne
braska, and LaFollette of Wisconsin,
and Governor Pinchot of Pennsyl
vania.

Senator Borah returned to the
Capital today from the West but de
clined to discuss politics although
he did assert it was necessary for
the Republicans to organize a con
structive and aggressive program.
