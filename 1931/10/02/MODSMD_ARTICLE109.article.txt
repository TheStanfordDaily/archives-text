# Roughs Down Apple Vendor Rumba Proves Effective When Slugs Fail Miller Turns Master Mind
## 
### 
Apple vendors have invaded the
Stanford campus.
The first one was stationed at Se
! quoia yesterday. There is nothing
i shabby or poignant, nothing sugges-
I tive of the "unemployed" about the
! fruit merchant. It is a green, glass
1 machine. You put in a nickel and an
I apple drops out.
Sequoia roughs eyed the device
' with pleasure and awe. Here was
| something for them to play with.
I Something with which to lest their
j ingenuity.
Pennies, telephone slugs, and milk
i checks were ressurected. They were
! dropped in by the score. But they
! came right out again. The machine
i was "rough-proof." The roughs were
stumped. Art Miller, student body
vice-president, was consulted.
"Why not try the Rumba on it," he
suggested.
j "Hola! The Rumba!" shrieked the
I denizens of Sequoia.

They took the machine and turned
it upside down. They shook it to the
right- One . . . two . . . three . . .
four . . . They shook it to the left.
One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . .
They shook it up and down, und
back, and forth. They shook it again.
They soon had it shaking like a fen
der on an old Model T Ford. The air
was charged and tense with a spirit
of suspense.
Plunk! A rosy, red cheeked apple
dropped out.
j The machine had pulled a Frank
; enstein- It had betrayed its own cre
ator, its own master.
The roughs had succeeded. Rau
; cous, rousing cheers smote the raft
ers. It was the same thrill that a
| chicken must experience when it lays
its first egg.
Now they're patiently waiting for
I the installation of a mechanical pea
nut vendor. They want to see what
I affect the Rumba will have on it.
