# GREATER EFFORTS NEEDED IN FIGHT ON INSECT PESTS
## 
### 
Man is lighting a losing battle
against the ravages of insects and
other pests at the present time, in
dicates Professor Rennie W. Doane
ol the Stanford zoology department
in a recently published book called
"Common Pests."'
The annual loss by pests, many of
which affect man only in an in
direct manner, is estimated at al
most one and one-quarter billions of
dollars. This loss increases every
year, according to Professor Doane,
and ever greater efforts must be put
forth in our attempts to control
them.

Doane points out that one-half of
the pests in America have been im
ported from foreign countries and
distributed about the country by the
facility of modern methods of trans
portation. It often happens that in
sects and other forms of pest life
are not particularly harmful in their
native habitat but cause a great
deal of damage when removed to a
new environment.
The lxsok "Common Pests" has
been written in the popular style
and gives an interesting discussion
of all types of pests affecting farms,
gardens, homes, and individuals;
with special emphasis upon those
occurring in this vicinity.
Charles C. Thomas of Springfield,
