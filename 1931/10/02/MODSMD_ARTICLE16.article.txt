: fourth annual meeting here today,
considered problems concerning ad

President Leonard B. Slosson of
Los Angeles opened the meeting to
day with an address on the status
of the legal profession in California.
Relatively few of the 12,000 mem

guilty of unethical conduct, but en
forcement of the bar's regulations
against these few has proved diffi
cult, particularly in the smaller
communities.
