THAT SEAGULL STEEPED IN
SIN AND ALL HIS SLIMY
SYCOPHANTS
By Bleateroncame, the Younger
WORD HAS BEEN passed around j
j that that hitherto furtive and des- I
! picable den of dopes, the Stanford ,
Daily, lias dared to appear in the :
i same telephone directory as that in |
which is inscribed in gilt letters |
| the glorious name of the Hammer
| and Coffin Society.
THEREFORE, on behalf of the I
Old Boy and his sons, I beg leave
i at this point to say FAUGH! sirs
' (sometimes spelled FAUGH!), and
to say that we smell a rat, we see it j
! floating in the air, but mark you,
gentlemen, WE WILL NIP IT IN
I THE DUD!

j SO, THEREFORE, we are chal
-1 lenging these pusillanimous persons |
!of putrid perspicacity and preten- I
| sions to gird themselves for a grue- j
| somely gory "gigantic" upon the |
j gridiron.
PUBLICLY, before the Crowd as- j
' sembled in the Stadium on the tenth
|of this month, we will burst and
! botch that bubble sometimes known
i as the Dippy.
WE DARE YOU, you upstarts, to
j come forth to battle against the
i Knights of the Silver Sledge, and
I unless you reply to this challenge
| forthwith you will be branded by
: the world as the obnoxious order of
'■ ossified ostriches that you are. Until j
j your reply we will simply say, i
1 FAUGH! sirs, FAUGH!
