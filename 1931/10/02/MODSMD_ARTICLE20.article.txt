## Federation of Labor Seeks Volstead Modification As Workers Aid 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 1. (/P)—Definite
j steps to obtain modification by Con
i gress of the prohibition law will be
taken at the fifty-first annual na
j tional convention of the American
Federation of Labor, next week in
Vancouver, 8.C., President William
H. Green said here today.
Green, on his way to Vancouver,
i said the Federation will "emphatic
| ally reaffirm'" its stand for modifi
cation of the Volstead act to permit
! the sale of beer containing 2.75 per
! cent alcohol.
Will Fight Pay Cuts
I The Federation will go on record
also, Green announced, against wage
I cuts and for allocation of idle work
j ers to public and private jobs as
"temporary relief in an acute situa
tion."
Expressing belief there had been a
decided change in public opinion on
the prohibition question, Green said
| the Federation is "planning to call
| upon its friends in Congress to sup
j port legislation to bring about modi
j fication."
Repeal Not Asked
"The Federation is firmly con
; vinced modification of the Volstead
I act will serve to promote true tem
perance," the labor head added.
"Modification is necessary to help
economic conditions throughout the
nation by stimulating production
enterprises in many lines—recon
j struction of breweries, greater de
mand for farm products and by
j stimulating transportation."
Repeal of the eighteenth amend
' mentis not urged by the Federation,
Green said.
Sees Work Aid
Turning to wage reductions, Green
1 said: "They add to the seriousness
of an already serious situation."
"We l'eel that in the present emer
j gency, corporations should find other
: means to economize than by attack
i ing the wage structure," the labor
i president said. "The work should
be distributed among all men to
keep them as consumers in the mar
! ket.

"The consuming market of the na
j tion, which is made up mainly of
the working classes, is influenced
1 by fear, which is bad psychology.
! They are afraid of the banks; afraid
jof losing their jobs; afraid their
wages will be reduced.

Scorns Red Peril
j "The working men are refusing to
J buy, the idle can not buy. The great
■ consuming power of the nation can
! not be restored until the fear is
i gone."
Green said he did not believe
communism was a menace in the
1 United States at present . "The
American Federation of Labor is a
; bulwark against communism, and as
' long as the federation functions there
j need be no fear," he said.
