WASHINGTON, Oct. 1. </P> â€” A
belief that new military activities
should not be undertaken during the
depression was voiced today by Ma
jor General William G. Everson,
soldier-pastor, in resigning as chief
of the Militia Bureau to return to
the pulpit.
The view conformed with previous
expressions by high War Depart
ment and administration representa
tives.
"Never was the National Guard
more thoroughly organized, equipped
and trained than it is today,'" said
General Everson in his letter of
resignation.
