# WARNER PLANS 'IN STRIDE' WIN FROM BRONCOS
## Stanford Team To Maintain Average Strength In Lineup For Tilt BRONC RESERVES WEAK Paglia's Punting To Feature Santa Clara Attack 
### Lowell Cox 
In stride.
That is the way "Pop" Warner will
attempt to stop Santa Clara tomor
row, when the Indians and the
Broncos meet in their annual game.
For most of the student body, it
will be the first glimpse of the 1931
WaiTier machine in action, and it
will be the first intercollegiate game
of the season for the team.
The situation in brief:
1. Stanford will not present
maximum power against the
Broncos at any point in the
game, Warner electing to main
tain average strength through
out.
2 Santa Clara will make a
determined bid to win from t\e
opening whistle.
15. Superior man power, in
point of numbers, favors Stan
ford.
4. Santa Clara, following a
great game against California
last Saturday, is conceded a
chance to upset a Stanford team
which has looked far from bril
liant in practice this week.
Twice, in the last four years, the
Broncos swooped down on the cam
pus to upset Indian elevens which
failed to take the little mission col
lege seriously enough. Pointing for
the game, which Stanford is always
forced to take more or less in stride,
Santa Clara is always formidable,
and more so than ever this seasd .
"Make no mistake about that Cali
fornia-Santa Clara game last week,"
was Pop Warner's comment this
week. "Our scouts report that it was
not so much a question of California
weakness as Santa Clara strength
which had the Berkeley team on the
defensive for a large part of the
game."
Look for the Broncs to put up a
great scrap in the first half. Greater
Stanford man power should assert
itself in the second.
It is a certainty, however, that the
Indians will have to take the fray
more seriously than Wednesday
night's scrimmage, when most of the
squad gave only mild exhibitions.
Relaxation for a moment or two,
and an under - dog Bronc eleven
might write another early season
upset into the books.

Yesterday's workout was unevent
j ful, with Warner sending the squad
through only light practice, devoting
much of the short session to black
board work and signal practice

It is believed that for offense the
i Broncos will rely on the brilliant
I punting of Paglia to drive the In

Keep an eye on little Morey, the
Clipper's prize quarterback. He was

of the season for the team.
The situation in brief:
1. Stanford will not present
maximum power against the
Broncos at any point in the
game, Warner electing to main
tain average strength through
out.
2 Santa Clara will make a
determined bid to win from t\e
opening whistle.
15. Superior man power, in
point of numbers, favors Stan
ford.
4. Santa Clara, following a
great game against California
last Saturday, is conceded a
chance to upset a Stanford team
which has looked far from bril
liant in practice this week.
Twice, in the last four years, the
Broncos swooped down on the cam
pus to upset Indian elevens which
failed to take the little mission col
lege seriously enough. Pointing for
the game, which Stanford is always
forced to take more or less in stride,
Santa Clara is always formidable,
and more so than ever this seasd .
"Make no mistake about that Cali
fornia-Santa Clara game last week,"
was Pop Warner's comment this
week. "Our scouts report that it was
not so much a question of California
weakness as Santa Clara strength
which had the Berkeley team on the
defensive for a large part of the
game."
Look for the Broncs to put up a
great scrap in the first half. Greater
Stanford man power should assert
itself in the second.
It is a certainty, however, that the
Indians will have to take the fray
more seriously than Wednesday
night's scrimmage, when most of the
squad gave only mild exhibitions.
Relaxation for a moment or two,
and an under - dog Bronc eleven
might write another early season
upset into the books.
