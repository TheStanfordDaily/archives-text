# ILLEGAL RUSHING? YOU BET!

### 
The entrance of the class of \T> reawakens that age-old
problem pigeon-holed since lasl spring illegal rushing.
Throughout the year inanv long and weighty discussions
will occupy the time of the interfralernitv council and new
schemes will he devised to protect (he guileless freshmen
from the grasping designs of the row men, who, one would
think from the hubbub raised, stalk, bloodhound-like,
about tlie campus nightly hot on the spoor of a nugget.
Perhaps, out of the interfraternity council harangues

will spring a new system superior to the one now in use ;
and, also perhaps, they will prove as fruitless as those of!
past years. However, Tm: Daily believes that the present]
rushing system is better than any that have been so far
proposed or used by other universities.
The solution to this rushing problem is merely to main
lain the system as it has been in the past. In other words,
keep pre-season rushing illegal, but do not try to abolish
this pre-season rushing altogether. It sounds like a para-j
dox but illegal rushing is a direel benefit to both freshmen
and fraternities, but only so long as it is kept illegal.
Why throw up our hands in maiden-like horror at the |
thought of sueh a practice? Illegal rushing is beneficial 1
and is the only way in which a practical application of the.j
present system, which in theory condemns it. can be
worked out.
It' there were no illegal rushing and the rules laid down
by the inlerfraternitv council were strictly followed, im
agine the confusion, the melee that would occur in the
spring when, in three short weeks, freshmen and fraternity
men, virtual strangers, attempted to decide the all-impor
lant question of living companions for the following three
years. It would be little better than the system at California
where freshmen pledge a house practically without seeing
the rest of the campus.
Although pre-season rushing is essential, that does not
mean that rules and restrictions should be abolished and
rushing carried on openly throughout the year, for then the
benefits of the system as it is would be destroyed. One of
the best, if not the best, years that a student in this uni
versity spends is that one in Encina Hall with the rest of
his class. That is the main, if not sole, end of the deferred
rushing systemâ€”to keep the class together as a class and
not permit its immediate breaking up into small and prac
tically isolated groups.
Were rushing legal at any time, this advantage would
be lost and the freshmen, even though they continued to
maintain their rooms in Kncina, would spend all of their
time at their various houses.
Thus it is up to the council, not to search for a new
system or to curtail illegal rushing entirely, but merely to
make the rules stringent enough and inflict just enough
penalties to keep this pre-season rushing illegal. If this is
done, all the benefits of the system will be enjoyed and
none of its detriments incurrd.
