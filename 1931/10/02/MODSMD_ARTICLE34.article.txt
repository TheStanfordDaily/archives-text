# PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
## 
### 
In ninnv parts of the state, especially in the agricultural
sections, there has come to he during the past two years
considerable agitation looking to public ownership of the
water and power utilities.
The power corporations have assumed the proportions
of gigantic trusts controlled by small groups. So intricate
and efficient have become these organizations that the
slightest hint of public ownership is met with floods of
propaganda calling attention to a situation fraught with
danger from graft and corruption. Employes of the power
corporations take active part in service clubs, in civic af
fairs, and in politics; and their allegiance to the policies of
the corporation is an economic necessity.
Thus the influence wielded bv these organizations is
growing steadily.
Palo Alto lias become an outstanding example of the
successful operation of public ownership of utilities in
California. Many other cities have effected material sav
ings by virtue of the revenues collected; some cities have
even dispensed with taxation and are able to carry on city
affairs with money from this source.
Public utility corporations are in business for profit,
and owing to their monopolistic character, their rates of
return must be regulated by law. This amounts virtually to
a guaranteed return on the investment! And there is no
stimulation to lower costs of production and distribution.
In spile of the regulatory laws, the state railroad com
mission in April had to force the power companies to give
back an amount of -f()(>0,000 to consumers of power, which
amount was in excess of the lawful return on investment.
Public ownership is still an experiment,' but il seems
logical to expect its ultimate success.
