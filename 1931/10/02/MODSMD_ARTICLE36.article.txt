# BULL SESSION
## EUGENIE MOVES IN ON ROW AND ROBLE 
### 
No one seriously denies that these
Empress Eugenie hats are the most
comical and amusing creations that
the female world has yet bowed
down to in recent times. The fact
that 4 out of 5 women look absurd
in these bonnets is not very impor
tant; that question only concerns
the four. The problem that interests
the masses, however, is why the
four out of five look like they do,
and even still more important why
the fifth can command that saucy,
savoire-faire appearance by drop
ping a Robin Hood cap on the side
of her pretty little head.
The answer is close at hand. The
reason why these hats cause loud
guffaws from the natural and half
muffled giggles from the more polite
is their irritating incongruity. The
Eugenie bonnet is essentially coy
and demure;'and just such sur
roundings are necessary to make the
Eugonie seem natural However,
this new headgear clashes most hu
morously with masculine-cut leather
jackets, sport oxfords, and a rugged
and healthy complexion.
Dainty thin ankles, fragile clothes,
the ability to blush at will and a
slightly undernourished appearance
are the qualities that will put the
Eugenie over. The so-called modern
type that smokes hard, drives fast,
moves with determined stride, and
is a "regular"' fellow, should fight

I shy of the new chapeaux. It is a
| sorry situation, indeed. For years
| womankind has been throwing off
j so-called shackles and approaching
1 (so they thought) a single standard
j and all that sort of thing.
And now, the men designers with
I a snap of the fingers are seeking to
{force woman back into her former
] position. Because it is a fact that
either the Eugdnie must go or the
: gum-chewing, fiat-heeled, girl must
i change to the type that fits with
i the new hats. There is no mid
i course.
The suffragette works on the the-
I ory that woman was born free and
! everywhere man had # put her in
' chains. By slow and painful steps,
J she was freed from the chains that
| bound her till with the end of the
' Great War and the initiation of
| women into the vote and into busi-
I ness and into Reno, she stood—"The
! Emancipated Woman." What good
j did it do her? Men stopped taking
I off hats in the elevator or standing
; up in street cars. She was an equal!
| Rome rose and Rome fell; history
• repeats itself. And now the Sta
i ford "500" stand at the cross-roads.
!Oe fork leads on to greater and

ion to the Empress Eugenie hat
I stores. It is an aesthetic impossi
| bility to walk along both paths

No one seriously denies that these
Empress Eugenie hats are the most
comical and amusing creations that
the female world has yet bowed
down to in recent times. The fact
that 4 out of 5 women look absurd
in these bonnets is not very impor
tant; that question only concerns
the four. The problem that interests
the masses, however, is why the
four out of five look like they do,
and even still more important why
the fifth can command that saucy,
savoire-faire appearance by drop
ping a Robin Hood cap on the side
of her pretty little head.
The answer is close at hand. The
reason why these hats cause loud
guffaws from the natural and half
muffled giggles from the more polite
is their irritating incongruity. The
Eugenie bonnet is essentially coy
and demure;'and just such sur
roundings are necessary to make the
