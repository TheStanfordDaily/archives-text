'shadows ON THE HOCK, by
Willa Cather. Published 19.'51 by
Alfred A. Knopf $2.50.
In "Shadows on the Rock" Willa
i Cather has reached a new height in
• j the portrayal of character through
I the medium of descriptive geogra
phy. Using the picturesque back
j ground ,of Cape Diamant and the
! French colony of Quebec, she has
I created a workable philosophy for
! the everyday business man out of
j scraps of old history and intimate
j moments in the lives of a courage
; ous folk, the Canadian pioneers.
Euclide Auclair, the philosopher
J apothecary of Quebec, and his moth
j erless daughter, Cecile—simple peo
i pie with noble minds, members of
j ihe layman class, are the main char
| actcrs. In fact they are the plot,
j which at best is but a tiny thread
j upon which the real purpose of the
| book is hung. There can be no mis
! taking the fact that the characters
' are secondary, are important only as
they bring out the culture, and life,
| and beliefs of the time.
It is a beautifully written book;
; optimistic in the extreme, which is
j good for this depression - talking

! public — and suggesting a glorious
t anticipation of the future.
—V. B. T.

L J. Golden: PRECEDENT; Farrar
and Rinehart. New York- 19I5!. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
After production of a thousand
shades of A Night in Limehouse,
i melodrama fell into a disrepute not
j altogether merited. Today the word
I conjures up unpleasant visions of
| men smashing each other over the
head with papier mache chairs and
j firing viciously unloaded revolvers
!at one another, also of feminine
j shouts for virtue or death, of leers,
lurings, etcetera.
A mixture of melodrama and moral
! often proves detrimental to each.
! Precedent is good melodrama for an
i act or two but the complete white
wash covering Thomas (Mooney)
Dclaney contrasted with the totally
I shameless muckrake-in-hand law
makers, is less impassive than ludi
j crous.
It would be wiser to look elsewhere
i for both "ten-twent-thirst" thrillers
