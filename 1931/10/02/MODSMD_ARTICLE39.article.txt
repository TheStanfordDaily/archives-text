# The 						Windjammer
## 
### 
A lot of people have been caught
wondering out loud about the
strange disappearance of our old
friend Cabbages, and the installa
tion of this young upstart, on the
editorial page.
We're the same old vegetable
tosser masquerading under a
new heading, to keep up with
fashion. Just as "Eugenie" is
longer than plain "felt hat."
Windjammer is more impressive
and maybe has more of the
spirit of Napoleon. We shall see.
Anyhow, the Powers above mere
columnists were worried because
Cabbages took too many dirty cracks
at the DG's and tho Betas. (What
would you expect?) And the mere
mention of Cabbages meant whole
bushels of thorns in Chappie's side,
and sent the Old Boy into parox
ysms of rage.
We,'being broad-minded, rec
ognized the necessity for good
will, on the surface, at least, so
here we are, representing a
gentle wind among the Chappies,
or something.
Yes, and we have a swell new
motto, too, inscribed in plated gold
inlay filigree double-malted mush
just inside ihe main entrance to the
campus' underground piping system.
(See Webster, under "dirty work.")
It's a beautiful thing, that no
one understands: "You have
buttered your bread, and now
you must lie in it." Take it or
leave it. It's at least as good as
you could do.

Life is once more developing into
a merry-go-round, with classes be
ginning again this morning. Results
of long summer hours of fox-trot
ting, rumba-ing, tangoing, and danc
ing like a true Stanford gentleman
in various ports of the world, will
undoubtedly be plainly discernible
in the first weary moon shuffle up
the Rcw.
Even the people responsible
for building the god-awful Palm
Drive gales are reported to have
developed a novel terpischorean
number, enfitled "Two-Timing
the Sons of the Stanford Red."
$1)2,000 a throw for lessons in the
. art.

Meanwhile, with the first campus !
week-end coming up, and nothing j
very serious to do, we warn you to
be moderate models in all things,
keeping in mind, though, this ro
mantic ditty, evolved in the midst i
of a very warm afternoon spent ;
dashing around in the Administra- ,
tion Building: j
That gasoline and alcohol simply
won't mix
They told us, 'cause to drink we
hadn't ought-er;
If we're going to obey them,
we're in a hellish fix.
Just try mixing gasoline with
water!
