# HOPKINS MARINE STATION TO AID COAST NAVIGATION
## Strange Growths Attracted By Warm Weather Cover Hulls of Ships 
### 
Scientists of the Hopkins Marine
Laboratory of Stanford University
at Pacific Grove have responded to
a call from shippers operating in
southern waters and are using their
research facilities to solve serious
problems that have resulted from
the recent higher temperature of
the Pacific Ocean.
Weather changes during the sum
mer have resulted in an influx of
strange marine growths which occur
only in warm waters. Their appear
ance in the waters of southern Cali
fornia have seriously handicapped
shippers and attracted the attention
of marine authorities all over the
world.
Specimens of the "grass" which
has been the greatest source of
trouble to the shippers have been
classified by v the scientists at the
Stanford marine station as filograna,
a polychaet worm which propagates
both by egg and division. It lives in
small quill-like shells of living lime
bearing tissue.
Legions of these minute organisms
have invaded the waters off the
southern shore of this state, attracted
by the unusually high temperatures.
They attach themselves to rocks,
piles, the hulls of ships, and all
under-water structures and by their
rapid multiplication quickly form
heavy layers.

The speed and efficiency of small
pleasure craft and even of sea
going vessels have been so greatly
impaired by the quick growth of
this "grass" that frequent scrapings
in drydock are necessary. On one
oil tanker a layer of filograna six
and one-half inches thick gathered
in a period of 59 days.

The Wrigley tugs of the fleet
operating in the Los Angeles harbor
at Wilmington and the waters of
that region, are sent to the drydocks
for scraping at regular 90-day in
tervals in order to maintain their
efficiency of operation.
The scientists at Pacific Grove are
receiving the co-operation of the
California State Fishing Labora
tories on Terminal Island, the
Scripps Biological Institute at La
Jolla, the navy department's bureau
of construction and repair, and the
American Society of Marine Engi
neers.
Professor Aaron Treadwell of Vas
sal- College, Poughkeepsie, New
York, who has played an important
pari in the research work, has asked
E. A. Vaughn of the marine en
gineer society to prepare a paper on
the filograna. Vaughn has been
widely recognized as an authority
on the subject, according to Profes
sor Treadwell.
The Scripps Institute has reported
the appearance of an unclassified sea
bug which has invaded the kelp beds
in great numbers, and is rapidly
destroying them. It eats the kelp
from the top.
Fish never before seen in Catalina
Channel have entered those waters
in large numbers this summer.

trouble to the shippers have been
classified by v the scientists at the
Stanford marine station as filograna,
a polychaet worm which propagates
both by egg and division. It lives in
small quill-like shells of living lime
bearing tissue.
Legions of these minute organisms
have invaded the waters off the
southern shore of this state, attracted
by the unusually high temperatures.
They attach themselves to rocks,
piles, the hulls of ships, and all
under-water structures and by their
rapid multiplication quickly form
heavy layers.

The speed and efficiency of small
pleasure craft and even of sea
going vessels have been so greatly
impaired by the quick growth of
this "grass" that frequent scrapings
in drydock are necessary. On one
oil tanker a layer of filograna six
and one-half inches thick gathered
in a period of 59 days.

The Wrigley tugs of the fleet
operating in the Los Angeles harbor
at Wilmington and the waters of
that region, are sent to the drydocks
for scraping at regular 90-day in
tervals in order to maintain their
efficiency of operation.
The scientists at Pacific Grove are
receiving the co-operation of the
California State Fishing Labora
tories on Terminal Island, the
Scripps Biological Institute at La
Jolla, the navy department's bureau
of construction and repair, and the
American Society of Marine Engi
neers.
Professor Aaron Treadwell of Vas
sal- College, Poughkeepsie, New
York, who has played an important
pari in the research work, has asked
E. A. Vaughn of the marine en
gineer society to prepare a paper on
the filograna. Vaughn has been
widely recognized as an authority
on the subject, according to Profes
sor Treadwell.
The Scripps Institute has reported
the appearance of an unclassified sea
bug which has invaded the kelp beds
in great numbers, and is rapidly
destroying them. It eats the kelp
from the top.
Fish never before seen in Catalina
Channel have entered those waters
in large numbers this summer.
Scientists of the Hopkins Marine
Laboratory of Stanford University
at Pacific Grove have responded to
a call from shippers operating in
southern waters and are using their
research facilities to solve serious
problems that have resulted from
the recent higher temperature of
the Pacific Ocean.
Weather changes during the sum
mer have resulted in an influx of
strange marine growths which occur
only in warm waters. Their appear
ance in the waters of southern Cali
fornia have seriously handicapped
shippers and attracted the attention
of marine authorities all over the
world.
