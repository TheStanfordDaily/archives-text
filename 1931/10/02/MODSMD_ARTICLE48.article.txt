# RANKS OF JUSTICES WILL BE REALIGNED IN SUPREME COURT
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (/P).â€”Two
of the black-robed Justices who will
step into the Supreme Court cham
ber next Monday are reminders of
the shadow of change in personnel
rrid viewpoint which hovers over
its members.

One is Charles Evans Hughes, who
succeeded William Howard Taft-
The other is Owen J. Roberts, who
I 1
took the place of Edward Terry San
j ford of Tennessee.
Taft and Sanford died early in
3930. In less than a year there
was talk of a new alignment of the
: Court which found Justices Butler,
Sutherland, Van Deventer, and Mc-
I Reynolds a dissenting minority on
! several broad questions. When Taft
and Sanford were alive, it was gen
erally Stone, Holmes, and Brandeis
who disagreed with the majority.
Two of the three so often found
j together on controversial issues in
the past are eligible for retirement.
One of these, Oliver Wendell
Holmes, is approaching 91. He is the
oldest man ever to sit on the su
preme bench.
