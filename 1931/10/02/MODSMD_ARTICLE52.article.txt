## THE 						BEAR GROWLS 
### 
With another week's intensive
practice under their belts, a smooth
er working California team is ex
pected to face St. Mary's tomorrow
than that which barely nosed out
Santa Clara last Saturday, 6-2.
The question is, however, will the
Bears be improved enough to stop
the Galloping Gaels? John Bunn,
who scouted the St. Mury's-U.S.C.
upset of last week, doesn't think so.
"St. Mary's appeared in mid
season form, presenting a fairly
smooth offense and a rugged de
fense that I believe will be far
too much for California," Bunn
said yesterday. "California will ,
be lucky to make even a fair
showing Saturday, let alone stop
Madigan's team."
"Clumsy" is the word most fre
quently applied to the Bears by im
partial observers who have seen
them in action, but no reflection is
meant to be cast on Coach "Navy
Bill" Ingram. It is simply a matter
of the task of learning a new system
of play being too great to produce
smoothness so early in the season.
And for another thing, as Bunn
pointed out, Ingram must of neces
sity still be unfamiliar with his
squad, and is naturally having to
feel his way along.
"I have no duobt that Califor
nia will present a much strong
er team toward the end of the
season," Bunn said, 'but it is too
much to expect of them to stop
so powerful a team as St Mary's
this early." ,
Meanwhile, in spite of the injury
to Schaldach, a persistent opinion is
voiced in some quarters that the
Bears will be a big surprise tomor
row. For the most part, this is based
on hunch, the Bears having had the
Indian sign on the Gaels of late.
Well, well, i just missed
grabbing that foul ball," re
marked Graham McNamee,
apropos of nothing, during yes
terday's world series opener.
"I suppose when one does come
up here, it will hit me on the
head."
"Here's hoping," snorted a
disgusted senior, listening to
the game at the Union.
WATCH OREGON STATE
Southern California will meet a
not -to- be - taken - lightly Oregon
State eleven at Los Angeles tomor
row, and it will be interesting to see
what effect the Gael triumph has
had on the Trojans.
The game will also serve as a
measure of Coach Schissler's crew,
which the Indians will meet in two
weeks. The northerners gave Stan
ford a bad time cf it last year, and
are reputed to be stronger this sea
yon.
With a heavy line and speedy
backfield, look for O.S.C. to do some
upsetting of their own before the
season is over.â€”L. M C.
