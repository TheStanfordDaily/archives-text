# Babes Tackle L.A. Jaysees in Prelim Tomorrow
## COACH GIVES MEN LOTS OF WORK AS HARD TILT LOOMS Bradshaw Lists Starters; Flannagan, Mottram Star In Practice 
### Stewart Crawford 
If hard work moulds lough grid
teams, Jimmy Bradshaw's Papoose
j eleven ought to be ready to eat
j nails by Saturday noon, when they
j lake to the Stadium field to do bat
! tie against an invading Los Angeles
Junior College team.
"Rabbit" had advance notice that
j these boys from the South were
tough customers, so right away he
made out a prescription for his year
| lings that calls for a large dose of
| WORK, straight and strong.
Every time we have visited Ihe
! freshman practice lot during the
j current week a scrimmage of some
j sort has been in progress. Last night
| the men chosen to 'start Saturday
j were going at it hammer and tongs
| against a fighting band of reserves.
The boys on the offensive, starters
| tomorrow, were as follows Durkee
j and Kahn, ends; Lettunich and Kel-
I ler, tackles; Semmelroth and Mott
j ram, guards; Van Kirk, center;
| Flannagan, quarter; Boles and
I Moore, halfbacks; and Seaver, full.
And in spite of the strength of
t this outfit, it was not able to wreak
I an appreciable amount of damage
upon the reserves. It was a Notre
Dame style of play they were work
ing against, the system employed by
the Jaysees frpm the South.
However, the center of the fxrst
i string line looked strong • .nough,
| with Lettunich probably the out
standing tackle, and Mottram the
star guard. The wingmen, too,
| seemed to be carrying cut their as
j signments in effective style.
, But it was the babe backfield that
sparkled. Flannagan and Seaver,
quarter and full, respectively,
showed plunging ability reminiscent
of the old Chuck Smalling-Herb
S Flcischhacker combination. Watch
| this boy Flannagan Saturday.
Moore, who was shifted to half
| from the fullback berth when big
Charlie Seaver tossed aside his golf
I sticks to climb into a grid suit,
showed last night that he can run
off-tackle and around end. Moffatt
j style, with speed that his compact

weight belies.
And if you don't think he can take
his turn at bowling over opposing
linemen, you should have seen him
go against Marin.
Boles, a newcomer on the first
string, must have been hiding some
where up till this week, perhaps
behind the broad, stocky figure of
Walt Heinecke, Stanford's ail-Amer
ican center of 1929, who is now line
coach of the youngsters.
At any rate, Boles wasn't dis
covered for some time, and it is no
wonder, for he is so small that any
coach would look at him once and
tell him he would be murdered in
college competition. This little
charge of dynamite can't weigh more
than 145 pounds at the most. Yet he
usually gets there when he sets out
to go places.
Running in an open field, the lit
tle fellow shifts his hips and changes
pace like a veteran, and don't think
he isn't tough. He hits with surpris
ing drive, and seldom falls back
ward when he is tackled. And when
the 'joys do get him down, they
have to hang on tight or he'll be
up again and away in a jilly.

Moore, who was shifted to half

Charlie Seaver tossed aside his golf
I sticks to climb into a grid suit,
showed last night that he can run
off-tackle and around end. Moffatt
j style, with speed that his compact

weight belies.
And if you don't think he can take
his turn at bowling over opposing
linemen, you should have seen him
go against Marin.
Boles, a newcomer on the first
string, must have been hiding some
where up till this week, perhaps
behind the broad, stocky figure of
Walt Heinecke, Stanford's ail-Amer
ican center of 1929, who is now line
coach of the youngsters.
At any rate, Boles wasn't dis
covered for some time, and it is no
wonder, for he is so small that any
coach would look at him once and
tell him he would be murdered in
college competition. This little
charge of dynamite can't weigh more
than 145 pounds at the most. Yet he
usually gets there when he sets out
to go places.
Running in an open field, the lit
tle fellow shifts his hips and changes
pace like a veteran, and don't think
he isn't tough. He hits with surpris
ing drive, and seldom falls back
ward when he is tackled. And when
the 'joys do get him down, they
have to hang on tight or he'll be
up again and away in a jilly.
If hard work moulds lough grid
teams, Jimmy Bradshaw's Papoose

Junior College team.
"Rabbit" had advance notice that
j these boys from the South were
tough customers, so right away he
made out a prescription for his year

Every time we have visited Ihe
! freshman practice lot during the
j current week a scrimmage of some
j sort has been in progress. Last night
| the men chosen to 'start Saturday
j were going at it hammer and tongs
| against a fighting band of reserves.
The boys on the offensive, starters
| tomorrow, were as follows Durkee
j and Kahn, ends; Lettunich and Kel-
I ler, tackles; Semmelroth and Mott
j ram, guards; Van Kirk, center;
| Flannagan, quarter; Boles and
I Moore, halfbacks; and Seaver, full.
And in spite of the strength of
t this outfit, it was not able to wreak
I an appreciable amount of damage
upon the reserves. It was a Notre
Dame style of play they were work
ing against, the system employed by
the Jaysees frpm the South.
However, the center of the fxrst
i string line looked strong • .nough,
| with Lettunich probably the out
standing tackle, and Mottram the
star guard. The wingmen, too,

j signments in effective style.

sparkled. Flannagan and Seaver,
