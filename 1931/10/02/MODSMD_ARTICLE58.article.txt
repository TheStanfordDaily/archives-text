# "GREAT COURSE," SAYS NEW GOLF PRO; "NO PREDICTION POSSIBLE AT PRESENT"

### FRANK LLOYD 
Shooting a 75 on his first round j
;on the Stanford golf course, and
| thereby nosing out none other than j
' our "boy coach," Dink Templeton, j
! who got a 7fi, Eddie Twiggs, the i
j Farm's new pro, gave ample evi- J
| deuce that he is capable of handling |
j his new job.
"A great course with plenty of |
j interest for any golfer," was Eddie i
! Twiggs' comment on the campus J
j golf pastures. The new Card coach '
I has been playing for 16 years at I
| Lakeside with the Olympic Club. j
j Yesterday marked the first ap- j
i pea ranee of Eddie Twiggs into the
| ranks of the professionals, as he had
] previously played only as an ama
j teur. Up to three years ago Twiggs
I had played in most of the impor
| tant tournaments about Ihe country 1
! and was considered as one of Anier- I
j ica's best players. i

J Although the Stanford coach nev-
I or gained the coveted national ama
teur title, he was considered as a
j dangerous contender and as some-
I one who had to be reckoned with
I in any match.
| Having been on the Farm only for
| a couple of days and not knowing
| just who would sign up for golf this
! year, Twiggs felt he was not in a
J position as yet to make a prediction
' of the team* and its strength. How-
I ever, with the prospect of Seaver
j and Little and several of last year's
! veterans on the squad, any predic
tion is bound to be fairly optimistic.
Anyone, no matter how little tal
ent he may* possess, is urged by the
j Stanford golf mentor to go out for
! golf. Several courses are offered this
5 quarter in elementary and advanced
i golf with such men as Harry Wol
i ter and Bill Ellington in charge.
