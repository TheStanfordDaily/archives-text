# BUGGE OPTIMISTIC OVER BABE TENNIS; VARSITY UNCERTAIN
## 
### 
Tennis prospects for the coming
j season are shaping up as athletic
' registration nears completion, and a
: fairly optimistic forecast is in order.
â€¢ Freshman possibilities are good, in
the opinion of Elwyn Bugge, direc
j tor of tennis, but no pre-season dope
would be safe until the incoming
youngsters prove their merit.
As for varsity possibilities, it may
only be said that a fair showing is
assured. No such demonstration as
that of last year's super-team could
hardly be possible, as some of the
I mainstays of the upper ranks are
missing this season.
Keith Gledhill, the famous Car
dinal star who added so much to
his name last summer, will be on
hand to captain the outfit, with Joe
j Coughlin, last year's fourth man, in
| second position. The rankings be
j yond this point, however, are un
j certain. With the loss of Ted Easton,
j last year's captain, and Harry Ply
j mire, third man, two berths of high
importance are left vacant. Phil
Niederauer, Wilbur Cox, Trow Ste
phens, and Chuck Weesner, all top
| notch racket experts, will also be
j sorely missed.
To balance this deficit partially,
! however, come Robert Rhodes and
J Jack Cosgrove from Menlo J.C., and
Chuck Otisr captain of last year's
successful Stanford babes, as well
as Dan Ellis, Monte Shwayder, and
others who supported Otis last sea
i son.
