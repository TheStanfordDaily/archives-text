## Derringer Hurls Brilliant Ball at Start; Wilts When A's Rally 
### 
SPORTSMAN'S PARK,
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 1 (/P).â€”'The Phila
delphia Athletics uniimbered their
heavy artillery on the enemy's home
battleground today, fired two boom
ing salvos that crushed the youthful
Cardinals' sharpshooter, Paul Der
ringer, and moved triumphantly to
ward their goal of a third world
baseball championship.
The final score was 6 to 2 as the
Athletics, in a characteristically
skillful exhibition, subdued St.
Louis in the opening skirmish of the
big series behind the somewhat er
ratic pitching of the great Robert
Moses Grove.
Cards Score in First
A howling, hopeful crowd of 38,-
529 hometown customers came out
to cheer the Cardinals in their fresh
attempt to stop Connie Mack's base
ball steamroller. They saw the great
Grove touched for two runs in the
very first inning, only to steady
down and pitch himself out of a
flock of critical situations in holding
the National League champions
scoreless for the rest of the game.
The Red Birds outhit the world
champions, 12 to 11, but the big guns
of the A's were more destructive,
and accomplished the downfall of
the youthful Derringer in decisive
fashion. Four runs in a wild third
inning, when Derringer lost control,
forced in the tying run and then
was blasted for a single by Jimmy
Foxx with the bases full, decided
the game.
Simmons Hits Homer
As a parting salute, A1 Simmons
drove a home run into the left field
bleachers in the seventh inning with
Mickey Cochrane on base. After that
wallop the fading Cardinal hopes
flickered out, Derringer yielding to
a pinch hitter. Sylvester Johnson
held the A's hitless in the last two
innings.
The opening game drew a crowd
that was barely 1,000 short of the
park's capacity. The receipts, $165,-
161, were about $4,000 short of the
record for St. Louis.
The Athletics blasted the hopes
the National Leaguers had placed on
the youthful Derringer, a "fresh
man" big leaguer making his first
world series start.
Derringer Starts Well
For two innings, as he struck out
four of the six batsmen to face him,
the 25 - year - old Kentucky boy
looked like the sensation he was ex
pected to be. He fanned Bishop and
Haas to start the game and struck
out Foxx and Miller in the second
inning to the accompaniment of wild
applause.
It was a brilliant start, too good to
be true, in fact, as events in the
third inning quickly demonstrated.
Cards Hammer Grove
Grove was hit harder than Der
ringer all the way. He fanned seven
Cardinals, whereas Derringer's de
ceptive curves set down nine of the
A's on strikes.
The advantage now is all with the
A's, who will play their second ace
pitcher, George Earnshaw, tomor
row against the Cardinal southpaw,
Bill Hallahan, and then move to
Philadelphia for three games next
week.
