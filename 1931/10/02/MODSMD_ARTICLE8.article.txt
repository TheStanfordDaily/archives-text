# FEWER REGISTER THAN LAST YEAR
## Total Enrollment After Second Day Is 3,463 
### 
Enrollment figures at the close of j
the second day of registration show
3,463 students, fifty less than on the I
second day a year ago, when the j
total was 3,513. Of the total this :
year, 109 had not completely met all
registration requirements when the !
office closed; last year the number ,
who still had some details to finish !
was 83.
There is a possibility that by the
time registration is finished the total
will be close to that of last year, j
since a larger number of old stu- 1
dents may be deferring their return j
to the University than did a year 1
ago, when registration day and the :
first day of classes was one day j
earlier in the week than it is this j
year. This year there will be only
one day of classes between registra- j
tion and the week-end, which may j
cause some to wait until Monday
before registering. This possibility !
is somewhat supported by the fact j
that the registration of new students <
this year, 944, is a little larger than i
it was at the end of the second day j
a year ago, when it was 938.
