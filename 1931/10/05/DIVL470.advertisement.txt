* Translation: Hello yon Stan
ford men. Glad ijon're bach.
Wear (jot something for yon . . .
CLOTHES. . .extra-fine clothes at common-sense prices.
That's what we want to show you.
Frankly, here is the greatest lineup of university men's
apparel we've ever had. Steady, year-by-year improve
ment brings us this fall to our goal. The objective we
pointed toward 3 years ago when we first served Stan
ford men.
To you this means:
Suits of smarter tailoring than you can buy anywhere
else at similar prices because
They're made from start to finish by our own tailors.
And we're the only university men's store in the
West that has a shop of this kind—that does all its
own tailoring.
That's why, too, you get superior materials inside
and out —fabrics, buttons, linings, etc., yet pay only
$35 to $60 for a real "tailor-made" that's a perfect
fot. . .that looks trim and new when ordinary suits
are ready for the rag-man. Deftly built to your own
individual pattern, not on the same "dummy 1 ' for
anyone and everyone.
You'll be proud of the suit we make for
£p M-l you. And Phelps-Terkel's good name
guarantees your absolute satisfaction.
