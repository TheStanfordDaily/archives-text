# REST HOMES DO LARGE SERVICE
## Record Number Of Cases Handled Last Year 
### 
Double the number of cases of
any previous year were taken care
of last year by Stanford Men's and
Women's Rest Homes, according to
the second annual report issued re
cently by the Stanford Mothers'
Club, sponsors of the rest homes.
Last year the homes took care of
278 cases. Students recovering from
operations, sinus infections, bad
colds, nervous breakdown, and gen
erally run-down physical condition
were able to return to rest and
quiet after their classes. Hospital
cases are not taken, but only those
which require good food, sleep, rest,
and pleasant surroundings.
To keep it within the means of
students,-only $3 a day is charged.
In many cases the Students' Hospi
tal Fund is available for the first
week of an illness, so the patient
need pay only $1 a day. Since 500
students are supporting themselves
entirely, and 2000 partially, it is
many times impossible for them to
pay even that amount, in which case
the Stanford Mothers' Club ofTers
assistance. All cases are reported
daily to the medical department of
the university as to the progress
and general status of the patients.
Mrs- Owens had 121 women in
her care at the Women's Rest Home
and Mrs. Carr, head of the Men's
Rest Home, took care of 145 men
during the past year. These stu
dents spent, in all, 1421 days in the
two institutions.
