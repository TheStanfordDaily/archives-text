# BRONCOS HOLD CARD OFFENSE TO 6-0 SCORE
## Santa Clara Goal Besieged Several Times During Second Half HILLMAN LONE SCORER Final Goal-Line Dash Shows Unexpected Power 
### 
Maybe they'll do and maybe thoy
won't.

That's about all that can be said
for a Stanford varsity that mopped
vip all but the most important five
yards of the field with Santa Clara
last Saturday and came out thank
ful for a one-touchdown triumph.
For 25 minutes of the second half,
the peppermint-jerseyed Indians
marched up to, but never past, the
Santa Clara goal line in a manner
that was reminiscent of (he Big Red
Machines of five years ago. Four
times in a row the youths from far
ther down the valley dug cleats into
the turf and the Stanford attack
smashed itself to bits against the
blue-shirted wall.
Shows Power
Plays were working during those
advances. Dusty Allen was rifling
beautiful passes for goodly gains on
three out of every five attempts, tho
halfbacks were splitting the Bronco
tackles with regularity, and best of
all, Captain Harry Hillman was
busting the center of the line as he
did in the forepart of the 1929 sea
son—packing tacklers with him as
he hit.
But each time something went
wrong, and Stanford would come up
to the third-down play in the hole,
with nothing left but a pass. Once
George Grey's place-kick angled
widely to the left and three times
Dusty Allen's passes found no re
ceiver near. On each occasion Joe
Paglia kicked out to near midfield
and the Indians started back again.
47-Yard March
The drive was a thing of
beautiful precision and left the fans
wondering why it hadn't worked
that way before. From Stanford's
47, where Moffatt had been downed
with Paglia's kick, Allen tossed
shaiply to Phil Neill, who lateraled
to Moffatt. A Bronc halfback dragged
Nifty Phil down on the 43-yard line.
Tommy Lambert slid off right tackle
for seven and Captain Hillman split
the Santa Clara center apart for the
first down on the Bronco 32. Moffatt
j whirled over the opposite tackle for
i eight in a short put prettily twisting
j run and Lambert went to the 19 for
another first down.
From there to the goal line it took
just two plays. Moffatt and Neill
moved the Santa Clara right tackle
j almost to the sidelines and Lambert
went sliding and twisting 14 yards
; to a spot five yards from the last
! white line. Hillman, gathering him
self for a plunge, found an opening
j at right guard, instead of a pileup.
j Powers, backing up the line, hit him
on the twc-yard line, but Harry
| was travelling and he was over be
fore Powers could hold him. Grey'o
I place-kick on the try-for-point was
low, and it was all over.
Gopher Game Toss-up
The contest left the Minnesota
I game a mystery whose uncertainty
, has been heightened by the Gophers'
; showing. A 13-7 win over North
j Dakota State and a 20-0 win from
' Oklahoma A. and M. mean nothing
I to coast fans, as far as comparison
; with the Indians goes.
Coach Warner, coming out of the
| contest with minor injuries to Grey,
| Allen, and Don Colvin, has an
nounced that he will choose his defi
| nite first-string lineup this week
i and that he will move Ernie Caddel
i back to light half and give Piudy
