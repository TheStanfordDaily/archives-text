# ANOTHER TRADITION GONE, THANK HEAVEN!

Another Stanford'-tradition, the sophomore raid on
Encina I kill the night preceding the frosh-soph tie-up, has
|>v the hoards, Banned by ollicial decree, the raid lias
outlived its place in campus life and has become a stigma
(in the name of the University. Its going is a decided
t hauge for the better.
The raid had its beginnings in the more or less harm
less custom of a few sophomores entering the hall, grab
bing off one of their particular friends, and taking him out
to perform for their amusement. In the past few years this
custom has grown to immense proportions, the sopho
mores attempting to rush the hall in a body and, when
their way was barred by the freshmen en masse, a battle
followed which resulted in a heavy property damage and
not a few physical impairments to the combatants.
This* raid has outgrown its simple beginning and has
become a destructive practice that no longer deserves the
name of a "Stanford tradition." In view of this fact strin
gent measures have been taken to see that it does not take
place. Hut it should not take stringent measures nor police
enforcement to prevent a group of supposedly civilized,
< ducated men from beating each other black and blue and
wantonly destroying property for no purpose whatsoever.
This raid has gone under the misnomer of a tradition
which the sophomores feel obliged to perpetuate. Now that
ii is clearly seen that this raid is no longer such a tradition,
working as it does against the interests of the University
and its students, its demise should be no more speedy than
it deserves.
