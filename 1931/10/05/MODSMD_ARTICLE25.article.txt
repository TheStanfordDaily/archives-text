						LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING
## 
### 
To I he Stanford campus comes Jonathan A. Butler, erst
while Big Ten mogul, to assume a roving commission as
investigator of athletic conditions in the Pacific Coast Con
ference. Denying vigorously that he is to he a "czar' of
any sort, Butler has announced that he will merely turn
in his findings to the Conference.
With such a blanket assignment, Butler may run into
a great many funny things concerning eligibility and the
hiring of athletes. Ovcrzealous alumni have always been
a problem. Butler, if his investigation is fruitful, may bring
to public view some things of whose existence the Con
ference may be already aware, even though it may not
have had enough information to act on them. The now
famous Carnegie Foundation Bulletin only confirmed
common knowledge that subsidization of athletes, in one
form or another, has been going on in the Conference, in
some schools more than in others.
.lust what will happen if Butler turns up with something
on every one of the ten institutions? Will there be a gen
era! whitewashing, or a general condemnation, or a com
promise? The entire coast awaits with interest the com
missioner's report.
