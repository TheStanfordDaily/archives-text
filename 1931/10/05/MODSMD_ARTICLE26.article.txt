# WHERE CREDIT IS DUE
## 
### 
In caring for 27S cases during the past academic year,
the Stanford Mothers' Club, through the two rest homes,
has performed a real service, a service that deserves to be
perpetuated.
The rest homes for both men and women students were
designed to provide home care in cases of illness not seri
< us enough to warrant hospital treatment, but like so many
similar undertakings is handicapped by a lack of funds to
carry on the work.
To the Stanford Mothers' Club goes the credit for carry
ing on in the face of financial obstacles and to Mrs. Owens
and Mrs. Carr credit for the sympathy and understanding
which are of inestimable value to recuperation and conva
lescence.
