# BULL SESSION
## KISSING BABIES AND MILKING COWS 
### 
A person running for political of
fice must frame campaign issues or
at least promises, makes speeches,
meet voters; but just as important,
if not important than any of
these activities, is the need for ap
pealing to the people's heart. The
politician's desire to appear before
the citizenry as the living embodi
ment of all that is sweet and good
and beautiful and true takes on
many amusing forms.
These men who run for office are
often cold fish —with as much bal
lot-box appeal as Clara Bow with
her legs hidden by a horse blanket.
These candidates would be more
than willing to talk quibblingly on
a few stale issues and let it go at
that. But no, the public wants a
show and a good one at that. The
populace would like to believe that
every office-seeker had the dash of
T. Roosevelt, Sr., the heart-appeal
of Lincoln, the bravado of Jackson,
and all the other legendary Ameri
can ideals to boot.
What is the result? In business,
the customer is right; and in poli
tics, the voter must be satisfied. So
candidates are forced to do things
that would seem to indicate that
they are what people want them
to he. Calvin Coolidge probably suf
fered more than anybody. He is a
decidedly unemotional man, to say
the least. Yet he was forced to don
cowboy togs. Probably the saddest
sight in modern politics was the thin
New England visage shaded by a
five-gallon Stetson; and to add to
Cal's obvious torture, he was forced
to wear those shaggy trousers
called chaps. No wonder the poor
man doesn't want to run again in
1932.
Milking cows or husking corn is
a very trite but effective way to

i show the candidate's great love for
the farmer. Some observers feel
| that one good milking is better than
j three promises for aid although
; others feel that two promises over
| a national hookup will balance a
! milking; still others, however, feel
that, like in baseball, it is desirable
to mix them up.
Everybody likes children and
| therefore candidates must love all
j children. Why mothers would like a
man who could get a nomination to
1 plant kisses on their little darlings
is beyond me; but they do crave
| the honor, and for a presidential
) candidate to refuse the privilege
i would be sheer political suicide.
In California, we have about the
j best, most natural baby-kisser and
j cow-milker in the West if not in
j the whole United States. In fact, he
I even kisses Fiesta queens and seems
i to enjoy it. Sunny Jim Rolph may
! perform all the ballyhoo in the
! racket, but let it be said to his
j everlasting credit, that he performs
! with a grace and a charm that
| should prove a lesson and an ideal
j to all that seek to tread in his path.
This so-called "humanizing" of
! politicians goes merrily on its way
as a positive necessity where every-
I body is expected to participate in
| the dry processes of government.
I Hoover invites a school-bus hero to
! the White House and entertains him
i in front of the cameras with weighty
! problems taxing his time. Franklin
I D. Roosevelt of New York gives a
j pint of his blood to help the fight
| against infantile paralysis; and
! Democratic stock goes up ten points.
The super-candidate of the future
i will be able to kiss babies, milk
cows, pin medals, and talk to factory
j workers all at the same time. His
election will be conceded without
' argument. —Abe Mellinkoff.

A person running for political of
fice must frame campaign issues or
at least promises, makes speeches,
meet voters; but just as important,
if not important than any of
these activities, is the need for ap
pealing to the people's heart. The
politician's desire to appear before
the citizenry as the living embodi
ment of all that is sweet and good
and beautiful and true takes on
many amusing forms.
These men who run for office are
often cold fish —with as much bal
lot-box appeal as Clara Bow with
her legs hidden by a horse blanket.
These candidates would be more
than willing to talk quibblingly on
a few stale issues and let it go at
that. But no, the public wants a
show and a good one at that. The
populace would like to believe that
every office-seeker had the dash of
T. Roosevelt, Sr., the heart-appeal
of Lincoln, the bravado of Jackson,
and all the other legendary Ameri
can ideals to boot.
What is the result? In business,
the customer is right; and in poli
tics, the voter must be satisfied. So
candidates are forced to do things
that would seem to indicate that
they are what people want them
to he. Calvin Coolidge probably suf
fered more than anybody. He is a
decidedly unemotional man, to say
the least. Yet he was forced to don
cowboy togs. Probably the saddest
sight in modern politics was the thin
New England visage shaded by a
five-gallon Stetson; and to add to
Cal's obvious torture, he was forced
to wear those shaggy trousers
called chaps. No wonder the poor
man doesn't want to run again in
1932.
Milking cows or husking corn is
a very trite but effective way to

i show the candidate's great love for
the farmer. Some observers feel
| that one good milking is better than
j three promises for aid although
; others feel that two promises over
| a national hookup will balance a
! milking; still others, however, feel
that, like in baseball, it is desirable
to mix them up.
Everybody likes children and
| therefore candidates must love all
j children. Why mothers would like a
man who could get a nomination to
1 plant kisses on their little darlings
is beyond me; but they do crave
| the honor, and for a presidential
) candidate to refuse the privilege
i would be sheer political suicide.
