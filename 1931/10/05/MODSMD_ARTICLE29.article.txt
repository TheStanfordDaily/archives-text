THE FRONT PAGE—At the Mcnlo i fated men.

Theatre.
Fast-moving, rapid-fire action and
dialogue, handled in city-room style,
and conforming, in all but the pro
fanity, with the stage version. The
profanity is there, all right, but the
censors have shielded,, the public
morals by having loud noises, such
as typewriters and doors banging,
drown out the naughty syllables.
Adolphe Menjou abandons his
sleek drawing-room roles for that
of a rough, tough managing editor,
and practically makes the picture.
Mae Clarke is great as the street
walker, and Pat O'Brien does well
with the part of Hildy Johnson.
First-class entertainment all the
way. —M. L. J.
HTE LAST FLIGHT—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
if The Last Flight" is positively
macabre in its mixture of comedy
and tragedy. The story of four avi
ators, nerve-wrecked by the wav
and trying to find some sort of re
lief drinking their way through Eu
rope, is drawn with a light touch
and never a let-up or slow moment.
Helen Chandler as the tragi
comcdienne who sees her bar-rqom
companions killed off one by one
carries off all the honors. Her Bus
ter Keaton-like seriousness of mien,
combined with her highly ludicrous
remarks, lays a blanket of laughter
over the restless tragedy of the four

The lines are full of snap and,
| rare thing in talkies, sometimes show
I a certain amount of subtlety.
All the characters are so well cast
j that they even manage to make
| serious and determined drinking
j and the consequent drunkenness
! convincing.
Unless you want to know how to
j be beautiful in the Hollywood man
ner skip the preliminaries and wait
for the feature, but don't miss that.
