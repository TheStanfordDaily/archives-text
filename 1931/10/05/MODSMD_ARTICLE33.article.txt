This business of trying to settle
down in a business-like way to
make people chuckle while the
eight-o'clock prof drones on! How
can we tell what makes people laugh,
anyhow? We've seriously considered
making an index of cards contrib
uted by interested spectators around
ihe campusâ€”requesting Ted Cook
on Mondays, Mclntyre and Winchell
or Brisbane in oft' moments, and just
plain campus guff the rest of the
time. What the hell, Archie?
Shooing away ambitious boys try
ing to sell us Good Housekeeping
with four pairs of real silk hose, all
summer, has given us an idea on
how to ultimately crash the Pearly
Gates. Merely assume the appro
priate disguise and repeat one of
the following:
"How do, Saint Peter. I'm just
a college hoy working my way
up from hell. Could I have a
few moments inside to sell the
World Review? All the news
from down below. Only $1 "
"Good day, sir. God sent me
around to (a) tune harps, (b) grease
the angel's wings, (c) repair haloes."
"Hello, Pete. Brown's my
name, from the Earthly Argus.
The old man wants an inter
view. How d'ya like your job?
D'ya get many tips? And say,
what does Cleopatra think of
Aimec? Ha! Well, maybe that
Egyptian sand was different. By
the way, could I take a look
around?"
"Collecting unemployment statis
tics for Mr. Hoover, Mr. Peter.
What! you're on a no-hour, no-week
basis? Well, I'll take a look around,
anyway, at the working conditions."
"I think I should be admitted.
Somebody stole one of my Big
Game tickets so I advertised and
gave him another one. Thanks."
