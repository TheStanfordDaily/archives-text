# GORGEOUS GAELS BOWL OVER BEARS TO 14-0 REFRAIN
## California Lack of Attack And St. Mary's Passes Decide the Issue 
### Lowell Cox 
Tho Bears saw red Saturday af
ternoon, but the bells of St. Mary's
rang out Saturday night.
For the first time since 1926 the
Galloping Gaels of Moraga defeated
the Golden Bears of Berkeley,
breaking the "Indian sign" which
California has had on Madigan
elevens for four years.
A perfectly functioning aerial
attack won for St. Mary's, while
a total lack of offense and a
woeful weakness on defense
against passes spelled 14 to 0
disaster for California.
The Bears saw red, scarlet in fact,
when Coach "Slip" Madigan sent his
crew onto the ragged turf of Me
morial Stadium. So vivid were the
Gael pantaloons, "Pop" Warner's
peppermint panties would look a
pale pink by comparison.
And the Bears saw red three min
utes later, when the Gaels recovered
a fumble on the California 21-yard
line and swept to a first down on
the seven-yard marker. Four plays
were flung at the stalwart Bear line,
and when the smoke cleared away,
the ball was still half a yard from
Ihc goal.
Gaels Come Back
The California rooters breathed a
s!gh of relief, but the Gaels were
soon knocking at the door again,
and this time they were not to be
denied. Taking the ball on the Cali
fornia 39-yard stripe, the Madigan
men struck twice through the air
to gain first down just two yards
from the goal. The Bears held Tos
cani, but on the second play Fletcher
plunged over. Fletcher also added
the extra point, and it was St. Mary's
7, California 0 with the game just
eight minutes old.
Again in the third period an aerial
attack netted the Gaels a touch
down. This time they started on
their own 24-yard line, after Fletch
er intercepted Valianos' pass.
Two long passes, Baird to Tos
cani, and an end run by Baird,
took them to the nine-yard line.
Here it looked as if the' Bears
might hold, as they had early in
the game, but after three plays
Baird shot a short pass to George
Canrinus for the goal. Again
Fletcher converted, and scoring
was over for the day.
California supporters may point
with pride to three things about the
gameâ€”the defensive strength of the
iine from tackle to tackle, the really
fine punting of Watkins and Vali
anos, and the fighting spirit of the
team.
No Offense Shown
As for Bear offense, there was
none. Running plays netted them
but 36 yards while losing 21, a net
total of 15 yards. One pass was com
pleted for a gain of 12 yards. And
that was all.
Perhaps Ingram has plans, but
there was not so much as a hint of
future offensive strength, unless it
was their passing attack, which
might function against a team with
less perfect aerial defense than St.
Mary's.
