# Frosh Down L.A.J.C. In Flashy 19-0 Tilt
## Moore Stars With Running Attacks; Passing Looks Good; Seaver On One End Of Two Touchdowns 
### BY FRANCIS HAMILTON 
FLAUNTING a clover attack coupled with the powerful running threats
1 of Moore and Bowles, the Stanford freshman gridders won from Los
] Angeles Junior College Saturday, 19 to 0. Two neat passing plays gained
the Cardinals' first score: Durkee to Kahn from the Los Angeles 28-yard
line that was good for 24 yards, and Seaver to Durkee with a lateral to
' Bowles for the touchdown. Later in the third quarter Moore fought his
| way through Jaysee tacklers to fall across the defenders' goal and make
i the score 13 to 0 for the Babes. The *

third Stanford touchdown also went 1
by airline, Rothert to Seaver. from '
1 the L.A. 16-yard mark.
Two Line Stars
The Angelenos could do little with .
i the ball to better their own cause. !
: Van Kirk and Mottram were out
! standing in the Cardinal line, and
i Flannagan's presence behind the
i forward wall was anything but en
joyable to the harassed Jaysee ball-
I toters.
hTe major part of the opening
I quarter was played in Los Angeles
I territory. Some long punting on the
part of Ross for Ihe Southerners
was nullified by Bowles' brilliant
returns.
Flannagan Stops Drive
In the third quarter Los Angeles |
started a drive from their own half
of the field that was halted by Man)- j
nagan's interception of a pass on his j
45-yard line. A punting duel ensued
that resulted in Stanford's favor,
when Bowles returned 17 yards to ,
the Jaysee 38-yard mark. Then
, Bowles drove off-tackle for six j
yards.
Here Moore put on a special ex
hibition by himself, scrambling 16
yards off right tackle. The play was
repeated, and though the Cardinal
interference melted away at the line
of scrimmage, this chunky fighter,
Moore, squirmed and wrenched his 1
body away from the hands of a half- |
, dozen tacklers until he fell with the j
i pigskin over the goal.
After the kick-off, which Los An- |
geles elected to receive, a fumble !
and a series of bad passes from cen- j
ter gave the ball to the Stanford i
Babes on the Jaysee 18-yard mark, j
The frosh required but three plays j
J to cross the goal lino, with Rothert's j
j pass to Seaver that netted 16 yards I
' the scoring effort.
