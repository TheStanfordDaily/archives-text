# B.A.C. MAKES LARGE OUTLAY FOR THREE STADIUM CHANGES
## 
### 
Old returning students have un- !
doubtedly noticed a few changes in
their familiar stadium haunt. All. of
this cost the B.A.C. some and
occupied about two and a half
months.
Most noticeable are the new con
crete stairways put in during the
summer, which are designed to
withstand a good many Big Game
and U.S.C. crowds. Perhaps first in
convenience will prove to be the 14,
new rest rooms all around the rim
at a high level, making for a mini
mum of stair-climbing.
Another innovation*is the auto- !
matic control of the time clock. Pre- 1
viously operated by hand behind the ;
scoreboard, the timepiece is now
automatically regulated from the
field timer's stopwatch. This allows ;
for exact representation of the cor
rect remaining time of play, as all
"times out" automatically stop the
clock, which remains correct to the j
second.
