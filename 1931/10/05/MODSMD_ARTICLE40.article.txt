California's varsity may not look
particularly brilliant, as yet at least,
but make no mistake about those
frosh. They have gridiron IT.
| Big, fast, powerful, they look un
beatable. In their game with a not
weak Fullerton Junior College
eleven Saturday afternoon, they
paraded one team after another onto
the "field, each looking as strong as
I the other. The final score was 43 to 0.
When the third or fourth team
| trooped onto the field, Walt Hein
-1 ecke, scouting the game for Coach
' "Rabbit" Bradshaw of our own
! yearlings, gave vent to a sigh as the
: touchdowns continued to pile up.
"They look like too much for
us," was Walt's comment after
the game. "The third team looks
as good as the lirst. Their only
apparent weakness is on pass
defense." j
Using an ordinary tandem forma
tion, the rangy Cubs showed great
power in off-tackle slants and shots
through the center of the line. Nor
were they lacking in speed. In the
1 fourth quarter, for instance, Ernest
I Shamlin, diminutive quarterback
j from Oakland Roosevelt high, got
! loose to run from midfield for a
! touchdown without a hand being
laid on him. And he plays with the
j THIRD team!
When Bill Ingram scrimmaged
j these frosh against the varsity on
I September 19, the yearlings pushed
; the Bears all over the field. At that
' time it was thought merely a sign of
j varsity weakness. Now it is apparent
| that it was just as much a demon
stration of freshman power.
And when those babes grow lip —
! look out!
! —
Minnesota may be without the
services of one of their star half
backs, Quentin Bur dick, when
the Gophers meet the Indians in
the Stadium Saturday. Burdick
wrenched his left knee in the
Oklahoma Aggie game Saturday,
and wire reports indicate that
it is almost a certainty that he
will be unable to play.
The Gophers entrained for
the coast immediately follow
ing their 20 to 0 win over the
, Aggies Saturday, and will reach
the coast tomorrow morning.

When the third or fourth team
| trooped onto the field, Walt Hein
-1 ecke, scouting the game for Coach
' "Rabbit" Bradshaw of our own
! yearlings, gave vent to a sigh as the
: touchdowns continued to pile up.
"They look like too much for
us," was Walt's comment after
the game. "The third team looks
as good as the lirst. Their only
apparent weakness is on pass
defense." j
Using an ordinary tandem forma
tion, the rangy Cubs showed great
power in off-tackle slants and shots
through the center of the line. Nor
were they lacking in speed. In the
1 fourth quarter, for instance, Ernest
I Shamlin, diminutive quarterback
j from Oakland Roosevelt high, got
! loose to run from midfield for a
! touchdown without a hand being
laid on him. And he plays with the
j THIRD team!
When Bill Ingram scrimmaged
j these frosh against the varsity on
I September 19, the yearlings pushed
; the Bears all over the field. At that
' time it was thought merely a sign of
j varsity weakness. Now it is apparent
| that it was just as much a demon
stration of freshman power.
And when those babes grow lip —

Minnesota may be without the
services of one of their star half
backs, Quentin Bur dick, when
the Gophers meet the Indians in
the Stadium Saturday. Burdick
wrenched his left knee in the
Oklahoma Aggie game Saturday,
and wire reports indicate that
it is almost a certainty that he
will be unable to play.
The Gophers entrained for
the coast immediately follow
ing their 20 to 0 win over the
, Aggies Saturday, and will reach
the coast tomorrow morning.
