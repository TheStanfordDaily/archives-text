# QUAKER CITY SABBATH CALM SHATTERED AS TEAMS PRACTICE FOR THIRD GAME
## 
### 
| PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4 (JP). —,
The Sabbath calm that usually rests j
j so heavily upon Philadelphia was j
! shattered today by the rattle of base ;
knocks and the shouts of infielders
at play, something unprecedented in j
the history of baseball in this city- J
I The world champion Athletics and j
the St. Louis Cardinals were prac- I
i ticing for the thild game of the j
! world series tomorrow at Shibe
1 Park.
To further disrupt the placidity of i
the day, the excitement of the citi- I
zens mounted steadily as the Cardi- i
nals, trailing the big baseball cara- j
van in from the first two games in
St. Louis, arrived this morning
bristling with confidence and de
, termination to smash the domination

of the American Leaguers over the
past five years of the annual post
season classics.
They hustled out to Shibe Park,
boasting that the sensational come
back that brought them a 2 to 0
victory in the second game Friday
after the Athletics had taken the
opener 6 to 2, would prevail through
the three games starting here to
morrow.
For two hours, from 1 to 3 p.m.,
the Cards raced through the batting
and fielding drill, following the A's,
who held the field from 11 a.m. until
the National League champions took
over.
