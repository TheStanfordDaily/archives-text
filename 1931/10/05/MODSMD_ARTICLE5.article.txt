# Butler Denies He Will Become Conference Czar
## Duties Consist of Investigating Athletic Conditions And Making a Final Report 
### 
fTHE belief that Jonathan A. Butler, former aide to Commissioner John L.
Griffiths of the Big Ten, will become '"Czar'' of Pacific Coast football
is entirely false.
This was emphatically asserted yesterday by Butler, who arrived here
a few days ago to begin a one year survey of athletic conditions in the
Pacific Coast Conference. Butler scoffed at the idea of becoming football
"czar." "Rumors that I am to become commissioner or "czar" of the
Pacific Coast Conference arc absolutely erroneous," declared Butler. "My
duties arc only to investigate ath-?

letic conditions here and make a re- ]
port to the conference at the end of j
the year. I have 110 executive power !
whatsoever."
Butler was chosen to make this j
survey last June by a conference I
committee headed by Professor j
Owens, president of the conference J
and Stanford faculty athletic repie- l
sentative. He has served in a simi- j
lar manner for the past five years ;
under Major Griffiths, commissioner j
of the Big Ten.
Butler will remain at Stanford |
for a few days prior to making a j
tour of the schools in the conference j
for the purpose of acquainting him- j
self with the situation. His head- 1
quarters will probably be in San j
Francisco.
