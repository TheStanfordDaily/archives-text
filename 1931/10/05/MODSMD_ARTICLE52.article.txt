The spectre of Racial Preju
dice made its appearance in
the Stadium Saturday to the
amusement of (what Don Lie
hendorfer estimated as) 24,000
grid disciples.
Sociology seems to have
missed its stamp of tolerance on
the local yell leaders.
The result brought a snort

(wiggly line indicates hall, dot
ted line shows flight of Stan
ford man, X marks the spot)
"Huh," huhhed the Berkeley
mentor, "don't be too sure of
that lady."
For the burden of proof rest

leader, when lie announced
through the megaphone that
ushers had retrieved a pair of
"White lady's gloves," which
objects were to be had on ap
plication for same.
