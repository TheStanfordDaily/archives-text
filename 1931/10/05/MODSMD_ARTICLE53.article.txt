WEST ORANGE, N.J., Oct. 4. (/P)
—Anxiety increased throughout the
world today as Thomas A. Edison
continued to grow weaker.
"Mr. Edison is gradually losing
strength," said a bulletin issued by
his physician, Dr. Hubert S. Howe.
"He did not have a good night. It is
increasingly difficult for him to take
nourishment."
Messages of solicitude came from
far and near, including two cables
from Pope Pius XI asking for latest
reports on the inventor's condition.
The stamina that buoyed up the
"wizard" during a long lifetime of
labor appeared to be ebbing away
under the onslaught of a four-fold
ailment. He has been suffering with
uremic poisoning, gastric ulcers,
diabetes, and Bright's disease.
An attacak of indigestion late Fri
day added to the gravity of his con
dition.
The messages from the Vatican
were disclosed this afternoon and
recalled the occasion last year when
Edison sent a richly decorated dic
tating device of his invention to the
Pope. Later the Pope sent him a gold
medal.
