DEAR SIS:—
Football season has us all agog. We sim
ply have to have a new outfit for every game.
Saturday we are wearing our new polo coats
(they are just the thing!) Roos Bros, features
them in genuine camel's hair and rich soft
tweeds—for only $25.
And say! Have you seen the new
"Roughie" pajamas? Soft and comfy—fine to
wear a-studying!
Toodleoo,
CO-ED.
