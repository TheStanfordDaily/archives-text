# DEATH TAKES U.S. SENATOR D.W.MORROW
## Cerebral Hemorrhage Fatal To Father-in-Law of Col. Lindbergh 
### 
ENGLEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 5. f/P)—
] Senator Dwight W. Morrow, 58, died
I in his sleep today at the peak of a
: career which carried him into inter
; national prominence as a financier
I and diplomat.
A secretary tried in vain to awak
en the New Jersey Senator late in
the morning and then called physi
| cians. Although Morrow lived for
two more hours, he never regained
; consciousness, and died at 1:52 p.m.
j of a cerebral hemorrhage.
No Hint of Death
The news of his death was in—
i tensified by its unexpectedness. The
1 father-in-law of Colonel Charles A.
' Lindbergh, who was a partner in
! the Morgan banking house until he
; resigned to become Ambassador to
; Mexico, appeared in excellent health
last night as he addressed a large
! gathering in New York and was
j cheered by 1200 men and women
j for his advice about welfare work.
The passing of the man who had
j poured oil on the troubled waters
j of Mexico with his doctrine of cour-
I tesy, patience, and understanding
between nations, removed one of the
country's foi-emost advocates of pro
hibition repeal.
Mentioned for President
Morrow frequently had been
; mentioned as a possible candidate
I for President or Vice President in
1932, and was a leader on whom
i New Jersey Republicans had ex
| pected to lean heavily in the turbu
| lent campaign now being waged for
: the office of Governor.
I His death placed in the hands of
Morgan F. Lawson, Republican
Governor of New Jersey, the power
| to preserve the Republican's one
-1 vote margin in the United States
Senate. He will name a successor
who will hold office until the gen
eral election in 1932 or until a spe
cial election is called.
