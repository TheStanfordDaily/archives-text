i Secret practice was the order of
j the day and Captain Butch Cleanser
beat up the coach for peeping. The
| fool coach got himself into a stew
j and so meat was the main dish at
j training table.
A series of line plunging featured
the first few minutes, but, the cap
tain, unfortunately, pulled the plug
instead of a reverse. Both teams
i swam ashore. The teams shifted in
J the old manner several times, and
then one of the guards used the New
! Free Heeling and knocked out seven
' mn before they could ge f the shoe
out of his hand. Charges of profes
sionalism hit the squad at the last
of practice and they all sat down to
| brood and brood. This availed them

not at all, the little toads, and I
regret to say that eggs are still 42
cents a dozen.
THE STANFORD DAILY
They opened up practice by
sweeping around left end and over
tackle and then the vacuum cleaner
broke down. During signal practice
their star end got lost in the dust,
and when they found him he'd been
dead for hours. This affair raised
an awful row on the field.
The fullback hit the line three
times before the dumb insect caught
on, After they cut him down the
doctor pronounced him dead and
the warden said that burial would
be taken care of by near (sighted)
relatives. Eleven men went into the
huddle, but only three came out.
