# Maloney Attacks Committee For Dropping Rugby
## La-Crosse Substituted In Olympic Games 
### 
Harry Maloney, minor sports di
rector, yesterday issued a statement
flaying the Organizations Committee
of the 1932 Olympic Games for its
action in dropping rugby in favor of
la-crosse.
Maloney had intended to enter a
Stanford team in the rugby compe
tition when the games were held at
Los Angeles next year, but his plans
were blasted by the action of the
committee. '
Pointing out that rugby is an in
ternational sport, Maloney, a recog
nized authority on the game, said
that la-crosse is played only in the
eastern part of the United States
and in Canada, but little, if any, in
Europe.
In showing that la-crosse is of ex
tremely minor importance, Maloney
stated that rugby football is played
in over twelve countries, including
our own. The American Olympic
Association was asked over a year
ago to consider rugby football for
the 1932 program. Eastern Canada,
Western Canada, and Japan had
each promised a team and with the
wealth of material in the United
States and the European countries
a good contest was expected.
"With this in mind," concluded
Maloney, "the Organizing Commit
tee should give some thought to the
athletes who are coming to put on
the show for them by making their
program as representative as pos
sible. To leave such an important
event as rugby football off the pro
gram is likely to lose favor with the
people in the countries in which this
sterling game is played.* 1 Unless this
is avoided, the 1931 Olympic Games
of 1932 might go down in history as
being anything but a success."
