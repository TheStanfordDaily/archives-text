### 
Wash., Oct. 5. (/P)-The longest ocean flight ever made
by man was completed today when Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Hern
don, Jr., skidded and rocked a wheelless plane to a dizzy stop at tin
airport here, 41 hours and 13 minutes after taking ofT from Samushiro
beach, Japan. Edging his way through the crowd at the field was a
Japanese newspaper reporter, who handed the flyers a $25,000 check,

issued by a Tokyo paper, for the
first successful nonstop flight be
tween Japan and the United States.

'"Very glad to see you, boys," he
shouted.
Herndon and Pangborn were in
their stocking l'eet as they climbed
from the plane.
"Give me a cigarette," Herndon
requested.
Pangborn laughed.
"We have been in Japan so long
we're still going barefooted."
Tc lighten their load the aviators
had dropped their landing gear soon
after taking oft' from the Japanese
island at 2:01 p.m. (P.S.T.) Satur
day.
Herndon Hurt
They smashed their propellor and
Herndon received a nasty gash over
his eye when the plane jolted to the
ground here at 7:14 a.m. (P.S.T.).
They had completed a flight of
nearly 5000 miles, which is regarded
as one of the most dangerous ever
attempted.
Pangborn, piloting on the flight,
appeai'ed more tired and shaky
than his 21-year-old companion.
But the youthful wealthy New Yox - k
sportsman-aviator admitted he was
"wobbly" as their automobile picked
its way through a jam of cars to the
Cascadian Hotel, three miles from
the field.
Two moments of terror in the
flight, when they thought they
would never get through, were re
counted by the flyers.
Ice Forms on Wings
Ice on the wings, most dreaded
danger faced by flyers in Northern
climes, almost brought their flight
to an untimely end soon after they
left Japan. Then, over the southern
end of the Gulf of Alaska, their en
gine stopped running for several
minutes when one gasoline tank un
expectedly went dry.
After flying about 1000 miles they
ran into heavy clouds oft' the Aleu
tian islands at daybreak yesterday.
"Ice began forming on the wings
and the plane got loggy, but we
finally flew through it," Herndon
.said.
Gas Tank Runs Dry
Late yesterday, when they were
about 3000 miles from Japan the
engine sputtered and finally came
to a dead stop because one gas tank
was dry.
"We didn't expect it then and it
was several minutes before we
hooked up with the extra gas tank,"
:;aid young Herndon.

from the plane.
"Give me a cigarette," Herndon
requested.
Pangborn laughed.
"We have been in Japan so long
we're still going barefooted."
Tc lighten their load the aviators
had dropped their landing gear soon
after taking oft' from the Japanese
island at 2:01 p.m. (P.S.T.) Satur
day.
Herndon Hurt
They smashed their propellor and
Herndon received a nasty gash over
his eye when the plane jolted to the
ground here at 7:14 a.m. (P.S.T.).
They had completed a flight of
nearly 5000 miles, which is regarded
as one of the most dangerous ever
attempted.
Pangborn, piloting on the flight,
appeai'ed more tired and shaky
than his 21-year-old companion.
But the youthful wealthy New Yox - k
sportsman-aviator admitted he was
"wobbly" as their automobile picked
its way through a jam of cars to the
Cascadian Hotel, three miles from
the field.
Two moments of terror in the
flight, when they thought they
would never get through, were re
counted by the flyers.
Ice Forms on Wings
Ice on the wings, most dreaded
danger faced by flyers in Northern
climes, almost brought their flight
to an untimely end soon after they
left Japan. Then, over the southern
end of the Gulf of Alaska, their en
gine stopped running for several
minutes when one gasoline tank un
expectedly went dry.
After flying about 1000 miles they
ran into heavy clouds oft' the Aleu
tian islands at daybreak yesterday.
"Ice began forming on the wings
and the plane got loggy, but we
finally flew through it," Herndon
.said.
Gas Tank Runs Dry
Late yesterday, when they were
about 3000 miles from Japan the
engine sputtered and finally came
to a dead stop because one gas tank
was dry.
"We didn't expect it then and it
was several minutes before we
hooked up with the extra gas tank,"
:;aid young Herndon.
Wash., Oct. 5. (/P)-The longest ocean flight ever made
by man was completed today when Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Hern
don, Jr., skidded and rocked a wheelless plane to a dizzy stop at tin
airport here, 41 hours and 13 minutes after taking ofT from Samushiro
beach, Japan. Edging his way through the crowd at the field was a
Japanese newspaper reporter, who handed the flyers a $25,000 check,

issued by a Tokyo paper, for the
first successful nonstop flight be
tween Japan and the United States.

'"Very glad to see you, boys," he
shouted.
Herndon and Pangborn were in
their stocking l'eet as they climbed
from the plane.
