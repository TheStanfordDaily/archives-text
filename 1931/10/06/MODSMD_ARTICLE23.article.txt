NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 5. t/P)
—Yale University's operating ex
penses and cost of building con
struction during the year 1931-32
will be about $22,000,000, it was said
tonight by Thomas W. Farnham,
associate treasurer and controller
of the university, speaking at a
meeting in City Hall to plan un
employment relief during the win
ter.
"The amount of construction work
at Yale University has remained
about the same during the last six
months and will probably be main
tained at nearly this rate for twelve
months to come, allowing for sea
sonal fluctuations," Farnum said.
"In March approximately 1800 men
were employed on Yale buildings.
"This number increased to 2100 in
April, declined to 1700 in June, rose
again in July, and reached a high
point of 221.7 on August 31, the
latest date for \tfhich a report is
available. It may be expected that
employment will continue at about
the present rate until cold weather
hampers outdoor work, when there
will be a temporary decline.
"At the same time that the num
ber employed has increased, the
proportion of nonresidents has de
creased, until it is nowiless than 0
per cent. By nonresidents are meant
those who have lived in the city for
six months or less and those who
commute from nearby places."
