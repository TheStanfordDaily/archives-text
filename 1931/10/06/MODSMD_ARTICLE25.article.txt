# WARNER HOLDS GOPHER CLASH ANYBODY'S TILT
## Sees Indian Chances Only Even For Victory In Minnesota Game EASTERNERS ARRIVE Lambert Gets Berth With Starting Backfield 
### Lowell Cox 
"It looks like anybody's ball
game!''
So declared Coach "Pop' Warner
last night concerning Saturday's ap
proaching intersectional clash with
the Gophers of Minnesota. "There is
no reason for Stanford being made:
the favorite, when there is every in
dication that the game will be a
tough battle," continued the Old
Man- "Last year, in spite of any
thing I could say, we were installed
big favorites, while I knew we were
up against a tough proposition."
A tough proposition it proved to
be, with the Gophers making a val
iant stand to hold the Indians to a
scoreless tie. That Minnesota will be
even harder to stop this year is indi
cated by word Warner has received
from friends in the Middle West
who have seen the Gophers in ac
tion.
Hefty Team
"I am told they have one of the
heaviest, if not the heaviest team in
the Big Ten," Warner said. "We arc
not much better this year than last,
while they are reported greatly im
proved. Yes, it looks like a tough
battle."
A big surprise was Warner's an
nouncement that he will start Lam
bert at right half Saturday. It was
expected that Ernie Caddel, who
was shifted yesterday from fullback
to half, would draw the starting as
signment.
Allen to Start
The remainder of the backfield
which Pop indicated he will start
includes Moflatt at left halfback,
Allen at full, and Captain Harry
Hillman at quarterback.
While there is a possibility that
Warner will change his mind before
the week is over, it is a certainty
that Lambert will at least see plenty
of service against the Gophers. Ho
turned in an .excellent account o£
himself in the Santa Clara game,
carrying the ball 4 times for a total
of 27 yards, an average of nearly
seven yards each try-
Open Attack Indicated
With Allen, the squad's best pass
er, starting, Warner doubtless is lay
ing plans for an early air raid and
an open attack, rather than an at
tempt to go places through that
beefy Minnesota line.
Rintala and Caddel, who have
traded positions, were introduced to
their new duties at fullback and
right half, respectively, in a scrim
mage yesterday. Together with La
combe at left half and Jack Hillman
at quarter, they worked behind a
mixed line against the Greys.
Caddel is more at home at hall
than at full, but the 30-minute ses
sion indicated that Rintala will need
a little time to get used to his new
post.
The remainder of the squad took
it comparatively easy in yesterday's
session. Warner gave a chalk talk
and introduced several new plays.
Gribben and Clark are still on the
injured list, while George Grey, who
hurt his ankle in the Bronco contest,
wasn't in uniform yesterday. Allen
and Colvin, however, both of whom
received minor injuries Saturday,
worked out with the squad.
Gophers Arrive Today
Minnesota will arrive at Oakland
today and will make their head
quarters at the Hotel Leamington.

A tough proposition it proved to
be, with the Gophers making a val
iant stand to hold the Indians to a
scoreless tie. That Minnesota will be
even harder to stop this year is indi
cated by word Warner has received
from friends in the Middle West
who have seen the Gophers in ac
tion.
Hefty Team
"I am told they have one of the
heaviest, if not the heaviest team in
the Big Ten," Warner said. "We arc
not much better this year than last,
while they are reported greatly im
proved. Yes, it looks like a tough
battle."
A big surprise was Warner's an
nouncement that he will start Lam
bert at right half Saturday. It was
expected that Ernie Caddel, who
was shifted yesterday from fullback
to half, would draw the starting as
signment.
Allen to Start
The remainder of the backfield
which Pop indicated he will start
includes Moflatt at left halfback,
Allen at full, and Captain Harry
Hillman at quarterback.
While there is a possibility that
Warner will change his mind before
the week is over, it is a certainty
that Lambert will at least see plenty
of service against the Gophers. Ho
turned in an .excellent account o£
himself in the Santa Clara game,
carrying the ball 4 times for a total
of 27 yards, an average of nearly
seven yards each try-
Open Attack Indicated
With Allen, the squad's best pass
er, starting, Warner doubtless is lay
ing plans for an early air raid and
an open attack, rather than an at
tempt to go places through that
beefy Minnesota line.
Rintala and Caddel, who have
traded positions, were introduced to
their new duties at fullback and
right half, respectively, in a scrim
mage yesterday. Together with La
combe at left half and Jack Hillman
at quarter, they worked behind a
mixed line against the Greys.
Caddel is more at home at hall
than at full, but the 30-minute ses
sion indicated that Rintala will need
a little time to get used to his new
post.
The remainder of the squad took
it comparatively easy in yesterday's
session. Warner gave a chalk talk
and introduced several new plays.
Gribben and Clark are still on the
injured list, while George Grey, who
hurt his ankle in the Bronco contest,
wasn't in uniform yesterday. Allen
and Colvin, however, both of whom
received minor injuries Saturday,
worked out with the squad.
Gophers Arrive Today
Minnesota will arrive at Oakland
today and will make their head
quarters at the Hotel Leamington.
"It looks like anybody's ball
game!''
So declared Coach "Pop' Warner
last night concerning Saturday's ap
proaching intersectional clash with
the Gophers of Minnesota. "There is
no reason for Stanford being made:
the favorite, when there is every in
dication that the game will be a
tough battle," continued the Old
Man- "Last year, in spite of any
thing I could say, we were installed
big favorites, while I knew we were
up against a tough proposition."
