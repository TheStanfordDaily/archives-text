Xine women sponsors, live from the Row and four from
Roble, have in their hands, to a definite extent, the respon
sibility of making the freshman women's and Ihe new
women transfers' first weeks of adjustment to the soeial
and scholastic life of the t'niversity a successful one.
Sponsors are not by any means figure heads. Whether
ii new woman will receive her modicum of happiness here,
or whether she will be discouraged and homesick, may
depend directly upon her contact with sympathy, tact,, and
counsel from a sponsor.
To be chosen as sponsor is considered an honor and a
privilege—one that is rarely discredited by its attainer.
Nevertheless, a faint shadow is sometimes cast upon the
work of the sponsor by an entirely separate aspect of the
sponsor - freshman relationship, which results subtly in
discrimination on the part of the sponsor from the Row, in
favor of the new women who are "possibilities." To some
degree this is unavoidable and relatively harmless. A high
minded sponsor is a sponsor first and a Row woman a very
small second.
Rut when discrimination does occur, the freshmen who
are not possibilities suffer neglect, and the good feeling
among the houses is jeopardized. Sometimes a sponsor
feels tin unspoken pressure from the house to which she
belongs—a pressure reaching her through something in the
nttitude of the members, that is a mixture of pride in her
distinction and a sort of hopefulness and expectation. This
attitude is not fair to the sponsor. Her task is difficult
enough without a double burden. She should be free to
be as impartial and disinterested in her service as possible,
and she is not free when she feels that her house is de
pending upon her for the success of its rushing season.
