Apparently Stanford is not the only university that is
troubled by outsiders sneaking into football games via
I heir friends' student body cards. A recent editorial in the
I'niversitij of Washinyton Daily laments the fact that such
ii condition exists there and further bemoans the methods
that the A.S.U.W. officials have inaugurated to check the
practice.
There each student must duplicate his signature on bis
student body card as he passes through the gates of the
stadium, a system editorially described us ". . . a distaste! ul
insult to the intelligence and honesty of every student."
In spite of the fact that the system produces excellent
results as far as limiting the use of student body cards to
their respective owners, its reprehensible features have
aroused students to action. In an attempt to devise a more
feasible plan the president of Ihe student body has ap
pointed a committee which will work independently of the
graduate manager.
The editor further comments on the committee: "With
such a ticklish matter of principle involved, this newly ap
pointed committee should get to work immediately, ferret
out ideas and act independently of the office of the gradu
ate manager, report their findings, whether they be to the
liking of everyone or not, then see that something is done
to remcdv a decidedlv disagreeable posture of affairs."
