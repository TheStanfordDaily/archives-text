Ail enterprising feminine columnist at the University
of Washington saw lit to comment in her daily "funny"
. strip on the traditional garb of the Stanford rough as
follows:
". . . one day, while riding about the sunny bridle-paths
ol Palo Alio, she (;i fair Washingtonian) ran into a couple
of Stanford men out for a stroll. The horse, whose name
■was Herbert, immediately became so frightened at their j
unkempt appearance that he threw Hetty (the said Wash
ingtonian) and loped home lo his stable."
II seems also that last year some Washington rowdy, j
apparently insensible to the more delicate requirements i
of a gentleman, appeared on the Northern campus in
broad daylight wearing a sweater minus his shirt! The j
furor aroused was so great that this shocking display re
ceived space in the news columns of the paper.
Another degenerate of the same breed dared lo walk
into an eight o'clock wearing a pair of bedroom slippers
(Isk, Isk), causing the dainty gentlemen in the class to
nervously readjust their lies and flick the dust from their
carefully polished shoes with a silk handkerchief, won
dering "What is dear old Washington coming to?" This
juicy bit of scandal furnished a bull session topic for
weeks.
Let the Washington dandies revel in their affected fop
pishness if il appeals to them and let us give thanks that
we live in an atmosphere where a man can wear what
comfortably appeals to him without being thought a moral
and mental degenerate.
Long live the Stanford Rough!
