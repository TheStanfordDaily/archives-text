iVIY HEAR UNION—To whom it
may concern:
Several days ago the editor of the
Daily asked the Union to sell coffee
fcr live cents in a very decent sort
ol way. Of course, nothing was done.
We say of course, because so long
have Stanford students cried for five
cent java that it has become one of
the grand traditions of the Farm for
the Union Board to deny these cries.
In fact, five cent coffee has be
come something that Stanford asks
for with the same forlorness that
brokers ask the "market" to rise.
In the past, the arguments for a re
duced price on coffee have had not
much more validity than all argu
ments for lower prices—to-wit, Ihe
universal consumer's cry of, "We
want more for less."
Now, however, the situation has
changed. The great tycoons of eco
nomics claim that food costs have
come down at least ten per cent and
very possibly more. Now even the
Union cannot be immune to the laws
of economics. If costs come down ten
per cent —then in a non-profit or
ganization—prices should come
down ten per cent.
But, cry the five-centers, a ten
per cent reduction would make cof
fee sell at nine cents—four cents
higher than that golden ideal—real
ized only in dreams—and discusFHwl
on the fifth floor for years—five
cent eolTee. Now, Mr. Union, or Mrs.
Union, or Miss Union, would it not
be possible to maintain your present
price levels on all goods and reduce
coffee to five cents? Would not the
increased margin of ten per cent on
food in general more than compen

j sate for a five cent reduction in
1 coffee?
Union, why not act now? Why
| wait until so-called campus busy-
I bodies write scathing articles—still
| more bitter than old coffee— de
j manding sweeping investigations?
Why wait until campus statisticians
! "prove" that a co-operative store
j should sell for much less? Why wait
i until the Food Research Bureau is
' asked to study the matter? Why
' wait until nasty rumors drift from
| the Quad, the Law Steps, the Row,
and the halls, to the Daily, and
| thence to the eager San Francisco
, papers?
In other words, Union, why not
1 concede an inch graciously rather
than risk losing half a foot under
! stress? Why not try out five cent
| coffee for a month? It might change
| the Union into a highly respected
! and more frequently patronized
! place.
In any event, Union, why not ex
| plain your stand to the students?
j They may understand and sympa
; thize. Even the President answers
his critics. Please, dear Union, tell"
us why and wherefore. Remember,
if you will, that the editor's request
for five cent coffee is still un-
I answered.
Sincerely yours,
Abe Mellinkoff.
P.S.: My interest is purely altru
-1 istic because I most always drink
milk—to preserve my schoolgirl
! complexion—stop falling dandruff—
; and uplift sagging arches. Why not
1 everybody drink milk and stop all
J this coffee .talk at once?

iVIY HEAR UNION—To whom it
may concern:
Several days ago the editor of the
Daily asked the Union to sell coffee
fcr live cents in a very decent sort
ol way. Of course, nothing was done.
We say of course, because so long
have Stanford students cried for five
cent java that it has become one of
the grand traditions of the Farm for
the Union Board to deny these cries.
In fact, five cent coffee has be
come something that Stanford asks
for with the same forlorness that
brokers ask the "market" to rise.
In the past, the arguments for a re
duced price on coffee have had not
much more validity than all argu
ments for lower prices—to-wit, Ihe
universal consumer's cry of, "We
want more for less."
Now, however, the situation has
changed. The great tycoons of eco
nomics claim that food costs have
come down at least ten per cent and
very possibly more. Now even the
Union cannot be immune to the laws
of economics. If costs come down ten
per cent —then in a non-profit or
ganization—prices should come
down ten per cent.
But, cry the five-centers, a ten
per cent reduction would make cof
fee sell at nine cents—four cents
higher than that golden ideal—real
ized only in dreams—and discusFHwl
on the fifth floor for years—five
cent eolTee. Now, Mr. Union, or Mrs.
Union, or Miss Union, would it not
be possible to maintain your present
price levels on all goods and reduce
coffee to five cents? Would not the
increased margin of ten per cent on
food in general more than compen

j sate for a five cent reduction in
1 coffee?
Union, why not act now? Why
| wait until so-called campus busy-
I bodies write scathing articles—still
| more bitter than old coffee— de
j manding sweeping investigations?
Why wait until campus statisticians
! "prove" that a co-operative store
j should sell for much less? Why wait
i until the Food Research Bureau is
' asked to study the matter? Why
' wait until nasty rumors drift from
| the Quad, the Law Steps, the Row,
and the halls, to the Daily, and
| thence to the eager San Francisco
, papers?
In other words, Union, why not
1 concede an inch graciously rather
than risk losing half a foot under
! stress? Why not try out five cent
| coffee for a month? It might change
| the Union into a highly respected
! and more frequently patronized
! place.
In any event, Union, why not ex
| plain your stand to the students?
j They may understand and sympa
