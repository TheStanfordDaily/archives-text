GIRL CRAZY—At the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.

'"Girl Crazy'' is much more pleas
ing entertainment than the usual
run of New York musical comedy
that finds its devious way to San
Francisco.
The first act starts ofT with a bang
with (he best piece of music in the
show, ü ßidin' My Time," but slows
down lamentably toward the end of
(he act. However, the Four Sequoi
ans singing their lazy song between
the scenes would make a far duller
act bearable.
The second act moves with a bet
ter tempo and is marked by ex
cellent chorus work, with the danc
ing and costumes better than aver
age. Among the principals Adele
Rowland, playing the part of the
cabaret singer, stands out far above
the others. She has a real stage
presence which the others seem to
lack.
The comic elements in the show
are excellent, although difficulties
with the lighting system marred
two blackouts which had great
promise.
Taken as a whole this is good en
tertainment and worth the price
even in these times of depression.

ON THE # SPOT—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.

It was a case of too many brothels
spoiling the cook. Tony Perelli tried
to remove competitors, thereby
smoothing the running of his racket,
interest the blonde siren, and think
fast enough to keep his hands out
of Commissioner Kelly's cuffs, all
at the same time,
Consequently Tony didn't see
everything that he ought to have
seen. So Minn Lee killed herself
and Tony, ironically enough, was
hung for the cne murder he didn't
commit.
'"On the Spot" is melodrama, writ
ten and played easily and unseri
ously. Crane Wilbur's Tony is com
pletely and cooly unscrupulous.
Anna May Wong wears beautiful
gowns, poses statuesquely, and has
the loveliest speaking voice we've
ever heard in the theatre. Her role,
Oriental as it is, suggesting rather
than expressing emotion, is difficult
to judge, surrounded as it is by pro
fane white emotionalists. Glenda
Farrell wavers somewhat, but is
convincingly unrefined. The rest of
the cast is very mediocre, with the
exception of Maurice Black and
Clifford Dempsey, who are amusing,

Exciting, entertaining, recom
mended. —J. S. S.

! MONKEY BUSINESS—At the Stan
lord Theatre.

Jumping from one scene to the
other in fast-moving style, the Marx
brothers, in tl»eir usual fashion,
fling pantomime and repartee at the
i audience as fast as they can manu
facture it. "Unconscious" as usual,
the quartet has produced another
rollicking entertainer for those who
appreciate the high art of Marxian
abandonment. There are few slow
| spots in the comedy, and a good
part of the dialogue is almost too
fast to catch in passing, although
quite worth while when caught,
j "Harpo" is to be commended for
some of his pantomime work.
—R. V. W.

China's population is 474,787,000.

GIRL CRAZY—At the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.

'"Girl Crazy'' is much more pleas
ing entertainment than the usual
run of New York musical comedy
that finds its devious way to San
Francisco.
The first act starts ofT with a bang
with (he best piece of music in the
show, ü ßidin' My Time," but slows
down lamentably toward the end of
(he act. However, the Four Sequoi
ans singing their lazy song between
the scenes would make a far duller
act bearable.
The second act moves with a bet
ter tempo and is marked by ex
cellent chorus work, with the danc
ing and costumes better than aver
age. Among the principals Adele
Rowland, playing the part of the
cabaret singer, stands out far above
the others. She has a real stage
presence which the others seem to
lack.
The comic elements in the show
are excellent, although difficulties
with the lighting system marred
two blackouts which had great
promise.
Taken as a whole this is good en
tertainment and worth the price
even in these times of depression.

ON THE # SPOT—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.

It was a case of too many brothels
spoiling the cook. Tony Perelli tried
to remove competitors, thereby
smoothing the running of his racket,
interest the blonde siren, and think
fast enough to keep his hands out
of Commissioner Kelly's cuffs, all
at the same time,
Consequently Tony didn't see
everything that he ought to have
seen. So Minn Lee killed herself
and Tony, ironically enough, was
hung for the cne murder he didn't
commit.
'"On the Spot" is melodrama, writ
ten and played easily and unseri
ously. Crane Wilbur's Tony is com
pletely and cooly unscrupulous.
Anna May Wong wears beautiful
gowns, poses statuesquely, and has
the loveliest speaking voice we've
ever heard in the theatre. Her role,
Oriental as it is, suggesting rather
than expressing emotion, is difficult
to judge, surrounded as it is by pro
fane white emotionalists. Glenda
Farrell wavers somewhat, but is
convincingly unrefined. The rest of
the cast is very mediocre, with the
exception of Maurice Black and
Clifford Dempsey, who are amusing,

Exciting, entertaining, recom
mended. —J. S. S.

! MONKEY BUSINESS—At the Stan
lord Theatre.

Jumping from one scene to the
other in fast-moving style, the Marx
brothers, in tl»eir usual fashion,
fling pantomime and repartee at the
i audience as fast as they can manu
facture it. "Unconscious" as usual,
the quartet has produced another
rollicking entertainer for those who
appreciate the high art of Marxian
abandonment. There are few slow
| spots in the comedy, and a good
part of the dialogue is almost too
fast to catch in passing, although
quite worth while when caught,
j "Harpo" is to be commended for
some of his pantomime work.
