We encountered a rough escorting
a French student around the cam
pus yesterday, and realizing that the
French student probably had learned
his English from grammars as atro
cious as our French texts, we
sneaked up to hear the dialogue. It
went something like this:
This is the chapel. All the tourists
some to look at the chapel. To what
ether places of interest are visitors
attracted? The visitors also go to
fee the home of Herbert Hoover.
President of the United States. And
who are these strange men in dirty
pants? Why, they are roughs (stu
dents). One learns many democratic
customs here in America.
What facilities for recreation do
students in America have? Why,
they go to football games. How is
that sport played? Eleven men carry
a ball in one direction and then
eleven others carry it in the oppo
site direction. That is very interest
ing. What else do American students
do? They take courses. How is that
done? First the professor tells the
students some facts and then the
students tell the professors these
facts. How entertaining. I believe I
shall like your college. I hope you
will. Good day!
"I thought you were out hitch
hiking. Whatsamatter?"
''Aw, I broke my thumb."
Caesar's ghost was returning to
the earth. The great scientist, Dr.
Holmes-Brown, had discovered the
secret of secrets, and Caesar himself
was being brought back. The world
had gathered for the glorious event;
television would flash the picture to
rich and poor, prince and laborer.
Thousands of celebrities were ready
for the welcome; zeppelins zoomed
overhead. Suddenly the Doctor's
electrical gates flew open.
As the expected visitant stepped
forth, the multitude moved neai'er.
But ahead were scurrying men with
pencils and paper. Reaching the
toga-clad figure first, they asked
slowly in awed tones:
"What do you think of prohibi
tion?"
