## A 						TOUGH LEAGUE 
### 
One conference team stands out
..hove all the rest on Stanford's
conference gridiron schedule—U.S.C.
That the Trojans are as much to be
feared as last year, in spite of their
loss to St. Mary's, was shown by
the 30 to 0 trimming they handed
Oregon State last Saturday.
"Aside from Southern Califor
nia, what conference team do
you think will give us the
toughest game this season?" we
asked "Pop" Warner the other
day. "Oregon State or Wash
ington?" we hazarded.
"Looks like they all would!"
was Pop's prompt retort. "Stan
ford is stronger this year than
last, but that doesn't ncccssarily
mean we will win more games.
It's a tough league."
Look them over. A week from
Saturday the Indians face Oregon
State in the conference opener. No
easy game may be expected here.
Coach Schissler is reputed to have
an even stronger eleven than the
combination which gave the Indians
;i scare last year. A hard game with
Minnesota this Saturday will make
matters no easier.
There is no rest for the weary,
and the following week will find
the Indians in Seattle for their
third consecutive major contest.
The Washington Husky is al
ways hard to heat at home, and
will he especially so this year,
with Jimmy Phelan getting or
ganized. A "breather" with
Idaho the week previous will aid
the Huskies in pointing for the
weary Stanford crew.
Returning to the campus, the In
dians will encounter a coming
U.C.L.A. outfit on October 31. Last
Saturday the Bruins surprised by
holding Washington State, confer
ence champions, to a 13 to 0 score.
With the fateful Trojan game billed
for the following week, it will un
doubtedly be up to the second team
to hold the fort.
following the Trojan game, the
Indians can relax for the only real
breather on the Stanford schedule,
which may be a formidable oppon
ent by that time, and the trip to
Cambridge for the Dartmouth con
test on November 28.
No wonder "Pop" says it's a lough
league!
"Casey" Kazanjian, former
Stanford athlete, will face
"Jumping Joe" Savoldi, Notre
Dame football player, in the fea
ture event of the wrestling card
at Dreamland in San Francisco
tonight. Kazanjian will be on
the short end of the odds, hut
is conceded a good chance to
win.

Returning to the campus, the In
dians will encounter a coming
U.C.L.A. outfit on October 31. Last
Saturday the Bruins surprised by
holding Washington State, confer
ence champions, to a 13 to 0 score.
With the fateful Trojan game billed
for the following week, it will un
doubtedly be up to the second team
to hold the fort.
following the Trojan game, the
Indians can relax for the only real
breather on the Stanford schedule,
which may be a formidable oppon
ent by that time, and the trip to
Cambridge for the Dartmouth con
test on November 28.
No wonder "Pop" says it's a lough
league!
"Casey" Kazanjian, former
Stanford athlete, will face
"Jumping Joe" Savoldi, Notre
Dame football player, in the fea
ture event of the wrestling card
at Dreamland in San Francisco
tonight. Kazanjian will be on
the short end of the odds, hut
is conceded a good chance to
win.
One conference team stands out
..hove all the rest on Stanford's
conference gridiron schedule—U.S.C.
That the Trojans are as much to be
feared as last year, in spite of their
loss to St. Mary's, was shown by
the 30 to 0 trimming they handed
Oregon State last Saturday.
"Aside from Southern Califor
nia, what conference team do
you think will give us the
toughest game this season?" we
asked "Pop" Warner the other
day. "Oregon State or Wash
ington?" we hazarded.
"Looks like they all would!"
was Pop's prompt retort. "Stan
ford is stronger this year than
last, but that doesn't ncccssarily
mean we will win more games.
It's a tough league."
Look them over. A week from
Saturday the Indians face Oregon
State in the conference opener. No
easy game may be expected here.
Coach Schissler is reputed to have
an even stronger eleven than the
combination which gave the Indians
;i scare last year. A hard game with
Minnesota this Saturday will make
matters no easier.
There is no rest for the weary,
and the following week will find
the Indians in Seattle for their
third consecutive major contest.
The Washington Husky is al
ways hard to heat at home, and
will he especially so this year,
with Jimmy Phelan getting or
ganized. A "breather" with
Idaho the week previous will aid
the Huskies in pointing for the
weary Stanford crew.
