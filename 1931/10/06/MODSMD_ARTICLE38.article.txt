# HILLMAN DELIVERS
## 
### 
One of the most encouraging
things about the Santa Clara game
Saturday was the great showing
made by Captain Harry Hillman. He
smacked the Bronc line 16 times,
failing to gain but once. He rolled
up a total of 44 yards, nearly three
yards to the crack.
While Hillman has been held on
the bench out of i*espect to his in
jured knee, Phil Baker has been
stealing his job, but Harry gave
notice Saturday that he is in con
dition to protect his rights.
As the plunging back goes, so go
Warner teams, and with Hillman
apparently at the top of his career,
Ihe Indians may go places before
the season is over. â€”L. M. C.
