# MEN'S COURTS OPEN MORNINGS, SATURDAY
## 
### 
Elwyn Bugge, instructor of tennis,
slated today that the men's courts
will not be thrown open to the
general public after 2 o'clock after
noons. This new ruling is very im
portant as the tennis classes are
unusually full this year, and all
the courts will be needed for the
classes.
Courts will lie open for general
use all day Saturday. Those who
play are requested to use the regu
lation court dress for tennis.
