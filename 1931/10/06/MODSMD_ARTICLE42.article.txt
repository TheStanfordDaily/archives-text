# Babes Smooth

### 
Contrast this seemingly one-man
aggregation with the smooth balance
cf the Cardinal freshmen. Moore,

a consistent ground-gainer of the
chunky, fighting type; Bowles,
clever, a trickster, and a constant
threat at quarter; Flannagan, a line
bruiser and good at defensive full;
Seaver ? who does a little of anything
well. Clever with the straight-arm
is this boy Seaver, as any know who
saw him bowl over four would-be
L.A. tacklers on a sweeping end
run Saturday. It will take clean
tackling to keep this husky Cardinal
on the turf.
