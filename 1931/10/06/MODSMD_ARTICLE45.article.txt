# BRILLIANT SUMMER VICTORIES MAY WIN DAVIS TEAM POST FOR GLEDHILL
## 
### BY RICHARD VAN WAGENEN 
GLEDHILL, Stanford racquet star and intercollegiate champion,
** may be a member of the Davis cup team next season.
Gledhill, who has just completed a long summer campaign, was inter
viewed when he visited the campus yesterday en route from the Berkeley
tournament for his home at Santa Barbara. He is not registered in the
University tr.is quarter, but will return in the winter.
The lanky star's chances of winning Davis Cup recognition are excel
lent. as he and Ellsworth Vines, national champion, arc expected to be

I Easthampton for the invitational
doubles, where the title fell again to
! the able Vines-Giedhill pair. A!
Seabright, the next scene of action,
j the Cardinal man managed to pass
Bruce Barnes but fell before Cliff
! Sutter in the quarterfinals. The
doubles compensated for this, how
, c ver, when the Vines-Gledhill team
| conquered a tough combination,
! John Doeg and George Lott, by the
astonishing score of 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 in
1 the semifinals, and then turned
around to cinch the title by forcing
Berkeley Bell and Gregory Mangin
into submission.
Another noteworthy victory came
in the Eastern Grass Court cham
pinoships at Rye, N.Y. This event
saw the two California boys pull
out a win from Lott and Van Ryn
in four sets. The two Westerners
i grabbed another doubles title soon
afterward at Newport.
Drop Nationals
The national doubles came next,
I their big chance. Something went
j wrong, however, and the California
I team failed to get past the quarter-
I finals, where they fell before the
rackets of Sutter and Barnes.
; Last of the Eastern tournaments
I for the Indian star was the national
I singles. First Yeomans, then Wil-<
[ liams, and then Davie Jones sub
: mitted to him, and then he met
I Frank Shields, ranked number two
i last year. This was his downfall,
| but not until five sets had been
! fought.
Loses to Perry
Coming West, Gledhill gained the

ranked second to Allison van Ryn *
I in doubles competition.
Early
i Gledhill began his summer cam- j
| paign during spring final examina
, tions, when he journeyed to Berke
ley to compete in the California j
championships, and survived but the >
first round of play. Paired with
Vines he was, however, victorious |
i in the two-man event.
Next we find him in Philadelphia, j
j where he rose to a peak in winning
the Intercollegiate singles title, de- J
1 fentinj Bruce Barnes of Texas in
j the finals. Third on the schedule
j came the National Clay Court cham
pionships, which saw the Cardinal
j netman advance to the final round,
j only to run up against Vines, who
j carried off the honors. Vines and !
I Gledhill then took the doubles title
from Berkeley Bell and Bruce
Barnes.

; ticular pride to the local star, for it ;

i seemingly colossal feat of trimming j
; Ellsworth Vines in straight sets, 7-5, :
j G-3, 6-0, to walk off the courts with |
{the Rhode Island state champion- t
j &hip and the distinction of being I
one of three men to down the na- j
tional champion this summer, j
Vines fell before George Lott in j
New Orleans and Fred Perry at the
iniersectional matches, but Gledhill j
claims the lone honor of putting '
cvei a love set, which is no mean
i accomplishment.
After Rhode Island came compe- j
iition for the famous Longwood j
j Bowl, where Stanford's representa- i
i live was eliminated in the two quar- !
j terfinals by Wilmer Allison. His j
and Vinci's combination in the two-
I man event, however, was a winner, j
conquering the Doeg-Coen team.
