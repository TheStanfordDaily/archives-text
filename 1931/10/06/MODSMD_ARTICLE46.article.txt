### 
By Dick Rodda
Fall basketball practice opened in
Ihe Pavilion yesterday afternoon, a
large turnout of last year's letter
men, together with the appearance
of a promising array of sophomores,
giving promise that Stanford's 1932
quintet will be stronger than that
of last season.
A total of 35 varsity men and 20
freshmen reported to Coach John
Bunn. The freshman squad will be
coached by Vance Fawcett, sensa
tional Cardinal guard last season.
In (ere lass Changed
"The preliminary training proce
dure will be somewhat changed this
year, ' Bunn said last night. The
regular interclass basketball tourna
ment will be a part of the practice.
"Any student eligible for varsity
competition will be allowed to try
out for one of the class teams, and
if enough men turn out, several
interclass leagues will be formed.
The teams will be coached by mem
bers of last season's varsity squad."
Bunn disclosed that half of the
squad of 30 men carried last season
were graduated in June, but that
this included only two of the regu
lar five, Vance Fawcett and Mike
Reynolds.
Smoother Team Expected
Bunn, who took over the position
of head Stanford basketball coach
only last season, also pointed out
that with a year's work already ac
complished, a better and smoother
working squad would be seen in
the early season games.
No definite squad can be picked
until footbali season is over. Moffatt,
Rintala, Baker, Dou'b, Lacombe,
Norgard, and Colvin will not join
the squad until the close of the
grid season.

semifinals of the Pacific Southwest
tournament, where he lost to Fred
| Perry, while Vines pushed on to
i capture the title. The doubles title
j fell, as usual, to Gledhill and his
I partner, after hurdling such ob
! stacles as Lott and Wood, and Alii -
i son and Van Ryn.
Lastly, the Pacific Coast cham
! pionships, which ended Sunday, saw
j Gledhill go as far as the quarter
| finals, only to come within a hair of
beating Perry, but failing, leaving
the task to Vines. Perry and Hughes
i beat the two youngsters in the
, doubles semifinals.
Match for Vines
Gledhill says he has less trouble
j with Vines than a good many other
| players, and realizes that if anyone
: has a chance against the national
; champion it is he, knowing Vinos's
I game so well. The champion, in rc
j turn, affirms that Gledhill is one of
I the toughest opponents he ever has
I to face.

more than six miles, where much
higher speeds can be attained.
