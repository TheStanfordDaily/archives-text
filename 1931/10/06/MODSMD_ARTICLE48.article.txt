# BURLEIGH GRIMES DEFEATS MACKS IN TWO HIT GAME
## 
### 
i SHIBE PARK, PHILADELPHIA,
Oct. 5. (/P) —The grizzled old war
| horse of the mound, Burleigh
! Grimes, whose twirling arm was
j supposed to be creaking, came out
with a two days growth of beard
today, held the Athletics to a pair
of hits, and pitched the Cardinals
into the lead for the baseball cham
pionship of the world.
I Witnessing World Series play for
the third straight year, President
Hoover was among nearly 33,000
spectators who saw Grimes come
close to a perfect masterpiece, as
he held the Athletics hitless for the
first seven innings, and beat them,
j 5 to 2, in the third game of a dra
-1 matie intersectional war. It was the
I same score by which Grove defeated
j Grimes in the first game of the 1930
! series.
Grimes was robbed of a shutout
j in the ninth inning when the mighty
A1 Simmons emerged from his
; slump to bang a home run over
the right field wall, with one on and
two oft, but the veteran spitballer
| subdued bis old time rivals with
i almost ridiculous ease up to thi.;
j final gesture by the home forces.
The Cardinals conquered none
■ other than the great Robert Grove
: as they bombarded the ace south
paw's delivery for the second
straight time in the series. Grimes,
jon top of his superlative pitching,
| .struck the blow in the fourth inning
1 that proved to be decisive. It was a
single, with two out, scoring run
i ners from second and third, and
| gave the Cardinals a commanding
j lead of 4 to 0.
