# SOCCER OUTLOOK BRIGHT DESPITE LOSS OF 9 VETS
## Captain Falk, Plumb, Washburn Head List of Regulars Returning; Schedule "Best in Years'" 
### BY FRANK LLOYD 
Reported to have some 18,000 en
: rolled within the confines of its
: ; piked iron fence, California boasted
I this year of the largest turnout for
J soccer in the history of that sport
at Berkeley. Harry Maloney, Stan
ford's sporting soccer coach, was
' justly proud when he found that
| the Farm's soccer squad topped the
! one at Berkeley by 10 men.
Although losing nine regulars
i from last season, both Maloney and
Captain Falk have only the most
optimistic outlook on the prospects
' for this season. It was seen at the
first practice held on Friday that
there were a great number of can
didates for every position on the
varsity which points to spirited
competition and resulting enthu
; siasm.
Forward Line Strong
Not entirely devoid of veteran
i material, Maloney's varsity will start
I off with a strong trio of veterans in
the center of the forward line with
; Captain Karl Falk, Arthur Hearns,
I and Larry Washburn.
Inside left will be well taken care
j of by Captain Falk who has been
i noted for his hard and fast play.
Hearn, who was the outstanding
frtar of last year's freshmen, is ex
| pected to show his wares at center
J forward. Ineligible last year, Wasli-
I burn, a junior, and captain and star
| of his freshman team, is back on
the job again with the near cer
tainty of a position in the forward
line where he played as a freshman.
Plumb Only Veteran Half
At halfback, Preston Plumb is the
only veteran returning and can be
counted on to fill one position. How
ever, it is reported that Menlo has
contributed a flashing center half to
the Indian soccer fold, in which case
! the second line .. *ould be well taken
I care of.
It was thought that the fullback
j position would be especially weak
I from pre-season indications. How
i ever, with the return of Buster

Holmes, a capable back of a few
years past, and the shifting of Brek
elbaum from goal guard to fullback,
the third line situation appears
j much brighter.
A star last year at goal guard,
! Webster returns this year to find
that Williams, varsity goalie of two
' years past, is also on the job. A
i situation of this kind is whai
j coaches dream about in their most
optimistic moments.
Johnston Freshman Star
An unknown quantity is a good
' description of the freshman team
! vv:.th but one exception—Johnston,
| a center forward of much promise.
Johnston has had a great deal of
• experience playing in South Amer
' ica and will be the key man about
! which the freshman team will be
; huilt.
I Great care has been taken by
; Maloney and Manager Singer in
i getting together a schedule which
will not conflict with any important
| football game and at the same time
i will prove interesting for the team.
The official schedule has not yet
been released by A1 Masters, but
j Maloney is quoted as naming iL "the
best schedule in years."

I and Larry Washburn.
Inside left will be well taken care
j of by Captain Falk who has been
i noted for his hard and fast play.
Hearn, who was the outstanding
frtar of last year's freshmen, is ex

J forward. Ineligible last year, Wasli-
I burn, a junior, and captain and star

the job again with the near cer
tainty of a position in the forward
line where he played as a freshman.
Plumb Only Veteran Half
At halfback, Preston Plumb is the
only veteran returning and can be
counted on to fill one position. How
ever, it is reported that Menlo has
contributed a flashing center half to
the Indian soccer fold, in which case
! the second line .. *ould be well taken
I care of.
It was thought that the fullback
j position would be especially weak
I from pre-season indications. How
i ever, with the return of Buster

Holmes, a capable back of a few
years past, and the shifting of Brek
elbaum from goal guard to fullback,
the third line situation appears
j much brighter.
A star last year at goal guard,
! Webster returns this year to find
that Williams, varsity goalie of two
' years past, is also on the job. A
i situation of this kind is whai
j coaches dream about in their most
optimistic moments.
Johnston Freshman Star
An unknown quantity is a good
' description of the freshman team
! vv:.th but one exception—Johnston,
| a center forward of much promise.
Johnston has had a great deal of
• experience playing in South Amer
' ica and will be the key man about
! which the freshman team will be
; huilt.
I Great care has been taken by
; Maloney and Manager Singer in
i getting together a schedule which
will not conflict with any important
| football game and at the same time
i will prove interesting for the team.
The official schedule has not yet
been released by A1 Masters, but
j Maloney is quoted as naming iL "the
best schedule in years."
Reported to have some 18,000 en
: rolled within the confines of its
: ; piked iron fence, California boasted
I this year of the largest turnout for
J soccer in the history of that sport
at Berkeley. Harry Maloney, Stan
ford's sporting soccer coach, was
' justly proud when he found that
| the Farm's soccer squad topped the
! one at Berkeley by 10 men.
Although losing nine regulars
i from last season, both Maloney and
Captain Falk have only the most
optimistic outlook on the prospects
' for this season. It was seen at the
first practice held on Friday that
there were a great number of can
didates for every position on the
varsity which points to spirited
competition and resulting enthu
; siasm.
Forward Line Strong
Not entirely devoid of veteran
i material, Maloney's varsity will start
I off with a strong trio of veterans in
