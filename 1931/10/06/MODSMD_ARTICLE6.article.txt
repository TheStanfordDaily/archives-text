# VOTE LOOMS IN BRITISH CRISIS
## Macdonald's Fiat Under Fire in Commons 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 5. (/P) —'The Brit
ish Cabinet unanimously decided to
night to issue an immediate call for
a general election. The fight will be
by the national government on the
platform of a manifesto to be issued
by Prime Minister Mac Donald.

LONDON, Oct. 5. (/P)—The politi
cal situation took a dramatic turn
tonight when twenty-two Liberal
members of Parliament, of whom
Sir John Simon was the leader,
pledged their unqualified support to
Prime Minister Ramsay Mac Donald.
"This meeting of Liberal mem
bers of Parliament," a resolution
passed by the group said, '"resolved
to form itself into a body to give
firm support to the Prime Minister
as head of the national government
and for purposes of fighting a gen
eral election."
Premier Fights Deadlock
During the last few days Mac-
Donald has been desperately striv
ing to overcome the deadlock caused
by conservative insistence on tariffs
as part of the election program and
Liberal opposition to such tariffs.
It was believed in political circles
tonight that, assured of this measure
of Liberal support in any eventu
ality, the Prime Minister now might
feel able to push ahead with confi
dence toward the general election.
Seeks Lloyd George Aid
Mac Donald today made a pil
grimage to Churt, a hamlet in the
Surrey hills, in a final attempt to
win David Lloyd George's full sup
port in the coming general election.
It is understood the Liberal leader
has decided to remain on the side
lines, offering no opposition to those
members of his party who are sup
porting Mac Donald's government.
Expectations are that the call for
the election will be issued within
forty-eight hours.
Considering the electtion to be in
evitable, 800 'Labor party delegates,
at their annual conference at Scar
borough today, began to build the
platform of their opposition pro
gram.
