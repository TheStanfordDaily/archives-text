# PEG CONVERSE OLD STANFORD STAR RETURNS
## Will Take Feminine Lead In First Play Of Quarter, "Berkeley Square" TWO HUNDRED TRY OUT Collins and De Wit Are Also Cast By Helvenston 
### 
Celebrating her return to the
campus with the feminine lead in
"Berkeley Square," the first play ot
the quarter, Peg Randall Conveise
was chosen last night to play Helen
Pettigrew.
â–  Helen is the wistful, sensitive girl
whose character strikingly contrasts
with that of her polished worldly
sister. This role should not prove
to be difficult for an actress with
the talents and versatility which Peg
Randall Converse has shown in her
previous characterizations on the
Stanford stage.
In Former Plays
Among the plays in which this
campus star will be best remem
bered are Dulcy in the play of that
name; Cinderella, in "A Kiss for
Cinderella"; Etta, in Philip Barry's
"You and I," and Ophelia in "Ham
let." This summer as Cynthia in
"The Beggar on Horseback" she
was awarded numerous favorable
commendations from dramatic
critics.
Harold Helvenston, dramatics di
rector, cast two of the other women
characters but as yet has not se
lected any of the men's parts. Bar
bara Collins, who has done remark
able bits in the one-act plays, the
"Mistress" and Shaw's "Augustus,"
is to play the Duchess of Devon
shire. The part of Marjorie Frant,
characterized as an attractive girl
in the late twenties, will be taken
by Jaqueline DeWit. As Lukitch's
wife in the "Inspector General" and
in "The Hairy Ape" she did excel
lent work.
Record in Tryouts
Setting a record for all play try
outs more than 200 competed for
parts in John L. Balderston's "Ber
keley Square." Helvenston ex
pressed himself as being well
pleased with the unusually large
number of good possibilities for fu
ture dramatic productions.
Any men interested in reading the
part of Tom Pettigrew are requested
to be at the Assembly Hall today at
1 o'clock when final tryouts will be
held. Peter Sta'ndish, the male lead
and character opposing Helen Petti
grew has not been cast as yet but
the remainder of the characters
will be chosen this week and next.
