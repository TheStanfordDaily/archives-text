## Final Selection Depends On Practical Work 
### 
The Daily is seeking new blood to
! carry on its traditions and is hold-
I ing a meeting tonight at 8 o'clock
! for those who wish to try out their
I journalistic abilities. More reporters
i are to be taken on this year than

j freshmen, sophomores, and juniors,
j new and old.
Tryoutees will undergo a period
! of office work, assignment in jour-
I nalism texts, tests on newspaper
j style, and actual newspaper report
i ing. During this time they will do
all kinds of work connected with the
| paper in order to become familiar
i with the Daily's routine. When the
j new staff members have finally been
! selected, they will be assigned defi-
I nite "beats" to cover each day.

j hours spent in the office being use-

j tryoutees. Previous experience is
i valuable, but the student's record
I while trying out will count for al
j most everything.
j Many fields of work arc open to
! the Daily reporter. Sports reporting,
features, reviewing of books, plays,
