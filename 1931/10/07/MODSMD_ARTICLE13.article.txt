# DOUBLE THREAT CHARACTERIZES GOPHER ATTACK
## Visitors Range from 150 to 216 Pounds; Outweigh Cards 7 Pounds 
### Jack Jernegan 
Big, bouncing behemoths and
fancy featherweights make up a
strangely contrasting Minnesota
football teaVn which will clash with
the Stanford gridmen Saturday. A
large part of the Gopher squad is
made up of the chunky giants who
are considered characteristic of the
Middle West, but some of the main
cogs in the machinery are scarcely
heavy enough to stay on the ground
when the wind is blowing.
Minnesota will outweigh Stanford
by seven pounds to the man in the
line, and yet Jim Dennerly, regular
right guard, tips the Fairbanks at
exactly 157 pounds. It doesn't take
a very brilliant mind to see what
kind of men must make up the rest
of the line in order to raise the
average.
Take the tackles, for instance.
You can't take them very far, how
ever, for Marshall Wells weighs in
at 206. and his running mate, Pat
Boland, is registered at 216 pounds.
And both of them stand six feet one.
Captain Clarence Munn, a great
punter, a great guard, and a very
capable runner and passer, reports
a poundage of 215, which, with his
height of only five feet ten inches,
makes quite a solid piece of football
player.
Roy Oen, one of the two compet
ing centers, weighs only 172, but
Lloyd Stein, who has a slight edge
at the position, is right in there with
i 95. At the ends Coach Fritz Cris
ler has Brad Robinson at 186 and
A1 Teeter, 194.
Most of these boys are six feet or
under as compared with such tall
Stanford men as Chuck Ehrhorn,
Don Colvin, George Grey, and Ernie
Caddel. This indicates that the visi
tors will present a rather square
appearance on the field Saturday
and may not look quite as large as
the slimmer Cardinals.
In the backfield big Jack Man
ders, heralded as a line crasher par
excellence and weighing 200 pounds,
shares the spotlight with Kenneth
"Peewee" MacDougall, who registers
150 pounds soaking wet and holds
down the quarterback post. The
halfbacks are both light, My Übl
weighing 175 and Walt Hass listed
at 167.
With this lineup Minnesota pre
sents a double threat in addition to
the "bludgeon of the defense" which
frustrated Indian hopes last year.
Hitting behind the big boys in the
front wall, Manders ought to make
Stanford feel his might in a straight
power attack.
On the other hand, reports from
Minneapolis indicate that it was a
fast aerial offensive that brought
about the downfall of the Oklahoma
Aggies last Saturday.
In the Indian camp yesterday
Coach Pop Warner continued the
process of testing which is gradually
producing a first team. However, he
did not bring together the various
elements expected to make up that
combination.
A backfield composed of Lacombe,
Caddel, Anderson, and Rintala
worked behind a second string line
in scrimmage, the chief purpose ap
parently being to accustom Rintala
and Caddel to their new positions
at fullback and right half respec
tively.

parently being to accustom Rintala
and Caddel to their new positions
at fullback and right half respec
tively.
Big, bouncing behemoths and
fancy featherweights make up a
strangely contrasting Minnesota
football teaVn which will clash with
the Stanford gridmen Saturday. A
large part of the Gopher squad is
made up of the chunky giants who
are considered characteristic of the
Middle West, but some of the main
cogs in the machinery are scarcely
heavy enough to stay on the ground
when the wind is blowing.
Minnesota will outweigh Stanford
by seven pounds to the man in the
line, and yet Jim Dennerly, regular
right guard, tips the Fairbanks at
exactly 157 pounds. It doesn't take
a very brilliant mind to see what
kind of men must make up the rest
of the line in order to raise the
average.
Take the tackles, for instance.
You can't take them very far, how
ever, for Marshall Wells weighs in
at 206. and his running mate, Pat
Boland, is registered at 216 pounds.
And both of them stand six feet one.
Captain Clarence Munn, a great
punter, a great guard, and a very
capable runner and passer, reports
a poundage of 215, which, with his
height of only five feet ten inches,
makes quite a solid piece of football
player.
Roy Oen, one of the two compet
ing centers, weighs only 172, but
Lloyd Stein, who has a slight edge
at the position, is right in there with
i 95. At the ends Coach Fritz Cris
ler has Brad Robinson at 186 and
A1 Teeter, 194.
Most of these boys are six feet or
under as compared with such tall
Stanford men as Chuck Ehrhorn,
Don Colvin, George Grey, and Ernie
Caddel. This indicates that the visi
tors will present a rather square
appearance on the field Saturday
and may not look quite as large as
the slimmer Cardinals.
In the backfield big Jack Man
ders, heralded as a line crasher par
excellence and weighing 200 pounds,
shares the spotlight with Kenneth
"Peewee" MacDougall, who registers
150 pounds soaking wet and holds
down the quarterback post. The
halfbacks are both light, My Übl
weighing 175 and Walt Hass listed
at 167.
With this lineup Minnesota pre
sents a double threat in addition to
the "bludgeon of the defense" which
frustrated Indian hopes last year.
Hitting behind the big boys in the
front wall, Manders ought to make
Stanford feel his might in a straight
power attack.
On the other hand, reports from
Minneapolis indicate that it was a
fast aerial offensive that brought
about the downfall of the Oklahoma
Aggies last Saturday.
In the Indian camp yesterday
Coach Pop Warner continued the
process of testing which is gradually
producing a first team. However, he
did not bring together the various
elements expected to make up that
combination.
A backfield composed of Lacombe,
Caddel, Anderson, and Rintala
worked behind a second string line
in scrimmage, the chief purpose ap
parently being to accustom Rintala
and Caddel to their new positions
at fullback and right half respec
tively.
