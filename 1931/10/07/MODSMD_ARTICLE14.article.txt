# BOOTBLACK, FIXTURE ON FARM, DIES
## "Pop" Harris Passes On After Long Illness; Born As Slave 
### 
A negro slave was freed last night.
Seman "Pop" Harris, beloved
bootblack and friend to generations
of Stanford students, died yesterday
at the county hospital. The long ill
ness, which had kept him from his
accustomed place, yesterday marked
the finale to another Stanford tradi
tion.
His little shop, a familiar part of
the old Toonerville regime, when
the car used his front stoop for a
terminal, "Pop's" shoe shining ser
vices have been distributed no more
generously than his friendship.
Born a slave, his stories of his
boyhood on a Southern plantation,
and the earlier days at Stanford,
furnished provender to campus
journalists for years. "Pop"' Harris
was here when Herbert Hoover was
a student, and was pleased to add
an extra polish to the presidential
shoes when Hoover returned on a
visit to his campus home.
One of "Pop's" customs, which he
propounded to students of finance
and banking, was to cache his life's
earnings in an iron kettle, secreted
somewhere in his Palo Alto back
yard.
Just how old "Pop" Harris was,
nobody knows. But he held a pic
turesque nook in Stanford life, and
students mourn his departure.
