# STOCKS ROCKET AS MART RIOTS
## Prices Climb To Highest Levels Since 1929

I NEW YORK, Oct. 6. (7P) â€” The
j stocks that nobody wanted yester
! day had plenty of friends today.
Between Monday's close and to
i day's opening there popped up one
j of those amazingly rapid changes in
[ market psychology and quotations
! swooped dizzily upward in the
largest general advance since No
vember 14, 1929. Based on the
Standard Statistics-Associated Press
I averages the gain amounted to 8.7
j points, much larger than any of the
I June rallies. Sales totaled 4,301.464
J shares.
President Hoover's plans to effect
I "National unity in the setting-up
|of constructive forces in place of
destructive forces now working in
i the depression" were veiled in con
! siderable secrecy while the market
I was in session, but Wall Street took
; the White House announcement to
i mean that definite measures were
| being worked out to ease frozen
| credits and restore confidence,
! doubtless through the co-operation
I of bankers and the national govern
ment.
i However much the Street was in
j the dark concerning what has been
i or is to be accomplished, there was
no mistaking the effect of the
Washington advices on the security
j and commodity markets. Bonds
could not do as well as stocks, but
many issues were in good demand.
Cotton advanced $1.55 to $1,755 a
| bale.
Strongly encouraged by the over
i night announcement of President
j Hoover's meeting with the Congres
sional leaders this evening, shares
got further support from another
j stock exchange edict on sales.
