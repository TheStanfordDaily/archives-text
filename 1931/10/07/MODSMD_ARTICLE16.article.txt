Opening practice, the quarterback j
j pulled a scoring punch out of his I
j bag of tricks: a Stillson with a 10- j
| inch handle and reciprocal beveling.
; Ho caught the opposition napping, !
! and was successful in most cases al-
I though he missed twice and broke
j three beds.
The ball was buried under a mass
of players, and at present the shaft i
has been sunk to a depth of 850
feet with traces of hair oil but a
preponderance of bacon rind. Com

"Pliancy Phil" Humphreys re
versed his field completely on a

clothes inside out, but had a hard
time with his shoes when his arches
fell through and started going in the
