# GOOD MATERIAL FOR FALL PREDICTED BY BIG TRACK TURNOUT
## 
### 
Fall track practice was given an
exceptionally good start this week
with the registration of 98 men, 18
of whom are freshmen.
Among the large number of pros
pects to report to Dink Templeton
for the preliminary training are two
new sensational milers, Ferri, a
transfer from Glendale Junior Col
lege, who defeated Cliff Halstead
in the mile at the National A.A.U.
meet last summer, and Stallings,
Utah transfer, reputed to have
traveled the distance in 1:28.
Fall track practice will consist of
light daily workouts. Practice meets
will be held each Friday, the first
of which will probably be run off
next week.
