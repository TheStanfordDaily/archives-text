# Soph 'Raid' Flops; Battle Of Taunts, Curses, Ends Even
## Passive Resistance of Frosh Baffles Second Year Men; 200 Gambol on Encina Lawn as Sponsors Cluck Warningly Over Yearling Flock UPPERCLASSMEN OUTNUMBER SOPH RAIDERS Damage Negligible but Language Is Fierce on Both Sides; Soph Cussers Hold Big Edge 
### 
As a light, the soph raid on Encina last night was a good debate. Both
sides showed remarkable will-power. The sophs, reinforced by upper
classmen until they were 200 strong on the Encina lawn, by dint of threat
self-control held themselves back from hurling themselves on the frosh,
who stood on the steps and showed the same remarkable restraint in
attacking. Activities remained at that point for some time, both classes
showing remarkable ability which may eventually get them into the

- debate squad, but never into tlie
■ American Legion.
| Sophs began to collect behind
I Toyon Hall after phone calls to all
j the fraternities, and room-to-room
j ballyhooo in the halls. The members
j of the first contingent shivered on
! the windy plain and were on the
i point of returning to their beds
j when loaded cars from the Row be
l gan to arrive. Half an hour's pre
! liminary wrangling gave the frosh
j time to wake up and prepare.
The rotten tomatoes and water
j bags were replaced by vituperation
1 which showed that the lower class
j men spent a good deal of the time
; during the summer in reading books
| of medicine. The wise cracks hurled
! from lawn to windows and vice
j versa showed they also hung around
dentists' waiting rooms.
The sponsors were armed with
paper and pencils and took heavy
toll of daring frosh who advanced
! down the steps 1o a point a little
I nearer shouting distance.
The only gainer is the varsity for
| ensic squad. Some excellent plat
j form wind-slingers may be discov
j ered as a result of last night's fiasco.
