# Woman Harpist Offers Pleasing Chapel Concert
## Artist Assisted in Concert By Warren Allen 
### 
Playing to an unusually large au- j
dience in the Chapel, Annie Louise j
David, harpist, and Warren D Al- j
len, University organist, gave one of |
the most beautiful music I'ecitals
whiqh has been heard on the campus
for some time.
Miss David proved to be a harpist
of exceptional ability. Her touch
was sure and light, and her playing j
was very pleasant to hear. Warren !
D. Allen very ably assisted her. I
There were four outstanding num- ,
bers on the program. Concerto in C j
Major by Mozart was the most j
pleasing in many respects. The com- j
position had a finish and perfection j
which was not quite equaled by any j
of the other numbers, and had a j
charming lilting quality which ap- j
pealed very much. It was exquisite- j
ly played.
Siciliano by Bach was a great suc
cess. With its slow and rather som
ber tempo it was in distinct con
trast with the ordinary type of Si
ciliana commonly heard.
Walther's "Prize Song" from "Die
Meistersinger" by Wagner was
grand. As is usual with a number
of Wagner's compositions, one is j
very pleasantly surprised at the j
originality and the lack of shackling !
traditions so common in the operas j
of that period.
