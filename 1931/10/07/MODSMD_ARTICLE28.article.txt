# THIS "DUTCH" DATE IDEA
## 
### 
From the University of Arizona conies news of the for
mation by men students of a "Bachelors' (Jul)," members
of which will endeavor to make the Arizona co-eds pay
half the cost of all dates until the depression is over.
Similar movements at other colleges in the past have
been regarded as mere outbursts of collegianism by pub
licity-seeking Wisenheimers. Today, the Arizona plan ap
peal's in the light of a real solution for a problem bred of
these troublous times.
Backers of the suggestion hold that at Arizona, at least,
the average girl has more money than the average male,
and that it is only fair for her to bear half the expenses of
dates. Dating has dwindled alarmingly, the Bachelors de
clare, so that one date a week has become a positive lux
ury for men to whom it was a more trequent regular oc
currence a year ago.
With its unequal proportion of men and women, Stan
ford University has perhaps not experienced a dating
drought such as has descended upon institutions where the
number of co-eds more nearly approximates the number
of men. Nevertheless, women on this campus are already
remarking that fewer men are dating this year, and those
comparatively infrequently. There is no denying it.
The Daily certainly does not advocate any mass action
on the part of the students, such as Arizona is undertaking,
but it cannot fail to recognize the seriousness of the situ
ation. However, it is perfectly possible for the puzzle to be
worked out between individuals, and in the light of pres
cut conditions, some such agreement must eventually be
reached if the art of dating is to survive on the Stanford
campus.
