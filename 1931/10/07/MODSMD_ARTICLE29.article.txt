# WE THOUGHT THIS A DEAD ISSUE

"Northwestern University's campus bubbled with ex
citement today as the sorority girls failed to come to any
agreement with faculty representatives over smoking in
sorority houses." So says a news dispatch.
One thing is certain; the girls will smoke and nothing
can stop them. It' the ban is placed on sorority houses, then
smoking'will be done on the streets or in drug stores fol
lowing the daily "coke."
,11 is a question of which is the more objectionable to
the university authorities: to have the girls smoking in the
privacy of a smoking room set aside for that purpose, or
to have them smoking in public.
In these days of equality which is the boast of femi
ninity, there is no "moral" suasion against smoking by
women. II becomes a "problem' only when it is made a
problem.
The Stanford campus once writhed in the throes of a
similar regulatory warfare and complete peace was estab
lished when smoking by women was shorn of the dignity
of an issue.
