A record that recalls the days when John Olsen was the
"Campus Cop" was luing up during the past year to fur
nish a mark for the student body as a whole to shoot at in
the year just begun.
Under the able and friendly guidance of one Cordon

mum of disturbance in the form of accidents.
Representatives of the state division of motor vehicles,
following a report on traffic conditions and control on the
campus, were lavish in their praise of the excellence of
the showing made here.
Officer Davis is almost parsimonious with his distribu
tion of "tickets," and it is only the occasional flagrant vio
lation that brings a citation. Me modestly disclaims any
credit for the safe and expeditious movement of traffic, but
the friendly respect that he commands from every student
who drives a car is a factor of immeasurable importance.
