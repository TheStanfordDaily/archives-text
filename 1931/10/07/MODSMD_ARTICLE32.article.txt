# BULL SESSION
## D. W. M.—EX-PARTNER OF MORGAN AND GRANFATHER OF AN EAGLET 
### 
I The country in general and the |
Republican party in particular are j
I the worse for the death of Dwight
I W. Morrow —Senator from New Jer- j
sey. His death was so sudden and i
untimely that editors and speakers |
did not have time to weave lengthy !
and exaggerated tributes. He left i
the political arena, as he enterd it, !
with surprising suddenness. His ;
| significance, however, is surely
worth noting.
Had he lived, Morrow would
probably have been an outstanding ;
contender for the Republican nomi
nation in 1936; and if nominated, he i
would have made a serious bid for
victory. After his sweeping victory
J in his native state, he was men- j
, tioned for 1932; but Morrow quickly ;
indicated his support of Hoover. .
That Morrow would have been a !
great aide in carrying the wet East I
for Hoover is beyond doubt. The '
1 senator was that singular thing in I
national politics—a frank and !
avowed wet. He minced no words j
j with talk of investigation and study. |
1 He had a conviction and he voiced j
it. He had the status in the com- I
munity that permitted him to be a :
wet (or a "liberal" as Mr. Hearst
prefers to call those enemies of pro- j
| hibition). Just as Charles Evans j
j Hughes was able to hold much of !
the Eastern wet sentiment 1o Hoover ;
in 1928, so would have Morrow been
able to perform in 1932. If the
Democrats nominate a wet in '32, j
Morrow's loss will be keenly felt.
To the nation—exclusive of Re
i publicans—he is also a loss. Morrow 1

| was a gentleman and a financier in
! politics—a rare creature in the mud
and muddle of public life. He had
i been a partner in the House of
Morgan; and despite that political
: handicap in a democracy, he swept
I New Jersey with a majority that
' made his opponents look positively
I foolish. His work in Mexico—his
| frankness—and his progressive at
| titude gave. him victory.
That a henchman—even an ex
| henchman—of Morgan could be
elected to the U.S. Senate shows a
i marked change in the times. Ever
1 since Jackson swept democracy i
| the White House, there has been a
fear and dread of big business men.
This fear—fanned by demagogues
I like the present Senator Brookhart.
| of lowa—kept much ability out of
I American public life.
Whether an entire nation—made
' up largely of lowa-minded territory
! —would follow in the steps of an
j Eastern state which is wet above
i everything else is a question to
| make many ponder. Perhaps, how
i ever, the fact that a large bank
j account did not stop Morrow may
1 induce many more public-spirited
| men of the same type to enter poli
| tics.
The fiction that all big business
| men are bad and all "men of the
' people" are wonderful must be dis
; pelled if the best talent in America
j is to find its v/ay into government.
However, the election of a Morrow
j er a Couzens should not lead to the
custom of making wealth a prere
| quisite of office holding.
—Abe Mellinkoff.
