EAST IS ALWAYS EAST — By
Pamela Wynne. Garden City,
N.Y. Doubleday, Doran & Com
pany. 1931.
Miss Wynne has been called the
English Kathleen Norris. A simi
larity between the two women is
! noticeable in "East Is Always East.''
j The good are rewarded and the
: naughty punished.
There are four separate themes in
I this story of the pretty widow who
I takes her two daughters to India
! for a winter. One, two, and three
! are the respective love affairs of
the mother and her daughters.
Theme four is the question of the
mixture of the English with the
Hindu race. "East Is Always Enst"
I is given a double meaning by Miss
i Wynne. Eastern race customs are
| essentially different from Western
i ones and so the attachment of the
j Indian prince for the flirtatious
daughter results in misunderstand
; ing ar.d ill feeling. Secondly, the
East that is an Anglo-Indian mili
tary settlement always provided
i husbands for visiting English girls.
"East Is Always East" has more
| "punch" than is to be found in Mrs.
Norris' novels. The flirtatious
daughter is kidnapped by the Hindu
I and so considerable suspense is de
' velopcd before she is rescued. How
\ ever, these novels of "clouds that
' always clear" are inevitably weak.
' No book is to be enjoyed that fol
j lows a formula so nicely that you
; can time the reformation of erring
: characters. —E. T. P.

D. A. Appleton & Company. 1'J.31.
"Midnight has went talkie," as
Opus Randall, the comedian, said to j
Sis Callie Flukers. The colored |
moving picture concern, Midnights j
Pictures, Inc., has begun a new
series of adventures with the inno
vation of "talkie" apparatus. Those
who know the previous history of
the company know how amusing 1
Mi\ Cohen can be. "Lillies of the j
Alley" is better and funnier.
The first of the short stories finds j
Opus speaking into tomato-cans
suspended from the ceiling. He tells j
Sis Callie that he is getting ready
to play into the mike.
The best of the lot is the story
of the breach of promise suits be- j

! tween Tvlagnolius Ricketts and Coral
| Hench. Miss Hench pulls a smooth
! line with Magnolius in order to re
gain the estranged affections of her
former husband, Magnolius' valet,
who has fallen heir to $5,000. The
colored siren's campaign consists of
suing both the men for breach of
promise.
Those who like Cohen's stuff and
those who don't care for his other
I things will all get plenty of laughs
out of "Lillies of the Alley."

Pirandello. E. P. Dutton. 1931. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
A person is not himself but what
, he is to all other people, suggested
Signor Pirandello rather impolitely j
in "Right You are if You Think
You Are."
Usually when a playwright gen- J
erally recognized as provocative
twangs a solitary string of his muse's '
harp continually, his readers and .
even Ihe critics will finally rebuke I
him roundly.
Pirandello, however, has the
unique ability of being able to re
peat a thesis indefinitely without
receiving brickbats and several
days-deceased cats on his doorstep.
"As You Desire Me" uses the
i same identity theme differently.
: The Strange Lady, tired of sensu- !
I ality, leaves her cabarets to assume j
! the identity of another woman and, 1
having convinced even the skeptics j
that she is no impostor, goes back j
to her dancing.
The play is unsual, interesting, '

i though not equal to "The Man With

EAST IS ALWAYS EAST — By
Pamela Wynne. Garden City,

pany. 1931.
Miss Wynne has been called the
English Kathleen Norris. A simi
larity between the two women is
! noticeable in "East Is Always East.''
j The good are rewarded and the
: naughty punished.
There are four separate themes in
I this story of the pretty widow who
I takes her two daughters to India
! for a winter. One, two, and three
! are the respective love affairs of
the mother and her daughters.
Theme four is the question of the
mixture of the English with the
Hindu race. "East Is Always Enst"
I is given a double meaning by Miss
i Wynne. Eastern race customs are
| essentially different from Western
i ones and so the attachment of the
j Indian prince for the flirtatious
daughter results in misunderstand
; ing ar.d ill feeling. Secondly, the
East that is an Anglo-Indian mili
tary settlement always provided
i husbands for visiting English girls.
"East Is Always East" has more
| "punch" than is to be found in Mrs.
Norris' novels. The flirtatious
daughter is kidnapped by the Hindu
I and so considerable suspense is de
' velopcd before she is rescued. How
\ ever, these novels of "clouds that
' always clear" are inevitably weak.
' No book is to be enjoyed that fol
j lows a formula so nicely that you
