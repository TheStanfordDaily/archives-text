Something has got to be done j
about the dating depression, obvi- !
ously, or a lot of young Roblean*' |
dreams about college week-ends |
are going to smash. Ye noble editor i
opens the question for discussion i
in his column this morning. Maybe
a step in tke dutch-treat direction
would herald the real, honest-to
heaven no-hokum return of the
Stanford rough. You've heard of >
him, the ever-ready hero, whose ;
every word and glance was re
spected, and who was rated on mus
cular strength rather than dancing ■
agility.
There was a young fellow named
Skinnah
Took a girl to the city for din
nah—
Though he learned quite a lot
That he never forgot
Yet his pocketbook's very much j
thinnah ....
There are two sides to the ques- j
tion. Pity the poor fresh from the j
country, to whom dinner at home j
means soup, hash, and a slab of I
apple pie. Also the traditional fresh
man woman with a blue Packard, j
There are those who ....
Every professor is greeted annu- ,
ally with reams of material that j
might put "Strange As It Seems" !
io shame. Consider a worthy ox- |
ponent of the Art of Composition,
who asked a Certain Attractive Coed 1
to identify a phrase piously inserted J
in a short story—
. . . Thy will be done. Miss
Xrpqv. From what is that
taken?" "Why—er—l've heard it
somewhere. Oh—l know—it's
from that new Cather novel I
read last week!"
The weekly meetings of allied j
sorority representatives have started |
again with a bang, and since Wind- !
jammer hopes, among other things, \
to be a highly educational institu- I
tion in Stanford life, we're starting [
a series of articles supplementing
the Frosh Bible:
Panhellenic, dear children, is
a group organized for the bene
fit of campus women who are
tired of doing things. Each year I

two worn-out members of each
sorority are chosen to go and sit
in the clubhouse for half an
j hour, once a week, to agree that
I there is no business to be taken
up, and vote for adjournment,
t
; Why, or why, can't something be
j done about it, like systematically
I bombing the University Woman's
! mind, or establishing a relief so
: ciety for the prevention of cruelty
! to Ford fenders?
