â– DINK" AND FOOTBALL
Sometimes we suspect that "Dink"
Templeton would like to discontinue
football at Stanford. It interferes so
with track. Take, for instance, the
case of Dave Packard. Right now
Packard is working for ''Pop'' War
ner, and then John Bunn wants him
for basketball.
"We ought to have a pretty
fair team this year," Dink re
plied to our queries last night,
"but we need hurdlers. Pack
ard might be a good man, but
he ought to be out here now."
Last year it was weight men the
venerable boy coach lacked during
full practice. Some seven of them,
including Laborde, Nellie Gray,
George Grey, and McLeod, were
out for football, leaving the weight
pits singularly deserted.
About this hurdle proposition: the
loss of Podge Smith and Al Nisbet
will of course be keenly felt, but
with Bruggman and Herbert left
from the varsity and Packard grad
uated from the frosh team, the situ
ation may net be so bad by the
time spring rolls around. Even if
Packard doesn't report to Templeton
until the close of the hoop season,
lie will at least be in good physical
condition.
Will Rogers, Jr., is no less
versatile than his famous dad.
A crack polo player, a good
swimmer, and an experienced
journalist, bis services are much
in demand on the campus.

Rogers lias already turned out
for swimming, the backstroke
I being his specialty, but told the
writer yesterday that he is us
yet undecided about polo. lie
plays either No. 1 or No. 2 posi
tion, as does his father, and
would be a valuable addition to
Captain Gordan's quartet this
i year.
