! Speaking of versatility, consider
| the case of Clarence Munn, huge
i captain of the invading Minnesota
: Gophers. He is listed as a guard,
j but is just as much at home in ihe
I backfieki.
He does the punting for the
team, but his presence at full
back does not necessarily mean
j a kick, as Munn can also pass
and run. During his career at
Minnesota, Munn has played
fullback, tackle, halfback, and
! finally guard. It was at the lat
ter post that he earned all-con
ference honors last year.
Munn may give another exhibition
j of kicking such as Paglia of the
! Broncos did last week, when the
! Gophers and Indians meet Saturday.
I Last season his punts averaged bet
| ter than 40 yards each, despite two
j which were blocked. This year he
I is reported even better.

I Munn is also a track man, the
j shot being his specialty. He won the
! event at the Penn Relays last sea
! son, and also took the Big Ten title,
i —L. M. C.
