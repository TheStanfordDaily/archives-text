# "Card Swimmers of the Best"-Brandsten
## BOOTH UNO CLAPP HEAD GALAXY OF RETURNING STARS Freshman Prospects Look Good, States Veteran Stanford Coach 
### Richard Van Wagenen 
"Absolutely one of the outstanding i
teams in the United States today, i
That is how Coach Ernst Brand- j
sten characterized the present Stan- j
ford varsity swimming outfit yes- |
terday. lie believes it to be a I
par with anything either Michigan j
or Rutgers can offer, and that is j
saying a good deal.
Not only that, but the present
collection of water-dogs is, in Coach ;
Brandsten's experience, and that is j
some 1(3 years at Stanford, the best
he has ever seen here. This is based
partly on the fact that four Car
dinals participated in the national
championships in Honolulu last
summer, and two invaded Japan
with an American team.
Practically the entire varsity team
is back in the water this season, in
cluding Captain Frank Booth, Aus
tin Clapp, Ted Wiget, last year's
freshman star, John McKelvey,
Ward Woods, Fred Tibbets, Gordon
Graves, .Paul de Silva, John Gard
| ner, Larry Harris, Burke Knapp.
| McClelland Linton, and John Trot
ter.
As for the incoming freshmen,
they are just about as promising as
Coach Brandsten could want. In the
fiist place, Jimmy Triola is added to
the list of Stanford swim stars,
j Triola holds the N.C.S. record for
I 220 yards. Then there is Bill Rogers,
! son of the famous humorist, who
j specializes in backstroke, and Chuck
Booth, sprinter from LA. High.
George Fry, in' the 220-yard event,
and Vlad Taranik of Galileo High,
hold plenty of promise.
For diving, the Class of '35 claims
.George Fuller, holder of the north
ern California private school cham
pionship. and Milton Friedman from
Galileo High. With all this, swim
ming fans should have good reason
to expect a very fancy showing
from the water this season.
