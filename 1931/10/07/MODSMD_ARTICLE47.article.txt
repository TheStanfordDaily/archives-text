# ONLY THREE CARDINALS REACH FIRST AS EARNSHAW SILENCES ST. LOUIS GUNS, 3-0
## BY ALLAN J. GOULD Sports Editor 
### 
SHIBE PARK, PHILADELPHIA,
Oct (J. (/P) —The big guns boomed
again today. Big George Earnshaw
cracked the whip lash of his fast
| ball. The Athletics won the fourth
I of the world series games, 3 to 0,
and it's a deadlock, at two games
each, in one of the most spectacular
battles of all time for the baseball
championship.
Earnshaw held the Cardinals to a
pair of hits, both made by the irre
pressible "Pepper" Martin, sensa
tional rookie outfielder, and was in
vincible with a fireball that had
j most of the other Red birds in a
J daze.
No Cards Reach Third
It was Martin who almost single
handed "stole" the second game of
the series from Earnshaw with his ,
spectacular base running, but the I
big right hander permitted no Car - !
dinal foot to reach third base this |
afternoon as he bore down with !
blinding speed on the three occa
sions he was threatened.
Meanwhile, the big sluggers of !
the "A's" emerged from their two
day coma to knock Sylvester John- j
son out of the box in the sixth |
inning with an attack featured by I
Jimmy Foxx's terrific home run j
over the left field stands.
The world champions collected
ten hits off the combined offerings ;
of Johnson and Jim Lindsey, twice
as many as they gained off Halla- |
han and Grimes in two previous i
contests.
War to Continue in S(. Louis
They looked every inch the part
of world champions in squaring the j
series, thereby making it certain I
that the warring forces will return i
to St. Louis to decide the issue after
playing the fifth game here tomor
row.
There was no Presidential atmos- !

! phere to add excitement to today's
| game, but another capacity crowd
i of 32,295 fans yelled itself hoarse as
i Earnshaw twirled the second two
; hit game of the series. It was more
' effective, though perhaps not quite
! so thrilling and dramatic as Bur
' leigh Grimes' two-hit victory of the
day before which was marred by A1
Simmons' ninth inning home run.
Coming on top of Bill Ilallahan's
j three-hit shutout and Grimes'great
j performance, however, Earnshaw's
feat added to one of the greatest
' exhibitions of pitching in world
! series history. It was a masterpiece
lof fast ball effectiveness, control,
j and confidence, comparable to the
brilliant work the big ex-collegian
i exhibited against the Cardinals a
j year ago.
Pitching Rivals '(Mi Scries
It's necessary to go back exactly
! twenty-five years to the 1906 series
! between the White Sox and Cubs, 1
; to find a parallel to the remarkable !
succession of twirling performances '
|in this intersectional battle. That
year, two famous right handers, Ed
1 Walsh of the Sox and Mordecai

j Cubs pitched two-hit games on suc
j cessive days.

SHIBE PARK, PHILADELPHIA,
Oct (J. (/P) —The big guns boomed
again today. Big George Earnshaw
cracked the whip lash of his fast
| ball. The Athletics won the fourth
I of the world series games, 3 to 0,
and it's a deadlock, at two games
each, in one of the most spectacular
battles of all time for the baseball
championship.
Earnshaw held the Cardinals to a
pair of hits, both made by the irre
pressible "Pepper" Martin, sensa
tional rookie outfielder, and was in
vincible with a fireball that had
j most of the other Red birds in a
J daze.
No Cards Reach Third
It was Martin who almost single
handed "stole" the second game of
the series from Earnshaw with his ,
spectacular base running, but the I
big right hander permitted no Car - !
dinal foot to reach third base this |
afternoon as he bore down with !
blinding speed on the three occa
sions he was threatened.
Meanwhile, the big sluggers of !
the "A's" emerged from their two
day coma to knock Sylvester John- j
son out of the box in the sixth |
inning with an attack featured by I
Jimmy Foxx's terrific home run j
over the left field stands.
The world champions collected
ten hits off the combined offerings ;
of Johnson and Jim Lindsey, twice
as many as they gained off Halla- |
han and Grimes in two previous i
contests.
War to Continue in S(. Louis
They looked every inch the part
of world champions in squaring the j
series, thereby making it certain I
that the warring forces will return i
to St. Louis to decide the issue after
playing the fifth game here tomor
row.
There was no Presidential atmos- !

! phere to add excitement to today's
| game, but another capacity crowd
i of 32,295 fans yelled itself hoarse as
i Earnshaw twirled the second two
; hit game of the series. It was more
' effective, though perhaps not quite
! so thrilling and dramatic as Bur
' leigh Grimes' two-hit victory of the
day before which was marred by A1
Simmons' ninth inning home run.
Coming on top of Bill Ilallahan's
j three-hit shutout and Grimes'great
j performance, however, Earnshaw's
feat added to one of the greatest
' exhibitions of pitching in world
! series history. It was a masterpiece
lof fast ball effectiveness, control,
j and confidence, comparable to the
brilliant work the big ex-collegian
i exhibited against the Cardinals a
j year ago.
Pitching Rivals '(Mi Scries
It's necessary to go back exactly
! twenty-five years to the 1906 series
! between the White Sox and Cubs, 1
; to find a parallel to the remarkable !
succession of twirling performances '

year, two famous right handers, Ed
1 Walsh of the Sox and Mordecai
