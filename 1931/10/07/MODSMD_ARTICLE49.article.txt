# Golf Tryouts Open Monday
## Twenty To Remain After Thirty-Six Holes 
### 
Tryouts for the varsity golf team
will be held on the Stanford Uni
versity course next Monday, W. B.
Ellington, director of golf classes
;,nd teams, announced yesterday.
Play will be over 3G holes and
the first 20 players having- low
medal scores will be carried on the
ladder.
Organization of a team will follow
the appointment within a day or
two of a new golf manager, since
last year's manager failed to return
to the campus this season.
Prospects are bright for a very
strong team this season, Ellington
said. Captain Eichelberger has re
turned to the campus, as have Hell
man, Trautman, and Goldwater.
Charles Seaver and Lawson Little,
members of the freshman team last
year, who played in the national
amateur tournament this year, also
will be welcome material for the
varsity lineup.
Charles Ransom of Modesto, who
played in the Pebble Beach tourney
recently, also may turn out for the
Stanford golf squad.
An eight-man team will be se
lected.
Only eight men have signed up
for the freshman team. Others are
needed and all golf aspirants are
urged by Ellington to try out.

For more than 50 years a section
line near Fort Scott, in the prohibi
tion state of Kansas, has been
marked by a whisky bottle.
