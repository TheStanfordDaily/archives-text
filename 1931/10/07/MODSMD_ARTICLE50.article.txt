# Strong Uclan Freshman Eleven To Face Babes
## 
### 
If his freshman gridmen can sue- I
cessfully hurdle the obstacle pre- ,
sented by the U.C.L.A. yearlings in j
their meeting this coming Saturday, j
Coach Jimmy Braeishaw figures that
the Stanford team can complete a ;
satisfactory season. At present the
nemesis of the Cards appears to be ,
a great California Cub crew, and
the Indian babes' hope of victory in j
their final game of the year are
mighty forlorn.
The Uclans will bring a team here I
Saturday that is conspicuous for its t
weight and experience. The line will ;
easily average nearly 195 pounds,
with Muller at right tackle as the j
outstanding bruiser. His weight has j
been reported as high as 276 pounds, |
with considerable variation in the!
amount. Conservative estimates, !
however, place the figure at 248. J
At any rate, he will offer a bulky j
problem to Messrs. Seaver, Moore, i
Flannagan, Bowles, et al.
Injury, thai bugaboo of all teams, |
is already shoving its unwanted
personage into the scheme of things
on the freshman field. Four men are
out this week, with the possibility j
of their playing Saturday extremely :
doubtful. Bowles, Rothert, Semmel- j
roth, and Durkee are all suffering |

from minor injuries.
The subject of reserves is a ten
der one for Coach Bradshaw. Good
second- and third-string men are
conspicuous by their absence, and
Bradshaw is anxious to keep his
first team intact. It will bo necessary
, to refrain from playing men whose
condition is even slightly doubtful,
Manpower must be conserved for
the final and most important games
| on the schedule. Southern Califor-
I nia and California fail under this
i heading. It will be necessary t<>
; risk the possible loss of other names
iin order to be at peak for these
| critical contests.
