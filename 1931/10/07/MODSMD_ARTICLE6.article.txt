# EDISON'S DEATH IS FEARED SOON
## "Wizard of Menlo Park" Is Semi-Conscious 
### 
WEST ORANGE, N.J., Oct. 6. (/P)
â€”Death is only a few days away
for Thomas A. Edison, his personal
physician said today.
A bulletin by Dr. Hubert S. Howe
described the mental condition of
the "wizard of Menlo Park' as
"lethargic," and said he had lapsed
into semi-consciousness.
Dr. Howe's statement was a defi
nite blow to the lingering hope that
Edison's life might be prolonged.
Only last night the physician's bul
letins were of a more optimistic
tenor.
