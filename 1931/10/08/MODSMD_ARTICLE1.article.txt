# BRITISH CRISIS RESULT HINGES ON HUGE VOTE
## MacDonald Government's Control In Balance As Foes Rally LABOR MAY TRIUMPH Opening Guns Fired In Bitter Struggle 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 7 (/P).—The sixth
Parliament of the reign of King
George V was dissolved today and
Britain swung into an intensive
three weeks' campaign for a gen
eral election that will be historic.
Ramsay Mac Donald's National
Government will be returned to
power or wrecked on the broken
ranks of Conservatives and Liberals
over which Labor again may march
to victory.
The Prime Minister foreshadowed
negotiations for international agree
ments "which will remove some of
the most fruitful causes of the eco
nomic misfortunes — such as war
debts and reparations—from which
the whole world is now suffering."
He pleaded for national unity in
the nation's period of "recovery and
readjustment."
In these changing times, he said,
no one can make specific pledges,
and therefore "the Government must
bo free to consider every proposal
likely to help, such as tariffs, ex
pansion of exports and contraction
of imports, commercial treaties and
mutual economic arrangements with
the dominions."
Pleads over Radio
Mac Donald followed up his mani
festo with a radio appeal to the na
tion in which he attempted to make
evident to the humblest wage earner
the significance of the nation's finan
cial crisis.
He warned British housewives
that unless the country's finances
were properly safeguarded they
might discover, when they do their
marketing, that their shillings are
worth nine pence instead of twelve.
This speech was the opening gun
of a battle to the finish involving the
Labor, Conservative, and Liberal
parties.
David Lloyd George has pad
locked his Liberal "war chest" and
withholds support from the national
government.
Labor Platform Set
The Labor party, in annual con
clave at Scarborough, gaily launched
its opposition campaign. "We must
go forward decisively and courage
ously to a socialist society," said
Arthur Henderson, who has Mac-
Donald's old place as the leader of
Labor.
