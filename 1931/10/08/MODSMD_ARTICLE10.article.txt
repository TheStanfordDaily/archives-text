# D. TULLY GIVEN 2ND PLAY LEAD BY HELVENSTON
## Campbell And Crary Cast; Cummins Gets Comedy Role In Play 
### 
Cool, confident, handsome, and !
! self-assured Kate Pettigrew, second j
| feminine lead in '"Berkeley Square j
! is to be played by Dorothy Tully. i
| As the society belle, her part will !
I closely rival that of Helen, played
iby Peg Randall Converse, in the
| audience's interest.
| Dorothy Tully's well-modulated j
' voice especially fits her for her part, |
| which calls for a clever characteri- J
i zation of a fashionable English gen- |
i tlewoman. Her previous work here j
was in Noel Coward's "The Young I
Idea" and in "The Adding Machine," j
! which was produced in a summer j
j quarter.
Proven Actor
Another actor of proven ability !
' was cast when Harold Helvenston j
chose Don Campbell to portray the j
i difficult part of the Ambassador. In j
many ways this part as the elderly j
\ and distinguished statesman will be |
, similar to Lord Dedham in "Wings j
Over Europe." Little more can be j
I said than that in this play, which j
I was so successful that three request j
I presentations were given, Camp- |
bell's performance was one of the j
finest.
As Lady Anne Pettigrew, Cathe- |
rine Crary will be called upon for j
an entirely new type of dramatic i
; characterization. Mrs. Higgins in
; "Pygmalion" and one of the leads j
j in "The Hairy Ape" established for I
| her an enviable reputation on the
i Stanfodd stage.
Cummins Cast
Supplying an essential and enter- j
j taining half-humorous and half- j
j comic bit, Hamilton Cummins is to j
i play the amiable Duke of Cumber- j
land.
| In these days of depression an in- I
teresting sidelight on John L. Bal- i
1 derson's play is the comment made j
! by Heywood Brown in the "Evening j
j Telegram "If you plan to see only j
! one play this year, go to 'Berkeley I
i Square.' If your budget provides j
j two evenings in the theatre, see it'
I twice."
