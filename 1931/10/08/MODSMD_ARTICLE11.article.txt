# COOLIDGE SUPPORT OF HOOVER CAUSES G.O.P. RESENTMENT
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 7 (/P). — The j
' more professional Republicans pon- j
i der the Coolidge renunciation and j
i "impersonal" indorsement of Hoo- i
1 ver, the deeper is their chagrin, the i
1 keener their disappointment and the j
■ greater their resentment.
As long as the most generally;
j popular man in the party remained j
j a mystery, he was an intriguing and i
inviting figure. In dispelling the
■ mystery Coolidge unquestionably j
! lost a lot of the hold he had gained \
| on the affections of party leaders in i
j all sections of the country.
"Hard Luck" Told
This'group embraces a very large j
number of leaders who sincerely j
believe that Hoover cannot win on
j present form. They concede that he !
| has had "harder luck" than any |
; President since Lincoln. Any sym- j
J pathy they may feel for him per- j
' sonally, however, is outweighed by j
j individual grievances due to eco- i
! nomic irritations and the methods '
j employed by him in handling them. |
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. (/P.) — 1
President Hoover will discuss war;
bets and reparations with Premiei* j
I Laval when he comes to Washington. 1
