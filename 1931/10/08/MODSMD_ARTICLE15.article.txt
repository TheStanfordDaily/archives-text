# GRID MEN GIVEN LIGHT WORKOUT ON WEDNESDAY
## Gophers Practice Secretly In Memorial Stadium At California 
### Lowell Cox 
With only one stiff practice session
i remaining before the Minnesota
game, three positions on Stanford's
starting lineup are still uncertain.
Left guard is the principal post in
| doubt, with Hulen, Scribner, and
Bigelow all possibilities. Hulen is
i considered the most likely to draw
' the starting assignment, however,
I because of his experience.
Barkfield Uncertain
In the backfield two positions have
' not been definitely decided, full
-1 back and right half. As announced
lin the Daily several days ago, Allen
and Lambert are the most probable
j starters, although Rintala might
i start at full and Caddell at half.
I Hillman at quarter and Moffatt at
1 left half will complete the quartet.
George Grey, left tackle and best
place kicker on the squad, has not
j been in uniform this week because
jof a leg injury received in the
1 Santa Clara tilt. Hand has been

! named to start at his post, and in
j dications are that Grey will see lit-
J tie, if any, service against the Go
; phers.
Fundamentals Stressed
j Colvin and Tod will be at the
i ends, Ehrhorn at the other tackle,
Corbus and px-obably Hulen at
j guards, and Marks at center,
| cording to a semi-official announce
j ment last night.
i Warner sent the Indians through
: only a light workout yesterday,
stressing fundamentals and signal
drill. The five Minnesota newspa
l permen who followed the Gophers
1 to the coast dropped in on the prac
tice to size up the Indian squad, but
were not rewarded by a scrimmage.
Gophers Here Friday
A stiffer session will probably be
in order today, after which Warner
; may announce the complete starting
j eleven.
Meanwhile over at California
i Coach Fritz Crisler has been sending
i the Minnesota squad through secret
| workouts in the Memorial Stadium.
The Gophers will hold their final
j practice at Berkeley today, and are
1 expected to invade the Farm tomor
j row for their first glimpse of the
I scene of Saturday's game.
Offense Deceptive
Crisler is being assisted by Dr.
Boles in preparing a defense against
' Stanford's intricate offense.
i While Gopher workouts have been
' surrounded by the strictest secrecy,
! P.I.P. service reports indicate that
| their offense shows much deception,
j with reverses clicking with great
! smoothness. Their passing attack
i appears particularly dangerous, ac
j cording to reports.
Crisler sent his chai'ges through
j a fairly light workout yesterday, cli-
I maxing it with a dummy scrimmage.
