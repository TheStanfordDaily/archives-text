## Contest Awaits B.A.C. Approval; Contest To Be Held On Frosh Football Field Or The Gray Field, Cost Of Repairing Turf To Be Mutual VOTE STANDS AS SOPH 110-2; FROSH 202-74 Frosh Pledge Selves To Refrain From Participating In Encina Raids This Year Or In Future 
### 
DOTH sophomores and freshmen, in two meetings held last night, cast
i an overwhelming vote of approval to the proposed annual mudfight in
| place of the tie-up plus the Encina raid.
Sophomores favored the change 110 to 2, and the freshmen 202 1o 71.
leaving no doubt as to the choice of either class. The actual contest will
now he held pending B.A.C. approval, and is to take place either on the
freshman football field or the Gray field, as both classes have agreed to
pay the cost of repairing the turf. This does away with the numerous

' injuries common to the fights of
| former years, which were held in
: the rocky bottom of Lagunita.
The actual proposition outlined
j for the balloting was as follows:
' ''The Class of '35 desires to substi
! tute the mud-fight for the tie-up as
i the annual sophomore-freshman
! meeting. Furthermore, as a class
I and as individuals the frosh pledge
I themselves not to participate in any
! way in an Encina raid either this
j year or in the future."
| Everything points to a first class
\ tussle a la mud next Thuhsday, as
I both sides are at sword's points,
j due to the sad failure of Tuesday
I night's Encina raid. Furthermore,
the sophs have not come out on the
victorious end of a tie-up for all of
three years, and are overly anxious
i to avenge their past failures.
