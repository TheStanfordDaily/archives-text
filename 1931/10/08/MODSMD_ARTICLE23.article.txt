# GIGANTIC BIG GAME BONFIRE HINTED IF PINES ARE FELLED
## 
### 
This year may see the biggest
Eig Game bonfire in Stanford his
tory if 400 Monterey pine and
spruce on the campus are sent
crashing to their deaths in a blaze
of glory.
The trees —says Dr. Henry E.
Burke, chief entomologist of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture—
are so diseased by pine beetles as
to be a menace to their healthy
neighbors, and even worthless as
salvage lumber.
Trees Doomed
Sixteen years' drought plus the
invading hordes of beetle (who is
dignified as Dendroctonus Valens)
have doomed a startling percentage
of the native Monterey spruce and
pine.
Left standing, Dr. Burke declares,
Ihese diseased and dying trees will
serve only to spread the infection
throughout the remaining thousands
of trees which clothe the campus.
Great Bonfire Fuel
Besides serving as .a remedy to
the situation, the amputated trees
would make enviable pickings for
the Class of '35. This year's Campa
nile staggers the imagination. Score:
of pine mounting to make its stately
walls, tall spruce ribbing it within,
and stuffed by a million dry branch
es, the result would be not unlike
a holocaust of the Chrysler bxiild
ing.
Dr. Burke volunteers his services
in picking out the condemned trees,
in case of University action toward
their removal. By an expense of
$20,000 he believes that a part of
these could be saved, but the Mon
terey evergreens, natives of the re
gion, have suffered more heavily
from the drought than other trees
imported from dryer regions.
