The tie-up's oil'; the mud fight's on.
Not since 1!>27 have freshmen and sophomores been
privileged to settle their class rivalry by tossing each other
in the mud, but last night members of both classes voted
lo abandon the tie-up in favor of the traditional manner
of combat.
Four years ago, the mud-fight was shelved as being 100
rough, among other things. The tie-up has not proved an
adequate substitute, .lust as many men have been hurt in
that scrap as in its predecessor, and it did not appeal to
the youths in the same way.
The decision to hold the mudfight on a turf field elimi
nates the possibility of injury prevalent four years ago,
when tlie encounter was held on the rocky floor of Lagu
nita. Although the R.A.C. has not yet sanctioned the use
of either the freshman or drays' fields, it can have no valid
objections so long as the two classes agree to pay for the
damage done. 1
One thing is certain. Willi raids barred by official de
cree, the two classes need some sort of a melee, not only to
blow off steam, but to unify the freshmen. The raid was
formerly the freshmen's baptism by fire as a class of the
Cnivcrsity; now the mud-fight will replace that. Tradition
is preserved and the frosh and sophs are given a better
chance lo meet each oilier informally. Tear 'em apart,
men !
