# BACK TO THE CAMPUS

In the midst of all llie general moaning about the de
pression, it is discovered and deplored that "Dates are
made hv fewer men and these men are making fewer
dates." Il is taken for granted that this is an evil. Consid
< red superficially, dates are not terrifically important, but
ill the bottom, dates represent the social life of the college
and furnish many of the pleasantest contacts and friend
ships made among the students.
If is not hard to understand the present decline in the
percentage of dates. In tlie past few years il has gradually
become the custom to place a premium upon dating to the
city, dates which mean dancing at a hotel, or dinner and
(he theater, or the theater and supper, any one of which
ran up a formidable reckoning. Not just a few of the men,
but a majority, perhaps even three-quarters, find this year
111 a t a curtailed allowance makes an evening in the city
cither impractical or out of the question except on rare
occasions. As a result the men slay at home and play
cards, or rough it to the Palo Alto shows.
But why are the students, men and women, forced to
resign themselves to these conditions? The depression
need not be an unmitigated evil. Half the campus pouring
iij) to San Francisco every week-end certainly had its
drawbacks. In the first place it damaged campus social
life, and broke down the unity and the sense of friendli
ness among the students which is supposed to have existed
in the early days of the University. In the second place, a
student's contacts become more and more limited when
confined as a rule to those made in the extremely small
group with whom he habitually went to the city.
Something, therefore, can be salvaged out of almost
universal slimness of pockelbooks. This year, with every
one slaving at home, the University has an excellent
chance to recapture the informal good times, inexpensive
.••n<l accessible to all the students, that belonged to the
"good old days."
As a step toward this, dances every Friday night, or
two Fridays out of the month, could be held in the
Women's Clubhouse, from nine to twelve, or from nine
i:iitil eleven, if the latter made the difference in the cost of
the orchestra very appreciable. These dances would be an
improvement over the jollv-ups, because they would last
longer, and would not be so crowded, and (most impor
tant) the Stanford man who made an engagement for the
dance would not come up against the necessity of taking
his friend to a picture show or Dinah's after eight o'clock
by way of amusement, to finish the evening. In the hands
of an committee the dances could be made to run
smoothly. Admission need only be fifteen cents for each
student, or simply twenty-live cents for each couple. A stu
dent orchestra, preferably, could furnish the music.
The question is: would these dances be attended? Judg
ing bv the popularity of the jolly-ups, there is little doubt
aboul Ibis. The initial dances would be most difficult.
Once well started, the informal Friday night dances would
assume an important place in the Stanford social calendar.
In a questionnaire given to students al Washington
University, St. Louis, Mo., the following results were ob
tained : "Intelligence and old-fashioned manners, with pet
ting not necessary, make up the Perfect Man," one-fourth
enjoy petting but none expect to be kissed on the first date
and blind dates are acceptable.
My, my! We hope the Stanford freshman women don't
"el disillusioned at the Roble Formal!
