# BULL SESSION
## THE 						SOPH RAID THAT WASN'T 
### 
The Class of '34 looked and talked
big to the humble frosh and the
Class of '35 adopted similar tactics
in handling the sophs; the result
being 0 to 0, favor the University.
The people most anxious for a fight
between the sophs and frosh are the
upperclassmen who want a free
show; and those individuals who en
joy a good free-for-all—anytime or
any play on any occasion—tradition
or no tradition.
There are many on the campus
and many more proud alumni who
will no doubt stage vituperous at
tacks on the present underclassmen
who arc changing the Stanford
"RED" to a faded and anemic pink.
Many will no doubt think that the
University has suffered one of ils
major setbacks with the definite end
of that so-called grand tradition—
the sophomore raid.
While admitting that our "raid"
days were enjoyable, and exciting—
and form material to weave college
yarns for those that enjoy reading
"The Motor Boat Boys in College or
How Jim Benson Scored in the Last
Minute," we nevertheless leel that
it is for the advancement of Stan
ford that what has happened, has
happened. Exhibitions like the
"raid" tend to remind people that,
perhaps, the College Comedies are
not so far wrong after all. The fact
that the underclassmen waste the
evening is not of much importance;
activity in a raid tends to lower and

! pervert those mythical and indefinite
things termed academic ideals.
When students in an institution
I of higher learning—and never forget
that this is such a place—spend
hours worrying, talking, planning,
and thinking raid, what chance has
International Procedure or Greek
Mythology to find their place in the
i sun? When the man worthwhile is
the man who can rip eight pairs of
i trousers off the opposition and nail
I his trophies on his wall, what op
i portunity is there to appreciate the
true meaning of college?
Of course, we students are not old
! men; and a certain amount of bally
hoo and rough-house is necessary
jto make education attractive, but
1 where movie stuff should end and
i University begin mast be clearly
defined or else colleges degenerate
into places whei-e people—indis
posed to the business world and dis
| pcsed to having a hell of a good
! time—congregate in such numbers
that education ceases, civilization
decays, and the world comes to a
! speedy and sad end.
There are some colleges where
i ballyhoo is so prevalent that one
| hardly knows whether he is on a
university campus or a Universal
! Studio set. Stanford must never fall
to such an ebb; and the termination
1 of soph raids should set the frosh
to seeking higher and better things
—at least that is how the theory
, runs. —Abe MellinkofF.

"RED" to a faded and anemic pink.
Many will no doubt think that the
University has suffered one of ils
major setbacks with the definite end
of that so-called grand tradition—
the sophomore raid.
While admitting that our "raid"
days were enjoyable, and exciting—
and form material to weave college
yarns for those that enjoy reading
"The Motor Boat Boys in College or
How Jim Benson Scored in the Last
Minute," we nevertheless leel that
it is for the advancement of Stan
ford that what has happened, has
happened. Exhibitions like the
"raid" tend to remind people that,
perhaps, the College Comedies are
not so far wrong after all. The fact
that the underclassmen waste the
evening is not of much importance;
activity in a raid tends to lower and

! pervert those mythical and indefinite
things termed academic ideals.
When students in an institution
I of higher learning—and never forget
that this is such a place—spend
hours worrying, talking, planning,

International Procedure or Greek
Mythology to find their place in the

the man who can rip eight pairs of
i trousers off the opposition and nail
I his trophies on his wall, what op
i portunity is there to appreciate the
true meaning of college?
Of course, we students are not old

that education ceases, civilization
decays, and the world comes to a

There are some colleges where
i ballyhoo is so prevalent that one

The Class of '34 looked and talked
big to the humble frosh and the
Class of '35 adopted similar tactics
in handling the sophs; the result
being 0 to 0, favor the University.
The people most anxious for a fight
between the sophs and frosh are the
upperclassmen who want a free
