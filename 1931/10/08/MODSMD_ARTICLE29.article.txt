BACK STREETS—By Fannie Hurst. ,
New York. J. J. Litlle & Ives.
I m.
j Like Fannie Hurst and as usual j
too much Fannie ■ Hurst. There are |
481 pages in this book. The first j
pages adequately describe Ray 1
Schmidt, an attractive, self-reliant ;
' girl; the next 400 pages monoton- !
ously tell of her travel up and then |
i down. The effect is depressing. !
Whether it is from the monotony of |
; the style or the realism of the plot j
is a question for Fannie's fans to dis- I
cus.
j Ray Schmidt is the gifted daughter
of a plodding father, a German mer
; chant in Cincinnati. Ray is endowed j
1 with Style. This quality predestines
i her to be noticed and admired. Ray
j is not, like the other girls, simple.
| She is too subtle for her contem
j poraries, and her independence na
i turally causes gossip. Cincinnati of
! the 'nineties dates her up but still
' doesn't understand her.
One night Ray's father dies. Ray
j continues working in her father's
1 store. About a year afterward she
i meets Walter Saxel. Walter is a
j very agreeable person and at least
| Ray falls in love. One is not sure
; about Walter.
| Walter has a great admiration for
i his mother and respects her opin
j ion. He wants her to know Ray, al
| though he thinks that it would be
| best for their meeting to appear to
Ibe accidental. He is not sure his
J mother will approve of Ray. They
j arrange to meet by the lion's cage
|al the park on Sunday morning. j
If Ray had not been prevented |
i from meeting Walter's mother that >
! Sunday morning probably her life
! would have been entirely different
I and it would not have been spent
lon "back streets." —E. T. P. I

ABOVE THE DARK TUMULT—Ey
Hugh Walpole. Garden City, N.Y. j
Doubleday, Doran & Company.
1931.
i "My Dear Walter,
"I hope that you will not take this I
| Tale too seriously. Once before I
: had a holiday and wrote a story !
! about a Red-Haired Man and have
been distressed ever since at the I
| scientific remarks made about that I

, gentleman! .. . says Mr. Walpole
I by way of dedication.
No one is likely to take seriously
; a tale about a person named Dick
i Gunn, who has only half a crown,
; a volume of '"Don Quixote," and
' needs a haircut throughout the
| whole book. Practically all the other
! characters except the heroine,
i Helen, are stark mad.
! Mr. Walpole's latest book seems
| to achieve what "The Porti'ait of
j a Man With Red Hair" failed to do.
I Each is the story of a single night's
! fantastic adventure, but "Above the
; Dark Tumult" has a serious and not
i very cheerful theme underlying the
fantasy. The theme is the hard lot
! of a man who is a misfit because ha
is too much of an idealist. Oswald
is the unfortunate man who is well
\ endowed yet lacks adaptability and
{so is a burden to himself and to so
| ciety.
I This contrast between fancy and
i the stern realities of life lends the
j convincing quality that makes the
' book worth # reading in addition to its
being undoubtedly entertaining.
—E. T. P.
