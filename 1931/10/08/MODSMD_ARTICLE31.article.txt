Someone got us into an argument
the other day on the comparative
beauties of the inland and coast
routes to Los Angeles. Chamber of !
Commerce reports might be like
this—
The Coast Route —Opening with
a charming vista of automobile tire
advertisements near Los Angples,
the road winds through the pictur
esque subdivision board region to
the breath-taking cigarette and to
bacco scenery, and advancing some
two hundred miles through the I
scenic soda pop and kidney pill re
gion comes to the pleasant valley of 1
Burma Shave.
This eloquent poetry—"Half a j
dollar —half a buck—don't use cream 1
—use our muck—Burma Shave," I
lends its melodious influence almost j
to San Francisco, where attractive i
Ei.t at Dinah's—Drink at Hoopla's
signs conduct the tourist to San j
Francisco.
The best way to travel the inland
route is to put a blanket over your J
head and read the back section of
the Saturday Evening Post.
"Drink <o me only with thine
eyes," sang Old Hen Johnson. J
Well, they must have had wood
alcohol even in those days.
And this uneventful weather j
bothers us. When it is rainy or
cloudy and we pick somebody up
on the Paly-campus trip we can al- j
ways start conversation about it \
looks like rain and what do you
think. Or if it's hot we can whew- .
whew, jerk at our collar and make I
our gag about it isn't the weather |
it's the stupidity. But with weather
like this there isn't a thing to say !
except about What the Boys Are |
Going to Do Saturday, and conse- '
quently our Social Life is going all
to seed.
And we welcome contribs here,
hut when people write gags like
"I saw a couple of Arabs last
night.'' "Ah, but I saw a Bed
ouin," we think some adminis
trative action should be taken.
