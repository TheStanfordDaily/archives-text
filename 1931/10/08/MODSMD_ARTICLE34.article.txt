VANCOUVER, 8.C., Oct. 7 (Uni
versal Service). â€”Compel the next
Congress to relieve the unemploy
ment situation, or bring about a po
litical revolution in 1932-
Edward Keating, former Congress
man from Colorado and editor of
Labor, offered this today as the slo
gan for the fifty-first annual con
vention of the American Federation
of Labor.
He shared the center of the con
vention slate with Ralph A. Horr,
Congressman from the first district
of Washington, who made an elo
quent appeal for the immediate
modification of the Volstead Act and
for the adoption of some such plan
as the $5,000,000,000 prosperity loan
advocated by William Randolph
Hearst.
