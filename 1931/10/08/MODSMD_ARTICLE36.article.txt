# HOOVER CONSIDERS QUESTION OF DEBT HOLIDAY EXTENSION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7. (/P) —
President Hoover is considering

weigh the power of the opposition.
At last night's White House confer

lon this one subject, Chairman

j tions Committee served notice he

debt payments unless Europe firsL
used the knife severely on her

He declared it unwise and unjust
