# JACKSON ADDRESSES PALO ALTO KIWANIS
## 
### 
Dean J. Hugh Jackson of the |
Graduate School of Business re- i
I cently spoke before the Palo Alto ;
j Kiwanis Club on the school and its i
j relation to the business world.
| Instead of the "we have no place
i for college men here" attitude of
| business men, Jackson said, senti
! ment has changed. He illustrated
this with the statement of the head
| of a San Francisco firm who has j
hired Stanford Business School j
! graduates:
j "I have come to the conclusion j
! that the hope of my business lies in i
college-trained men."
"The record of the graduates of i
the school since its institution has j
been satisfactory," said Jackson.
