# FALL ASKS PAROLE IN NEW ENDEAVOR TO GAIN FREEDOM
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (/}').—Al- |
bert B. Fall sought today to regain
the freedom of which he was de
j prived after conviction for accepting
1 a bribe as Secretary of the Interior.
The former Cabinet officer applied
j to the Department of Justice for a !
parole. He is serving a year and a
day in the New Mexico state prison
I and will be eligible for parole No-
I vember 22.
Fall's prison term and a $100,000
fine were imposed after a jury in the
District of Columbia Supreme Court
had decided that $100,000 which he
I received from Edward L. Doheny
was a bribe. Fall had contended it
was a loan.
Subsequent to the transfer of the !
money, Fall, as Secretary of the In-
I terior, executed a l?ase on the Elk j
j Hills, California, naval petroleum |
reserve to Doheny's Pan-American j
Petroleum Company. Doheny, who I
was brought to trial separately, was
acquitted of the bribery charge.
Fall's attorneys argued that his j
extreme age and ill health made the
prison term a threat to his life, j
Consequently, the court permitted
his incarceration in the high, dry
climate of New Mexico rather than :
the sea-level humidity of Washing
ton.
The Federal Parole Board is to
hold a meeting here within a few ;
. | days and the case may come up
: ■ then. The denial of a pardon will !
• have no bearing upon the parole
' application.
