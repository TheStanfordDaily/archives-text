# WOMEN'S FORENSIC SQUAD MAY DEBATE NEVADA OVER AIR
## 
### 
With the probability of a radio
debate with the University of Ne
vada at Reno and the possibility of
the subject being "Divorce," the
women's debating activities for this
quarter will begin with tryouts next
Wednesday.
Professor James G. Emerson
men's debate coach, will train the
women this year rather than Pro
fessor Gordon, as was erroneously
announced.
"The present skill of the women
in debating warrants them a posi
tion of greater importance than was
theirs formerly," Emerson said yes
terday. "The participation of ' a
woman in this spring's Joffre De
bate is an evidence of this ability."
