# MIXING FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL
## 
### Feg Murray 
In this, the transition period of
j sports, when the World Series and
I early football games overlap, it
should be timely to consider the
! cases of two of football's former
greats who have turned to profes
j sional baseball, and who give prom
: ise of doing as well on the diamond
! as they did on the gridiron.
The question whether football and
| baseball mix is an old one, for col-
I lege pigskin stars have turned to
I the horsehide game for a quarter of
[ a century or more, some with great
j success and others with little or
i none. Christy Mathewson, Eddie
, Collins, Frank Frisch, the Sswell
j brothers, Riggs Stephenson, Lou
! Gehrig, and Orvie Overall all made
good in the majors after being more
1 or less successful at football in their
j undergraduate days. Jim Thorpe,
greatest of all football playe-rs, Ernie
Nevers, Walter French, Morris
Badgro, and many others found that
I their baseball ability, judged by a
■ big league standard, was not as great
I as their skill at football.
But to get on the subject of Bruce
Caldwell and Ken Strong, All—

(Americans both, and boys who could j
run, kick, pass, and play a heady ;
defensive game with equal dexter- j
il.y. Bruce Caldwell starred with I
Yale, until somebody dug up the |
fact that he was ineligible because '
he had played part of a game with j
Brown or some other institution of :
football (pardon me, I mean learn
ing). Ken Strong was New York
University's big hero, and a unani
mous All-America choice a year
after Caldwell (1928). Now Ken has
just finished a good season with
Toronto, where his timely clouting
and good fielding in 117 games got
him a .345 average and many lines oi'
praise. Caldwell outshone all his
rivals in the Eastern League as a
member of the New Haven team,
batting .360, hitting 38 homers, and
banging in 127 runs. As Bruce was
also part owner, secretary and
treasurer of the New Haven Club, as
well as first-baseman, he engineered
a profitable deal whereby he sold
an option on his services to Brook
lyn for 1932. Whether or not the
Dodgers will exercise this option
remains to be seen.

good in the majors after being more
1 or less successful at football in their
j undergraduate days. Jim Thorpe,
greatest of all football playe-rs, Ernie
Nevers, Walter French, Morris
Badgro, and many others found that
I their baseball ability, judged by a
■ big league standard, was not as great
I as their skill at football.
But to get on the subject of Bruce
Caldwell and Ken Strong, All—

(Americans both, and boys who could j
run, kick, pass, and play a heady ;
defensive game with equal dexter- j
il.y. Bruce Caldwell starred with I
Yale, until somebody dug up the |
fact that he was ineligible because '
he had played part of a game with j
Brown or some other institution of :
football (pardon me, I mean learn
ing). Ken Strong was New York
University's big hero, and a unani
mous All-America choice a year
after Caldwell (1928). Now Ken has
just finished a good season with
Toronto, where his timely clouting
and good fielding in 117 games got
him a .345 average and many lines oi'
praise. Caldwell outshone all his
rivals in the Eastern League as a
member of the New Haven team,
batting .360, hitting 38 homers, and
banging in 127 runs. As Bruce was
also part owner, secretary and
treasurer of the New Haven Club, as
well as first-baseman, he engineered
a profitable deal whereby he sold
an option on his services to Brook
lyn for 1932. Whether or not the
Dodgers will exercise this option
remains to be seen.

In this, the transition period of
j sports, when the World Series and
I early football games overlap, it
should be timely to consider the
! cases of two of football's former
greats who have turned to profes
j sional baseball, and who give prom
: ise of doing as well on the diamond
! as they did on the gridiron.
The question whether football and
| baseball mix is an old one, for col-
I lege pigskin stars have turned to
I the horsehide game for a quarter of
[ a century or more, some with great
j success and others with little or
i none. Christy Mathewson, Eddie
, Collins, Frank Frisch, the Sswell
j brothers, Riggs Stephenson, Lou
! Gehrig, and Orvie Overall all made
good in the majors after being more
1 or less successful at football in their
j undergraduate days. Jim Thorpe,
greatest of all football playe-rs, Ernie
Nevers, Walter French, Morris
Badgro, and many others found that
I their baseball ability, judged by a
■ big league standard, was not as great
I as their skill at football.
