# VISITING FRESHMEN FALSELY STATED TO BE WEAK TEAM
## Coach Bradshaw Tries New Men To Fill Places Left By Injured 
### 
If the Stanford freshmen have any j
: single factor to guard against in j
their approaching clash with the
U.C.L.A. cubs this Saturday, it is
the element of over-confidence.
Any reports that the invading !
freshman team is weak must be dis- i
i counted. Early news that Los An- !
geles J.C. had waded right through 1
their heavier opponents in a prac- I
| tice scrimmage with the Westwood
eleven has been modified.
! It appears that the team through '
: which Los Angeles drove for all I
I their points was composed of sec- j
! ond- and third-string men. It was i
i an entirely different story when the "j
i regulars were on the field.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's four |
1 disabled men are still out of uni- !
form. During last night's practice
i Trompas ran plays with the first
string in the place of the flashy
Bowles at left half.
A new man, Abrahamson, worked
i at left end for Durkee. The latter I
! has a hand in a cast, in addition to ]
| an injured nose, and is unlikely to i
! see action against the Uclans. Abra
i hamson has had experience at
tackle and in the backfield during
j his high-school days, but the posi- !
! tion of end is new to him. He is no
{ speedster but carries plenty of i
| weight.
Flippen, playing half on the sec
i ond team, showed up well defen
' sively. He hits with a powerful j
j drive, brings down his man, and is
1 seldom taken out of the play.
