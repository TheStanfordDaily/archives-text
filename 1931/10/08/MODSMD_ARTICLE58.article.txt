# TWO "IRON MEN"
## 
### 
"Iron man" performances will again be the order on Stanford's track
team this spring, according to present plans of "Dink" Templeton.
Dink indicated yesterday that he intends to use Ben "What-a-Man"
Eastman in the quarter-mile, 880, and relayevents, while Les Hables will
probably run both the sprints and the relay, at least in the major meets.
Following the 1.C.4-A. meet at Berkeley in July, Hubles may concentrate
on the 200 meter event for the Olympic Games.
But, as Templeton remarked, that's a helluva long time away.
