| LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7. (/I I )â€”A
i six-month-old heroine in her own
right gurgled modestly at the pro
; fusion of thanks tendered her today
; by twenty-six families saved from
! an apartment-hotel fire that caused
I $10,000 damage.
; Patricia Leland, the tiny heroine,
j was bothered by an acrid odor when
j she was awakened earTy this morn
' ing. She stood up in her crib, leaned
, over the side and slapped her sleep-
I ing mother, Mrs. T. M. Leland, in
the face. Mrs. Leland spread an
alarm.
While members- of the twenty-six
families made hasty exits, Miss Pa
tricia nonchalantly rode her'father's
shoulders down a fire department
ladder.
