# Cards Swamp A'S, 5-1, To Lead in Series
## "PEPPER" MARTIN TIES WORLD MARK FOR TOTAL HITS Hallahan, Rookie Prove Too Much For A's; Win Easy Game 
### Alan Gould 
SHIBE PARK, Philadelphia, Oct. !
7 (.fIP). — The "Wild Horse of the |
Osage," Pepper Martin, collaborated j
again today with the "Wild Will of :
the Pitching Peaks," Bill Hallahan, j
to baffle Ihe Athletics, perch vie- j
tory atop the National League ban- |
ner, and put the Cardinals within j
one game of the world baseball
championship.
The Cardinals romped easily to J
triumph in the fifth game of the se
ries, 5 to 1, as Hallahan posted his i
second straight victory over the i
world champions and Martin con- j
tinned on the wildest batting ram- j
page in the history of baseball's an- |
nual big show.
Cards Lead
It gave the Red Birds the lead, j
three games to two, an advantage j
enjoyed by the National League's |
forces for the first time in seven i
years. The Cardinals, now in com
mand, with only the great George ,
Earnshaw to do much worrying
about, return to their home grounds |
with two chances to capture the :
fourth and deciding contest.
The sixth game is scheduled Fri
day at St. Louis and the seventh, if ,
necessary, on Saturday.
The smartest piece of strategy '
since the series opened, the eleva- ;
tion of the sensational Pepper Mar
tin to the cleanup position in the j
Cardinal batting order in place of j
Sunny Jim Bottomley, was crowned j
with results of the gaudiest variety ;
as the rookie outfielder routed the
veteran Waite Hoyt and had the ,
Athletics shell-shocked for the fifth j
straight game with his personal ex- j
ploits.
Martin, with a nation's eyes upon j
him and even the A's own home |
town fans cheering for him, cele- j
brated the responsibility put upon i
him by smashing out three hits, in- j
eluding a home run into the left j
field stands, and driving home four j
of the five Cardinal tallies.
This stockily-built, 27 - year - old j
Okhihoman from the Osage country, ;
virtually single-handed, battered the 1
Athletics into defeat with just as i
much power as a slugger as he had 1
manifested previously in dazzling i
speed. i
He drove in the first run with a j
sacrifice fly, pointed out the exit for j
Hoyt in the sixth with a home run j
clout, with Frisch on base, and con- ;
eluded his day with a one - base !
drive that tallied Watkins in the j
eighth inning.
Martin tied the world series rec- i
ord when he ran his total hits up to ,
twelve for five games, equaling the |
achievement first registered by Buck
Herzog of the Giants in 1912 and i
duplicated by Joe Jackson of the j
White Sox in 1919 and by Sam Rice |
of the Senators in 1925.
The Cardinal buzz saw boosted his ,
batting mark for the series to .667 j
with his twelve blows in eighteen J
times at bat, and moved closer to a |
new all-time record to displace the j
figure of .625 that now stands to the j
credit of Babe Ruth.
But for the new ruling banning I
the .sacrifice fly as no time at bat, i
Martin would have had a perfect
afternoon at the plate. It was per
fect enough, from the viewpoint of
the Cardinals, and too much so for
the Athletics.

second straight victory over the i
world champions and Martin con- j
tinned on the wildest batting ram- j
page in the history of baseball's an- |
nual big show.
Cards Lead
It gave the Red Birds the lead, j
three games to two, an advantage j
enjoyed by the National League's |
forces for the first time in seven i
years. The Cardinals, now in com
mand, with only the great George ,
Earnshaw to do much worrying
about, return to their home grounds |
with two chances to capture the :
fourth and deciding contest.
The sixth game is scheduled Fri
day at St. Louis and the seventh, if ,
necessary, on Saturday.
The smartest piece of strategy '
since the series opened, the eleva- ;
tion of the sensational Pepper Mar
tin to the cleanup position in the j
Cardinal batting order in place of j
Sunny Jim Bottomley, was crowned j
with results of the gaudiest variety ;
as the rookie outfielder routed the
veteran Waite Hoyt and had the ,
Athletics shell-shocked for the fifth j
straight game with his personal ex- j
ploits.
Martin, with a nation's eyes upon j
him and even the A's own home |
town fans cheering for him, cele- j
brated the responsibility put upon i
him by smashing out three hits, in- j
eluding a home run into the left j
field stands, and driving home four j
of the five Cardinal tallies.
This stockily-built, 27 - year - old j
Okhihoman from the Osage country, ;
virtually single-handed, battered the 1
Athletics into defeat with just as i
much power as a slugger as he had 1
manifested previously in dazzling i
speed. i
He drove in the first run with a j
sacrifice fly, pointed out the exit for j
Hoyt in the sixth with a home run j
clout, with Frisch on base, and con- ;
eluded his day with a one - base !
drive that tallied Watkins in the j
eighth inning.
Martin tied the world series rec- i
ord when he ran his total hits up to ,
twelve for five games, equaling the |
achievement first registered by Buck
Herzog of the Giants in 1912 and i
duplicated by Joe Jackson of the j
White Sox in 1919 and by Sam Rice |
of the Senators in 1925.
The Cardinal buzz saw boosted his ,
batting mark for the series to .667 j
with his twelve blows in eighteen J
times at bat, and moved closer to a |
new all-time record to displace the j
figure of .625 that now stands to the j
credit of Babe Ruth.
But for the new ruling banning I
the .sacrifice fly as no time at bat, i
Martin would have had a perfect
afternoon at the plate. It was per
fect enough, from the viewpoint of
the Cardinals, and too much so for
the Athletics.
