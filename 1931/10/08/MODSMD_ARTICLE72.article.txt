of 6.037 had registered at the Lhii- !
versity of California at Los Angeles j
by the end of the first two weeks j
of the enrollment period, according '
to announcement by Recorder H.
M. Showman. These are all full
time, undergraduate students, Mr. j
Showman announced, and the total
eclipses all former totals of previous
years for the same period.
Totals for the past three years
are cited by Showman for purposes
of comparison. In 1928 a total of
5,814 students had registered during
the first two weeks. The first two
weeks of 1929 brought a total of
5,680. Last year, in 1930, a total of
5,708 students registered the first
two weeks.
It is the belief of the recorder that
the total enrollment for the school
year of 1931-32 will be about 7.000.
