STOCKBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 7
(/P). â€” Daniel Chester French, 81,
dean of American sculptors, died at
his summer home today. He had
been in ailing health for several
months.
His first public work, unveiled the
day before he was 25 years of age,
brought him fame. It was a statue
of "The Minute Man' 1 which stands
by the Concord bridge in tribute to
the farmers who turned back the
British invaders in 1775.
