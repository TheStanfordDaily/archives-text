# CONGRESS LEADERS BELIEVE ECONOMIC PROGRAM HELPFUL

### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (fP). â€”
Hopeful that the economic program
agreed upon at the White House
will be helpful, congressional lead
ers turned today to cautious con
siderution of detailed legislative
plans for carrying it into execution.
The Democratic and Republican
members of Congress who attended
the parley publicly spoke the ap
proval which they gave the general
program presented by President
Hoover last night.
A discordant note was sounded by
Senator Brookhart, of lowa, one of
the Republican independents, who
termed the White House conference
"a Wall Street party." He called for
the resignations of Secretary Mel
lon and Governor Meyer of the
Federal Reserve Board.
Senator Vandenberg, Republican,
of Michigan, described the economic
program as the "dawn of a new day"
and his optimism was shared by
many others on Capitol Hill.
No early meetings of congression
al committees to consider the legis
lation which may be necessary are
in prospect and there is every evi
dence that careful study will be
given before the contemplated
amendments of the Federal Reserve
and banking acts and of the farm
loan board are enacted.
