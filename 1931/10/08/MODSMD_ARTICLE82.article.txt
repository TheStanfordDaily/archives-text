WENATCHEE, Wash., Oct. 7. —
Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon,
Jr., first to fly from Japan to the
United States in a heavier than air
craft, today amplified charges made
in a banquet speech last night by
Pangborn that their difficulties in
Japan were heightened by lack of
assistance from United States Am
bassador Forbes.
"Forbes was the most wishy
washy representative of the United
States government that we encoun
tered in our journey through Eu
rope and Asia," both flyers declared
today. "When we were going
through the ordeal of repeated ex
aminations by Japanese officials, we
got no aid. E'orbes told us that if he
aided us it would appear as if we
were spies, and by, keeping out
of it really helped us.
"We appealed to Col. Charles A.
Lindbergh, who told us that while
he would like to help, there wasn't
a thing he could do."
