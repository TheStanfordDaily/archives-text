### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (/P).
President Hoover's plan for speed
ing prosperity's return was spurred
forward today by the wholehearted
co-operation of America's financial
titans.
The $500,000,000 credit pool pro
posed by the chief executive is to be
formally incorpoi-ated by Saturday.
Soon afterward, it will be put to its
task of loosening the frozen assets
now clogging the channels of com
merce.
Mr. Hoover received this word to
day from Governor Harrison of the
New York Federal Reserve Bank,
to whom was given the assignment
of marshaling the nation's reserve
dollars into this momentous move

for better times.
Reveal Secret Parley
In the meanwhile there was un
folded an intimate tale of the care
ful, methodical planning from which
the project grew, including a secret
meeting between the President and
a group of influential bankers Sun
day night at Secretary Mellons
apartment.
Some confusion arose today as to
how far the administration expects
to go in broadening the basis upon
which securities are discounted by
the Fede'al Reserve system.
