Tl»i- I)ay Before, Oct. !)—
Stanford will play Minnesota as
a rather dull preliminary to the
Chappie-Daily contest, and al
though it may seem pointless to
come ahead of time and be forced
1o witness such a mediocre starter,
still, desirable seats are at premium
for the great feature fracas to fol
low. and you are advised to come
early.
The two teams left Foulodor Field
and Garbage Dump Glen, respec
tively, yesterday, for the scene of
the contest, and each had a light
breakfast of raw rutabaga smoth
ered in mustard, waffles, ham and
eggs, pigs' knuckles, corn on tho
cob, candied pineapple, and si raw
berry shortcake. After 1 snack
I bey all went to bed right after the

rutabaga-mustard combination.
J "If my boys will fight and don't |
die tonight, we look like a cinch,"
said Butch Cleanser, as his face be
' gun to turn greeft.
"After eating at training table i
we're all 'at sea' about the game," l
said Murky Mick, "but we won't be
| so sick tomorrow."
