# PLAY CASTING IS NEARING FINISH
## Dickey, Girzi, Hatfield, And Sandoe Are Cast 
### 
With Peg Randall Converse cast
in the leading role of "Berkeley
Square" and the male lead as yet
undecided, Harold Helvenston last
night announced most of the re
maining characters of the play.
David Dickey, well remembered
for his budget proposals as Matthew
Grindle, Chancellor of the Excheq
uer, in ''Wings Over Europe," will
play Lord Stanley.
Girzi Cast
Another member of the cast in
that now traditional play will play
Tom Pettigrew, a swaggering very
much-would-be man about town,
Edward Girzi, who has been cast
for this part, did an excellent piece
in Elmer Rice's "See Naples and
Die," and also jjlayed in the "Mid
summer Night's Dream."
Living up to the custom of all
plays "Berkeley Square" has the
usual maid part. However the Stan
ford audience will be treated to a
ravishing dark-haired actress who
gives promise of making even her
small part one of the high-lights of
the show. A newcomer to dramatics
here, Kathleen Hatfield has been
chosen to make her stage debut as
the enchanting vivacious maid.
Sandoe Is Suitor
James Sandoe, who is acting
Throstle, the meek, devoted, and
hopeless suitor for Helen Pettigrew's
favor, was also cast last night. Fi
nal choice of characters will be
made today with the possible ex
ception of Peter Standish, the male
lead.
Rehearsals for Act I are being
started immediately and members of
the cast in Scene I will practice
today at 3 o'clock, Helvenston an
nounced.
