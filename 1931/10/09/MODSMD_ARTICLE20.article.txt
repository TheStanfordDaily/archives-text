may enter Che game with Minnesota tomorrow without the
the services of Captain Harry Hillman. liillman. whose smashing play
at quarterback in the Santa Clara game last week indicated that he was
at a peak of form, was taken to the Palo Alto Hospital late Wednesday
night suffering from a "severe cold" and a temperature of 102. Tlv.'
"severe cold may mean an attack of flu. Kidman's condition was not
made public until last night, when it was announced that his temperature
was near normal and that he might be able to start tomorrow. Definite

* decision, however, as to whether or
not the Indian leader will be able
to play will not be made by his
; physician until this morning.
STRONG DEFENSE
I Phil Baker, sensation of early sea
son games, will carry the quarter
| back burden if Hillman is unable to
j start. Baker is a steady, consistent
j player, lacking the power of Hill
{ man on line smashing, but a tower
|of strength on defense. His per
formance in backing up the line
j against the Olympic Club was one
j of the few features of the game.
Meanwhile Warner has announced
l the remainder of the starting line
j up, making only two changes in the
! tentative eleven announced in the
| Daily yesterday. Bigelow will be at
j left guard instead of Hulen, while
Milligan has drawn the assignment
| over Marks at center. The complete
| lineup:
Left end —Colvin
Left tackle—Hand
Left guard—Bigelow
Center—Milligan
Right guard—Corhus
Ilight tackle—Ehrhorn
Right end—Tod
Quarterback —Hillman or
Baker
Left half—MoiYatt
Right half—Lambert
Fullback—Allen
As both teams wound up serious
| practice yesterday, it was fairly ap
parent that:
1. Stanford remains a favorite
to win, but by a close score.
2. A spectacular game, with
both teams employing open tac
tics, may be expected.
3. Hillman's illness will de
prive Stanford of a powerful
j plunging back, if he is unable
to play.
4. Lack of reserve strength at
tackles may also handicap the
Indians.
Despite the fact that the Gophers
held Stanford to a scoreless tie last
! year, and are reported much im
proved this year, the Warner eleven
remains a favorite to win. Most
i critics agree, however, that the mar
j gin of victory will be small.
SECRET PRACTICE
With Coach Fritz Crisler drilling
his charges in strict secret over at
Berkeley, his plan of attack is a
matter of conjecture. Indications
are, however, that the Gophers will
I use speed, deception, and a strong
passing attack as much as line play.
Meanwhile it is evident that
Warner intends to "shoot the
works." The presence of Colvin at
left end, rather than the veteran
Neil!, and Ailen at fullback is a cer
| tain indication of an aerial attack.
Colvin is the best pass receiver on
| the squad, while Allen is the best
passer. Tod, at right end, and Mof
fatt and Lambert, halfbacks, are also
l excellent receivers, with MofTatt one
I of the most dangerous men in the
: country once past the line of scrim
i mage.
j The tackle out lateral, one of the
j most tricky plays ever designed by
| Warner, is expected to be seen to
morrow as a part of an open attack
! which Warner has been concentrat
-1 ing on all week.
I There is no question that Hillman
I would be a valuable unit of such a
j plan of attack, with his line smash
ing ability as a constant 'threat to
! keep the defense on the alert. Ba
| ker, however, is a consistent two
yard man, and it will take a power
ful line to keep him under that.
One point of weakness is apparent
■in the line. The huge Ehrhorn is
I expected to prove one of the best
j tackles on the coast before the sea

j out with an injured knee, he is
j without a strong substitute.

STRONG DEFENSE
I Phil Baker, sensation of early sea

j start. Baker is a steady, consistent
j player, lacking the power of Hill
{ man on line smashing, but a tower
|of strength on defense. His per
formance in backing up the line
j against the Olympic Club was one
j of the few features of the game.
Meanwhile Warner has announced
l the remainder of the starting line
j up, making only two changes in the
! tentative eleven announced in the
| Daily yesterday. Bigelow will be at
j left guard instead of Hulen, while
Milligan has drawn the assignment

Left guard—Bigelow

Right guard—Corhus
Ilight tackle—Ehrhorn
Right end—Tod
Quarterback —Hillman or

As both teams wound up serious

parent that:
1. Stanford remains a favorite
to win, but by a close score.
2. A spectacular game, with
both teams employing open tac
tics, may be expected.
3. Hillman's illness will de
prive Stanford of a powerful
j plunging back, if he is unable
to play.
4. Lack of reserve strength at
tackles may also handicap the
Indians.
Despite the fact that the Gophers

remains a favorite to win. Most
