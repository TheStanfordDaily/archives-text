The publication yesterday of the list of junior transfers
and other new men eligible for rushing by fraternities
brings forcibly to mind again the awful plight ot the co-ed
junior transfer where rushing is concerned.
I'niversity ruling holds that all entering lower division
j lien students must spend their first year in Encina, but
grants to upper division entering students the privilege ot
pledging a house if they wish. Not so the Stanford woman.
New women students, entering Stanford in the fall quarter,
who have never been affiliated with a sorority, cannot hold
conversations with sorority women, and must spend their
entire tirst year in Roble. That is the Pan-Hellenic ruling,
reinforced by I'niversity custom.
The superiority of the male has always been a debat
able subject. If it is assumed that junior men know enough
about universities and university life to decide the (pies
lion of whether or not they are going Row, why not make
the same assumption for women of upper division stand
ing?
The deferred rushing plan for freshmen and sophomore
women litis some justification, but the red-tape that en
meshes junior women 011 this campus is enough to make
anybody disgusted. If by any chance a Row woman com
mits the unpardonable sin of speaking to a new woman
oil' Quad, she must make a detailed report of the encounter
to Pan-Hellenic, a procedure that would do credit to the
Loyal Order of Female Moose (or Mooses).
Furthermore, the fact that the junior women transfers
must live their first year in Roble prevents them from
spending more than a year in the sorority house, unless
tliev take graduate work. It is high time that these ridicu
lous barriers were removed, and the women given equal
opportunities with the men.
