Censorship of a college paper is had enough in any
form, hut when the administration stoops to remove finan
cial support, which is merely an underhanded way of pul
ling the paper out of existence, it lias taken a step too far
in an ignoble attempt to restrain a college editor for an
article that did not even pertain to the administration.
There are other milder ways in which a campus paper
can he curbed, if university otlieials feel, for no good rea
son, that censorship is required of them; hut for a group
of educators, often ignorant of the standards and meaning
of campus journalism, to threaten a paper with extinction
because it ran what they considered a sensational story is
an inexcusable misuse of power.
Perhaps the administrators of Michigan University did
not actually intend to destroy the college paper but merely
sought bv such threats to make the editor comply with
their editorial fancies. Whether action was actually in
tended or not, such a cowardly method of censorship,
never desirable in any form, as shutting oil' the funds
merits only condemnation.
