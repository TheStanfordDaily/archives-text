# A 						CHANGE NEEDED

(Reprinted from the Oregon Stale Barometer)
"Oregon State sororities are far ahead of most groups |
throughout the country with their system of closed rush- j
nig." Such is the opinion of one whose experience with
rushing on this campus and others gives a respect to her j
ideas on pledging. The local Pan-Hellenic Council has fori
some four or five years followed the recommendation of
the national organization, really being a pioneer in the
attempt to do away with the unpleasant results of sorority
rushing.
Then came the suggestion that fraternities might im
prove their system in a similar manner doing away with
the cut-throat tactics so obviously employed at the present!
tune. Limiting the number of dates with each house and
also the number of fraternities with which dates could be;
accepted might be adopted from sororities. The practice
of allowing freshmen to live in houses freshman week
gives the host the advantage in that they become better j
acquainted, but with the present dormitory facilities any
other scheme would he impossible. Stanford can and does
make freshmen live at halls with pledging delayed until
spring term and with a limit on dates.
The chances for a change on this campus arc therefore j
qualified by existing conditions. Any new system would
come through action of the interfraternitv council and it
seems a worthy object for their consideration. There must
be a way out, an end to high-power salesmanship behind
locked doors. Let the rushee pick the fraternity rather
than permitting the fraternity to make the decision for him.
