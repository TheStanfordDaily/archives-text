# BULL SESSION
## REPUBLICANS STAR IN DEPRESSION FARCE 
### 
Everybody thought that once it
had been proven that the Repub
lican party and prosperity are not
inseparable bed-mates, that the
G.O.P. would give up the ghost and
let the Democrats have a try at
i itting in the saddle. It has been so
i long since the Democrats have been
that far off the ground, that many
feared the high altitude would have
j disastrous physical effects.
Be that as it may, the Democrats
have a depression to talk about and
the Republicans have a depression
I to talk away; and from some indi
| cations it looks like the Republicans
I will be more successful. The Bour
bons had always felt that if once
j hard-times fell to a G.O.P. president,
j it would be accepted that they
; would have the privilege to point
the fact out to the It seemed
i fair that if the Republicans were al
i lowed to get excited about a "full
dinner pail—silk stockings—and cars
for everybody," that their opponents
j had equal right to ballyhoo i-bout
! the empty pail ,bare legs, and flat
! tires.
But now comcs Robert Lucas, the
; big efficiency expert at the head of
the Republican party, with the cry
that this depression is being ac
centuated and magnified out of all
j proportions by the cries of the
J Democrats. The poor sons of Jef
ferson are being blamed for the de
-1 pression even when they are not in
. oli ice! It seems that Democratic
j presidents have had a depression so
1 consistently, that it might be a good
Spanish custom to make the Demo
cratic Party — Royal-Take-All
i BJame-for-Depressions (in office or
out).
It seems spoor sportsmanship on
Mr. Lucas' part to rail at the Demo

! crats for something they learned
from the Republicans. It was Mark
Hanna who taught the value of
painting "$" signs on the ballot
boxes and singing sweet hymns to
! prosperity; and now the Democrats
j —who couldn't win an election un
l less it was given to them, have
; finally learned the enemy signals,
J mastered th-iir plays—and now plan
j to score heavily with them in the
' Big Game—November 1932.
But while Mr. Lucas is blaming
the depression on the Democrats,
i Senator Fess is attempting to prove
; that a depression is a pretty good
; thing. When appointed national Re
-1 publican chairman, it was claimed
' that Fess would do the talking and
| Lucas would do the thinking for
! both men; but it'appears that. Fess
i seems to be thinking for himself—
i which is always a handicap for the
| Republicans.
Fess, Senator from Ohio, claims
I that depression often serves to make
| new wealth; and as new wealth is
i what we want, the logic would be
' to get more depressions—bigger and
j better ones too. Not if Lucas blames
the depression on the Democrats,
J and Fess shows how valuable a de
j pression is, why it seems that the
! two great Republicans have con
i clusively proved that the Democrats
| should win in '32.
This is beginning to look like a
j comic opera plot; where at the last
! curtain, the dead awake, the vil
i lains die, the heroes and heroines
i kiss, and everybody is happy. May-
I be the Republicans have been fool
| ing everybody and really love their
| little playmates on the other side of
the house—and on the other side of
| c verything clss too. Who knows?
