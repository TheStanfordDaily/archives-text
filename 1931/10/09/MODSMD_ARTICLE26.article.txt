POST MORTEM—By Noel Coward. |
Doublcday Doran. 1931. (At the j
Magazine Shop.)
Noel Coward, having authored
such charming idiocies as Private j
Lives and Home Chat has, it would !
seem, set out to prove himself ca- j
pable of things more serious, mem- !
ory of his Vortex being now only
faint.
Post Mortem is bitter; its charac
ters smug Babbitts, self-satisfied,
rutted like so many noisy pigs, each
attempting to outsqueal the others, j
The interludes at London tea tables j
have an eerie, rather unpleasing air. I
The play will certainly arouse j
critical comparison although prob- j
ably not critical halooings; Noel has
been far too entertaining in the ,
drawing room to be lost in a mere
attack on civilization. —J. S. S.
S. S. SAN PEDRO—By James Could
Cozzens. New York. Harcnurt,
Brace & Co. 1931.
This small but highly advertised !
volume hardly comes up to expecta- j
lions. The author knows his subject t
thoroughly and the idea of the book
is good, but is poorly written and
in some spots very vague.
The S.S. San Pedro, a medium- ]
sized passenger liner, sets sail from j

' New York with an assorted cargo
; and a still more assorted crew. The
I book tells in a very matter-of-fact
fashion how a list develops disaster
| when a storm arises.
The description of the battering
!of the ship by the sea until one
! part after another gives way and
the boat finally capsizes, is good in
spots, but so mixed up that thc
reader gets only a very hazy im
j pression of what is happening. At
I the end all we know is that the San
J Pedro has capsized, but we do not
I know the fate of the passengers or
I crew.
; But we do get a very graphic pic
j lure of the captain and the second
j officer and the book shows the flaw
, in the system of command. In the
I time of crisis all authority centers
around Captain Clendening, who
collapses under the strain. Since he
is still on the bridge giving orders
no one else can command and the
j officers and crew are almost help-
I less in the face of disaster.
The book would be better if the
1 author had paid more attention to
style and had set his characters
apart more. The whole story is told
without allowing the reader to catch
I any of the excitement, yet it holds
1 interest fairly well. —R. M.

ory of his Vortex being now only

Post Mortem is bitter; its charac
ters smug Babbitts, self-satisfied,
rutted like so many noisy pigs, each

The interludes at London tea tables j

The play will certainly arouse j
critical comparison although prob- j

S. S. SAN PEDRO—By James Could
Cozzens. New York. Harcnurt,
Brace & Co. 1931.
This small but highly advertised !
volume hardly comes up to expecta- j
lions. The author knows his subject t
thoroughly and the idea of the book
is good, but is poorly written and
in some spots very vague.
The S.S. San Pedro, a medium- ]
sized passenger liner, sets sail from j

' New York with an assorted cargo
; and a still more assorted crew. The
I book tells in a very matter-of-fact
fashion how a list develops disaster
| when a storm arises.
The description of the battering
!of the ship by the sea until one
! part after another gives way and
the boat finally capsizes, is good in
spots, but so mixed up that thc
reader gets only a very hazy im
j pression of what is happening. At
I the end all we know is that the San
J Pedro has capsized, but we do not
I know the fate of the passengers or
I crew.
; But we do get a very graphic pic
j lure of the captain and the second
j officer and the book shows the flaw
, in the system of command. In the
I time of crisis all authority centers
around Captain Clendening, who
collapses under the strain. Since he
is still on the bridge giving orders
no one else can command and the
j officers and crew are almost help-
I less in the face of disaster.
The book would be better if the
1 author had paid more attention to
style and had set his characters
apart more. The whole story is told
without allowing the reader to catch
I any of the excitement, yet it holds
1 interest fairly well. —R. M.
