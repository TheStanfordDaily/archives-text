## THE 						UNION REPLIES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Cellar is one of the student
enterprises grouped under the Union i
Board of Control along with the J
Stanford Union, the Encina Store, !
etc. It is financed by the permanent |
student organization (A.S.S.U.) j
v/hich, although permanent in char- :
ter, is fluctuating in personnel. But j
the fact, let us speak specifically j
now, that the Cellar is a student
enterprise does not make it immune
to the precepts of good management
nor of the effects of general trade
conditions. One thing is mandatory,
we must suffer no unnecessary loss
in any department on any item of
the enterprise.
Coffee costs three cents per cup;
this cost has been determined by '
hotel systems and our own ex
perience. An additional percentage
for labor and a fair allowance for
breakage must be added. Now,
where do we stand? At five cents a '
cup we have the commodity and I
service, but no reasonable margin j
of profit. Place yourself as stock- j
holder or director of the Cellar, as !
in actuality you are—and consider, j
Is it wise to sell coffee a la carte for :
five cents a cup?
Further, we have had five-cent j
coffee with all orders over ten cents j
WARSAW, Poland, Oct. 8 (J?).— j
The government has tapped a new
source of revenue. A tax of one- j
fifth to two per cent is to be levied ;
upon the incomes of all men not in |
the army.

[ for one year and there are but com
| paratively few who wish but a single
I cup of coffee. A ten cent cup of
J coffee entitles one to a refill.
Sincerely yours,
Jerry Wood
Student representative
Union Board of Control
