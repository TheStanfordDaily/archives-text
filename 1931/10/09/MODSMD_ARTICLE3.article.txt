# CALIFORNIA CO-ED ASSERTS PARENTS HEAVIER DRINKERS
## 
### 
Youth challenged its elders
when a co-cd faced a group
of campus mothers and told
them emphatically that re
sponsibility for student drink
ing rests upon the parents.
That climaxed a meeting of
the Pan-Hellenic Mothers
Club, held in the Senior Wom
en's Hall on the California
campus.
The girl. Miss Barbara-Lou
White, vice-president of the
Associated Students, says:
"The parents arc responsible
for training their children be
fore they come to college, and
it isn't up to the student body
to try to remake them after
they come here, if they were
not trained properly at home.
'At the celebrations follow
ing the Big (tame each year, it
isn't the students who are dis
gustingly drunkâ€”it is the old
er people, the parents, who
make spectacles of themselves."
