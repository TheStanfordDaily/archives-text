# The 						WINDJAMMER

This business of ignoring glaring 1
j news items has gone on long enough, j
j Once more the business depression
| comes into the headlines with the
! Betas cutting expenses on lawn- j
j mowing by the installation of a |
j young, four-footed tin-can enthu- I
j siast, that bleats at any hour of the j
] day or night but wreaks havoc on 1
\ stray dandelions.
The boys feed him anything
that comes in bottled form—
making the kid the goat, you ;
see.
Somehow, the sight of that work- \
j man eternally chipping away on I
i the gates to Palm Drive is getting i
familiar, so that it's part of home j
life at the Farm, like the Stadium :
and the shiny-black-Packard twins
on the Pi Phi sidewalk. Windjammer
| proposes an endowment for the per- '
| manent maintenance of a blockade j
:at the highway intersection. How ;
I about it, alumni?

We know now that the foot
ball season is actually under
way, what with the annual
Daily-Chappie clash coming off
tomorrow, between halves of
the Minnesota fray. The Chappie
i editor bribed us to tell you that
he has far and above the better
! team, but there is that little j
I

thing called loyalty—besides,
we've secretly and deviously
discovered that one go-get-'em
sorority group is furnishing cos
tumes for the Daily crew, so
you're left to form your own
unbiased, opinions.
Tonight the good old Varsity i
| theatre will open again, to provide
! fodder for collegiate mental masti- j
| cation. Some people have been i
j practically forced to study, this ;
week, because there wasn't room ■
! for them at the Stanford. For awhile :
; plans for a third Paly theatre were j
! being considered, but that's been !
i dropped, too.
'S too bad they couldn't have
I put the thing up where the DU
house stands. The 1)1' pool
(you've heard of the DU pool,
of course?) would make such a ;
lovely bright spot in a lobby.
j In passing, mention should be
j made of the dear old Fij is, who seem
I finally to be coming back into their
! own, with two pseudo-satellites
; messing up the gridiron every Sat
urday afternoon. May bo the boys
are kind of slow—but—well, Cal
Coolidge is one of Ihe brothers, you
know—the kind that simply does
not choose to run. (Editor's note:
j Old gag, but passable.)
