### 
HAWTHORNE R ACE TRACK,
CHICAGO, Oct. 8 (A 3 ) — Old Sun
1 Beau wrapped $20,000 more around
his record-breaking bankroll today
I and called it quits.
The Beau of Binghamton, for the
| third consecutive year, won the
$25,000 Hawthorne gold cup by a
length and a half from Mate, and
! stretched his total winnings to $370,-
744 in five years of campaigning.
( Now the green and orange colors
, of Willis Sharpe Kilmer, which Sun
| Beau carried to victory 33 times in
■ 74 starts, will be hung in the stable.
' Never again will Sun Beau's hoofs
: pound a race course. He will be
! placed in retirement.
Sun Beau, greatest money-win
j ning Thoroughbred in the world,
I duplicated the performance of Ex
terminator in winning the same
! stake race three times running, in
j capturing the Hawthorne classic.
Not since Exterminator, which was
also owned by Mr. Kilmer, won the
Saratoga gold cup in 1919, 1920, and
1921 has any American Thorough
bred won the same stake race three
times in a row. Sun Beau won the
Hawthorne gold cup in 1929 and
1930.
