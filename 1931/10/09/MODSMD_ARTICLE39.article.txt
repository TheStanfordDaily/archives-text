FEDERAL BUILDING, CHICA- j
GO, Oct. 8 (/P>.â€”Al Capone's un
usual system of high finance, the
division of profits in his underworld i
organization, and an attempt by the '
gang leader to settle his income tax '
affairs with the government, were
discussed today at his trial in Fed
eral court on charges of income tax
evasion.
The day's most important dcvel- j
opment was regarded as a victory
for District Attorney George E. Q.
Johnson and his legal staff, who are !
attempting to convict Capone or.
double - barrelled charges which |
would put him behind prison bars j
for a maximum sentence of thirty- i
two years and extract $80,000 from
him in fines.
The evidence is intended to show i

j Capone admitted that he had an
income of $266,000 over four years
from the profits of Chicago's liquor,
gambling, and vice enterprises.
Capone, dressed in garments more
somber since reporters twitted him
about a flashy necktie and bright
colored socks, lost his look of bore
dom when Judge Wilkerson ruled
the evidence admissible. The scar
faced gang chief glared at his attor
neys, Michael Ahern and Albert
Fink, toward whom he normally is
most affable.
"Mr. Capone arrived a few min
utes late, accompanied by two men
who remained on sentry duty at the
door," Wilson testified. "Mr. Mat
tingly told me that Capone's in
come was $26,000 in 1926, $40,000 in
1927, $100,000 in 1928, and $100,000
in 1929."
