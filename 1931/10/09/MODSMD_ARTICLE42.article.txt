# MENTAL FRAILTIES TO BE CONSIDERED AS 'ACCIDENT GERM'
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 8 (/P).â€”Medical
science has joined the nation's pro
fessional exponents of safety in a
search for the "accident germ."
Because safety men arc convinced
that the most dangerous machine to
day is the human machine, mental
aspects of safety will be emphasized
at the twentieth annual Safety Con
gress and Exposition in Chicago Oc
tober 12 to 16.
The basic causes of probably 90
per cent of all accidents, safety men
contend, lurk in the human mind.
Leaders in medical research and
psychiatry will offer their explana
tions of human frailties most com
monly responsible for accidents.
Virtually every known field of
hazard will be diagnosed as to cause
and effect when 7000 safety men
gather to hear more than 350 speak
ers at the Chicago congress.
Leading causative factors in ac
cidents, such as worry, day-dream
ing, fatigue, indifference, over-con
fidence, and faulty reaction to me
chanical processes will be subjected
to medical and psychiatric analysis.
