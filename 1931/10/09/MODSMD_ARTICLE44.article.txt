The unpardonable sin for the
college sports writer is to pre
dict confidently that his team
will win without qualifying that
prediction via the "after a hard
fought battle" or "by a small
margin route.'" Nevertheless, this
scrivener takes this opportunity
to get his neck out in a vulner
able position thus: Stanford will
whip Minnesota tomorrow —DE-
CISIVELY.

Minnesota apparently should nev
er have tied the Indians last year.
This year the Gophers are an im
proved team, but so is Stanford, and
the answer should be around three
or four touchdowns to none or one.
0.K., if we're very far wrong, we'll
write no more columns, and you
can lay to that.
Stanford is apparently going
places this year, and the Gopher
fray is going to be a good place
to star. Man for man. the In
dians are stronger at the tackles
and guards than they were last
year, at least as strong, if not
more powerful, at the ends and
no weaker at center. Backs arc
more numerous and just as ver
satile.
Minnesota, pressed by North Da
kota Aggies and victorious over
Ripon and Oklahoma A. and M., has
no record to blow off about. The
first two are push-overs of the first
rank, and Oklahoma A. and M., even
at its best, is hardly more than a
run-of-the-mill eleven.
On the other hand, Stanford
has not set the world afire, but
in the Olympic Club and
Santa Clara, it has faced a
couple of rattling good ball
clubs. Therefore, the under
signed, with absolutely no out
side aid, has arrived at the con
clusion outlined above.
Of course, the Stanford team may
take it upon itself to make a liar
out of the writer. But in that event,
ihe latter disclaims any responsi
bility for money wagered on the
outcome. Stanford can and should
hand the Gophers a merry trounc
ing. But then lot:; of people thought
the same thing last year, and look
what happened!
At this stage of the proceed
ings, we would guess (1) the
Stanford line will hold Manders,
the Gopher fullback, to a negli
gible amount of yardage (2) if
Captain Munn's kicks outdis
tance his ends again, Phil Mof
fatt will break away on a punt
return, (3) Ernie Caddel will
surprise somebody with his
work at right half, (4) McDou
gall, the Minnesota half - pint
quarterback, will reel off a few
long runs, (5) someone will defi
nitely be named to the first
string center post after the
game.

Of course, the Stanford team may
take it upon itself to make a liar
out of the writer. But in that event,
ihe latter disclaims any responsi
bility for money wagered on the
outcome. Stanford can and should
hand the Gophers a merry trounc
ing. But then lot:; of people thought
the same thing last year, and look
what happened!
At this stage of the proceed
ings, we would guess (1) the
Stanford line will hold Manders,
the Gopher fullback, to a negli
gible amount of yardage (2) if
Captain Munn's kicks outdis
tance his ends again, Phil Mof
fatt will break away on a punt
return, (3) Ernie Caddel will
surprise somebody with his
work at right half, (4) McDou
gall, the Minnesota half - pint
quarterback, will reel off a few
long runs, (5) someone will defi
nitely be named to the first
string center post after the
game.

The unpardonable sin for the
college sports writer is to pre
dict confidently that his team
will win without qualifying that
prediction via the "after a hard
fought battle" or "by a small
margin route.'" Nevertheless, this
scrivener takes this opportunity
to get his neck out in a vulner
able position thus: Stanford will
whip Minnesota tomorrow —DE-
CISIVELY.

Minnesota apparently should nev
er have tied the Indians last year.
This year the Gophers are an im
proved team, but so is Stanford, and
the answer should be around three
or four touchdowns to none or one.
0.K., if we're very far wrong, we'll
write no more columns, and you
can lay to that.
Stanford is apparently going
places this year, and the Gopher
fray is going to be a good place
to star. Man for man. the In
dians are stronger at the tackles
and guards than they were last
year, at least as strong, if not
more powerful, at the ends and
no weaker at center. Backs arc
more numerous and just as ver
satile.
Minnesota, pressed by North Da
kota Aggies and victorious over
Ripon and Oklahoma A. and M., has
no record to blow off about. The
first two are push-overs of the first
rank, and Oklahoma A. and M., even
at its best, is hardly more than a
run-of-the-mill eleven.
On the other hand, Stanford
has not set the world afire, but
in the Olympic Club and
Santa Clara, it has faced a
couple of rattling good ball
clubs. Therefore, the under
signed, with absolutely no out
side aid, has arrived at the con
clusion outlined above.
Of course, the Stanford team may
take it upon itself to make a liar
out of the writer. But in that event,
ihe latter disclaims any responsi
bility for money wagered on the
outcome. Stanford can and should
