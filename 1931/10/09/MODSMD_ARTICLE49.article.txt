# Indian Frosh Clash With Bruin Cubs Tomorrow
## TWO UNTRIED MEN WILL SEE ACTION AGAINST INVADERS Abrahamson And Bates To Replace Injured Men; Rothert May Start 
### 
Two untried men in the line-up
will mark the apeparance of the j
Stanford babe grid team against j
U.C.L.A. freshmen in tomorrow's I
preliminary to the Stanford-Minne- i
sota game. The yearling clash will I
begin at 12 o'clock.
Abrahamson and Bates are the ,
new men. Abrahamson will assume i
Durkee's duties at left end. The j
blond-haired Durkee received three
broken fingers and a broken nose |
in last Saturday's fray and will be
out of action for some time.
Van Kirk Out
Van Kirk, who had a field day '
scrambling up plays in the Los An- j
geles backfield last week, has sud- j
denly developed injuries that: may j
keep hmi on the bench for a couple j
of Saturdays. Bates replaces him at
the center position.
The important post of left half of- i
fers Coach Jimmy Bradshaw his I
najor week-end problem. Bowles, j
first-choice man for the job, has ;
been out with a twisted neck and j
his very capable understudy Ro
thert has undergone a foot opera- ;
.ion. At present Rothert stands I
scheduled to start the game with
Trompas on deck in the event he j
s not able.
Cook for Semmelroth 1
The remainder of the team is sim- j
ilar to last week's starting crew j
with the exception of Cook at guard.
Moore is at right half, Flannagan ai I
I quarter, and Seaver in the fullback
position. Kahn is in at left end;
| Keller and Letunich, tackles; Mot
' tram and Cook, guards. Cook re
i places the injured Semmelroth at
: right guard.
! Stress this week in practice has
, been laid on defensive work. That
; giant Westwoocl line may prove difâ€”
! ficult to make yardage through, so
! Moore is working hard to add dis
i tance to his punts. The rugged half
i back put on a beautiful exhibition
| of punting out near the opponents'
j goal line last Saturday but his kicks
! were a trifle short on occasions.
Seaver is displaying a more pow
i erful drive every practice period
and is proving himself a real offen
j sive threat through the center of
| the line. This big boy is likely to
i make quite a name for himself be
| fore he hangs up the football cleats
for keeps.
