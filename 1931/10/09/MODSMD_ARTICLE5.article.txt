# MINNESOTA FRACAS TOSS-UPâ€”WARNER; HISTORY REVIEWED
## 
### 
! The Minnesota game tomorrow
| "will be a hard-fought game from
( start to finish and just about a toss
up as to who will come out on the
long end of the score" declared
Coach Glenn S. "Pop" Warner last
night, speaking through KFRC over
the Columbia Broadcasting System.
In explaining his reasons for mak-
I ing such a statement, the Stanford j
mentor pointed out that his squads
had met supposedly weak Minnesota
1 teams twice, once in 1908 and again
I in 1930, and that each time the Go
phers had pulled through to out- i
i fight their heavily favored oppo
nents. Warner also showed that i
while Stanford has not as yet shown j
j any noticeable improvement over j
last season, the Minnesota aggrega- i
; tion is acknowledged to be a much j
j better team than a year ago.
1 In commenting on other contests
| to be held this Saturday, Warner
! expressed the opinion that the Ore- i
gon-Washington result would prob- j
, ably decide the Northwestern cham
pionship. He also picked Southern |
California as an easy favorite over
Washington State.
Regarding the Olympic Club-Cali- j
| fornia clash in Berkeley, he said that!
if the Club played as it did against
; the Big Red Machine the Bears I
j should be defeated without much
i difficulty.
