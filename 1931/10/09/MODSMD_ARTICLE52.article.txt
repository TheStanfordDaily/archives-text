## 
### 
Tennis has begun in earnest for
| the quarter now that the ranking
j list has been posted. Ladder matches
| are to be played throughout autumn
quarter and the first eight rankers
at the end of this time are to be
placed on the varsity squad. Fresh
men have no squad as yet, but only
i a ranking ladder. Players are re
quired to settle at least one match
a week to keep things moving.
Following is the varsity squad as
jit stands at present: (1) Joe Cough
lin, (2) Bob Forbes, (3) Kelsey Pet
terson, (4) Hubert Butler, (5)
Charles Otis, (6) George Forney,
(7) Monte Shwayder, (8) Dan Ellis,
(9) Bob Rhodes, (10) John Gordon,
(11) Glen Reed, (12) Lawrence Wal
lace, (13) Charles Dodge, (14) A1

Ladder Constructed
From here the ladder commences,
the first permanent eight men to be
placed on the varsity squad at the

! end of the quarter. The first ten are:
(1) Robert Piercy, (2) Douglas
Smith, (3) Winston Strong, (4) Rob
i ert Coles, (5) Charles Atterbury,
(6) Alex Young, (7) Frank Bernes,
I (8) Havrah Bell, (9) Robert Moore,
(10) Robert Raven.
Freshmen are, of course, very un
stable as to their rankings, but the
quarter's play should bring the best
to the top and show the true strength
of the babes. Following is the fresh
man ladder, as far as the first ten,
in its present form: (1) Sam Lee,
! (2) Robert Lilienthal, (3) Don Nel

Gledhill Absent
Perhaps some wonder why Keith
Gledhill is not at the top of the
J varsity squad list. His absence will
i not continue long, as he left fo.r
Santa Barbara Tuesday, to return
1 winter quarter for registration.
When he does return, there will not
| be much doubt as to the ownership
; of first place, since he has held this
j position for the major part of all his
I three years of varsity competition.

Ladder Constructed
From here the ladder commences,
the first permanent eight men to be
placed on the varsity squad at the

! end of the quarter. The first ten are:
(1) Robert Piercy, (2) Douglas
Smith, (3) Winston Strong, (4) Rob
i ert Coles, (5) Charles Atterbury,
(6) Alex Young, (7) Frank Bernes,
I (8) Havrah Bell, (9) Robert Moore,
(10) Robert Raven.
Freshmen are, of course, very un
stable as to their rankings, but the
quarter's play should bring the best
to the top and show the true strength
of the babes. Following is the fresh
man ladder, as far as the first ten,
in its present form: (1) Sam Lee,
! (2) Robert Lilienthal, (3) Don Nel
son, (4) Herman Dreyer, (5) Pierre
; Zucco, (6) Hugh Moran, (7) Ran
dolph Hill, (8) Ray Jadarola, (9)
John Huston, (10) Ben Holt.
Gledhill Absent
Perhaps some wonder why Keith
Gledhill is not at the top of the
J varsity squad list. His absence will
i not continue long, as he left fo.r
Santa Barbara Tuesday, to return
1 winter quarter for registration.
When he does return, there will not
| be much doubt as to the ownership
; of first place, since he has held this
j position for the major part of all his
I three years of varsity competition.
Tennis has begun in earnest for
| the quarter now that the ranking
j list has been posted. Ladder matches
| are to be played throughout autumn
quarter and the first eight rankers
at the end of this time are to be
placed on the varsity squad. Fresh
men have no squad as yet, but only
i a ranking ladder. Players are re
quired to settle at least one match
a week to keep things moving.
Following is the varsity squad as
jit stands at present: (1) Joe Cough
