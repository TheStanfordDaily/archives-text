# STANFORD CENTER OF PACIFIC COAST GRIDIRON INTEREST
## Trojans Will Tangle With Conference Champs; U.C. Meets Olympic Club 
### Dick Rodda 
| While the Stanford-Minnesota
' contest holds the Pacific Coast foot-
I ball spotlight tomorrow, several im
; portant contests will be watched
with an almost equal interest, par
| ticularly the U.S.C.-Washington
| State game at Los Angeles.
j The Washington State Cougars, it I
will be remembered, upset the dope j
i last year by defeating the Trojans j
; 7 to G. after trouncing the California i
' Bears the week before. And the j
i Cougar coach, Jimmy Hollingherry, j
I is set on repeating this year.
Trfljans Meet W.S.C.
But his task will be much more
; difficult than last year, as the Tro
! Jans are already smarting from an
I early season defeat by St. Mary's, j
! Consequently, Howard Jones will j
i be especially prepared to stop the
I Cougars. Three brand new plays
i have been perfected this week to be
I tried on the Cougars, and a stronger
; pass defense has been developed.
California's opponent this wee k is j
I the powerful Olympic Club squad
that two weeks ago' held Stanford
to a scoreless tie. Despite several in
| juries among the Club players, they
| are slight favorites to win.
Club Tests Bears
j Bill Ingram will depart from Nibs
Price's policy of giving his second- I
, and third-string men a little prac- |
I tice against the l 'Winged-0," plan- |
i ning to send his best eleven on the
' field. The Club defeated the Bears
13 to 6 last jenr. j
This contest will be of interest to '
Stanford followers in that it will
throw further light upon the re
spective strengths of the Indians and
the Bears. The showing of Stanford
and California against Santa Clara
i would indicate that the Cards are
! slightly stronger, but a victory by
the Bears tomorrow would contra
dict this, as the Cards were out
played by the Clubmen two weeks (

Other conference games tomorrow j
are the Washington-Oregon game 1

I is set on repeating this year.
Trfljans Meet W.S.C.
But his task will be much more
; difficult than last year, as the Tro
! Jans are already smarting from an
I early season defeat by St. Mary's, j
! Consequently, Howard Jones will j
i be especially prepared to stop the
I Cougars. Three brand new plays
i have been perfected this week to be
I tried on the Cougars, and a stronger
; pass defense has been developed.
California's opponent this wee k is j
I the powerful Olympic Club squad
that two weeks ago' held Stanford
to a scoreless tie. Despite several in
| juries among the Club players, they
| are slight favorites to win.
Club Tests Bears
j Bill Ingram will depart from Nibs
Price's policy of giving his second- I
, and third-string men a little prac- |
I tice against the l 'Winged-0," plan- |
i ning to send his best eleven on the
' field. The Club defeated the Bears
13 to 6 last jenr. j
This contest will be of interest to '
Stanford followers in that it will
throw further light upon the re
spective strengths of the Indians and
the Bears. The showing of Stanford
and California against Santa Clara
i would indicate that the Cards are
! slightly stronger, but a victory by
the Bears tomorrow would contra
dict this, as the Cards were out
played by the Clubmen two weeks (
: ago. i
Other conference games tomorrow j
are the Washington-Oregon game 1
at Seattle arid the Idaho-Montana .
game at Moscow, Idaho. U.C.L.A. i
| and Oregon State have no scheduled !
i games this week.
