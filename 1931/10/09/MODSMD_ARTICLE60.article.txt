# CARDINALS RECEIVE JOYFUL WELCOME FROM HOME TOWN
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 8. (/P)—Another
"we"—"Pepper" Martin and the St.
Louis Cardinals—came home today
to a heroic welcome as the "Spirit
of St. Louis" once more rode high
along the banks of the Mississippi.
At least 2,000 of the most rabid
faithful stormed the railroad ter
minal, shouting, mauling, surging in
to get their hands on the simple
youngster who almost single-handed
has routed the world champion
Philadelphia Athletics to give the
Cardinals a 3 to 2 lead in games
and lift a National League cham
pion to within one game of the first
World Series conquest for that cir
cuit in five years.
They will see him tomorrow, these
riotous rooters, eagerly taking his
cut against the sweeping slants o£
"Big Jarge" Earnshaw in the sixth
game at Sportsman's Park, opening
of the final act of one of the most
thrilling baseball dramas of all
times.
