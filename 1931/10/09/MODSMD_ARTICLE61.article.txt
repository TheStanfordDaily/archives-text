### 
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 8 (TP).â€” j
The St. Paul Saints strung out the j
i Little World Series for at least one j
i more day when they defeated the j
i Rochester Red Wings 9 to 5 here;
i today in the seventh game.
The visiting club, champions of'
| the American Association, advanced i
i to within one game of their Inter- |
; national League rivals by the win.
! Rochester still leads, 4 to 3. Five
' games are necessary to win the
| series.
Today's contest, played before a
! crowd of 1(328, because of frigid
' weather and clouded skies, was vir
\ tually a repetition of yesterday's St.
j Paul victory. Every man on the vis
: iting team got at least one hit. Saltz
; gaver, Saints' second baseman, led
j with three safe blows.
