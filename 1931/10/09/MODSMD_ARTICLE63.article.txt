# Indian Soccer Team Meets S.F.U. Today
## Marks First Game of Season for Opposing Teams; Sophomore May Star at Center for Cards 
### BY FRANK LLOYD 
Meeting an untried, but reputedly j
strong S.F.U. soccer team at 4 ;
| o'clock this afternoon on the local
field, the Stanford hoofers will open j
the soccer season on the Farm.
Confidence is expressed by Harry
Muloney in ihe Redshirts' ability ,
j to give a good account of themselves
! in today's game. During the past j
week practice sessions have re- j
vealed the Indian varsity has shown j
a very decided scoring punch.
Halfbacks Strong
i The halfbacks, Prec Plumb, Ed
i Hayes, and Jim Moore, who aie all
j essential in feeding the ball to the '
I forwards for scoring opportunities, \
I are one of the strongest trio that
1 have played for Maloney in many |
| years.
Although little can be judged
: about the Gray Fog's power, due
j to the fact that this is also their j
! first game of the year, a large turn- j
I out for the sport and a great deal '
| of enthusiasm may count for a good i
| deal in the effectiveness of the out- !
fit.
Power Shown by Fulls
1 Judging by the tremendous clouts j
! that, both Buster Holmes and Dutch
Brekelbaum were getting off in
! practice yesterday, the defensive !
J part of the Indian varsity can be j
i expected to furnish a lot of punch.
! Both Holmes and Brekelbaum
I kick with either foot and are of the
! fast hard charging type of player
i who is likely to break up even the
i best-planned attack on the part of
! the opposing forwards.
Webster at Goal
The goal, where the fate of every
! team is decided, will be taken care
1 of by Jim Webster, who has been
| doing some very creditable work
• during the week's practice. Webster
| specializes in a quick and accurate
: getaway of all his stops behind the
i throwing of his good right arm.
| An unusually strong forward wall
j is presented with Bill Mearns and
Bill Beggs on the wings, Captain
Karl Falk and Larry Washburn at
inside, and Art Hearn at center.
Hearn a Star
Don't be surprised if that young
i second-year man, Art Hearn, steals
| the show from his veteran team
mates. Hearn is one of the most
j accurate kickers on the squad, as j

! well as being a wizard on dribbling
I up the field through his opponents.
There is bound to be plenty of
i action wherever Ed Hayes, the
Cardinal center half, finds himself
I 011 the Hold. Hayes has a power of
j anticipating the move of the oppos
• ing players in a way that appears
| distinctly uncanny.
