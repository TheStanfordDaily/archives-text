Minnesota's husky Gophers tackle Stanford at Palo Alto October
10 in one of the outstanding intersectional games of the season. Eoth
teams have a brilliant array of backs who will attempt to avoid a repe
tition of the 0-0 battle of last year. In Phil Moffatt, coast observers
say, Stanford has probably the most versatile backfield man in the
west. My Ãœbl, triple threat man, and Jack Manders, plunging fullback,
are the big guns of the Gophers.
