# DOLE CHAMPIONED BY LABOR LEADERS
## 
### 
VANCOUVER, 8.C., Oct. 8 (/Pi-
Tired of hearing speaker after
speaker heap denunciation on the
dole system, British fraternal dele
gates to the fifty-first annual con
vention of the American Federation
of Labor issued a fiery reply to their
critics today.
Declaring that those who assert
the dole has destroyed the ambition
and initiative of the British worker
are uttering a "malicious lie," F.
Wolstencroft, representing the Brit
ish Wood Workers, and J. Beard of
the British Transport Workers' Un
ion challenged the United States to
show that it had dealt more intelli
gently with its unemployment prob
lem.
