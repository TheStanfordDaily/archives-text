# BIG GAME BONFIRE NOT TO CONSUME CONDEMNED TREES
## Better Use For Firewood Is Available Says Almon E. Roth 
### 
Tentative plans for the biggest Big 1
Game bonfire ever went up in smoke ;
yesterday when Comptroller Almon :
E. Roth definitely stated that with
things the way they were the Uni- j
versity could better dispose of hun- j
dreds of dead and dying pine trees j
than by letting them go in one blaze j
of glory.
Confirming Dr. Henry E. Burke, |
senior entomologist of the U.S. De
partment of Agriculture, in the hit
ter's statement that drought and the ■
ravages of Dendroctonus Valens had i
put the death blow on many of the
fine native Monterey pine and I
spruce on the campus, Comptroller
Roth added that the damage done
had reached immense proportions.
The only way to save the trees
about the campus, Comptroller Roth
agreed with Dr. Burke, would be j
to have the dead ones cut down be
fore they spread infection.
But the Big Game bonfire, he j
declared, would not benefit by the j
wholesale felling of pines soon to j
begin. The University, he said, j
would be severely criticized if the j
freshmen were allowed to cut the
infected trees down even after Dr. !
Burke had picked them out, for use i
in the big blaze before the Cal-Card
football game, especially while there j
were men out of work and people to j
sell pine firewood to.
Let the freshmen keep on building 1
a Big Game blaze out of boxes and 1
barrels, Roth suggested.
