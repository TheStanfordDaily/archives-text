# NEW JOURNALISM INSTRUCTOR PRAISES INDEPENDENCE OF "DAILY" MANAGEMENT
## 
### 
Declaring that the Stanford Daily !
is one ol the few outstanding col- ]
, lego dailies in the country, Charles :
| E. Rogers, one of the two new men ;
j on the journalism faculty, stressed !
1 his approval of the campus publica- |
tion when interviewed yesterday.
"I am particularly impressed with :
! the lack of faculty supervision. On j
most mid-western and eastern col- |
! lege papers a professor is head copy j
1 reader and chief censor for the ad- j
j ministration.
1 "I find that the system of passing
officers on from year to year by j
' vote of the out-going officers is far j
superior to the eastern method of
faculty appointment.
"Your inclusion of a subscription j
to the paper in the tuition is en- j

tirely fiew to me, and I was sur
prised to find that it works out so i
well. It is to the credit of the organ
ization that the policy and manage- I
ment of the paper is left entirely to j
the editor by the student body. ' ,
"Your paper has a balance be- j
tween local, national, and interna- i
tional news that is seldom found j
even in larger papers. And the man
ner in which the news is handled '
is an excellent criterion of the char- '
acter of your student body."
Rogers, who is head of the Kansas
State Agricultural College depart- I
ment of journalism and a former
newspaper man himself, is giving I
two courses in news writing and ,
one in copy reading this year at 1
Stanford.
