# CHINESE TO DEFY JAPAN'S NOTE; U. S. MAPS ACTION
## America Urges Settlement Of Manchunan Crisis 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. (/P) —
The United States has urged the
League of Nations "to assert all
pressure and authority within its
competence"' toward settling the dis
pute in Manchuria.
While assuring the League of its
co-operation in the Chinese-Japa
nese situation, the American Gov
ernment has reserved the right to
act independently to back up what
the League does, or to invoke the
Kellogg-Briand pact for renuncia
tion of war or the nine-power treaty
of 1922.
U.S. Policy Defined
"I believe that our co-operation
in the future handling of this dif
ficult matter," said a message ad
dressed by the Secretary of State to
the secretary general of the league,
"should proceed along the course
which has been followed ever since
the first outbreak of the trouble. . . .
"The council has formulated con
clusions and outlined a course of
action to be followed by the dis
putants; and, as the said disputants
have made commitments to the
council, it is most desirable that the
league in no way relax its vigilance
and in no way fail to assert all the
pressure and authority within its
competence toward regulating the
action of China and Japan in the
premises.
"On its part the American gov
ernment, acting independently
through its diplomatic representa
tives will endeavor to reinforce
what the league does and will make
clear it has a keen interest in the
matter."
