# MUD FIGHT SET FOR THURSDAY
## Classes To Let Off Steam On Football Field 
### 
j Still smarting from their laughable
attempt at a raid last Tuesday night,
I the sophomore class has become
j even more rabid on the subject of
j the Class of '35 with the announce
j ment from Bob Brown, student body
i president, that the mud flinging
| will take place Thursday at 3 o'clock
on the Grays' field.
The soprs have been unable to
; overcome the yearlings for the past
! three years, and the Class of '34 re
' sents the feeling, held in most
j quarters, that they have little chance
j to chalk up a victory over the husky
| '35 boys.
Freshmen report that their or
; ganization is practically complete,
and they expect to take the sophs
j into camp with a minimum of effort
j and a maximum of mud.
The frosh are said to be relying
j on the far-flung rumor that sopho
j mores never turn out for the annual
! interclass battles. But leaders of the
' '34 men state that the first part of
their campaign to end the reign of
the freshman classes in this classic
has been to enlist the services of
the entire class. If this is true, it
should be a battle of the centuries,
! since most of the husky members
[ of '34 are quartered along the Row,
j and the Greek-letter boys are usu
; ally the absentees when the annual
I tussles come off.
