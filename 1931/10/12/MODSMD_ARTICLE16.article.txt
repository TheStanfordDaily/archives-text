# UNUSUAL STAMINA PROLONGS EDISON'S BATTLE FOR LIFE
## 
### 
, WEST ORANGE, Oct. 11. (JP) â€”
I Thomas A. Edison, roused with dif
j ficulty today from a 17-hour sleep,
I was given only a week more of life
jby his physician, Dr. Hubert S.
| Howe.
Although the 84-year-old inventor
| again recognized his wife who has
! been almost constantly at his bed
j side during his illness, his condition
was such that Dr. Howe said, "we
I cannot reasonably expect him to
! live another seven days. Edison's
; unusual stamina makes it impos
i sible for us to say how much longer
Mr. Edison will continue his stub
! born battle to live."'
For the first time since August,
| when the inventor was stricken by a
) complication of uremic poisoning,
i diabetes, ulcers of the stomach, and
j Bright's disease, Dr. Howe spent the
greater part of the day in the sick
room.
; It was only with difficulty that
i Dr. Howe was able to rouse his pa-
I tient from a sleep which started at
I 3:30 p.m. Saturday and extended
J "almost continuously" until 8:30
| a.m. today.
