—A declaraiton of confidence in the
American dollar and an assurance
President Hoover's latest financial |
plan is "decidedly not a measure of j
inflation" were given to an informal j
conference of chiefs of nine Euro- j
pean and Japanese banks tonight by j
Rudolph Burgess, representative of'
the Federal Reserve Bank of New l
York.
Burgess talked to his banker col- j
leagues about American financial in- ]
stitutions for an hour and a half and '
then answered a number of their j
questions.
He explained in detail President j
Hoover's plan for a national credit J
institution and declared it would not |
create more credit, but only make I
existing credit more available to the I
public.

Any rumors and suggestions, he
said, that the United States mone- |
tary system is threatened with a'
gold shortage are "absurd." His pro- j
nouncement was regarded here as j
the answer of the Federal Reserve i
system to recent reports of "insta- |
bility in the American financial j
structure.
Rumors of proposals for an inter- j
national currency were said in au- I
thoritative circles to be "fantasies'" !
and it was said this possibility would ;
not be discussed by the World Bank !
directorate. %
Plan Credit Talk
The directors and Burgess have a !
long agenda for tomorrow's session, j
chiefly concerned with credits. A'
decision must be made on the ques- '
tion of renewing the $100,000,000 re- j
discount credit to the German j
Reichsbank, of which one-fourth has
been subscribed by the World Bank.
The United States, Great Britain,
and France are the other subscrib
ers. This credit, extended for three
months, expires November 4.
It generally was believed the di
rectors were not likely to call an
international money conference. The
opinion seemed to be that any deci
sive move would be untimely now,
while the results of the conferences ,
of President Hoover and Premier
Laval are awaited, as well as the re
sult of the British elections.

Rumors of proposals for an inter- j
national currency were said in au- I
thoritative circles to be "fantasies'" !
and it was said this possibility would ;
not be discussed by the World Bank !
directorate. %
Plan Credit Talk
The directors and Burgess have a !
long agenda for tomorrow's session, j
chiefly concerned with credits. A'
decision must be made on the ques- '
tion of renewing the $100,000,000 re- j
discount credit to the German j
Reichsbank, of which one-fourth has
been subscribed by the World Bank.
The United States, Great Britain,
and France are the other subscrib
ers. This credit, extended for three
months, expires November 4.
It generally was believed the di
rectors were not likely to call an
international money conference. The
opinion seemed to be that any deci
sive move would be untimely now,
while the results of the conferences ,
of President Hoover and Premier
Laval are awaited, as well as the re
sult of the British elections.
