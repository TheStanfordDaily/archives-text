# Rejuvenated Cards Defeat Gophers 13-0
## First String Backfield of Hillman, Allen, Moffatt, and Caddel Exhibit Great Power MOFFATT SCINTILLATES Hand Gives Outstanding Performance In Line 
### BY LOWELL COX Daily Sports Editor 
The Stanford puzzle has been
solved.
Hillman, Allen, MofTatt, and Cad
del worked out the answer Saturday
afternoon, a 13 to 0 victory over a
powerful University of Minnesota
team, to prove that the 1931 Stan
lord eleven IS a ball elub.
"Pop" Warner turned on full
power Saturday for the first time
this season, and the result was en
tirely satisfactory. The game showed
that the Indians are steadily im
proving from Saturday to Saturday,
and that, at full strength, it will,
take a mighty team to stop them.
Some early-season defects were
shown, but these will undoubtedly
be ironed out in another week or
two.
Hard Fought Game
The game was a bitterly coniested
one, with Minnesota proving just as
formidable an opponent as adver
tised. With Captain Harry Hillman
just out of the hospital after a
"flu" scare, Warner didn't "shoot
the works" until the second quarter.
As a result, the Gophers had
things all their own way in the
opening period. Twice they knocked
at the door, each time incomplete
passes over the goal line ending
their threats to score.
First Quarter Even
Not once in that first quarter did
a strong Stanford backfield com
posed of Baker, Lambert, Campbell,
and Alien carry the ball past mid
field. The Gophers were not driven
into their own territory until just
before the period ended. After
Campbell had reeled off 21 yards
on a run around left end to th<-
49-yard line, Minnesota stiffened,
and Campbell punted on fourth
down to the Gopher 14-yard line,
Ehl horn downing the ball as the
period ended.
THEN Warner sent in MofTatt,
Hillman, and Caddel in quick suc
cession for Campbell, Baker, and
i Lambert, leaving Allen at full, i
THEN the "game changed.
Second Period Stanford s
The second quarter was all otan- j
; ford, just as the first period was all
! Minnesota. It was not until the final
1 period that the Indians were able
: to score, but they gave promise of ;
what was to come in that second j
! quarter. Twice they marched to ,
| scoring territory, once to the 6-yard j
I line, only to have Somers intercept j
1 a pass each time on his owft 1-yard j
'line and scamper to safety.
After the half-time rest the
I Gophers came back to demonstrate ,
| just what formidable opponents they j
' were. Somers took Caddel's kick- j
' oft' on his own 15-yard line and was j
; not brought down until he reached j
Stanford's 45-yard stripe. The Go- j
I phers just missed a first down, and j
I Munn punted to the Indian 12-yard j
! line. From here, however, the War- :
j ner machine slowly but surely j
j worked itself out of the hole. After :
; several exchanges of punts, Moffatt j
booted one from his own 32-yard ;
line to the Minnesota 22-yard mark- j
j er, where it was downed by Neill '
just one yard in from the side line. ;
Hand Recovers Fumble
Honors were even on the first ex- !
! change of punts, but on the second j
Somers fumbled the ball, Hand re- j
i covering for Stanford on the Go- ;
: phers' 21-yard line. From this point
j on there never was any doubt, as to
, the outcome of the game.
On the second play Allen's pass
j to Caddel took thi; ball to the four
i yard line. Hillman was held for a
j yard as the quarter ended, and on j
the first play of the final period
' Caddel charged over on a reverse
: through right tackle for the touch
down. Moffatt added the extra point,
Hillman holding.

, The first score might have been
the result of a break, but the second
i certainly was not. Manders, the j
i big Minnesota fullback, kicked off
< to Hand, who was downed on his
i own 22-yard line. That was the last
i the Gophers saw of the ball until
! another touchdown hod been
j chalked up for Stanford.
Seventy-eight yards the Indians,
marched to 'he Minnesota goal. It
! was really 108 yards that Stanford
| advanced the ball, because of two
' 15-yard penalties. There was no
questioning the power and dccep
| tion of that attack. It was featured
! by passes by both Allen and Mof- j
' fatt, shots by Moffatt and Caddel i
I through the line and around the j
j flanks, and pile-driver smashes by j
Hillman over center. There was no ■
I telling where that attack was going j
I to strike next.

afternoon, a 13 to 0 victory over a
powerful University of Minnesota
team, to prove that the 1931 Stan

"Pop" Warner turned on full
power Saturday for the first time
this season, and the result was en
tirely satisfactory. The game showed
that the Indians are steadily im
proving from Saturday to Saturday,
and that, at full strength, it will,
take a mighty team to stop them.
Some early-season defects were
shown, but these will undoubtedly
be ironed out in another week or

Hard Fought Game
The game was a bitterly coniested
one, with Minnesota proving just as
formidable an opponent as adver
tised. With Captain Harry Hillman
just out of the hospital after a
"flu" scare, Warner didn't "shoot
the works" until the second quarter.
As a result, the Gophers had
things all their own way in the
opening period. Twice they knocked
at the door, each time incomplete
passes over the goal line ending
their threats to score.
First Quarter Even
Not once in that first quarter did
a strong Stanford backfield com
posed of Baker, Lambert, Campbell,
and Alien carry the ball past mid
field. The Gophers were not driven
into their own territory until just
before the period ended. After
Campbell had reeled off 21 yards
on a run around left end to th<-
49-yard line, Minnesota stiffened,
and Campbell punted on fourth
down to the Gopher 14-yard line,

Hillman, Allen, MofTatt, and Cad

afternoon, a 13 to 0 victory over a
powerful University of Minnesota
team, to prove that the 1931 Stan
lord eleven IS a ball elub.
"Pop" Warner turned on full
power Saturday for the first time
this season, and the result was en
tirely satisfactory. The game showed
that the Indians are steadily im
proving from Saturday to Saturday,
and that, at full strength, it will,
take a mighty team to stop them.
Some early-season defects were
shown, but these will undoubtedly
be ironed out in another week or

Hard Fought Game
The game was a bitterly coniested
one, with Minnesota proving just as
formidable an opponent as adver
tised. With Captain Harry Hillman
just out of the hospital after a
"flu" scare, Warner didn't "shoot
the works" until the second quarter.
As a result, the Gophers had
things all their own way in the
opening period. Twice they knocked
at the door, each time incomplete
passes over the goal line ending
their threats to score.
First Quarter Even
Not once in that first quarter did
a strong Stanford backfield com
posed of Baker, Lambert, Campbell,
and Alien carry the ball past mid
field. The Gophers were not driven
into their own territory until just
before the period ended. After
Campbell had reeled off 21 yards
on a run around left end to th<-

and Campbell punted on fourth

Second Period Stanford s
The second quarter was all otan- j
; ford, just as the first period was all
! Minnesota. It was not until the final
1 period that the Indians were able
: to score, but they gave promise of ;
what was to come in that second j
! quarter. Twice they marched to ,
| scoring territory, once to the 6-yard j
I line, only to have Somers intercept j
1 a pass each time on his owft 1-yard j
'line and scamper to safety.
After the half-time rest the
I Gophers came back to demonstrate ,
| just what formidable opponents they j
' were. Somers took Caddel's kick- j
' oft' on his own 15-yard line and was j
; not brought down until he reached j
Stanford's 45-yard stripe. The Go- j
I phers just missed a first down, and j
I Munn punted to the Indian 12-yard j
! line. From here, however, the War- :
j ner machine slowly but surely j
j worked itself out of the hole. After :
; several exchanges of punts, Moffatt j
booted one from his own 32-yard ;
line to the Minnesota 22-yard mark- j
j er, where it was downed by Neill '
just one yard in from the side line. ;
Hand Recovers Fumble
Honors were even on the first ex- !
! change of punts, but on the second j
Somers fumbled the ball, Hand re- j
i covering for Stanford on the Go- ;
: phers' 21-yard line. From this point
j on there never was any doubt, as to
, the outcome of the game.
On the second play Allen's pass
j to Caddel took thi; ball to the four
i yard line. Hillman was held for a
j yard as the quarter ended, and on j
the first play of the final period
' Caddel charged over on a reverse
: through right tackle for the touch
down. Moffatt added the extra point,
Hillman holding.

, The first score might have been

i certainly was not. Manders, the j
i big Minnesota fullback, kicked off
< to Hand, who was downed on his
i own 22-yard line. That was the last
i the Gophers saw of the ball until

j chalked up for Stanford.
Seventy-eight yards the Indians,
marched to 'he Minnesota goal. It
! was really 108 yards that Stanford
| advanced the ball, because of two
' 15-yard penalties. There was no
