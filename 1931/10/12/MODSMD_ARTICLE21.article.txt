# Rejuvenated Cards Defeat Gophers 13-0
## First String Backfield of Hillman, Allen, Moffatt, and Caddel Exhibit Great Power MOFFATT SCINTILLATES Hand Gives Outstanding Performance In Line 
### BY LOWELL COX Daily Sports Editor 
The Stanford puzzle has been
solved.
Hillman, Allen, MofTatt, and Cad
del worked out the answer Saturday
afternoon, a 13 to 0 victory over a
powerful University of Minnesota
team, to prove that the 1931 Stan
lord eleven IS a ball elub.
"Pop" Warner turned on full
power Saturday for the first time
this season, and the result was en
tirely satisfactory. The game showed
that the Indians are steadily im
proving from Saturday to Saturday,
and that, at full strength, it will,
take a mighty team to stop them.
Some early-season defects were
shown, but these will undoubtedly
be ironed out in another week or
two.
Hard Fought Game
The game was a bitterly coniested
one, with Minnesota proving just as
formidable an opponent as adver
tised. With Captain Harry Hillman
just out of the hospital after a
"flu" scare, Warner didn't "shoot
the works" until the second quarter.
As a result, the Gophers had
things all their own way in the
opening period. Twice they knocked
at the door, each time incomplete
passes over the goal line ending
their threats to score.
First Quarter Even
Not once in that first quarter did
a strong Stanford backfield com
posed of Baker, Lambert, Campbell,
and Alien carry the ball past mid
field. The Gophers were not driven
into their own territory until just
before the period ended. After
Campbell had reeled off 21 yards
on a run around left end to th<-
49-yard line, Minnesota stiffened,
and Campbell punted on fourth
down to the Gopher 14-yard line,
Ehl horn downing the ball as the
period ended.
THEN Warner sent in MofTatt,
Hillman, and Caddel in quick suc
cession for Campbell, Baker, and
