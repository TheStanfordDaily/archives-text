# WHAT ABOUT THE CO-OP?
## 
### 
Stanford's Students' Co-operative Purchasing Associa
tion has come under a good deal of criticism since the be
ginning of the quarter on the grounds that outside mer
chants can undersell the organization on food products
that are used in the various living groups.
This criticism is aided and abetted by interested mer
chants who have wares to sell. Maybe the criticism is jus
tified; maybe it isn't. At any rate, a return to the state of
a flairs that existed before the Co-op was organized would
be regrettable.
All the house managers have a vital interest in this
problem, and it is up to them and the houses they serve to
lind out the facts of the situation. Then they must gel
behind the association unanimously or do away with it
entirely. There can be no half-way mark in a co-operative
group.
