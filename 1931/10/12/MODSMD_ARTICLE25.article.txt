In ji recent issue of Iho Daily (Uijifomian was printed ,
I lie following let lor :
"To the Edilor:
"I should he very grateful if someone would answer
litis (! lies lion for me authentically. Why docs Stanford
always keep the shady side of the stadium for herself and
give all visiting colleges the hot, sunny side? This action
seems very discourteous to me, and 1 should like to know!
the real reason for it. â€¢
"(Signed) Anxious."
In the contract of several years' standing California was '
given the east side, not that the Stanford rooters might
view the game without the disadvantage of having the sun
in their eyes, but to facilitate parking for the Blue and j
Cold enthusiasts. If Anxious has ever attended a game at
the Stanford stadium, lie or she will realize that entrance
and exit to the grounds is easier and much traflic can he,
avoided if the cars can go directly from the highway to the j
east side rather than driving through the campus.
This year, the contract having expired, California has
chosen to sit on the shady side, preferring, evidently, the;
lack of sun despite the disadvantage of having to walk
around the stadium or endure the congested traffic on the
campus. The Indian rooters, too, will he forced to do ;i
bit of walking, having to enter the stadium at the side;
opposite from their usual approach.
Whether the advantage to the California supoprters i
will compensate for the melee, congestion, and confusion
that will result from the switching of sides is extremely I
doubtful.
