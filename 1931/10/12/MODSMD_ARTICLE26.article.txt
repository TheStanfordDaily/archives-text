A foreboding of future (rouble was reflected las! week
cud fts Jonathan A. Butler, the Pacific (.oast Conference's
new commissioner, or invcstigator-at-large, went into of
ficial action by probing the status of Joe IJllard, l iiiver
sitv of Oregon negro football star.
The fact that Butler drew the ire of Coach "Doc"
Spears, Wcbfoot coach, is to be expected, of course. No
coach likes to face the prospect of playing a big game
without his best back, and Lillard almost didn't play. Ore
gon authorities suspended him temporarily and reinstated
him on the eve of the, Washington contest only after Butler
had been satisfied that the player had not engaged in semi
professional baseball.
Professor W. B. Owens of Stanford, president of the
Conference, maintained that Butler's action was absolutely
in keeping with his assignment. If that is true, then a lot
of hell is due to pop before the commissioner's one-year
term expires. Queer situations exist throughout the Pacific
Coast circuit if would be ridiculous to deny that. One »>l
these davs Butler mav stumble over a hot one.
