# BULL SESSION
## "NO EXTRAS NEEDED"—HERBERT HOOVER 
### 
The last session of Congress had
hardly ended—the Congressmen had
barely finished reporting to their
bailiwicks how they, individually
t>nd without aid, had run the last
session—when the President was
already bombarded with demands,
requests, and suggestions for an ex
tra session of Congress.
Every Democratic and many Re
publican Congressmen were sure
that they, and they alone, had the
secret that would save the country—
they knew how to stop the drought,
curb the floods, make stocks go up,
and taxes come down. All that these
congressmen needed to recreate
Paradise Lost—Valhalla —and the
Elysian fields—all rolled into one,
plus some typically Yankee features,
was an opportunity to px'esent their
plan in Congress.
In fact every time something hap
pens to the country—good, bad, or
indifferent; or Hoover does some
thing; or Hoover fails to do some
thing—somebody wants an extra
session of Congress. In fact if the
President conceded to all these re
quests, Congress would be in ses
sion every day in the year—and one
day more in leap year too. Of course,
this is just what some people want.
Men like Senator Borah don't en
joy living in a state that has more
goats than citizens—or more sheep
than people—or more animals of
some description. He would rather
be a part of Washington society. At
present, many papers are content to
let this "Shaggy Bear" ramble all
around the Idaho mountains —
grumbling to himself and the few
other people in those parts; but dur
ing a session, Borah is front page

| news in any man's paper. And for
I a congressman not to live in his
j own state between sessions is a di
i rect insult to the best state in the
Union, and political suicide of the
' quick, sure, and painless variety.
Hoover, however, has his own
j reasons for not calling an extra ses
sion of Congress. No one likes criti—
jcism; and calling Congress is calling
j fcrth criticism of a severe variety.
!It is bad enough when they meet
automatically, lout to ask them to
I meet is Asking too much. When they
| meet regularly in December, Hoover
| can blame them on the Constitu
tion; but if called into special ses-
I sion, he must shoulder all responsi
bility. Now, the President's opposi
tion is divided and relatively inef
| fective; when they meet, however,
j Hoover fears the worst.
And Hoovef has reason to fear
Congress. He cSlled one special ses
sion before, and he is still hearing
!of what they did. Furthermore the
! Congress that will meet will be di
vided almost evenly between the
I two parties; and with progressives
j of both parties breaking across party
. fences, Hoover knows that he has
j no tea party in store.
And lastly, at present the Presi
i dent is the leading and practically
| only person on the national stage,
i When the congressional chorus ar
j rives, however, a lot of fancy kickers
j will take the public eye, you can
| be sure; some of the chorus may be
| seeking the leading role and they
I will kick high, croon prosperity and
| relief ballads, or feature themselves
in beer-tub acts to accomplish their
| desire. Hoover knows all this. Can
you blame the man for not calling
] Congress? —Abe Mellinkoff.

plan in Congress.
In fact every time something hap
pens to the country—good, bad, or
indifferent; or Hoover does some
thing; or Hoover fails to do some
thing—somebody wants an extra
session of Congress. In fact if the
President conceded to all these re
quests, Congress would be in ses
sion every day in the year—and one
day more in leap year too. Of course,
this is just what some people want.
Men like Senator Borah don't en
joy living in a state that has more
goats than citizens—or more sheep
than people—or more animals of
some description. He would rather
be a part of Washington society. At
present, many papers are content to
let this "Shaggy Bear" ramble all
around the Idaho mountains —
grumbling to himself and the few
other people in those parts; but dur
ing a session, Borah is front page

| news in any man's paper. And for
I a congressman not to live in his
j own state between sessions is a di
i rect insult to the best state in the
Union, and political suicide of the
' quick, sure, and painless variety.
Hoover, however, has his own
j reasons for not calling an extra ses
sion of Congress. No one likes criti—
jcism; and calling Congress is calling
j fcrth criticism of a severe variety.
!It is bad enough when they meet
automatically, lout to ask them to
I meet is Asking too much. When they
| meet regularly in December, Hoover
| can blame them on the Constitu
tion; but if called into special ses-
I sion, he must shoulder all responsi
bility. Now, the President's opposi
tion is divided and relatively inef
| fective; when they meet, however,
j Hoover fears the worst.
And Hoovef has reason to fear
Congress. He cSlled one special ses
sion before, and he is still hearing
!of what they did. Furthermore the
! Congress that will meet will be di
vided almost evenly between the
I two parties; and with progressives
j of both parties breaking across party
. fences, Hoover knows that he has
j no tea party in store.
And lastly, at present the Presi
i dent is the leading and practically
| only person on the national stage,
i When the congressional chorus ar
j rives, however, a lot of fancy kickers
j will take the public eye, you can
| be sure; some of the chorus may be
| seeking the leading role and they
I will kick high, croon prosperity and
| relief ballads, or feature themselves
in beer-tub acts to accomplish their
| desire. Hoover knows all this. Can
you blame the man for not calling
] Congress? —Abe Mellinkoff.
The last session of Congress had
hardly ended—the Congressmen had
barely finished reporting to their
bailiwicks how they, individually
t>nd without aid, had run the last
session—when the President was
already bombarded with demands,
requests, and suggestions for an ex
tra session of Congress.
Every Democratic and many Re
publican Congressmen were sure
that they, and they alone, had the
secret that would save the country—
they knew how to stop the drought,
curb the floods, make stocks go up,
and taxes come down. All that these
congressmen needed to recreate
Paradise Lost—Valhalla —and the
Elysian fields—all rolled into one,
plus some typically Yankee features,
was an opportunity to px'esent their
plan in Congress.
