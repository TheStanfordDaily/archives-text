WICKED—At the Varsity Theatre. |
Wicked is exactly what Margot j
Rande is not. In the first two min- j
utes a bank robbery is scored. Mar- j
got is then faced in succeeding sec- ;
onds with the fact that her husband '
of a few months is a robber, and i
with a squad of armed police. At I
this point she shoots one of the |
police.
Elissa Landi does a superb piece i
of acting. In a part that is quite op- ;
posite to her refined beauty and re- !
served type she manages to keep in
character. She handles the stereo- !
typed climaxes wtih just the right |
degree of emotional display. Miss
Landi's dignified performance is j
worthy of the Hapsburg family of ,
which she is a member.
Victor McLaglen is a typical for- j
mer admirer without being especial- j
ly outstanding. He suffers more <han r
Miss Landi from the weakness of ,
the plot.
The show as a whole succeeds in |
being the most unreal thing we've i
seen in a long time. There is a per
fectly delightful prison scene. The |
convicts are just too charming, '
clever, and pretty. The words put j
into Miss Landi's mouth when she j
is; denied her child are actually, '"Oh, |
how could you!" When they saw !
this crisis coming some roughs be- I
hind us said, "We might as well get j
out a cigarette now." When they j
heard these feeble words ihey sim- j
ply didn't bother. —E.T.P.

After the ordinary run of mystery i
and detective films one is inclined '

I to fight shy of them. This is the ex
i ception. Despite an extremely un
i likely ending, the plot and incidents
I of the film hang together extraor
j dinarily well to make a story which
'is unceasingly gripping. ' ' i

i is but a shade short of excellent. |
; He and Kay Francis, who plays the

; man, share the laurels. The intense '
I conflict between the two provides .
'the greatest interest of the picture. J
| The other characters serve merely h
las background. Apparently the di
| rectors meant Polly Moran to inject
; a modicum of comic relief but Ihey I
| either changed their minds or for- j
i got her presence to the harm of ;
I nobody.
The preliminaries as usual were
. excruciatingly bad with the possible

WICKED—At the Varsity Theatre. |
Wicked is exactly what Margot j
Rande is not. In the first two min- j
utes a bank robbery is scored. Mar- j
got is then faced in succeeding sec- ;
onds with the fact that her husband '
of a few months is a robber, and i
with a squad of armed police. At I
this point she shoots one of the |
police.
Elissa Landi does a superb piece i
of acting. In a part that is quite op- ;
posite to her refined beauty and re- !
served type she manages to keep in
character. She handles the stereo- !
typed climaxes wtih just the right |
degree of emotional display. Miss
Landi's dignified performance is j
worthy of the Hapsburg family of ,
which she is a member.
Victor McLaglen is a typical for- j
mer admirer without being especial- j
ly outstanding. He suffers more <han r
Miss Landi from the weakness of ,
the plot.
The show as a whole succeeds in |
being the most unreal thing we've i
seen in a long time. There is a per
fectly delightful prison scene. The |
convicts are just too charming, '
clever, and pretty. The words put j
into Miss Landi's mouth when she j
is; denied her child are actually, '"Oh, |
how could you!" When they saw !
this crisis coming some roughs be- I
hind us said, "We might as well get j
out a cigarette now." When they j
heard these feeble words ihey sim- j
ply didn't bother. —E.T.P.
