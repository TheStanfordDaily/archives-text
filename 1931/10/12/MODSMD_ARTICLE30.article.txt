Perhaps nothing on the campus
offers a wider view of the many
| beauties of Stanford than the pam
! phlet and trick folding post card
sets offered to tourists in front of
! Memorial Court. Although arranged
; in different order, all the sets offer
! a series like this:
I 1. View of Memorial Church
through arch. 2. Arch, near Me
morial Church. 3. Arches, Stanford
University. 4. Mosaic of Memorial
Church, seen near an ax*ch. 5. Arch,
j Memorial Church mosaic in back
i ground. 6. Library, glimpsed through
: arches. 7. Arches, Library in back
| ground. 7. Side view of Memorial
Church, arches in foreground. 8.
! Memorial Church, Stanford Univer
j sity.
No wonder the old lady, after
looking over the view cards, asked
innocently, "But do the boys
take holy orders?"
Thumbnail definition of the
old style flapper: A moron with
less on.
In the popular mythology of cer
tain journalism textbooks the col
umnist is supposed to possess the
fattest of jobs in newspaper life, an
existence notoriously lacking in

obese luxuries. In addition to being
' paid sufficient money to subscribe
to his own paper, the columnist is
alleged to be able to shut off the
alarm clock in the morning. Accord
ing to this legend, life for the col
umnist in any office, even the Daily,
is like this:
j Trumpets ta-da at ft o'clock (his
; copy is due at two but of course no
j one expects him to be on time) to
announce the entry of the columnist.
| As the stall lines up, pikes raised
1 and berets doffed, on each side of
. the door, the associate editor spreads
| his leather jacket for the columnist
; to tread on. This is not done be
j cause there is 1 mud on the floor,
j which there really is, but just so he
! can walk on the jacket. (See Atkins,
Treatment of the Columnist, page 7.)
After this he dictates with as
i founding speed to thirteen beautiful
1 stenographers simultaneously four
I book-fulls of bon mots, verses, short
' stories, and jokes. This done, he is
j carried off in a divan and after j
1 seven days of shutting off the alarm i
| clock returns to repeat the perform- j
l ance.
In reality the columnist sneaks in j
j by a side door about 3 o'clock in the j
morning and sits until noon won- ,
I dering what to say. During the in- j

; terim he is in grave danger of being
swept from the office by the janitor.
1 (The last three Daily columnists
were thus lost to posterity, although
• one lodged himself in a typewriter
for a year and took delight in mak- ;
: ing reporters misspell their words).
4 Here he sits until the editor yells,
"Where in is the column,"
when he goes up to him, pulls at
his trouser cuff and hands over his
copy, which is immediately torn up
so the whole thing can start over
i again.
This last version, of course, is all
aqueously saturated. The columnist
is really treated as in the first para- j
graph, except that in Washington,
D.C., President Hoover and Secre
tary Wilbur stand at attention while
1 he enters.
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 11. (TP) —A
