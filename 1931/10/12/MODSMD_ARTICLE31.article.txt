# Bruin Babes Score 13-7 Victory Over Card Yearlings
## STANFORD UNABLE TO STOP 1ST HALF DRIVE OF U.C.L.A. Inability To Cash In On Scoring Chances Loses Game 
### Francis Hamilton 
An experienced, heavier U.C.L.A.
freshman eleven got the jump on
the Stanford Babes, scored a brace
of touchdowns in rapid succession
luring the first half, and the result
was a 13 to 7 victory for the Brums,
in the preliminary to the Stanford-
Minnesota clash Saturday.
Soon after the kick-off the Cai
dinal team was driven into its own
territory where it languisntd for the
remainder of the first hall, incapable
of shutting off the Uclan scoring
stream.
Three Card Centers
Already badly weakened at the
center of the line by the loss of Van
Kirk and Semmelroth, Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw was forced to dig deep
into his meagre bag of reserves
when Bates, who started at center,
was injured. Pope, a new man on
the squad, adequately replaced him
until lie also was injured. Ray com
pleted the game at center for Stan
ford.
Stanford returned to the game
with an entirely different spirit in
the second half and packed the ball
all over the field, that is all over
except that part of the field con
taining the visitors' goal line. In
this characteristic way they were
strongly reminiscent of the Stan
ford varsity of old.
Only Midiield Drive
Out in midfield Seaver, Rothert,
and Moore could crack the West
wood line wide open for consistent
gains, and the passes flung by Sea
ver and Rothert were a constant
scoring threat. Down inside the ten
yard mark yardage was scarcer for
the Cards than the well-known pul
let's molars.
In the second half Stanford began
a beautiful drive from their own
20-yard mark. Passes mixed with
powerful drives by Seaver and
Moore carried to the U.C.L.A. 28-
yard mark where one of Seavers
aerial shots was intercepted. The
Bruins could do nothing and kicked
to Rothert who returned the ball
10 yards from his own 45.
Second Attack Stopped
The Indian babes repeated "their
drive twice; once being stopped on
the 9-yard line where a pass to
Kahn failed by inches for a first
down. Again the little Red Machine
moved down to U.C.L.A.'s 3-yard
line before the gears stopped spin
ning. Finally the forward lateral
touchdown play scored from the
15-yard stripe with Rothert lugging
the ball.
U.C.L.A. took the ball on the
kick-off and relinquished it to Stan
ford. Again began that powerful

-hooting passes from all angles.

into his meagre bag of reserves
when Bates, who started at center,
was injured. Pope, a new man on
the squad, adequately replaced him
until lie also was injured. Ray com
pleted the game at center for Stan
ford.
Stanford returned to the game
with an entirely different spirit in
the second half and packed the ball
all over the field, that is all over
except that part of the field con
taining the visitors' goal line. In
this characteristic way they were
strongly reminiscent of the Stan
ford varsity of old.
Only Midiield Drive
Out in midfield Seaver, Rothert,
and Moore could crack the West
wood line wide open for consistent
gains, and the passes flung by Sea
ver and Rothert were a constant
scoring threat. Down inside the ten
yard mark yardage was scarcer for
the Cards than the well-known pul
let's molars.
In the second half Stanford began
a beautiful drive from their own
20-yard mark. Passes mixed with
powerful drives by Seaver and
Moore carried to the U.C.L.A. 28-
yard mark where one of Seavers
aerial shots was intercepted. The
Bruins could do nothing and kicked
to Rothert who returned the ball
10 yards from his own 45.
Second Attack Stopped
The Indian babes repeated "their
drive twice; once being stopped on
the 9-yard line where a pass to
Kahn failed by inches for a first
down. Again the little Red Machine
moved down to U.C.L.A.'s 3-yard
line before the gears stopped spin
ning. Finally the forward lateral
touchdown play scored from the
15-yard stripe with Rothert lugging
the ball.
U.C.L.A. took the ball on the
kick-off and relinquished it to Stan
ford. Again began that powerful

Soon after the kick-off the Cai
