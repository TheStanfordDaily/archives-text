## FOUND: A PASSER 
### 
"Who will do the passing for
Stanford this year?"
The question came up as a group
of scribes was watching the first
practice of the season, and somebody
wanted a picture of a Stanford man
passing the ball.
With Simkins gone, apparently
only Mofiatt remained, and he was
conceded to be more valuable on
the received end of an aerial attack.
'"Dusty" Allen provided the an
swer to the question Saturday, when
he threw passes all over the lot in
a manner which would have done
credit to Billy Simkins himself at
his best.
With Moffatt doing some of the
heaving just by way of crossing the
boys up, the Indians attempted 19
passes Saturday, completing 10 of
them for a total of 130 yards. But
while you marvel at the spectacular
passing attack flashed by the Indians
Saturday, remember that they rolled
up 252 yards, minus 35 lost, from
scrimmage.
The transfer of Ernie Caddel
from fullback to half was a suc
cessful move. At a post where
his speed may be used to greater
advantage, Caddel took the hon
ors in the running department
Saturday. In 13 attempts he ad
vanced the ball (14 yards, an av
erage of 4 yards per carry. This
was not only the biggest total
of the day, hut the highest av
erage of any back who carried
the ball more than four times.
One of the most interesting facts
reflected in the official figures of the
game shows that Minnesota, with
the famed Munn doing most of the
punting, was out-kicked by Stan
ford. The average length of the Go
pher punts was 33 yards, while that
of the Indians' was 36 yards.
