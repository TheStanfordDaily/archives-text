# DAY OF UPSETS
## 
### 
Saturday was the first big field
day of upsets this fall. In the first
| place, the St. Louis Cardinals de
j feated the Athletics in the final
game of the world series, winning a
pennant which fans and experts
; alike believed would stay in the
! possession of Connie Mack for the
third consecutive year. As a result
lof the Cards' victory, Howard
| Moore, most ardent baseball fan on
i the campus, is today sadder and
' wiser (and poorer).
Northwestern opened a day of
! football upsets by holding Notre
Dame to a scoreless tie, breaking a
20-game string of victories rolled
I up by the Ramblers.
On the coast, however, occurred
two of the biggest reversals of the
day. California downed the Olym
pic Club, 6 to 0. They won the only
way they could win—by a fortunate
pass—but win they did.
I The championship of the North
j west was probably decided when
Oregon kicked over the elope buck
et by defeating Washington, 13 to 0,
in a game which was also won by
an aerial attack.
Charlie may or may not
be sacrificing bis immediate
chances of winning the National
Amateur golf crown by playing
football, but he certainly shows
promise of making good in a big
way on the gridiron. In Satur-
I day's freshman game he carried
the ball 21 times for a net total
of f>4 yards, an average of ap
proximately three yards per
I carry.—L.M.C.
