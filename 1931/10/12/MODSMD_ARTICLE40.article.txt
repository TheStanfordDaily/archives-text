## 
### 
Stanford was well, represented last

national, and two local swimming
affairs on various parts of the globe.
Austin Clapp, last year's team cap
tain, Ted Wiget, former freshman
star, Frank Booth, this year's cap
tain, and John Gardner—these four

pionships at Honolulu.
Then two of these expert mermen
journeyed to Japan with an all-
American team to compete with an I
all-Japanese team in the "Nipponese '
waters. After all this, Clapp re
turned to add two more honors to
his collection, one at Oceanside, the
other at San Francisco.
The eventful portion of the sum
mer began July 14, which was the
first day of the meet in Honolulu,
during the three days of which the
tboys ranked in three places. Clapp
and Booth swam under the colors J
of the Hollywood Athletic Club and
were on *<\ world's record 800-meter

— i
placed second to Buster Crabbe of j
U.S.C. in ihe mile, and Wiget, swim- i
ming for the Athens Club of Oak
land, pulled through for a third in
the quarter-mile.
Upon returning to the home |
shores the Cardinal tank star won
the Oceanside half-mile swim, i
i pulling to the finish just 1-5 of a j
socond ahead of Booth. Then, on j
September 20, Clapp came up to i
San Francisco and negotiated the :
I Golden Gate in record time. The !
' record-holder attributes part of his j
success to the warmth of water and j
lack of currents, but mostly to the j
expert piloting of Coach Ernst •
Brandsten and Ed Throndsen, for- |
mer teammate. Clapp's time was 45 ;
