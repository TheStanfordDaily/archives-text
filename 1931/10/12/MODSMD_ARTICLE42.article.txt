# INDIAN SOCCERMEN HOLD FAST S. F. U. TEAM TO O-O TIE
## Work Of Stanford Backs, Led By Holmes, Saves Many Goals 
### 
Playing a fine brand of defensive
j soccer, the Stanford varsity held a
i brilliant S.F.U. team to a 0-0 score
! Friday afternoon on the local field.
Although the Indian forward wall
I showed its lack of practice, the Card
j halfbacks, fulls, and goalies played
j a game of soccer which bodes well
| for the success of this sport on the
> Farm during the current season.
Buster Holmes Stars
i Outstanding on the field Friday
was the work of Maloney's sterling
I fullback, Buster Holmes. Breaking
I up every advance on his side of the
j field, Holmes also gave invaluable
j aid to the goalie in holding off op
! posing forwards.
Two splendid chances for a score
| were missed by the Redshirls, one
in each half. In both cases the op
posing goalguard had been drawn
out and only a well-directed shot
was needed to ring the bell.
Moore Injured
It was learned after the game that
Moore, who played brilliantly at
i center half for Stanford, had been
: suffering from a cracked rib, an old
l' injury, during the whole progress
of the fracas, so that every deep
breath gave him decided pain.
As had been predicted, Art Hearn
was the outstanding man in the
| Cards' forward wall. Washburn, who
substituted for Moore, played a
very aggressive brand of ball which
gave notice that he would crash
varsity lineup at some position or
other before the season ended.

I by far the outstanding player, seem-
I ing to have complete control of his
