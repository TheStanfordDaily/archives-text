Blizzards, storm-bound igloos, dog
teams, and nine-hour airplane
flights, objects of romance and ad
venture to most persons, are every
day and commonplace to Professor
H. D. Anderson, who has returned
to Stanford after having spent ap
proximately two years on two dif
ferent trips in Alaska.
Anderson is in charge of an edu
cational survey being made in this
still comparatively uncivilized
country. The study, the object of
which is to determine the social
status and educational program in
Alaska, is being conducted by means
of a grant given to Stanford for this
purpose by the Carnegie Institute.
Anderson is being assisted by Dr.
Walter C. Eells, another Stanford
professor, who has charge of the
statistical and testing side of the
work, and by his wife, Mrs. Erma
Sands Anderson, who gives the in
telligence tests. Both of these per
sons made the trip with him.
The material gathered during the
expedition will be published in a
two-volume report which probably
will be completed by May.
The ultimate result of the study
will be the formulation of a prac
tical policy for the present school
generation from the social, economic,
and cultural viewpoints and which
will be in keeping with present edu
cational theories.
