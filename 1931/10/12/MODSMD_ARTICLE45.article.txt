# AMERICAN MELODIES PLAYED IN RECITAL
## 
### 
American folk music was the
trend which Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist, adopted yesterday
for his regular Sunday afternoon
organ recital.
Largo from "From the New
World" by Antonin Dvorjak, based
on the Negro melodies, was the best
on the program.
Puritan Procession, from "Pioneer
America" by Seth Bingham was also
very good. The sturdy, independent
spirit of the first American was ad
mirably shown.
