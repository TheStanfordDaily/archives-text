# BISHOP PLEADS FOR IDEAL OF KINDNESS IN CHAPEL SERMON
## 
### 
Stressing the point that kindness
to others is the best way to peace j
and self-contentment in these times
of turmoil, Bishop Ballas, visiting j
bishop from Massachusetts, sounded
the keynote of what was thought by ,
many of his listeners to be one of j
the best sermons which has been j
preached in the Chapel for some
time.
"It is up to the United States, j
which is now recognized as the j
greatest nation in the world, to lead
the way in Christian actions and
deeds. It is our duty as citizens of
this great nation to do our part,"
Bishop Ballas concluded.
Ballas will preach again next Sun
day morning in the Memorial
Church.
Michael Coughlan, who recently
died, aged 110, in the Tullamore
district, Ireland, could remember
the days of O'Connell and when
men worked for 8 cents a day.
