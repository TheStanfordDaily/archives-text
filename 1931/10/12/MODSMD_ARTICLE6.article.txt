Fire, caused by an overheated
flue, destroyed the roof and part of
the third floor of the Sigma Chi
house on Lasuen about 1 o'clock

down through the floors caused con
siderable damage to furnishings and
walls.
The flames were discovered in

furniture, so that the only damage
done was to the building. No esti
mate has been made as yet how
much it will cost to repair the de
stroyed portions of the house.
