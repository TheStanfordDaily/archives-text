## 
### 
This week's Tuesday evening lec
ture will be given by Professor H. R.
Fairclough in the Little Theatre at
7:30 o'clock on "An Archaeological
Tour of Mediterranean Lands."
Professor Fairclough recently re
turned from abroad where he spent
the last two years in travel, his spe
cial interest being that of archaeol
ogy. He began his trip in June 1929
and visited England and then Spain.
The rest of the time was spent in
Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and Italy,
where he visited cities of archaeo
logical interest, met the leading ar
chaeologists, and discussed their
problems with them.
