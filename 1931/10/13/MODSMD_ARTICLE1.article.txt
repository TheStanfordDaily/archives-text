# INDIANS AWAIT ONSLAUGHT OF 200-POUNDERS
## Beaver Linesmen Heaviest In Coast Conference; One Weighs 225 RIGHT HALF A THREAT Stanford Line Also Strong; Should Hold O.S.C. 
### 
There's no rest ior the weary.
Coach Glenn Scobey Warner and
his football warriors got by the Min
nesota man - mountains Saturday,
only to find an even more tremen
dous mass of beef looming in front
of them for the coming week-end,
in the persons of eleven menacing
Oregon State gridmen.
Possessing the almost unbelievable
line average of 199.59 pounds from
end to end, the Beaver aggregation
is undisputably the heaviest team in
the Pacific Coast Conference. For
all we know it is the heaviest in the
United States; certainly it should
be.
The weight is well distributed too,
for Cox, 186, at right guard is the
only lineman under 190 pounds,
while three men, Schwammel, Ber
gcrson, and Kent, are over 200. Ber
gcrson is rated at 225 pounds net,
but writers who watched Beaver
workouts earlier in the season de
clare that he doesn't register an
ounce less than 250, which makes
him a very sizeable gentleman to
push out of the way.
IJackfield Only 181
In the backfield the average drops
to a poundage of 184 owing to the
presence of quarterback Ward who
tips the scales at 155 to counterbal
ance three heavy ball - carrying
mates, Little, 202, Moe, 185, and
Rust, 194.
There is more than beef, however,
in the Orange and Black aggi'ega
tion, as spectators of last year's Car
dinal - Beaver game will testify.
Coach Paul Schissler has more than
a little up his sleeve when it comes
to offense, and he usually springs
some fast ones against Stanford.
Score on Passes
In 1929 Oregon State tossed a
touchdown pass on the first play of
the game, getting off to a 7-0 lead
before the surprised Indians knew
that the contest had started. The
Redmen came back with 40 points
of their own later on, which was all
right, but last year when the Bea
vers again got the jump Stanford
had a narrow escape from defeat,
the 13-7 victory being a lot closer
than the figures indicate.

With its tremendous line Oregon
State should be able to stop most
of the Stanford straight plays, and
since the Cardinal line is pretty
strong itself the visitors aren't like
ly to get much satisfaction from
pounding the forward wall. As the
result, some free passing, both lat
eral and forward, is expected to be
seen during the course of the after
noon.
Stanford will probably resort to
the same type of open game which
Warner used against Minnesota, var
ying the aerial attack with off-tackle
reverses and spin plays at center.
Schissler always gives his passer
plenty of action in every contest, so
right halfback Moe, Beaver triple
threat. man and chief motive power
of the invaders' baekfield, will un
doubtedly keep the Cards busy
watching his tosses.
Having received the good news
that none of the players were in
jured in the Minnesota tilt, Coach
Warner turned out full of pep yes
terday afternoon and proceeded to
give his cohorts a prolonged chalk
talk on their sins of omission and
commission Saturday.
The first two elevens took things
easily, but Pop put the third and
fourth strings through a brisk
scrimmage which gave him an op
portunity for a little experimenta
tion in defensive maneuvers.
