### 
A sweeping investigation was
launched last night by the Board
of Athletic Control to determine ii
Stanford has been victimized by a
state-wide football ticket counter
feiting ring uncovered by Berkeley
and San Francisco police.
More than 1000 counterfeited
tickets were sold and turned in at
the University of California-Uni
versity of Santa Clara game three
weeks ago, and a large number of
bogus tickets were turned in at the
U.C.-Olympic Club game last Sat
urday, it was revealed.
Seized Near Stadium
The wholesale plot was disclosed
following the arrest last Saturday
of Abraham Kilberg.
Kilberg was seized by Carl Vendt,
U.C. student in charge of ticket
sales, and his assistant, Alexander
L. Ford, as Kilberg was selling tick
ets near one of the entrances to the
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
Tickets Are Forgeries
It was at first believed the tickets
had been stolen. But when they
were examined closely by W. W.
Monohan, graduate manager for the
Associated Students of the Univer
sity of California, he detected that
the tickets were forgeries.
Monohan made a hasty inspection
of the ticket stubs turned in at the
gates for the Olympic Club game,
and found more than one hundred
spurious tickets similar to those
taken from Kilberg.
Recheck Started
He began a thorough check of the
Santa Clara stubs and although the
check had not been completed last
night, more than one thousand
counterfeit stubs had been found.
Monohan explained that spurious
tickets could be sold only to games
where there were no reserved seats,
so he expected to find no counter
feit tickets in the California-St.
Mary's game.
San Francisco police were asked
to aid in the investigation of the
ring, and Inspector Charles Iredale
launched a search for the printing
press on which the false tickets were
printed.
