# SISTERS STARVE AS COOK STICKS IN FLOOR PAINT
## 
### 
What is the difference be
tween slow and fast? Just two
meals, according to members
of the Alpha O house.
Deciding that the kitchen
floor looked Awful Low, the
sisters purchased and applied
a quantity of quick-drying
paint. Came the dawn and the
cook.
Resultâ€”tracks beginning at
door ending abruptly in person
of said cook marooned in mid
dle of floor, stove temptingly
in distance.
The sisters called up the
salesman. He was very apolo
getic; he had given them the
24-hour drying kind by mis
take; he hoped it wouldn't put
them out. "Oh, no, just can't
eat, that's all."
Dinner was salvaged via the
pantry window. Deciding that
groceries are the staff of life,
the house committee has post
poned further action on the
floor.
