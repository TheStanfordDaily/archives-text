# Early History Of "500" Told By G. E. Crothers
## 
### 
Just how narrowly "the 500" es-
I eaped obliteration from this campus
is related by Judge George E.
Crothers, '95, in his recently pub
' lushed outline of Stanford history.
Shortly before Mrs. Stanford re
signed from her task as surviving
i founder of the infant University, re
| ports were brought to her of "the
I number of men and women students
I alleged to have been seen promen
| ading upon the walks and drive.*:
; upon Ihe campus in the late evening
: hours."
It was in the final appearance of
| Mrs. Stanford before the Board <>f
' Trustees that the fate of the "500"
j swung by a thread. The question
lof co-education was reopened. If
! she were to leave the final decision
up to the Trustees, Mrs. Stanford
, would have had to amend the trusts
i before resigning.
Disturbed by the reports, half
hesitant, Mrs. Stanford stood think
i ing. Alarmed, Judge Crothers asked
[ for a five-minute recess, and ad-
I vised Mrs. Stanford that her fears
1 •

j were not well founded. She there-
I upon said that the trusts should be
j unchanged; and then she read her
resignation.
Mrs. Stanford's determination to
keep the University afloat is fur
i thcr revealed in Crother's story of
j her sacrifices after Senator Stan
, ford's death had placed the burden
on her shoulders.
Ten thousand dollars a month was
allowed her by the Probate Court —
the amount she had been accus
tomed to spend in household ex
penses alone, to say nothing of run
i ning a University. "She reduced her
personal retinue from seventeen to
one cook, one maid and a secretary,
writes Crothers, "and her total
household expenses to about the
j equivalent of a professor's salary.
To keep the University open she
sold at a sacrifice even her six mag
nificent strings of choice pearls,"
which money was turned over to
President Jordan who kept the Uni
versity open and in operation,
| throughout its early career.
