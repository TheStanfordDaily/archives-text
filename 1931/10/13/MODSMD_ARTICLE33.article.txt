# EMANCIPATED FEMININITY

Breaking away from Iho rules and recommendations of
the Athletic Conference of American College Women,
Stanford women have taken a definite stand for inter-class
intercollegiate sports. Since 1920, sports between Stanford,
California, and Mills have been on the basis of a friendly
interchange between classes and schools. Each school
would supply one-third of a team and the mixed teams
would plav each other. The result was a decided lack of
spirit and skill. The system was an attempt to play the
sport for sport's sake, culling out all possible school spirit
or team rivalry.
Due to the persistent efforts of Stanford's W.A.A.
Hoard, inter-class intercollegiate sports will be tried at the
next Triangular Sports Day between Stanford, California,
and Mills.
If this works out, the next step would logically seem
varsity intercollegiate sports. With a varsity team from
each school there should be created a vital interest in the
sport, making it possible to develop real skill and team
play. A certain amount of school spirit and rivalry will be
inevitable and this is frowned upon by the national asso
ciation. They claim that "it would take women still farther
away from the goal the physical educators seek the goal
of play for play's sake, and every one on the field instead
of in the grandstand."
Other arguments put forward are: "Girls are too high
strung emotionally to participate wisely in such activities.
. . . If is not a wholesome activity for a girl to enter judging
from the experiences college men go through in their var
sity competition. . . ."
More arguments lake up the "gate-receipt" question,
and this aspect seems to be the mosUbolhersome. But why
should intercollegiate sports mean commercialism? It
seems unreasonable to insist that varsity competition need
have these faults, and not make way for the advantages of
greater team co-ordination, more interested and expert
coaching, and a higher standard of performance.
If Stanford, wifh the help of California and Mills, can
illustrate by practical experience the advantages of inter
collegiate competition, Ihe A.C.A.C.W. must sit up and take
stock of its old-fashioned, prim and proper rules.
