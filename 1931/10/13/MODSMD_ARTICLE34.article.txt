# EDUCATIONAL OVERPRODUCTION
## 
### 
The Stanford School of Education reports a large in-j
crease in the enrollment of its three introductory classes!
in education over that of last year. The increase has been
so substantial that difliculty has been encountered in find-j
in/4 rooms large enough for these classes. From the State
Teachers College a! San .lose likewise comes the report of
a marked increase in enrollment.
Commonly such increases in school enrollments are en
thusiastically acclaimed as signposts of prosperity and j
progress. Hut the Stanford School of Education is not
pointing with pride at its bulging numbers.
In the face of the reported .'5,500 teachers out of employ
ment in California this year, with prospects in this field
no better and perhaps worse for the year following, the!
immediate future of those college graduates who are j
equipped only with teachers' certificates is not a bright
one. Hut the growing total of graduates so equipped indi- j
cates a deliberate blindness to or a misunderstanding of
I he present situation.
California has long been looked upon as one of the j
ideal states in which to follow the career of teaching. Col-(
lege students should wake up and realize that for them
this is no longer true. In the iirst place California is held
(he ideal place to retire in, by Eastern teachers, because
of its climate and relatively large salaries. As a result!
teachers from the East pour into this state, to do their hist
years of teaching here. With their fifteen or twenty years j
of experience, they are given preference over applicants ;
just out of college, even though the latter have obtained
certificates from a California university.
In the second place the teaching profession is incredibly ;
over-crowded. Of course the warning "over-crowded" is
not justification to keep back an individual from entering
a certain field, for all fields are exploited, and college stn- (
dents are admonished continually that "it is hard at Hit'
start, but there is plenty of room at the top." However
there is no "start" in the teaching field today.
Students, particularly women students for there is a
tendency being shown to give preference to "men appli- j
cants should open their eyes to the fact that unless they j
are unusually fortunate they will run up against the ne
cessity of finding work in some other line, for a time, or
else remaining without a position. It is only common sense
for women students to equip themselves if possible with
training on the side, along with their teacher's certificate,!
which will gain them admission, temporarily at leiisf, into
some less crowded profession or business. This is difficult.
Hut a teacher's certificate alone is not worth what if was
formerly.
