## "S.C.'s 'NOBLE EXPERIMENT' IS STARTED" 
### 
The above title—"S.C.'s 'Noble
Experiment' Is Starter"—is not the
Bull Session's; it is the one found on
a leading editorial in the Daily Tro
jan—official student publication of
the leading university south of the
Tehachapi and east of Vermont
Avenue (in Los Angeles).
It seems that the severe entrance
requirements at U.S.C. hav6 been
keeping out great numbers of de
serving students whose high-school
records were not up to 25 over par.
Consequently, 70 students will be
admitted each year for 3 years even
though deficient in the normal num
ber of recommended grades. In fact,
it seems that high-school grades
will not count at all; for many
brilliant minds, according to the edi
torial, may have been so interested
in other things that they could not
grasp specific information.
If seems to us, however, that a
"brilliant" intellect could maintain
with ease a "B" average and par
ticipate in a half dozen extra cur
ricular high-school activities. Fur
thermore, fhe mind that would
sacrifice a college education for
these extra-educational pursuits,
can hardly be classed as brilliant—
at least in the Northern Californian
understanding of the word. And
again, these suffering brilliant minds
who find ihe gates to higher learn

! ing barred against their craving to
: drink of the fountain of knowledge,
and yell themselves hoarse at foot
! ball games, can always go to Junior
j Colleges; and after a short stay
! there, wend their merry way to
| college.
! These specially admitted students
iat U.S.C., we understand, cannot
] participate in athletics; but the edi
i torial states that if in the first year
] they can achieve a "C" average, the
sophomore year finds them regu-
I larly enrolled —and eligible of course
:to play football—if that happens to
j be their desire; but, of course, these
! brilliant minds would not consider
wasting precious college time on
! such a common thing as football
! with the libraries full of wonderful
j books.
j Why U.S.C. must risk its academic
; standing in the cause of educational
| research when there are numerous
j colleges in and about Los Angeles
j that have been doing for years what
; U.S.C. is doing now is difficult to
' understand. It is common knowledge
that many schools do not require
' recommended grades at all; why
can't the experiment be carried on
in these places? In all probability,
i these struggling institutions would
; be more than delighted to have an
1 additional 70 "brilliant" minds on
'their rolls. —Abe Mellinkoff,
