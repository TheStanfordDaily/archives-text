FROM DAY TO DAY—By Ferdyn
and Goctel. Vikiiijj Press. A( the
Palo Alto Book Shop.
"From Day to Day'' is "a new and
! interesting departure in the field of
| the novel. Its author has been recog-
I nized as the dean of contemporary
Polish literature and is deservedly
t well known in Europe. This is his
I first translation into English.
A foreword by John Galsworthy
| explains the intent and method of
I the book which might otherwise be
I unintelligible. The author has made
J an interesting and expert combina
! tion of diary and straight narrative.
His hero sets out to keep a diary
and write a novel at the same time.
The novel section of the book is
| the story of the hero's experiences
j during the World War, and excerpts
! from both the novel and the diary
I are combined in such a way as to
j show the effects of his earlier ex-
I periences upon his present life. The
j whole stands out as a very realistic
S picture of life with almost photo
| graphic clearness. Goetel's method
j is the latest and perhaps the least |
j obvious of the tricks of the literary '
| trade to make this possible.
The book is characterized by an !
j ease and polish of style, thanks to ;
( the excellent translation. As is typi- j
; cal of European novels "From Day
! to Day" makes up what it lacks in '
i detail by its attention to the mental !
reactions of its characters. An ex- 1
| cellent book but not for the light '
! and frivolous reader. —S.C.A. j
STORM DRIFT—By Ethel M. Dell.
New York. G. P. Putnam and Sons.
1931.
"If you like this kind of thing you I
j will find this the kind of thing you ;
! like!"
You might as well know at the j
i beginning that the concluding chap™ i
j ter is entitled "Safe Haven." The i
j haven after the storm, catch?
Opening (he book at random I
I found the following tidbits on the
! double page:
" 'When one doesn't count any !
more—with anybody, it's silly to j
worry, isn't it?'
" 'You do count!' said Tiggie. The >
j words burst from him; he could not j
I have stopped them had a pistol been i
j held at his head."
j And, "The pathos of her wrung 1
his heart."
The story is about a young woman j
who is unworthy of the admirable |
man who falls in love with her and i
how she became worthy.
I forgot to say that the characters j

have very pretty names like Viola.
They are, in fact, as poetical as those
j in the English themes of twelve
j year-olds. —E.T.P.

HOT NEWS—By Emile Gauvreau.
Macaulay, N.Y. At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.

The former editor of a tabloid
I newspaper tells the whole story of
i the "pinkies" in the manner of the
! anonymous authors of the recent
j deluge of "ex" books.
: Written in blatantly journalistic
I style "Hot News" becomes exceed
| ingly boring after the interesting
; points of the first three chapters are
J repeated chapter after chapter.
Most of the facts of the story are
1 apparently true, the author hardly
I bothering to change the names of
j the principal characters.
"Hot News" throws an interesting
| light on the particular phase of
| journalistic history which was char-
I acterized by the meteoric rise of
! the tabloid sheets, but as a novel
| even its sensationalism is dulled to
j the point of boredom by intermin
| able repetition. —S.C.A.
