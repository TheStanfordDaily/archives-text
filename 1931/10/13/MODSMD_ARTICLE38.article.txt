ANAMOLY
(Willi some necessary apologies
to Joyce Kilmer)
I think that I shall never see
A thing as strange as Kilmer's tree.
A tree which stands up straight and
fair
To shield the robins in its hair.
But now its face drops on its breast,
lis mouth against the earth is presl.
A new shape still it must display,
It lifts its leafy arms to pray
And then falls hack upon the plain
To let its bosom catch the rain.
That poems are made by fools like
me
Is shown by Kilmer's dizzy tree.
Wc met E. Ilemingway-Botts the
other night at dinner, and like
everyone else, wondered where he
had acquired his massive knowledge
He knew everything. All the debu
tantes gathered around him, and he
was easily the hit of the evening.
Obviously he wasn't a Delmar Dub
bard's notebook man, for there were
two of those at the table continu
ally giving themselves away by ut
tering the same phrase. Nor was he
a fifteen minutes a day boy, for he
knew football rules as well as the
classics.
Ws asked him about it after din
ner.
"It isn't, a guitar under your nap
kin, or a magnetized personality?"
"No," he replied. "When I was
just out of high school I decided T
would make something of myself.
I resolved to do things. Then one
day an ad in a magazine attracted
my attention, and I sent in the
coupon at once. From then it was
easy. I merely "
"Yes? "
"I merely went four years to Har
vard, three to Oxford, two to the
Sorbonne, and am now doing re
search work at Stanford."
