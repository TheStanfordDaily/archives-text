# Schissler Sees Chance To Upset Stanford
## Indian First Team Lineup Still Unsettled; Hand Threatens Grey 
### L. M. C 
"I think we can take 'em!"
That's what Paul Schissler, head
man at Oregon State, remarked to a
local official alter the Stanford-
Minnesota game Saturday. And ho
didn't mean Minnesota.
Schissler always lays for the
Indians, last year giving them a
bad scare in a 111 to 7 game.
Now, with one of the most pow
erful squads on the coast, he
thinks the time has come.
It is true that the Oregon Staters
took a 30 to 0 beating at the hands
of Southern California, but John
Bunn, who saw the game, repo> ts it
was "just one of those days" for
the Northerners.
"fop" Warner further points
out that it was a hot day, al
ways a handicap Co northern
elevens. "Our scouts report that
Schissler has the best material,
with the possible exception of
U.S.C., of any team in the con
ference," Warner toid the writer
yesterday. "I look for Oregon
State to give us a real batttle."
And when you consider that the
Oregon line which will start Satur
day outweighs even the hefty Min
nesota line, averaging 200 pounds
FROM END TO END; that Schissler
has definitely pointed for the game,
.scheduling no contest for last v/eek;
that the game will be the second of
three successive hard tjlts for Stan
fordâ€”it would appear that Satur
day's affair will be no picnic.
