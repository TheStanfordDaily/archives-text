Because he has so many men of
apparently equal ability at several
posts, Warner is not ready yet to
announce a permanent first team.
Ernie Cadclel probably estab
lished himself as a fixture at
right hall in the Gopher clash,
and Allen at fullback by virtue
of his passing, but other doubt
ful positions are still hanging
fire.
"Pop" doesn't consider the quar
terback problem settled, with Baker
and Rintala pressing Captain Harry
Hillman for his post. "I thought
Hillnum did well against Santa
Clara," Warner said, "but I didn't
think he looked so good Saturday."
Warner also indicated that George
Grey, when he recovers from in
juries received in the Bronco tilt,
may have a hard time getting his
tackle post away from "Red" Hand,
who performed so brilliantly against
the Gophers. On the other hand,
Gribben has a chance to displace
Ehrhorn when his leg injury heals,
according to "Pop."
The guard situation, particu
larly on the left side, is still
unsettled, with several good
men about 011 a par. At center,
Warner considers that Milligan
has a slight edge over the field,
which includes Marks, Kite, and
Johnson. The latter, a transfer
from Modesto Junior College,
may be given a chance in Sat
urday's game.
Even the veteran Neill is not se
cure at left end, the Old Man con
sidering him no better than a stand
off with Colvin. Tod will undoubt
edly get the call at right end Satur
day.
