# Card Frosh Meet Bakersfield Jaysee Saturday
## BRADSHAW HOLDS HEAVY WORKOUTS IN BABE PRACTICE Bakersfield Frosh Tussle To Precede Varsity Tilt; Bowles Returns 
### Francis Hamilton 
Bakersfield Junior College will
meet Stanford's freshman football
squad next Saturday as the pre
liminary to the Oregon State-var
sity fracas. Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
will work his men hard this week
in an endeavor to keep them at the
same pilch as they played the last
half of their game against U.C.L.A.
In the second and third quarters
of that unhappy affair the Card
babes looked like a TEAM that was
going somewhere in a hurry. Play
ing that midfield form consistently,
they would be world beaters.
U.C.L.A.'s forward wall was exactly
as heavy as advertised, and some of
their men looked aged enough to be
competing for varsity jobs.
Center proved to be the weak
point of the Stanford defense, with
Semmclroth and Van Kirk seated
on the sidelines through injuries.
Half Well Filled
One bright spot is the return to
practice sessions of Bowles, stellar
half. With Rothert and Bowles both
competing for this position, Brad
shad should have few headaches
about replacements at this strategic
post. Moore, Flannagan, and Seaver
are all rugged men and with a little
luck they should last out the season
as a unit. We make this casual re
mark accompanied with a lusty
smack on the mahogany, though.
Durkee also returns to the active
list this week to find a formidable
contestant for his position in the
shape of Abrahamson, 190 pounder.
The latter lacks Durkee's potential
threat as a forward passer, though,
and as yet has shown little inclina
tion to star on the receiving end of
the aerial attempts.
U.C. Cubs Face S.C.
The California Cubs receive their
first acid test this coming week-end
when they tangle with U.S.C.'s
babes. From all reports, the Cali
fornia yearlings have the class of
this section, with a big fast line and
some powerful backs. They .were
impressive against Oneonta Military
Academy who are held in high re
pute in the southern part of the
state.
Southern California will afford a
stiff workout for the Berkeley
eleven, if their play against Comp
ton Junior College, whom they de
feated 13 to 0 Saturday, is any in
dication of their possibilities. Comp
ton J.C.. it will be remembered, was
outstanding among California junior
colleges last year.
