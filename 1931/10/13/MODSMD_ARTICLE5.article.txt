# WOMEN STUDENTS TO SELL CHAPPIES THURSDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Chaparral's opening number for
this year will appear on Tuesday
morning. Boh de√üoos, circulation
manager, urges all women students
who wish to sell Chaparrals on the
Quad to either get in touch with
him at the Chaparral office or else
report to him Thursday morning at
the Engineering corner at any time
from 8 o'clock until noon.
Every girl who sells Chaparrals
will be given a free copy of the
magazine. At the end of the year a
silver cup will be presented to the
girl who has sold the most copies.
Last year's cup was presented to
Marie Baker. The house in which
the members have sold the most
magazines will be given a bound
volume containing all the numbers
for the year.
