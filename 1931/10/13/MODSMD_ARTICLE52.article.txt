# JACK SHARKEY DEBUNKS CARNERO MYTH IN GREAT 15-ROUND FRAY AT BROOKLYN

### 
EBBETT'S FIELD, BROOKLYN, !
S N.Y., Oct. 12 (/P). — The myth of
Primo Camera's invincibility was I
blasted wide tonight by Jack Shar
key, stormy petrel of the heavy- j
weight lists, in one of the greatest j
j 15 - round duels the faithful have i
I seen since the last of the Tunney- ;
I Dempsey storm scenes in Chicago i
| five years ago.
i While 30,000 chilled spectators,
[ muffled in overcoats, roared from j
the stands and benches of the Na- j
I tional League ball yard, Sharkey
| came back to smash his way to a
j one-sided decision as he plastered
| the giant with every bit of fistic i
! punishment one man can inflict on !
j another.
He floored the huge Italian in the
i fourth round, and left him wobbling,
i starry-eyed, a huge robot with arms
j frozen in the position of defense at j
1 the final bell.
The result of the bout was never
' in doubt.

NEW YORK, Oct. 12. — Primo
Camera tipped the scales at 261
pounds when he weighed in for his
15-round bout with Jack Sharkey,
of Boston ; at Ebbets Field, Brooklyn,
tonight.
The Italian man-mountain had a
weight pull of 58\z pounds over
Sharkey, who weighed 202V2- It war
the lightest Primo ever has weighed
for a fight in this country.
The reserved seat sale for the
fight reached $50,000 at noon. Pro
moter James Johnston reported he
was hopeful that a last minute rush
would bring the gross to about
$150,000.
Dr. Joseph S. Baldwin, who ex
amined the fighters, found them
both in excellent physical condi
tion, especially Sharkey. He said
there was no trace of the two in

juries suffered by the tar in train- 1
ing—a sore "pinkie" on the left hand j
and a wound on the scalp sustained j
when Sharkey was butted by a ;
sparring partner.
The blood pressure of both gladi
ators was normal. Camera's was j
126 over 75 and Sharkey's 122 over i
75. |
Sharkey tried to disconcert the j
Venetian giant with his famous -
"hypnotic glare." The results were •
unsuccessful. Camera stared back ;
at the temperamental tar with such
intensity that Sharkey was the first j
to drop his eyes.
When Camera was being exam- j
ined, Sharkey remarked: "I think
he looks nervous."
At weighing-in time Sharkey was !
a slight favorite in the betting.
