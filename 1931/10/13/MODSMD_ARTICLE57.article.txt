# BAR EXAMINATION FAILS TO DEFEAT LOCAL GRADUATES
## Eighteen Pass August Test At San Francisco; Six At Los Angeles 
### 
Carrying on the tradition of near
perfection since results were tabu
lated sonic three years ago, an even
two dozen of last year's graduates
from the Stanford School of Law
passed the August bar examinations
held in San Francisco and Los An
geles with almost 100 per cent of
the Cardinal tryoutees for the title
of counsellor-at-law successful in
their three-year quest, it was re
vealed yesterday.
For the first time in its history
the Committee of Bar Examiners in
California announced the number of
repeaters and the percentage - of
these who had passed. But, accord
ing to Dr. M. R. Kirkwood, dean of
the Stanford law school, there was
little need for information here.

"We are not interested in knowing
who repeated their tries at success
fully passing the bar examinations,"
Dean Kirkwood said yesterday in
commenting upon the bar returns,
"because better than nine out of ten
in the law school get by.
"Only 44 per cent of the total
number from all the law schools in
California successfully pass the bar
examinations," Professor Kirkwood
explained. "Our passing average is
more than twice that. In the last
six examinations, since these sta
tistics were first kept, including this
one in August, more than 90 per
cent of the law school graduates
passed."

"We are not interested in knowing
who repeated their tries at success
fully passing the bar examinations,"
Dean Kirkwood said yesterday in
commenting upon the bar returns,
"because better than nine out of ten
in the law school get by.
"Only 44 per cent of the total
number from all the law schools in
California successfully pass the bar
examinations," Professor Kirkwood
explained. "Our passing average is
more than twice that. In the last
six examinations, since these sta
tistics were first kept, including this
one in August, more than 90 per
cent of the law school graduates
passed."
