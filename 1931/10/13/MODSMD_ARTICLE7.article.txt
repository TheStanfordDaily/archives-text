### 
"An Archaeological Tour of Medi
terranean Lands" will be the sub
ject of an illustrated lecture to be
given by Professor H. R. Fairelough
tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
For the past two years, Professor
Fairelough has been traveling and
studying archaeology. His trip began
in June 1929 when he visited Eng
land and Spain. Th? rest of the
time was spent in such counties as
Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and Italy,
where he visited cities of archaeo
logical interest and met contempor
ary students of antiquities.

While he was in Italy last Sep
tember and October, he was invited
by the Italian Minister of Education
to accompany the Virgilian Cruise
organized by the Royal Academy
of Italy. This cruise, which was the
Italian government's recognition of
the 2,000 th anniversary of Virgil's
birth, took them to points of archae
ological interest in Albania, southern
Italy, and Sicily. The cruise was
terminated on Virgil's birthday, Oc
tober 15. In Albania, the members
of the party were the first outsiders
to visit Virgilian sites which were
recently excavated.
During the past two winters, Fair
clough has spent much time in
Rome working in the Vatican li
brary on Virgilian manuscripts. He
was presented to the King and
Queen of Ita'y during his stay there
