# CRACK CHURCH SAFE BUT LEAVE VALUABLES
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 12. (/P) â€”
Robbers today entered the basement
of "Old Pine" Presbyterian Church,
one of the oldest churches in the
country, blew the safe, and left
empty-handed after strewing rec
ords over the floor.
Four silver communion plates
which have been used at services for
more than 100 years, were taken
from the safe but left on the floor.
The plot occupied by the church
was donated by Richard and Thomas
Penn in 1764.
