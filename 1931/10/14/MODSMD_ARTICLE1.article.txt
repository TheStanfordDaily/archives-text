ing "Down with the church!"

The action of the Assembly today
breaks a tradition of centuries dur
ing which church authority has

Alfonso XIII, that, under a repub
lic, church and state would be sep
arated completely.
The galleries and corridors of the
Assembly hall were packed as the
debate began over the substitution
of the provision finally adopted for
the original proposal, which was
much more drastic.

provided that they might be ejected
for "just cause."
There is also a provision for the
dissolution of orders which have
special authorities "conflicting with
the state." Catholic deputies char
acterized this amendment as aimed
against the Jesuits particularly.
