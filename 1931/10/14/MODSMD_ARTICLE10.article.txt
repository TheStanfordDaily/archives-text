# COUNTERFEIT TICKET AGENCIES PROMISE STANFORD TROUBLE
## 
### 
There is only one way to avoid
the counterfeit football ticket peril,
declared Alfred E. Masters, general
manager of the Board of Athletic
Control, yesterday, and that is to
warn the public against buying from
other than authorized agencies.
Masters admitted that Stanford
was in danger of trouble from the
recently discovered counterfeit ring
operating among several of the
northern California stadiums, but
said that the B.A.C. had so far
found no counterfeit stubs.
The Big Game presents the great
est danger, however, as the tickets,
being worth $5 each, offer a greater
reward to the counterfeiter than
any other stadium contest. It is not
likely, however, that rooters' card
bcards will be falsified, as this
would necessitate the possession of
the official B.A.C. stamp across the
ticket.
Even if the duplication criminals
did get to work, the B.A.C. would
not be the loser, as all seats would
have been sold beforehand anyway,
and the only result would be a few
decreased pocketbooks in the cus
tomers' hands.
