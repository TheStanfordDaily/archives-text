# A. F. OF L. REAFFIRMS GOMPERS' PRINCIPLE

VANCOUVER, 8.C., Oct. 13. (/P) j
â€”Timely reference to the farewell j
message of the late Samuel Gom- j
pers, president of the American J
Federation of Labor from its found- j
ing until his death in 1924, turned ;
an incipient crisis into a reaffirma- j
tion of the first principles of the
organized labor movement in its :
convention here today.
Bristling with troublesome poten- ;
tialities since the A.F.L. convened j
here last week, a resolution which
asked amendment of the Federation
constitution to make affiliation of
crafts with their respective depart
ments mandatory, was shelved by
the convention without a dissenting
vote. The unanimity of the conven- |
tion occasioned some surprise as the '
resolution provoked fiery debate
when it was being prepared by the |
Building Trades department at its
prc-convention caucus.
