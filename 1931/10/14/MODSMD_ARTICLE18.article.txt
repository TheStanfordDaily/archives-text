### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. (/P) â€”
| With Congressional approval prob
| ably necessary, President Hoover's
j proposed move to strengthen rail
-1 road bonds and, indirectly, small
! savings banks may be deferred for
j some time.
The Chief Executive and his ad
| visers have been giving intensive
,study to several approaches to the
| problem, but no plan has been
j evolved yet.
Among those which ho has con
| sidered is a proposal for a revolving
fund from which loans could be
j made to the carriers. The fund
j would comprise both private and
| government capital.
