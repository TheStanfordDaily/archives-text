# Fairclough Leads Word-Picture Trip To Europe
## 
### 
Stepping stones of archaeology— [
Syria, Palestine, Corinth, and Ur— j
marked the path of Tuesday eve- j
j ning's lecture last night by Dr. j
Henry H. Fairclough, former pro- j
fessor in the Department of Classical
Literature, and now professor emer- i
| itus, who spoke on a recent archaeo- '
logical tour of Mediterranean lands. j
The nations of the world are in j
league in archaeological projects; j
and Americans, says Dr. Fairclough, |
arc conspicuous for their industry j
in excavation and research through- j
i out the Mediterranean.
! American excavators have recent- j
ly uncovered in Corinth "a rare j
| treasure trove" of coins and jewelry j
1 dating from Philip of Macedon and |
i Alexander the Great.

| As a member of the Virgilian 1
| cruise, to commemorate • the 2,000 th
I anniversary of Virgil's death, Fair
! clough visited the principal archaeo- i
j logical sites of Italy. Mussolin, ho
| says, is the patron of archaeology. |
Whole sections of Rome are bnitig I
I torn dow/i under his direction to '
' uncover ancient sites. Several of the |
J fora are being uncovered, and the I
; Circus Maximus further excavated. I
The Virgilian cruise took the sci- J
I entists around Sicily, pausing at j
! Syracuse to see the Greek remains, j
the theatre, and the fountain of :
I Arethusa.
Delphi he credits as the most ro
| mantic spot. The Delphic festival j
| which occurs every other year is a j
; custom revived by an American
I woman. |
