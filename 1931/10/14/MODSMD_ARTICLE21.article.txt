# TROOPS GUARD STATEHOUSE AS LONG, CYR TILT
## Rival Lousiana Governors Clash As Long Prepares To Employ Force 
### 
BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 13. (/P)
I â€”With highway policemen guarding
! the capitol ancj the governor's man
| sion, and state troops assembled in
j the background, Huey P. Long and
Paul N. Cyr, Governor and Lieuten-
I ant-Governor, respectively, were iri
| dispute toriight over who is Gov
ernor of Louisiana.
On the claim that Long vacated
the governor's office when he certi
fied his election to the United States
Senate last November, Cyr today
went before a deputy clerk of the
District Court at Shreveport and
took the oath as Governor and pub
licly announced he was Governor
under the constitution and not Long.
Long Disputes Action
Apprised of Cyr's action at his
New Orleans hotel, Long said when
i Cyr took the Governor's oath he
automatically ceased to be Lieuten
ant-Governor or a state officer
I Long ordered his automobile and
| started for Baton Rouge.
While the Governor was speeding
! toward the capital, a unit of the
Baton Rouge National Guard began
i to assemble on the Community Club
grounds there.
Police Guard Capitol
Squads of state highway police
men with side arms took up posi-
I tions at the entrances to the State
Capitol and the Governor's Mansion.
Commanders of either force would
j not say what the reason was for the
movement but it was generally re
garded as meaning that Long was
prepared to hold the office of Gov-
J ernor by force if necessary.
Captain W. J. B. Hawthorne said
orders for mobilization of the Com
pany of 67 men "came from New
Orleans" with no reason assigned
1 except that they should assemble
as "quickly as possible."
Troops Held Ready
Hearing of the troop mobilization,
Cyr telegraphed the State Adjutant
i General over his signature as "Gov
j ernor and Commander-in-Chief of
the Louisiana National Guard" or
dering him to disband the company
that he understood had been called
out by "Ex-Governor Long" and to
let the courts decide the dispute.
As night fell the troops still were
assembled and resting on their arms
to await orders from Long.
