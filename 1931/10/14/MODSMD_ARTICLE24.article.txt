# Practice Shows Varsity's Skill In Aerial Play
## Warner Stresses Penetration of O.S.C. Pass Denfense; Session Unique in that Saturday's Team Remains Intact as First String Outfit PRESENT ELEVEN ENDURES UNUSUAL FIRE Injury Toll Comparatively Easy on Indians but Loss Comes Where It Hurts Most 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
AIR-MINDED REDSKINS continued to fill the air with pigskins in
practice yesterday afternoon, further strengthening the belief that
Saturday s tussle with the beefy Beavers from Oregon State will be quite
some aerial show. Warner devoted a goodly part of the workout to direct
ing all his backs and ends in a sort of dummy scrimmage against O.S.C.
pass defense. And a sufficient number of the tosses were connecting to

-'hint trouble for the visitors Satur
day, even though their line doe*
average 200 pounds from end to end.
Rudy Rintala, still somewhat in
I the dark about fullback assignments,
| demonstrated another good reason
; for his being shifted from half to
1 that position. Long or short, passes
j tha; left Rudy's hands hit their
i marks with surprising regularity.
This week's practice session, thus
j far, at least, has been unique for
i the 1931 season in that the Icam
| which started the Saturday gamo
i has remained intact as the number
1 outfit. That is, it has, with the
exception of Hillman and Moffatt,
who were held out at the opening
of the Gopher contest.
Colvin and Tod remain at ends,
j Hand and Ehrhorn are the tackles,
Corbus and Bigelow guards, Mil Ii
! gan is at center, while the backfield
| continues with Allen at full, MofTatt
: and Caddel, halves, and Captain
j Harry Hillman at quarter.
Whether or not the battle for
j first-string positions is still going
j on, Pop did not say, but most likely
I it is.
New Talent Appears
This year has seen more upsets
I staged by men given little chance
j at the start of the season than ever
j before, and the shakeups seem to
have produced results. No one can
i deny that the present eleven is
i showing a lot more early season firr
j than has been the in years
past.
The injury toll has been com
paratively easy on the Indians as
far as the number of men hurt is
j concerned. It picked few men, but
j has taken them where the losi,
j hurts most.
While George Grey will probably
be back in a suit before the end of
the week, Ned Clark and Red Grib
ben will not. It is not likely that
these two latter victims will see any
: action for the remainder of the
i season.
Tod Cinches End
Clark and Gribben were just two
i more of the boys who blasted their
1 way through a lot of veterans early
this fall. They had a lot of fight and
j were serious threats to outshine all
j others at their positions.
| They were the same scrapping
i variety as Tod, the newcomer who
i shoved aside veteran talent to be
| come a permanent fixture at right
end.
j Fight, above all things, is what
! Warner teams have needed for
' years. They seem to have had
i everything else every season, but
not until 1931 have they demon
| strated the go-getting spirit that
supplies the spark to good material
! and excellent coaching.
That, fans, is why we predict this
to be a Big Red Year. And look out,
Trojans!

AIR-MINDED REDSKINS continued to fill the air with pigskins in
practice yesterday afternoon, further strengthening the belief that
Saturday s tussle with the beefy Beavers from Oregon State will be quite
some aerial show. Warner devoted a goodly part of the workout to direct
ing all his backs and ends in a sort of dummy scrimmage against O.S.C.
pass defense. And a sufficient number of the tosses were connecting to

-'hint trouble for the visitors Satur
day, even though their line doe*
average 200 pounds from end to end.
Rudy Rintala, still somewhat in
I the dark about fullback assignments,
| demonstrated another good reason
; for his being shifted from half to
1 that position. Long or short, passes
j tha; left Rudy's hands hit their
i marks with surprising regularity.
This week's practice session, thus
j far, at least, has been unique for
i the 1931 season in that the Icam
| which started the Saturday gamo
i has remained intact as the number
1 outfit. That is, it has, with the
exception of Hillman and Moffatt,
who were held out at the opening
of the Gopher contest.
Colvin and Tod remain at ends,
j Hand and Ehrhorn are the tackles,
Corbus and Bigelow guards, Mil Ii
! gan is at center, while the backfield
| continues with Allen at full, MofTatt
: and Caddel, halves, and Captain
j Harry Hillman at quarter.
Whether or not the battle for
j first-string positions is still going
j on, Pop did not say, but most likely
I it is.
New Talent Appears
This year has seen more upsets
I staged by men given little chance
j at the start of the season than ever
j before, and the shakeups seem to
have produced results. No one can
i deny that the present eleven is
i showing a lot more early season firr
j than has been the in years
past.
The injury toll has been com
paratively easy on the Indians as
far as the number of men hurt is
j concerned. It picked few men, but
j has taken them where the losi,
j hurts most.
While George Grey will probably
be back in a suit before the end of
the week, Ned Clark and Red Grib
ben will not. It is not likely that
these two latter victims will see any
: action for the remainder of the
i season.
Tod Cinches End
Clark and Gribben were just two
i more of the boys who blasted their
1 way through a lot of veterans early
this fall. They had a lot of fight and
