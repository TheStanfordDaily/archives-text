BERLIN, Oct. 13. (A 3 )â€” Police
were out in force when Chancellor
Heinrich Bruening laid down his
program of government today at Ihc
opening session of the Reichstag, in ;
which the Nationalists and National- '
Socialists disdained to participate j
and the Communists took part by i
shouting angry interruptions.
To guard against riots similar to j
the window-smashing outbursts that I
marked the opening of the legisla- !
ture last fall, the Reichstag building j
was a stronghold protected by mo- |
torized guards and by foot patrols.
The precautions were successful.
Hissed by Reds
The National-Socialists (Niizis) j
and the Nationalists, who have made ]
common cause for the purpose of ;
bringing about the downfall of the |
Bruening government, were rcpre- |
sented at the Reichstag proceedings j
only by observers.
The main body of their forces re
mained in lobbies and committee
rooms while the Chancellor, disre
garding the hisses and shouts of the I
Communists, pledged his govern- !
ment to two salient points:
Seek Debt Solution
No let-up in the foreign policy j
of conciliation.
Definite settlement of the question
of political debts, to eliminate the
uncertainty which "alone continu
ously halts international economic j
and financial interchange."
