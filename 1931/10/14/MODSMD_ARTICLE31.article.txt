# FOR EVERY STANFORD WOMAN

### 
Willi 111 < * distractions and confusion of the opening
weeks of the quarter subsiding somewhat, freshman
women and new women at Stanford have an opportunity
now to look around and to gain their hearings. In the
process of this to many of them comes the question, "How
does one get in the swim?"
Some with delinile talents and definite goals will choose
the journalistic or dramatic fields of university activity.
But others—and these are in the majority are hesitating.
Thev feel that they do not have the time for the intensive
outside work demanded in the-above fields. Or perhaps
they may feel that they do not possess the specialized abil
ity. Yet they are unwilling to miss the contacts, the stimu
lation and the broadening influences alVorded by partici
pation in an activity.
This year the Y.W.G.A. has an answer to that problem,
in the form of its new slogan: '"An activity for every fresh
man woman." The Y.W.G.A. has fifteen committees, relat
ing to social, business, and cultural interests. The fresh
man woman who joins one of these committees will have
interesting work to do, and projects to develop (which will
not consume too much of her leisure), and along with this
she cannot fail to make a wider circle of friends thereby.
Most important of all she has a chance to place herself,
and to put an added importance on her being at college,
by becoming a significant cog in the whole machinery of
worthwhile,, constructive campus activity.
