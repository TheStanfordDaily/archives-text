One step farther in the co-operative movement nse<l by
I lie fraternities and sororities in the purchase of supplies
would he the installation of a central accounting system
which would put all the houses on a sound financial basis.
it has been known for many years that the Administra
tion has centered its objection to the fraternity and soro
rity system around the financial condition of the various
houses. To place living group finances in business-like
form would break the back of any movement to eliminate
sororities and fraternities from the campus.
Should (his system be installed, it should come from
(he houses themselves, with no University interference.
The powers of administration should be vested in a finance
committee consisting of member or members from each
house.
Another advantage in the central system would result
in a definite saving to the houses over and above the saving
(hat would accrue from (he operation of a monthly finan
cial statement. II is logical to believe thai $15 from each
house would hire a competent accountant and an office
assistant and assuming that the average house bill for
room and board is $50 per month, $35 per month is saved
each house on (he room and board which is given the
house manager for his services.
The objection of. the national officers of a fraternity to
a central system could be met bv continuing to handle
funds for national dues and the like through the individual
houses. #
The matter is one that will have to be handled with a
great deal of care, bo(h in the manner of procedure and
in (lie selection of the accountant. It is in the province of
the fraternities and sororities alone and it is fitting that
they should undertake the organization at once.
