# GET ON THE HAND WAGON
## 
### 
This morning ;it 9 o'clock in the Assembly Ilall will he
held the annual activities assembly, a function primarily
for freshmen and other new students. The president of
the A.A.S.I*., the editor of the Daily, and the major sports
captains will talk on their various fields of endeavor.
This assembly no freshman can afford to miss. If he
or she has already chosen a particular activity in which to
specialize, the assembly will still be of interest in explain
ing the workings, methods, and aims of the different or
ganizations which form the very essence of university life.
Hut it is to the freshman who has not yet chosen his
special interest that the assembly will have the greatest
appeal. It is necessary for each individual upon entering
the I'niversity to pick out for himself sonic'extra-cnrricu
lar activity in which to enter if he expects to get the full
benefit from his university life and he must do this his first
year if he hopes to obtain any results in his chosen field.
Whether this assembly will direct him into any such
activity or not, it will at least point out the way and the
indivi'dual may take the blame on himself if he fails to
follow. ,

What this campus needs is a system of sign-posts point
inthe wav lo President Hoover's home.
