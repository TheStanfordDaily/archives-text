# BULL SESSION
## COLLEGIATE, COLLEGIATE—RAH! RAH! RAH! 
### 
It was a dark night and out of
Encina stalked three figures —
swelled with pride—and carrying
some red paint. Furtively, probably,
they hurried to the Law Steps; and
there they perpetrated their origi
nality—"To Hell With '34"; not con
tent with this, one of the party con
ceived the brilliant notion of mak
ing their project more noticeable
by the arrow cutting the steps in
two.
These nocturnal painters then
eased themselves* back to Encina—
smoked a cigar perhaps—and com
plimented themselves on how col
legiate they had been. Wouldn't the
campus be surprised? Wouldn't that
show up the sophomores? I guess
the Class of '35 is pretty good all
light! Then off to happy dreams
how Joe Zilch scores in the last
minute against the traditional rival
with a 99-yard run—is carried off
the field to the waiting arms of the
Dean's daughter—whom he takes to
the big prom—and is the campus
hero ever after. ,
If those overgrown high-school
seniors that smeared that red- paint
in front of the Law Steps think they
are collegiate, it is about time they
stopped reading College Humor and
learned that a university is not all
Universal Pictures claim it is. Stan
ford has its Encina Hall and in it
a certain amount of rough-house
and rah-rah stuff is tolerated and
accepted. But for students to push
this rah-rahism from Encina to the
Law Steps is certainly a breach
against Stanford spirit; and a mani
festation of extreme poor taste.
If those freshman smearers want
ed to surprise the campus, they suc
ceeded. The action by the present
sophomore class when they were
frosh in decorating the law steps

was considered one of those things j
like the election of a Democratic i
President—something strange and i
! unexplainable that happens once in j
I a decade. But for the present clasp |
! to follow Us predecessor, makes the !
j Student body wonder if Stanford;
| is degenerating into one of those I
j Harold Teen —hey, hey—beeg strong
j man—little honey sort of places that j
| are called institutions of higher j
learning because their football !

j wg- I
It is not possible to expect the J
! painters to risk detection and re- 1
| move the paint themselves. It is i
| possible, however, for the frosh to !
' organize and with some turpentine j
remove that red blot from their j
I name. If they think that "To Hell j
I With '34" on the law steps is it dis- [
I grace to the sophomore class, the ,
j frosh are mistaken. With two dollars
j worth of paint and several gallons
! worth of disregard, the sophonicres !
J could paint ''To Hell With '35" all
over this campus; but their doing j
{ so would not reflect on anyone but j
! themselves.
It is sincerely hoped that the j
I freshman class of this year will defi
i nitely take a stand for the true ]
j collegiate spirit and fight all at- j
I tempts of a few in their midst to i
| brand their group as a typical bunch I
lof small-town freshmen who can't |
I read the score; and who when they j
!do read it, invariably start from |
| light to left.
The sophomore class deserves j
! praise for not retaliating with simi
| lar tactics. The campus should pride 1
i itself, the writer supposes, that the j
I Class of '34 did not rise in collegiate j
! indignation and paint their epithet j
; against the frosh on the Memorial I
1 Church. —Abe Mellinkoff.

It was a dark night and out of
Encina stalked three figures —
swelled with pride—and carrying
some red paint. Furtively, probably,
they hurried to the Law Steps; and
there they perpetrated their origi
nality—"To Hell With '34"; not con
tent with this, one of the party con
ceived the brilliant notion of mak
ing their project more noticeable
by the arrow cutting the steps in
two.
These nocturnal painters then
eased themselves* back to Encina—
smoked a cigar perhaps—and com
plimented themselves on how col
legiate they had been. Wouldn't the
campus be surprised? Wouldn't that
show up the sophomores? I guess
the Class of '35 is pretty good all
light! Then off to happy dreams
how Joe Zilch scores in the last
minute against the traditional rival
with a 99-yard run—is carried off
the field to the waiting arms of the
Dean's daughter—whom he takes to
the big prom—and is the campus
hero ever after. ,
If those overgrown high-school
seniors that smeared that red- paint
in front of the Law Steps think they
are collegiate, it is about time they
stopped reading College Humor and
learned that a university is not all
Universal Pictures claim it is. Stan
ford has its Encina Hall and in it
a certain amount of rough-house
and rah-rah stuff is tolerated and
accepted. But for students to push
this rah-rahism from Encina to the
Law Steps is certainly a breach
against Stanford spirit; and a mani
festation of extreme poor taste.
If those freshman smearers want
