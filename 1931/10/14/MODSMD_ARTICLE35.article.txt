AMBROSE !lOLT AND FAMILY—
By Susan Glaspcll. New York.
Frederick A. Stokes Company.
1931.
Ambrose Holt, be it understood, is
a combination of Babbie, who twist
ed Barrie's "little minister" around
her little finger, and Bernard Shaw.
He is a man with an exceptionally
keen \mderstanding of people and
life. He is charming, witty, and
enormously wise—much too wise,
perhaps. But, and this is the rub,
Susan Glaspell makes him a totally
irresponsible character, an utterly
unsocial being. He is a family lia
bility and a public disgrace. Holt,
the editor of the town paper, walks
out on his wife and small son. It
isn't for another woman that he
does it but just to see what will
happen.
Of course all this makes most de
lightful reading. One wonders just
how possible it is for Holt to be an
intelligent man and yet lack the
ordinary quality of balance. From
time to time it makes one doubi the
infallibility of our changeless social
requirements: service, order, stand
ardization, and responsibility.
The book does not have such a
revolutionary effect on one as this
would lead him to think because
Ambrose Holt dies without leaving
any visible imprint on the world.
All one's dubious thoughts clear
away. He may sit peacefully and,
looking into the fire in ihe grate,
meditate on the absurdity of suicide
and income taxes. —E.T.P.
BROTHERS IN THE WEST—By
Robert Raynoids. New York. Har
per & Brothers. 1931.
Accustomed as we are 'to the over
production of, "Harold Bell Wright
ousness" and "Zane Grace"' this
really good treatment of the West
ern theme is a refreshing surprise.
It reminds me of the appearance of
"Journey's End" after all the tire
some war melodrama.
The two brothers, Charles and
David, are adventurei's in the pio
neer days of the West. They do not,
however, follow the accepted make
of adventurer. The banker at one
of the towns where they stopped
summed Ihem up:
"He wondered where they had
come from, and David admitted that
they had found their gold at ihe
foot of the rainbow.
" 'Well, I can't blame you for not
telling, the banker said, looking at

the great fellows more closely. For
the first time he seemed to realize
that these large-framed brothers
were not common men. The thought
crossed his mind that gold was not
congruous to their needs. Their
homely, weather-stung faces gave
him an uneasy feeling that he was
fulfilling his life on a trivial plane.
. . . . Upon second thought, he de
cided these brothers must be sim
ple-hearted fools if they knew
where much gold was and took so
little of it." Thoy were looking for
adventure and not gold.
Charles and David travel on and
now and then others join them
Such others as Esteban, Karin. Isa
bela, Jasper, and Padre Llorente
follow the leadership of the two
brothers. Nationality makes no dif
ference since they are seeking the
same goal. They enjoy each other's
companionship and this turns cut
to be the goal in itself.
This is the author's first book and
it was awarded the Harper prire.
This is especially remarkable since
Mr. Raynolds is only 29 old.
