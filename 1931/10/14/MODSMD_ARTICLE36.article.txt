It's taken three days to work up
courage, but we've finally risen to
the point of demanding: "Why those
peculiar white numerals for the
feets ball team, last Saturday?" Now
white is very pleasing to look at,
but when a man makes a spectacu-
lar play, it's nice to know whether
you should congratulate the Fijis,
the Zetes, or the Dekes. Give 'em
red numerals to match their fiery
personalities, and we'll crow with
you.

Roble admits to the rest of the
campus that it's open season on
scalp-hunting, with the first
jolly-up of the quarter taking
place tonight. Statistics on the
number of innocent freshies who
will "fall hard" for the first time
in their lives, this evening,
would be interesting.
Not to disillusion the new women,
but we feel that you really should
be warned that every third man you
dance with is bound to be a Sigma
Chi. They have a Roble complex,
reinforced with bribery from sorori
ties which surround them on the
Row. We understand that the DG's
are badly in need of taking a big
class, this year. More power to the
annex!

Suggestions for university
progressive improvements, when
the gales are finished and wait
ing for another earthquake:
If all the cosmetics used by all the
( women at Stanford were put to
gether and stirred carefully, the
sophs wouldn't have to pray for
rain to make good mud to duck the
freshmen in.
| And if all the unbeatable rome
dies for unquenchable colds on the
j campus were likewise mixed to
gether and dumped on the flat by
the boat house, we might raise a
j goodly crop of mosquitoes and for
get the sneezing troubles, for
awhile.
We understand that eight of
the nineteen-odd women who are
the Health Guardians of their
respective living groups were
unable to attend their commit
tee meeting yesterday on ac
count of illness. Ho hum ....
As for the rest of the 500, they're
actually and jolly well growing up,
d'y'know what I mean? Eight times
during a quarter, now, one of the
upper 68% may stay out till mid
night, on week nights, providing that
she's very careful, remembers who
she is, what she represents, and that
even guaranteed varieties of lipstick
are sure to stain.
