It's taken three days to work up ,
I courage, but we've finally risen to ;
j the point of demanding: "Why those |
1 peculiar white numerals for the |
; feets ball team, last Saturday?" Now j
I white is very pleasing to look at, |
I but when a man makes a spectacu- j
lar play, it's nice to know whether t
! you should congratulate the Fi j is, j
I the Zetes, or the Dekes. Give 'em j
j led numerals to match their fiery |
; personalities, and we'll crow with
I you.

Ruble admits to the rest of the
i campus that it's open season on
scalp-hunting, with the first
jolly-up of the quarter taking
place tonight. Statistics on the
number of innocent freshies who
1 will "fall hard" for the first time
in their lives, this evening,
would be interesting.
Not to disillusion the new women,
i but we feel that you really should
| be warned that every third man you
dance with is bound to be a Sigma
Chi. They have a Roble complex,
reinforced with bribery from sorori
ties which surround them on the
Row. We understand that the DG's
j are badly in need of taking a big
j class, this year. More power to the
|annex!

Suggestions for university
progressive improvements, when
the gales are finished and wait
ing for another earthquake:
If all the cosmetics used by all the
( women at Stanford were put to
gether and stirred carefully, the
I sophs wouldn't have to pray for
rain to make good mud to duck the
! freshmen in.
| And if all the unbeatable rome
i dies for unquenchable colds on the
j campus were likewise mixed to
gether and dumped on the flat by
j the boat house, we might raise a
j goodly crop of mosquitoes and for
| get the sneezing troubles, for
I awhile.
We understand that eight of
the ninteen-odd women who are
the Health Guardians of their
respective living groups were
unable to attend their commit
tee meeting yesterday on ac
count of illness. Ho hum ....
, As for the rest of the 500, they're
actually and jolly well growing up,
d'y'know what I mean? Eight times
during a quarter, now, one of the
upper 68% may stay out till mid
night, on week nights, providing that
she's very careful, remembers who
she is, what she represents, and that
1 even guaranteed varieties of lipstick
are sure to stain.
