## LOOKING AHEAD

In spite of a hard game looming
for Saturday with Oregon State and
another the following week with
Washington up at Seattle, the sub
ject of the Southern California tilt
persistently comes up whenever
football is mentioned.
"How did the Trojans look
against Washington State? Say,
I would have liked to have seen
what they would have done to
St Mary's Saturday," replied
John Bunn to our query yes
terday.
"The team performed just like
a well-oiled machine. And ma
terial—Howard Jones certainly
lias it. It will take a great team
to stop those Trojans again,"
continued Bunn. who has seen
them in all their games this
year.
Meanwhile, there can be no ques
tion as to what game the Indian
eleven is being pointed for. Army,
Olympic Club, Snnta Clara, Minne
sota —all were taken in stride, with
the team showing improvement at
each appearance. Stanford will
tackle Oregon State in much the
same way, and probably Washing
ton, although both are expected to
be the hardest games on the sched
ule so far.
With U.C.L.A. providing a let
down, the Big Red Machine should
be at maximum power for the Tro
jan game on November 7 if it con
tinues to gather steam at the rate
it has so far this season.
Barring the unexpected, a
great game should result, hut
few are there who will step up
and predict an Indian victory, or
give Stanford an even break.
"We're not conceding South
ern California the game by any
means," says "Pop" Warner,
"but we would have to be at a
pe.Jc, and catch them on an off
day to win."
One observer puts it this way:
"Stanford's only chance to beat
U.S.C. is by open play and trickery.
The Trojans unquestionably have
the greater power."
