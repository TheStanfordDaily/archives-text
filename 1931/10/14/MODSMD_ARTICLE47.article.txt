# SUPPLYING THE "BIG"
## 
### 
Looking farther ahead looms a
i Big Game into which Bill Ingram
j may yet inject the "Big."' First signs
of an offense appeared in Califor
| nia's surprising 6 to 0 victory over
j the Olympic Club last week.
While the Bear win was (he
result of a fortunate pass, as in
the Santa Clara game, the In
j gram eleven gained 10H yards
from scrimmage, as against :Â»(>
1 the week previous. THAT was

the real surprise of the game.
California, having beaten the
Broncs by the same 6-0 margin that
Stanford did, and having upset an
Olympic Club eleven which held
the Indians to a scoreless tie, com
parative scores give the Bears an
edge over Stanford right now, if
that means anything.
Santa Clara players report,
however, that Stanford gave
them a much harder game than
did California, and they pre
dict the Indians should have no
great difficulty in downing the
Bears.
But that's a long time away.
