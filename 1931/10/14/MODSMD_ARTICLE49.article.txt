# Stanford Soccerites Win, 3-1, Over Spartans
## CARDINAL KICKERS DEFEAT SAN JOSE; FALK, HEARN STAR Second String Given Good Workout; Plenty Of Material Ready 
### 
Stanford yesterday defeated the
San Jose Spartans 3-1 on the home
j field. Scoring all three of their goals
j in the first half, while San Jose
! could net only one, the Stanford
! soccer varsity used the second half
as a means of trying out most of the
members on the squad.
Accounting for two of the Red
shirt goals, Captain Falk looked as
though he had regained his last sea
son's form. The Cards' third marker
was chalked up by Art Hearn, who
played a hard fast game during the
whole time he was in.
Once again Buster Holmes kept
| sailing the bull out of danger with
| his powerful defensive kicks, often
I extricating the round leather object.
I from between the legs of several
\ San Jose forwards for long drives
! up the field.
j The team as a whole showed great
i improvement over last Friday's play.
The halfbacks, one of the strongest
' points of the team, were working
j with even more smoothness than
i they have already shown, Moore
' turning in one of the most finished
} performances on the field,
j Of the substitutes who went in
i for the Redshirts, Larry Washburn,
Mac MacLellan, and Bill Mygul
; looked particularly promising. Ma
lcney is blessed with a wealth of
material so that injuries to first
| string players would not seriously
affect the efficiency of the team.

Stanford yesterday defeated the
San Jose Spartans 3-1 on the home
j field. Scoring all three of their goals
j in the first half, while San Jose
! could net only one, the Stanford
! soccer varsity used the second half
as a means of trying out most of the
members on the squad.
Accounting for two of the Red
shirt goals, Captain Falk looked as
though he had regained his last sea
son's form. The Cards' third marker
was chalked up by Art Hearn, who
played a hard fast game during the
whole time he was in.
Once again Buster Holmes kept
| sailing the bull out of danger with
| his powerful defensive kicks, often
I extricating the round leather object.
I from between the legs of several
\ San Jose forwards for long drives
! up the field.
j The team as a whole showed great
i improvement over last Friday's play.
The halfbacks, one of the strongest
' points of the team, were working
j with even more smoothness than
i they have already shown, Moore
' turning in one of the most finished
} performances on the field,
j Of the substitutes who went in
i for the Redshirts, Larry Washburn,
Mac MacLellan, and Bill Mygul
; looked particularly promising. Ma
lcney is blessed with a wealth of
material so that injuries to first
| string players would not seriously
affect the efficiency of the team.
