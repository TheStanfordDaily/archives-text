# Second String Babes To Play Bakersfield J. C.
## 
### 
Coach Jimmy Bradshuw has defi
] nitely announced that his second
| string team will open the Bakers
; field J.C. game here Saturday. Pre
ferring to risk a beating in this
relatively unimportant meeting
[ rather than stand a chance of badly
; battering some of the main cogs of
! his first team, Bradshaw has de-
I cided on this course in the interests
i of conservation of material.
I V/ith such a small stock of re
serve men on the freshman squad
I Bradshaw has ample cause for
I anxiety this year. He has a first
team of better than average
| strength, but (here is an unhappy
! difference between their ability and
i that of the second and third teams.
Semmelroth, a guard who has
been out of uniform since the Lo.s
: Angeles Junior College fray, has
I appeared in a suit this week along
J with Bowles, the fast-stepping half.
I It is unlikely that Semmelroth will
j play Saturday, but Bradshaw intiâ€”
j mated that Bowles may get in the

1 game for a few minutes. The latter
lias played very little football for
the babes to date, being injured
most of the time. The only regular
or. the injured list at present is Van
Kirk, who held down the center
position in impressive fashion in the
Los Angeles game. It is improbable
that he will even be available for
the Southern California encounter.
Coach Bradshaw is confident that
the Cardinal yearlings learned some
| expensive lessons last Saturday.
i Two bad breaks hindered them in
that first half; a fumble occurred
immediately after Seaver's brilliant
i run of 17 yards, and later a penalty
caused by nervousness made it a
first down for U.C.L.A. near the goal
line when it should have been Stan
ford's ball out on the twenty-yard
1 line. These two events were re
sponsible for the Westwoods' score
and undermined the Indians' eonfi
| dence. Coming out after the half
with the old vigor and verve they
proceeded to smash right through
i that heavy Bruin line.
