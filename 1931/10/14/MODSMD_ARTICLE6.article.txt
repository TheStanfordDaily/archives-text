# Abolition Of Lower Division Under Fire By Board Attorney
## Undergraduate Years Constitute Character-Building Process and Training in Leadership and Initiative, Says Presley 
### 
ABOLITION of the Lower Division was hit last night by George J. Pres
ley, former member of the Stanford Board of Trustees, present legal
counsel for the Board, and prominent attorney of San Francisco, in speak
ing before the Stanford Law Association in the Old Union last night.
"The first four years at Stanford constitute a great character-building
process and training in leadership and initiative," said Presley, "and if

ever there was a time when leaders
were needed, that time is now."
Presley, who is also secretary of
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce, pointed out that the histoi'y
of Stanford is steeped in self-sacri
fice and ideals, largely instituted by
the work of the late Chancellor
David Starr Jordan, "educator,
scholar, idealist, and humanist."
Trains Leaders
"I would hate to see men and
women turned away from Stanford,
one of the best training grounds for
future leadership and a place to ab
sorb the high ideals of the founders,
simply that Stanford may become
solely a graduate university."
While paying tribute to the gradu
ate schools of the University, espe
cially those of law, engineering,
medicine, and the sciences, Presley,
stated that "the last thing I want to
see happen at Stanford is the aboli
tion of the Lower Division."
Makeup of Lawyers
In addressing the law students,
Presley stressed the point that legal
knowledge was the most important
element to make up the successful
lawyer, other essential assets being
a magnetic personality, courage in
his convictions, willingness to as
sume responsibility, and reliability.
All these attributes, he said, were
more or less up to the individual,
supplemented by the guidance of
the law school faculty. The first
four years, however, he deemed to
be of the utmost value to students
in all and undergraduate
schools as well as the law depart
ment, if only to give them the op
portunity to completely absorb the
ideals and traditions started by the
founders and carried on by the pres
ent administration.
