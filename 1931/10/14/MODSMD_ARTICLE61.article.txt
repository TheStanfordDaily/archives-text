# PROFESSOR LUCK ORGANIZES REVIEW OF BIO-CHEMISTRY
## Contributions from Experts Throughout the World To Be Published 
### 
Professor ,J. Murray Luck of the
chemistry department has organ
ized a review of research in plant
and animai biochemistry which will
! have as contributors experts from
all over the world, he announced

In an interview Professor Luck
I said that the review will be pub
lished annually by the Stanford
I University Press and will consist of
