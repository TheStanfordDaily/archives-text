# LIVING GROUPS WILL HAVE NEW PICTURES FOR 1932 YEAR BOOK
## 
### 
Because of the dissatisfaction ex
pressed in recent â€¢ years over the
cuts of the houses in the Living
Group Section, the Quad has made
a special arrangement to have new
photographs taken for this year's
Annual, Tom Aitken, editor of the
1932 year book, said yesterday.
The cuts now in use have served
for more than eight years, accord
ing to Aitken, and many of them are
ncrt only out of date, but also are
in poor condition because of
scratches on the surfaces and ragged
edges.
This innovation of new house pic
tures will entail added engraving
expenses as well as photography, to
the extent of six dollars, stated the
'32 editor, and it will be left up to
the individual organization to de
cide whether it wants the Quad to
go ahead with the work.
