# Freshmen And Sophs Set For Mud Throwing
## Brown Announces Rules As Classes Organize 
### 
With both sides in readiness to
start hostilities promptly at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon on the Grays'
field, all advance reports point to a
keenly contested mud fight with the
outcome fairly uncertain. Bob
Brown, president of the A.S.S.U.,
has announced that the choice of
pits will be made but a few minutes
before the frosh and sophs go into
action.
An important rule tending to
eliminate contestants gradually from
the scene of the battle is that as
sooft as a man has been tossed into
one of the fifteen feet square pits
he will be automatically disqualified
from further action and will not be
allowed to participate in throwing
other opponents in the mud.
Late last evening President Hin
ton Howe of the sophomores an
nounced that both the hall and the
row men wei'e turning out in full
force for the fracas and that '34 ex
pects to have at least as large an
aggregation, if not larger, than the
frosh will put on the field. He also
stated that thorough organization
would mark the efforts of his class.
Captains Nate Nesser, Ralph Sta
ver, and Dave Cook of the frosh
have shown great activity in the
yearling camp, but will issue no
statement until after the event.
Because of objections filed by the
Board of Athletic Control, no grease
will be used in the three-feet deep
pits because of the injurious effect
on the field. Spectators should be
on hand by 2:45 o'clock to witness
the preliminary preparations.
