# BISHOP HANNA TALKS BEFORE NEWMAN CLUB
## Responsibility Of College Men And Women To World Emphasized 
### 
The responsibility of university
men and women, in a moral, re
ligious, and personal sense, to hu
manity, their university, their
church, and themselves—this was
the theme of the Most Reverend
Edward J. Hanna, D.D., Archbishop
of San Francisco, who addressed the
Stanford Newman Club last night
at the Women's Clubhouse.
Acting President Robert E. Swain
spoke of the friendships foimed
during university years, declaring,
"These friendships are lasting tics—
they are founded not on one's rat
ting in Bradstreet's, but on his worth
as an individual."
Following Dr. Swain on the pro
gram were: the Rev. Father A. .1.
Carroll, pastor of St. Thomas Aqui
nas Catholic Church in Palo Alto;
the Rev. Father James Cronin, New
man Club chaplain; Professors Au
relio M. Espinosa and Kurt F. Rein
hardt; and John Redhead, Newman
Club president.
The affair was in the nature of a
reception both for the Archbishop
and for the new Catholic students
of the University. One of the largest
gatherings in the history of the club
was assembled last night, and a
number of Palo Alto residents at
tended as well.
