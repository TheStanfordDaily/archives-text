## Freshman Sponsors, Sport Captains As Judges 
### 
In a hasty last-minute change
late yesterday afternoon the scene

Grays' to the freshman field. Spec

the varsity tennis courts.
Starting promptly at 3 o'clock,
hostilities will cease at 3:30, at which
time the side having successfully
ducked the greater number of op

the winner.
A small area behind the pits will
be roped off in order that men
thrown into the holes may be
counted as they emerge. All con
testants are asked to rise imme
diately after being thrown in the
mud in order that the possibility of
inhaling too much water may be
avoided.
It was especially stressed by the
committee in charge that all par

ing—preferably a bathing suit or its
equivalent. Men who are thrown in
the pits are automatically ineligible
for further competition. No grease
will be permitted, either in the pits
or on the bodies of the participants.
According to Don Tatum and
Dave Packard the sophomore class
