# Professor Hulme Will Write Dr. Jordan Story
## 
### 
A former editor of the Stanford
j Quad will again take up his pen to
\ write for the University yearbook.
Professor Edward Maslin Hulme,
history lecturer to generations of
j Stanford students since he closed
the last chapter of his own Quad
in 18%, will edit a special section
in the 1932 Quad entitled "The Story
j of David Starr Jordan," said Editor
I Tom Aitken yesterday.
Although he has not yet mapped
j out his article, Professor Hulme
plans to relate the early days of the
University and to picture Dr. Jor
dan moving about among the stu
| dents. Personal anecdotes of the late
chancellor will color the story.
"The life of Dr. Jordan may be
found in several biographies as well
j as his autobiography," said Profes-
I sor Hulme yesterday. "Hence u

I chronicle of his life would be mere I
! repetition. It is the human side of I
| him, how he lived among the stu- Â»
! dents in the first day of the Uni- !
1 vcrsity, the commanding figure of J
I the informal life and the guiding ;
I spirit of the administration that I
' would prefer to portray."
Hulme relates an incident of Dr.
j Jordan's first*days at Cornell when
he lived in a small cottage in the
rear of the homo of President An
drew D. White. "Dr. Jordan, major- j
ing in biology, called the small house |
'Struggle - for - Existence,' which i
later was shortened to plain 'Strug'." I
| In addition to being the editor of
j the 1806 Quad, Professor Hulme was j
| the editor of the J896-97 Sequoia, j
i a weekly literary magazine, having :
I such men as Bristow Adams, Will
i and Wallace Irwin, and Dane Cool- j
| idge as contributors.
