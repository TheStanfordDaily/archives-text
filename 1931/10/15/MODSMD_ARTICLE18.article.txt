# Dr. Swain Declines To Support Young's Charity Game Plan
## Post-Season Grid Games Thought To Be Big Benefit In Filling Coffers For Country's Jobless; Emergency Call Issued Colleges 
### 
THE autumn quarter linal exams, starting December 15, and the possible
interference which post-season football might cause the annual East-
West game, were the reasons given by Dr. Robert E. Swain, acting presi
dent of Stanford University, for his rejection of the Owen I). Young plan
for charity football games. According to Dr. Swain, "Stanford's last
scheduled game of the season comes on November 28 with Dartmouth, and
final examinations begin December 15. To schedule another post-season
game would work a serious hardship on the players. Furthermore, any
arrangement for Stanford to play another game during the holiday season

'would mean a serious interference
with the East-West charity game in
San Francisco. This region could
hardly support two such games."
Colleges Looked "to
Owen D. Young, chairman of
President Hoover's committee on
mobilization of relief resources, an
pealed to the colleges and schools
throughout the country today to
play at least one game for the job
less. According to Associated Press
dispatches, most of the universities
of this district are expected to par
ticipate in the charity plan.
Young stressed that the adminis
trative officers, the senior class in
each institution organize the stu
dents for attendance at the games
and give the widest possible pub
licity to it as a contribution of the
students to unemployment relief
funds.
Principle Expounded
"I realize fully the principle that
school and college football games
should not be used to raise money
for charity, and I recognize as
strongly the exception which should
be made to the principle to meet
a national emergency on the Presi
dent's call," he said.
"This is about the only kind of
thing which the students of our
-schools and colleges can do to aid
in the work which so many thou
sands of our citizens are volunteer
ing to undertake. It is an excellent
thing for the students to recognize
the emergency and to have a part,
with the rest of us, in meeting it.
The precedent of responding to the
President's call in a national emer
gency is a good one, and ordinary
rules should give way in the face
of it."
Response of America
, In concluding, he stated that he
had "no doubt of the hearty re
sponse of the young men and women
of America, and I thank them in
advance for their co-operation."
The latest press dispatch tonight
stated that another Army-Navy
post-season football game would be
one of the enterprises rallying to
the support of Young's plan.
