# LEAGUE TO INVITE US
## 
### 
GENEVA, Switzerland, Oct. 14 (/P)
—The League of Nations Council,
operating from the hotel sitting
room of Aristide Briand. decided
today to invite the United States to
participate in its attempts to bring
about a peaceful settlement in the
Sino-Japanese controversy in Man
churia.
Japan's representative objected to
the plan of asking American help
and the council agreed to await an
official statement from the Tokyo
government in the hope that this
opposition would be withdrawn.
Invitation Delayed
The formal invitation to the
American Government to send a
representative to sit at the council
table was, therefore, withheld to
night pending authoritative word
from Japan, whose troops now oc
cupy strategic points in Manchuria.
While official information was
lacking, it was understood from ex
cellent sources that Prentiss B. Gil
bert, United States Consul General
at Geneva, had been authorized on
receipt of the council's unanimous
invitation to take his place at the
league's executive table in a con
sultative capacity.
May Defy Japan
There was much anxious specula
tion concerning the probable con
tent of the Tokyo reply but the
opinion prevailed in league circles
that the council was competent and
ready to invite the United States
even over Japanese opposition.
It was universally desired, how
ever, that the invitation be unani
mously and cordially supported and
there was the added matter of
America's reported determination
not to accept unless all members ol
the council concurred.
