# PUSS DEFENSE DRILL IS GIVEN FOOTBALL MEN
## O.S.C. Points For Game In Revengeful Mood For Past Losses BEAVERS HAVE WEIGHT Indian Starting Line-up Not Yet Settled

Concentrating mainly on a bril
liant aerial attack and an impreg
nable pass defense, Pop Warner sent
his charges through another still
practice grind yesterday in prepara
tion for Saturday's scrap with Paul
Schissler's battling Beavers. There
i was no scrimmaging at all, the en
lire afternoon being devoted to the
perfection of a backficld defense
l against the highly touted Oregon
State air attack.
Hi 1 lan, Moffatt, Caddel, and Allen
spent a strenuous three quarters of
an hour breaking up a concentrated
passing attack which featured Orc
j gon plays executed by the rest of
' the backs and ends. The first-string
I back field found it plenty tough to
; break up the air raid that was being
1 perpetrated upon them, and it, was
j quite evident that the Big Red Ma
-1 chine will have to play heads-up
football to prevent a catastrophe
such as U.S.C. experienced in the
St. Mary's struggle.

In the meantime Warner is plan
i ning a few air stunts that should
leave the Oregon Staters a trifle
dizzy. Obviously, there is no sense
in trying to hammer a 200-pound
line, such as the Beavers will pre
sent, and expect to get results. Con
sequently, it is fairly reasonable to
! expect that Warner will use just
I enough line plays to draw the
Beaver defense in, and then open
up with his flashy assortment of
laterals, which should prove too de
ceptive arid fast for the heavy Ore-
I gon State eleven.
The Northerners will present a
fairly fast team despite its weight,
and a backfield composed largely
i of veterans; hence a fairly strenuous
afternoon looms for the Indian
squad. Schissler is concentrating on
this fracas, having come down to
see the Minnesota game himself last
week. Last year his squad held the
Redskins to a 13-7 score, which
I shows that Schissler can come
awiully close when he tries.

No changes have been announced
in the line-up; in fact no line-up
has been announced, and even when
j it is, the chances are pretty good
that some changes will be made by
I the time the game starts. Warner h
; fairly consistent in keeping his
I plans to himself, and the psycho
logical effect on the players is usu
, ally very good as a result. By this
time the Stanford coach has a pretty

i of how he intends to use them.

will not leave too much of a hole,

merous. George Grey was out on
the field trying some place kick;,

The Northerners will present a
fairly fast team despite its weight,
and a backfield composed largely
i of veterans; hence a fairly strenuous
afternoon looms for the Indian
squad. Schissler is concentrating on
this fracas, having come down to
see the Minnesota game himself last
week. Last year his squad held the
Redskins to a 13-7 score, which
I shows that Schissler can come
awiully close when he tries.
Neill, Grey Indisposed
No changes have been announced
in the line-up; in fact no line-up
has been announced, and even when
j it is, the chances are pretty good
that some changes will be made by
I the time the game starts. Warner h
; fairly consistent in keeping his
I plans to himself, and the psycho
logical effect on the players is usu
, ally very good as a result. By this
time the Stanford coach has a pretty
| accurate conception of the ability
| '>f his men, and it is just a question
i of how he intends to use them.

'of poison oak which appears bad

will not leave too much of a hole,

merous. George Grey was out on
the field trying some place kick;,

not expected back in the line-up
until nexi Monday.
Concentrating mainly on a bril
liant aerial attack and an impreg
nable pass defense, Pop Warner sent
his charges through another still
practice grind yesterday in prepara
tion for Saturday's scrap with Paul
Schissler's battling Beavers. There
i was no scrimmaging at all, the en
lire afternoon being devoted to the
perfection of a backficld defense
l against the highly touted Oregon
State air attack.
Hi 1 lan, Moffatt, Caddel, and Allen
spent a strenuous three quarters of
an hour breaking up a concentrated
passing attack which featured Orc
j gon plays executed by the rest of
' the backs and ends. The first-string
I back field found it plenty tough to
; break up the air raid that was being
1 perpetrated upon them, and it, was
j quite evident that the Big Red Ma
-1 chine will have to play heads-up
football to prevent a catastrophe
such as U.S.C. experienced in the
St. Mary's struggle.

In the meantime Warner is plan
i ning a few air stunts that should
leave the Oregon Staters a trifle
dizzy. Obviously, there is no sense
in trying to hammer a 200-pound
line, such as the Beavers will pre
sent, and expect to get results. Con
sequently, it is fairly reasonable to
! expect that Warner will use just
I enough line plays to draw the
Beaver defense in, and then open
up with his flashy assortment of
