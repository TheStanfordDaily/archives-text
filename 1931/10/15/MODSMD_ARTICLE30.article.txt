# FIGHT LIKE GENTLEMEN
## 
### 
Bv a voir of 1 lie freshman and sophomore classes llu*
mud light lias lieen reinstated, displacing the tie-up. To
day it is the duty of these classes to prove that this change
\v;is no mistake and this they can do by following the rules
of sportsmanship in their inlerclass battle on the drays'
Held this afternoon.
There were many objections to the mud light as it was
formerly singed. Men emerged naked from the holes, filled
not only with mud but with oil, garbage, and other refuse
as well. Many students were injure*! on the rocky bed of
Lagunita or bruised by roughhouse tactics.
lu the light as it will be staged tomorrow many of these
objections have been removed. The captains will toss a
coin for pits just before the fray to eliminate the possi
bility of the holes being filled with, refuse. The lurf of the
practice Jicid wlil prevent injuries that might be received
were the light held on the lake bottom.
With the above difficulties removed, all that remains
is for the combatants to conduct themselves like sports
men and gentlemen and the mud fight will become a fix
ture in campus life, to remain until some class, selfishly
disregarding the rules of conduct, again forces its aboli
tion.
Abide by the rules, if you are thrown in the pit don't
re-enter the light; don't use grease; don't try to strip your
opponent of clothes; don't slug or be unnecessarily rough;
and, above all, light like Stanford gentlemen.
