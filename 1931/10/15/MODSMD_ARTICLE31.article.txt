# STANFORD MUST REFUSE
## 
### 
Because Slanford docs not end her football season until
November 2K, only two weeks before the start of final
examinations, Acting-President Robert E. Swain yesterday
regretfully announced that the Indians could not engage in
a post-season game for charity.
Owen 1). Young, chairman of President Hoover's relief
crew, had appealed to all the colleges in the nation to turn
over the proceeds of at least one game to the unemployed.
The Big Pen has already sanctioned the charity games,
plans are under way for a renewal of the Army-Navy con
test for that purpose, and all of the Pacific Coast major
institutions have taken the plan under advisement.
Paradoxically enough, the President's own university
cannot fall in line, but the refusal was absolutely unavoid
able. The Board of Athletic Control, with its tremendous
building plan of the past few years to pay for, cannot
afford to turn over the receipts of any of its regularly
scheduled games without actually pinching the t'niversity.
Circumstances forbid tTie scheduling of another game. So
Slanford must stand regretfully by, anxious, unable to lift
a linger in (his splendid cause.
