# A 						FAMILY QUARREL

### 
In an adjoining column, tlie Bull-Sessioncr, Abe Mel
linkoff, turns the tire of his facile pen on the proposed plan
tor intercollegiate athletic competition for women. Mellin
kotf, who is a free-lance writer in every sense of the word,
can express in the Bull Session whatever opinion he
chooses, regardless of the Daily's own stand on the same
question. Today he has elected to flay a movement sup
ported yesterday in the Daily's editorial column.
Mellinkoff has painted a dreary picture of the future
lliat lies ahead of the development of women's athletics.
It will lead, he claims, to "the feverish training and hectic
planning that reacts so severely against men's sports . . . .
to special diets, long practices, women yell-leaders and
other things .... subversive to the demure, the petite and
the feminine in modern womanhood."
The Daily hopes that this year's plan does eventually
lead to varsity competition for women, despite Mellinkoff's
prediction. What the Bull-Sessioner has completely over
looked is the fact that the deadly parallel he foresees is, in
men's athletics, the product of highly developed commer
cialism. If the public was not paying great sums of money
to see the athletes in action, then there would be no money
to spend on special diets and feverish training. It is a far
< rv to the day when K(),(M)() or even SO spectators jam the
stadium to see California and Stanford women clash in a
hockey contest. I ntil that day, Mellinkoff's fears can be
dismissed as groundless.
"Which is more annoying, students coming into class
one to ten minutes late, or professors who keep their
classes one to live minutes after the bell has rung? Orr
