# BULL SESSION
## THE 						BIG pink machine 
### 
It was the big game—the classic
of the century—the annual hockey
clash between Stanford and Mills.
The crowds sat nervous and tense
in the packed stands—and a:s the
Big Pink Machine lightly tripped
out on the field, the band struck uj)
"Boble Forever" while the student
body with forced but no less heroic
gallantry, came in on the chorus:
"Will You Leave the Screen Open
Tonight?"
Man's slave and chattel for j
years and even centuries, woman
kind has ever forced its way over
barriers and through obstacles to
the golden ideal of liberty. The last '
link in the chains that bound them
to their horrible existence was
broken recently when it was finally
decided that intercollegiate athletics
for the Stanford "500" would be
initiated.
The men have interschool compe
tition; and what is fair for one sex,
is fair for the other. Is not this
nation founded on the principles of
equality for all and special privilege
for none? Doesn't the Declaration
of Independence say life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness? And
why shouldn't the Stanford women
have liberty to pursue their hap
piness? Furthermore, what is life
without intercollegiate athletics?
If it were a question of no exer
cise, the '*600'' would be perfectly
justified. But no one is denying
their right to take physical recrea
tion; the B.A.C. has given them a
gym adequate for their purposes.
Here they may sport and play to
their heart's content. It is not any
feeling of superiority or masculine
egotism, that prompts this writer's

' views. Rather it is because there
j are certain positive results that will
| follow in the wake of this new sys
! tem which are not to the best in-
I terests of anybody.
First of all, it will increase the
j stress now laid on woman athletics,
i It probably will lead to that feverish
\ training and hectic planning that
| reacts so severely against men's
j t ports. We have already been con
j ditioned to all the ballyhoo of men's
I athletics; but to transplant all this
i stuff to the "500'' as well is useless
; duplication.
Then also, while moderate par
' ticipation in sports may aid to
heighten feminine charm, there is
no doubt that special diets, long
practices, perhaps women yell
leaders, and all the other things that
accrue to intercollegiate competition
—are positively subversive to the
demure, the petite, and the feminine
in modern womanhood.
But, perhaps, the Bull Session is
old-fashioned. Perhaps those men
that don't give up seats in street
| cars, or take of! hats in elevators
are right. Perhaps those men that
treat the women as equals—which
means bringing them down to our
1 level—are in step with the times,
i The women think that something is
| being held out on them every time
I they are refused something on the
grounds of their being women.
Strike up the band; let the music
ring out! Herald women's inter-
I collegiate athletics! And after they
form their serpentina for the Mills;
triumph, perhaps they'll wonder if
it paid to sacrifice pure sport on the
j altar of greater competition,

The men have interschool compe

why shouldn't the Stanford women
have liberty to pursue their hap
