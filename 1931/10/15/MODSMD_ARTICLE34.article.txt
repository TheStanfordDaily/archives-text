PRECEDENT—At (he Curran Thea- |
tre. San Francisco.
I. J. Golden, apparently motivated
by a profound conviction of the in
nocence of Tom Mooney and a no
less profound disgust with the mass
of legal injustice which lay behind !
his incarceration, has turned from i
the practice of law to the practice
of drama with surprising results.
For a first play, "Precedent" shows i
dramatic ability. Although the first i
two acts are very little more than J
a survey of the well-known facts of I
the Preparedness Day bomb affair, j
with a few conjectures as to its
background, the manner of their j
presentation is such that they lose !
nothing by their repetition of known
incidents. The author has used short j
bits from the trial and only the
characters relevant to each incident !
are visible. This gives a short but 1
intensely dramatic impression of the j
trial which an elaborate court scene 1
would merely have been boring. !
Much credit is due the stage man - I
ager for the simplicity and excel- ,
lence of the arrangement of these j
scenes, although it is difficult to sen j
why he should have used a Stanford 1
pennant as the most prominent
decoration of the prostitute's room
in the first act.
The impression that this is mere- '
ly a subtle publicity scheme for the
release of Tom Mooney which the
first two acts give is entirely lost
in the final act which is really stu- j
pendous. It absorbs all your inter
est, makes you feel the vita) thing j
which the author is trying to put i
over—not a solution, but a stinging !
condemnation of the fact that laws j
have taken the place of justice in |
our courts.
Rober Warwick as Riley, the Dis- ;
trict Attorney, is excellent, and John ,
Ince as Fremont, apparently a trib- I
ute to a certain San Francisco edi- j
tor, portrays the character with ■i i
tremendous amount of feeling. Edna j
Bennet warbles through the difficult ;
part of the street-walker with per- j
feet stage presence. Even the minor j
characters with the ease and polish ,
of principals make a perfectly har- j
monious whole.
Such an excellent play is rare in !
San Francisco and deserves better |
attendance and a longer run.

THE SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK j
—At the Varsity
If you haven't seen many come- i
dies in your life, this Buster KeatonJ
attempt at humor may amuse you.
But if you're used to Charlie Chap- j

Min or the Marx Bros, this will ap
| peal only in the same way that the
Rover Boys books appeal to an Eng
i lish major—as an interesting ex
i ample of what one used to be
I amused by.
Every old wheeze known to the
Keystone films of the beginning of
the century has been employed to
| make into comedy what is funda
i mentally a serious story about
: gangsters, children being led into a
[ sinful life, and honesty being the
| best policy.
The few good new laugh ideas,
and the few old ones that are resur
rected with success, are enough to
make a presentable one-reel filler.
The rest consists of some unfunny
: funniness and a lot about a weeping
sister trying to keep her young
! brother on the straight and narrow
' path. —E.M.
EAST OF BORNEO—At the New
Stanford.
I A thoroughly interesting and ex-
I citing picture made from the same
j old '"white woman amid natives in
j a deserted part of the jungle'' plot
J that has been hackneyed until even
that word fails to lit. Scenes of wild
: animals are abundant; realistic,
1 (hough, and, strangely enough, you
I will fall for them, sit tight, and
I wish that some of the animals were
j not quite so close, even on the
i screen.

Rose Hobart has a lovely voice,
and uses it to its best advantage.
Other than that, she wears theatri
i cal evening clothes which sweep the
: floors of an Oriental monstrosity in
the form of a castle-dungeon, and
is undoubtedly the love interest.
1 Charles Bickford is strong enough
I to assure you of his ability to save
i anyone from the crocodiles—dhd
save them he does. But he's satis
fying, and mercifully not too senti
mental. That would have been the
last straw.
The volcano scenes are well done;
• the downpour of lava and the flash -
I ing of the crater are splendid. Su
| perimposition though it is, it's
| strictly unbelievable. And there is
a remarkable snake which beats
1 everything for real, earthly terror—-
1 go see it yourself! —V.B.T.
