i MOTHER GOOSE UP-TO-DATE
I Sing a song of twenty grand
Profits made from beer
Tour and twenty truck drivers
Driving out good cheer.
When the kegs were opened
The beer began to pop
| Now wasn't that a darn cheap dish
| With which to bribe a cop?

Modern Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet
Eating her snail for the day;
Along came a spider,
Sat down beside her,
And ended his life that way.
"Old woman, old woman, shall we
go a'shcaring?"
!"Jus( a little louder, sir, I'm very
thick o'hearing."
! "Old woman, old woman, shall !
kiss you dearly?"
' "Thank you. kind sir, breach-of
promise grounds most clearly."
[ If all the world were apple pie
! And all the sea red ink
j And all the trees were bread and
cheese
I There'd be a depression, I think
| Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
Stole a pig and away he run;
! The pig was caught, the police ap
prised.
And Tom was psychoanalyzed.

There was an old lady who lived in
a shoe
Who had so many chlidren she
didn't know what to do.
She whipped them and she scolded
them and she opened up her
jaws
| And yelled at them most loudly,
"What mean these Comstock
Laws?"
! Ilark, hark, the tabloids bark
The brokers are going to jail,
Some in rags and some in tags,
But none with any bail.
j Prosper Erity sat on a wall,
Prosper Erity had a great fall;
j All of Horb's speeches and all of
Herb's men
! Couldn't put Prosper Erity to
gether again.
, See-saw, here's Margery Daw.
And Johnny shall have a new
master;
He shall have but a six months' trial
Which is as long as a hubby can
last her.
