# FIRE CHIEF DUGAN RECOVERING FROM LATEST OPERATION
## 
### 
Fire Chief Ft. E. Dugan was able
to walk a little with the help of a
cane Tuesday. This is the first time
that he has been up since Septem
ber 27 when he underwent a four- '
teenth operation on his leg.
The operation was performed by 1
Dr. L. Roscoe Chandler at the Stan
ford Hospital in San Francisco. |
Trouble with his leg was due to the
recurrence of an injury sustained
by Dugan in San Francisco in 1910.
He was hurt in a collision with a
fire truck while riding on a street
car. About to step off the car Dugan
stopped a second to allow a woman '
to pass. Due to this hesitation his |
leg was caught between the street
car and the truck.
Dugan came to Stanford as chief
of the fire station in 1923.
