# Eastman Surprises Templeton By Winning At 100 Yds.
## "IRON MAN" WINS IN FIRST PRACTICE MEET OF SEASON In Past Meets Proved To Be Good In Distances; Now In Sprints 
### Dick Rodda 
Ts Bon Eastman, a sprinter, quar
ter-miler, or half-miler?
In the Big Meet and the 1.C.4-A.
meet last spring, "Blazing' Ben
proved that he was one of the na
tion's best in either the 440 or 830,
but last night in the first practice
track meet of the lull season Dink
Templeton's "iron man" demon
strated effectively that he was also
a sprinter by walking away from
Ralph Giberson in the 100 in the
last early season time of 10.2.
"Whether Ben. will be used in the
sprints next year is still undecided,"
said Dink. "But at any rate he will
confine his training to the sprints
during the fall."
Few Good Records
Except for Eastman's race in the
100-yard dash, a fairly good toss
of 176 feet 3 inches by A1 Ray in j
the javelin, and a tie between Johns i
and Wheeler at 12 feet in the pole j
vault, very poor times and distances j
were chalked up in the initial prac
tice affair.
Al Blackman won the 220-yard
dash with practically no effort.
Blackman is a freshman and shows
excellent promise.
Claims Record
In the hurdles Templeton may be
able to depend upon Stallings to
come through when the time comes.
Stallings took the high hurdles with
case. His time, 10.2, was slow, but j
he claims a record of 15.1 at Utah, j
from which university he trans- ;
ferred this year.
