# FLEET NEGRO HALFBACK LEADS ATTACK ON POWERFUL TROJAN MACHINE
## 
### 

Conference championship aspirations of Oregon or Southern California will be given added impetus after one of them wins the important
north south football game in Los Angeles. The hopeful Beavers will have as their chief threat Lillard, fleet negro halfback, and Gee, another
half. Captain Schulz will be at guard and Bowerman will probably see service at end. Shaver, Mohler and Musick will help do the ball car
rying for Troy while Captain Williamson will snap the pigskin from center.
