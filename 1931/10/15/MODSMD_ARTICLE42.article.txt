## GET THAT BEAGLE IN. BRICK! 
### 
Well, fellows, it's open season on
j good ol' Brick Morse again. The
j perennial California drooler has
jopened his cavernous trap once
I again and emitted just one more
j bunch of guff. It's all to the effect
j that California's victory over the
| Olympic Club means Stanford is in
for a licking on November 21.
The Daily remarked, some two
weeks ago, that Coach Bill Ingram
did not ease his own path by prom
ising great things for California
football this year. That statement
! still stands, and the Daily stands
1 with it.
Comes the aged Morse with the
' startling disclosure that the Daily's
editorial should now be interpreted
as Stanford's fear of California, and
that the O.C. triumph last Saturday
makes the Big Game all Blue and
I Gold.

Ingram is to be complimented for
the advancement he has made with
the Bears. Stanford fears California
as Stagg fear£ Purdue—eternally.
But this writer still believes that
California is in for three lickings
this season, and that good ol' Brick

j will live to see one of them on
i November 21.
■£><$> .
Football, baseball, track—vou'd
| think Morse would learn. But the
• same colossal tripe emanates from
j his typewriter year after year, no
matter what manner of twisting the
I Golden Bear receipts for. What'll
| you bet this year, Brick?
