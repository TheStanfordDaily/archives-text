# CALIFORNIA BEAR MASCOT TRAINING FOR BIG GAME DAY
## 
### 
While football fans are doping out \
tlif 1 coming season, "Lodi," black j
bear cub and "Cal's" mascot for the â– 
team, quietly passes the time caged j
up at a veterinarian's.
Lodi was caught and presented to :
the California football coach, Wil- j
liam "Navy Bill" Ingram, by alumni j
during the summer.
After two days his presence on the |
campus became a burden. It was !
difficult to know what to do with a |
four-months-old bear cub that ate
everything from candy bars of |
passersby to wooden benches.
The cub has been taught to walk |
with dignity on a leash in prepara- j
tion to walking into the stadium

! ahead of the team. Last year's mas
: cot bit one of his worshippers dur
ing the Stanford-Cal game.
After the games are over, Lodi,
whose hour of fame will have
| passed, will be placed in a zoo, since
j he is growing at the rate of nine
pounds a month.
