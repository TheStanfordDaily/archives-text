# Purple Favored To Beat U. C. L. A. At Chicago
## 
### 
While the Stanford varsity is at
tempting to stop the determined
thrusts of a heavy Oregon State
eleven Satui'day, the youngest mem
ber of the Pacific Coast Conference,
the University of California at Los
Angeles, will face one of the most
powerful teams in the country when
it tangles with Northwestern in an
intersections! contest in Chicago. As
might be expected, the Purple ij
favored; however, the outcome of
the game should be of no little in
terest to the Stanford campus.
The reasons for such interest are
twofold. The first being the fact
that a western team and a member
of the P.C.C. is matching strength
with a powerful squad from the
middlewest, the outcome reflecting
upon football as it is played on the
Pacific Coast. The other cause for
turning more than a passing glance
to this grid clash is the fact that we
must face the same U.C.L.A. eleven
on October 31, one week before the
S.C. game; plus fact No. 2 that we
face this same Northwestern crew
in a home-and-home affair in 1932-
33. Thus, the seemingly unimportant
â–  game takes on a new significance
: for the Farm.
Incidentally, if anyone figures that
j the Bruins are the greatest set-up
| yet devised by man, they are due

| for a big let-down. The Westwood
j eleven is coming up fast, and. wili
| give Pop Warner's proteges a stren-
I uous workout before accepting de
t feat. Warner will undoubtedly use
j the second team against the Bruins,
I saving the regulars for the Trojan
; tilt; however, don't fall out of your
seat if Pop finds it necessary to trot
out Hillman, Moffatt, and the rest
of the boys in order to squelch the
Westwood eleven.
