# DEBATE MANAGER PLANS SCHEDULE IN FORENSIC TILTS
## St. Ignatius And College Of Pacific Arguments For November 
### 
Preliminary arrangements with
St. Ignatius and the College of the
Pacific for debates on their plat
forms have been made by Debate
Manager John Gange. These argu
ments will take place late in No
vember or early in December.
Negotiations arc also under way
for similar meetings with St. Mary's,
Fresno State, and a number of near
by junior colleges. The question for
debate in all these contests will be
the same as that to be used in the
California debate on November 16:
"Resolved, That the present world
economic crisis constitutes a major
indictment of the capitalistic sys
tem."
Arrangements are being made by
Wardell Duggan, assistant manager,
for a debate squad dinner in the

formal affair for the men's squad
only.
Contrary to all announcements,
the meeting of freshman men in
terested in debating will not be this
week, but will take place Monday
evening at 7:30 o'clock in Room 201.
At that time they will meet Profes
sor Emerson, head debating coach,
Leland Chapin, assistant coach, and
John Gange, debating manager.
Arrangements for forming a squad
will be made as well as announce
ments concerning freshman debat
ing activties for the year.
