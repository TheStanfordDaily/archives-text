Brief as a jolly-up, versatile as »
the day's news, foody like an aca- !
demic sandwich—these are the |
Tuesday Evening Lectures, sched- j
uled throughout the year for Stan- j
ford students.
Topics of past seasons range from !
Bunyan to Benjamin Franklin, from I
Manchuria to Mexico, from Astron- !
omy to English Women, and to lend I
still further variety, are added pro- J
grams from the Ito Dancers to a
reading of Journey's End.
Popular readings of recent quar- i
ters have been Mr. Moneypenny, '
John Brown's Body, and Green '
Pastures-. The Committee on Public j
Exercises secures the speakers, j
many from the campus intelligentsia, j
and many imports; so far it has
marked up a long list of successes i
among the lectures.
Though generally given within the i

f friendly limits of the Little Theatre,
the Tuesday lecture is sometimes
| moved—as on the memorable night
when to a packed Assembly Hall,
i Ronald B. McMillan furnished the
! dialogue to his own moving picture
| of the North Pole expedition. Ham
! lin Garland brought another such
I turn-out with his personal remini
' seences of authors he has known—
| Barry, Conrad, Kipling, Shaw,
i The Tuesday evenings for the rest
t of this quarter make an interesting
! menu—"Sidelights on the Farm
i Board," by Davis of the Food Re
search Institute; "Fundamental
' Problem of Ethics," by Schlick of
| Vienna; Perry Dilley's puppets in
i "The Emperor's New Clothes," and
Mrs. Guy Farrington reading "The
Barretts of Wimpole Street," cur
rent New York play in which
i Katharine Cornell is playing the
i lead.
