"THE BEST FOOD IN TOWN"
♦
LUNCHEON
Our chef is now offering some mighty
fine choices on the luncheon menu.
For 45c you are able to get a full meal,
hot, tasty, and fresh. You have your
choice of meats, with soup, drink,
salad, and a desert.
DINNER
After we are through lunch the chef
starts preparing dinner and starts it
cooking around 4:00 o'clock. Nothing
is the same on the dinner menu as on
the lunch menu. Everything for this
meal is freshly cooked and you again
have a superb meal for 65c.
FOUNTAIN SERVICE
If you are too late for lunch or dinner
you can obtain a nice meal at the foun
tain. These meals are served up there
after the coffee shop has closed.
