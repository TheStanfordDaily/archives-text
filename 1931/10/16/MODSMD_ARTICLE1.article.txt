# FROSH BOW TO SOPHOMORES IN MOO SCRAMBLE
## Class Of '34 Breaks Three Year Jinx In Revival Of Annual Clash TATUM LEAVES BATTLE Brown States 100 First Year Men Dipped 
### 
Breaking the so-called "three
year jinx," the Class of '.'l4 adminis
tered a decisive trouncing to their
freshman opponents before a huge
crowd of mud-fight fans on the
frosh practice field yesterday after
noon. The decision was announced
by Sloan McCormick, head of the
committee in charge of ihe event.
Although McCormick announced
the result as being very close, in the
opinion of the majority of the spon
sors and sport captains, who acted
as judges, the second-year men
showed greater power in defeating
the yearlings. The time of action
was unexpectedly shortened to
twenty minutes from the announced
period of half an hour.
'34 Loses Leader
During the first charges of the
contestants Don Tatum, soph cap
tain, had his wind knocked out and
waii taken into the gym, where he
recovered. Other casualties were
slight.
The frosh marched onto the field
promptly at 3 o'clock in column
formation, shouting "To hell with
'."34!" This chant was not abandoned
until the battle was well under way.
Although few sophs were on time,
when the gun started the fray at
3:05, the opposing sides were pretty
evenly matched, the second-year
men having a larger turnout than'
in any previous year. Both sides
were lined up on opposite side lines
of the field and rushed pell-mell at
each other as hostilities commenced.
Count Estimated
Men stationed at the pits to count
the number doused in the slippery
mud were not able to do so, but
an unofficial statement of Bob
Brown held that 100 frosh were
tossed into their pit. In the closing
minutes of the affair the majority
of the participants, on both sides,
were in several and varying stages
of undress.
