Ramponi, Biancone, and Ward, ail versatile Oregon State triple threat men, share the quarterback post
on the Beaver varsity. Coach Schissler has not indicated who will start against the Cardinals tomorrow, but
at present the veteran Ramponi has the edge on the job. Ward was an understudy on the varsity last year,
while Biancone was a freshman star.
