# CONFERENCE MEETING DISCUSSES WOMEN'S CAMPUS REGULATIONS
## 
### 
At the conference meeting held
last night at the home of Dean
Mary Yost, several questions re
garding the women's regulations on
the campus were discussed.
The lockout regulations were read
by Barbara Beach Thompson and
were followed by the new decision
that houses should automatically be
open for a half hour after dances.
This means that no one will have
to sign out if she returns to the
house before the half hour is over,
1:30 after a 1 o'clock dance, and
12:30 after a 12 o'clock dance.
The question of smoking in the
rooting section at football games
was also brought up, resulting in
the ruling that Stanford women
shall not smoke at games.
Emphasis was laid upon the schol
arship regulation referring to the
granting of late leaves. By the rul
ing, late leaves will be granted on
the basis of the previous quarter's
record, so that if a woman has a
C average, or over, for the preced
ing quarter, she may have as many
late leaves as she wishes.
