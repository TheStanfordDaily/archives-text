## Japan Lone Voter Against League's Invitation 
### 
GENEVA, Oct. 15. (/Pi—Overrid
ing Japanese objections in a deter
mined effort to obtain full partici
pation of the United States in the
task of restoring peace in the Far
East, the council of the League of
Nations tonight voted to invite
Washington to place a representa
tive at its horseshoe table.
There was little doubt in the
minds of observers that Consul-
General Prentiss Gilbert will be in
structed by Washington to sit in
the council meetings on the Sino-
Japanese question, but some spec
ulation was rife as to whether
America would accept the invita
tion under conditions which plainly
stamp Japan's unwillingness to havt-
America represented.
Sole Objector
Nearly three hours of dramatic
secret debate behind closed doors—
with the American observer, Pren
tiss Gilbert, consul-general at
Geneva, kicking his heels in the
corridor outside along with a mill
ing, excited, and curious crowd—
preceded the decision, which was
taken by a vote of 13 to 1.
Clinging stubbornly to his story
that Japan is unable to ignore the
juridicial aspects of the proposed
invitation, Ambassador Kenkichi
Yoshisawa carried his opposition to
the ultimate climax. When Foreign
Minister Briand of France, presid
ing, put the motion for extending
unanimous or a majority council
invitation to Washington, Yoshisawa
alone voted:
"No!"
