THE TROJAN HORSE
In the days of long ago the mighty j
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme;
| But a simple wooden horse upset j
their mighty boast
And their glory became but a dream, j
Now the Trojans have a namesake i
down at Southern Cal
And they're boastful as boastful i
can be;
But they're goin' to meet their mas
ter, for the Cardinal
Will play horse with U.S.C.
lIAIL ALMA MAT Kit
Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater, Hail!
Stanford, Hail! Thy fame shall e'er
prevail.
j Thy sons thy glory shall acclaim
j And ever honor thy fair name

So, Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater,
Hail! I
A SON OF A GAMBOLIER
I
Oh, I wish I had an ocean of rum, I
of sugar a million pound.
The dear old Quad to mix it in. and
the chimney to stir it 'round.
I'd drink to the health of the Car
dinal, so glorious and so true
And I'd join the rollicking chorus,
to Hell with the Gold and Blue.
CHORUS:
I'm a son of a, son of a, son of a,
son of a, son of a gambolicr j
A son of a, son of a, son of a, son
of a, son of a gambolier
Like every honest fellow, I like my J
lager beer;
I'm u rambling rake of poverty, a j
son of a gambolicr. •

Oh, Here's to dear old Stanford,
where the color of life is red; '
l We'll rise and give the Varsity from '
our coffins when we're dead.
' And when we mount the golden •
stairs, we'll give St. Peter the
cue,
To join the rollicking chorus, To
Hell with the Gold and Blue.
CHORUS.
THE CHANT
Stanford Indian,
Scalp the Bear—
Scalp the Golden Bear.
Take the Axe
To his lair
Scalp the Bear,
Stanford Indian.

THE CARDINAL IS WAVING
I
The Cardinal is waving, over the
field,
Our men are fighting, with a spirit
that will not yield.
Rah. Rah, Rah.
I*arewcll, old Berkeley—we're after
you;
Once again, the Cardinal will WHIP '
the Gold and Blue.

When the ganfe is over and the foe
has fled
The Cardinal is triumphant, and the j
Oski Bear is dead.
Rah, Rah, Rah.
Farewell, old Berkeley—we're after
you;
Once again tho Cardinal has j
WHIPPED the Gold and Blue. I
