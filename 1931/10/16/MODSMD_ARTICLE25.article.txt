# Electric Clocks Better Stadium Timing Systems
## New Installation Shows Exact Time Of Play 
### 
Some of the more observant fans i
at last Saturday's Minnesota game |
probably noticed an improvement in !
the timekeeping system at the Sta
dium. Thanks to a new invention j
installed last summer in both the !
Stanford and California stadiums, ■
the ex?ct time of play remaining is j
correctly indicated to a close degree '
on the scoreboai'd in full view of
spectators.
This is accomplished by electric j
clocks on the sidelines and behind j
the scoreboard, which save the time- |
keepers a large amount of worry j
and arithmetic. The system operates
quite simply.
At the opening whistle, the time- |
keeper presses a button on a small '
control box and the playing time
is recorded on a dial. When "time |
out" is called, he presses another j
button and a second dial shows the j
exact length of the interruption. !
Meanwhile, the hand registering the
actual playing time stops until the I
timekeeper presses the first button l
again at the resumption of play. j
The scoreboard clocks are syn
chronized with the control box and, i
though they do not record the "time i
out," the hands stop the moment j
the game is interrupted and start
again the instant play is continued, j
Both the Stanford and California j
stadium systems were installed by ;
the F. A. Thomas Company, 47 Sec- j
ond street, San Francisco, at a cost |
of $1,000 each.
