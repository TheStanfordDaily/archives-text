# Allen Lost To Indians On Eve Of Beaver Tilt
## Warner Concentrates on Perfection of Aerial Play; Colvin and Moffatt Shine on Receiving End of Passes; Neill and Glover Out RINTALA TO START GAME AT FULLBACK POST Schissler Points for Cardinals with Big Advantage in Weight; O.S.C. Never Victorious 
### DICK RODDA 
ALLEN, upon whose passing ability Pop Warner had depended
to carry out a sensational aerial attack against the Oregon State
Beavers here Saturday, was called to Southern California yesterday when
it was learned that his mother is seriously ill.
Allen left last night for his home in Huntington l'ark and will not he
here for the opening conference game. In his place at fullback will be
Rudy Rintala, who spent most of last night's practice session throwing
the pigskin in aerial plays designed to penetrate the powerful Oregon
State defense. Outside of Rintala for Allen at fullback the Indian first-

lineup that will begin tomor
] row remains the same:
Left end—Colvin
j Left tackle—Hand
Left guard—Bigclow
Center—Milligan
Right guard—Corbus
Right tackle—Ehrhorn
Right end—Tod
| Quarterback —Hillman
I Left halfback—MofEatt
Right halfback—Caddel
F ullback—Rintala
Injuries Develop
The Cards will probably also bo
! without the services of Neill at end
j and Glover at half. Both are laid
j up with poison oak. And with Grey
I and Gribben, tackles, still nursing
| knee injuries, the squad has devel
| oped quite an injured list.
Despite the loss of Allen and the
! several men out from injuries Pop
! Warner's Big Red Machine is cx
( pected to function well enough to
| defeat the Beavers tomorrow.
Points for Cards
The battle will be a "tough one,"
however, as Paul Schissler, Beaver
| coach, is pointing particularly to
: ward this game, bringing with him
j one of the best outfits he has ever
i coachcd. The Beavers' chief advan
! tage over the Cards is that of
I weight. Stanford will be outweighed
; by 10 pounds to the man on the line
; and 5 pounds in the backfield.
Schissler, like Warner, is relying
i on a passing game as the principal
means of conquering the Indian
i tribe. It is therefore apparent that
; an exceptionally fast open game will
I be served Saturday's crowd.
Arc Always Threat
Schissler's teams have always
been a threat to the Cards even
jthough they have taken the short
end of the score ever since Stanford
■ and Oregon State first met in foot
ball, in 1919. But it will be remem
: bered that Oregon State has always
: scored against Stanford, and last
i ye:"- was the first team to cross its
| goal line. A victory by Oregon State
j tomorrow is not at all impossible.
MofTatt and Colvin will again be
lon the receiving end of most of
Stanford's passes. The pair have
been snagging forwards and laterals
I all week during practice. Whether
Hillman will do so much line plung
! ing as he did against Minnesota last
week and Santa Clara two weeks
• ago will depend upon whether or
■ not the beefy Oregon line is as
| strong as reports say it is.
