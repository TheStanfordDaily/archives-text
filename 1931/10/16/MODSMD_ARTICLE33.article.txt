# MORE ABOUT THE CO-OP

### 
In a recoilt editorial, The Daily pointed out the neces
sity for complete co-operation among till the members ot
the Students' Co-operative Purchasing Association in order
to secure lower prices on food commodities and give better
service to the members.
It is decidedly unfair for houses who belong to the
co-op to purchase articles outside of the organization and
profit by lower prices which have come about as a direct
result of the competition offered by the co-op. If volume
competition were removed, prices would begin to soar
again.
The question comes up: If the houses can buy more
cheaply outside, "why shouldn't they save money by do
ing so?
Here's the answer: Taking vegetables for example, the
purchasing power of the co-op can be effective only when
it comprises all the houses. The co-op can buy for less as
the volume increases, Ihi'is making a protit which will be
turned back to the houses in the form of dividends. If the
volume is cut 2.") per cent, there is 110 profit and the houses
which buy outside are cutting their owi? throats. In addi
tion to this, the dividends 011 100 per cent volume would
bring (he cost of vegetables to the same or a lower level
than is paid at the "wagon." This same argument holds
for other commodities as well.
Mouse managers, most of them new at the job at this
time of year, are prone to take as fact, without checking,
various rumors that are going around the campus. It is
a comparatively simple matter to verify or disprove such
rumors if the interested person will take the time to do it.
A lot of criticism and opposition to tiie co-op could be
eliminated, paving the way to better understanding and
better service.
