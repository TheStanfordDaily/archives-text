# THE 						MUD FIGHT IS HERE TO STAY
## 
### 
Yesterday's exhibition of "good, clean fun" brings back
memories of the days when tlie Sophomore - Freshman
clash was a battle of the giants.
Properly staged, the mud fight is a vast improvement
over the tameness of the tie-up that has prevailed for the
past four or five years. Having a clean field reduces to a
minimum the possibility of injury to the participants.
Hilt best of all, the absence of rough stuff' that was char
acteristic of both sides would, even if there were nothing
else, make this form of the fracas worth while.
