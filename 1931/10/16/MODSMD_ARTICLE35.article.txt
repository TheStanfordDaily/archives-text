# TEN CENTS A DANCE
## 
### 
Tonight tlie campus is being offered on a silver philter
I he opportunity for dancing, sociability and a general good
lime which straitened financial circumstances have with
held from many of the students this quarter.
For a microscopic fee (ten cents, to he exact) any stu
dent may dance for three hours. The Pi Beta Phi house, at
which Ibis informal affair will take place, deserves to he
congratulated for the initiative, enterprise, and resource
fulness which its members arc displaying. This house is
making the difficult first move. If they are successful, the
way is paved for other houses to follow.
There is no reason why this fiewcst pro-campus, pro
prosperity venture should fail, and its positive success
would add another laurel branch to our "Stanford for
Stanford people" wreath.
