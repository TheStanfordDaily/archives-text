# SILENCE, PLEASE
## 
### 
Students cautiously walk down the library aisles, tak
ing care not to make too much noise. Students lean across
the library tables to whisper about an assignment or to
make a date, trying not to disturb their neighbors. Silence
is essential to concentration and all try to be as quiet as
possible so that something may be accomplished before
the library closes.
Suddenly the huge room is filled with a clanking,
pounding and metallic rumbling. The din seems terrific,
in contrast with the stillness of a few seconds before. Dis
tracted, everyone looks up from his reading; some, dis
gusted, collect their books and walk out. Studying is im
possible and students stare helplessly around, hoping that
the racket will soon cease. The noise subsides only to start
up again at intervals. Finally one man leans toward his
neighbor and voices the thought dominant in the minds
of all.
"Say, why don't they fix these damned library radi
ators ?"
