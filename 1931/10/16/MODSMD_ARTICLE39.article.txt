## LEAGUE FAILS TO SCORE AS NIPPON'S SHOW STRENGTH 
### 
No one seems sure that a v/ar >s !
going on over there in Manchuria; '
we do know that airplanes, infantry, j
artillery, and warships have been
ordered to the area. We do know (
that cities have been bombarded,
that people have been killed, and
that China claims a state of war
exists. Suffice it to say, that there j
is some marked difference of opinion
being manifested between Japan and
China.
Further than that, China has
asked, implored, and threatened the
League of Nations to appoint a neu
tral commission to investigate the
trouble. Japan claims, however, thai
the matter can be settled between
the two disputing parties; and when
one considers Japan's military
strength and China's nineteenth
century army, one cannot help agree j
with Japan's claim. The Nipponese, !
it seems to this writer, are not liable
for world condemnation because -
they are only acting as every other
first-rate power would act.
When in Rome do as the Italians, ,
when in Chicago, duck, and when ,
in a world of force, use force. Had [
Nicaragua or Cuba appealed to the I
League and when the Marine Corps j
was "protecting American lives and i
property," making Smedley Butler j
famous, and creating material for I
McLaglen-Lowe films, it is extreme- i

'ly doubtful whether that august
I body would even have listened to
i the complainants. And if they had
risked an insult to the U.S.A. by
! lending an ear to those small na
tions, it is still more likely that the
League would have done nothing.
And if they tried giving advice to
Yankeedom, they would have heard
such a volume of abuse that tlu>
echoes of "Monroe Doctrine,"
"America First," and "The Stars and
Stripes Forever" would still be in
the air.
I It is not to the direct discredit of
the League of Nations that they
have been unable to act against a
i major power; it simply indicates in
a very clear fashion the state ol
world co-operation among the na
tions. It simply shows that world
peace talk about a brotherhood of
' nations and the outlawry of force
! is as yet a drama. In this particular
case, no general war is to be ex
j pected; and as soon as nationalistic
fueling quiets in both nations, the
I League will probably act. That the
i League will eventually attempt to
I do something is the opinion of ex-
I perts; but that it cannot act to ston
j a military crisis when a major na
; tion is involved is a sad but none
j the-less actual condition.
Of course, this does not mean that
! the League is wholly worthless. It
| was able to crush the nationalistic
aspirations of 16,000 Aaland Island
j ers; it operates an International
j Labor Office; and has moved to
l stop the White Slave trade. And
j lastly it serves as a body of intel
; lectual co-operation and world un-
I derstanding.
These things it does do; but those
! that claim that all the nations have
: joined in the League to bring about
world peace—which must necessi
tate national frustration at times—
I and that the United States is the
! one power standing on the outside
; preventing nations from deciding
disputes as individuals do—anyone
I holding this view is misinterpreting
; the facts as the present Sino-Japa
nese crisis indicates.
