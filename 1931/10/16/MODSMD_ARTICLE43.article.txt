Proving practically nothing ex
cept that mud is dirty, that all men
are essentially brutal, and that why
the devil should any sophomore
class think itself better than any
bunch of frosh anyhow, we had a
mud fight yesterday, and worked
off at lot of excess energy.

audience were duly impressed,
and nobody went completely
back to nature so we can still
cross fingers when we sing "The
Winds of Freedom Are Blow

Somebody just piped up with a

sort of expected the sophs to win,
but their class president's name is
Hinton Howe, you know. Our punster
says, "Hell—what good is Hinton
Howe Why doesn't he Tell-em
How?" And that is the end of our
fable.
