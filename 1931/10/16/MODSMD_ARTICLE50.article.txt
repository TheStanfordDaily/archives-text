"LOOK OUT!"
Let's forget this U.S.C. thing for
awhile and do a little worrying
about "Shifty Paul" Schissler and
his invading Oregon Staters.
"Pop" Warner was quite seri
ous the other day when he told
the writer he expected a tough
game Saturday. Ife didn't even
want to talk about the \Vashing
ton affair the following week.
And "Shifty Paul" was appar
ently just as serious when he
made his now famous remark to
the effect that he thought he
could "take" Pop this time.
Everyone who has seen the Ore
gon State team in action this year
says, "Look out!" Among these are
John Bunn of the local coachfng
staff, and "Bill'' Warner, Pop's
brother.
After the promising showing made
by the Indians against Minnesota
last Saturday, it is hard to take a
team seriously that has succumbed
regularly to Stanford for yeahs, and
yeahs, and years.
But remember that Schissler
has had two weeks in which to
point for a game which Stanford
must of necessity take in stride.
And remember, too, that Oregon
lias ALWAYS scored on Stan
ford. Even in when the
Red Steamroller crushed the
northern eleven under a total
of 40 points, the Staters scored
one touchdown.
Oregon State was the first team
to score on Stanford last year, and
it may be the first this season. The
Indians will again take an unblem
ished scoring record into the game.
Of course Stanford should win—
we all believe they will—but don't
be surprised if "Shifty Paul" gives
Pop a run for his money.
"Now what the heck kind of
play is THAT!" demanded
Schissler's second assistant scout
at the Minnesota game.
Don Colvin had just appeared
<iut of no place in particular to
grab Allen's pass away from two
Gophers for a gain of .'JO yards.
The truth of the matter was
that that pass was intended for
Moffatt, with Colvin acting as
a decoy, hut when the latter saw
Phil was covered, lie simply took
matters (and the hall) into his
own hands.

Open season on managers and
coaches is here. Fritz Crisler, Min
nesota coach, felt the ax when his
Gophers lost to Stanford. Donie
Bush, manager of the Chicago White
Sox, will be replaced by Lou Fon
seca, former San Francisco player.
But the biggest surprise of all is
the ousting of Nick Williams, who
has just piloted the San Francisco
Seals to a Coast League pennant.
The Seal management says Wil
liams resigned, but he declares in
no uncertain terms that he was
'Tired." —L.M.C.

it may be the first this season. The
Indians will again take an unblem
ished scoring record into the game.
Of course Stanford should win—
we all believe they will—but don't
be surprised if "Shifty Paul" gives
Pop a run for his money.
"Now what the heck kind of
play is THAT!" demanded
Schissler's second assistant scout
at the Minnesota game.
Don Colvin had just appeared
<iut of no place in particular to
grab Allen's pass away from two
Gophers for a gain of .'JO yards.
The truth of the matter was
that that pass was intended for
Moffatt, with Colvin acting as
a decoy, hut when the latter saw
Phil was covered, lie simply took
matters (and the hall) into his
own hands.

Open season on managers and
coaches is here. Fritz Crisler, Min
nesota coach, felt the ax when his
Gophers lost to Stanford. Donie
Bush, manager of the Chicago White
Sox, will be replaced by Lou Fon
seca, former San Francisco player.
But the biggest surprise of all is
the ousting of Nick Williams, who
has just piloted the San Francisco
Seals to a Coast League pennant.
The Seal management says Wil
liams resigned, but he declares in
no uncertain terms that he was
'Tired." —L.M.C.
"LOOK OUT!"
Let's forget this U.S.C. thing for
awhile and do a little worrying
about "Shifty Paul" Schissler and
his invading Oregon Staters.
"Pop" Warner was quite seri
ous the other day when he told
the writer he expected a tough
game Saturday. Ife didn't even
want to talk about the \Vashing
ton affair the following week.
And "Shifty Paul" was appar
ently just as serious when he
made his now famous remark to
the effect that he thought he
could "take" Pop this time.
Everyone who has seen the Ore
gon State team in action this year
says, "Look out!" Among these are
John Bunn of the local coachfng
staff, and "Bill'' Warner, Pop's
brother.
After the promising showing made
by the Indians against Minnesota
last Saturday, it is hard to take a
team seriously that has succumbed
regularly to Stanford for yeahs, and
yeahs, and years.
But remember that Schissler
has had two weeks in which to
point for a game which Stanford
must of necessity take in stride.
And remember, too, that Oregon
lias ALWAYS scored on Stan
ford. Even in when the
Red Steamroller crushed the
northern eleven under a total
of 40 points, the Staters scored
one touchdown.
Oregon State was the first team
to score on Stanford last year, and
it may be the first this season. The
Indians will again take an unblem
