# Little Hope For Frosh Win Over Bakersfield
## BRADSHAW PLANS TO START SECOND STRING MATERIAL Light, Inexperienced Team Must Hold Visitors To Reasonable Score 
### Spud Hamilton 
Averaging 160 pounds, a plucky
little Stanford freshman second
string grid team will take the field
tomorrow with the almost hopeless
task of halting the vicious attack
of an invading Bakersfield Junior
College outfit. »
On their shoulders rests the re
sponsibility of holding in cheek a
team that will be out to enhance
its record with a staggering victory
over a Cardinal yearling squad and
from Schween, 148-pouncl left end,
and Kelly, a 150-pound right half,
to the more normal football-sized
Cook, who will hold down a guard
position and who tips the scale at
200, they are going to fight like
demons.
Use No Regulars
Coach Bradshaw will use no first
string men at all unless his starting
team does the impossible and keeps
Bakersfield from scoring. In that
event Bradshaw might inject some
of his punch and speed into the
fray to try for a touchdown.
The starting ltne-up announced
yesterday includes Schween and
Mullen, ends; Steiner and Savage,
tackles; Cook and Loomis, guards;
and Pope at center.
Inexperienced Team
Strong starts at quarter; Flippen,
full; and Wyman and Kelly, halVos.
Few of these men, with tl»e excep
tion of Cook, have had much ex
perience. Pope played most of last
Saturday's contest, but Strong and
Wyman have been in the fray but
a few minutes this year. Flippen has
played but little, yet he is one of
the most capable defensive backs on
the squad despite his weight of only
155 pounds.
The injured quartet, consisting of
Van Kirk, Durkec, Bowles, and
Semmelroth, still remain out of the
i unning as fur as Saturday's game
is concerned, though Van Kirk is
the only man not in a suit.
