# THREE INTER-CONFERENCE TEAM GAMES ATTRACT FOOTBALL INTEREST SATURDAY
## 
### 
Pacific Coast football fans should
get quite a treat <his week-end with
a number of closely contested clash
es scheduled among conference
teams. Two of the Conference '"Big
Three," Stanford and California,
play their initial 1931 Conference
games, although both have already
engaged in a number of stiff pre
liminary contests.
Oregon State invades the hunting
grounds of the Redskin with a
heavy, fast aggregation that is ca
pable of causing plenty of trouble
for Pop Warner's cohorts. The
tricky Warner laterals and reverses
should prove a little too much for
the Beaver crew; no cinch though,
by a long way.
Navy Bill Ingram takes his sturdy
Golden Bears on their first road
trip this week-end to make their
Conference debut against Washing

j ton State, last year's titlists, at Port
j land. The Berkeley eleven is all
I pepped up from their unexpected
\ triumph over the strong Olympic
! Club team, and they will be mighty
I hard to upset in their present frame*
j of mind. Ingram is expecting rainy
weather and has been holding his
j practice sessions on a muddy field.
The Trojans are entertaining Doc
I Spears, Joe Lillard, and company
lat the Olympic Stadium and will
I undoubtedly give them a warm re
i ception. Although the Webfoots
| looked impressive in their win over
j Washington, they can not be con
j ceded an even chance with the S.C.
i eleven (neither was St. Mary's in-
I cidentally). Jones' reserves and
power plays have been working well
lately and should be good for a two
touchdown margin of victory.
Idaho and Washington tangle in a
relatively unimportant struggle at
Seattle with the home boys favored.
U.C.L.bravely faces the rugged
Purple squad from Northwestern in
j an intersectional clash at Chicago
■ which finds the mid-westerners
heavv favorites.
