# MADRID RIOTING FLARES AFTER VATICAN BREAK
## Papal Envoy Confers With New Spanish Leader, Bears No Enmity 
### 
MADRID, Oct. 15. (ff)—Religious
riots flared in Madrid and several
other cities today as reports per
sisted that relations between the
: republic and the Vatican have
reached the breaking point as a
i result of yesterday's anti-church
legislation by the cortes.
Mgr. Frederico Tedeschini, Papal
Nuncio, conferred with Manuel
i Anzana, who yesterday succeeded
Niceto Alcala Zamora to the jprovi
| sional presidency. Alcala Zamora
[ resigned rather than countenance
| the cortes' approval of article 24
I of the constitution which calls for
| the expulsion of the Jesuits, con
fiscation of their property and the
limitation of the activities of other
; religious orders.
Recall Reported
Mgr. Tedeschini talked with the
' new president as reports persisted
j that he already had beeen l-ecalled
1 to the Vatican and that diplomatic
relations between the republic and
| holy see had been severed. These
l reports the Monsignor emphatically
t denied.
Meanwhile it became increasingly
| evident that the new government's
I first problem will be to settle the
) vexing religious problem caused by
! the adoption of article 24. As the
l cabinet met in extraordinary session
!to discuss this, reports from the
I Basque and Navarre provinces
brought threats of revolt against
the central government.
In the capital police charged a
! mob of anti-clerical demonstrators
, who showered them with stones.
Sixteen were injured. Catholic stu
dents, protesting against the anti
■ religious measures, clashed with
I workmen on Barcelona's river front.
; At Granada strikers battled police.
Friendly Talk
Mgr. Tedeschini denied he met
President Azana for other than a
j friendly discussion. He said:
"My only remark to the president
I was that the church may be in
: jured, but she bears enmity toward
j no one. I wish the new govei'nment
j good luck and success."
