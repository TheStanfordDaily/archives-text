— Thomas A. Edison, who died '
peacefully before dawn today at the
hilltop estate where he labored to i
give light, work and recreation to
millions, did not wish to live, Dr. |

improbable.
His wife and six children, close in i
attendance during the last stages of !
the eleven weeks' sickness, had been j
told by Edison that his work was i
finished. He would rather leave the
world, he said, than burden them j
with the disabilities of age and ill- :
ness.
In the quiet of the early morning J
on the Llewellyn Park estate a for- \
mal notice of Edison's passing was
brought to newspaper men by Ar- ;
thur L. Walsh, vice-president of I
Thomas A. Edison Industries, Inc.
Pale and visibly shaken, Walsh |
walked down a tree-lined path from I
the home to press headquarters in j
the Edison garage to read the bul
letin:
"Thomas Alva Edison quietly
passed away at 24 minutes after 3
a.m., Oct. 18, 1931. (Signed) Dr. Hu
bert S. Howe."
Almost instantly the message
girdled the globe by telephone and
telegraph system which were a part
of the industries valued at $15,000,-
000,000 to which Edison contributed
major inventions.
