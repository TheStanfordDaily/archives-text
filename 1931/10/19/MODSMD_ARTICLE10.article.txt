# CAPONE VERDICT ROCKS GANGDOM
## Underworld Chief Facing Long Prison Term 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 18 (/P).â€”Al Ca
pone, who was found guilty of in
come tax evasion by a Federal Court
jury, may be sentenced next Tues
day morning. He faces a possible
maximum penalty of seventeen
years in prison and a fipe of $50,000.
The conviction of Capone was a
distinct shock to the underworld in
Chicago, where Capone, for years,
has been the dominating figure. In
every speakeasy and roadhouse in
the Chicago area today the topic of
the conversation was the blow dealt
Capone by the legal forces of the
United States government.
Capone, who had outlasted five
chiefs of police in Chicago and sur
vived numerous investigations and
reform crusades, finally has met his
Waterloo as a result of his first clash
with the Federal government. His
conviction was a stunning blow to
him, from which he has not yet re
covered.
