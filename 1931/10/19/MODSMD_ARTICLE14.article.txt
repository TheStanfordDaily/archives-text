# HOOVER OPENS AID DRIVE WITH FUNDS APPEAL
## Urges Americans To Adopt Charitable Policy Of Brother's Keeper 
### 
FORTRESS MONROE, Va., Oct. 18
(/P). â€” President Hoover asked the
nation tonight to contribute to local
funds for the jobless, urging that
i every American adopt a policy of'
| becoming his brother's keeper.
Landing here en route to York
town, he broadcast his doctrine of
j community rather than Federal aid
1 from the home of the commandant
j of this aged fortress. Thus the Pres
ident opened a national drive from
; October 19 to November 25, in which
his relief committee will aid the
I gathering of local funds.
' Stresses Obligations
"No governmental action, no eco
nomic doctrine, no economic plan
|or project," he said, "can replace
! that God-imposed responsibility of
I individual man and woman to their
i neighborhs."
"The possible misery of helpless
people," the President said, "gives
me more concern than any other
! trouble this depression has brought
i us. It is with these convictions in
I mind that I have the responsibility
j of opening this naiton-wide appeal
' to citizens of each community that
j they provide the funds with which,
| community by community, this task
shall be met."
i He appealed for such contribution
; to the drive ending November 25 as
i would make the next day, Thanks
giving, the "outstanding Thanksgiv
ing day in the history of the United
i States."
Recalls Early Victory
Further, he translated the York
town victory celebration he will at
tend tomorrow into terms of the
; country's present economic condi-
I tion.
"It recalls," he said, "the final vic
] tory of our people after years of
sacrifice and privation. This nation
passed through Valley Forge and
came to Yorktown.
"Part of our national suffering to
-1 day is from failure to observe . . .
primary yet inexorable laws of hu
man relationship. Modern society
cannot survive with the defense of
i Cain, 'am I my brother's keeper?' "
