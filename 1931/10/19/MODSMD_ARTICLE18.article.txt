## San Francisco Eleven Gives Gaels Big Scare 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 18 (/P).â€”
Only undefeated and untied major
eleven on the Pacific Coast, St.
Mary's Galloping Gaels kept a bril
liant record intact today with a 14
to 6 victory over a hard fighting
University of San Francisco team.
Forty thousand spectators turned
out to see the Gaels emerge on the
long end of the score after one of
the toughest struggles so far this
season. The San Francisco eleven
had been pointing for this game
since the season started, whereas St.
Mary's already had fought two ter
rific battles in conquering the big
Coast Conference teams, Southern
California and California, on succes
sive week-ends.
The San Francisco team scored
first, putting over a touchdown after
recovering the ball in midficld. Line
drives advanced the ball to the 22-
yard mark where Warford, quarter
back, broke loose to race over the
Gaels' goal line. It was the first time
San Francisco had scored any points
against St. Mary's in six years of
competition. The try for point failed.
