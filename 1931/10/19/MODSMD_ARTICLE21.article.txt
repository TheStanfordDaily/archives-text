# No Back-Seat Driver In 'Pop's' Big Red Machine
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
No back-seat coaching for Mrs. j
Glenn S. Warner —other than a sea
son ticket for the 50-yard line, she ,
takes no active part in football.
This is just right, according to
"Pop" Warner's opinion. "She never
tells me how to run the team," says
Pop, with pleasure. The Warner
home on Madrona street is a sale
retreat to which one of America's
ranking coaches can. flee when he
gets weary of talking shop. On the
contrary, when he wishes to mull
over tomorrow's plays at his own
hearthside, he can be sure of one
intelligent auditor, at least.
The popular pattern for a coach's
wife—and one not without living
example—points out a lady who ;
gnashes her teeth at the games, I
feverishly attends every practice,
makes charts of every play, is well ;

acquainted with all her "boys," and (
spends long hours at home in ,
wheedling the coach into giving Joe j
Zilch his big chance in the back- j
field, or into starting "Tuffy" Glutz :
at end.
Not so Mrs. Warner. Although she
never misses a game, the bulbs in
her garden get more personal super
vision than the rarest gridsmen on j
her husband's squad. Her home and |
flowers take up Mrs. Warner's time,
and her leisure she devotes to read- j
ing.
Women's varsities come in for a j
word of approval from Mrs. Warner, •
backed up also by the booming sup- j
port of Pop. A Mills-Stanford tennis f
match would find both Pop and Mrs. '
Warner in the gallery.
