# JAPAN BRANDS LEAGUE ACTION; ASKS U. S. AID
## Resources Marshalled In Drive To Oust League As Arbitrator 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18. (/P) —
; The United States tonight was
! ready to help direct the full force
|of the Kellogg-Briand anti-war pact
against the threatened outbreak in
the Orient.
Secretary Stinison, however, will
! withhold a formal American note to
Japan and China calling their at
tention to obligations under the
treaty until formally notified of the
invocation of the pact by the League
of Nations Council.
GENEVA, Oct. 18. (/P)— Frankly
dissatisfied with the manner in
which the League of Nations is
t handling the controversy, Japan to
day marshalled all her resources in
a determined effort to transfer from
i Geneva to Washington the negoiia
| tions for settlement of the Chino
' Japanese Manchurian dispute.
Two outstanding moves by Tokio
1 featured the opening of this drive:
1. The publication with dramatic
i suddenness of a Tokio note to
I French Foreign Minister Briand,
| president of the Emergency League
| Council session, publicly challeng
ing the League's authority to pro
! ceed in considering the Manchurian
! problem with the United States at
I the council table.
Better Qualified
. p.. An authoritative declaration by
; Japan that she considers President
; Hoover and U.S. Under-Secretary
iof State Castle, with their back
! ground of study and experience in
| the Far East, far better qualified
! than Briand, British Foreign Secre
j tary Lord Reading, and Italian For
! eign Minister Grandi to work ef
i fcctively for a solution of the diffi
, culty.
i Japan made it significantly plain
that Tokio is relying on Washington
! rather than the dragging inter
i changes at Geneva, to find the ulti
: mate way out of the controversy.
Ultimatum Given
By this unexpected change of
1 front Japan achieves a double pur
pose. She emphasizes that her op
: position to the United States' par
i ticipation in the League Council
sessions is not directed against
! Washington's direct participation in
j efforts to solve the problem, and si
| multaneously takes a vigorous slap
I at the League for the Council's ac
tion in so unceremoniously over
| stepping Tokio's juriuicial objections
! to the invitation extended the United
States.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 18. (/P) —
; The United States tonight was
! ready to help direct the full force
|of the Kellogg-Briand anti-war pact
against the threatened outbreak in
the Orient.
Secretary Stinison, however, will
! withhold a formal American note to
Japan and China calling their at
tention to obligations under the
treaty until formally notified of the
invocation of the pact by the League
of Nations Council.
GENEVA, Oct. 18. (/P)— Frankly
dissatisfied with the manner in
which the League of Nations is
t handling the controversy, Japan to
day marshalled all her resources in
a determined effort to transfer from
i Geneva to Washington the negoiia
| tions for settlement of the Chino
' Japanese Manchurian dispute.
Two outstanding moves by Tokio
1 featured the opening of this drive:
1. The publication with dramatic
i suddenness of a Tokio note to
I French Foreign Minister Briand,
| president of the Emergency League
| Council session, publicly challeng
ing the League's authority to pro
! ceed in considering the Manchurian
! problem with the United States at
I the council table.
Better Qualified
. p.. An authoritative declaration by
; Japan that she considers President
; Hoover and U.S. Under-Secretary
iof State Castle, with their back
! ground of study and experience in
| the Far East, far better qualified
! than Briand, British Foreign Secre
j tary Lord Reading, and Italian For
! eign Minister Grandi to work ef
i fcctively for a solution of the diffi
, culty.
i Japan made it significantly plain
that Tokio is relying on Washington
! rather than the dragging inter
i changes at Geneva, to find the ulti
: mate way out of the controversy.
Ultimatum Given
By this unexpected change of
1 front Japan achieves a double pur
pose. She emphasizes that her op
: position to the United States' par
i ticipation in the League Council
sessions is not directed against
! Washington's direct participation in
j efforts to solve the problem, and si
| multaneously takes a vigorous slap
I at the League for the Council's ac
tion in so unceremoniously over
| stepping Tokio's juriuicial objections
! to the invitation extended the United
States.
