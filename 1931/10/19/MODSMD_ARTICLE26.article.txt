# Indians Erratic In 25-7 Triumph Over Orangemen
## Cardinal Second-Stringers Hold Oregon State to 7-7 Tie In First Half; Beavers' Vaunted Passing Attack Gives Them Lone Score AFFLERBAUGH MAKES BRILLIANT 81-YARD RUN Regulars Take Field in Second Halt to Score Three Touchdowns Against Tuckered O.S.C. Men 
### 
TWO lightning-like thrusts for touchdowns, a 50-yard machine-like ad
vance. and a ten-yard parade through a tired bunch of Beavers—that
was Stanford's 25 to 7 win over Oregon State last Saturday. Not nearly
so decisive as the score would indicate. The score, for instance, does not
reveal that, six minutes before the closing gun, the black-jerseyed visitors
were driving like mad for the Indian goal, a bare 19 yards from the touch •
down that would have tied the score. Stanford held and Stanford scored
twice after that. As a ball game, it was very interesting. I'op Warner
crossed up the experts and started a makeshift array of second-stringers

Beavers 7-7 through the half.
Oregon State started fast. A half
pint quarterback named Tommy
Ward galloped 26 yards into Stan
ford territory early in the opening
quarter, and the Indian irregulars
didn't halt the advance until Joslin
i came up a bare yard from the goal
! line on fourth down. Kenny Affler
j bough kicked out and Oregon State
S came right back to the 19-yard line
j before being halted.
Spectacular Run
Whereupon Afflerbaugh swung
j around from his right half post 011
; a single reverse, came to the line
j of scrimmage to find an enormous
| hole, and the Beaver secondary
I moving to its own right, pivoted
I sharply to leave them flatfooted and
j outran safety man Ward for 81 yards
i and a touchdown. Spud Hardy
| place-kicked the extra point and
j the irregulars were through for the
i day, offensively speaking.
| Coach Paul Schissler of the
| Northerners yanked Ward after that
I and put in another pint-sized quar
j terback named Johnny Biancone,
| who will do as a ball-carrier until
| a real one comes along. After Keith
I Davis had intercepted a lateral in
! tended for Hardy in the second
1 period, Biancone went off left tackle
j for 13 yards and a first down on
! Stanford's 35-yard line. Until that
' moment, not one pass had been
thrown by either team. So Biancone
I threw one to Moe for nine yards,
| one to Little for 12 more, added a
I crack or two at the line and came
! up with the first down four yards
; from the last white stripe. Rust
| circled left end for the score, and
j K. Davis tied it up with a place
| kick.

I After one embryo drive had been

i sideline from midfield to Ihe Beaver
35 with Davis' punt. Allen hit for 14
on a spinner, Hillman split the mid
dle of the line for six on a delayed
buck, and Caddel sprinted over
right tackle for 15 and the touch
down. Shortly afterward Moffat t
receipted for a kick in the back on
a punt return and had to be carried
from the field. Both teams fiddled
around thereafter without doing
much until Frenchy Lacombe's punt
went over Biancone's head and waf>
grounded on the visitors' 26. With
eight minutes to play, the game
! looked safe enough.
Whereupon Oregon State com
pleted four passes in seven plays,
Biancone doing the throwing, Moe
and Rust the receiving. Nineteen
yards from the goal line the drive
fell fiat, but might not have had not
Hermann dropped another Biancone
pass with a first down in his lap.
Stanford partisans sighed relievedly,
i then shouted with joy as Colvin,

cone, gathered in Allen's 45-yard
toss and romped 20 more to the
\ touchdown.

Oregon State received the kickolT

on his own 45 and whirled to the
Beaver 20 before a black jersey

Baker hit for a first down on the
10, but two plays more yielded only
! three yards, and Norgard failed to
hold Rintala's pass on the goal line.
Rudy faded again, ran to the left
looking for a receiver, but found

j named Hammer and a guard named

the defense, and Biancone headed a
list of backs who would look good
anywhere. For Stanford, Red Hand

greatest advantage, Colvin playing

TWO lightning-like thrusts for touchdowns, a 50-yard machine-like ad
vance. and a ten-yard parade through a tired bunch of Beavers—that
was Stanford's 25 to 7 win over Oregon State last Saturday. Not nearly
so decisive as the score would indicate. The score, for instance, does not
reveal that, six minutes before the closing gun, the black-jerseyed visitors
were driving like mad for the Indian goal, a bare 19 yards from the touch •
down that would have tied the score. Stanford held and Stanford scored
twice after that. As a ball game, it was very interesting. I'op Warner

Beavers 7-7 through the half.
Oregon State started fast. A half
pint quarterback named Tommy
Ward galloped 26 yards into Stan
ford territory early in the opening
quarter, and the Indian irregulars
didn't halt the advance until Joslin
i came up a bare yard from the goal
! line on fourth down. Kenny Affler
j bough kicked out and Oregon State
S came right back to the 19-yard line
j before being halted.
Spectacular Run

; a single reverse, came to the line
j of scrimmage to find an enormous

I moving to its own right, pivoted
I sharply to leave them flatfooted and
j outran safety man Ward for 81 yards
i and a touchdown. Spud Hardy

I and put in another pint-sized quar

I Davis had intercepted a lateral in

1 period, Biancone went off left tackle
j for 13 yards and a first down on
! Stanford's 35-yard line. Until that

thrown by either team. So Biancone
I threw one to Moe for nine yards,
| one to Little for 12 more, added a

on a spinner, Hillman split the mid
dle of the line for six on a delayed
buck, and Caddel sprinted over
right tackle for 15 and the touch
down. Shortly afterward Moffat t
receipted for a kick in the back on
a punt return and had to be carried
from the field. Both teams fiddled
around thereafter without doing
much until Frenchy Lacombe's punt
went over Biancone's head and waf>
grounded on the visitors' 26. With
eight minutes to play, the game
! looked safe enough.
Whereupon Oregon State com
pleted four passes in seven plays,
Biancone doing the throwing, Moe

yards from the goal line the drive
fell fiat, but might not have had not
Hermann dropped another Biancone
pass with a first down in his lap.

I After one embryo drive had been

i sideline from midfield to Ihe Beaver
35 with Davis' punt. Allen hit for 14
on a spinner, Hillman split the mid
dle of the line for six on a delayed
buck, and Caddel sprinted over
right tackle for 15 and the touch
down. Shortly afterward Moffat t
receipted for a kick in the back on
a punt return and had to be carried
from the field. Both teams fiddled
around thereafter without doing
much until Frenchy Lacombe's punt
went over Biancone's head and waf>
grounded on the visitors' 26. With
eight minutes to play, the game
! looked safe enough.
Whereupon Oregon State com
pleted four passes in seven plays,
Biancone doing the throwing, Moe
and Rust the receiving. Nineteen
yards from the goal line the drive
fell fiat, but might not have had not
Hermann dropped another Biancone
pass with a first down in his lap.
Stanford partisans sighed relievedly,
i then shouted with joy as Colvin,
1 racing into the clear behind Bian
cone, gathered in Allen's 45-yard
toss and romped 20 more to the
\ touchdown.
Kintaia Scores
Oregon State received the kickolT
! and passed once. Lacombe caught
on his own 45 and whirled to the
Beaver 20 before a black jersey
spilled him. Lambert, Rintala, and
Baker hit for a first down on the
10, but two plays more yielded only
! three yards, and Norgard failed to
hold Rintala's pass on the goal line.
Rudy faded again, ran to the left
looking for a receiver, but found

| ten yards through the tuckered
j Beavers for the final score.

i dian reverses. A chunky center
j named Hammer and a guard named

the defense, and Biancone headed a
list of backs who would look good
anywhere. For Stanford, Red Hand
and Don Colvin showed to the
greatest advantage, Colvin playing
; a whale of a defensive game for a
change. The middle of the line,

TWO lightning-like thrusts for touchdowns, a 50-yard machine-like ad
vance. and a ten-yard parade through a tired bunch of Beavers—that
was Stanford's 25 to 7 win over Oregon State last Saturday. Not nearly
so decisive as the score would indicate. The score, for instance, does not
reveal that, six minutes before the closing gun, the black-jerseyed visitors
were driving like mad for the Indian goal, a bare 19 yards from the touch •
down that would have tied the score. Stanford held and Stanford scored
twice after that. As a ball game, it was very interesting. I'op Warner
crossed up the experts and started a makeshift array of second-stringers

?> \vho did right well to battle tlio
Beavers 7-7 through the half.
Oregon State started fast. A half
pint quarterback named Tommy
Ward galloped 26 yards into Stan
ford territory early in the opening
quarter, and the Indian irregulars
didn't halt the advance until Joslin
i came up a bare yard from the goal
! line on fourth down. Kenny Affler
j bough kicked out and Oregon State
S came right back to the 19-yard line
j before being halted.
Spectacular Run
Whereupon Afflerbaugh swung
j around from his right half post 011
; a single reverse, came to the line
j of scrimmage to find an enormous
| hole, and the Beaver secondary
I moving to its own right, pivoted
I sharply to leave them flatfooted and
j outran safety man Ward for 81 yards
i and a touchdown. Spud Hardy
| place-kicked the extra point and
j the irregulars were through for the
i day, offensively speaking.
