# THE 						INFERNAL FEMININE
## 
### 
Al A.W.S. conference last Thursday night the women,
upon unanimous consent of all the house presidents,
passed a recommendation forbidding women to smoke in
the rooting section during football games.
t'.S.C. passed a similar resolution against women smok
ing in the rooting section and the inference was that Stan
ford women should follow the same ruling at the l .5.(1.-
Stanford game. For the Stanford women to observe the
procedure followed by the southern institution would be
commendable, but to pass a blanket restriction covering all
the football games is going too far.
As long as the women have placed this restriction upon
themselves, this regulation of conduct must he the proper
and correct move to make. Hut when the women have
waged, and still are carrying on, such a long, uphill fight
for freedom, a backward step like this voluntary restric
tion of their smoking privileges is only giving up con
quered ground that must be regained before their war
against sex discrimination can be won.
By passing this ruling against smoking in the rooting
section the women have admitted that they cannot be al
lowed the same freedom permitted men and that women
ijs individuals cannot judge for themselves as to what
proper conduct is, but must be restrained by rules and
regulations instructing them how to act in a ladylike
manner.
The fact that women's smoking is countenanced else
where on the campus is proof that their smoking in the
rooting section would not bring down upon the Stanford
women the unfavorable criticism that they think it would.
Smoking is a matter for each individual to decide for her
self and no attempt at mass regulation should be made
against the practice.
Stanford has been noted for the freedom allowed its
women. Their two-thirty lock-out privilege was a deserved
though hard-won victory which seemed to establish the
principle that college women need not be guarded, chaper
oned and watched over nuns in a convent, that they
have the brains and ability to take care of themselves.
Hut this backsliding step of restricting smoking, which
is in itself incidental, shows that the women's loud squawk
for freedom, equality and absence of mid-Victorian regu
lations is at its best only a timid suggestion.
