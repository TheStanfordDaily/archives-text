# SAUCE FOR THE GANDER

### 
Lillard is out!
So ran Ihc word on Thursday night as the Pacific ('.oast
(lonference met in Portland and decided that Oregon Uni
versity's negro grid star was ineligible for competition he
cause he had played semi-professional baseball. Jonathan
A. Butler, new conference commissioner, dug up the dirt
on Smoky Joe, and also laid the foundation for more lire
works. It seems that the Pacific Northwest colleges have
had what they call a "gentleman's agreement" concerning
athletes who played semi-pro hall. That agreement must
go by the hoards now, Oregon having been stung 011 it.
Oregon's attitude is easily understandable. It must seem
unfair to them that the first official act of the new com
missioner (Oregon was not too strong for the idea, any
way) must result in the barring of their best gridman. The
votes of confidence that were scattered back and forth at
the meeting mean little.
What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and
Oregon will be on deck to see that the gander likes it when
it is somebody else's turn. House-cleaning time looms on
the horizon.
Lillard is out!
