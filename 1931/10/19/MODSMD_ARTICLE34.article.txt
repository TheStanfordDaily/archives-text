# INTERNATIONALISM FORWARD
## 
### 
For a year, Stanford students have hern supporting a
good idea. II is an idea with no organization, no set mem
bership, nothing but its value to keep it going. Men and
women students of all nationalities eome to the I'liion for
lunch, sit next to a different person every week, informally
introduee themselves, and form what is known as the In
ternational Table.
Members of all the clubs interested in internationalism
support it, the A.S.S.t'. International Committee started it,
and students who have no time for a regular organization
but who are interested in meeting and knowing foreign
students attend. Stanford lias no International House, such
as the one at l .C,., and the need for one is evidenced bv the
interest shown in the International Table.
