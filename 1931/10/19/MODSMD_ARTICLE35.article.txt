# BULL SESSION
## MRS. MOODY PROVES TWO THINGS OF IMPORTANCE 
### 
Some time ago Mrs. Moody, nee
Helen Wills, created quite a stir by
the presentation of a "thing" ihat
was supposed to be her impression
of a symphony or an opera or some
musical composition. Those of you
who failed to see this graphic repre
sentation missed something; and this
writer, who did see it, probably
missed everything. The "thing" is
indescribable.
It closely resembles the passionate
efforts of two very young, feverish
children armed with a pencil in each
hand—furiously at work on the
same piece of paper. Although art
was always a struggle for me in
grammar school, it is without the
slightest sense or braggadocio, that
1 feel that I could "create" things
akin to the Wills masterpiece with
my right hand behind me and my
eyes blindfolded. And it is without
any feeling of campus loyalty that
it is stated that any person at Stan
ford could do the same.
The aggravating part of the whole
procedure is that the "thing" ap
peared on the program of the San
Francisco Opera Association—San
Francisco representing itself as the
city of culture, and the Opera As
sociation supposedly manifesting
that culture. While the world is still
liberal enough not to have taken
legal steps had Jane Doe or Jose
phine Doakes perpetrated this, our
earth is not kind enough not to
have laughed outright at the desire
of any unknown to print such stuff.
We in America—robbed of royalty
upon whom to heap undeserved
adulation —create our own heroes

1 from among our successful citizens.
! And we go further. If an individual
is successful in one field, the people
1 assume that individual to be an ex
! pert in all lines of endeavor. An in
j dustrial vizard like Henry Ford
j immediately becomes an authoiity
jon all subjects; the intricacies of
j education, religion, politics, and
morals are soon subjugated by his
j master intellect—in the public mind
!at least. Albert Einstein is quoted
as an authority on many fields un
related to relativity. We find Gene
I Tunney handing down opinions on
i Shakespeare. And now we find
! Helen W ills attempting some type
of written figuration.
While it is not maintained that a
j person prominent in one field may
I not be learned in several, it some
times appears humorous and yet sad
! to see our citizenry expect and in
i their own minds attribute all-around
excellence a priori to any individual
| that succeeds in one activity.
The other condition that Mrs.
i Moody has so clearly illustrated is
i the excessively jaded outlook that
I hangs like a wet rag over so many
people today. Only in such a society
would this Wills stuff be tolerated.
It is this society—seeking something
NEW above everything else—that
j has accepted such things as the
i "Moody Masterpiece," Eugenie hats,
I cubist "art" (so-called), and par
| lorized Freudian psychology.
Mrs. Helen Wills Moody is a mas
i ter on the courts; may the future
i find her keeping all her curves and
j slashes in that field.

grammar school, it is without the
slightest sense or braggadocio, that
1 feel that I could "create" things
akin to the Wills masterpiece with
my right hand behind me and my
eyes blindfolded. And it is without
any feeling of campus loyalty that
it is stated that any person at Stan
ford could do the same.
The aggravating part of the whole
procedure is that the "thing" ap
peared on the program of the San
Francisco Opera Association—San
Francisco representing itself as the
city of culture, and the Opera As
sociation supposedly manifesting
that culture. While the world is still
liberal enough not to have taken
legal steps had Jane Doe or Jose
phine Doakes perpetrated this, our
earth is not kind enough not to
have laughed outright at the desire
of any unknown to print such stuff.
We in America—robbed of royalty
upon whom to heap undeserved
adulation —create our own heroes

1 from among our successful citizens.

is successful in one field, the people

j dustrial vizard like Henry Ford
j immediately becomes an authoiity
jon all subjects; the intricacies of
j education, religion, politics, and
morals are soon subjugated by his
j master intellect—in the public mind
!at least. Albert Einstein is quoted
as an authority on many fields un
related to relativity. We find Gene

of written figuration.
While it is not maintained that a

excellence a priori to any individual

The other condition that Mrs.
i Moody has so clearly illustrated is
i the excessively jaded outlook that
I hangs like a wet rag over so many
people today. Only in such a society
would this Wills stuff be tolerated.
It is this society—seeking something
NEW above everything else—that
j has accepted such things as the
i "Moody Masterpiece," Eugenie hats,
I cubist "art" (so-called), and par

Mrs. Helen Wills Moody is a mas
i ter on the courts; may the future
i find her keeping all her curves and

Some time ago Mrs. Moody, nee
Helen Wills, created quite a stir by
the presentation of a "thing" ihat
was supposed to be her impression
of a symphony or an opera or some
musical composition. Those of you
who failed to see this graphic repre
sentation missed something; and this
writer, who did see it, probably
missed everything. The "thing" is
indescribable.
It closely resembles the passionate
efforts of two very young, feverish
children armed with a pencil in each
hand—furiously at work on the
same piece of paper. Although art
was always a struggle for me in
grammar school, it is without the
slightest sense or braggadocio, that
1 feel that I could "create" things
akin to the Wills masterpiece with
my right hand behind me and my
