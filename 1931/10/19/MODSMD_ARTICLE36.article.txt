SUSAN LENNOX—At (he Stanford
Theatre.
Here is good old blood-and-thun
d e r , never-darken-my-doorwav
again mellerdrammer, dressed up in ;
the modern trappings of super- ;
excellent photography. And if you
don't believe it is a blessed relief
from the usual run of tripe exuding
from Hollywood, go and see it.
The great Garbo is pleasantly sub- ;
duecl in the time-honored role of i
Susan and shows a great improve- |
ment on the slinking style of her j
other pictures. She is supported by 1
a crew of excellently cast minor
characters who all do justice to their i
parts. Clark Gable does a good iob
as the hero, even if his bull-headed
obstinacy is rather hard to believe.
The acting of his pet police dog put I
him slightly in the shade.
The potography was the best we
have seen yet, with subtlety of 1

lighting effects more reminiscent of
German films than Hollywood.
Perhaps we have wasted enough
paper beefing righteously about rot
ten comedies, but who knows, per
sistence is supposed to gain its due
rewards. But it begins to look as
though they might be deferred un
til the next world. —S.C.A.
CAUGHT—At the Varsity Theatre.
If all the land were paper and all
the sea were ink, we suppose Para
mount would still give us Wild West
thrillers.
Of all the overdrawn, mother
loving, cattle-stealing pictures,
"Caught" is without exception the
most overdrawn, etc. Everyone is
very, very black or very, very white
or very ridiculous like Calamity
Jane. We admit, however, that
Louise Dresser, as Calamity, did
what she was intended to do with

: ihe part. She did it with strength,
J you may be sure. Calamity Jane is
1 the hard-boiled saloon-keeper who
; can out-drink and out-shoot all the
; men around and who goes all
i "wunky" just in time to make the
1 talkie "a drama of sacrifice."
—E.T.P.
