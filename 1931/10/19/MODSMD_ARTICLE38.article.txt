L'AMOUR EST MORTE
The memory of love, they say, dies
late
And so I know that I shall not
forget
When we two lovers met at your j
low gate
To whisper words that ever
sounded new.
And when *we walked beneath a
rising moon
To talk and kiss and find delight
In every simple sound of nights in
June
0
We never thought that love like !
ours woidd end.
Yet still I cherish memories: your
arms
That glinted in the moonlight:
nose and ehin

That seemed a Grecian gift to make
your charms
Akin to those which launched a
thousand ships.
And these dead memories I'll hold
through life—
I'm sure of this—As long as you're
my wife.
The man who writes the sports
column here hopes the women can
have varsity intercollegiate competi
tion in athletics, while the column
ist amidships fears it will har-rahize
feminine muscular activity. Person
ally, we think it would mean a new
Revolution. Why, the very fact that
all our icemen in summer would
become women has social eonse

; quences galore, to say nothing of
robbing the comic magazines of the
i mother-in-law's only staple rival.
1 And think of women in some schools
winding the clocks and sweeping
oft the sidewalk.
Or imagine the restrictions on sc

( both in training. Eventually the con
dition would lead to an influx of
i women bond salesmen, ahd then

work? And can't you see Ma Mor

feminine muscular activity. Person

Revolution. Why, the very fact that
all our icemen in summer would

as she anxiously orders triple-threat
Mamie into the fray? And the little

_ i the varsity!" Our sympathies, col
