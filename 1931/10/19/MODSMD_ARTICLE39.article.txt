Whether Navy Bill Ingram's Cali
fornia Bears really have anything
in the way of a running attack and
a stone wall defense remains to be
seen. If not, the remains will be seen
after they conclude a little argument
with Howard Jones, Mohler, Musick,
Shaver and Co. in the Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley next Saturday
afternoon.
Truly the Bears did show a
winning light against the Wash
ington State Cougars last Sat
urday and against the Olympic
Club a week ago. But the Tro
jans are taking such teams as
Washington State, Oregon, and
the like almost as setups, using
third- and fourth-string men in
order to keep the scores down.
The Cougars were trounced 38 to
6 by U.S.C. and Oregon offered no
competition at all, bowing before
Troy to the pitiful score of 53 to 0.
Maybe the Bears have looked
powerful in their last two encoun
ters, but they will certainly have to
show a whole lot more il they ex
pect to become a serious threat to
the teams remaining on the balance
of their schedule. And il will have
to be P.D.Q.
Graham MacNamee, popular
radio announcer, got a little too
excited when describing the
Army-Harvard game last Sat
urday. Late in the fourth quar
ter a Harvard halfback inter
cepted an Army pass and ran
20 or 30 yards before he was
brought down.
"Soandso is running down the
middle of the lieid to beat hell,"
shouted .MacNamee as the play
er almost broke into the open.
''Well, anyway, lie was in a
hurry," said Graham in smooth
ing out his error a little later.
A Stanford rooting section in the
majority of instances fails to become
unduly disturbed over the misfor
tunes of football or the breaks of
the game. Saturday, however, such
was not the case, and very anxious
murmurs arose from the section
when Moffatt was helped off the
field with what seemed to be a
badly injured ankle. Moffatt, the
most consistent yardage consumer
on the squad, has become in regard
to Stanford's hopes in the coming
contest with the U.S.C. 'o be almost
synonymous with victory. The alarm
over the withdrawal of Moffatt, al
though perhaps justifiable at the
time, has proven needless, because
he was not seriously injured, and it
is a certainty that he will be in the
lineup for the U.S.C. game.
