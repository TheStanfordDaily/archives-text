# Fast Bakersfield Outfit Humbles Babes 16-0
## PASS OFFENSE OF SOUTHERN ELEVEN PROVES EFFECTIVE Jaysee Men Have Added Scoring Punch During Fairly Even Tilt 
### Spud Hamilton 
| Stanford's freshmen went down 1
to a 16 to 0 defeat before the tricky !
ground and aerial thrusts of a
I scrapping Bakersfield J.C. grid team
: Saturday.
The invaders, coached by "Spud"
Marder, employed a Warner "B" j
I formation attack with impressive !
! results. On a varied assortment of
plays, Tyack, O'Connor, and the vest
; of the boys in the Jaysee backfield
I handed the ball around to everyone
j but the referee. Even when they
I were smeared for losses those
i Bakersfield plays looked pretty.
Strong Air Attack
The frosh checked the running |
plays effectively but the Bakersfield
men worked the ball down the field
1 for long gains via the air route. The
i Stanford backs seemingly were un
j able to cover their men.
It was an up and down affair, the
I ball scuttling rapidly back and forth
between the twenty-yard lines, with
1 only Bakersfield possessing that final
I punch needed to score.
Card Seconds Weak
! The Cards started with a second
I team and Bakersfield went through
! them like soup through a fork. The
Indian babes opened up with a 5-
yard gain off tackle and then Tyack
loosed a pass to Beauchamp that
carried to the Stanford 36-yard line.
; Another pass, O'Connor hurling to
: Tyack, gained 26 yards, and Bakers
! field was on Stanford's 10-yard line.
| O'Connor carried the ball over on
• a series of bucks. Bakersfield did
not convert.
Shortly after the kick-off Flippen's
pass was intercepted and within a
few plays it was first and ten on
Stanford's 4-yard line. Tyack failed
; to gain as the quarter ended.
Babe Regulars Hold
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw rushed
! in a flock of regulars. They made a
magnificent stand and held Bakers
field without gain in three more
downs. Moore was roughed on the
! following kick and the referee gave
the ball to the frosh on their own
twenty.
After the half Higginbothan scored
j from the nine-yard line for Bakers
field after two long passes, O'Connor
, to Tyack and Tyack to Mcßratney,
had netted 44 yards and placed the
oval in position.
Following this Stanford made their
best drive of the day with Moore
and Seaver slipping through for con
-1 stant gains. Their advance was halt
|ed en the Jaysee 10-yard stripe
when Higginbothan pulled Seaver's
• pass out of the air and raced back
. to his own 40-yard line.
