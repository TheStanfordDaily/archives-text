# HOW POP FOOLED HARVARD
## Warner's Carlisle Indian Team Pulled the Hunchback Hidden Ball Trick on Harvard in 1903 
### Feg Murray, â€™16 
Two popular magazines, on the j
j newstands at the same time recently, ,
! each carried football stories that re- i
! told the famous incident of Charlie
Dillon's "hunchback" run against ,
'Harvard in 1903. But it is interest-.|
( ing to note that one author, a fam- 1
I ous referee, differs widely in nis !
| version of the affair from the story
! as told by the other author, a fam- t
, ous coach. Both were present at the
1 game in question, one as an official
| at the game, the other as coach of .
j the losing team.
Both authors agree on certain'
phases of the play but differ widely j
j on others. For instance, says Mike
Thompson, the referee: 'Harvard
' scored first." Says Pop Warner, the
Indians' coach: "Carlisle's speed
scored five points almost at the out
set." Both writers then agree that i
Harvard kicked off, that Jimmie
Johnson, Indian quarterback, re
l ceived the ball on the 5-yard line, |

[ and, as his teammates grouped
, around him, tucked it up unde l- -
i neath the back of Charlie Dillon's
j jersey. Now listen:
j "'Go!' yelled Johnson." (this by
j Pop Warner.) "And the Carlisle
! players scattered and fanned out
! towai'd the side lines, each back
hugging his helmet to his breast,
i while Dillon charged straight down
the center of the field." Now hear
Mr. Thompson: "The V wedge lm
i mediately was in motion toward
I Harvard .... drawing in all ihe
' Harvard team, including the safety
j man. As the first of the Crimson
impact met the wedge, Dillon de
tached himself and eased toward the
sideline, traveling slowly until he
was clear. When Harvard finally
brought the wedge down in a heap,
i one of the Indians fell with what
appeared to be the ball in his arms,
but actually was his headgear. All
1 Harvard piled on top of him."
