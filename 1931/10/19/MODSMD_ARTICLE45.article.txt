# PENNANT SEEN IN INDIANS' 3-2 WIN OVER SAN MATEO
## Jim Mearns' Brilliant Play At Outside Right Features Game 
### 
Hopes for a championship soccer
team took a very decided rise on
Saturday morning when Harry Ma
loney's Redshirts defeated the
muchly touted San Mateo outfit by
a 3-2 score on the latter's field.
Although the Indians have not yet
achieved smoothness in their attack,
which may be seen by the end of
the season, the defensive work of
the fulls and the goalie leaves hard
ly anything to be desired from the
most fanatic Farm rooter.
J.C. Forwards Strong
The Bulldog's forward wall, which
is unquestionably one of the strong
est in the conference, was held
scoreless in the second half, and was
only able to push across two tallies
in the first periodâ€”one of the goals
being a decided fluke.
Knocked completely out from a
hard shot from a San Matean for
ward, Webster, Stanford goalie, was
I unable to prevent a score when one
! of the Bulldogs tapped the bail into
i the net as it lay before the uprights'
With a perfect corner kick and a
beautiful sideline pass, both of which
j resulted in scores, from the agile
| toe of Art Hearn, Bill Mearns an
! swered the prayer of Stanford soc
j cer enthusiasts for a brilliant out
i side forward.
I , Winning Tally
Going into the second half with
the count all even Ihe Redshirts put
i on a drive which resulted in a goal
by Captain Karl Falk, who during
most of the game did not show what
previous years indicated he was
capable of in the way of accurate
i playing.
I Considering that San Mateo has
| already defeated California, the
I chances for a series win over the
, Bears this year* seem brighter than
I ever for the Indians, who have not
I only showed an encouraging amount
i of spirit but also have demonstrated
that they will improve from game
to game as the season progresses.
