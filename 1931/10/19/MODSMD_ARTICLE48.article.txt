# Campus Outboard Expert To Enter Southern Events
## 
### 
Unknown to a large section of the
Stanford student body, outboard
motorboat racing lias found its way
into the Indian list of sports in a
big, if unofficial, way.
Robert P. McCulloch, Stanford
i senior, took two second places in
j the national outboard champion-
I ships held at Lake Mcrritt, Oakland,
October 10, 11, and 12, and narrow -
jly missed capturing the covctcd
i Lorimer Trophy.
j McCulloch raced two years un
officially for Princeton, and repre
-1 sented Stanford in the same capa
i city, after his transfer here, at the
; intercollegiate championships in
New York last June 19.
; He will take his three motors, in
| eluding two Johnsons and an Evin
! rude, to the forthcoming Salton Sea
; races, where practically the entire
! group of between 100 and 150
! drivers who participated in the
Oakland events will race in an at.-
, tempt to break a number of world's
! records. A special train which
! brought most of the boats from the
I East will not leave the coast until
] after the Salton Sea affair.
; The southern racing area is par
ticularly adapted to the outboard
j sport, having a very high water
t density and high barometric pres
j sure. These features allow of less
i propeller slippage and better engine
j performance.
