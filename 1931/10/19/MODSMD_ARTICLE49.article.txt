# TENNIS LADDER CONFUSION SLOWLY CLEARING UP AS PLAY PROGRESSES
## 
### 
Positions are changing fast and
furiously during these first weeks
of tennis ladder play, with many
places rather temporarily set due to
the fact that few know just exactly
where they stand in relation to
other players. This is especially true
of the freshmen, who have not yet
had an opportunity to size up their
own class on the courts.
Willi all I his confusion, a few
matches have been played in (he
past few days to partially clear up
the standings. Last week Kelsey
Petterson successfully defended his
third place on the varsity squad
against Hubert Butler, number four.
The score was 6-1, 1-6, 6-2.
Dan Ellis finally succeeded in
conquering the man who continually
held him off last year on the fresh
man squad when he beat Monte
Shwayder rather easily, 6-2, 6-1, to
put himself in sixth position. Like
wise John Gordon advanced a rung
by defeating Bob Rhodes by a 6-3,
6-0 score, placing himself in eighth
position. Another man lost his place
when French dropped a thi'ee-set
match to Reed, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, to fall
to tenth place.
Farther down the list A1 Bogan,
number fourteen, defaulted to
George Bergstrom, one place below
| him, and Edwards defeated Young
I to hold onto sixteenth place, 4-6,

8-6, G-3. Two more places changed
| hands when Bill Wentworth, for
merly number 18, took the measure
lof Kdley Thorpe to advance one
rung, and Haehl won over Fidenque
by a 2-(5, G-3, 9-7 score.
Four hundred treasure-seekers
struggled to stake claims in a new
area of Alberta's foothills in which
a gold strike was recently discov
ered.
