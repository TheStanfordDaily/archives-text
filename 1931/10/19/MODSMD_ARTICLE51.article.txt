the Women's Clubhouse, announces
Bob Jones, president, for the dis
cussion of reorganization and plans
for the coming year.
The main topic for discussion will
be whether or not the Fellowship
activities should be continued. "This
cannot be done," Jones says, with
out a more vigorous faculty anil
student support, so it is most im
portant that students express their
views on the matter." Under the
main topic matters of finance, con

the homes of professors will be
yiven attention.
Members of last year's board and
all other interested faculty members
