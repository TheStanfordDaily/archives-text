ROOSEVELT FIELD, L.1., Oct. 18 j
(A 3 ) — Mrs. Verner Reed, Jr., New
York society matron, takes no J
chances with the germs that lurk in
big cities when she and her two
young sons go traveling.
Rather than pass through New '
York City by train when she was
taking the lads—Verner and Peter —
from Sea Edge, her Newport, R.1.,
summer home, to Pinehurst N.C.,
for the winter, she chartered a
plane and made the trip by air.
