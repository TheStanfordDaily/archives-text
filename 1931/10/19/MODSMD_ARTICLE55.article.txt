# UNIVERSITY CHAMP MAY NOT BE GIVEN GENE TUNNEY MEDAL
## 
### 
Contrary to precedent, the Gene
Tunney boxing medals will not ne
cessarily be awarded this season to
the all-University champion, ac
cording to Coach Harry Maloney,
minor sports director. In their place,
however, gold medals will be award
ed. as in the past.
This year the Tunney medal will
be given the man who, in the opin
ion of the coach, manager, and cap
tain, has been of the most service
to the team. In making this deci
sion, the candidate's attitude, his
progress in the sport and his stand
ing as a sportsman will be taken
into consideration.
The award will be made in any
class, from bantam to heavyweight,
Coach Maloney announced. In mak
ing this radical change those in
charge believe that the man most
deserving of the medal will receive
it. He may be the University cham
pion or he may only be a member
of the squad who has proven his
worth in the above-mentioned
qualities.
