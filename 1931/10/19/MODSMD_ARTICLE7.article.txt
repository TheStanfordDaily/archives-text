# BRAZIL GOVERNMENT TO PAY ALL LOANS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 18. (/Pi â€” A j
statement from the Brazilian Gov- I
1 ernment saying it would pay all j
i loans except funding loans of 1898 J
and 1914 in special scrip was made j
public here by Sebastian Sampaio, j
Brazil's consul general.
The sinking fund and interest on j
the 5 per cent funding loans of j
I those two years will be paid in cash, ;
the statement said. The action is |
being taken, it was explained, be- |
I cause of "the impossibility of ac- j
quiring foreign exchange for the |
transfer of funds to the markets |
where the coupons of the external |
I debt are payable." ,
The scrip, bearing interest at 5 j
j per cent, will be divided into two !
I series.
