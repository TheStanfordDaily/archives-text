YORKTOWN, Va., Oct. 19. (JP)—
Standing before 30,000 persons on

here to an official end, the Presi

Historic Setbacks
"The unparalleled rise of America
has not been the result of riches in
lands, forests, or mines; it sprung
from the ideals which liberated
mines and stimulated the spirits of
men.
"In those ideas and ideals is the
sole hope of the people. No Ameri
can can review this vast pageant
of progress without care and faith,
without courage, strength, and reso
lution for the future."
Mrs. Hoover on Platform
Hoover spoke to an outdoor audi

emy may step within our borders.
Washington Won War
"While temporary dislocations
have come to us because of the
World War, we must not forget that
our forefathers met similar obstacles
to progress time and again, and yet
the nation has swept forward to
ever inci-easing strength No
American can review this vast pa
geant of progress without confidence
and faith, without courage, strength,
and resolution for the future."

The Chief Executive asserted that
without Washington "the war for
independence would not have been
won."
