# DAVIS TO SPEAK ON FARM BOARD
## Economic Discussion To Be Given This Evening 
### 
Now the director of the Food Re
search Institute here, and formerly
Chief Economist of the Federal
Farm Board, Dr. Joseph S. Davis
has a wide background for his talk
this evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall on "Sidelights on
the Farm Board."
Dr. Davis, who will discuss in his
talk the economic rather than the
political aspects of the Farm Board,
went to Washington in the latter
part of 1929 on a leave of absence
from the position which he has oc
cupied since 1921 as Food Research
Director of Stanford. He organized
and developed an economic staff for
the Farm Board and acted as eco
nomic counsel. One of his principal
works was to develop channels of
information in conjunction with the
Departments of Agriculture and
Commerce.
The future of the Federal Farm
Board, the promotion of co-opera
ing the fanner, the adjustment of
production, the control and preven
tion of surpluses, the reduction of
wheat and cotton acreage, and all
the larger aspects of the agricul
tural problems of the United States
will be dwelt on by Dr. Davis.
Tonight's speaker taught eco
nomics at Harvard after receiving
his Ph.D. there, and since has had
a varied career in the field of eco
nomic research. He has been con
tributing editor and writer for a
number of magazines dealing with
economics, he is author and co
author of a dozen books, and during
the war he occupied one of the im
portant statistical positions in the
field of marine economics.
