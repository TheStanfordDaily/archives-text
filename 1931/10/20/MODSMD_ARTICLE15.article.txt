# CAPONE WINS VERDICT HALT IN NEW FRAY
## U.S. To Make Determined Move To Get Income Tax Fraud Dues 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 19. (JP) — More
trouble was brewing in the Federal
building today for "Scarface Al"
Capone, Chicago gang leader, and
his friends.
Capone's sentence on his convic
tion for violating income tax laws
was delayed at least three more
days as Federal Judge James H.
Wilkeyson granted his attorneys un
til Friday to perfect their argu
ments for an arrest of judgment.
If this bit of procrastination could
be considered as favorable to the
gang chief it was more than offset
by word that the Government had
begun in earnest its attempt to col
lect the tax Capone tried to evade.
May Attach Goods
The criminal proceeding which
resulted in his conviction Saturday
night did not alter the Govern
ment's claim that he owed some
$215,000 in tax, and whatever can
be traced to his ownership may be
seized.
Johnny Torrio, Capone's friend
and predecessor as head man of the
city's gangs, went up to the United
States District Attorney's office to
day and asked to be released from
the subpoena that brought him from
New York three weeks ago as a
Government witness. He did not tes
tify for either side during the trial
and he said he wanted to go home.
Torrio's Story Checked
But the Government officers re
fused and it was subsequently
learned that Torrio's Grand Jury
testimony was being checked care
fully with the facts brought out in
the trial. Another former Chicago
gangster who came back under Fed
eral persuasion and appeared be
fore the Grand Jury has already
been charged with perjury.
He is "Two-Gun Louie" Alterie,
now a Colorado ranchman, and
prosecutors said Torrio would un
doubtedly face a similar charge if
his testimony were found to have
been untrue.
Capone's companion and body
guard, Philip O'Andrea, made an
other brief appearance in Judge
Wilkerson's court, as his contempt
of court hearing was continued for
the fourth time—this time until
Thursday.
