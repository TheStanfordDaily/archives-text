# THRONGS PAY RESPECTS AT EDISON'S BIER
## Wizard Often Gave Credit To Divine Intelligence, Associate Claims 
### 
WEST ORANGE, N.J., Oct. 19. iA>)
—For a brief moment at midday
today mourners stopped a continu
ous file past the bier of Thomas A.
Edison—a minister offered a prayer.
The convocation was uttered by
Mrs. Edison's pastor, the Reverend
Arthur H. Brown of the Methodist
Church of Orange, at her request.
Mr. Edison's body lay in a bronze
casket in a niche of the pine-pan
eled, high ceilinged library of his
laboratory. Autumn leaves covered
the bier.
Has No Creed
For a second time since Mr. Edi
son's death early Sunday, Arthur L.
Walsh, vice-president of Thomas A.
Edison Industries, Inc., said the in
ventor was not an atheist, even
though he acknowledged no specific
creed.
Walsh recalled that once as he
sat with Mr. Edison in the labora
tory, the latter said: "Sometimes
when I've reached the end of my
rope in an experiment, suddenly
there will come a thought that is
the key to my problem. Certainly
that supreme intelligence guides the
human mind."
Funeral Private
Wednesday there will be a private
funeral, and Mr. Edison will be
buried in Rosedale Cemetery at
Orange, not many miles from his
hilltop home. President Hoover
hopes to attend the services, but has
been unable to plan definitely.
Public mourners numbered thou
sands, and they wei'e polygot. There
were bankers in cutaways, school
children carrying their books, old
persons who wept freely, unem
ployed in threadbare clothing, Sal
vation Army corps, mothers with
babies in arms. Some younger em
ployees of the Edison plant who
never had seen the inventor filed
past the bier two and three times.
