# Peace Negotiations Advance As Chiang's Downfall Imminent
## Japan Withdraws Objection To U.S. Intervention In Manchurian Fracas 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19. (/P) —
Japan now is willing for the United
States to sit with the League of Na
tions council a& it tries to solve the
Manchurian puzzle.
Understanding more clearly the
American position, the Japanese
government today withdrew her
previous objections. Orders from
Tokyo sent Ambassador Debuchi to
the State Department with assur
ances for Secretary Stimson that
Japan no longer would oppose
American participation.
The objections were withdrawn
while the American Government
was still awaiting formal notification
of the invocation of the Kellogg-
Briand anti-war treaty by five other
leading nations.
Encouraging Outlook
The action by the powers was
taken in an atmosphere of encour
agement due to continued absence
of i*eports of future hostilities in
Manchuria. Hesitant to appear
overhasty in calling attention of
China and Japan to obligations un
der the anti-war treaty, the Ameri
can Government decided to await
notification of such action first by
others.
The Japanese withdrew opposi
tion to American participation at
Geneva after Debuchi at Stimson's
request had explained to Tokyo the
exact status of Prentice B. Gilbert,
American Consul General at Geneva,
who is sitting with the League coun
cil.
Japan Reserves Rights
Gilberts instructions were to par
ticipate only in discussions regard
ing the possible invocation of the
anti-war treaty, of which the United
States is a signatory.
Informing the Secretary of the
action, the Ambassador added that
his government still reserved the
right to object to judicial points so
far as the league was concerned.
These include the Japanese conten
lion that the league should not in
terfere in the dispute.
Troops Being Withdrawn
On the basis of official dispatches,
the Ambassador told the Secretary
(hat no hostilities had been reported
to Tokyo for several days. Some
contingents of troops were already
being withdrawn into Korea over
the Yalu river, he said. Bombing
contingents had been replaced with
scouting planes and communications,
railways, and banks were reopening
in the affected areas.
