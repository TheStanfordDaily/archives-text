# VARSITY STARS HURT IN LONG DRILL SESSION
## Cadel And Bigelow Receive Shoulder Injuries In Tackle Practice BOTH OUT FOR A WEEK Grey And Gribben Return; Other Men Better 
### Jack Jernegan 
"What are we going to do now?"
"Oh, I guess we'll go out and beat
J each other over the head with club*
j now!"
I don't know who put the ques
j tion, but Jack Hillman made the
answer, and he pretty well ex
pressed the feelings of a muchly
battered collection of varsity football
men who had just gotten through
smashing each other to the ground
in tackling practice yesterday after
; noon.
The boys had had a rough time
for awhile, for Pop Warner set out
to remedy the weakness noted in
! Saturday's Oregon State contest by
making the entire squad take turns
j at running with the ball and bring
j ing the ball-carrier down.
Slight Injuries
Although necessary, it was a
rather costly session, bccause Windy
| Bigelow and Ernie Caddel receipted
! for wallops which will keep them
out of competition for a week or
! more.
Bigelow tried to knock down a
| goal post and thereby dislocated his
shoulder, while Caddel also took
one on the shoulder but got off with
1 nothing worse than a loosened
clavicle bone. Windy isn't likely to
' see any action before the U.C.L.A.
i tilt a week from Saturday, but Ernie
! may be O.K. in time for the Wash
! ington game at Seattle this coming
1 week-end.
Injured Players Cack
I Developments ran largely to in
jured or ex-injured payers yester
day, with Phil MofTatt taking the
day off, Grey and Gribbin returned
! to active service, Ned Clark out of
the hospital, and Phil Neill promis
ing to ditch his poison oak by today.
Although Clark intends to be in
I uniform this afternoon, he can hard
ily be ready to take his place in n
game before the U.C.L.A. encoun
! tei\ Neill and Molfatt ought to bo
i as good as ever in a day or two.
Chuck Winterburn, backfield
I coach, came back from Seattle yes
| erday with some dope on Washing
ton's Huskies. According to Chuck,
I Ihe northerners arc a mighty rugged
| bunch of football players, and they
include in their number a large as
! sortment of high-class backs.
Sohn Reported Good
A young man named Sohn caught
Winterburn's eye particularly by his
| lashing method of handling punts
on the dead run. When Sohn starts
! coming back up the field with a
punt in his arms it is time for all
i of the opponents to rally round in
a hurry, so says Chuck.
Aside from the tackling practice,
1 yesterday's workout was devoid of
excitement, but the aforesaid Lack
i ling was rough enough to satisfy
I the most exacting. The athletes were
: throwing each other around with as
: much viciousness as if it had been
a real game. Pop gave them every
kind of condition which might be
met on the field, sending the run
; ners in from all angles.

Chuck Winterburn, backfield
I coach, came back from Seattle yes
| erday with some dope on Washing
ton's Huskies. According to Chuck,
I Ihe northerners arc a mighty rugged
| bunch of football players, and they
include in their number a large as
! sortment of high-class backs.
Sohn Reported Good
A young man named Sohn caught
Winterburn's eye particularly by his
| lashing method of handling punts
on the dead run. When Sohn starts
! coming back up the field with a
punt in his arms it is time for all
i of the opponents to rally round in
a hurry, so says Chuck.
Aside from the tackling practice,
1 yesterday's workout was devoid of
excitement, but the aforesaid Lack
i ling was rough enough to satisfy
I the most exacting. The athletes were
: throwing each other around with as
: much viciousness as if it had been
a real game. Pop gave them every
kind of condition which might be
met on the field, sending the run
; ners in from all angles.
"What are we going to do now?"
"Oh, I guess we'll go out and beat
J each other over the head with club*
j now!"
I don't know who put the ques
j tion, but Jack Hillman made the
answer, and he pretty well ex
pressed the feelings of a muchly
battered collection of varsity football
men who had just gotten through
smashing each other to the ground
in tackling practice yesterday after
; noon.
The boys had had a rough time
for awhile, for Pop Warner set out
to remedy the weakness noted in
! Saturday's Oregon State contest by
making the entire squad take turns
j at running with the ball and bring
j ing the ball-carrier down.
Slight Injuries
Although necessary, it was a
rather costly session, bccause Windy
| Bigelow and Ernie Caddel receipted
! for wallops which will keep them
out of competition for a week or
! more.
Bigelow tried to knock down a
| goal post and thereby dislocated his
shoulder, while Caddel also took
one on the shoulder but got off with
1 nothing worse than a loosened
clavicle bone. Windy isn't likely to
' see any action before the U.C.L.A.
i tilt a week from Saturday, but Ernie
! may be O.K. in time for the Wash
! ington game at Seattle this coming
1 week-end.
Injured Players Cack
I Developments ran largely to in
jured or ex-injured payers yester
day, with Phil MofTatt taking the
day off, Grey and Gribbin returned
! to active service, Ned Clark out of
the hospital, and Phil Neill promis
