Last week Abe Mellinkoff, Bull Sessioner, pointed out
that Southern California was embarking on a scholastic
experiment by admitting 70 students whose high school
recommendations were not up to the university's standard.
Mellinkoff called attention to the probability that those 70
men would number among them many athletes.
Southern California authorities have protested unoffi
cially to Stanford upon the interpretation that Mellinkoff
placed upon their experiment. They declare that one of
the provisions of the plan forever bars any ot the 70 ad
mitted from participating in intercollegiate athletics.
For that interpretation the Daily apologizes. But it also
takes the liberty to slate that Mellinkoff received his in
formation about the "experiment" from the editorial col
umns of the Daily Trojan, student newspaper of the I iii
versity of Southern California. The cdtiorial said, in part:
"Students in the group (of 70) who make grades of between
B's and C's or higher, during their first year in college, will
he advanced next year to regular university standing."
The Daily believes that Mellinkoff was justified in tak
ing the phrase "regular university standing" to mean eli
gibility for athletics, and that he was justified in accepting
the Trojan's word as correct. However, the entire incident
was a regrettable one, and the Daily deeply regrets its part
in it.
