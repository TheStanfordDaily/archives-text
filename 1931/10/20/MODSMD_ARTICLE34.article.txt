# COLDS AND COMMON SENSE
## 
### 
Although no one has heard of an official campaign
being launched with "A cold for everyone on campus" as
its slogan and goal, the depressing prevalence of colds at
present almost calls for some such explanation.
At a casual estimate, half the students either have colds,
or are recovering from one, or are in tlie process of catch
ing 'one. The remainder of the students have so many
friends suffering from the epidemic that their own chances
of escaping ate more than slim.
If inconvenience and gonenal unpleasantness were
alone attendant upon colds, they would be bad enough.
Rut the lowering of efficiency, and the almost complete loss
of ambition and the ability to exert one's self in any direc
tion, and the loss of the power of concentration and appli
cation, that are also attendant upon colds make them a
formidable liability.
Colds are not inevitable. Common sense and a few
simple precautions are all that are needed to keep well. It
is not common sense to wait until twelve o'clock Sunday
night to write the essay due at eight o'clock Monday morn
ing, nor to wait until one o'clock Friday morning to do the
week's collateral reading and prepare for an examination
on Friday. It is this sort of thing, however, which, by de
vitalizing their resistance, causes students to succumb so
easily to a cold epidemic.
