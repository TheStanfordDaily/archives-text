						PLEA FOR CONSERVATION
## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of tlie Interior, |
speaking recently before the Commonwealth Club of San :
Francisco, sounded a warning that western states must co
operate to save their natural resources.
"We hear talk of five-vear plans, twenty-year plans,
and so on. We must plan for 100 years ahead it' we are to
be assured of stable homes, prosperous valleys, forests, j
and ample streams from our mountains," he declared, j
'Our own actions and lack of foresight arc bringing us j
destruction at the edges of our civilization. The desert i
once pushed back is again claiming its own. Here we must
tight against the lack of vegetation and seek the control of
water to overcome the general aridity of climate." Waste-1
tul cutting of timber, over grazing, forest fires, lack ot
common sense in irrigation laws, were among the causes
cited by Dr. Wilbur as being destructive to economic prog- |
ress.
The terrible total of destruction caused by forest fires I
during the past summer should be enough to convince the j
people of the West that Dr. Wilbur is right. Some of these
fires are set by firebugs and others are the result of natural
causes, but by far the greatest majority of all of them are |
caused by human carelessness. The people must be edu
cated to the fact that our great forests are back of the j
entire economic development of the West, not only for I
their timber value, but because they control the flow of j
water in streams and make irrigation and reclamation of
arid lands possible.
Scientific forestry as taught in modern eolelges and uni
versiites is beginning to show its beneficial effects on our
national forests, and each year tlrese benefits will increase.
However, it must not be forgotten that one forest fire can
do enough damage to more than offset all benefits of scien
tific forestry. In order to improve the forests we must first
save them, and this depends upon the co-operation of all.
