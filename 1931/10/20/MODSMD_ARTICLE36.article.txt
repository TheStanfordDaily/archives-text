# BULL SESSION
## APROPOS OF WOMEN'S INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 
### 
My dear Mr. Mellinkoff:
I)o you realize that the Big
Pink Machine you so eloquently
described in the Daily is in
reality four class teams that
practice three hours a week?
You say, "It is not any feeling
of superiority or masculine ego
tism that prompts this writer's
views," yet you base those
views on the effects of inter
collegiate athletics on "feminine"
charm. This point of view sug
gests purely subjective think
ing, which, as every Cit. student
knows, is not conducive to sound
conclusions.
"Man's slave and chattel for
years and even centuries,
womankind cannot break the
"chains" that bind them to their
horrible existence until you and
your kind relinquish your ideals
of "the demure, the petite, and
the feminine in modern woman
hood."

My dear Miss Millard:
I do and did realize that the Big
Pink Machine will be put out in
four body styles — namely: the
"Freshman Four-door," the "Souho
more Sedan," the "Junior Jump-in,"
and the "Senior Sag-in." It was also
common knowledge that these teams
are to practice but three hours per
week. However, let's pause a mo
ment. The purpose of this new pol
icy is to awaken more sports in
terest among the "500"; if the plan
succeeds, is it not likely that the
women will practice longer than the
present hours that are already de
voted to gym work?
Furthermore, if Mills was to
will soon increase training hours
and bring to the Big Pink Machine

' all those accessories that will soon
I change it from a meandering and
| unassuming vehicle dedicated to
!spcrt to one of these super-super
| straight-sixteen-two-carburetor af
j practice ten hours per week; and
■ as a result, Stanford women were
j severely beaten, wouldn't campus
i ballyhoo pierce Roble and Row to
the effect that more practice is
needed? Or on the other hand, do
| you believe that the "500'' are such
I an eccentric, cold-blooded, unusual
group that ridiculous defeats would
l have no effect on them? If this is
| the case, then intercollegiate sports
| will not increase interest; and if this
! is not the case—that is if the "500"'
| are normal—then the desire to win
i fairs.
Of course, not being a Cit. stu-
I dent, I do not know that subjective
; thinking is not conducive to sound
conclusions; on the contrary some
i of the greatest minds in history
I were almost entirely subjective. And
[ furthermore while warning me that
j my conclusions will not be sound,
i you fail to tell me why fearing that
j emphasized sport - may not destroy
feminine charm—the delicate and
j the fine that is or should be their
1 greatest asset. And still furthermore,
| there is nothing subjective in "femi-
I nine" charm! I am talking objective
j ly; very objectively. Look or talk
! to the average woman athlete; it
j will soon become evident that some
thing is lacking objectively.
And lastly, that stuff about chains
and misery was supposed to be sar
casm. If woman is in misery today,
I then man's unfortunate position de
i fies description. Hoping that your
wrists and ankles are not too chafed
from your bonds, I beg to remain,
Woman's greatest defender,

My dear Miss Millard:
I do and did realize that the Big
Pink Machine will be put out in
four body styles — namely: the
"Freshman Four-door," the "Souho
more Sedan," the "Junior Jump-in,"
and the "Senior Sag-in." It was also
common knowledge that these teams
are to practice but three hours per
week. However, let's pause a mo
ment. The purpose of this new pol
icy is to awaken more sports in
terest among the "500"; if the plan
succeeds, is it not likely that the
women will practice longer than the
present hours that are already de
voted to gym work?
Furthermore, if Mills was to
will soon increase training hours
and bring to the Big Pink Machine

' all those accessories that will soon
I change it from a meandering and
| unassuming vehicle dedicated to
!spcrt to one of these super-super
| straight-sixteen-two-carburetor af
j practice ten hours per week; and
■ as a result, Stanford women were
j severely beaten, wouldn't campus
i ballyhoo pierce Roble and Row to
the effect that more practice is
needed? Or on the other hand, do
| you believe that the "500'' are such
I an eccentric, cold-blooded, unusual
group that ridiculous defeats would
l have no effect on them? If this is
| the case, then intercollegiate sports
| will not increase interest; and if this
! is not the case—that is if the "500"'
| are normal—then the desire to win
i fairs.
Of course, not being a Cit. stu-
I dent, I do not know that subjective
; thinking is not conducive to sound
conclusions; on the contrary some
i of the greatest minds in history
I were almost entirely subjective. And
[ furthermore while warning me that
j my conclusions will not be sound,
i you fail to tell me why fearing that
j emphasized sport - may not destroy
feminine charm—the delicate and
j the fine that is or should be their
1 greatest asset. And still furthermore,
| there is nothing subjective in "femi-
I nine" charm! I am talking objective
j ly; very objectively. Look or talk
! to the average woman athlete; it
j will soon become evident that some
thing is lacking objectively.
And lastly, that stuff about chains
and misery was supposed to be sar
casm. If woman is in misery today,
