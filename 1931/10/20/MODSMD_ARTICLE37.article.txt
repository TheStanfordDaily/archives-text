IF I WERE YOU—By P. G. Wode- |
house. Garden City, N.Y. Double
day, Doran. 1931.
Says Heywood Broun, "I think it :
no small thing to be the most read- !
able writer of this day and age." j
"Learn a paragraph and start I
your dinner partners choking on
the soup."—Mr. Ogden Nash.
These jacket blurbs are, for once, j
justifiable. "If I Were You" is all j

about the ramifications that resulted
when his governess switched the
baby Earl of Droitwich with her
own son. The book is full of chuckles
of the inimitable Wodehouse variety.
We hope, incidentally, that Jeeves
has not "arrived at the crux or
kernel" of all Archie's situations be
cause, although this book is very
diverting, it has not the same spon
taneous quality that made the

! Jeeves-series superior to all mod- !
1 ern humor stories. We hope with
I Archie that it isn't "toodle-doo
j Jeeves." -E.T.P.

! SCARAMOUCHE THE KING
i MAKER—By Rafael Sabatini.
Houghton Mifflin. 1931. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Heretical, we are quite willing to
j crown Signor Sabatini king of his
torical romancers in place of obese
Alexander Dumas. Overloaded with
unnecessary detail, written unsimply
I with characters mis-shapen into
i grotesques, Dumas, it seems to us,
' has reigned long enough.
To be sure, he has created a few
i memorable characters: D'Artagnan
j &nd his comrades, an unhistorical
; Catherine de Medici, a widely en
i joyable Edmond Dantes; but so has
j Sabatini—and more rationally. His
! Caesare Borgia is more truthfully
| portrayed than the M. Dumas' biood
| lusting whooper, his Scaramouche is
| reasonable, and not dull. The slight
;ly satiric leer which characterizes
1 his style is amusing. Yes, setting
: aside tradition, Rafael, the crown
j is yours. —J.S.S.

! SCARAMOUCHE THE KING
i MAKER—By Rafael Sabatini.
Houghton Mifflin. 1931. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Heretical, we are quite willing to
j crown Signor Sabatini king of his
torical romancers in place of obese
Alexander Dumas. Overloaded with
unnecessary detail, written unsimply
I with characters mis-shapen into
i grotesques, Dumas, it seems to us,
' has reigned long enough.
To be sure, he has created a few
i memorable characters: D'Artagnan
j &nd his comrades, an unhistorical
; Catherine de Medici, a widely en
i joyable Edmond Dantes; but so has
j Sabatini—and more rationally. His
! Caesare Borgia is more truthfully
| portrayed than the M. Dumas' biood
| lusting whooper, his Scaramouche is
| reasonable, and not dull. The slight
;ly satiric leer which characterizes
1 his style is amusing. Yes, setting
: aside tradition, Rafael, the crown
j is yours. —J.S.S.
IF I WERE YOU—By P. G. Wode- |
house. Garden City, N.Y. Double
day, Doran. 1931.
Says Heywood Broun, "I think it :
no small thing to be the most read- !
able writer of this day and age." j
"Learn a paragraph and start I
your dinner partners choking on
the soup."—Mr. Ogden Nash.
These jacket blurbs are, for once, j
justifiable. "If I Were You" is all j

about the ramifications that resulted
when his governess switched the
baby Earl of Droitwich with her
own son. The book is full of chuckles
of the inimitable Wodehouse variety.
We hope, incidentally, that Jeeves
has not "arrived at the crux or
kernel" of all Archie's situations be
cause, although this book is very
diverting, it has not the same spon
taneous quality that made the

! Jeeves-series superior to all mod- !
1 ern humor stories. We hope with
I Archie that it isn't "toodle-doo
