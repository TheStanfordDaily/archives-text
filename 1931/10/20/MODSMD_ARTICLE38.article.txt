Dear Sir or Madam:
YOU owe the enclosed BILL. Why
do you not remit? It is no disgrace
to OWE bills. EVERYBODY owes
money. But it is a disgrace not to
PAY what you HONESTLY owe.

It is with regret that I did not
receive a dun from you in this
morning's mail. Doubtless this is an
oversight on your part and will be
promptly attended to. I wish to re
main on cordial relations with your
company, but you will realize that
if I am to be dunned I have evex*y
moral right to regular letters.
I was disappointed at the tone of
form letter c7. Of course it is not
WRONG to have to DUN me. THAT
is your JOB. But it IS wrong to
change from a G-r-r-rump tone
form to a Fire! Fire! on such short
notice. And may I compliment the
writer of your form a3 Gr-r-rump
letters as being far above the aver
age.
Might I suggest as an economy
measure that you mail me your
forthcoming forms in one letter,
thus saving your time and mine?

to OWE bills. EVERYBODY owes

Dear Sir or Sir:
It is with regret that I did not
receive a dun from you in this
morning's mail. Doubtless this is an
oversight on your part and will be
promptly attended to. I wish to re
main on cordial relations with your
company, but you will realize that
if I am to be dunned I have evex*y
moral right to regular letters.
I was disappointed at the tone of
form letter c7. Of course it is not
WRONG to have to DUN me. THAT
is your JOB. But it IS wrong to
change from a G-r-r-rump tone
form to a Fire! Fire! on such short
notice. And may I compliment the
writer of your form a3 Gr-r-rump
letters as being far above the aver
age.
Might I suggest as an economy
measure that you mail me your
forthcoming forms in one letter,
thus saving your time and mine?
