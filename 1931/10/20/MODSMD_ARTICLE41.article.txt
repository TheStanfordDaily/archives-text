Among the frosh elevens on the
coast the California Babes are near
ly as outstanding as the Trojans are
among the conference squads.
The Bears handed the U.S.C.
frosh a 23 to 0 trouncing last
Saturday, and, according to
Brick Morse, even this score did
not indicate the natural superi
ority of Hie Cal yearlings over
their rivals.
These Bear frosh seem to have
everything that Howard Jones
lias on his Trojan varsity. Chief
ly, they arc large and powerful.
Furthermore, they are excep
tionally well equipped with re
serve strength.
In Brick Morse's own words, "they
are the best crowd of football play
ers that ever entered the University
of California." And in only two
weeks Jimmy Bradshaw's babes
tangle with these Bear scalp hunters.
At the present time it looks rather
discouraging for the Cards. Last
Saturday they lost a hard-fought
conlest to Bakersfield J.C. by a score
of 1G to 0, one of the first defeats
Stanford frosh have suffered from a
junior college squad.
Stanford is weak in every de
partment in which the Bears are
strong, in the lirst place, the
entire team is exceedingly light.
Secondly, reserve material is
sadly lacking.
Whether they are in a class
with the Californians will he de
termined next Saturday after
they battle the U.S.C. frosh.
"St. Mary's won after a hard fight."
Such is the phrase used in de
scribing recent contests played by
1 lie Gaels against squads that are
scheduled by conference teams only
as breathers.
Tliv Gaels are still decidedly
outplaying their opponents, hut
apparently they are losing the
scoring punch they had in the
games with U.S.C. and Califor
nia. In Sunday's game the Mora
gans made yards from
scrimmage against San Fran
cisco University and were only
able to shove over two touch
downs.
Slip Madigan's crew must con
quer Oregon, the Olympic Club,
Santa Clara, and Southern
Methodist before they can lay
claim to the national title.
As far as comparative scores are
concerned. Stanford beat Oregon
State almost as badly as the Tro
jans did. But all who witnessed last
Saturday's affair agree that the In
dians were lucky to have maintained
the one touchdown lead they ob
tained in the first half.
