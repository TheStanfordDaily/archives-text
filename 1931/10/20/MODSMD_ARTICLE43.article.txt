# Bradshaw Prepares Frosh For S. C. Game
## INDIAN BABES ARE GIRDING LOINS FOR BATTLE SATURDAY U.S.C. Meet Finds Frosh Team Intact; Injured Have Recovered 
### Spud Hamilton 
Stanford's freshman football team
will dig their cleats with extra
i depth into the turf this week while
preparing an attack that they hope
I Will give the Trojan horse a very
bad case of heebie jeebies after the
, U.S.C.-Cardinal frosh meeting next
j Saturday.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw will have
his first team intact Saturday for
; the first time since the Los Angeles
J.C. tangle. All his ailing men have
definitely recovered and will ap
pear in action next Satui'day.
! Bowles and Rothert, who fill the
I difficult assignments at leftâ€žhalf for
1 the Indian Babes, were purposely
! held out of the fray with Bakers
field to insure them against injuries.
They are expected to alternate at
; the position against Troy.
U.S.C. Not Weak
The Bakersfield game brought out
j no salient facts except the weakness
of Stanford backs against deceptive
passing plays and the general weak
! ness of the reserve material,
i While U.S.C. took a powerful
I beating from a great California
| freshman crew Saturday, no one is
rating them as a weak team. The
j game merely proves what a superior
combination of first-year men they
have over at the Berkeley school
: this season. Even in losing, the Tro
j babes unreeled some very substan
tial gains, with a lad named War
[ burton, who substituted at quarter,
'compelling attention.
Good Running Attack
i Observers declare that in the mat
! ter of first downs, Southern Cali
[ fornia was not so greatly outclassed.
| The Bear Cubs chalked up 13 dur
i ing the afternoon, while Troy did
considerable rambling themselves
| to account for 11. Which all dove
| tails acceptably with the proverbial
j phrase that "no one ever saw a
j Southern California team that didn't
: have a powerful running attack."
From all appearances the Tro-
I babes are nobody's set-up and the
Cardinal youngsters can afford to
| give themselves a congratulatory
pat on the back if they bring home
a victory.
