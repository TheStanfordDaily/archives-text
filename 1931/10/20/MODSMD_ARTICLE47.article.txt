# FOOTBALL'S GRAND OLD MAN By Feg Murray, '16
## 
### 
Back in 1892 a young fellow who ]
j had made a name for himself as a j
j football and baseball player at Yale j
took up the duties as coach of the i
I football team at the University of !
Chicago. Benjamin Harrison was !
President then, and the automobile, I
i the moving picture, the radio, and i
Prohibition were unknown. Nobody j
I had ever heard of Ty Cobb, while j
I Bobby Jones, Babe Ruth, Bili Tildon, I
j and Helen Wills weren't even born.
! Jim Corbett was the new heavy- j
! weight champion of the world.
} The young wellow's name was j
; Amos Alonzo Stagg—yessir, the j
| same Stagg who is now coaching at j
I the same university on the Midway, j
I This is "The Old Man's" fortieth j
; season, and he celebrated his 69'h j
j birthday about a month ago by j
: playing some tennis with his son.
One offspring, by the way, Paul I
Stagg, is quarterback of this year's '

| University of Chicago 'team. One
reason for the Yale-Chicago game
j on October 17 was to do honor to a
i Yale boy who had more than made
! good in Chicago. As a pitcher at
! Yale, Stagg never lost a game, and
! when he took up his duties at Chi
| cago, as a member of the faculty,
I mind you, he coached, captained,
| and played on the football team!
! You'd think that the Stagg, on the
! eve of so long and so successful a
| career, would have drunk his fill of
I coaching, and be more or less sick
' of seeing footballs, football players,
| and football games. But no, the Old
j Man stated recently that last year,
! in which his team lost every Con
j ference game, was one of his most
j successful, because the interest of
j his "boys" increased week after
i week. Spirit means more to Stagg
I than victories. Now if the Alumni
I would only look at it that way too!


Season Without Any Conference Victories Was "Most
Successful," Stagg Avows; Spirit Stressed

I This is "The Old Man's" fortieth j
; season, and he celebrated his 69'h j
j birthday about a month ago by j
: playing some tennis with his son.
One offspring, by the way, Paul I
Stagg, is quarterback of this year's '

| University of Chicago 'team. One
reason for the Yale-Chicago game
j on October 17 was to do honor to a
i Yale boy who had more than made
! good in Chicago. As a pitcher at
! Yale, Stagg never lost a game, and
! when he took up his duties at Chi
| cago, as a member of the faculty,
I mind you, he coached, captained,
| and played on the football team!
! You'd think that the Stagg, on the
! eve of so long and so successful a
| career, would have drunk his fill of
I coaching, and be more or less sick
' of seeing footballs, football players,
| and football games. But no, the Old
j Man stated recently that last year,
! in which his team lost every Con
j ference game, was one of his most
j successful, because the interest of
j his "boys" increased week after
i week. Spirit means more to Stagg
I than victories. Now if the Alumni
I would only look at it that way too!
