An urgent call for more candi
dates for the freshman fcncing
squad was issued yesterday by Fred
Pearman, varsity letter man, who is
working with the yearlings.
"So far only six freshmen have
turned out," Pearman said, "and
we need more material with which
to build a team to meet California
winter quarter."
| Minor sport class numerals will
be awarded first-year men who en
ter the California meet, and squad
members may use their fencing to
fulfill lower division gym require
ments. Pearman stressed especially
the fact that no experience is re
quired.
Stanford freshmen have never lost
a fencing meet to California.
