# SOCCER REGULARS UNABLE TO HOLD SUBS IN PRACTICE
## Beggs, Moore, Mearns On Bench; Maloney Lays Stress On Passing 
### Francis Lloyd 
With Beggs, Moore, and Mearns
taking a breather on the sidelines
after Saturday's hard struggle, the
second-string backs are standing off
the work of the varsity forward
wall.
The passing and goal shooting ef ]
the center trio of the Redshirt outfit
must be improved before ihe season
progresses much further. Harry Ma
loney has been continually stressing
the necessity of an accurate short
game.
Varsity Line Weak
Minus the services of three regu
lars, the redshirted first team was
unable to score on the whiteshirts.
The Reds' forward wall was con
tinually being broken up by the
hard playing of Larry Washburn,
center halfback for the Whites.
The Reds' fullbacks, Buster
Holmes and "Dutch" Brekelbaum,
I again were putting on the kind of a
show the customers pay to see. Ap
l parently these two "power" men
i can't be tired out, even though they
j manage to take the brunt of every
game.
Two Frosh Teams
j Almost two complete teams have
i reported to George Eberhart for the
| yearling squad, which must be
j rounded into much better shape if
j Stanford wants to take the fresh -
1 man series from California.
Although comparative scores are
very deceptive, it is rather a gloomy
thing to note that the' Mission High
outfit, which took the Farm first -
year men with comparative ease,
were held to a 1-1 stand-off by the
California Cubs. '
On Friday the Babes are sched
j uled to meet an outfit from Pesca
j dero High which is rated an even
j stronger team than the Mission High
I crew. With the exception of one or
I two players the Indian yearling
; line-up is as yet undecided, and
I this week's practice will undoubtcd
|ly decide several of the doubtful
' positions.
