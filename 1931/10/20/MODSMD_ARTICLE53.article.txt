# TROT SENDS "BEST EVER" ELEVEN TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## Trojan Pass Defense Weak; Bears Need Strength In Forward Line 
### 
Gathering momentum as the sea
son reaches its zenith, the "best
ever" Southern California eleven
conies to Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley next Saturday for the first
time since 1928. Thirty to nothing,
38-G, and 53-0 the scoreboard has
read since St. Mary's hung it on
the Trojan chin a month ago.
Three years ago Don Williams led
the Cardinal and Gold to Straw
berry Canyon and spent the greater
part of the afternoon sliding on his
ear in a chopped-up, watered turf.
The Trojan cutback was next to
useless that afternoon, most of the
S.C. ground-gaining in that 0-0 tie
being, done by a young blond sopho
more named Marshall Duffield.
California didn't gain.
The Blue and Gold is coming up
fast now, but it can hardly hope to
beat U.S.C. with a virtually untried
line. True, St. Mary's did turn hack
the Trojans with three sophomores
in their forward line, but at least
their center trio and Captain Toby
Hunt at tackle were veterans. Ran
some, Tozer, Carlson, Dißesta, Mc-
Arthur—willfng but green.
Howard Jones has a great scoring
machine headed by Orv Mohler,
Ernie Pinclcert, Gus Shaver, and Jim
Musick. He has a massive line,
sti'ong and experienced, but for
Rosenberg at one tackle. He has
the memory of that 74-0 licking
handed to these same Bears last
year.
California MAY conceivably beat
the Trojans—anything can happen
in football. If that sophomore line
can withstand the Jonesmen's
power, if California can take ad
vantage of Troy's weakness against
passes, if California's backs can im
prove enough to stop the Trojans'
passes—oh, well. Four touchdowns'
to none looks like the score today,,
