# NATIONAL SURVEY SHOWS COLLEGES FEEL DEPRESSION
## Students Forced To Spend Time On Jobs Rather Than Luxuries

NEW YORK, Oct. 19. (A 3 )— Tho
usands of last year's col lege boys ate
home oil the farm this fall or help
ing the _pater with business.
Thousands of last year's deter
mined - to - quit - and - go - to -
work youths are back in the class
rooms.
They balance — and statistically
higher education picks up about
where it left ofT.
Statistics from 144 universities and
colleges of all descriptions and in
all parts of the country show fall
enrollment of 394,481 students, as
compared to 394,075 at the same
time last year. The increase of 406
amounts to slightly more than one
tenth of 1 per cent.
Some colleges gained, others lost,
and in both cases the deans or
registrars attributed the change to
business conditions.
Nearly every institution gained
local students who in other years
would have gone away to school.
Reports came from several uni
versities that hundreds of students
who made application to enter failed
to gain the money for tuition before
time for registration.
Fine arts departments—perhaps
considered luxury — suffered the
greatest decreases and vocational
departments picked up the cultural
losses.
