# CAMPUS HOOVER CLUB ORGANIZED
## Campaign For Re-Election Sweeps Country 
### 
Stanford students will have an
opportunity to register their politi
cal sentiments in the form of a
Hoover Thirty-two Club, it was an
nounced yesterday. The campus unit
will be a part of a nation-wide or
ganization which has for its purpose
the enrollment of all those who are
looking for an opportunity to boost
the Hoover-in-1932 movement.

There are now hundreds of groups
in California, with 8,000 members
in Los Angeles county alone. Each
unit is limited to 32 members, addi
tional supporters forming units as
they are needed. One dollar each is
collected from members and for
warded in full to the Republican
National Committee as a campaign
contribution, thus enabling the in
dividual to actively support the
movement in a small way.

Originating here in California, the
Hoover-in-32 movement proved so
popular that it soon spread across
the country, with headquarters at
present established in Wcsttown,
Pennsylvania. It is hoped that the
cause will receive a new impetus
when initiated into the President's
home town and alma mater.

All those interested will find de
tails posted on the political science
department bulletin boards or may
get in touch with Joseph R. Nutt,
Jr., or A. Wayne Elwood at 132 Lin
coln Ave., Palo Alto, or phone P.A.
8563.
