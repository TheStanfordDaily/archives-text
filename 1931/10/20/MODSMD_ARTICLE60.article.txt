# FACULTY MEMBER TRAVELS IN FAMED GERMAN ZEPPELIN
## 
### 
Relating a thrill afforded to few
travelers in. Europe, Henry Maier,
director of the Stanford Experi
mental Farm, returned to the cam
pus late last week after a four
months' trip to Europe, telling of a
voyage in the famed Graf Zeppelin.
Combining business and pleasure,
Maier journeyed to England, Italy,
and Germany where he examined
netted gardens of the world, among
them being those of the Bucking
ham Palace grounds and in the
Vatican. The gardens of Europe can
not be compared with those of this
country, Maier stated, as local
planting is relatively young.
The Stanford man collected seeds
from each of the countries he visited
to experiment with in planting on
the campus. When in Germany
Maier visited Heidelberg, his Alma
Mater, for the first time in 45 years.
