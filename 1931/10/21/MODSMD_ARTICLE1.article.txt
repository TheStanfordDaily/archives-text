S.S. ILE DE FRANCE, Oct. 20 (/P.)
â€”Premier Pierre Laval of France,
on his way to Washington to talk
with President Hoover, made it
clear today that he is willing to
meet the President half way on any
proposals he may make, so long as
they are acceptable to the French
Parliament.
And, if he can get a promise of
American co-operation which would
justify from the French standpoint
cutting down the outlay on arma
ments, his latitude in the negotia
tions at Washington will be in
creased.
General Pact Seen
In this connection, it is under
stood, he is ready to propose an
agreement that in case of war in
volving either country, neither
country would permit its resources
to be used against the other.
A "consultative pact" has been
suggested as a description for such
an agreement but the French idea
is that it would be of a very defi
nite character and possibly would
include other powers as signa
tories.
Then, in case France, the United
States, or any other signatory
should be attacked, no neutral
power included in the agreement
would aid the aggressor by furnish
ing him munitions or other sup
plies. The Hague Court would de
cide which was the aggressor.
