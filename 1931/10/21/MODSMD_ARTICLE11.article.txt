## Parade To Trainâ€”Hillman And Warner To Speak; Stunts Arranged 
### 
'"A blood 'n' thunder send-ofT for
an appetizer, and Husky meat for
dinner Saturday night."
In this spirit the Rally Committee
last night laid plans for an all-Uni
versity parade and celebration to bid
Pop Warner and his gridmen a
roaring goodbye as they entrain for
Seattle at 3:20 o'clock tomorrow af
ternoon.
The parade, led by Yell King
Larry Harris and his cohorts, will
start at the Phi Gamma Delta house,
Lasuen and Dolores, at 2:50 sharp.
With the clanging of many bells and
the whining of sirens it will travel
down the Row, to be joined by fra
ternity and sorority delegations.
Route Past Halls
At the engineering corner the
caravan will swing east past Bran
ner, Toyon, and Encina, and then
back in front of the Quad to en
circle Sequoia. Here the voice of
Sequoia's big bell will be added to
the din, and the whole procession
will then go directly to the S.P.
depot.
While team members hunt emptv
red plush seats, Pop Warner will
stand on a baggage truck and tell
the fans what he thinks the Red
Machine will do to the Malemutes.
Then Captain Harry Hillman will
talk, after which the assembled mul
titude will be put through a short
cheering workout.
Ed Boyles, chairman of the Rally
Committee, asked that all members
of the committee be on deck at the
starting point of the parade at 2:30.
Card Stunts Set
Bernarr Bates, in charge of Ihe
rooting section card stunts at the
U.S.C. game, announced the plan
of action and described the stunts
which will be used.
The opening display will be '.he
"give 'em the axe" idea, with the
second stunt complimenting S.C. and
Los Angeles on the 1932 Olympics.
r inc next trick will be to changc the
dashing Trojan war horse into a
dejected-looking mule, after which
a beautiful S.C. monogram embossed
on a blanket will suddenly become a
label on a coffin. The final effort
will be the traditional block S.
Boyles asked the committee to
consider the possibility of a bleacher
rally at the practice field during the
week before the Trojan game. This
matter would be decided at the next
meeting, he said.
Committee Named
Marian Hewlett and Bernarr Bates
were appointed to the reception
committee, to serve the remainder
of the year.
