# MURAL DIVOT MEN MUST QUALIFY FOR TOURNEY, MARSHALL
## 
### 
Intramural golf teams will be re
: quired to play a qualifying round
i before competition commences, sta
; ted Joe Marshall, senior manager,
j yesterday. This contradiction to yes
: terday's erroneous statement in the
I Daily is the result of further con
| sideration by those in charge of the
I toui'anment.
The new ruling is as follows. A
J medal round will be finished by
Saturday night, all teams reporting
! their combined scores not later than
i this time. Eighteen holes will be
I required, and the score turned in is
j to be the sum of the cards of both
i men composing the team.
First round play is to be com
pleted by Wednesday night, second
; round by Friday, and third round
| by Monday. This brings the tourna-
J ment to the finals, which will be
staged Tuesday, two weeks from
{ yesterday.
