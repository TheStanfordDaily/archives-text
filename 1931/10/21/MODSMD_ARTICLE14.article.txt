# AMERICA SEEKS EASTERN PEACE
## Peace Pledges Invoked In Sino-Japanese Struggle 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. (JP) —
America today called upon Japan
and China to remember their sol
emn pledges against war.
For the second time in history,
the Washington Government in
voked the Kellogg-Briand pact of
Paris by which more than fifty na
tions promised to settle their dis
putes by pacific means.
Stimson Dodges Action
This time the United States was
content to let other nations take
the lead. Its action in invoking the
past was in compliance with a re
quest received from five European
countries which on Saturday at
Geneva agreed to mobilize world
public opinion to prevent war in
Manchuria.
Diplomatic considerations led Sec
retary Stimson to refrain from act
ing at the same time as the five
leaders—Great Britain, France, Italy,
Spain, and Germany.
In view of apparent indications of
Japanese misunderstanding of the
American interest in the situation,
Secretary Stimson preferred to step
into the background, although his
efforts for peace were in no way
diminished.
Notes lidcntical
Making no attempt to pass on the
merits of the complicated Man
churian controversy, the United
States in the most earnest language
appealed for a settlement of the
dispute without the use of force.
