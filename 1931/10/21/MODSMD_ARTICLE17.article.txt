# Stanford Owes Privacy To Mere Bits Of Rope
## 
### 
Stanford owes her privacy to —160
yards of rope.
Just 480 feet of twisted hempen
strands guard Stanford's vast acre
age against the onrush of the great
unwashed.
Except for the vigilance of Comp- (
troller Almon E. Roth, and Fred
Frehe, superintendent, Stanford's
campus would, through an old j
Spanish custom, pass over to become I
the public property of Palo Alto.
But every once in a while, after
a summer or two, the citizenry of
Palo Alto awake to find the roads
into the campus tied conspicuously
by light ropes, knotted decorativoly j
with bits of red flannel.
A crew of 16 laborers is kept busy |
manning the ropes. When a cam- j
pus-bound car approaches, the as- |
tonished motorist must come to a
complete stop before the gate- !
keeper methodically unties the

leash, lets the car pass, and again >
secures a four-in-hand to preserve j
the privacy of Stanford.
This formula, an event, of the past \
summer, has been repeated since j
the beginning of Stanford as a cam- j
pus. An old common law, with its j
roots in native custom, has held that i
wheresoever the public is allowed i
to pass for a period of years, that
land becomes public property.
Though famed for its far-reaching I
lands, Stanford has never had gates
to swing shut as a gesture of self
possession. The acreage is entirely j
fcnced, but the public runs at will
over its byways until the day comes j
when a web is sprung across the
entrances.
Four public highways cut through
the campus—the Portola road, Page '
Mill, Sandhill road, and Mayfield
avenue. For the rest, Stanford's en
tity hangs by a crimson-flannelled
thread.
