# FARM DOCTORS TAKE MEASURE OF POLIO VIRUS
## Schultz, Clifton, Gebhardt, Announce Results Of Experiments 
### 
Marking another step toward the
conquest of infantile paralysis, three
Stanford bacteriologists have been
able to measure the invisible virus
of the disease.
Doctors Edwin Schultz, Charles
Clifton, and Louis Gebhardt an
nounce that the poliomyelitis virus
is so infinitesimal that it would take
a huddle of five to be visible through
the most powerful microscope. Its
size, says Dr. Schultz, is less than
50 millimicrons, or 500-thousandths
of an inch.
The Stanford bacteriologist has
more faith in the general preven
tion of infantile paralysis than its
ultimate cure. Experiments, he
points out, have shown that be
tween two-thirds and three-fourths
of the adult population are immune,
possibly because of some unrecog
nized "subclinical" infection with
the disease.
He believes that the real solution
"lies in the detection of susceptible
persons by some inexpensive test,
and then the active immunization
of all susceptibles, especially chil
dren, by some method to be worked
out."
The three collaborators are, how
ever, devoting much energy to a
perfection of serum to be given to
those stricken with the disease.
Monkeys and horses have been
found to yield antiseria of promis
ing quality.
Dr. Schultz, a professor at Stan
ford for the past eleven years, has
made important contributions to the
knowledge of ultra-scopic virus. At
present the poliomyelitis germ is re
ceiving most of his attention.
