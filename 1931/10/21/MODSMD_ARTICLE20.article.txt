Details of a new system of indi- !
vidual photography for the 1932
l Quad, to be handled by the Watson
Studios of Berkeley, were outlined j
: last night by Editor Tom Aitken at :
j a meeting of the editorial staff of 1
the '32 yearbook.
Similar to the system used by the I
studio at California for the Blue and j
1 Gold, U.C. annual, the Berkeley firm i
| will modify it only to suit the needs
| of this campus, said Aitken. As the >
firm will be on the campus for a
limited time, a system will be j
j worked out whereby a certain group
I of seniors will be photographed on <
certain days and on those days only.
Aitken announced that nine living j
groups have not yet handed in
rosters of their members, including
! Gamma Phi Beta, Pi Beta Phi, Phi
! Gamma Delta, Phi Sigma Kappa,
I Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Theta Xi, 1
Zeta Psi, and El Capitan. These |
; rosters should be in today, he said. I
