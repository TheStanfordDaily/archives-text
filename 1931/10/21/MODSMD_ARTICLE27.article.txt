# VARSITY GIVEN STIFF DRILL IN FUNDAMENTALS
## Blocking And Pass Plays Emphasized In Hard Scrimmage Tilt GRAYS EXHIBIT CLASS Probable Wet Turf Offers Test In "Mudding" 
### Mark Scholtz 
There was no tea served at yester
day's grid session on the Stanford
football field. In fact there weren't
even any lemons except the numer
ous scribes who got in the way of
the players. A diet of straight, hard
scrimmage was prescribed for the
squad by Coach Warner, and it was
administered in plentiful doses.
The first part of the afternoon
was devoted to fundamentals, espe
cially the fine art of effective block
ing. Realizing the importance of
this phase of the game, Pop never
fails to include a short but strenu
ous session of concentration on tak
ing a man out of the play during
the course of an afternoon. In the
meantime the backs and ends were
running through a few pass plays.
Grays Make Gains
Then the Grays trotted on the
field and gave the varsity an oppor
tunity to show their defensive abil
ity in stopping some well chosen
plays under the direction of Coach
Cuddeback. The results were fairly
gratifying, although the ineligibles
showed a lot of class in running
through their repertoire. Several
times the Gray backs broke through
for long gains, sounding a warning
to those who have eyes on the reg
ular jobs for next year.
Reports from Seattle indicate a
wet reception for the Indians when
they go north for Saturday's battle
with Washington's Huskies. It has
been raining up there for the Ja.st
two days, and the sky is still black.
It will be the first experience for
Pop Warner's boys in "mudding"
during the IIJ3Il l J31 season, and it will
be interesting to note how it affects
their football. One thing is a cinch;
the Huskies don't feel natural un
less the field is inundated with at
least six inches of water, so it will
not hurt their chances.
Injured List Long
The list of injured is long but not
a cause for a great deal of worry.
Phil Neill was back in a suit and
evidently ready for action again.
Mofiatt was in a suit but did not
scrimmage, still favoring his strained
back from the Oregon Stale tussle.
Ray Hulen hurt his shoulder in the
early part of the afternoon and was
told to lay off for the day. Ernie
Caddell was also present but inac
tive due to an injury received in
tackling practice Monday. Gray and
Gribbin are both rarin' to go, but
trainer Denny thinks they ought to
wait another day or so before re
suming hostilities. If no one else
gets hurt within the next week or
so, the squad should be in fine shape
for the S.C. game on November 7.
The squad leaves Thursday for
Seattle and will probably include
three full teams. This will be the
first time this season that the eleven
will play away from home. Warner
is expecting a stiff battle, for Jimmy
Phelan doesn't like to lose two foot
ball games in a row if he can help it.
However, on paper the Indians look
like the stronger of the two squads.
