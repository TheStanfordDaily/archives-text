# WHAT'S IN A NAME?
## 
### 
Chunky, blond Marshall Dutlield, versatile Trojan grid
iron star of last season, according to a press dispatch, has
withdrawn his hat from the mayoralty ring of Santa Mon
ica because he found "small-town politics not to my lik
ing."' Dutlield intends to act as secretary to George Clark,
candidate for the United States Senate.
Duffield's meteoric entrance into politics aptly shows
the value of college athletic prominence in getting a good
start after leaving the university. Business men realize the
worth of a name that has been in the limelight and pref
erence is often given to a man who has occupied the sports
headlines during his college career.
Intelligence is not so important to the athletic hero in
gaining this start, his need for brains coming a little later
when his erstwhile admiring public has begun to forget
his broken field running and the accuracy of his passes.
Then he will be forced to prove that he can do something
else with bis head than wear a football helmet.
However, a varsity monogram is a greater asset than a
Phi Bete key in landing a desirable position and, whether
the position can be held or not, more opportunities line the
paths of the heroes of sportsdom than occur to their studi
ous brethren. And in this country, flooded with college
graduates, opportunities are of utmost importance.
In spite of Marshall Duflield's Phi Bete key, he would
probably be selling stocks and bonds were he built more
like Mahatma Gandhi.
