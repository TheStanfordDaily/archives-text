# "MEAN DISPOSITIONED PROFS"
## 
### 
The Kansas Stair Collegian, representing student opin
ion ;it the Middle Western institution, carries an editorial
(his week lamenting the fact that a number of the lecturers
in the class rooms are not as prompt in responding to the
warning hell at the end of the. hour as they should he.
The paper even goes so far as to solicit the names of
the offending professors to he printed in a column under
the heading, "The Blacklist." It is pointed out that these
faculty members do not detain the students because of a
pretended interest in the subject, but "because of a natural
meanness of disposition."
The Daily admires Ihe spirit of the Kansas paper ami
wishes good luck in the campaign. A definite program and
schedule is arranged by the students and overtime in one
class is bound to cause tardiness in the ensuing one.
