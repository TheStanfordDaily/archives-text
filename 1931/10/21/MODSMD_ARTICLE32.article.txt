# A 						FOUR-YEAR EDUCATION

### 
The report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching indicated that the college fresh
man has knowledge equivalent to or above that of the
senior. This opinion is founded on examinations taken by
1(1,000 college students in Pennsylvania schools.
Reason for the failure of the American colleges to give
their students an education is advanced by the compilers
of the survey. The criticism is directed against the semes
ter instruction: "The semester-system, that is, electing of a
specific course for one term, to be examined upon, and
then to be forgotten, has failed in the education of students
because the ideas taught in that way are not easily made
applicable to outside life."
"The tragedy with this lies in the fact that the raw ma
terial dosed out to college students, with proper treatment
might have produced a body of intellectually capable and
alert men. Rut because of the system of instilling this
knowledge into the student, the foundation has been forced
to conclude that the effective knowledge of the college
graduate amounts to little more than what he had in his
freshman year."
It is doubtful whether this conclusion reached regard
ing the relative knowledge of college freshmen and seniors
is valid. In spite of its statistical backing, the report exag
gerates the loss from forgetting. It must be admitted that
the average college senior has acquired a generalized con
ception of the universal principles underlying his studies
although he has forgotten the factual details. Three years
of university life should widen the views and increase the
vocabulary of almost any student.
The foundation's report on the material things of an
education need cause no depression among students, how
ever, for certain cultural benefits are bound to be absorbed
even by the most heedless. Our education is not to be
measured merely by a storage of facts; it is dependent
equally on the disposal of our leisure, on our absorbing
culture. The world is ahead of our textbook facts; the
universal principles we apply and not our amassing of
facts places us with the odds in our favor when we com
pete with the high school graduate.
Compulsory courses create many problems in educa
itonal institutions. Freedom to choose his course means
much to the student, for it is generally acknowledged that
some courses which have no interest for him are almost
valueless. Absolute and unregulated freedom might also
result in evils. It is the work of the educator to ascertain
the proper balance and to continue to adjust that balance
to changing conditions- (Reprinted from the Daily Illini)
