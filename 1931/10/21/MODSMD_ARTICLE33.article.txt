# BULL SESSION
## THE 						DAILY WAVES THE STANFIRD RED 
### 
In a brief editorial, sandwiched j
in between comment on U.S.C. and !
on colds, the Daily yesterday pro
claimed that "it is fitting that every i
son i and daughter of the Stanford j
Red should vote for Hoover." Of
course, the whole editorial was
probably a last-minute affair to fill
up the column and is not the result
of long cogitation—at least that is
the most sympathetic view to take.
While the Bull Session does not
mean to infer that all sons and
daughters of the Stanford Red
should not vote for Hoover, it is
firmly maintained that they should !
not vote for Hoover BECAUSE they
belong to this University. The same
lack of logic that makes people vote
for candidates because they hail
from a certain town, or a certain
part of the state, will cause students
to vote for Hoover because way
back in '91 a dark-haired frosh may
have carved "H.C.H." in Encina.
Of course the President would
like support from his Alma Mater,
but he could not receive it on ihe
basis that the Daily advocated.
Hoover stands for the scientific
method in government — get the
facts, weigh them carefully, and
then decide without any reference !
to feeling or emotion. That is what j
the student body should do. If at j
the end of this process, Hoover wins !
—good; but if the facts speak against j
him, the student as a thinking indi
vidual, should feel no hesitancy in
casting his ballot the other way.
A "Hoover In '32" club has been
established on this campus. This
writer feels that the Democratic
students should immediately follow
suit and form a "Roosevelt In '32 &
'36 Club"; or perhaps, a "Roosevelt

In '32 Club" would be sufficient.
While the Bull Session would not
join either organization; but would
rather remain on the outside looking
and listening in on both bodies, it is
evident that the formation of a
Democratic club would show a virile
and fearless and unshackled student
opinion—which is necessary and ex
pected in an institution that seeks
to build leaders —and more espe
cially in a University with our
motto —'"The Winds of Freedom Are
Blowing."
Wilh the rank and file, politics is
just like a football game—cheer with
the home team; and just as Betty
Co-ed supports the team with the
prettiest colors or the cutest uni
forms, so many of our citizens vote
for a president on absolutely imma
terial grounds. The Democrats used
Smith's Brown Derby to advantage
in some regions; and the Republi
cans used his hat to his disadvan
tage in other regions. But whether
Smith wore a brown derby, a black
derby, or went bareheaded did not
alter the issues involved.
In the coming campaign—and the
campaign is already upon us—let
Stanford students -act without the
narrow provincialism that brands
the South Carolina Democrat wh i
would vote for a "jack-ass" if he
bore the party label in preference
to the best Republican on earth.
To vote against Hoover is not
treason to the Stanford red; it might
indicate the highest loyalty to the
ideals of this University. To vote
for Hoover because he hails from
Stanford is no glorious act. To vote
for Hoover on scientific grounds in
dicates true intelligence.
