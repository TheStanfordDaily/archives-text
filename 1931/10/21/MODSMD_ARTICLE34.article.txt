TWO HEARTS IN WALTZ TIME—

This book can be recommended
I only with the most complicated
j reservations. Some readers will find
it morbid, unhealthy, and rather
! meaningless. Others will find it full
| of beauty and significance.
It is not a usual book. The
main character is haunted through
out his life by a strange presence,
which assumes different forms—at
times a mere shadow, or a whisper,
often an actual person—and which
the hero mistakes at the outset for
his good angel. Events protfe, how
ever, that this phantom which pur
sues him from episode to episode
counsels the hero only to a malig
nant and destructive end, and ulti
mately effects his complete ruin.
The book is reminiscent in tone of
certain of Poe's short stories. In a
long piece of work this element of
the supernatural and the allegorical
is difficult to handle. The author
evidently was not wholly successful (
in the technique of this particular
aspect, for in chapters the story
seems blurred and vague, and the
reader loses the allegory when he
follows the story, and then finds

] the allegory but the story does not
seer.i to fit. The main threads fraz
zle out. Also, the conclusion of the
story has a depressing futility, and
makes the book in retrospect appear
trivial. —M.L.R.

This book can be recommended
I only with the most complicated
j reservations. Some readers will find
it morbid, unhealthy, and rather
! meaningless. Others will find it full
| of beauty and significance.
It is not a usual book. The
main character is haunted through
out his life by a strange presence,
which assumes different forms—at
times a mere shadow, or a whisper,
often an actual person—and which
the hero mistakes at the outset for
his good angel. Events protfe, how
ever, that this phantom which pur
sues him from episode to episode
counsels the hero only to a malig
nant and destructive end, and ulti
mately effects his complete ruin.
The book is reminiscent in tone of
certain of Poe's short stories. In a
long piece of work this element of
the supernatural and the allegorical
is difficult to handle. The author
evidently was not wholly successful (
in the technique of this particular
aspect, for in chapters the story
seems blurred and vague, and the
reader loses the allegory when he
follows the story, and then finds

] the allegory but the story does not
seer.i to fit. The main threads fraz
zle out. Also, the conclusion of the
story has a depressing futility, and
makes the book in retrospect appear
trivial. —M.L.R.

This book can be recommended
I only with the most complicated
j reservations. Some readers will find
it morbid, unhealthy, and rather
! meaningless. Others will find it full
| of beauty and significance.
It is not a usual book. The
main character is haunted through
out his life by a strange presence,
which assumes different forms—at
times a mere shadow, or a whisper,
often an actual person—and which
the hero mistakes at the outset for
his good angel. Events protfe, how
ever, that this phantom which pur
sues him from episode to episode
counsels the hero only to a malig
nant and destructive end, and ulti
mately effects his complete ruin.
The book is reminiscent in tone of
certain of Poe's short stories. In a
long piece of work this element of
the supernatural and the allegorical
is difficult to handle. The author
evidently was not wholly successful (
in the technique of this particular
aspect, for in chapters the story
seems blurred and vague, and the
reader loses the allegory when he
follows the story, and then finds

] the allegory but the story does not
seer.i to fit. The main threads fraz
zle out. Also, the conclusion of the
story has a depressing futility, and
makes the book in retrospect appear
trivial. —M.L.R.

John Henry was a negro. He reck
■ oned he might preach some but he
1 would be no preacher; he might roll
cotton some but he would be no
j cotton roller; he might do some
; thing with magic but he would be
i no conjure man. He explained:
" 'Cause my name is John Henry,
j and when fo'ks call me by my name
1 dey'll know I'm a natchal man.''
This is what John Henry told his
: mother back in the Black River
| country where he was born. He also
said: "My home ain't hyar, and I'm
I fixin' to git around."
John Henry then started out oh
; his travels. Wherever he went his
i ability was remarked, whether it
! was in rolling cotton, in passing up
i alluring sirens, or in taming hogs.
\ He drank, but only when he chose.
| John Henry was his own master,
jHe arrived in New Orleans and
• bought himself some new clothes,
j Now more than ever, as he very
I well knew, he was an object of
| feminine admiration. "So John
I Henry looked at Ruby and he looked
jat Delia. Then he looked up and
; down the street, and when he looked
! up and down the street he saw a
i woman named Julie Anne." Tins
! dusky Don Juan had met his fate,
J as Julie Anne knew and promptly
t told him. —E.T.P.
