## IN RE JOLLY-UPS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Referring to the matter of Jolly
ups, I think the one held on Wed
nesday last was one of the worst
I have ever attended. When I use
the term "worst," I mean worst from
the standpoint of a crowded en
vironment. # When Daniel Boone said,
"Give me elbow room and fresh
air," he was unconsciously voicing
the thoughts of many a Stanford
Brave.
If anyone wishes a good jam-up
plus a stuffy atmosphere he can pay
for it and enjoy it at a San Fran
cisco hotel. If the Jolly-ups are
going to continue as they now are,
the girls of Roble Hall should get
together and establish a supper
club. If the supper club does noth
ing better than raise money for
charity it will at least be aiding a
worthy cause. In addition, the at
mosphere created will be similar to
that of a first-class hotel and then
one will not mind getting stepped
on, pushed, scratched, kicked,
scrambled, baked (temperature 90
degrees), and refused.
Or of course, there is the other
alternative, why not hold the Jolly
up in a larger hall such as Roble
Gym. Anyway, get together and
puzzle the thing out.
