# BEARING THE BURDEN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We're humorously classed as "off
' campus subscribers." For years and
years we've followed the struggle
to get the alarm clock turned off
with a joyous trip to the front lawn
in bath robe and slippers to get our
"subscribed-for" copy of the Dippy.
But it isn't the Dippy any more—
aged and dignified—our four pages
of advertising and news and adver
tising has become The Stanford
Daily. And struggling under the load
of increased cost in priting, tot
tering under the weight of a new
found payroll—our paper doesn't
come to us any more. Why should
it? It's a better paper isn't it? We'll
get a copy SOME way, won't we?
We'll rush out to the campus
twenty minutes earlier and get a
copy from that pile that someone
is willing to swear was right at the
engineering corner for a few min
utes —just before we got there. Or
we may find the pile they've hidden
in the library this morning. Or we
may wait in line at the post office
for our copy. There's no use in going
1 to an eight o'clock without a copy
of the paper, anyway. Traditions are
taboo at Stanford—why tx - y to start
a new one in this modern age?
Someone has just discovered that
college papers don't circulate. In
another twenty-five years someone
else will discover that those same
college papers are supported by
voluntary subscription.
In the meantime our paper is tied
up in a fifteen-year contract to be
printed at prices that fail to win
the business of other campus or
ganizations, and The Stanford Daily
j will become better and better
through the mercenary efforts of
an increasingly efficient office force.
—And the simplest way to support
1 this radical change of policy (as any
good newspaper man will tell us) is
to place the whole burden on the
shoulders of the ten per cent who
are "off-campus subscribers," —pro-
vided, of course, that this small
group can be forced to continue as
such. —Ray E. Clark.
' How To Be Happy Though Hu
man" is the title of a new, forth
coming book.
Mexico will tax foreign cigarettes
j twice those made at home.
