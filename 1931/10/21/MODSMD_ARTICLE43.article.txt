# Babes Perfect Defense In Tough Session With Grays
## BRADSHAW TESTS SQUAD IN TROJAN METHOD OF PLAY Yearlings Prove Weakest In Pass Defense; Van Kirk In Line 
### Francis Hamilton 
Strenuous defensive pi'actice was
ordered for the Indian yearling foot
ball squad yesterday afternoon. The
babes labored until well alter dark
against the Grays, who have been
drilled in the U.S.C. system this
year.
At no time was the complete first
string freshman outfit in the fray
and it was impossible to gain an
idea of the defensive powers which
they might exhibit as n unit. The
various frosh combinations were
fairly effective against the running
attack, although in some instances
Iho Gray backs broke through for
long clean gains.
Aerial Defense Weak
On pass defense the yearlings
were far from impressive. The per
centage of U.S.C. aerial plays that
went true to the mark was too high.
A pleasant sight to Coach Brad
shaw's eyes was the appearance of
his first-string center, Van Kirk, in
a uniform after a two weeks' ab
sence from the turf. Van Kirk is
expected to play Saturday. Bowles
is romping around the field in his
usual brilliant style, looking chip
per after his lengthy stay on the
sidelines.
Three Injured
Lawry Rothert, who divides the
left halfback's duties with Bowles,
is not in the best of shape, ranking
in this respect with Semmelroth
Both are working out, but there re
mains a bare possibility that neither
will play against the Trobabes.
At present Durkee is handicapped
with one hand in a plaster cast, and
a leather guard to protest his nose,
but he is in there working with the
rest of them. If this blond lad gets
in the running next Saturday,
Quarterback Warburton and his
mates in the S.C. backfield will
have to get up on their toes. His
long passes are plenty potent, and
he may painfully remind the Tro
babes of a certain "Shufflin" Schef
lin's" tactics against their big broth
ers some weeks back.
Fed by more than 80.000,000 cubic
feet of gas a day, the Deep Rock Oil
Company's well is spouting fire '200
feet into the air a mile south of
Wewoka, Oklahoma.
