# ABLE CAIN
## â€™Bama Boosters Dote on Versatility of Their Famous Running, Passing, Kicking, Fighting Flash 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Cain is the name, John Cain, of
Alabama, suh. A versatile chap on a
football field is this 184-pound full
back, for he ptints, passes, carries
the ball, blocks, and calls signals.
Not bad. eh? His teammates call him
"Hurry," but the co-eds call him
"Sugar," and he's popular with
everyone.
Last year Alabama went through
the season undefeated, beating such
teams as Tennessee (18 to 6), Van
derbilt (12 to 7), Kentucky (19 to
0), Florida (20 to 0), and Georgia
(13 to 0). The Crimson Tide was
then selected to represent the "East"
in the annual Tournament of Roses
game at Pasadena on New Year's
Day, and what 'Bama did to Wash
ington State was a pity.
The Cougars were Pacific Coast
Conference champions, having de
feated California, U.S.C., Oregon
i State, and Washington, among
others. Yet when Wallace Wade's
team got through with the lads from
! Pullman, there were no points for
Washington State, and 24 for Ala
bama!
"Hurry ' Cain, then a sophomore,
with "Flash" Suther and "Monk"
Campbell were three backs who had
much to do with undoing the Cou-

' gars. Cain's 55-yard punt in the sec
j ond period paved the way for
| 'Barna's first touchdown, and he ran
i the team and carried the ball with
j great success. Altogether it was
j quite an "Ala's" Holiday for all of
Dixie, and many thought that the
j Tide had an equal claim with Notre
| Dame on the mythical national
j championship.
I Keep your eye on the left-footed
! "Hurry" Cain, for I have an idea
! you'll hear a lot more about this
hombre before the season is over.
