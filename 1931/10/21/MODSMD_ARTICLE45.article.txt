The Washington Huskies have not
made an impressive showing this
year. They lost to Oregon 13 to 0
and Oregon was humbled by U.S.C.
53 to 0. But experience has taught
Pop Warner that regardless of the
early season record of -the Huskies
they are always a tough team to
beat on their home grounds.
Two years ago Washington
was also underrated as one of
the weakest squads in the con
ference, and Stanford went up
to Seattle a heavy favorite to
smother the Huskies. The In
dians were lucky to come home
with a Ci to 0 victory. Stanford
scored a touchdown in the first
three minutes of play and spent
the rest of the afternoon pre
venting the score from being
tied.
And now Tom Laird, sports editor
of the San Francisco News, writes
that the experts believe California
will defeat Stanford. "The Golden
Bears created plenty of excitement
by defeating Washington State Sat
urday at Portland," says Laird.
In the opinion of this writer Bill
Ingram's Bears will create plenty
of cxcitement next Saturday if they
hold the Trojans within three
touchdowns.

Pop Warner wisely sent his
charges through a stiff tackling
practice Monday afternoon. The
formula for stopping the hard
hitting U.S.C. backs is perfect
tackling.
Regardless of all the tricks in the
bag, a 100 per cent perfect passing
attack, and offensive and defensive
strategy, Stanford will not conquer
the Trojans unless they do just what
ihey failed to do last year—to tackle,
clip, and block the eleven men on
the U.S.C. squad so hard in the
first few plays of the game that they
will not know what upset them until
the game is over.
'i hat is exactly the way U.S.C.
frounced Stanford last year, and
exactly the way Notre Dame
turned around and humbled the
Trojans several weeks later.
We must admit though that the
Indians have defensively improved
this year but there is room for
plenty more.
We are not so worried about
the ability of the Indians to
score against Troy, for outside
of Notre Dame Stanford was the
only team able to score twice
against U.S.C. last year. Both
scores were made via aerial
route. —L.M.C.
