# MALONEY FEATURES OFFENSIVE ATTACK IN SOCCER PRACTICE
## 
### 
Intricate plays to be used on the
attack were the order of the day
j when Harry Maloney put his var
| sity soccer charges through a long
, workout yesterday afternoon.
To develop a powerful attack,
capable of scoring goals against the
| most stubborn defense is the job of
j the Stanford mentor at the present
i time. The Redshirts have from the
start of the season shown an air
] tight defense, but have been lacking
! in goal-piercing punch.
Using the outside forwards as de
coys, who only pass the ball back
to the half, who shoots the oval to
the center forward, Maloney per
fected this play as one which should
! be useful for the Indians in their
I future games.
All the regulars were back on the
j field today and showed the effects
j of their one day lay-off by playing
harder than ever in yesterday's
I scrimage. Larry Washburn was
| given a try at the center half post
and acquitted himself in good style.
