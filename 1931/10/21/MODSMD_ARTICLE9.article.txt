# DAVIS SPEAKS ON FARM BOARD
## Purpose, Accomplishments Of Board Explained 
### 
"The organization of the Federal
; Farm Board has called for much
! courage and endurance, and more
j wisdom, perhaps, than any man
i possesses," said Dr. Joseph S. Davis,
who spoke in the Assembly Hall
last night on "Sidelights on the
Farm Board." This was the second
! if the regular Tuesday evening lec- !
! ture series being arranged by the
Public Committee.
Dr. Davis b"»ve a brief resume of !
the founding of Lhe Farm Board
under the Federal Act,
and discussed the purpoj®, objec- ;
! tives, and accomplishments to date, j
Board Makes Progress
j "The Board is making real prog- '
j ress, but it is still difficult to make '
the farmers realize that produce
grown beyond the demands of the ;
consumer is superfluous," the
speaker continued,
"Immediately after the organiza
j tion of the Farm Board, several i
j major decisions were made. The j
, first was a vigorous policy of action,
; as contrasted with a policy of in
j vestigation and watchful waiting. 1
The second decision was to foster ;
' the development of larger scale co- j
| operatives rather than increasing
| the number of small ones."
The distinguished economist said ;
i that one of the major difficulties (
| was "to get the co-operatives to co- |
I operate." The purpose of these as- j
: sociations of organized farmers, he !
i said, is to control marketing and
l production. Such affiliations of |
j farmers are common in the wheat, i
j cotton, bean, and beet industries. j
Purposes Explained
Dr. Davis explained at length the '
j purpose of the Farmers' National '
; Grain Corporation, which is owned j
j by a large number of farmers' co- j
! operative associations, and which
| sells grain and distributes the profit i
| at the end of the year to its mem- |
j bers.
i The speaker, who has been the !
\ director of the Stanford Food Re- !
search Institute since 1921, was for j
a time Chief Economist of the Fed
eral Farm Board. He went to Wash- 1
ington in 1929 and organized and i
developed an economic staff for the |
Farm Board, and acted as economic :
counsel.
One of his principal works was to
develop channels of information for j
the board. Dr. Davis has had much I
experience in the field of economic
research, having taught at Harvard,
written several books, been con
tributing editor and writer for a
number of technical magazines, and i
acted as expert in international j
economic disputes.
