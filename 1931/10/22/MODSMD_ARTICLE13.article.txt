''Berkeley Square," in its rapid
change from the hectic modern
scramble into the "sedan-chair"

provide its audience with a fascinat
ing study of tempo and mood.

ant factor in the successful pre
sentation of any modern play, are
particularly essential in John Bal
derson's production.
The "sound effect" man must, ac
cording to Helvenston, employ
noises to create a sort of incidental
music which will heighten the dra
matic effect of the action on the
stage.
From the opening scene, which
takes place on a stormy night, one
of half-sensed mystery with the
sounds of thunder, wind, rain, car
riages, horses' hoofs, clocks, chimes,
and bells until the end many of the
incidental noises used to make the
perfect illusion.
One of the most difficult tasks
faced by the special crew is 1o
create in sound the illusion of 150
years lapse of time between scenes
of the play. A subtle differentiation
is necessary, for example, to show
the effect of the centuries on a
striking clock, new in 1778 and old
in 1928.
Thunder, win, and rain machines
are used in developing the interest
