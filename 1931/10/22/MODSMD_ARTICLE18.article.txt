An exceptionally varied program,

party, held last night in the Dance
Studio of the new women's gym.
A prize for the most humorous
costume at the party was awarded
to Sandy Lieb and one for the best
costume went to Esther Pickering.
fhe first numbers on the program
were the senior and junior skits.
These were followed by an interval
of several dances, the music for
which was provided by Herbert
Shapiro and his orchestra.
The speakers of the evening were
Kay Spaulding, president of the
Y.W.C.A., Jane Snyder, president of
W.A.A., and Dean Yost, who added
her part by reciting a very appro
priate poem.
The program was resumed again
with a tap dance number by Jane
Hewlett, ah especially interesting
Hawaiian dance by Beatrice Rogers,
and the sophomore skit, which con
sisted of harmony singing. The
freshman skit, always the high spot
of the conference parties, was given
by an all star cast of freshman
women.
