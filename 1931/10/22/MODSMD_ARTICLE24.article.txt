# Marlene, Mickey Clash Over Bouquet Of Rough
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Stanford roughdom has evidently ,
not. decided which it likes best—
Dietrich or Garbo; so there is a i
universal turnout for both. Mickey
Mouse outranks either of these as a .
prime favorite.
Four years of watching colds
troop past his box office have
brought several conclusions to
Harry Brown, manager of the Stan
ford Theatre.
Stanford students, he says, have (
an admirable sense of values—they j
know what is good in motion pic
tures —and what is bad. Highly dra
matic pictures, well done, are able ,
to draw the reward of student at- ;
tention—but no group is quicker to
leap upon inconsistencies than the
ready roughs of Stanford.
Tastes educated above the average
big-city audience, youthful recep
tiveness, and unabashed frankness
of reaction mark the collegian in his >
seat at the movies. J

, "The sophisticated play comes first
! with Stanford students," says Brown.
: il ßut comedies are vastly popular.
In all my years of theatre experi
i ence, I have never heard any people
; laugh as uproariously as Stanford
' men when they are enjoying a
show."
Thumbs down from Stanford on
impassioned romance, as Brown is
ready to testify. Although producers
; have speeded up the stage-kiss to a
( fraction of its original footage, noth
| ing else can arouse the rough to
cynicism so easily.
Travel and adventure have lost
i place with movje-goers. Costume
l pictures and those laid in far-away
locales arc barely able to break even
on cost of production. Westerns get
the most continuous personal sup
port froiji the seats.
! Brown takes special care to book
good pictures during finals, when
all of Stanford drops in to relax
I from its studies.
