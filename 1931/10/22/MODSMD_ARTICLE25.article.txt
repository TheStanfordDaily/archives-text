"The parade will take place dur
ing library conference hours,"
Boyles said, "and authorities have
asked that we refrain from unne

Bookstore and until we reach the
Encina road."

declared. "We are hoping to have
a turnout of more than 500. Although
the band will be unable to be in the
parade, it will be at the train to
take part in the celebration."
