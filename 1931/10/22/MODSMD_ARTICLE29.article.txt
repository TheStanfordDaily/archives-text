# Friends Pay Tribute to Thomas A. Edison at Simple Funeral
## Noted Inventor Buried After Service in Drawing Room of Mansion; Music, Poetry, and Flowers Add Impressiveness to Ceremony 
### 
fpHOMAS A. EDISON lay tonight in the darkness of a simple grave in
the shadow of a great oak tree in Rosedalc cemetery.
Last tribute over his body was paid as he lay in the drawing-room of
the spacious Victorian mansion in which he had lived for many years.
There assembled his family and his friends to bid him farewell with the
music, the poetry, and the flowers that he loved.
The wife of the President of the United States, whom the inventor
counted among his friends, was present, but there was about the funeral

t little of the stately ceremony one
j would associate with the obsequies
I of a man of world-wide fame.
Dr. Lewis Perry of Phillips Exe
i ter Academy read the tribute, writ
j ten by Arthur J. Palmer, old Edison
j associate.
"He has led no armies into battle,"
I Palmer had written. "He has eon
| quered no countries. He has en
-1 slaved no peoples. Yet, he wields a
i power the magnitude of which no
! warrior ever dreamed."
Mrs. Edison, members of the fam
; ily, and Henry Ford and Harvey
! Firestone remained in an upstairs
| room and heard the service through
| softly toned and amplifying system
I which was connected with a micro-
I phone concealed in the drawing-
I room.
The grief and respect of the en
tire nation were left to be expressed
j in an organized plan sponsored by
! President Hoover for extinguishing
for one minute at 10 o'clock (EST)
the billions of incandescent electric
light globes which illuminate the
; nation s way because of Edison's
1 genius.
