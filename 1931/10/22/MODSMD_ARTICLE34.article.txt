### Dick Rodda 
An Indian squad of 38 men will
leave Palo Alto at 4:20 this after
noon for Seattle to meet Jimmy
Phelan's Washington Huskies Satur
day in Stanford's first invasion of a
rival campus this year.
i The team will hold a light work
out on the practice field at 1 o'clock
! this afternoon before leaving lor
1 the North.
Despite stiff tackling sessions and
! severe scrimmages with ihe Grays
for the first three days of this week,
the squad is in nearly perfect physi
cal condition. Every first-stringer,
with the possible exception of Phil
; Moffatt, will be fit for action in the
Huskie tilt.
MofTatt Out of Play
1 Moffatt will accompany the team,
j but will not play unless absolutely
| necessary. Phil is still weak from
the back injury he received in the
Oregon State game, and Pop War
ner does not want to take any
chances of getting him laid up for
j the season.
Several men were nursing slight.
I bruises after Monday night's prac
tice session, but all were in uni
' forms last night.
Squad Listed

announced by Warner:
Right Ends—Todd, Norgard, I)oul>.

AfTlerbaugh, Wilson.
Quarterbacks and fullbacks—Hill -
man, Allen, Baker, Rintala, Tar

The regular squad took it com
j paratively easier in last night's
j practice. The second and third
! teams scrimmaged against each
! other, and shortly before the ses
! sion closed the Grays came in to
! tangle with the second squad.
Historical Data
Although Washington lost to Ore
-1 gon, who in turn was smothered by
U.S.C., the Huskies will not be easy
' to defeat on their home grounds. If
I the weather is rainy, as it was in
| the Card-Washington game two
years ago, it will be that much
j harder. In that game the Indians
\ wallowed around all afternoon in a
| sea of mud, and were lucky to corn"
j home with a 6 to 0 victory.
' Washington's chief threat is Merle
j Hufford, hard-hitting fullback. Huf
i ford is the most consistent yardage
gainer on the squad, but Chuck
! Winterburn, who scouted the Hus
kies in their game with Idaho last
> week, reports that Phelan has a
! wealth of material in his backfield,
! and a line almost as heavy as the
Oregon State beef trust.

Historical Data
Although Washington lost to Ore
-1 gon, who in turn was smothered by
U.S.C., the Huskies will not be easy
' to defeat on their home grounds. If
I the weather is rainy, as it was in
| the Card-Washington game two
years ago, it will be that much
j harder. In that game the Indians
\ wallowed around all afternoon in a
| sea of mud, and were lucky to corn"
j home with a 6 to 0 victory.
' Washington's chief threat is Merle
j Hufford, hard-hitting fullback. Huf
i ford is the most consistent yardage
gainer on the squad, but Chuck
! Winterburn, who scouted the Hus
kies in their game with Idaho last
> week, reports that Phelan has a
! wealth of material in his backfield,
! and a line almost as heavy as the
Oregon State beef trust.
An Indian squad of 38 men will
leave Palo Alto at 4:20 this after
noon for Seattle to meet Jimmy
Phelan's Washington Huskies Satur
day in Stanford's first invasion of a
rival campus this year.
i The team will hold a light work
out on the practice field at 1 o'clock
! this afternoon before leaving lor
1 the North.
Despite stiff tackling sessions and
! severe scrimmages with ihe Grays
for the first three days of this week,
the squad is in nearly perfect physi
cal condition. Every first-stringer,
with the possible exception of Phil
; Moffatt, will be fit for action in the
Huskie tilt.
MofTatt Out of Play
1 Moffatt will accompany the team,
j but will not play unless absolutely
| necessary. Phil is still weak from
the back injury he received in the
Oregon State game, and Pop War
ner does not want to take any
chances of getting him laid up for
j the season.
