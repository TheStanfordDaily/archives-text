# REBELLIOUS CO-EDS
## 
### 
Freshnven women at Northwestern University have gone
c>n a civil disobedience campaign, following the teachings
of Mahatnia Gandhi, according to a press dispactli. These
rebellious students have declared a strike from all prepa
ration for classes because the school authorities have is
sued Â«in order that all freshmen women students must be
in bed by 10: 30 w'clock.
The striking freshmen insist that this curfew order does
not allow them sufficient time to prepare their lessons and
they steadfastly refuse to prepare any at all until the early
to-bed command is rescinded.
Whether these girls have time to get their lessons or
not, their strike is certainly justified. Too often narrow
minded school officials feel it their God-given duty to im
pose ridiculous rules and restrictions upon university
women, not realizing that the class of the fair sex found
in colleges are quite capable of taking care of themselves
and resent being treated like kindergarten children by the
misguided attempts of the school authorities to play the
part of the fond mother.
It is a relief to see these freshmen women fight for their
l iglits and not weakly submit, like a flock of sheep, to the
mid-Victorian ideas of domineering university officitils.
