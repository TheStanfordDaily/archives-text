# THE 						LESSER EVIL
## 
### 
Stanford students who Jive off-campus have what they
believe to he a legitimate kick in the matter of Daily de
livery this year. They are not receiving their Dailies at
their homes, hut instead must wait until they can pick one
up at the Engineering corner or other places on Quad
where stacks of them are left.
This, at first, seems manifestly unfair. There is no ob
vious reason why these students should be penalized for
living off-campus. Hut the change, which, it is hoped, will
be only temporary, is practically unavoidable..
Like every other college publication, the Daily must
play them close to the financial vest in these parlous times,
(iiven the choice of ceasing, for the time being, off-campus
delivery, which is quite an expensive item, or making dras
tic changes in the paper itself, Daily heads chose what
seemed to them the lesser of two evils.
There is nothing that can be done to remedy the situa
tion now, but with prosperity just around the corner, the
Daily asks the off-eampifc readers to bear with it until that
corner is turned.
