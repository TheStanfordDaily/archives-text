Jn a straw vote for presidential nominations conducted
hv the Daily J\/r Heel, campus paper of the University of
North Carolina, Franklin Roosevelt, Democratic governor
ot New York, leads Owen I). Young, international financier
and also a Democrat, by .'Jfi votes. The Democratic gover
nors of Oklahoma and Maryland, "Alfalfa Hill" Murray
and Albert Ritchie, closely trail the leaders.
The astounding fact is that not a single Republican, not
even Hoover, received a solitary vote.
In commenting on the returns the Tar Heel says, "It
appeared that possibly" the 1032 campaign will see a solid
Democratic South. With similar manifestations coming
from other campus leaders it is increasingly evident that
'as the Tar Ileel goes, so goes the nation,' will be the by
word as the nation's political leaders gather."
Although the students of North Carolina University
may believe that Hoover and the Republicans caused the
depression, the Sino-Jaj )anese war. Edison's death, the hur
ricane in Cuba, and other public calamities, they are pre
suming much in speakinlg for the whole nation.
