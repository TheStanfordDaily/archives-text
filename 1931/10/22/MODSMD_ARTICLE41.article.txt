# BULL SESSION
## CAN COLLEGIANS MAKE THEIR OWN PROGRAM? 
### 
In the dim dark days when
women wore bustles and buggy-rul
ing was considered fast sport, the
person going to college was given a 1
very rigid if not absolute course of I
study—Greek, Latin, and the regu
lar routine. Then in all fields of |
human endeavor, there suddenly
broke forth upon the world cries of
liberty and freedom. The right of
individual expression became para
mount. This was followed by mod
ern psychology warning aW of the
evils and dangers of frustrating hu
man desires—in exes and business
and education as well.
As a result of this new outlook,
the curriculum was liberalized and
the practice of electives became the
symbol of modernism in education.
Even in high school, the range of
choice is very wide; and at college, j
the student is given an even wider j
choice. It must be stated, however,
that at Stanford a considerable i
number of requirements are in
vogue. No one ever seems to ques- i
lion the advisability of permitting
collegians to make out their own
programs; it is taken for granted
like football games, depression, or a ;
fatal disease.
The average student arrives on I
the Farm, fulfills the Lower Divi
sion requirements as soon as he !
possibly can, and then promptly
submerges himself in that line of
activity or those lines in which he
is particularly interested—or in
which he feels he can get by with
the least amount of work. The re
sult is that the graduate is not the
well-rounded individual that a per
son with a college education should
be; he may know his "econ' and
then again he may not even know [

| that. He may be an expert in hy
draulics, and metallurgy—but does
knowing these subjects constitute a
I genuine college education?
Are there not certain subjects
j with which every educated man
\ should have at least a speaking ac
| quaintance? The story of the col
lege graduate who upon being asked
j a general question about ninteenth
i century history, naively replied he
| had specialized in the twentieth, is
I exaggerated, but none the less, in
; dicates a serious condition. Spe
| realization has swept the business
world and stretched its ugly tcn-
I acles into the curriculum of most
i colleges.
To be sure that students gradu
: ating from college really merited
| being called educated men, why not
make the course of study compul
sory to a very large extent? Should
not, every graduate know something
about the major physical sciences,
i philosophy, history, literature, and
' all the rest, including psychology?
I Of course, provision would be made
for high-school or private work
done by the freshman; and in the
last year, or the last quarter, per
j haps, the student could be given a
( free rein to specialize if he desired.
And those students who felt that
; their true individualities were being
i crushed by this system could nur
ture the fragments of their soul
: long enough to get to the library
! or to their favorite professor's of
j fice, where the balm of knowledge
would cement them together again.
! A true desire to advance along one
! path could be realized by outside
reading during and after college,
for no one believes that education
< should cease at graduation.

In the dim dark days when
women wore bustles and buggy-rul
ing was considered fast sport, the
person going to college was given a 1
very rigid if not absolute course of I
study—Greek, Latin, and the regu
lar routine. Then in all fields of |
human endeavor, there suddenly
broke forth upon the world cries of
liberty and freedom. The right of
individual expression became para
mount. This was followed by mod
ern psychology warning aW of the
evils and dangers of frustrating hu
man desires—in exes and business
and education as well.
As a result of this new outlook,
the curriculum was liberalized and
the practice of electives became the
symbol of modernism in education.
Even in high school, the range of
choice is very wide; and at college, j
the student is given an even wider j
choice. It must be stated, however,
that at Stanford a considerable i
number of requirements are in
vogue. No one ever seems to ques- i
lion the advisability of permitting
collegians to make out their own
programs; it is taken for granted
like football games, depression, or a ;
fatal disease.

the Farm, fulfills the Lower Divi

the least amount of work. The re
sult is that the graduate is not the
well-rounded individual that a per

be; he may know his "econ' and
