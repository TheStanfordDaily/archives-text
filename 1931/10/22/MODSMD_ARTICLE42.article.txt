TWENTY-FOUR HOURS — At (lie i
Varsity Theatre.
Watch the Maharajah of India j
ride an elephant, and watch an ani- j
mated cartoon animate, and then. I
see Clive Brook and Kay Francis !
completely engulfed by a story that !
couldn't escape a smattering of gang
shootings and finger marks on the
whiskey bottle.
Miss Francis is quite as lovely as |
ever, but does not appear nearly j
often enough; and we are still ideal- j
istic enough to prefer our Clive j
Brook with a character staunch and
straight enough to match his admir
able manners. Even his firm resolu
tion to reform, in the fadeout, does !
not completely compensate for this !
lapse from customary character.
Withal, it is better than the aver- !
age run of movies, and there is a I
night club singer with a really good i
voice and a fiery spirit. Glimpses of :
falling New York snow constitute I
the best we've seen of photographic
scenic effects in a long time.

MY SIN—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
If you liked the glamorous Tal- :
lulah Bankhead in "Tarnished
Lady,"' you will like her even better :
in "My Sin," now Unreeling al the
New Stanford.
Not that Paramount has given her
so much more in the way of story—

| merely the venerable tale of the
! woman with a past which old as
| sociates keep popping up to remind
I her of.
But it IS well done. Miss Bank
! head is teamed with Frederic March,
! and the pair of them give smooth
| and finished performances that make
: an ordinary vehicle interesting,
j Tallulah wears some ravishing
I clothes and a bathing suit that will
: make you gasp. And she DOESN'T
I wear Eugenie hats!
Good shorts round out the pro
| gram. —M.C.
