I —and we had to put that new
j aluminum Harry at the bookkeeo
j ing, and his arm squeaks terribly.
I I in afraid I'll have to use heavier i

the chromium special over at the
Consolidated.
Wife: That machine made thing!

made family. Where are they going

| Husband: They want to return to
I their birthplace, tyut don't know
J whether to go to the Flexible Iron
