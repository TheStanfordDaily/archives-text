Stanford must he that much BET
TER than Washington in order to
meet the Huskies on EVEN terms
on their home grounds, says "Pop'
Warner. Not just this year, but any
year.
No game in the Old Man's long
experience stands out as more
of a disappointment than the
Washington game of 1925. Pop
considers that 1925 eleven, led
by the great Ernie Nevers, the
best he has turned out at Stan
lord. Vet, playing at Seattle, it
lost a bitter game and the con
ference championship to the
Huskies.
Aside from the fact lhat Warner
has put on a particularly pessimis
tic front this season and is now at
tempting to build up "fear" of an
apparently not-too-strong Washing
ton team, it is a certainty that any
team must be much better than the
Northerners to beat them on their
home lot. Stanford required all the
breaks to snatch a 13 to 7 game from
the Huskies in 1927, and was held
to a G to 0 score two years ago.
One factor that has aided Wash
ington in the past, however, has
been eliminated this year. A turf
field has replaced the mud and
sawdust of the past.
George Ilcrzog is a busy man
these days.
You see, George made a hole
in-one on the Stanford course
last Sunday, and is spending all
his time rounding up the cases
of ginger ale, boxes of golf balls,
and other little mementos of
fered by various companies to
those who sink their tee shots,
ilis greatest concern is that he
will overlook something.
George's ace, scored on the
140-yard eighth, aided him in
touring the course in a sensa
tional 110. Ilis partner, Angclo
May, was thrown off his usual
line game by the dodo, carding
144.
Stanford has no more enthusiastic
supporter than Mrs. Edith Mills,
charming English nurse of the Palo
Alto Hospital.
To those of us incarcerated in that
institution last Saturday, it seemed
that she would never recover from
the shock when Ernie Smith brought
us the information via KFRC that
Phil Moffatt was injured and was
being carried from the field.
The radio soon brought reassuring
information, however, and Mrs.
Mills was much relieved.
Incidentally, she describes cricket
as "slow," but likes Rugby football
better than the American game.

Stanford has no more enthusiastic
supporter than Mrs. Edith Mills,
charming English nurse of the Palo
Alto Hospital.
To those of us incarcerated in that
institution last Saturday, it seemed
that she would never recover from
the shock when Ernie Smith brought
us the information via KFRC that
Phil Moffatt was injured and was
being carried from the field.
The radio soon brought reassuring
information, however, and Mrs.
Mills was much relieved.
Incidentally, she describes cricket
as "slow," but likes Rugby football
better than the American game.

Stanford must he that much BET
TER than Washington in order to
meet the Huskies on EVEN terms
on their home grounds, says "Pop'
Warner. Not just this year, but any
year.
No game in the Old Man's long
experience stands out as more
of a disappointment than the
Washington game of 1925. Pop
considers that 1925 eleven, led
by the great Ernie Nevers, the
best he has turned out at Stan
lord. Vet, playing at Seattle, it
lost a bitter game and the con
ference championship to the
Huskies.
Aside from the fact lhat Warner
has put on a particularly pessimis
tic front this season and is now at
tempting to build up "fear" of an
apparently not-too-strong Washing
ton team, it is a certainty that any
team must be much better than the
Northerners to beat them on their
home lot. Stanford required all the
breaks to snatch a 13 to 7 game from
the Huskies in 1927, and was held
to a G to 0 score two years ago.
One factor that has aided Wash
ington in the past, however, has
been eliminated this year. A turf
field has replaced the mud and
sawdust of the past.
George Ilcrzog is a busy man
these days.
You see, George made a hole
in-one on the Stanford course
last Sunday, and is spending all
his time rounding up the cases
of ginger ale, boxes of golf balls,
and other little mementos of
fered by various companies to
those who sink their tee shots,
ilis greatest concern is that he
will overlook something.
George's ace, scored on the
140-yard eighth, aided him in
