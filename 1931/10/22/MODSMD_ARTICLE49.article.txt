i includes Van Kirk, Bates, and
Pope, centers; Mottram, Semmelroth,
j Cook, Loomis, guards; Keller, Let
; tunich, Steiner, and Savage, tackles;
Kahn, Abrahamson, Durkee, Cot
j ton, and Schween, ends; Flannagan,
I Strong, and Avery, quarters; Moore,

Practice Defense
, Last night the Cardinal babes re-
I peated their strenuous workouts
I against the Grays. Emphasis v/as
I on defense against the U.S.C. power
i plays and especially against forward
passes.
Followers of the freshman activi
! ties at California and Stanford will
i have their first opportunity of gaug
ing the respective strengths of these
! teams via the comparative score
l method after the festivities are over
: Saturday.
Bakersfield Good
| While the Cardinal yearlings are
grappling with their Southern Cali
; fornia rivals, California will take on
Bakersfield Junior College. The lat
ter outfit battered the Indian frosh
by a score of 16 to 0 last week, and
j although they were playing a sec-
I ond-string team for the majority
; of the game, they displayed plenty
' of stuff.
; Stanford's first-year men are now
lat the stage of the season where
they should begin to produce. They
j will have to show improved strength
against the Trobabes or be definitely
i relegated to a back seat. Early sea
[ son "reports saw a better than aver
| age team here on the Farm, and
| they were moving right along until
j stories of these great California
| Cubs across the bay appeared and
j cast a shadow on the Stanford hopes
for a successful year.
It is entirely within possibilities
[ for the Cardinal frosh to start click
r ing down South and do a little scor
ing themselves against these Tro
! jans. And on the other hand, it's pos
| sible for the S.C. babes, furious by
1 their stunning defeat at the hands
| of California, to whip into our frosh
with vengeance in mind.
