# SOCCER VARSITY'S FORWARD-LINE HAS BETTER ATTACK AFTER POSITION SHIFT
## 
### 
Following the intensive concen- j
tration on the passing of the for- !
ward line Monday and Tuesday, I
Coach Maloney shifted his varsity I
soccer lineup last night by moving j
Captain Falk over to Ted Beggs' '
piace at inside right and putting 1
Eeggs at left inside.
The result was more than grati- ;
fying, and the varsity showed some i
real passing ability for the first I
time. This was most noticeable when j
they took the ball up the field j
through the entire second team, and j
without hesitating centered the bal! i
to Falk who booted it past Goalie j
Williams.
Art Hearn received a hard blow j
on his injured knee, which had
nearly healed, but it is expected |
that he will be in shape for the
San Jose game Saturday. The scrim
mage also marked the return to the
first-string lineup of Emmet Haye.i
at right half. Hayes is receiving stiff i
competition from Alex Spoehv, of !
last year's frosh, which bids well for :
future soccer varsities.
With the advent of five more as- j

pi ring frosh soccer enthusiasts, j
Coach Eberhart has slightly more j
than two full teams. And judging j
by their first-week performances ;
they will be hard to keep out of
the lineup.
What is at present the frosh var
sity team was pitted against a com
bination sccond and third team from
| the varsity last night, and the |
i youngsters had a 1-0 lead until i
Eberhart threw in Cyril Johnston at |
center forward for the varsity.
The frosh kept the ball in enemy |
J territory most of the time, and Eit- i
' nier's scoring kick came as the cli- j
i max to some excellent passing on r
; the part of Sutow and Emerick. j
Kennedy, center half, is one of the
best feeders and defensive men that s
a frosh team has had for some time.
The frosh are working hard for
their game with Pescadero High
Friday afternoon. The high-school
: boys invariably have a sniooth
working team that takes the frosh
into camp handily. It looks at pres
ent as if it may be different this
i year.

through the entire second team, and j
without hesitating centered the bal! i
to Falk who booted it past Goalie j
Williams.
Art Hearn received a hard blow j
on his injured knee, which had
nearly healed, but it is expected |
that he will be in shape for the
San Jose game Saturday. The scrim
mage also marked the return to the
first-string lineup of Emmet Haye.i
at right half. Hayes is receiving stiff i
competition from Alex Spoehv, of !
last year's frosh, which bids well for :
future soccer varsities.
With the advent of five more as- j

pi ring frosh soccer enthusiasts, j
Coach Eberhart has slightly more j
than two full teams. And judging j
by their first-week performances ;
they will be hard to keep out of
the lineup.
What is at present the frosh var
sity team was pitted against a com
bination sccond and third team from
| the varsity last night, and the |
i youngsters had a 1-0 lead until i
Eberhart threw in Cyril Johnston at |
center forward for the varsity.
The frosh kept the ball in enemy |
J territory most of the time, and Eit- i
' nier's scoring kick came as the cli- j
i max to some excellent passing on r
; the part of Sutow and Emerick. j
Kennedy, center half, is one of the
best feeders and defensive men that s
a frosh team has had for some time.
The frosh are working hard for
their game with Pescadero High
Friday afternoon. The high-school
: boys invariably have a sniooth
working team that takes the frosh
into camp handily. It looks at pres
ent as if it may be different this
i year.
