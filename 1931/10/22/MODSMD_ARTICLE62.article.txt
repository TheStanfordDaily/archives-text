# Bear Groomed For Trojan Grid Party
## Grim Attitude Taken as Team Works on Own Faults; Not Concerned by Southerners' Strength 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 21.—(Special to
' Stanford Daily)— That the Univer
! sity of Southern California Trojans
J may beat California Saturday but
| will not push ihe Bears all over the
j field was the emphatic declaration
! of Coach Bill Ingram tonight,
j "California may be beaten, but if
will not be disgraced," said the Eear
| leader.
| Tips from the Southland are to

the effect that the Trojans will spare
no effort to run up a staggering
score on the California team. In
gram and his Golden Bears are
singularly unruffled by the threat—
not because they believe it to be
unfounded in fact, but because they
are going to do their business in the
j same way that has so far marked
| their preparations for critical games.
Defense Drill
Ingram has taught his squad to be
concerned i>bout their own faults,
rather than to worry about the ,
strength of opponents. For that rea
son, the Bears are quietly continu
ing their efforts to perfect teamwork
and individual performance. Further
improvement of an aheady strong
defense against running plays and
constant drilling to improve an ad
mittedly ineffective pass defense
have been on the Bear program this
week.
For the winner of Saturday's 1
classic, victory will mean a substan
tial step forward in the race for the !
conference title, since the opponent*
are at present tied arithmetically
with Stanford for first place—Cali
fornia by a thrilling victory over
last year's champions, Washington
State, and Southern California by
lop-sided wins over Oregon State,
Washington State, and Oregon.
Injuries Costly
Injuries struck twice in the Bear
camp this week, removing a first
string end and a second-string half
back from the roster. Louis Dißesta,
who last week outplayed All-Amer
ican "Turk" Edwards, of the Cou
gars, is on the shelf for six weeks
due to a fractured bone in his right
foot. Joe Cattolica, transfer student
j. who lias fought his way up from
| obscurity this season, broke a small
j bone in the palm of his left hand
! during practice Monday night, and
! will not see action again for at least
j two weeks.
All indications point to Ingram's
! using virtually the same team, with
! these exceptions, as started in last
I week's game.
