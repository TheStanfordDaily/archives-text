# FARM DEPRESSION CAUSES BUSINESS COLLAPSE-HYDE
## Ten Year Overproduction In Agriculture Leads To Labor Crash 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 21. (/P)â€”Secre
tary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde
said today that the present business
and industrial condition was the di
rect result of the agricultural de
pression of the past ten years.
The Secretary was a speaker at
the eighth conference of major in
dustdies, held at Columbia Univer
sity.
Contributing Causes
"There is no longer any debate as
to the cause of the agricultural col
lapse," said Secretary Hyde. "There
are many contributory causes, but
the one cause which stands out
above all its overproduction. One
year of overproduction is not in
itself fatal but ten years is more
than any industry can stand."
The principal factor in agricul
tural overproduction -is the uneco
nomic use of land, Secretary Hyde
said.
Planting Limit Needed
"The present policy of unplanned
agriculture must be replaced by a
policy of scientific utilization of our
land, providing for its protection
against erosion and limiting our
agricultural plant to such size as
will supply our national needs with
out the blight of overproduction,"
he said. "What agriculture now
needs is not more wheat lands but
more forests, more game reserves,
more airports, more and larger golf
courses, and more city farmers with
larger estates and smaller produc
tion.
"Ours has been a policy not of
land use but of land exploitation.
We have proceeded on the theory,
never seriously questioned, that
what we needed was to bring more
land into cultivation."
