### 
Pulling a big surprise out of a
brand new bag of tricks, Verne
Brown and his committeemen in
charge of the Encina Club election
last night discovered and made the
announcement at a candidates' as
sembly in Encina lobby that in com
piling a list of officers everybody
had forgotten to remember that the
club must have a manager. And the
frosh, being frosh, didn't know
about it and consequently did not
nominate any candidates for the of
fice.
At a special nomination period
last evening "Tilly" Schween, James
Ray, Gordon Langsdorf, John Brock,
Harry Coty, and Roy Drew were
named as candidates for the office.
This increases the number of of
fices to be filled tomorrow to six.
Four declinations were received
also, Brown stated. These are from
Glenn Martineau, Bob Starkweather,
and James Ray for president and
Harry Williamson for smoker chair
man.
The last-minute addition of the
six candidates for the position of
manager brought the total number
of those running up to 52, which is
slightly over one-sixth of the club
membership.
At a meeting in Encina lobby yes
terday at 7 o'clock, all candidates
were introduced to the voters. It. is
still doubtful whether the attend
ance of those voting was greater
than those running for office, or
vice-versa.
Through an error in the handling
of petitions, the name of Milt Keller
was omitted from the list of candi
dates for vice-president and he was
not introduced at the assembly last
night. Keller is a member of the
frosh football squad.
Voting will be held this evening
from 7 to 9 o'clock in the lobby and

thereafter as possible. Dick Hoff
man and Gilbert Carr are assisting
Brown in handling the election.
