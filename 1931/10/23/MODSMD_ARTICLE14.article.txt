# FINISHED WORK FORECAST FOR CAMPUS PLAY
## Present Rehearsals Show Promise Of Finished Production 
### 
If present rehearsals may be taken
las a criterion Stanford playgoars
; will witness one of the most finished
'of Dramatic Council productions
when "Berkeley Square" is given
; on October 30.
1 "A play of imaginative delicacy
! and charm, of wit and of romance.
! One of the most completely satis
factory plays now available," was
the opinion of Richard Lockridge,
dramatic critic of the "Evening Sun",
| concerning John Balderston's fasci
j nating comedy when it was pro
| duced in New York.
Plot Unusual
"Berkeley Square" is unusual in
plot and philosophy. It offers ample
â–  opportunity for finesse and repartee
I timing. Balderston has written his
speeches, usually of several com
plex lines, which require' quick
: transitions from one emotional value*
to another. These nuances of emo
tion are requiring a great deal of
attention and training for almost
j everyone in the cast.
As only two characters are play
j ing roles similar to those they have
taken in previous productions this
i play has provided actors with the
i chance of showing their versatility.
Catherine Crary, cast as Lady Anne,
and David Dickey, who is playing
Lord Stanley, should prove to be
particularly interesting.
One of the most outstanding
New Roles
j changes of characterizations will be
that taken by Peg Randall Converse.
Although all of her previous leads
have been along the comedy line she
i is taking a rather serious, dignified,
and charming young girl part in this
play. Nothing could have been found
j more in contrast with her earlier
farcical, whimsy, almost describable
as "flibberty-jibberty" roles.
Dorothy Tully is another accom
plished actress who will be called
i upon for an entirely different in
terpretation from her former work.
She is to be a very self-assured,
competent, and polished society girl
of the 18th century.
Tickets for the play will be on
sale early next week and it is
recommended that students pur
chase them the first day of the sale
so that they may procure the best
possible seats. Considerable interest
has been shown among theatregoers
on the Peninsula in the selection of
j "Berkeley Square," according to
Helvenston.
