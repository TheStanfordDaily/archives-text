### 
Some fellows go to the Theta
house for females, but Herb
Long, '33, goes there for his
mail. (Joke?.)
It seems that Long, who is a
member of Kappa Alpha fra
ternity, is listed in this quar
ter's bawlout as "Kappa Al
pha Theta." This twist of res
idence is nothing new for the
bawlout, which last year listed
a prominent Alpha O as an
ATO. However, the postoffice
authorities here take the bawl
out seriously, and so every
morning Long treks over to the
Theta house to get the letters
sent there by the mail chief
tains.
