# Quad Pictures Will Be Taken In New Studio
## First Senior Pictures Are Scheduled Monday 
### 
Inaugurating a new system of in
dividual photography for the Uni
versity yearbook, first senior pic
tures for the 1932 Quad will be
taken Monday morning in the new
studios in the Press Annex across
the street from the Press Building.
The building, formerly housing
the offices of the Department of
Physical Education for Women, has
been remodeled and decorated to
suit the needs of the Quad staff.
This will be the lirst time the Quad
has had its own private studio on
the campus.
U.C. Photographers
The photography this year will be
handled by the John Watson Stu
dios of Berkeley, photographers for
â–  the Blue and Gold, U.C. annual.
Mrs. Watson will personally attend
to the photography.
The change to a private campus
studio was made to avoid the dis
tractions and lack of privacy in the
Old Union, location of the Quad
photographic rooms in the past,
stated Editor Tom Aitken yesterday.
It is hoped that the new location
will facilitate individual attention
and enable the Berkeley firm to do
justice to each subject.
All Work Here
The campus studio includes a
waiting roonv reception room, and
mounting, photographic, and dress
ing rooms. All work will be done
here, cxcept the developing and
printing which will be done at Ber
keley.
The Watson Studios take about
sixty-five individual photographs on
the California campus, said Aitken,
while the Quad hopes to take about
fifty. Complete details of the alpha
betical system and the studio office
hours will be released Monday.
