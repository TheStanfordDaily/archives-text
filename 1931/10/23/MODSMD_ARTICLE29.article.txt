# Warner Predicts Vicious Struggle In Husky Game
## Indians, 39 Strong, Head North in Dark About Chances For Victory; Pop to Start First String Against Strong University of Washington Eleven LACOMBE OUT OF HOSPITAL; TO MAKE TRIP Purple and Gold Pointed for Stanford, While Reds Must Look Forward to Thundering Herd 
### 
FIVE HUNDRED of the faithful huddled in the lee of the Southern
Pacific depot yesterday afternoon to hear Coach Pop Warner predict
a vicious battle for Stanford when the varsity faces the Washington
Husky at Seattle tomorrow. The Indians, 39 strong, pulled freight at
4:20 o'clock after Warner had remarked that nobody was more in tin
dark about Stanford's real ability than he was. "Stanford has not been
holding back in previous games as some newspapermen have intimated
| ♦ We will start our first string—those

of them that are able to play,"
Warner ended.
Emil "Frenchy" Lacombe was re
leased from the hospital where he
had been confined since Wednesday
night with a touch of flu, and was
aboard when the train pulled out.
Light Scrimmage
Earlier in the afternoon the In
dians went through dummy scrim
mage against Washington plays. All
the cripple? were in acceptable
shape, ready to go against the
Husky, but Warner probably will
not start either Phil Moffatt with
his bruised back or Windy Bigelow
with his trick shoulder. Either or
both are ready for duty, however.

Tentative lineups for tomor
row's game:
Stanford Washington
Colvin LER Smith
Hand LTR Wiatrak
Hulen LGR O'Brien
Milligan C Howard
Corbus RGL Palmer
"Ehrhorn RTL Schwegler
Tod REL Nisbet
H. Hillman QB Sohn or
Wolcott
Campbell LHR Bledsoe
Caddell RHL Hufford
Allen FB Cherberg

The Purple and Gold are "point
ed" for Stanford, while it is no
secret that Warner is looking past
Washington toward Southern Cali
fornia. On their home field the
Northerners are plain poison, and m
the last six years Stanford has
beaten them twice by one touch
down and lost a third by two touch
downs. If it rains Saturday, Stan
ford will be handicapped more than
will be the Huskies, who use few
if any double pass plays.
lluiTorri Unlucky
Merle Hufford is the key man of
Coach Jimmy Phelan's attack, al
. though in the past two years he has
[ not had much luck with the Stan
. ford line. This year, however. Phe
lan has a youngster named Benny
Sohn to back him up. Sohn is sup
, posed to be the last word in safety
men, and tougher than a six days'
beard. They call him "Gangster" p.t
Washington.
In the line the Huskies have Paul
Schwegler, six feet two of Class A
tackle, heading a big, fast, but rather
inexperienced, line. Newspaper re
ports indicate that Oregon was
lucky to beat the Huskies, 13-0, an.
intercepted pass that resulted in a
j Webfoot touchdown choking ofT
Washington at the goal line. Previ
ous to that the Huskies beat the
powerful Utah eleven and last week
I they drubbed Idaho, 38-7, indicating
I that they possess scoring power as
well as a tight defense.

FIVE HUNDRED of the faithful huddled in the lee of the Southern
Pacific depot yesterday afternoon to hear Coach Pop Warner predict
a vicious battle for Stanford when the varsity faces the Washington
Husky at Seattle tomorrow. The Indians, 39 strong, pulled freight at
4:20 o'clock after Warner had remarked that nobody was more in tin
dark about Stanford's real ability than he was. "Stanford has not been
holding back in previous games as some newspapermen have intimated
| ♦ We will start our first string—those

of them that are able to play,"
Warner ended.
Emil "Frenchy" Lacombe was re
leased from the hospital where he
had been confined since Wednesday
night with a touch of flu, and was
aboard when the train pulled out.
Light Scrimmage
Earlier in the afternoon the In
dians went through dummy scrim
mage against Washington plays. All
the cripple? were in acceptable
shape, ready to go against the
Husky, but Warner probably will
not start either Phil Moffatt with
his bruised back or Windy Bigelow
with his trick shoulder. Either or
both are ready for duty, however.

Tentative lineups for tomor
row's game:
Stanford Washington
Colvin LER Smith
Hand LTR Wiatrak
Hulen LGR O'Brien
Milligan C Howard
Corbus RGL Palmer
"Ehrhorn RTL Schwegler
Tod REL Nisbet
H. Hillman QB Sohn or
Wolcott
Campbell LHR Bledsoe
Caddell RHL Hufford
Allen FB Cherberg

The Purple and Gold are "point
ed" for Stanford, while it is no
secret that Warner is looking past
Washington toward Southern Cali
fornia. On their home field the
Northerners are plain poison, and m
the last six years Stanford has
beaten them twice by one touch
down and lost a third by two touch
downs. If it rains Saturday, Stan
ford will be handicapped more than
will be the Huskies, who use few
if any double pass plays.
