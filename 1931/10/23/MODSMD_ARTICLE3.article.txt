LONDON, Oct. 22. (/P) â€”Bootleg- j
ging in the United States results in
the corruption of police and law i
courts, but that is no reason for j
doing away with prohibition, George j
Bernard Shaw told the World Pro-
hibition Federation today.
He attacked tipplers who utilize I
the glass to obtain jollity or cour- !
age, saying he should feel ashamed j
if he had to resort to such meas- j
ures. And he accused Gilbert Ches- \
terton of being a "secret teetotaler" j
because Chesterton "is so very loud" j
in singing the praises of wine.
