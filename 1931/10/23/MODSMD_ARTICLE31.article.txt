# PAN-HELLENIC STANDS PAT
## 
### 
Listing six definite reasons, Pan-Hellenic at the Univer
sity of (California this week rejected a plan for deferred
bidding of women, such as is in effect at Stanford.
Anions the reasons given for the rejection were these:
First, housing facilities near the campus were considered
inadequate for the large group of women who would he
forced to live in hoarding houses if the plan were carried
through. Second, the rushing period would thus he length
ened from two weeks to six months, involving a strain on
hot 11 sororitv women and the rushees. Third, Pan-Hellenic
is attempting to minimize the importance of sororities, and
the proposed system would tend to emphasize it.
The new plan differed from the one in vogue here in
that while bidding would he deferred six months, rushing
would he carried on at any time after the start of school.
That that would he a strain, financial and otherwise, on
both the sorority and the rushee is apparent, but a system
of deferred rushing might solve the problem. As it is,
pledging at California is done in a sheep-herding manner
Hint is nothing more than high-pressure salesmanship of
the first water. No girl can choose in two weeks the group
she wishes to live with for the rest of her college life and
know anything about them. Hut it is pledge or be ofi' the
boat forever at (Californiaâ€”much more so than at Stanford
and for that reason many girls take the brass Mindly.
The Daily is not in favor of deferred rushing for junior
transfer women, but it heartily endorses the scheme for
freshmen. If Stanford women do not know what they are
stepping into when they pledge, at least it is not for lack
of opportunity to learn.
