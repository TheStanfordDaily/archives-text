Now that the rainy season lias started and people are
going about in an atmosphere of thanksgiving, there is
still a fly in the ointment, or rather, puddles in the paths.

and a keen sense of perception to avoid a messy welting in
the lakes and quagmires that obstruct the walks.

luimor and drv shoe-leather would be tremendous.
