# A 						GOOD START
## 
### 
A Stanford student, convicted for the second time of
violation of the Honor ('ode, was prohibited from ever
registering in the University again by the Men's Gounc.il.
I his action by the council is a good start toward the
enforcement of the code, but the council cannot stop with
this one penally. The success of the Honor Gode lies in its
slricl enforcement and the council must deal with its vio
lators with an iron hand if this system is going to be more
than just a tradition.
The main objection to the code is that if is unenforce
able; students are slow to report violations that they ob
serve and when such reports are turned in the action taken
against the offenders has been far from satisfactory, the
culprits escaping with a warning or a light sentence.
The penalty inflicted last Wednesday indicates that Ihe
Men's Gouncil has taken a firm stand against the violators.
I'ut an initial stand is not enough; il must be maintained.
Students, realizing that thev are tlie ones who are suf
fering from cheating, are beginning to have less qualms
about reporting the flagrant violations of the code. Thus
il lies with the Men's Gouncil by clamping down on the
cheaters to make the Honor Gode a success.
