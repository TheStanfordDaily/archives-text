Members of one sororilv at the I"iiivcrsitv of Missouri (
have swung into step with the limes and pledged them
selves to economy on dates. In fact, their soda fountain
hills are to he limited to a nickel when they are on a date.
We suppose that holds the girls down to cokes, phosphates,
or pcrluips a sack of peanuts or a chocolate har served with
a jljlass of water.

The girls claimed that il wasn't because of any lack of
dates, which might or might not have resulted from the
depression, hut that some of the fathers had been sending
smaller checks this vear. Thus the hoy-friend is to have

a break,.
With the coke the standard order on this campus, we
don't see any hope for cutting down on the cost of dates
in that manner the women usually order modestly.

Ihit we hope that the men won't practice tile old dodge
of letting his date order a coke and then have a malt and a
sandwich himself. The worst offense, however, is that
practiced on Friday and Saturday nights. No explanation
is needed for the fact that all the campus confectioneries
are crowded after when all the women are safely at'
home. Heprinted from the Ddilif lllini.
