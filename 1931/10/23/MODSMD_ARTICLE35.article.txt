# BULL SESSION
## GENTLEMEN—"TO THE 500" 
### 
Long long ago some rough after
calling up three sororities and then
| Roble without any success, cleaned
his teeth with Fordhan's toothpaste
(advt.), and prepared for bed. Sud
denly he grew taut and, from the
startled expression on his face, one
could discern an idea was in con
ception. Then in a lotid voice, he
bellowed forth—"Four Out of Five
I Have IT and the Fifth Comes to
Stanford." The idea spread and soon
from the marshy mosquito beds of
Lagunita to the flat stretches of the
flying field—from the rolling foot-
I hills to the bay—the now familiar
cry echoed and re-echoed.
Whether the rough in question
I was justified then is not of present
i consequence. But that the "500" of
today should bear the stigma that
once branded their possibly less fan
sisters in that dark day is of vital
importance. It is the men in a uni
versity who rate the women —recre-
ational ly as well as statistically. The
I male population judges feminine
pulchritude by the facility of get
ting dates; the woman proves her
i beauty by accepting the invitation.
If she doesn't accept, it is evident
that she is not worthwhile taking
out; and the male ego can only be
preserved by that interpretation.
I The other and more obvious ex
planation of the refusal is passed
by without so much as a passing
1 thought.
I At Stanford, the situation is ag

j gravated by the fact that the women
I are on the short end of six to one
[ odds. By the mere application of
! simple mathematics, it is obvious
! that the '"500" must turn down many
1 dates, and their popularity decreases
1 in direct proportion to their refusals.
The final logic would be, that no
; one would call for dates; the final
; logic of the case, however, is never
' quite reached because the distance to
[ the city or the East Bay and the
effort expended to reach
sources of supply defeats the na
tural antagonism to the '500."
Of course, facts are not available;
but in this writer's opinion there is
a larger percentage of good-looking
women on the Farm than at any
j other major university in California
I —and including Mills too, for those
j that love to beat a trail across the
, foggy wastes of Dumbartondom. The
| only trouble is, one can't take out a
] "percentage"; something more tan
; gible is needed. If every one of the
j "500" were the incarnation of Venus,
| Dietrich, Garbo, and Bankhead
(which they are not) all rolled into
i one with Helen of Troy and Cleo
{ patra of Caesar (and Anthony)
I thrown in, there would still be about
2,500 Stanford men who would hold
the same opinions as they now hold.
, And if there were G,OOO women at
| Stanford, they would be considered
j attractive by most men no matter
[ what they looked like.
