JOHN MISTLETOE—By Christo
pher Morley. Garden City, N.Y.
1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Mcrley. calls this book "his own.
grammar of surprise." He says,
. Mistletoe feels, and has long
felt, a concern to explore the mem
ories of thirty years or so and Day,
This was beautiful; this had a mean
ing." Morley writes about all these
memories of his and writes a great
deal besides. His style might be
called gossipy, if it were not couched
in the elegant Morley English. He
mixes anecdotes and bits of philo
sophy with the story of his own
early schooling, his experience at
Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, his
i early professional life among the
publishing houses in New York, and
finally of the beginning of his liter
ary success.
i There are reminiscences of the
early days of G. K. Chesterton and
Hilaire Belloc. It seems as if Morley
had included everything from scraps
of Chinese poetry to an amusing al
lusion to Don Marquis. He tells us
that the box on which Marquis used
to sit to prepare copy was labeled,
"1 GROSS TOM CATS," which-re
ferred to tomato catsup, but which,
Morley suggests, may have been die
inspiration for the start of Mehita
ble's carer. —E.T.P.

! THE TEN COMMANDMENTS—By ]
Warwick Deeping. New York,
1931. Alfred A. Knopf. $2.50.
Youth once more reyolts against I
old age. Young England scorns j
moss-covered towers and hawthorn ;
i hedges and the conventions of cour- j
i tesy and respect. Young England '
| refuses to dream, and even to think i
| seriously, because action holds so |
| much moi'e of positive excitement. !
But the novel concerns itself with j
| the development of a girl who is j
' deprived of this activity, and forced
I to live at the more considerate pace
! of her elders; with the growth of a
j beautiful spirit from a foundation
i of conceit and selfishness.
Warwick's characters live, and
i have color. His young revolutionists i
j are painted with understanding, and
j not with a brush of relentless mor
! ality. His physical, geographical
j England is beautiful, and we feel
quite alive with the frail heroine
j who finds that her submission to
I the Ten Commandments makes pos
l sible the realization of the eleventh
commandment of her mother: "I
! want you to marry your lover and j
be happy."
Very emphatically a book to be j
l ead slowly, and remembered.
