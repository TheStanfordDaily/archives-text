lIOOUAH FOR Hu.rtß AND ABE!
; The Editor, Sir:
Let me express the hearty con
, currence of those interested in
; forming the Stanford units of the
! Hoover '32 Club with the views ex
j pressed in the able article of Mr.
| Mellinkoff in the Wednesday Daily,
i Obviously it would be the blindest
I sort of folly for "the sons and
| daughters of the Stanford Fled" to
| cast their votes for Hoover solely
| because they attend this University.
We are interested only in the en-
I rollment of those who, after full
j deliberation, feel that the President
j has filled his high office with honor
I and ability, and who wish to u?e
j this means of expressing their sym-
I pathy and confidence in what he is

doing. And frankly, at this stage
of the game, with the election a year
off and with the name of this op
ponent unknown, it takes more than
the usual amount of faith to do this.
But realizing that there is not a
little pro-Hoover sentiment on the
campus we have undertaken the or
ganization of the '32 Club.
