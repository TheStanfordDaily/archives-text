Until today, it has been com
monly believed that rat races
were indigenous to Sequoia
Hall, due to the practice of the
residents of that establishment
of holding such performances
several times a week. Yester
day, Professor A. B. Miles stole
some of the Sequoia thunder
and held a rat race before his
11-o'clock psychology class.
Each of the rats ran singly, and
along an elevated maze rather
than a track.
It is reported that betting
was not heavy.
