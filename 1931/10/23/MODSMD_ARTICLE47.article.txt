# Y.W. FRIDAY PARTY GUESTS TO LEARN CONTRACT BRIDGE
## 
### 
The second of the weekly Friday
night parties sponsored by the Y.W.
C.A. will be given in the "Y" rooms
on the third floor of the Women's
Clubhouse tonight from 7:15 to 9:00
o'clock. Mrs. Ben S. Allen, secretary
of the "Y," will give contract bridge
lessons and other entertainment will
consist of popping corn and roasting
marshmallows. All new women,
whether members of the "Y" or not,
are invited.
The Y.W.C.A. drive for member
ship came to an official close last
night with a total of 232 members,
152 of which are active and engaged
in committee work. The member
ship list by houses is as follows:
Alpha Omicron Pi, 7; Alpha Phi, 8;
Chi Omega, 17; Delta Delta Delta,
11; Delta Gamma, 7; Gamma Phi, 14;
Kappa Alpha Theta, 18; Kappa Kap
pa Gamma, 13; and Pi Beta Phi, 13.
The total is an increase over last
year's membership list.
Shaving in the dark is made easy
by a small electric light attached to
the handle of a safety razor.
