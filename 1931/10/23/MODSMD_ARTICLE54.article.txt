# Indian Frosh Go South Tonight For Trobabe Clash
## FRESHMAN SQUAD REACHES PEAK FOR IMPORTANT GAME Regulars Return To Lineup After Long Inaction; U.S.C. Is Powerful 
### Francis Hamilton 
With all men excepting Lawry
Rothert at the peak of condition, a
Stanford freshman football squad of
twenty-seven will leave tonight with
Coaches Bradshaw and Heineke for
Los Angeles. They will play South
ern California's Trobabes in the Col
iseum tomorrow, in the Cardinal
team's first and only game off the
Farm this year.
Rothert has developed a slight hip
injury that may keep him out of the
contest tomorrow, but his post at
left half is one where Coach Brad
i-haw has no lack of capable mate
rial. The diminuative Bowles, who
was expected to share the assign
ments wilh Rothert anyway, will
start the game. He has been out of
action since the Los Angeles Junior
College contest, in which he played
a brilliant role at the safety position.
Regulars Return
Two other regulars will be com
peting for the first time in several
weeks. Van Kirk, who did outstand
ing work in the Los Angeles J.C.
affair himself, will add strength to
Ihe Indian forward wall at center.
Semmelroth, who pairs with Johnny
Mot tram at guard, will also start.
Coach Bradshaw announced his
line-up last evening. It consists of
Abrahamson and Kahn, ends; Kel
ler and Lcttunich, tackles; Mottram
and Semmelroth, guards; Van Kirk,
center; Bowles and Moore, halves;
Flannagan, quarter, and Seaver at
full.
Have Even Chance
Concerning his chances for a vic
tory over the S.C. babes, Bradshaw
considers that things are even, with
the odds, if any, going to the south
ern team because they will be play
ing on their home field.
Both the Stanford and the South
ern California freshmen have been
handed a pair of defeats this year.
Stanford lost twice in a row, once
to the U.C.L.A. cubs and later to
Bakersfield Junior College. On the
other hand, the Trobabes took a wal
loping last Saturday from California
after dropping an early season tilt
to Compton J.C. One need not speak
here of the Bear Cub team's power.
11 is unquestionably a superior year
ling aggregation. Neither is Comp
'ton to be overlooked. Last year they
had one of the most formidable jun
ior college crews in California, win
ning from Mcnlo for ihe state cham
pionship.
S.C. Looks Strong
Southern California has a power
ful team. Despite their loss against
California they collected plenty of
ground from scrimmage during that
to 0 drubbing that they received.
After reading in the accounts of the
game that Southern California rolled
up thirteen first downs while the
Bears were accumulating eight, one
wonders how they lost by such a J
one-sided score.
It is almost the end of the season
for the Indian team. If ever they are j
going to click as a unit, it will be in [
Ibis game, and hopes for a Stanford !
victory are based on the tradition j
that Stanford teams grow better as j
the season advances. In importance j
1o the lrosh, tomorrow's game is |
only comparable to the California |
Cub clash, and Coach Bradshaw ;
makes no secret of the fact that he i
has pointed very much for ihe Tro- j
babes. We pick Stanford to get hot !
and clean up.
