# Red Woodworth Now Playing Pro Football, While Savoldi, Macaluso, Turn to Wrestling
## 
### 
Where do they go, the big heroes
of the fall, when next summer comes
around? I mean the ones who leave
college—what becomes of last year's
gridiron stars? What do they do for
a living, and for exercise? Some, it
seems, combine getting exercise
with earning a living; "Jumping
Joe" Savoldi, "Red" Woodworth, and
Len Macaluso, for instance. This
trio of footballers were the talk of
last fall, along with certain other
rough gents like Turk Edwards,
Fred Sington, Ben Ticknor, March -
mont Schwartz, Frank Carideo,
Ernie Pinckert, and Wesley Fesler.
Red Woodworth of Northwestern
was a picturesque individual who
played a whale of a game at guard
for Dick Hanley's Wildcats, and
never forgot his first love, outboard
motorboat racing. This dramatic
youth, who seldom wore a head

j guard over that shock of bright red
hair of his, is now earning his bread
| and butter as a member of those
tough Green Bay Packers, one of
the better pro football outfits.
Jumping Joe Savoldi and Len
' Macaluso turned to the gentle art
of wrestling, which, as it is put on
! nowadays, is never gentle, seldom
jan art, and hardly wrestling. Both
! Savoldi and Macaluso are Italians,
both played fullback last year, and
both are immensely powerful fel
lows who should go a long way in
the mat game. When Jumping Joe
wedlocked himself out of Notre
Dame he opened the way for Maca
luso to make the All-America team,
! for Savoldi was even stronger and
lan even harder runner than the
Colgate terror. Ask Southern Meth
odist, the Navy, Pitt, Indiana, and
I Penn if he was good!
