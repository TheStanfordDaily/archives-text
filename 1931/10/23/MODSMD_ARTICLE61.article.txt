BEARS OR BUMS?
With both the varsity and frosh
elevens traveling, the campus will
be without a grid attraction tb's
week-end for the first time this sea
son.
Doubtless many will be lured from
the Farm to Berkeley tomorrow to
see Bill Ingram's proteges prove
themselves Bears or merely bums.
The current rainstorm should
he of real aid to California in
holding the Trojans. Memory
goes back to that scoreless mud
epic of three years ago, when
there wasn't so much as a heavy
dew to account for the moist
condition of the Memorial Sta
dium gridiron.
Meanwhile, the California turf,
non-existent in 1928, is not much
better this year. There is no telling
what a real honesl-to-good:iess
rain will do to it. Mud stopped Wil
liams on that memorable occasion,
and it certainly wouldn't be an aid
to Mohler tomorrow.
Mud or no mud, however, it
would be nothing short of a miracle
if the crippled Bears should come
through with a victory. They may,
or may not hold the Trojans to a
respectable score. Our guess is that
they will.
Ed Lynch, San Francisco
wrestling impressario, is seek
ing to rematch "Casey" Kazan -
jian, former Stanford athlete,
and "Jumping Joe" Savoldi, ex-
Notre Dame grid star.
The last time the pair met it
proved nothing more than that
they both possessed hard heads.
After each had won a fall they
suddenly dove at each other,
crashing together in mid-air.
That ended festivities for the
evening, as both were knocked
out cold.
He's at it again. That is, Howard
Jones is opening his annual feuds
with rival coaches. Just now, he is
giving vent to his feelings about
Bill Ingrim. The particular excuse
is the strange coincidence that Cali
fornia should have a strong year
ling team following Navy Bill's
summer tour of the state, including
Southern California's weak points.
Wonder what he will dig up to
get mad at "Pop" about the week
before November seventh?
The bay district has plenty to
offer the grid fan this week-end,
aside from the big affair over at
Berkeley. Tonight the West
Coast Army eleven will tangle
with Santa Clara under the arcs
of the Seals' stadium. The ser
vice squad is reported in good
physical shape, while the Broncs
are handicapped by injuries to
both first-string halfbacks. A
close game is expected.
Jimy Needles will take his
BEARS OR BUMS?

Mud or no mud, however, it
would be nothing short of a miracle
if the crippled Bears should come
through with a victory. They may,
or may not hold the Trojans to a
respectable score. Our guess is that
they will.
Ed Lynch, San Francisco
wrestling impressario, is seek
ing to rematch "Casey" Kazan -
jian, former Stanford athlete,
and "Jumping Joe" Savoldi, ex-
Notre Dame grid star.
The last time the pair met it
proved nothing more than that
they both possessed hard heads.
After each had won a fall they
suddenly dove at each other,
crashing together in mid-air.
That ended festivities for the
evening, as both were knocked
out cold.
He's at it again. That is, Howard
Jones is opening his annual feuds
with rival coaches. Just now, he is
giving vent to his feelings about
Bill Ingrim. The particular excuse
is the strange coincidence that Cali
fornia should have a strong year
ling team following Navy Bill's
summer tour of the state, including
Southern California's weak points.
Wonder what he will dig up to
get mad at "Pop" about the week
before November seventh?
The bay district has plenty to
offer the grid fan this week-end,
aside from the big affair over at
Berkeley. Tonight the West
Coast Army eleven will tangle
with Santa Clara under the arcs
of the Seals' stadium. The ser
vice squad is reported in good
physical shape, while the Broncs
are handicapped by injuries to
both first-string halfbacks. A
close game is expected.
Jimy Needles will take his
BEARS OR BUMS?
With both the varsity and frosh
elevens traveling, the campus will
be without a grid attraction tb's
week-end for the first time this sea
son.
Doubtless many will be lured from
the Farm to Berkeley tomorrow to
see Bill Ingram's proteges prove
themselves Bears or merely bums.
The current rainstorm should
he of real aid to California in
holding the Trojans. Memory
goes back to that scoreless mud
epic of three years ago, when
there wasn't so much as a heavy
dew to account for the moist
condition of the Memorial Sta
dium gridiron.
Meanwhile, the California turf,
non-existent in 1928, is not much
better this year. There is no telling
what a real honesl-to-good:iess
rain will do to it. Mud stopped Wil
liams on that memorable occasion,
and it certainly wouldn't be an aid
to Mohler tomorrow.
