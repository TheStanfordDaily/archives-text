# Trojans Favored To Swamp Golden Bear
## Pinckert, Mohler, Shaver Behind Heavy Veteran Line Expected to Run Riot Tomorrow at U.C. 
### WESTBROOK RUNYON 
MOVING in high gear, what may conceivably he the greatest scoring
machine in Southern California's football history rolls into Memorial
Studium tomorrow afternoon to meet a young hilt scrappy Golden Bear.
With a big, veteran line, the coast's best blocking back in Pinckert, its
most elusive ball-carrier in Mohler, one of its best triple-threatcrs in the
l!)5-pound, speedy Shaver and one of its hardest line-crackers in Musick,
; this mid-season Trojan horde fig-

1 ures to flay the Boar and hang his
! hide upon the line to dry.

j ..The west field that stopped Don
i Williams and the famed Jones cut
! back in 1928 will not play so promi
j nent a part if rain falls tomorrow.
; Southern California's attack is far
I more diversified than it was three
i years ago; insecure footing may
j hamper their wide plays, but will
] make little difference to Musick and
I Shaver.
1 Navy Bill Ingram's charges, in
j spite of their coach's fighting talk,
I are the rankest of outsiders in the
j mythical betting. A green line that

! Washington State will meet the
) West's most powerful running at
j A Blue and Gold offensive that
i is still in the formative stage must
face as fine a forward rank as Troy
ever produced, and the Bears are
minus their one good passer, Hank
I Schaldach. With a back such as Red
j Schefiin of St. Mary's, California's
| chances of victory through the air
j chtmnel weakness which has been
j Troy's since Jones came to coach
them, would be greatly enhanced,
j Southern California has elected to
I stand or fall by the man-to-man
| defense against passes, and 70 per

years can be charged to that weak
j ness.

But California has only Watkins,
who, although he has come with a
I rush in the past two weeks, is not a
Schaldach, or a Schefiin, or a Dusty

: On Watkins, Gill, and Kirwan the
