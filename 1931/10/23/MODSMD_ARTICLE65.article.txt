# TENNIS MEETING CHANGED TO TUESDAY ON ACCOUNT OF RAIN; WILL CUT SQUAD
## 
### 
Due to yesterday's rain, the var- |
sity and freshman tennis meeting I
has been changed to Tuesday after- I
noon from 1:30 to 5:00. All those j
signed up in tennis 35 or 135 must '
report to Coach Sherman Lockwood [
at some time during the afternoon I
on the varsity courts or be automati- ;
cally dropped from the squad.
Coach Lockwood states that the |
purpose of this meeting is to whittle |
the varsity squad down to 20 mem- !
bers instead of the present 50 or GO â– 
now listed on the squad fmd ladder J
combined. This he proposes to do j
by a series of tryouts, which will j
also affect the freshmen, cutting j
their squad down to 15 men.
Following this paring of the I
squads, two special classes will be j
formed for those eliminated from j
the ladder. Whereas these will be !
called tennis 121 and 21, they will be ;
especially fitted to satisfy the needs '
of players of ladder caliber.
Only one match has been settled !
in the novice tournament, which j
resulted in the advancement of j
Piercy ot the second round over
Nelson after a three-set match that |
ran to 4-G, 6-1, 6-4. Coach Elwyn

Bugge urges all entrants not to put
off their matches until the last min
ute, but to get them out of the way
as soon as possible so as to assure
the completion of the first two
rounds by . October 31.
Those in the lower half of their
brackets should get in touch with
the man above them to arrange the
match. If contests are played in the
afternoons, it is requested that the
players use those courts nearest En
cina unless they are enrolled in
classes, in which case they may ob
tain the use of the varsity courts.
The freshmen have straightened
themselves out somewhat for the
year, but the new list posted in the
gym will undoubtedly undergo
many changes before long. The
present rankings place the first ten
men in the following order: Lee,
Lilienthal, Nelson, Dreyer, Zucco,
Moran, Jadarola, Huston, Holt, and
Gran tier.
