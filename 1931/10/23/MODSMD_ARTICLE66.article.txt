# JUNIOR CAGE TEAM WINS FROM SENIOR AND SOPH SQUADS
## 
### 
Coach John Bunn sent his cage !
stars through a still scrimmage last !
night in which the Junior Class |
came to the front by defeating the |
sophomores 17 to 9 and the seniors
21 to 18. Two different squads rep
resented the juniors in the contests. I
The players will hold a final |
scrimmage in the Pavilion this af
ternoon prior to opening the inter- j
class basketball tournament next i
week.
In the contests last night Cordry j
and Palmer starred for the junior I
squad, and Topping was high-scorer j
for the sophomores. Meade, although
shooting rather inaccurately, dis- !
played excellent floor work for the j
seniors.
