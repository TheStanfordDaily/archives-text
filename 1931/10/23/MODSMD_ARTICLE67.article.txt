# CARD SWIMMERS DEFY RAIN, HOLD TIME TRIAL MEET
## 100-Yard Free Style Won By McKelvey; Wiget Places Second 
### 
One activity that was not halted
by yesterday afternoon's rain was
the time trial meet conducted for
varsity and freshman swimmers.
Only three of the five events were
run off by the varsity splashers,
however, whereas the babes went
through with their entire program.
McKelvey took the varsity 100-
yard free-style in the time of 54.H
seconds, with Wiget second and
Gardner third. In the first heat of
the 50-yard free-style event Knapp
finished in 26.6 seconds, Do Silva
and Woods taking second and third,
respectively, but in the second heat
Woods came through in 25.6 time
to win from Raven and Nakayama.
The only other event contested
among the varsity mermen was the
100-yard breast-stroke, in which
Harris and Simons fought between
themselves, to tie at 1:17 flat, fol
lowed by McGavern and McDowell.
Following are the freshman re
sults for all three events, with times
of the winners: 100-yard free-style—
Won by Triola, 59.2; second, Fry;
third, Taranik. 100-yard breast
stroke—Won by Benet, 1:21 fiat;
second, Fitting. 200-yard relay —
Time, 1:49.6; composed of Boothe,
Fry, Fitting, and Triola.
Bill Rogers, promising freshman
backstroke expert, swam against
time to finish the 100-yard back
stroke with the very creditable mark
of 1 minute, 8.6 seconds.
