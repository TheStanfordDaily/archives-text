# LABOR REFUSES AID TO MOONEY BOYCOTT
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Oct. 22 (JP).â€”Mary
land labor has defeated a resolution
calling for a boycott of California
products until Thomas J. Mooney
and Warren K. Billings are released
form the prisons where they are
serving life sentences for the 191(5
Preparedness Day bombings in San
Francisco.
The resolution, rejected by the
Baltimore Federation of Labor last
night, also would have urged Mary
land athletes not to participate in the
coming Olympic games in California.
