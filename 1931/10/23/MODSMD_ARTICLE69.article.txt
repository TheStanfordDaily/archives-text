# SOCCER TEAMS IN TOUGH WEEK END
## Babes Meet Pescadero Hi; Varsity And Spartans Clash Tomorrow 
### 
A hard week-end is in prospect
for the soccer teams of the Farm,
when the freshmen tangle with Pes
cadero High today at 4 o'clock on
the varsity field and the varsity
journeys to San Jose tomorrow to
play the Spartans at 10:30 o'clock.
Under the coaching of George Eb
erhart, the Stanford yearlings have
developed considerably since their
last encounter with Mission High.
Eitner, Sutow, and Emerick form an
excellent nucleus in the forward
line, and have shown marked im
provement in that much stressed at
tackâ€”the short game.
Goal Shots Better
With a radical shake-up in the
varsity's advance line, Harry Ma
loney expects to see a vast differ
ence in the goal shooting ability of
the Indians. The defensive side of
the Cards' game can be expected to
be better than ever.
Having diagnosed his case as due
to "pressing" through over-anxiety,
Maloney shifted Captain Karl Falk
from inside left to the opposite in
side position. The change of play
required has made Falk think more
about the game lie has to play rath
er than the game he ought to play.
IVlearns and Viguie
The work of Stanford's two out
side forwards, Mearns and Viguie,
will be watched with interest, as a
soccer team's attacking power de
pends largely on the ability of the
outsides to set them up for the cen
ter trio to net.
With the return of Hayes to the
right-half position, the first line of
defense is considerably strength
ened. Plumb and Moore can be
depended on to exhibit a good brand
of ball.
Game No Set Up
Although the Indians had little
trouble with the Spartans in their
first encounter winning by a 5-1
margin, the game tomorrow is re
garded as no set-up by Maloney.
Always a tough proposition on their
home field, San Jose will gain con
siderably from the wet weather
which always favors the weaker
team, tending to even things up.
Nobody will be lost from the first
string lineup due to injuries, as Art
Hearn, the only doubtful case, is re
ported to be ready to go.
