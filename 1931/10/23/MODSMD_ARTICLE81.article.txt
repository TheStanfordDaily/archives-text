# POSSIBILITIES FOR LOCAL SECRETARY OF "Y" DISCUSSED
## Pacific Coast Secretary Advises Stanford Christian Ass'n. 
### 
Possibilities for securing a local
secretary for the Stanford Christian
Association werÂ« discussed yester
day noon by David Porter, national i
secretary of the student Y.M.C.A.,
with officials of the local association
after a dinner at the Stanford Union. !
A group of 12 men, from both the
advisory board and the student
cabinet of the local "Y," adjourned
to the "Y" lobby after the dinner. !
Hugh Landram, Pacific Coast secre
tary, told the group that "We are ;
used to the depression among stu
dents, which is constant. But we
can have no real depression where
both officials and students are ?o
interested in the work of Y.M.C.A.
as they have been."
Landram told of a secretary in the ;
South, who, when asked to resign !
because there was no money to pay
him, replied that his work was too
important to leave, and that he
would borrow on his life insurance
until the organization could pay
him.
Members of the advisory board
who attended the meeting were the ,
Rev. Oscar Green, Frank Hoge, Ben
Culver, Morden Brown, and the lo- ;
cal assistant secretary, Richard Sil
verthorn.
The association is without a secre- |
tary this year due to the resigna
tion of their former secretary last '
year.
