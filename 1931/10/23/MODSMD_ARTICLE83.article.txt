# SECOND DEPRESSION DANCE HELD TONIGHT
## 
### 
Depression victims will be favored ,
again tonight at another "ten-cents- |
a" dance given by the Alpha Phi's
at their house.
If you've lost your shekels in the
crash, or even if you haven't, you
are welcome at the depression
dance. If your date docs not want
to put out the pennies to go to the
city, the depression dance is just the
place to go. If you haven't got a <
date come any way and perhaps you
can get one there.
In other words, everyone is in- J
vited, except new women registered
for the first time this quarter, in ]
accordance with the new Pan-Hel
lenic ruling.
