## 
### 
SAN PEDRO, Oct. 22.â€”A $40,000,-
000 steel battleship of the United
States navy was cracked by yeggs.
And, to make it worse, it was Ad
miral Frank H. Schofield's own
flagship that felt the first blow as
the crime wave spread to the navy.
And, still worse, it was the admi
ral's staff funds in the office safe of
the admiral's flagship that the yeggs
took.
