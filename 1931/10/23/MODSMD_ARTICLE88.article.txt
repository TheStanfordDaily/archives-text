## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (IP). — j
Special sales tax on a selected list ■
of luxury articles may be the ad- 1
ministration's way of boosting the !
government's income to the level of !
its expenditures.
This was revealed today almost j
simultaneously with the disclosure j
that progressive and conservative |
leaders in the House are planning to j
seek an upward revision of the 1
tax schedules next session whether
President Hoover likes it or not. j
As soon as the Treasury officials I
announced the sales tax list studied
included matches, radios, automo
biles, and certain articles classified
as luxuries, reaction came from con- I
gressional quarters.
Senator McNary of Oregon, assist- j
ant Republican leader, termed the
proposal as "perfectly ridiculous" ;
and said it was "not the right way
to tax."
