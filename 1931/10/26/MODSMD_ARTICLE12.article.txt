# Trojan "Stewed" Gets Celebrious; Wallet Vanishes
## 
### 
The celebration of his Alma Ma
ter's victory over California resulted
in the loss of his wallet and bewil
derment for Harry E. Games, U.S.C.
student.
In the wee hours of Sunday morn
ing, Games, with a still-unsatiated
taste for celebration, met three men
with apparently the same inclina
tion.
About sunrise his companions sur
reptitiously but gently demanded
that Games pay his share of the
expenses. The student produced $2.
The men demurred and took $11.50.
Games was a bit hazy in his de
scription of the "bandit gang."
"One guy was a great big stiff
about 5 feet 2 inches tall," Games
told police. "No, he wasn't that big.
He v/as about 6 feet 7 inches tall and
weighed about 95 pounds. He was
smooth shaven—or maybe he had a
full beard. The others were all
white men, too —only I think one
was a Jap."
