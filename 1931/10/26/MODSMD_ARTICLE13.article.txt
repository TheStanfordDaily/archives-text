NICOSIA, Island of Cyprus, Oct.
26. (/P) â€”Despite the presence of
military, naval, and air reinforce
ments and arrest of a number of
lingleaders, the island of Cyprus
still was seething with revolt to
night and fresh outbreaks occurred
during the day.
A crowd of 6.000, attending the
funeral of a youth killed in the first
day's rioting last week, attacked
police here in the capital, hurling
stones and shouting maledictions
against their British rulers.
Bluejackets from the cruiser Lon
don, which arrived yesterday, were
fired on at Larnaca by mobs agi
tating for union with Greece and
the sailors retaliated with six shots,
but inflicted no known fatalities.
Several police and rioters were in
jured in other encounters there.
