# PICTURES TO BE TAKEN FOR QUAD OF A-B SENIORS
## 
### 
Seniors whose last names be
gin with "A" or "B" will be
photographed for the 1932
Quad today at the Watson
Studios across the street from
the Press Building between the
hours 9 to 12 o'clock and 1 to 5
o'clock.
As business arrangements
prevent a later re-taking of
seniors, those listed for today
are advised to be sure to re
port today. Men are requested
to wear coats and neckties for
the picture, and all are asked
to bring their Quad receipts
with them when they appear
at the studio. Â»
