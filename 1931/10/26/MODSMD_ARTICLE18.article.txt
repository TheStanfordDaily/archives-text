i\o rooters ucKets are to go on
sale—but Glenn Scobcy "Pop" War
ner's art exhibit promises to turn
the Stanford art gallery into a young
stadium.
While most of Stanford wends its
way home from the south Sunday
after the U.S.C. game, the doors of
the art gallery are to be thrown
open upon a display of all-coach art
—the peaceful Palo Alto landscapes
of Coach Pop Warner—pastels of the
northern woods by Coach Bob
Zuppke of Illinois—and two or three
paintings by William "Lone Star"
Dietz, coach at Haskell Institute.
One example of artistic teamwork
by Warner and Dietz will be on
view. It seems that "Pop" and Dietz
took canvas and palette and went
out for spring practice on the Stan
lord campus one afternoon. Both

nappenea to tackle a tree, but with
different ideas. Dietz said it should
be one way, "Pop" another. A ver
bal scrimmage ended in Dietz shift
ing around right end to paint the
landscape, while "Pop" carried on
down the field with the tree.
Zuppke's oils and watercolor im
pressions of the northern woods ob
serve the same daring and dash that
marks His football teams. Warner's
paintings, in peaceful California
style, show subdued coloring, with
an occasional flash of tint.
The exhibit will remain to strike
an artistic note in the final trumpet
ry of football season. Beginning
November 8, the pictures will be on
display over Big Game day and until
the Indians leave for Dartmouth at
the end of the month. The exhibits
will close December 1.
