# "PEP" RALLY TO GREET VARSITY AT S. P. DEPOT
## Lunch Postponed So That All Students May Welcome Team 
### 
| An all-University rally to wel- '
| come Pop Warner and his gridders
back to the Farm will be staged at j
noon today at the Southern Pa- 1
cific depot.
All eating organizations on the
I campus have agreed to postpone
I luncheon till 12:30 o'clock, so that
everyone can be at the station to !
; meet the team, which will afrive on
I the 12:04 train.
j "We realize that it will be more
diflicult for the students to have to
| go to Palo Alto instead of having the
rally on campus," said Ed Boyles,
; chairman of the Rally Committee,
! "but it is the best psychological
move, since we did not win, to meet
the boys at the train.
Hard Conditions
"In the rain at Seattle Saturday, i
Stanford went up against conditions
diametrically opposed to her type of
play, and we want to show the men
I that we think they are playing bet
! ter than they have been in the last j
; three years. We can do a lot toward
j keeping the morale of the team on
; a high level if we make a demon
-1 stration for them at the station
' today.
"We must back the team to the
limit now, at the tough end of our
schedule, with U.S.C., Cal and Dart
mouth coming up. Those three 1
games are the ones which will make
or break Stanford's 1931 football
standing."
Encouragement
The rally, Boyles declared, should
be in the nature of "that hearty slap
i on the back which one Stanford man
gives another, and which says, 'Old
| boy, you did your best but the cards
fell the wrong way.' "
Students with cars are requested
i to drive past the English corner of
j the quad after their 11 o'clock
j classes, to pick up those without
: transportation and get them to the
j station in time for the rally.
