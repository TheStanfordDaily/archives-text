The Indian squad will return
(o the campus today to settle
down to the serious business of
working up to that November 7
peak. A not weak U.C.L.A.
eleven remains to be hurdled
this week, but should be dis
posed of without great difficulty.
With their offense reduced to im
potency by a driving rainstorm, Ihe
Indians did not do a bad job in
holding ofi a Husky pack pointed
> for a game they had to win, but one
which Stanford took more or less in
| stride.
Phclan Makes Showing
Jimmy Phelan, after losing to
Oregon, had to make a showing
; against Stanford to stave off the
i anvil chorus. He did make a show
ing. Ilis Huskies drove the Indians
deep in their own territory in the
first quarter, keeping them there
; for the entire period.
Only once in that initial quarter
did Stanford carry the ball past its
| own 30-yard line, and registered
i only one first down. Washington
I made three first downs and was a
j constant threat. Once, held for three
j downs on the 15-yard line, the Hus
! kics attempted a place kick which,
! 'f good, would have won the game.
The second quarter saw the In-r
; dians work themselves out of iho
hole. Washington made three more
i first downs, but failed again to pierce
; the Stanford 30-yard line after los
j ing the ball on downs on the 25-
j yard line at the start of the period.
I The half ended with the ball in
i mid-field after Corbus had re
| covered one Husky fumble and par
-1 tially blocked a punt.
Sccond Half Even
The second half was about as oven
, as a ball game can be. Both team:;
; threatened to score in the third
I quarter. A long run-back of Hand's
kickofT and a blocked punt quickly
•swept Washington to Stanford's 35-
j yard line. HufTord reeled off six
j yards to the 9-yard line, but after
I one play was held, the Huskies
! passed incomplete over the goal line.
Stanford look possession on (he
; 20-yard stripe, and the Washington
j attack was through for the day.
; Moffatt kicked on third down to
1 Hufford, who returned nine yards
to his own 49. Allen grabbed Wol
cott's pass on Stanford's 32, being
downed on the 36. Here Stanford
i launched a power attack which took
; them to the Washington 10-yard
line before it was stopped.
Dropping deception in favor
of straight power, the Big Red
j Machine set out for an nppar-
ent score. Hillman, Allen, and
Afflerbaugh, aided by one pass
from Allen to MolYatt, marched
with short, steady punches to
the 14-yard line in four first
downs.
The desperate Huskies then stif
fened, and three plays flung at the
line netted but four yards. On fourth
down Cherberg intercepted Allen's
short pass to stop Stanford's lone i
scoring threat. Hufford kicked out ;
of danger as the quarter ended.
Punting Duel
Rain poured down throughout the i
final period and the game resolved
into a punting duel between Huf
ford of Washington and Moffatt, Af
flerbaugh, and Campbell for Star.- !
fBrd.
For the most part both teams
played safe, punting on third down.
Once Hufford returned Campbell's
punt past mid-field,, but after one
6-yard thrust, Washington was held
and punted to Stanford's 8-yard
line.
Danger there, with a sodden
hall to handle. Two running
plays netted a couple of yards,
and Afflerbaugh kicked. He got
away a beauty and drove the
Huskies hack to their own 35.
One more exchange of punts and
the game was over.
Statistics show little advantage to j
either team in any department, de
spite the failure of the Indian of
fense. Stanford would undoubtedly
have won on the local field. Warner ,
declared before leaving for the
North that .Stanford would have
to be three touchdowns better than
the Huskies in order to play them ,
on even terms on their own gridiron. I
Stanford gained 104 yards from ;
scrimmage to 82 by Washington,
while the latter netted 37 yards
from passes to 6 by Stanford. Wash- i
ington punts averaged 38V2 yards,
three better than Stanford's.

to his own 49. Allen grabbed Wol
cott's pass on Stanford's 32, being
downed on the 36. Here Stanford
i launched a power attack which took
; them to the Washington 10-yard
line before it was stopped.
Dropping deception in favor
of straight power, the Big Red
j Machine set out for an nppar-
ent score. Hillman, Allen, and
Afflerbaugh, aided by one pass
from Allen to MolYatt, marched
with short, steady punches to
the 14-yard line in four first
downs.
The desperate Huskies then stif
fened, and three plays flung at the
line netted but four yards. On fourth
down Cherberg intercepted Allen's
short pass to stop Stanford's lone i
scoring threat. Hufford kicked out ;
of danger as the quarter ended.
Punting Duel
Rain poured down throughout the i
final period and the game resolved
into a punting duel between Huf
ford of Washington and Moffatt, Af
flerbaugh, and Campbell for Star.- !
fBrd.
For the most part both teams
played safe, punting on third down.
Once Hufford returned Campbell's
punt past mid-field,, but after one
6-yard thrust, Washington was held
and punted to Stanford's 8-yard
line.
Danger there, with a sodden
hall to handle. Two running
plays netted a couple of yards,
and Afflerbaugh kicked. He got
away a beauty and drove the
Huskies hack to their own 35.
One more exchange of punts and
the game was over.
Statistics show little advantage to j
either team in any department, de
spite the failure of the Indian of
fense. Stanford would undoubtedly
have won on the local field. Warner ,
declared before leaving for the
North that .Stanford would have
to be three touchdowns better than
the Huskies in order to play them ,
on even terms on their own gridiron. I
Stanford gained 104 yards from ;
scrimmage to 82 by Washington,
while the latter netted 37 yards
from passes to 6 by Stanford. Wash- i
ington punts averaged 38V2 yards,
three better than Stanford's.

one thing—a careful building process on the part of "Pop" Warner toward
that November day, now less than two weeks oIT, when the Indians, at a
peak, should present MAXIMUM power for the first time against the
Terrible Trojans.
Stanford 0, Washington 0. They both IIA1) to win, and neither did. They
even speak of a Husky "moral" victory. BUT the Old Man. according
to press dispatches, is PLEASED. About what? Because Stanford's de
fense looked better than at any time before this season. Because of the
performances of the ends and tackles, focal points of the Southern Cali
fornia attack. If Stanford holds the Howard Jones eleven at Los Angeles
on November 7, it will be because of Tod, Colvin, Ehrhorn, and Hand.
