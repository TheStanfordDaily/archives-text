# RALLY ROUND, MEN!
## 
### 
Al 12: 01 o'clock today Stanford's grid squad returns to
the campus, not as conquerors, but still undefeated. Kvery
student should be at the train to meet the team that fought
a hard battle on a muddv field with a slippery ball, handi
caps, though equal for bj>th teams, which made a scoring
offense impossible.
The toughest games are yet to come and the gridsters
need the support of the student body if they expect to come
out on the long end of the scores for the remainder of the
season.
Let's all be at the station and give the Indian warriors
the rousing welcome that they deserve!
