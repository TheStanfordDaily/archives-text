For all the ribbing that Princeton, Yale and Harvard
come in for at the hands of those who consider them con
descendingly superior, their athletic contests remain the
traditional big games of the East, whatever the caliber of
their respective teams may be. Princeton and Harvard
have severed relations, it is true, but the Princeton-Yale
and Harvard-Yale football games are always sell-outs.
Therefore it is with regret that the Daily observes an
editorial in the New York University Daily News suggest
ing that Rutgers, for years the Violet's traditional rival, be
given an earlier date in coming football schedules because
Rutgers is no longer considered a worthy opponent for
N.Y.U.
Under the coaching of Chick Meehan, N.Y.U. has gone
forward rapidly in a football way. Rutgers has not, and
so Rutgers must make way for an opponent that will give
N.Y.U. a battle and attract more customers to the gate.
There can be no explanation for such a proposed action,
other than commercialism. Princeton has been taking lick
ings regularly from Yale these past few years, and Harvard
has been dropping Yale quite frequently; Columbia de
feated Dartmouth for the tirst time in .'{l years two weeks
ago, yet there is no talk of "set-up" in those rivalries of
half a century.
Tradition is in reality the backbone of college athletics.
To sacrifice it for dollars is robbing the game of its finest
attribute.
