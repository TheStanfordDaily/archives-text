# ANOTHER BIG WIN
## 
### 
Striving for ground lost when they relinquished the
right to smoke when and where they please, Stanford's
Five Hundred has won a great moral victoryâ€”the privilege
to veil as rooters at football games.
Until this, year, incoming freshman women have been
advised that rooting for the team in the accepted manner
was conduct unbecoming to a Stanford woman. This year,
however, somebody has awakened to the realization that
the Stanford woman might very well be a flesh-and-blood
human being instead of a stuffed shirt (or is it blouse?).
At all events, Coach Warner's charges will come up to
tlie line of scrimmage with the hitherto forbidden feminine
shrieks sounding in their ears. Onward, Five Hundred!
