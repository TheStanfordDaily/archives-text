# THE 						GOVERNMENT COMES THROUGH

It's a long lane that lias no turning, and Scarface Ai
Capone has apparently run bis course. Barring the possi
bility of an appeal being granted, the man whose name has
been synonymous with gangland and outlawry is scheduled
to spend the next 11 years of bis life in a federal peniten
tiary for lax evasions.
The Daily is in no position to judge, but lo the casual
observer it would seem that the federal government could
make no more powerful move against organized gangsters
than to jail Capone, who has openly sneered at the law for
these many years. The knowledge that even the biggest
shot in the entire crooked racket cannot cross the federal
govrnment may put a crimp in the aspirations and activi
ties of others like Scarface AI.
