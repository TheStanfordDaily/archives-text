# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Some European visitor to our
shores must have remarked in an
interview that he considered Amer
ica the land of contraditions; and
even if he didn't, it is true, none
theless. The world was amused and
somewhat shocked several years ago
when our esteemed Senate passed
and our equally esteemed President
Coolidge endorsed the Kellogg
Peace Pact for the outlawry of war
and a bill providing for 15 naw
battle cruisers within a few days of
each other. Time has proven that
there was no essential contradiction
in their action, but at the time, it
did look slightly queer, to say the
least.
More recently a similar contradic
tion has taken place—not so official,
not so startling, not so sudden, but
equally amusing. The Woman's In
ternational League for Peace and
Freedom, through Jane Addams ind
a daughter of the late President
Taft, presented to the President a
huge petition, with signatures from
throughout the nation, urging peace
and all that sort of thing. And just
the other day the nation celebrated
the battle of Yorktown—amid cos
tumed soldiers, the booming of an
cient cannon, and "we-won-the-bat
tle" speeches. Let it be said to
Hoover's credit that even though
he came to commemorate the defeat
of Great Britain, he so sugar-coated
the whole affair that it almost
seemed like a victory for the Brit
ish. In the interests of world-under
standing, he sacrificed a wonderful
opportunity for an America First,
Last, and Always speech.

PEACE PETITIONS AND YORKTOWN

Nevertheless, the populace had to
be satisfied; and all reports seem to
indicate that a grand and glorious
spectacle was put on. It goes with
out saying that the majority of the
citizenry were more thrilled by the
pageant at Yorktown than by the
peace petition presented at the
White House. It is only natural that
they should be.
What is more interesting, two
elderly women handing over several
sheaves of paper to the President
or hundreds of uniformed men
marching here and there to rapid
military marches? The world is so
constituted today that the memory
of a national victory—even though
more than 50 per cent of the credit
belongs to a foreign power—is more
exciting than hopes of a world
brotherhood.
Very few deny that peace would
be a wonderful thing. Very few
should deny that it is a long way
off. The slower and yet only way
to finally realize peace is to re-con
dition the emotional background cf
the people. We must learn to thrill
to other anthems besides our own.
The glory of peace must be made
as exciting as the glory of war.
Peace organizations must use bally
hoo, glamour, and every means of
emotional propaganda within their
means to realize their aims. The in
tellectual cream may come to be
lieve in and work for peace by
means of mental processes. The
general populace will only become
peace-minded through the psycho
logically lower, but practically
higher, medium of emotion.
