This journalistic entity of which
we are but a small part now boasts
a voice of the people section, a col
lection of editorials and two or three
columns, but we are all for intro
ducing a "Twenty-five Years Ago
Today" colyum. Undoubtedly the
Daily of the future will have one,
running something like this.
Twenty-five Years Ago Today
Construction of the new gates at
the entrance of the campus are rap
idly nearing completion, the admin
istration said today.
Ten Years Ago Today
Stanford's new campus gates, fin
ishing touches of which are now
being made, will be finished very
soon, the Comptroller said today.
Five Years Ago Today
According to a statement made
today, Stanford's new campus gates
will be finished in time for the Big
Game next month.
The foregoing column can then be

placed next to the day's editorial
commenting on the fact that the
new gates are nearin gcompletion.
But why not put a few more
gates aroun eland solve tho un
employment situation for the
next two generations?
We trailed the Chappie's staff
punster down to the airport the
other day, and overheard him mut
tering the following as he inspected
an airplane:
"So this is your plane, huh? Why
don't you get a helipoctex - . I saw a
keen babe the other night so heli
copter'. Ha, ha! She's much fatter
than most people; there's fuselage.
Wheee! And this is the aileron. You
know, the first thing to do when
you want to hang a picture is
if there's na aileron. Ho, ho! What's
this, the altimeter? You know, the
other night I couldn't meet my dame

but my roommate A1 wasn't busy so
I sent altimeter. But my other buddy
Axel sure can rate the babes. If I
can't land one I send Axel around.
Accelerator. Whoopee! What? You
say everything else is thingamajig
or a gadget? Well, as the Irish
dancer said of his tapping, that's
the main thingamajig. Do you gad
get? Now show me the choke. Hey!
No! Stop it! Ark—glub—glu—"
