THE LIGHT THAT NEVER WAS—

By Katharine Fullerton Gerould.
New York. Charles Scribner's
Sons. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)

The girl leaves the small town in
search of "the light that never was
by sea or land," which intangible
quantity seems to be too sacred for
Mrs. Gerould to define, but we
would guess that she means ro
mance. She, the girl, goes to New
York and goes to a show while she
is there. When she looks into the
eyes of the man beside her at the
show she sees "the light that never
was." But she already is provided
with a fiance and so—lo, the triangle.
Question, does the lighted one lose
or win?
For the rest, this book is an ex
ample of Mrs. Gerould's best senti
mental manner. —E.T.P.

ALEXANDER HAMILTON—At the

New Stanford Theatre.
As a portrayer of historical parts
George Arliss has achieved a dis
tinct niche for himself in filmdom's
hall of fame. Actually, instead of
putting on the character of the pcfr
son he is portraying, he to
nifuse that character inlo his own,
so that we see Disraeli, Alexander
Hamilton, and "the millionaire,", all
playing the part of George Arliss.
Very agreeable, too, his perfect dic
tion, the vibrance of his voice, and
the apparent magnetism of his pres
ence which makes any part inter
esting.
The costuming and make-up of
the entire cast is unusually artistic.
No secondary character can hope to
appear outstandingly brilliant if di
rectly contrasted with Arliss; but
the work of all of those lesser lights
is decidedly above average. The plot
is sufficiently accurate, as historical
plays go, and the complete absence
of painfully strained emotionalism
is especially commendable.

RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE

—At the Varsity Theatre.
In faith and begorra, another Wild
West thriller—but it is a good one
this time!
Marguerite Churchill and George

O'Brien do some excellent acting.
They are convincingly uncouth, yet i
they retain enough Hollywood
sophistication to make them poised
and gracious as well. Ditto, Noah
Beery as the villain. The little girl !
who says "awight" and "ver good"
so nicely is the best juvenile we
have seen in a long time.
We found it refreshing to have '
people with savoir faire in a West
ern setting. Even though it is not ;
true to tradition to find such people i
in the Arizona of 1871 it must have j
been true to life at least once or '
twice.
This is a fast-moving picture.
There is a great deal of riding, chas- j
ing, and general blood-and-thunder. |
Even this does not spoil the show
although often one cannot tell ihe !
hero from the villain for the dust.
