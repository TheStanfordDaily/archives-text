It locks like a great Big Game.
While many were looking for
California to hold the Trojans to a
respectable score Saturday, that in
spired stand which allowed but a
single touchdown was nothing less
than astonishing, to say nothing cf
the Bears' own scoring threats.
Yes, it looks like there is going
<o be SOME Big Game this year,
but that Golden Bear has a lot
to learn yet. Southern Califor
nia's lone score came on a typi
cal "Pop" Warner reverse, when
Sparling scampered across the
goal from the 15-yard line.
EVERY time the Trojan machine
resorted to revei'ses, they worked.
All of which would seem to indi
cate something or other.

"Not a GREAT team, but we have
Ihe foundation of a good ball club."
So said "Pop" Warner at the
start of the season, and so it
has proved. Lacking "greatness,"
the Indians have twice been
tied, by the Olympic Club
and by Washington. Possessing
"g ootl n e s s," Stanford has
reached mid-season undefeated,
and with a goal line which has
been crossed but once.
Taking every game in stride, the
Indians have turned back many
teams obviously pointed for them,
particularly Minnesota, Oregon
State, and Washington.
J i:st HOW good the Stanford team
is, however, will not be known un
til the afternoon of November 7,
when Warner will bring his charges
to a peak for the first time.

Reports from the South indicate
that U.C.L.A. will attempt to pull a
"Santa Clara" this week. That is,
Ihey hope to sneak up on Stanford
Saturday and put over an upset, as
the Broncos have done more than
once.
The Bruins have shown fair <
strength this season, reaching a
peak Saturday in a 46 to 0 win
over little Pomona. While the
Indians will of course be con
centrating on the Trojan game,
they cannot altogether overlook
the Bruins.
Meanwhile Southern California
will today start preparations for the
Stanford game, unworried by so
much as a "breather" this Saturday.
