# GORDAN OPTIMISTIC OVER WEEK'S POLO PRACTICE RESULTS
## 
### 
After casting a critical eye over
the polo squad during the first week
of actual practice, Captain Richard
A. Gordan feels optimistic over the
season's results. For this early in
the season, Captain Gordan thinks
that the outfit looks "very good," al
though somewhat ragged, of course.
It is highly probable that Peter
Lewis will hold down the number
two position on the squad, with
Captain Bruce Fleming in number
four place. The number one and
three berths are uncertain as yet,
with very keep competition raging.
Holt, Spalding, and Lupen are the
main contenders for number (one,
and Gillham, Melono, and Stevick
are fighting it out for number three.
Due to the persistent rain, scrim
mage is bound to be slowed upâ€”so
much, in fact, that Friday's gamo
with the Menlo Circus Club will
have to be postponed a week.
