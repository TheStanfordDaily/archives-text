# SAN JOSE JAYSEE SOCCERMEN HOLD CARDS TO 2-1 WIN
## Stanford Freshmen Beaten 2-0 By Pescadero High Team 
### 
Suffering from a bad case of ovrr
confidence, the Indian soccer varsity
was just able to squeeze out a 2-1
win from the San Jose Spartans on
the latter's home field on Saturday,
while the yearlings of the Farm look
a defeat from Pescadero High on
Friday, 2-0.
Scoring both their goals in the
I first half, the Cards let down in
j the second stanza and were unable
! to add to their meager total. The
| Spartan goal came late in the sec
! ond period after a prolonged attack
! on the Redshirts.
Miraculous Saves
Even though the San Jose goalie
was making miraculous saves dur
j ing the first half to keep the scor -•
! down to two markers, the Stanford
forward line cannot be excused for
missing easy chances to net the ball.
Once again the halves and lulls
played a Nine brand of soccer for
Maloney. Moore, Card center h.Uf,
who seems to have recovered pretty
| much from his rib injury, played nis
! usual aggressive game.
Yearlings Improved
Showing a tremendous improve-
I ment over last week, the Card babes
I held a powerful Pescadero High
j outfit to a 2-0 win. Added to Ken
j nedy's steady play was the work of
j a newcomer to the yearling ranks —
White —who played right half and
gave promise of developing into
varsity material.
| The freshman goal was well taken
! care of by Brownton, who was
greatly responsible for keeping the
scoi'e down, by several splendid
stops, and by his able directing of
the fullbacks.
Like the varsity, the freshmen are
unable to develop a smooth-working
forward wall with a goal-scoring
punch. Time and again the babes
! would work the ball down into op
| posing territory and then be unable
i to net the oval.
