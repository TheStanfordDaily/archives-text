# Trobabes Tear Up Card Defense, 26-0
## Warburton Stars for Southern Boys, Pushing Over Two of Four Touchdowns; Makes 82-Yard Run 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
DIPPING through (he Stanford line for long gains that culminated in
j four touchdowns, the U.S.C. Trobabes blasted their way to a26to 0
victory over (he Stanford freshman eleven Saturday. The 140-pound quar
terback flash, Warburton, proved to he the thorn in the Cardinals' skins.
He alone accounted for a pair of the Southern team's scores. His first
effort was a stunning 82-yard run at the close of the first quarter, when
he twisted and spun his meteoric path through the entire team, of Indians.
Later on in the second quarter Warburton sneaked 17 yards by the line
of scrimmage to the 5-yard line before he was pulled down. On the next

play lu* drove over the remaining
distance for his second score of the
day.
All hopes of the Cardinal year
lings for a second-half rally were
dispelled when Clemens dashed 55
yards through a broken field for the
third U.S.C. touchdown. In the last
quarter S.C. put on their only sus
tained power drive of the afternoon,
a 52-yard march from inside their
own half of the field that ended
when Flourney ploughed over from
the 10-yard line on a reverse.
The Southern team had the Stan
ford plays stopped cold and the ln
' dians never got away for any
' threatening advances. Flannaganand
| Seaver of the Cards were outstand
\ ing on defensive play.
Spectators who arrived early at
the California-Trojan affair in tho
! Memorial Stadium and had an op
| portunity to view the latter part of
the California freshman slaughter
i of Bakersfield J.C. were plentifully
impressed by the size and number
of good U.C. players. There should
be no more moaning about the pau
city of material at California when
these men are on the varsity, be
; cause they are all big and cxperi
j enced.
Five teams were used and each
! looked more impressive than its pre
| decessor. Nothing but straight foot
ball was attempted but even the
i simplest of plays worked for gains.
I Bakersfield defeated the Stanford
I frosh, 16 to 0, and lost to California
49 to 0. U.S.C. beat Stanford 26 to 0,
' and lost to California 23 to 0. It's
I going to be a great Little Big Game
| this year, boys!
