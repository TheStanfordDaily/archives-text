# 'BERKELEY SQUARE' REQUIRES SPECIAL CREW OF WORKERS
## English Home Duplicated With Minute Care; Lane Does Portrait 
### 
Settings for Balderston s fascinat
ing comedy, "Berkeley Square,"
which will be given on Friday night,
October 30, are requiring a special
crew of workers to arrange scenes
and sound elTects.
The entire staging is in the morn
ing room of an English home. This
house of the eighteenth century is
built along the classic lines of
Queen Anne style. Special care has
been taken to make sure of the ac
curacy of all the furnishings used
in this high-ceiled, wood-panelled
room.
The play has presented the prob
lem of seeking several interesting
properties, among them a Crux An
sata, the symbolic figure of im
mortal life belonging to early
Egyptian dynasties. For use in
scenes, Frederick Stover, technical
director, is having reproductions
made copying Wedgewood china.
Of particular distinction is a pic
ture of Peter Standish after Gains
borough. Josephine Lane has been
chosen to execute this work. "Mrs.
Bumpstead Leigh" called for three
of her portraits, two after Reynolds
and one after Gainsborough. An
other of her pictures attracted much
notice in "Wings Over Europe.
Lane paints from primary sketches
made by Frederick Stover, doing all
her work on burlap, a material re
markably suited for stage purposes.
Rehearsal for the remaining week
will be held with all scenes in their
exact order, Harold Helvenston an
nounced. Members of the cast are
requested to be at the Assembly
Hall at 7 o'clock and late rehearsal
will be held only on Wednesday and
Thursday nights.
