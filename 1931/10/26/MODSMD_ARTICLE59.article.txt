# "GROWING BELIEF IN GOD," SERMON THEME
## 
### 
That Science has done much to
prove that there is a God was the
opinion expressed by Dr. David
Charles Gardner, University chap
lain, in his sermon yesterday morn
ing in the Memorial Church. He
said, in part, that as the scientists
probe into the secrets of the earth
they are more and more struck by
the fact that there is some domi
nant mind and will behind the
world's creation.
Dr. Gardner believes that through
out the world there is a spirit of
kindliness and love which the
teachings of God have inspired, and
that, explorers and soldiers of- for
tune have found this spirit of God
in people at the very ends of the
earth.
