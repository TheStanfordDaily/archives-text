TOKIO, Oct. 25 (/P).—Japan has
I no idea of acceding to the League of
| Nations Council's resolution calling
, upon her to withdraw troops from
; occupied Manchuriart territory by
j November 16, government circles
i made clear today, unless China be
forehand offers guarantees of pro
tection for Japanese lives and prop
erty.
j This, one of the five fundamental
! principles upon which Japan has
I said she would negotiate for a
! peaceful settlement of the Manchu
! rian disturbance, was stated simul
j taneously with assurances that To-
J kio would endeavor to persuade
) China to enter into direct conversa
j tions. Direct negotiation, it was said,
I probably would in time lead to the
' beginning of troop withdrawals
I should local Chinese authorities be
| able to assume responsibility for
j proper policing of the districts.
