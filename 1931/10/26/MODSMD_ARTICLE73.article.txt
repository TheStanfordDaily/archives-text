## 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky, Oct. 25 (/P).â€”
Ruth Nichols, Rye, N.Y., aviatrix
who left Oakland, Cal., last night
on a projected nonstop flight to New
York, landed at Bowman Field here
at 7:40 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time)
today. Officials at the airport said
she evidently had lost her way.
Although some distance from the
end of her flight, the aviatrix appar
ently had achieved her goal, a new
distance record for women of 2000
although the sealed instru
ments on the plane had not been ex
amined. The present women's dis
tance rceord of 1810 miles is held by
Maryse Bastie, Frenchwoman.
