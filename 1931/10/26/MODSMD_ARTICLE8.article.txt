# FIRST PICTURES TAKEN FOR QUAD
## "A" And "B" Seniors Will Be Photographed Today 
### 
Stanford's annual round of indi
vidual photography starts today for
a new Quad, the 1932 edition, when
seniors whose last names start with
"A" or "B" will don coats and neck
ties, fall outfits and make-up to be
ushered .in at the new campus stu
dio across the street from the Press
Building.
The senior list will start at the be
ginning of the alphabet and work
through to the end, according to
Quad officials, alloting certain indi
viduals to cei'tain days. It is hoped
that the senior and Roble sections
as well as part of the living groups
will be completed this fall.
The studio is located in the build
ing formerly used as offices for the
Department of Physical Education
for Women and situated across the
street from the Daily office and the
Press Building. Office hours will be
from 9 to 12 o'clock and 1 to 5 o'-
clock.
The Quad staff iidvises that the
morning hours afford faster service,
while the greatest congestion occurs
between 1 and 2 o'clock in the after
noon. The John Watson Studios of
Berkeley are handling the work,
Mrs. Watson herself doing the pho
tography.
A new system of proof display
will be used this fall. Instead of
taking four hurried poses and print
ing four cheap red proofs for the
seniors to choose from, more time
will be taken to insure two good
poses which will be printed as black
and white proofs already retouched
to give the student a better idea of
what the finished picture will be.
The Quad staff stresses the point
that business arrangements prevent
over-solicitation of senior appoint
ments; hence seniors are advised to
report for their pictures on their
specified days. Seniors are re
quested to bring their Quad receipt
to the studio.
