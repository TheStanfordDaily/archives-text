# CAPITOL VIEWS LAVAL ACCORD WITH ASKANCE
## Officials Of Administration Express Satisfaction With Decision CONFERENCE AWAITED Arms Reduction Essential To New Debt Pact 
### 
•WASHINGTON, Oct. 26. (/P) — A
somewhat skeptical Congress stood
questioningly today over the cradle
of the newborn Hoover-Laval eco
nomic accord.
While Administration officials re
iterated their satisfaction, the Con
gressional leaders received with
mingled feelings the news that a
war debt-reparations adjustment ia
in the offing.
Meanwhile word came from Ber
lin of intentions of Chancellor
Bruenlng to re-open the reparation
question soon in response to the
Hoover-Laval hint.
On this and perhaps 011 some of
the other points discussed in his
conferences with Premier Laval of
France, President Hoover still has
to convince the legislative branch
of the government which passes on
the debt agreements.
The upshot of the day of reaction
at the Capitol seemed to be that
the skeptical members of Congress
were going to wait and see what
was necessary when the time came.
More than one pointed to the Gen
eva Disarmament Conference to be
held next February. The inference
was that it is up to Europe—what
ever may be the understanding of"
the President and M. Laval on dis
armament—to show some serious
determination to cut down on arms
before asking for a reduction in
debt burdens.
