## Sigma Chis, Theta Delts Incur Injuries 
### 
A dislocated shoulder, a thor
oughly smashed-in nose, a split
head—in this wise did the gods of
touch football take their toll from
the Sigma Chis and the Theta Dells
: in yesterday's game, one of the four
' played on the first day of the in
, tramural schedule.
It all happened in one play, and
| when the smoke had cleared away,
I Sigma Chi stood triumphant with
! two points to its credit. Wilson and
Evans, Theta Delt players, hurt
head and nose, respectively, when
I they collided while chasing the ball
! following a punt. Saunders, of
Sigma Chi, then hurled himself into
i the breach, forcing a safety and
throwing his shoulder out at the
I same time.
The remainder of the game, won
by Sigma Chi, 15 to 0, was played
in Theta Delt territory until the
last four minutes, when the Theta
' Delts were held for four downs on
the five-yard line. Palmer starred
for the winners, doing all the run
ning and passing, while Wheeler
and Hill looked good on the re
; ceiving end. Jensen played an ex
| cellent game for the losers, snaring
1 several difficult passes for substan
| tial gains.
