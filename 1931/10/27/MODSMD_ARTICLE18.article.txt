# Mural Football Rough Game, 3 Players Learn
## Sigma Chis, Theta Delts Incur Injuries 
### 
A dislocated shoulder, a thor
oughly smashed-in nose, a split
head—in this wise did the gods of
touch football take their toll from
the Sigma Chis and the Theta Dells
: in yesterday's game, one of the four
' played on the first day of the in
, tramural schedule.
It all happened in one play, and
| when the smoke had cleared away,
I Sigma Chi stood triumphant with
! two points to its credit. Wilson and
Evans, Theta Delt players, hurt
head and nose, respectively, when
I they collided while chasing the ball
! following a punt. Saunders, of
Sigma Chi, then hurled himself into
i the breach, forcing a safety and
throwing his shoulder out at the
I same time.
The remainder of the game, won
by Sigma Chi, 15 to 0, was played
in Theta Delt territory until the
last four minutes, when the Theta
' Delts were held for four downs on
the five-yard line. Palmer starred
for the winners, doing all the run
ning and passing, while Wheeler
and Hill looked good on the re
; ceiving end. Jensen played an ex
| cellent game for the losers, snaring
1 several difficult passes for substan
| tial gains.
Plii Delts Win
Phi Delta Phi, honorary law fra
; ternity, took the A.K.L.'s into camp
j to the tune of 21 to 0. The winners
! were heavier, faster, and showed :t
I great deal more experience in or
: ganized team play. Their passing
! game was working in fine shape,
i Intercepted passes accounted for two
of the three touchdowns, all of
i which were scored comparatively
j early in the game. The A.K.L.'s
j played a fairly good defensive game,
which improved noticeably in the
j second half. Weston and Grant
' starred for the winners, while
! Thorup and Kutche did good work
| for A.K.L.
The Phi Delts overwhelmed El
| Capitan 21-0 in a game that was
played in the club territory except
for a very short time at the end of
the second half. Jenkins' passes
were little short of phenomenal,
finding their marks in the arms of
Saufley or McGuire time and time
again. Three times they resulted in
touchdowns, once in the first half
| and twice in the second. One pass
to Saufley was at least 45 yards.
Stump and Karmel made a good
showing for Capitan.
Chi Psi Victory
Chi Psi had no trouble with El
' Campo, coming out at the good end
j of a 20-0 score. All -the scores —
three touchdowns and a safety—
were made in the first half. The last
j half was played in mid-field. Peck-
I ham's passes to Mcßright, and the
fast interference furnished by Wash
i burn and Little featured the Chi
i Psi play. Talley and Holt played
j well for the clubmcn, the latter in
, tercepting four passes.

A dislocated shoulder, a thor

touch football take their toll from
the Sigma Chis and the Theta Dells
: in yesterday's game, one of the four
' played on the first day of the in

It all happened in one play, and

I Sigma Chi stood triumphant with

Evans, Theta Delt players, hurt
head and nose, respectively, when
I they collided while chasing the ball
! following a punt. Saunders, of
Sigma Chi, then hurled himself into
i the breach, forcing a safety and
throwing his shoulder out at the
I same time.
The remainder of the game, won
by Sigma Chi, 15 to 0, was played
in Theta Delt territory until the
last four minutes, when the Theta
' Delts were held for four downs on
the five-yard line. Palmer starred
for the winners, doing all the run
