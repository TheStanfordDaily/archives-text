# Washington Injury May Keep Moffatt From Reaching Peak
## Gribbin Returns to Hospital with Renewal of Injury; Heiser Has Game Leg; Complete Secrecy Surrounds Practice Sessions 
### JACK JERNEGAN 
piIIL MOFFATT may not reach his full effectiveness again this season;
j Red (jrihhin is back in the hospital with a renewal of his former leg
injury; Pete Heiser is in the hospital with a knee injury; and Pop Warner
has settled down to work in earnest for the crucial game with U.S.C.
Such are the developments in the news following the return of the

- Indian football squad from Seattle
! yesterday noon.
MofTutt Worse
; Moffatt's buck injury was aggra
vated by his play in the Washington
! game Saturday, and Coach Warner
! declared yesterday that he was
i afraid that Phancy Phil might not be
| in shape to do the team much good
for the rest of the year. Moffatt
• wasn't himself in the Husky tilt and
| had to be taken out of the game.to
' protect his back soon after he went
j in, so Pop said.
However, Dr. Fritz Roth, team
physician, declared last night that
i the versatile Indian halfback will be
j "all right" for the U.S.C. game. Phil
j was ordered to stay away from
j practice last night but declared that
i he will be out of work this after -
I noon.
Gribbin, Ileiser Hurt
Both Gribbin and Heiser were
! hurt in the lengthy scrimmage work
; which Warner carried on behind a
J veil of secrecy yesterday afternoon,
j No definite word as to the condition
I of either could be obtained last night
| as Dr. Roth had not yet made an
; examination.
I Evidently cooking ujd something
I especially choice for the Trojan
! Thundering Herd, Pop excluded
| everyone not actually working with
I or for the squad from the practice
| session yesterday. Guards were
j posted with instructions to keep out
| all those with or without secret
! practice passes, even such import
j ant campus moguls as Track Coach
| Robert Lyman Templeton, News
Director Don Liebendorfer, and
| other officials connected with the
| Board of Athletic Control.
Pop Gives Dope
As a result, all news in regard to
j the doings of the squad came
, through the mouth of Warner him
j self. According to Pop the program
included some new plays, a hard
i general workout, and scrimmage for
I most of the men, both among them
; selves and against the Grays. Al
| though a number of the men who
i did not play in Seattle reported for
j work as early as 3 o'clock, the :jes
i sion was not terminated until nearly
' G o'clock, making it one of the
J longest practices of the year,
j As usual the Cardinal coach was
, reticent about his plans for the fu
l ture after his return home yester
j day, but he did indicate that capable
! Kenny Afflerbaugh will be moved
j ahead into the regular right half-
I back position which his excellent
• all-around work in recent games has
: earned for him. It was Kenny's two
i beautiful kicks in the last quarter
of Ihe Washington battle which
' made Pop decide to give him the
| top rating.
Afflerbaugh Is Kicker
If Moffatt is unable to play regu
larly Afflerbaugh is practically as
sured of working for a majority r>f
j the time in all of the important
games to come, for these two are
the only high calibre backs on the
! squad who can kick effectively.
Whereas the scoreless tie with
j Coach Jimmy Phelan's Huskies may
j have been a disappointment to some
: of the Indian followers, the Redskin
; headman, showed no great chagrin
; over the failure of his charges to
; score. He liked the play of all of
! the boys who got into the game,
| was particularly pleased with Spud
Hardy at left halfback, and thought
| the team in general did very well
lo hold the pepped-up Washington
: gridders to a tie.
