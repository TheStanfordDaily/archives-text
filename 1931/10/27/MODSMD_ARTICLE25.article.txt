LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 26. C/i>>
Miss Buth Nichols of Rye, Nov/
York, escaped injury today when
she leaped from her flaming mono
plane as it stood on the takeoff li:> ;
for a flight to New York.
The society aviatrix, who was se
verely hurt when she made a hasty
landing last June at St. John, N.8.,
was ready to complete a transcon
tinental flight when gasoline ignited
and set fire to her $25,000 plane.
Disregarding the fact that she still
wore a steel corset as a result of
her spinal injury, she jumped from
her ship to the ground.
