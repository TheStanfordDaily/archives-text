# THOSE TERRIBLE GREEKS
## 
### 
With the fall comes (he period of fraternity initiations
and the self-styled upholders of this advanced civilization
break into print condemning Hie terrible, barbaric, inhu
man practices of hell week.
This pre-initiation period fulfills a definite need in fra
ternity life, or it would not be the established tradition that
it has become. The modern Greeks are just as civilized
and humane as other people; they do not form a distinct
savage tribe, surrounded by, yet separated from the culture
of modern times. These university students would not
sanction a practice that was dangerous to the participants,
nor carry on this custom of hell week unless it was a defi
nite good.
Hell week is psychologically bound up with the frater
nity ritual, it is conducive to freshman discipline which is
essential in fraternity life, and it provides amusement, not
only for the members but, contrary to general opinion, for
the neophytes as well.
This practice, like anything else, is bad if carried- to
extremes, but in most fraternities, excessive paddling and
other physical tortures arc minimized to such an extent
that thev are harmless. Accidents happen rarely, but when
they do, press publicity plays them up and condemns the
practice as a whole, upon the basis of a few isolated cases
always bad logic, and an unfair method of criticism.
Hell week, after all, is a matter for the individual fra
ternities to decide upon for themselves. If they find it use
less, let them discard it; if they think that it is an essential
and necessary part of their initiation, Jet them continue it.
