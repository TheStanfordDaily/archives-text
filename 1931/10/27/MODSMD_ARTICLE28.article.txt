# ONE MORE TWISTED STORY

### 
Because Herbert Hoover is a Stanford graduate and
because the presidential election is not so far away, politi
cal opponents of the present national administration are
redoubling their efforts to strike at the President through
his alma mater. It is a sad commentary on the intelligence
of the average voter when newspaper editors believe that
such roundabout methods of assault are effective.
However, they do, as witness a report in a San Fran
cisco paper making much of the so-called controversy
concerning the "Hoover in '32" club formed on the campus.
The paper in question, an out-and-out anti-Hoover organ,
described the exchange of opinions by Abe Mellinkoff, Hull
Session writer, and Joseph Xutt, president of the newly
formed club, as "verbal pyrotechnics." The entire article
was intended to color the incident highly and make it
appear that the Stanford campus was torn by political
strife.
As a matter of fact, Null's letter, printed in Friday's
Campus Opinion column, merely agreed with Mellinkoff's
opinion that Stanford men should vote for the man they
think best tilted for the Presidency, not blindly for Hoover
because he is a Stanford alumnus â€” certainly a sound
policy.
The newspaper in question has been guilty of news dis
tortion in connection with Stanford before. By continuing
that practice, it is cheapening itself beyond redemption in
the eyes of those who know the facts.
