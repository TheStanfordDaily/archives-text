# AS THE TWIG IS BENT

### 
Crystallization of the idea of familiarizing new stu
dents with the principles of the Honor (.ode into ;i definite
campaign is ;i move in the right direction, for as the twig
is hent, so the tree inclines.
Those who have been at Stanford over a period of years
know that the conditions under which the Honor ('ode was
operating were not all that they could have been. Last voar|
marked a definite change in student opinion from one of
lackadaisical, carefree indulgence toward those who vio
lated the Code to an attitude of energetic disapproval.
The councils, taking cognizance of the straws which in
dicated the gale, tightened up on the regulations affecting!
violators and convictions resulted in severe penalties.
It is always debatable whether the possibility of severe
the "weeding-out process" is undoubtedly beneficial. The
the "wecding-out" process" is undoubtedly beneficial. The
principal benefit, however, lies in another direction; that
is, in amassing a preponderance of student sentiment and
opinion against unfair practices in examinations and re
ports, because public opinion properly wielded becomes
an irresistible force.
Beginning as it does with the incoming students who
are absorbing their first impressions of Stanford, the edu
cational campaign just started by the Men's Council should
produce real results in the formation of active student
opinion and ultimately eliminate any vestige of dishonor.
All members, new and old, of the editorial side will
gather to hear words of great wisdom at I o'clock today
or have a swell excuse.
Meeting of all \K\V members of the Business Staff will
be held Wednesday evening, at 7 :'Â»(>.
