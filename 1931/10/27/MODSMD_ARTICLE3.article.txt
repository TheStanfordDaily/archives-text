# LEGISLATURE VOTES WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
## 
### 
MANILA, Oct. 26. (A*) â€”Women
would be given equal political rights
with men, to vote and hold office,
under a bill passed tonight by the
Insular House of Representatives.
Legislative circles believe, how
ever, that the Philippine Senate will
not pass the bill, or if it does, will
merely give women the right to
vote, not the right to hold office. '
The Islands will be the first coun-
Iry in the Orient to have woman
suffrage if the measure finally is
enacted.
