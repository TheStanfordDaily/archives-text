# BULL SESSION
## THE 						HONOR CODE EXPLAINS ITSELF 
### 
Way back in that dark age—the
spring quarter of 1931—.the Bull
Session urged that the Men's Coun
cil define exactly what was honor
able and what was dishonorable
conduct at Stanford University. To
night that hope is being realized in
a very excellent manner when the
Honor Code is to be explained to a
group of new students; this orienta
tion is to be continued until all new
students have attended these in
formal meetings and all have a
thorough knowidege of what is
.proper conduct in the fulfilling of
all elasswork, And after the new
; students have been initiated into the
I subtleties of honor, it wouldn't be a
bad idea to start on the old students.
1 People's concepts of honor vary
greatly, and if students are to be
expelled for Code violations, it is
only just that they understand ju.it
what the Men's and Women's Coun
cils' understanding of cheating is.
Defining cheating as "Unpermitted
j Aid" is hedging of an obvious va
riety; the present series of confer
ences should raise all points of doubt
■ which should be answered definitely
by Ihe Council members.
In attacking the action of the
Councils, many idealists have
claimed that honor is unenforceable.
■ While theoretically abstract honor
I cannot be enforced, the absence of
1 the proctor system or more posi
tively the so-called "Honor System"
| can be forced on those who do not
' wish to live up to its dictates. The
majority of the students would not
j cheat knowingly whether there was
or was not a Council to hand out
; punishments; there is, however, a

certain minority that are honest, not
through conviction, but due to ex
pediency. The reins that keep this
group in control is the threat of
punishment, and its severe and un
flinching application.
Then again, some claim if this
minority wish to cheat, let them
cheat; they are hurting no one but
themselves. This might be true, ex
cept that we are working under a
competitive system at Stanford. The
honest student should not be penal
ized l'nr his honesty by the average
raising practices of the dishonest.
While it is true that grades are not
the important thing at college, they
are the practical medium by which
we stay in university.
The Honor Code has not been
completely successful in the past.
That is putting it as mildly as is
possible. The Honor Code should be
possible in an institution of higher
learning—a place where the so
called cream gathers—and where the
higher things in life are said to be
pursued. If the present series of
conferences and others that will
probably follow can inculcate in the
student body a pride in the Code,
the present system will last. If the
students continue to consider the
Honor System as a tottering hang
over, like the Hello Spirit, it will be
highly desirable to turn to the proc
tor system as soon as possible, rather
than hold to something that is
crumbling to bits in the very hands
of those that are seeking to sustain
it.
A genuine responsibility rests
with the Class of 35 in particular
and the present student body in
general. —Abe Mellinkoff.

A genuine responsibility rests
with the Class of 35 in particular
and the present student body in
general. —Abe Mellinkoff.
Way back in that dark age—the
spring quarter of 1931—.the Bull
Session urged that the Men's Coun
cil define exactly what was honor
able and what was dishonorable
conduct at Stanford University. To
night that hope is being realized in
a very excellent manner when the
Honor Code is to be explained to a
group of new students; this orienta
tion is to be continued until all new
students have attended these in
formal meetings and all have a
thorough knowidege of what is
.proper conduct in the fulfilling of
all elasswork, And after the new
; students have been initiated into the
I subtleties of honor, it wouldn't be a
bad idea to start on the old students.
1 People's concepts of honor vary
greatly, and if students are to be
expelled for Code violations, it is
only just that they understand ju.it
what the Men's and Women's Coun
cils' understanding of cheating is.
Defining cheating as "Unpermitted
j Aid" is hedging of an obvious va
riety; the present series of confer
ences should raise all points of doubt
■ which should be answered definitely
by Ihe Council members.
In attacking the action of the
Councils, many idealists have
claimed that honor is unenforceable.
■ While theoretically abstract honor
I cannot be enforced, the absence of
1 the proctor system or more posi
tively the so-called "Honor System"
| can be forced on those who do not
' wish to live up to its dictates. The
majority of the students would not
j cheat knowingly whether there was
or was not a Council to hand out
; punishments; there is, however, a

certain minority that are honest, not
through conviction, but due to ex
pediency. The reins that keep this
group in control is the threat of
punishment, and its severe and un
flinching application.
Then again, some claim if this
minority wish to cheat, let them
cheat; they are hurting no one but
themselves. This might be true, ex
cept that we are working under a
competitive system at Stanford. The
honest student should not be penal
ized l'nr his honesty by the average
raising practices of the dishonest.
While it is true that grades are not
the important thing at college, they
are the practical medium by which
we stay in university.
The Honor Code has not been
completely successful in the past.
That is putting it as mildly as is
possible. The Honor Code should be
possible in an institution of higher
learning—a place where the so
called cream gathers—and where the
higher things in life are said to be
pursued. If the present series of
conferences and others that will
probably follow can inculcate in the
student body a pride in the Code,
the present system will last. If the
students continue to consider the
Honor System as a tottering hang
over, like the Hello Spirit, it will be
highly desirable to turn to the proc
tor system as soon as possible, rather
than hold to something that is
crumbling to bits in the very hands
of those that are seeking to sustain
it.
