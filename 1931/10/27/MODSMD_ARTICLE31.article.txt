## A 						FEW CENTS MORE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The new policy adopted by the j
Daily at the beginning of the cur
rent quarter, that of ceasing the do- 1
livery of the Daily to the students
residing in Paly, has occasioned
some controversy on the matter. The j
sore point, on the side of those stu- '
dents affected, seems to be the fact j
that apparently the Daily is dis- :
criminating unfairly against some 1
four hundred students living in !
Paly, for the Daily is delivering, as j
( usual, to the remaining thirty-two |
hundred students who live on the j
campus. Apparently the Paly resi- i
dents have a clear case, inasmuch as '
they are paying as much for their !
subscription as are the rest of the
students.
The Daily, of couise, had good j
1 reasons for making the move. The ;
expense of delivering the Daily to !
the students in Paly was approxi- I
mately the same as the cost of de- i
livering to the whole campus. Such
a reason is no doubt a good one, but !
perhaps it is not quite sufficient, i
j There is no doubt that the Daily is I
' finding it hard to make ends meet, !
and if it is the duty of the students I
to co-operate with the Daily in this !
respect (and it surely is), the ques- j
tion arises: should the entire bur- !
den of giving this added support to j
the Daily fall upon such a small :
j majority of the student body?
The fundamental basis of the
problem is that the Daily has as- 1
: sumed more expenses for its issue ;
over the past few years without a i
j corresponding increase in its sub- i
scription rate. The Daily has not :
only increased its size from five to |
eight columns, improving its type,
and added in the general appearance
of its sheets, but it has also in â€”
; creased its salaried staff. All this has
been accomplished on the same j
1 funds that put out the much in- |
ferior paper of other days. The Daily
is to be complimented for its prog- :
ress and for the fact that it has |
done well on such limited funds. i
But the Daily is now "running in
the x-ed," and the higher-ups are
forcing them to economize. Again,
should this economizing program hit
a small part of the students or all
of them? Obviously it should be
shared by all.
, However, it does not seem neces- j
sary that the Daily stop delivery to i
any of the students. A few cents j
added to the tuition of each student !
would provide ample funds to cover j
all expenses of the Daily, including j
that of delivering the paper to all i
I the students, both on the campus ;
and in Paly.
Sincerely, lan M. Rid-lev.
