The Editor, Sir:
A pitiful situation must exist in j
a newspaper office when it is found !
necessary to look a gift-horse in th? j
teeth to the extent, of denying paid i
subscribers the right to receive the 1
paper. It is lamentable indeed when |
so much is spent in making a paper j
what it is that no funds are loft I
with which to fulfill the only object j
any paper has: to carry to its sub- J
scribers the latest news of pertinent j
events.
Of course it will be agreed by
everyone that four or five copies i;s
ample for any six Hall men (the
ratio is not in vogue in Encina), ro
with very little persuasion it shouid ;
not be over-difficult to apply the
same or even a better ratio over the
entire campus, including our down- j
town friends. The simplest way of I
doing this is naturally to eliminate
the downtown customers, who don'l :
count for much anyway, seeing they I
haven't been able or willing to go
Row or live in the halls. Anyway, '
people who live downtown probably
don't care much for school unity ]
and all that bosh, so why should ,
ihey be interested in what goes on i

! out on the campus? They are in the
, minority* anyway, so why worry?
Yes, let them wait till they can
pick up their copy at the Engineer
| ing Corner or some other place
where a pile has been placed. They
will probably wait a long time Tor
! the vanished pile to rpappcar, but
' the "temporary change is unavoid-
I able," so with a cheerful smile let
jus repeat the well-worn phrase,
'"prosperity is just around the cor
! ner."
j What the Student Body might be
| interested in knowing, is just where
\ the various funds of the paper go
j that make its delivery to subscribers
'an unattainable luxury.
