Not so glum as might have been
expected was Coach "Pop" Warner
when he arrived back in Palo Alto
yesterday noon. That scoreless lie
up at Seattle didn't seem to worry
him greatly; in fact he felt rather
.pleased by the .showing of the In
dian eleven.
"Washington proved to be a tough
assignment, just as we expected,'
said Pop, when interviewed at his
home soon after his arrival. "Our
offense was handicapped more than
theirs, because they were used to
handling a wet ball. I thought the
team did well to make the showing
it did."
Warner was particularly pleased
with the Indian defense, and the
punting of Afflcrbaugh.
About thai little U.S.C'. mat
ter: Warner, expressing surprise
at the great showing made by
California Saturday, doesn't be
lieve it will prove any help to
Stanford.
"If there was any swell-head
edness in the Southern Califor
nia squad, California took it out
of them Saturday. It may he
just what U.S.C. needed to bring
them to a fighting pitch for the
Stanford game," said the Old
Man.
The Bruins are serious about this
game Saturday. With "the strongest
team in their history, they are en
tertaining high hopes of an upset
victory.
And none other than "Tricky
Dick" Hyland, former Stanford star,
motion picture actor, writer, and
what have you, is helping them in
their attempt to do it.
It was Hyland, you will remem
ber, who was instrumental in Stan
ford's last victory over U.S.C. —in
11)26. He caught a pass on the dead
run to score Stanford's second and
winning touchdown, and blocked
one of the Trojan conversion at
tempts to give the Indians a 13 to
12 win.
With no important game
scheduled for any of California's
"Big Three" this week-end, the
St. Mary's-Santa Clara fray this
Sunday will take the gridiron
spotlight.
That St. Mary's bubble was
nearly burst Sunday, when Lit
tle Gonzaga gave the Gaels their
biggest scare of the season. The
Broncos Mill undoubtedly enter
the game on the short end of the
odds, hut with the breaks, they
might slip over a win 011 the
thus far undefeated Gaels.
A versatile fellow, this Geoi'ge
Herman Ruth, otherwise "Babe."
His present exhibition tour is by
no means limited to knocking home
runs over minor league fences.
San Jose promoters attempted to
bring the Babe there for an exhibi
tion game, but when it could not
be arranged, Ruth agreed to referee
ihe main event of a charity card to
be held there Thursday night.
Meanwhile when the home run
record-holder can't find anything
else to do, he shoots a good game
of golf on the nearest links.
Stanford ball fans may get a
glimpse of Ruth sometime
Thursday, if he can find time
between his numerous engage
ments. The Babe is an old friend
of Harry Wolter. Indian baseball
coach, and may stop at the Farm
to sign a few baseballs on his
way to San Jose. —L.M.C.

tion game, but when it could not
be arranged, Ruth agreed to referee
ihe main event of a charity card to
be held there Thursday night.
Meanwhile when the home run
record-holder can't find anything
else to do, he shoots a good game
of golf on the nearest links.
Stanford ball fans may get a
glimpse of Ruth sometime
Thursday, if he can find time
between his numerous engage
ments. The Babe is an old friend
of Harry Wolter. Indian baseball
coach, and may stop at the Farm
to sign a few baseballs on his
way to San Jose. —L.M.C.
Not so glum as might have been
expected was Coach "Pop" Warner
when he arrived back in Palo Alto
yesterday noon. That scoreless lie
up at Seattle didn't seem to worry
him greatly; in fact he felt rather
.pleased by the .showing of the In
dian eleven.
"Washington proved to be a tough
assignment, just as we expected,'
said Pop, when interviewed at his
home soon after his arrival. "Our
offense was handicapped more than
theirs, because they were used to
handling a wet ball. I thought the
team did well to make the showing
it did."
Warner was particularly pleased
with the Indian defense, and the
punting of Afflcrbaugh.
About thai little U.S.C'. mat
ter: Warner, expressing surprise
at the great showing made by
California Saturday, doesn't be
lieve it will prove any help to
Stanford.
"If there was any swell-head
edness in the Southern Califor
nia squad, California took it out
of them Saturday. It may he
just what U.S.C. needed to bring
them to a fighting pitch for the
Stanford game," said the Old
Man.
The Bruins are serious about this
game Saturday. With "the strongest
team in their history, they are en
tertaining high hopes of an upset
victory.
And none other than "Tricky
Dick" Hyland, former Stanford star,
motion picture actor, writer, and
what have you, is helping them in
their attempt to do it.
It was Hyland, you will remem
ber, who was instrumental in Stan
ford's last victory over U.S.C. —in
11)26. He caught a pass on the dead
run to score Stanford's second and
winning touchdown, and blocked
one of the Trojan conversion at
tempts to give the Indians a 13 to
12 win.
With no important game
scheduled for any of California's
"Big Three" this week-end, the
St. Mary's-Santa Clara fray this
Sunday will take the gridiron
spotlight.
That St. Mary's bubble was
nearly burst Sunday, when Lit
tle Gonzaga gave the Gaels their
biggest scare of the season. The
Broncos Mill undoubtedly enter
the game on the short end of the
odds, hut with the breaks, they
might slip over a win 011 the
thus far undefeated Gaels.
A versatile fellow, this Geoi'ge
Herman Ruth, otherwise "Babe."
His present exhibition tour is by
no means limited to knocking home
runs over minor league fences.
San Jose promoters attempted to
bring the Babe there for an exhibi
tion game, but when it could not
