LOS ANGELES—(SpeciaI to Scan
ford Daily), Oct. 20. (A I ) — The
! U.C.L.A. Bruins will inVade tlie
i Stanford Farm next Saturday with
! a rooting contingent that is all
pepped up to see Bill Spaulding's
j team pull an upset and beat a major
| conference foe for the first time.
Rooters Confident
While that assignment has the
j look of impossibility, to outsiders,
I home rooters confidently look to the
Bruins to come through with a vic-
I tory. The defense has been proved
against both Washington State and
Northwestern, while the offense
began to click against Pomona lust
Saturday, and your loyal Son of
Westwood is willing to dig into his
| jeans and lay money on the line,
with odds of course.
Occidental College held the Bruins
1 to a 0-0 score in the opening game,
'and Blue and Gold supporters still
stiffen whenever Oxy is mentioned.
The defensive showing against
1 Washington State and Northwestern,
! however, changed all that, and in
; stilled renewed hope in the West
] wood ranks. Pomona was crushed
by the Bruins, 4G-0.
Bruins at Peak
The Bruins will be as near the
j peak Saturday as they will get all
J season. They should have their
I maxim of plays by then, the new
| shift should have been perfected,
j and the men should be in the best
I of condition. But whether that will j
I be adequate to cope with the Big '
: Red team remains to be seen.
Since the squad arrived home
from Chicago last week, Bill
Spaulding has drilled on noth
ing but offense. By his side con
tinually has been Dick Hyland,
| once a Stanford star, who for
some unknown reason has i
I switched his allegiance to West
wood. The Bruins don't ask the ,
| reason for this transference of
affection, but accept it at its j
face value and welcome Hy~ 1
land's coaching as a possible j
turning-point in the develop- i
mcnt of an adequate offense, j
What U.C.L.A. has needed for a
long time is a keen football
j mind in the coaching ranks, and
Hyland has that, Stanford sup
porters must admit.
Stanford has been on everybody's
j lips for months. The cry, "Get Stan
' ford" began even before the football !
| season. It has grown apace with ihe !
favorable showing of the Bruins in j
: recent games. The Uclans conli- i
dently expect to win, and it will be j
j quite an afternoon's job for the In- I
i dians to get that notion out of the j
| minds of the Southerners.

LOS ANGELES—(SpeciaI to Scan
ford Daily), Oct. 20. (A I ) — The
! U.C.L.A. Bruins will inVade tlie
i Stanford Farm next Saturday with
! a rooting contingent that is all
pepped up to see Bill Spaulding's
j team pull an upset and beat a major
| conference foe for the first time.
Rooters Confident
While that assignment has the
j look of impossibility, to outsiders,
I home rooters confidently look to the
Bruins to come through with a vic-
I tory. The defense has been proved
against both Washington State and
Northwestern, while the offense
began to click against Pomona lust
Saturday, and your loyal Son of
Westwood is willing to dig into his
| jeans and lay money on the line,
with odds of course.
Occidental College held the Bruins
1 to a 0-0 score in the opening game,
'and Blue and Gold supporters still
stiffen whenever Oxy is mentioned.
The defensive showing against
1 Washington State and Northwestern,
! however, changed all that, and in
; stilled renewed hope in the West
] wood ranks. Pomona was crushed
by the Bruins, 4G-0.
Bruins at Peak
The Bruins will be as near the
j peak Saturday as they will get all
J season. They should have their
I maxim of plays by then, the new
| shift should have been perfected,
j and the men should be in the best
I of condition. But whether that will j
I be adequate to cope with the Big '
