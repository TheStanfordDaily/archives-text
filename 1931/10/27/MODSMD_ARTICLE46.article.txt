# ALL-AMERICAN ERNIE
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Ernie Pinckert is U.S.C.'s All-
American halfback. He looks like a
movie star, wants to be a sports
cartoonist, and is one of the best
blockers now playing football.
Pinckert. is one of the "Noblest Tio
jans of Them All," no doubt about
that, and made most of last year's
Ail-American teams, despite the fact
that he seldom carried the ball.
His business was to mop up ahead
of the climax-runners, to clear ihe
path of would-be tacklers and to
pave the way for the heroes of the
day. The fact that Ernie made the
mythical All-Star teams last year
shows how well he did his job, be
cause he displaced someone whose
name was set up in big type much
more often than that of Pinckert.
But occasionally they did give
Ernie the ball, and when he got it
he knew what to do with it. Coach
Howard Jones devised a short-side
reverse play for Pinckert, on which

J the big, good-natured halfback aver
!aged about 13 yards last season.
Against Stanford, Pinckert con
verted a miscue by Orv Mohler,
from whom he had to take the ball
jon this play, into a touchdown.
' Mohler fumbled and recovered while
! Ernie waited patiently at his post,
then swooped by, took the ball, and
I went through the Stanford line as
i though the play was being run as
! scheduled He galloped 74 yards to
! a touchdown, returned, breathing
hard, saying, "Don't call that signal
again. Those long runs hurt my
| corns."
Pinckert. reminds one of "Tack"
Hardwick of Harvard, who used to
clear the way for Eddie Mahan
seventeen years ago. He has been
known to take out three successive
j tacklers without being knocked
down himself. A "football-player's
player," this man, and a rpal All
: American.


Looks Like a Movie Star, But rlays a 1 rue All-American;
Blocking Is His Forte
