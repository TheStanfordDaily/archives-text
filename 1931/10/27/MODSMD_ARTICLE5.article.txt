# CAPONE REMAINS IN COUNTY JAIL
## Three Federal Judges Allow One Day For Appeal 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 26. (/P)—Alphonse !
Capone remained in the Cook Coun- j
ty jail tonight, saved another day
from Leavenworth Prison by a brief
order of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals.
Three circuit judges heard the j
gangst'res lawyers plead for his 1
freedom while he appeals his con- 1
viction as an income tax dodger, |
heard a federal prosecutor say he j
should be put away immediately for i
the good of the public, and then :
told the United States marshal to {
wait at least another day before ,
starting for the federal penitentiary \
with Capone.
The judges said they would •an- :
nounce their decision on a writ of j
supersedeas and an appeal bond at I
2 o'clock tomorrow. Federal Judge j
James H. Wilkerson, who sentenced j
the gang chief to eleven years' im- j
prisonment ,told the marshal to wait '
until today-to permit his lawyers j
to appeal to the higher court for !
bond.
The hearing before the three |
judges, Samuel A. Schuler, Evan A.
Evans, and, William M. Sparks, was J
rather informal, with the jurists do
ing much of the talking.,
Attorney Albert Fink told them 1
there was no reason why Capone 1
should not be given the same privi- j
lege as other defendants and re- j
leased from custody while he ap
pealed his case. The government's j
case would probably be reversed j
later anyway, Fink argued; it was j
built on faulty arguments.
