# BRADSHAW WORKS TO IRON OUT BABE FOOTBALL FAULTS
## Moran School Expected To Offer Much Trouble On Saturday 
### BY SPUD HAMILTON 
With a hard game coming up Sat
urday and the climax of the season
a week following that, the Stanford
freshmen will work hard this week
picking up the loose ends of the
Trobabe disaster. The team looked
anything but good down South, and
Coach Bradshaw is vastly disap
pointed with its showing.
Tackles Hurt
The two first-string tackles were
injured early in the game, and two
green men were responsible for
checking the heavy U.S.C. off-tackle
attack for the larger part of the
contest. Tlie Indians presented an
invulnerable defense everywhere
but at the flanks. Here the Trojans
gained with every effort, and the
elusive little Warburton could not
be stopped once past the line of
scrimmage.
Moore, Van Kirk, and Mottrarn
made a valiant battle and showed up
well but they did not receive enough
help from their mates. Stanford
simply was not in a class with its
Southern opponents.
Keller Out for Season
The team received a heavy set
back with the loss of Keller, first
string tackle, who was hurt during
the first quarter. He will bo unable
to compete during the remainder
of the season.
Instead of picking an easy team
the week before the Little Big
Game, it looks very much as though
Stanford were in for an absorbing
afternoon. Moran School is classed
as a junior college and is located
r.ear San Luis Obispo. They have
been cleaning up all the competi
tion in their section with monoton
ous regularity and will make the
journey to the Farm all pepped up
with the idea of driving through a
decisive victory over a Stanford
freshman team.
