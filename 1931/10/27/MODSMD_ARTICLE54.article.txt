## Forward Line Drilled For Match With Mission; Backfield Strong

l Today the Indian soccer varsity
will attempt to do what the year
i lings were unable to do ;,i few weeks
; ago, when they try to humble the
! Mission High outfit at 4 o'clock 011
j the varsity field.
Although the Cards should have j
I little trouble in coming out 011 the
I long end of the score, the city |
preppers will undoubtedly put up a j
! good exhibition of soccer,
j Yesterday was freshman day on
the soccer field. Playing against the
varsity, the yearlings clearly showoM
j that they were more lhan just
1 eleven men watching the varsity
i practice. Only two goals were netted
1 Ly the Red Machine after about
twenty minutes play.
Moving Kennedy, formerly at
i center half, up to the center forward
(position, and placing White, a new- !
comer, at the center half post, Eber- j
j hart made a smart move to in- j
1 crease the freshman scoring power. |
A short passing game was again j
; stressed by Harry Maloney before I
, the scrimmage began, when the var- !
/ sity forward wall composed of
1 Mearns, Falk, Hearn, Beggs, and
Viguie worked out on the dummy
goal.
With the first California game
coming up on Saturday, the Indians j
will have to reach top form in order
to take the Bears into camp. Re
ports from Berkeley indicate that
CaJiiornia is as strong as ever, and
presents a well-balanced team.
This lack of balance on the Stan
ford outfit is the chief worry of the
Farm's soccer fans. Too much has j
depended on the works of the backs
in the games up to date. The for
wards will have to become'more ac
j curate if the Cards are to defeat
| ihe Blue and Gold.
