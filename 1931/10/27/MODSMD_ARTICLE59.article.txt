# REPRESENTATIVES OF MINING INDUSTRY MAKE ATTACK ON ANTI-TRUST LAWS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 26. (/Pi— Rep-
resentatives of the oil, coal, and j
copper industries today laid down j
the principles they believe will help j
them back to normalcy.
Addressing the New York Uni
versity conference on the relation j
of law and business, with specific j
emphasis on the anti-trust laws, C. j
B. Ames, vice-president of the Texas j
company, urged interstate compacts ]
among oil producing states.
He also attacked the anti-trust
laws as forbidding legitimate co
operation because they threaten !
criminal prosecution of violators J
without defining clearly what viola- j

tions are:
Discussing copper, Cornelius F.
Kelley, president of the Anaconda
Copper Mining Company, also at
tacked the law for the same reasons,
and proposed, as did Ames, that
some body be provided which could
pass on agreements between busi
ness persons before they were exe
cuted, meanwhile exempting thom
from the criminal provisions of the
law.
Charles O'Neill, chairman of the ;
Government Relations Committee of
the National Oil Association, found
little complaint with the law. He
held that the coal industry could i
co-operate now—if it would.
