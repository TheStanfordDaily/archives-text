HERE COMES YOUR SOLE
LEATHERS
Down in South America our leather buyers know their
steers. They pick them only in the "short hair" season.
That means a sturdier, springier hide. After seven
months' work by Walk-Over tanners only the finest part
(about 25' > ) is cut up for sole leather. No wonder your
Walk-Overs feel so flexible on your feet and wear, wear,
wear.
