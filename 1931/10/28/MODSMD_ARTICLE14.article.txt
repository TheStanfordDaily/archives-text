# Warner Taking No Chances On Upset Of Cards Saturday
## Pop Sending Team Through Stiff Practice Scrimmages This Week in Order to Avoid Midseason Upset by the U.C.L.A. Bruins 
### DICK RODDA 
pOP WARNER doesn't want any inore of his big red machines to he
wrecked by mid-season upsets. And to prevent the recurrence of such
upsets which have too frequently heen administered by one Santa Clara
Bronco, Pop is sending his charges through stiff scrimmages this week
for the coming contest Saturday with the U.C.L.A. Bruins. That the
IJclan game will he no "breather" was indicated by Warner last nii>ht

when he expressed the thought that
it would not be impossible for the
Bruins to win.
Look For Tough Fight
"We are planning for a tough
fight from U.C.L.A.," declared War
ner, "and practice this week is being
concentrated on this game." At the
same time, however, it is no secret
that the old man is devoting much
of his practice sessions this week
toward the U.S.C. game of the fol
lowing Saturday.
".Tricky Dick" Hyland, former
Stanford backfield ace, is assisting
Bill Spaulding and his Bruin back
field. Hyland, who is visiting the
campus this week, expressed ihe
opinion that Stanford will defeat
the Uclans, but not by a large score.
Not in Cards' Class
"U.C.L.A. is not as yet in a class
with the Cards," said Dick, "but if
Stanford has an off day and the
Bruins look as they have in a few
games this year, the Indians may
find themselves in a real grid
battle."
The "real" secret football practice
yesterday found Stanford's first and
second teams scrimmaging against
each other for the most part. The
Grays scrimmaged with the varsity
toward the close of the three-hour
session.
Entire Squad Out
The entire squad was on the field
last night with the exceptiton of
Pete Heiser, guard. Pete is still in
the hospital suffering from a knee
injury he received Monday night.
Red Gribbin, who was also injured
Monday, was in a suit last night but
did not participate in the scrim
mages. Both Gribbin and Heiser will
probably return to the squad at
least before the Trojan contest.
Phil Moffatt was also on the field
last night but it has been definitely
decided that he will not be used in
the Bruin contest. In fact, Phil may
not be ready for the Trojan game.
Kenny Afflerbaugh is being used in
Moffatt's place at halfback.

Bruins to win.
Look For Tough Fight
"We are planning for a tough
fight from U.C.L.A.," declared War
ner, "and practice this week is being
concentrated on this game." At the
same time, however, it is no secret
that the old man is devoting much
of his practice sessions this week
toward the U.S.C. game of the fol
lowing Saturday.
".Tricky Dick" Hyland, former
Stanford backfield ace, is assisting
Bill Spaulding and his Bruin back
field. Hyland, who is visiting the
campus this week, expressed ihe
opinion that Stanford will defeat
the Uclans, but not by a large score.
Not in Cards' Class
"U.C.L.A. is not as yet in a class
with the Cards," said Dick, "but if
Stanford has an off day and the
Bruins look as they have in a few
games this year, the Indians may
find themselves in a real grid
battle."
The "real" secret football practice
yesterday found Stanford's first and
second teams scrimmaging against
each other for the most part. The
Grays scrimmaged with the varsity
toward the close of the three-hour
session.
Entire Squad Out
The entire squad was on the field
last night with the exceptiton of
Pete Heiser, guard. Pete is still in
the hospital suffering from a knee
injury he received Monday night.
Red Gribbin, who was also injured
Monday, was in a suit last night but
did not participate in the scrim
mages. Both Gribbin and Heiser will
probably return to the squad at
least before the Trojan contest.
Phil Moffatt was also on the field
last night but it has been definitely
decided that he will not be used in
the Bruin contest. In fact, Phil may
not be ready for the Trojan game.
Kenny Afflerbaugh is being used in
Moffatt's place at halfback.

wrecked by mid-season upsets. And to prevent the recurrence of such
upsets which have too frequently heen administered by one Santa Clara
Bronco, Pop is sending his charges through stiff scrimmages this week
for the coming contest Saturday with the U.C.L.A. Bruins. That the

it would not be impossible for the
Bruins to win.
