# Trojan Gridders Start Workouts For Indian Game
## No Game Saturday Allows Chance For Rest 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27. (/P)â€”'The
Trojans of the University of South
ern California today began pointing
| for the game with Stanford a week
from Saturday in the Olympic Sta
dium.
One of the first moves made by
Coach Howard Jones was to shift
I Johnny Baker, running guard, to an
j end position. Just who Baker will
i replace in the first string was not
j announced but it was generally con
ceded that Garret Arbelbide will
not get first call in the game with
the Indians.
Jones was dissatisfied with the
I Trojans' ability in getting down un
i der punts in last Saturday's game
j with California. Sparling, who
i played against the Bears with an
I injured ankle, is expected to be in
good shape for Stanford.

The Trojans will have an open
date this coming Saturday.
