j dramatic ability to give an outstand- !
| ing performance.
An actor of proven experience !
and talent who has done work here j
j and also during the summer in Car- (
mel productions will be seen sis
Tom Pettigrew. Ed Girzi, as thij
1 langorous, lazy, drunken good-for
nothing, eighteenth-century man j
. about town, has some of the most :
' humorous lines of the comedy. His i
entertaining interpretation adds im- I
measurable charm to a clever and i
delightful character.
As the bustling Mrs. Fixit, ar- j
j ranger par excellence, Catherine |
Crary is taking a role entirely dif—
| fercnt from any of her previous
. work. She shows definite promise
[of working into her part and should
give a creditable performance.
