# ETHICS IS TOPIC OF PHILOSOPHER
## Dr. Moritz Schlick Speaks At Tuesday Lecture 
### 
Virtue as distinguished from hap
piness in the conception of a moral
life, was the chief point of last
night's lecture given by Dr. Moritz
Schlick, professor of philosophy at
the University of Vienna.

Ethics, as understood by modem
philosophers, is not a science, be
cause the facts of ethics are human
feelings and actions, Dr. Schlick de
clared. A study of these becomes
applied psychology.

For this reason, according to the
lecturer, ethics is not a question of
how a man lives but how he ought
to live. The usual ethical opinion is
that man should live a good life,
and the everyday meaning of "good"
is that which in any way pleases
us, or which we value for any rea
son. A moral meaning of "good,"
Dr. Schlick said, is that which is
valuable according to a moral law.
Thus, a good life is a happy life,
according to the first definition, and
a moral life according to the second
definition.

Dr. Schliek believes that the dif
ference between a good life and a
happy life is marked. He says that
the best people are not always the
happiest people because a man's
happiness is not controlled entirely
by his own actions. Environment
and chance are influential factors.

Man's actions then, the speaker
stated, can be directed by a consid
eration either of present happiness
or a preparation for future happi
ness. Preparation for future happi
ness would involve a scheme of
present conduct which would make
it possible for the individual to en
joy future actions.
