; freshmen 6-1 two weeks ago, the
| varsity soccer team yesterday hand
j ed the city youngsters a 3-1 defeat.

Beggs drove the ball past the Mis
| sion goalie. This ended the scoring
i for the first half.
Coming back after the half-time
i rest Stanford showed its one flash

| tack.
The game dragged on for perhaps
i twenty more minutes, until Art
' Hearn emerged from a mix-up in
| front of the visitors' goal with an
| other score for Stanford.

and Stanford comfortably in the
lead. Coach Maloney commenced
throwing in substitutes. Shortly al
ter Williams went in for goalie Web
| ster the high-school boys banged
i through their only score of the nf
! cernoon.
