# ILLEGAL RUSH PRACTICES ARE HIT BY BOARD
## Anonymous Reports Not To Be Considered; Names Kept Confidential PROCEDURE CHANGED Active Campaign Started By Control Board 
### 
The Intel fraternity Board of Con
trol decided on an active campaign
against illegal rushing last night at
its meeting in the Old Union. A
motion was carried providing that i
written or verbal report to either
Warren Brings, chairman of the
board, or W. B. Owens, a faculty
representative, giving the time,
place, and guilty parties to the il
legal act, is all that is necessary to
bring offenders to trial before the
board.

All parties on trial will be given
a full opportunity to present their
case and exonerate themselves. The
name of the person who reports the
illegal rushing is to be considered
confidential, but the members con
demned anonymous reports.

Briggs made an appeal to the fra
ternities to aid in stamping out il
legal rushing and expressed the
hope that the houses would deal
with the freshmen according to
rushing rules. The board will not
act hastily, but its penalties wilt bo
serious on conviction.

The problem of appointing a per
manent chairman of the board,
either a faculty member or an
alumnus, was brought up, but the
system of having an undergraduate
chairman was continued. Members
felt that the faculty representatives
would lend necessary continuity to
the organization, while an under
graduate chairman would better
keep the interest of the houses.

To take care of regular business,
a monthly meeiing to be held the
first Wednesday of each month was
approved. However, special meet
ings may be called any time to take
care of the trials for infractions of
rushing rules or other pressing
business.
