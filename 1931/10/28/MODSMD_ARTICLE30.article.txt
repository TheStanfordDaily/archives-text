# SECRET PRACTICE

### 
A lei lor in Ihe Dailt/ I'rincctonian protests the custom
of secret practice for the football team. The writer de
clares that undergraduates would take a far greater inter
est in the team were they allowed to view it in scrimmage
during the week; that being turned away from the practice
field like a spy or a criminal is not conducive to whole
souled support of the varsity.
Coach "Pop" Warner has decreed absolutely secret
practice for the Stanford squad this week, probably next
week. Me lias done that in the weeks preceding the Trojan
game for the past three years, and no one has ever ques
tioned the justice of it.
Xew plays, new defenses, must have the element of
surprise to succeed. Coaches here and elsewhere have had
trouble with careless undergraduates who have unwit
tingly given away secrets by talking to persons who they
think are disinterested.
An example of how those things can happen occurred
a few years ago, when a California player told a girl friend
about some secret plays. The girl casually mentioned it to
her father, and the latter, a Stanford graduate, offered to
turn the information over to Stanford authorities. Natu
rally, it was refused, but the incident serves to show why
secret practice before important games is justified.
