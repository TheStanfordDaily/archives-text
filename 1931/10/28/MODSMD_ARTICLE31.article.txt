# SPEEDY DISMISSAL
## 
### 
U.C.L.A. students convicted of speeding on the campus
will he instantly dismissed from the university, according!
lo a press dispatch from Los Angeles.
The report adds that this stringent measure had been
taken to cut down the lf>() accidents occurring monthly on
the campus with injuries totalling twice that number. In
adequate police protection and absence of stop signs were 1
blamed for the large number of mishaps.
Police officials, flatly accused of inetliciency by the pres
ident of the associated student body, say they are working
(i n a traffic system for West wood and the campus.
This harsh measure of expelling students for the in
fringement of traffic rules is imposing a penalty whose!
severity is out of proportion to the size of the offense.
Driving a few miles faster than the law allows is not suf-,
ficient excuse for dismissal from the university. 1
Perhaps when I lie new traffic system is installed, this
exaggerated ruling will be rescinded. Hut even uiider the*
present traffic conditions, such a penalty is unnecessary
and unfair.
Stanford students should give thanks that when they
are convicted of infringements of traffic laws, they are
only subject lo punishment by fines as in any other well
organized community.
