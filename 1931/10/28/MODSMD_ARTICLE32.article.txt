From England comes the press dispatch reporting thai
bootlegging in the t'nited States "results in the corruption
of police and law courts." In the same article, George Ber
nard Shaw is quoted as telling the World Prohibition Fed
eration that such corruption is no reason for doing away
will) prohibition, and he further states that the "direct re
sults of prohibition in the t'nited States have been success
ful in every way, but some of the indirect results have been
very curious.'"
The Hon. Mr. Shaw is right, at least in this case, for if
is ;i curious commentary on American legal procedure to
have prohibition that doesn't prohibit. Intoxicants are ob
tainable in virtually unlimited quantities in every impor
tant city in the country, not to mention in a vast majority
of the smaller cities and townships. Much lias been written
and many theories have been advanced lo cover this state
of affairs, but the solution seems elusive as ever.
What hurts most of all, though, is the growing contempt
for America and American institutions that is reflected in
current European literature and press dispatches. The
whole world is subjecf to trying conditions in politics, in
economics, and in social problems and the t'nited Stales
is held up as the goat.
In order to command the respect of the neighbor na
tions which have been brought into our own back yard bv
speedier communication, it is necessary to keep our own
slate clean. Isolation can no longer be maintained ainj. il
is better lo have fear and respect than fear and contempt.
