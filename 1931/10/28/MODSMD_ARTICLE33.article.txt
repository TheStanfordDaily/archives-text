## TO DELIVER OR NOT TO DELIVER 
### 
The big problem that is worrying
the campus these days—or more
properly the question that is raising
the blood pressures of the '(HK)" is
the non-delivery of papers to the
off-campus students. No one can
blame any student £or complaining
about anything—that is the great
American privilege and pastime
combined. 11 King George had al
lowed a few Americans to sit, com
plain, then be out-voted in the Brit
ish Parliament, the Revolution
might have been postponed or even
diverted entirely.
It is always bad psychology to
take something away from anybody;
whether the thing taken is valuable
or deserved is of no consequence.
Natural instinct holds on. Today, we
find the off-campus students com
plaining because the Daily has been
forced to stop delivering papers to
their changing domiciles. Anyone
will admit that if a student has been
used to trotting out and picking up
a Daily, his ire will be greatly
raised when he trots out by force
of habit to find his pre-eight o'clock
companion missing. This writer
sympathizes with any student who
makes the supreme effort of throw
ing off the covers and ventures into
the biting cold five minutes beforo
it is necessary; and then returns
empty-handed from his windy for
age. It is enough to make anybody
write campus opinions or even
do worse.

It is generally known that the
Daily was forced to limit Palo Alto
distribution, not to fill up the Cam
pus Opinion column, as some might
suppose, or to crowd the business

f office with complaining readers, but
because stationary costs plus a de
creasing income made this economy
necessary. It is claimed that it is
j discrimination against a minority to
i make them pay for a general con
; dition. By the same measure, is it
not discrimination against the gen -
: eral student body for the '600" to
use more than their proportionate
J share of distribution allotments?
While it is true that all pay the
| same subscription charge, those liv
ing in Palo Alto have been a greater
i drain on the Daily—even though
j they paid no more. If justice is to
i be done, it would only be fair to
| charge the off-campus students more
for their Daily. If it seemed that
, the majority of the "600" wanted
J Ihe Daily delivered' above all else,
i the Business Office will arrange, this
! writer feels sure, not only to have
the Daily delivered at their door
j but taken in ar>d laid on their bed
I if they so desire—but for a mone
j tary consideration, of course.
At many universities, all studcnls
j are forced to get their papers from
! piles placed in various places on the
| campus. Here, where most live in
j definite local groups, it was found
j possible to deliver to halls and fra
| ternity houses and at a very small
j cost. However, where an off-campus
! population exists, the Daily has
j finally been forced to do what most
I colleges do. During the last four
j week-days, not only have there been
j ample Dailies in the Library at 0
! o'clock; but no less than about 50
copies have still been available at
[ 6 in the evening.

The big problem that is worrying
the campus these days—or more
properly the question that is raising
the blood pressures of the '(HK)" is
the non-delivery of papers to the
off-campus students. No one can
blame any student £or complaining
about anything—that is the great
American privilege and pastime
combined. 11 King George had al
lowed a few Americans to sit, com
plain, then be out-voted in the Brit
ish Parliament, the Revolution
might have been postponed or even
diverted entirely.
It is always bad psychology to
take something away from anybody;
whether the thing taken is valuable
or deserved is of no consequence.
Natural instinct holds on. Today, we
find the off-campus students com
plaining because the Daily has been
forced to stop delivering papers to
their changing domiciles. Anyone
will admit that if a student has been
used to trotting out and picking up
a Daily, his ire will be greatly
raised when he trots out by force
of habit to find his pre-eight o'clock
companion missing. This writer
sympathizes with any student who
makes the supreme effort of throw
ing off the covers and ventures into
the biting cold five minutes beforo
it is necessary; and then returns
empty-handed from his windy for
age. It is enough to make anybody
write campus opinions or even
do worse.

It is generally known that the
Daily was forced to limit Palo Alto
distribution, not to fill up the Cam
pus Opinion column, as some might
suppose, or to crowd the business

f office with complaining readers, but
because stationary costs plus a de
creasing income made this economy
necessary. It is claimed that it is
j discrimination against a minority to
i make them pay for a general con
; dition. By the same measure, is it
not discrimination against the gen -
: eral student body for the '600" to
use more than their proportionate
J share of distribution allotments?
While it is true that all pay the
| same subscription charge, those liv
ing in Palo Alto have been a greater
i drain on the Daily—even though
j they paid no more. If justice is to
i be done, it would only be fair to
| charge the off-campus students more
for their Daily. If it seemed that
, the majority of the "600" wanted
J Ihe Daily delivered' above all else,
i the Business Office will arrange, this
! writer feels sure, not only to have
the Daily delivered at their door
j but taken in ar>d laid on their bed
