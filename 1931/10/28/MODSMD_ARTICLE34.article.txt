FLIGHT INTO DARKNESS — By
Arthur Sohnitzlor. New York. lfKil.
Simon and Schuster. (At the Pnio
Alio Book Store.)
Super-analytical, as Schnitzler's
books are bound to be, "Flight Into
Darkness" forces one into self-ob
servation by its startling mental
realism. o*Nt a biography, and not
quite a novel in the visual sense of
the word, this brief volume provides
excellent material for a thinker who
does not take himself too seriously.
It is the inner story of a man ob
sessed by the idea that he has com
mitted crimes in the occasional
periods of mental void to which he
has been subject. He fears so
strongly that he may some day be
come insane that he convinces him
self that his brother will ruin his
happiness, when he finally finds it,
by publicly pronouncing him men
tally deranged. So he kills his
brother, and dies, himself, in flight
from the dead man. We are told that
this obsession was really caused by
a premonition of what was to hap
pen.
Treated wholly subjectively, the'
story is a definite asset to the mod
ern library of psychological art.

THE LIMESTONE TREE—By Jo
seph Hergeshciiner. New York, j
Alfred A. Knopf. 19:51. (At the j
Stanford Bookstore.)
Here is a book in which the au- I
thor accomplishes an unusual thing, j
He fills 386 pages with the chronicle j

| of the lives of the members of the
I families of Abel, Cutt, and McKee
| and keeps the reader interested ;n
! all of them.
I "The Limestone Tree" deals with
j a period of over 100 years in Ken
: tueky. It commences with the first
' settler, Daniel Boone, in 1775. James
j Abel was one of the pioneers who
helped Boone colonize Powell's Val
| ley. American history throughout
| the Civil War is reflected in the
hardy Abel family.
Hergesheimer emphasizes the loy
i alty and fine moral qualities which
; lie underneath the rough exteriors
| of these settlers of limestone Ken
j tucky. He brings it out in the reac
! tions to the Kentuckians of John
Dixon Folkes who represents con
i tinental culture. Folkes gives them
1 the highbrow O.K. when he ex
; presses his admiration of these real
: people. —E.T.P.
