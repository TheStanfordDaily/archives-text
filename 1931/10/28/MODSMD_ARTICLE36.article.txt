The Editor, Sir:
I would like to call the attention
of your readers to a typographical
error made by your typesetter in my
recent letter. In speaking of de
liveries of the Daily in Encina, I
said four or five papers to six men
is the ratio NOW in vogue in vhe
Hall, but by a small error, the whole
meaning was changed by the sub
stitution of the word NOT. The
point is that there is a shortage of
papers delivered to the Hall, and
men who get up late find no paper.
