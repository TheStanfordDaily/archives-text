' Just what," somebody queried
us yesterday, "do you mean by all
this 'in stride' business? All we
have heard all season is that Stan
lord has taken each game 'in stride.'
Now what the heck?"
"In stride" IS an overworked ex
pression, but it does describe the
way in which "Pop" Warner has
approached each game so far this
season. Not once has he "pointed"
(to use another time-worn expres
sion) J'or an opponent, not EVEN
Washington.
What the Old Man HAS done
has been to bring the team along
slowly, taking each game as it
came, gradually building toward
the Southern California crisis.

Now about this Trojan business:
Stanford has hardly shown enough
thus far to be given an even break
with the Howard Jones eleven. But
the Terrible Trojans can be stopped
St. Mary's sneaked over a win at
the opening of the season, and a
lighting California eleven very
nearly did the same last Saturday.
As for the Indians, they WILL
be at this much discussed
"peak" for the game, they WILL
be at maximum strength.
Whether that will be strong
enough remains to be seen. Just
HOW strong the 1931 Stanford
varsity is will not be demon
strated until (hat fateful No
vember afternoon.
"They won't push vis around."
That's what Bill Ingram declared
b< fore his Golden Bears met the
Trojan onslaught, and that, in effect,
i;, what Warner has said all season
concerning the Indians.
Maintaining that Stanford has
only an "average" team and that
the chances of beating U.S.C. are
very slight, Warner nevertheless has
been emphatic in his statements that
last year's massacre will not be re
peated.
"And of course we aren't con
ceding them the game by any
means," the Old Man. said re
cently.
Basis may be lacking for pre
dicting an Indian victory, but
(tie chance for an upset win
DOES exist.
Boxing stock is picking up. Jim
mie Johnson, Madison Square Gar
den promoter, who promises to do
more for the game than anyone
since the days of Tex Rickarcl, is
angling for a Jack Dempsey bout.
Johnson means business, and if
anybody can lure Dempsey back
into the squared circle, it is he.
A real test of just how much
Max Baer, the Livermore heavy
weight hope, has improved, will
be afforded in his bout with
Johnny Kisko, Cleveland "rub
ber man," booked for Seals'
Stadium on November 9.
Baer dropped a decision to Risko
during his ill-fated invasion of the
East. If he can stop the Cleveland
"trial horse" this time, however, it
will put him back on the road to
the front ranks of the heavyweight
division.
That's what "Tricky Dick"
ll,viand remarked when he read
the report from the U.C.L.A.
campus that he had "switched
his allegiance to Westwood."
And we don't blame him.
It seems that Hyland has been
aiding Kill Spaulding in de- .
vcloping an offense since the
start of the season, but not for
the particular purpose of up
setting Stanford. —L.M.C.

Johnson means business, and if
anybody can lure Dempsey back
into the squared circle, it is he.
A real test of just how much
Max Baer, the Livermore heavy
weight hope, has improved, will
be afforded in his bout with
Johnny Kisko, Cleveland "rub
ber man," booked for Seals'
Stadium on November 9.
Baer dropped a decision to Risko
during his ill-fated invasion of the
East. If he can stop the Cleveland
"trial horse" this time, however, it
will put him back on the road to
the front ranks of the heavyweight
division.
That's what "Tricky Dick"
ll,viand remarked when he read
the report from the U.C.L.A.
campus that he had "switched
his allegiance to Westwood."
And we don't blame him.
It seems that Hyland has been
aiding Kill Spaulding in de- .
vcloping an offense since the
start of the season, but not for
the particular purpose of up
setting Stanford. —L.M.C.
' Just what," somebody queried
us yesterday, "do you mean by all
this 'in stride' business? All we
have heard all season is that Stan
lord has taken each game 'in stride.'
Now what the heck?"
"In stride" IS an overworked ex
pression, but it does describe the
way in which "Pop" Warner has
approached each game so far this
season. Not once has he "pointed"
(to use another time-worn expres
sion) J'or an opponent, not EVEN
Washington.
What the Old Man HAS done
has been to bring the team along
slowly, taking each game as it
came, gradually building toward
the Southern California crisis.

Now about this Trojan business:
Stanford has hardly shown enough
thus far to be given an even break
with the Howard Jones eleven. But
the Terrible Trojans can be stopped
St. Mary's sneaked over a win at
the opening of the season, and a
lighting California eleven very
nearly did the same last Saturday.
As for the Indians, they WILL
be at this much discussed
"peak" for the game, they WILL
be at maximum strength.
Whether that will be strong
enough remains to be seen. Just
HOW strong the 1931 Stanford
varsity is will not be demon
strated until (hat fateful No
vember afternoon.
"They won't push vis around."
That's what Bill Ingram declared
b< fore his Golden Bears met the
Trojan onslaught, and that, in effect,
i;, what Warner has said all season
concerning the Indians.
Maintaining that Stanford has
only an "average" team and that
the chances of beating U.S.C. are
very slight, Warner nevertheless has
been emphatic in his statements that
last year's massacre will not be re
peated.
"And of course we aren't con
ceding them the game by any
means," the Old Man. said re
cently.
Basis may be lacking for pre
dicting an Indian victory, but
(tie chance for an upset win
DOES exist.
Boxing stock is picking up. Jim
mie Johnson, Madison Square Gar
den promoter, who promises to do
more for the game than anyone
since the days of Tex Rickarcl, is
angling for a Jack Dempsey bout.
