# Bruins Likely To Prove Dangerous, Says Keen
## INDIANS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE UCLANS IN STRIDE Daily Bruin Sports Editor Thinks U.C.L.A. May Surprise Cards

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27. (Special
to the Daily)â€” Can Stanford take
U.C.L.A. in .stride?
In Ihe answer to that question
lies the outcome of Saturday's game
between the Bruins and the Indians.
The Reds must take the Westwood
ers in stride if they hope to face
the Trojans on equal terms in that
ail-important engagement Novem
ber 7. With Troy uppermost in their
minds, the members of the Stan
ford squad may be prone to over
look the up-to-this-season incon
sequential Bruins. But the Bruins
are not to be overlooked this season,
and therein "Pop" Warner has a
problem which places him in some
what of a dilemma.
If "Pop" holds out, he certainly
saves his team for the Trojans the
week following. Holding out on the
Bruins, however, is apt to be a
tough proposition.
Powerful Line
The Bruins go north Thursday
night with a line that fairly oozes
power from tackle to tackle. Put five
men such as Lloyd McMillan, Ed
Austin, Homer Oliver, Bull Jones,
and Mike Dimas in a forward wall
and you have some forward wall,
that's all there is to it.
McMillan and Dimas make a fine
pair of tackles. The former is a
senior, weighs around 185 pounds,
and rarely has a substitute in for
.him. His work during the past two
years has branded him as the most
consistent line man on the team.
Dimas is a sophomore, but has al
ready shown his capabilities by
shoving the veteran "Fat" Norfleet
out of the picture.
Guards Good
The Bull Jones-Ed Austin setup
jat the guards is another veteran-
I sophomore combination. Jones is the
I running guard and leads the Bruin
i interference. He is a big, husky chap
! in the vicinity of 190 pounds and a
! powerful man. Austin rivals his
j running mate in build and is equally
i capable as a standing guard.
Homer Oliver, the center, tips the
! beam at around 200 pounds. He
I failed to flash much in early season,
; but against Washington State and
| Northwestern played superb foot
' ball.
Ends Not Weak
Saying that the line from tackle
; to tackle is powerful does not imply
that the wings are weak. Far from
i it, if Dick Mulhaupt, the 135-pound
i end, starts along with Len Wellen
dorf. These two men make the
1 Bruin flanks well-nigh impregnable,
j but the loss of either one breaks up
, this efficiency about fifty per cent.
! At the present time there is a pos
j sibility that Mulhaupt may not play,
due to an injury. This reminds
Bruin fans of last year's Stanford
| game, when, with Mulhaupt on the
i bench, the Reds made two long
| runs around his substitute for
I scores.
