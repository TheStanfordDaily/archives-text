# ANOTHER LONG COUNT
## "Count" Orsi, Captain and End of This Year's Colgate Varsity, Is Andy Kerr's Big Threat 
### Feg Murray, '16 
j New York University, like Jack
! Dempsey, was the victim of a "long
J count." Dempsey's disaster occurred
I in his fight with Tunney in Chicago
! in 1927; N.Y.U.'s happened in their
I game with Colgate in 1930. It was
| a charity game and Colgate, one of
i the best teams in the country, was
i leading 7 to 0. Then Chick Meehan's
1 Violets scored, but Long John Orsi,
i otherwise known as "Count" Oi - si,
j blocked the kick that would have
I tied the score.
This year Count Orsi is captain
I and Colgate has another fine eleven.
| It just had to happen for, if you'll
j pardon a pun, it was bound to
I "o-Kerr," Andy Kerr being ihe
1 capable and efficient coach of the
I mighty Maroons from Hamilton,
1 New York. Len Macaluso, Colgate's
j All-American fullback of 1920, is
I now a pro wrestler, but I have a
I hunch that he won't be missed as
badly as many suspected. You see,
! Colgate still has Andy Kerr —and
j Count Orsi.
This big end is a whole regiment
i of cavalry in himself ("all the King's
I Orsi's," you might say( and, in 26
! or 27 consecutive games, including
j his freshman season, was never
j forced to call time out. He weighs
J 185 pounds, stands six feet.tall, and
! is fast and rugged. The Count, so
j called because his ancestors in Italy
| were of the nobility, is Colgate's
I only three-sport letter man at pres
i ent, and is a star at basketball and
; baseball, as .well as football. His
basketball experience helps him

| when it comes to receiving passes,
| and he is a fine runner, too.
Orsi comes from West Orange,
I New Jeisey, and is nobody's lemon
j in a football game. Lew Andreas,
j former Syracuse coach, and Vic
i Hanson, his successor, have both
i declared Orsi the best wingman
| they have ever seen.

This year Count Orsi is captain
I and Colgate has another fine eleven.
| It just had to happen for, if you'll
j pardon a pun, it was bound to
I "o-Kerr," Andy Kerr being ihe
1 capable and efficient coach of the
I mighty Maroons from Hamilton,
1 New York. Len Macaluso, Colgate's
j All-American fullback of 1920, is
I now a pro wrestler, but I have a
I hunch that he won't be missed as
badly as many suspected. You see,
! Colgate still has Andy Kerr —and
j Count Orsi.
This big end is a whole regiment
i of cavalry in himself ("all the King's
I Orsi's," you might say( and, in 26
! or 27 consecutive games, including
j his freshman season, was never
j forced to call time out. He weighs
J 185 pounds, stands six feet.tall, and
! is fast and rugged. The Count, so
j called because his ancestors in Italy
| were of the nobility, is Colgate's
I only three-sport letter man at pres
i ent, and is a star at basketball and
; baseball, as .well as football. His
basketball experience helps him

| when it comes to receiving passes,
| and he is a fine runner, too.
Orsi comes from West Orange,
I New Jeisey, and is nobody's lemon
j in a football game. Lew Andreas,
j former Syracuse coach, and Vic
i Hanson, his successor, have both
i declared Orsi the best wingman
| they have ever seen.
