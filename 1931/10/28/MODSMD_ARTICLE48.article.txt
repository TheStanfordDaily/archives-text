### Francis Hamilton 
The Stanford Grays will play the i
' first of their two arranged games j
i Saturday when they meet the San !
1 Francisco University reserves here. I
J The kick-oft' is scheduled for 10 ■
j o'clock on the Grays' field.
Coach Cuddeback is particularly
| enthusiastic over one of his new
backs, Oppenheim. The latter has a
j wealth of accomplishments. He kicks j
■ and passes well, has a good power j
J drive, and is a threat in the open, j
! besides being an expert blocker. All |
j he lacks is experience to be of var- !
j sity calibre. This is Oppenhehn's j
third year in school, but he has i
never been out for football beforo. J
Moreover, Cuddeback has a num- j
ber of men who played for last ;
year's freshman team. Packard and '
Miller are a pair of ends that are j
in this class. Tarver and Tatum were '
likewise outstanding men in the ;
11930 yearling line. Tarver has been :
[ out of action with an injured shoul-- |
I der for several weeks but he prob- '
i abily will be ready for duty in the I
I coming clash. Gould and Freeman !
| are another pair of linesmen who '
I have fought their way into recogni- (
i tion, while Lipscomb is a promising {
; backfield candidate.
