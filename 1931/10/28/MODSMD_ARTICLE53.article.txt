# GRACE MOORE TO PRESENT PROGRAM TUESDAY, NOV. 3
## Singer Renowned As Prima Donna, Concert Artist, And Screen Star 
### 
Grace Moore, lyric soprano of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, will
open the A.S.S.U. Concert Series in
the Pavilion next Tuesday evening
at 8:20 o'clock with a varied pro
gram of songs. She is now engaged
on a concert tour extending from
coast to coast, after which her
fourth consecutive season with the
Metropolitan Opera Company will
begin.
Starting her musical career as a
choir-singer in the small town cf
Jellicoe, Tennessee, Miss Moore is
now well known as a prima donna,
a concert artist, and a screen star.
Co-starred with Lawrence Tibbett
in "The New Moon" and cast in the
leading part of Jenny Lind in "A
Lady of Morals," she has twice ap
peared on the talking screen.
Debut Successful
The role of the pathetic Mimi in
"La Boheme" was chosen by Grace
Moore for her debut in New York
in February 1928, in which she was
enthusiastically received.
A year later she was accorded a
second triumph in the same role at
the Opera Comique in Paris, re
ceiving ten curtain calls after the
first act. On this occasion the Paris
edition of the Chicago Tribune
stated that "not since the days when
Mary Garden made her sensational
debut at the Opera Comique has
any young American artist met with
such an instantaneous success."
Musical Comedy Star
Miss Moore had previously
achieved success in musical come
dies, notably "Up in the Clouds,"
"Hitchy-Koo," and Irving Berlin's
Music Box Review, where she
worked to earn money for the long
training necessary before she could
achieve her dream of grand opera
stardom. She has studied with some
of the foremost vocal teachers of
the world, including Dr. P. Mario
Marafioti and Samuel Chotzinoff.
Tickets for the concert to be given
by Grace Moore are now on sale at
the Concert Series office at a re
duction of fifty cents, single admis
sion being $2, $1.50, and $1. Season
tickets may also still be bought at
the regular price.
