# STUDENT CHECK ACCOUNTS DECREASE BY TEN PER CENT THIS YEAR, SAY BANKERS
## 
### SHERIDAN HEGLAND 
Due to the depression, Stanford j
students have slashed their budgets
approximately 10 per cent, Palo Alto j
bankers asserted yesterday. "Pre- ,
depression" found students J
spending about $1100. Present bank
accounts indicate that students will j
find it necessary to curtail their ex- j
penditures more than $100.
Bank managers claim that several '
students are finding it expedient to !
carry their spending money with j
them; as a consequence, student ac
counts have suffered a 20 per cent
drop.
Strangely'enough, students are
cashing fewer N.S.F. checks than i
formerly, cashiers assert. Last year, ;
it will be recalled, Palo Alto bankers j
bitterly comjjlained against student j
carelessness, charging that students ,
were among the worst offenders in ;
the writing of bad checks.

j More than 90 per cent of student
! accounts lack the required minimum
J of $50 and suffer the monthly pen
! alty of a 50-cent charge, Robert
i Gray, bank clerk, claims.
Other stray facts regarding stu-
I dent accounts: more women carry
| accounts than men; about half of
| the student body own checking ac
j counts; most students replenish
' dwindling accounts by monthly
! checks from home.
Due to the large number of checks
cashed, per person, about 25 a
month, bankers find student ac
counts unprofitable. However, bank
| ers emphatically deny that they are
i contemplating the issuance of
j "crcdit-coupons" to replace check
j ing accounts.
Bankers rejected the plan, it is
j said, because of the storm of protest
| from student quarters that was al
i most certain to follow its adoption.
