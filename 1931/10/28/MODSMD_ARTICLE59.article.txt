# PRIMITIVE WINDING CRANK CONTROLS CHIMES, TOWER CLOCK, CLASS BELLS
## 
### 
The peal of bells which sounds
doom to students at the hour of an
ex, or release at Friday noon, or
seems a tradition of the good old
Quad upon return from vacation, de
pends simply on a crank which
someone must wind a certain
amount every other day.

This crank is part of a simple
mechanical device which controls
both the chimes, the clock, and the
class bells. Having climbed up the
steep frame stairs inside the clock
tower, one may see the mechanism.
It occupies about 24 cubic feet of
space and is composed of a series
of wheels and levers. A pendulum,
attached underneath, regulates the
time and a propeller-like balance,

extending from one side, controls
the chimes. Winding l'ather than
electricity makes this primitive de
vice "tick." Although the chimes
require winding every other day,
the clock will run alone for a week
at a time.

On the platform in the tower near
the controls is a bit of broken ma-

chinery. It, as well as the clock in
use at present, is a remnant of the
original four-face clock which !
graced the spire of the Memorial i
Church before the earthquake. The |
clock in the tower is the only ona i
of the four that was not smashed '
when the spire fell. The bell tower, |
as we know it now, was built in j
1912. The chimes are the same that j
were used in the Church..
