# CARD FROSH START CONCENTRATING FOR GAME WITH BEARS
## 
### 
With the U.S.C. Trobabe scrap j
completely off their minds, and only !
Moran School between them and 1
U.C., Stanford's freshman squad can
begin building for their meeting ;
with the California Cubs. Not to j
say that Coach Jimmy Bradshaw j
has not been building for the Berke
ley men all season.
Now that Stanford has made such
a dismal record against U.S.C., I
nothing but a flash-of stylish form
against the California frosh will sal
vage its season. Comparative scores j
do not count, but one can hardly !
erase without qualms that 65-point I
advantage that the Bears hold over
the Cardinal yearlings on paper.
One thing is certain, Coach Brad- 1
shaw will give his ends and tackles
a thorough polishing before Novem
ber 7. Bradshaw has no wealth of
tackle material. With Keller, who
has played regularly all season, out
of service, two green men must fill
his vacant position. Savage and
Steiner are the reserves who will ,
mate â€¢ with Lettunich al these im
portant line posts.
