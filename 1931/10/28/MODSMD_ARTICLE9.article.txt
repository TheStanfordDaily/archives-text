# BERLIN EXPECTS WAR DEBT MOVE
## Foreign Office Looks To Laval And America 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 27 (/P). â€”The Ger
man foreign office expects that when
Premier Pierre Laval returns to
France he will inaugurate with
American supoprt what will turn
out to be a re-examination of war
debts as well as reparations.
This expectation, it is understood,
is based in part at least on reports
received by the foreign office from
Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm von Pritt
witz-Gaffron, Germany's ambassa
dor at Washington, covering the
conference between President Hoo
ver and the French Premier. M. La
val now is homeward bound on the
lie de France.
Reports Aid Leaders
The ambassador's reports, it was
said, have enabled the German lead
ers to see more clearly what is ex
pected of them by the Premier and
the President.
"What will probably happen," said
the foreign office spokesman, "is
this: M. Laval will ask authoriza
tion from the French cabinet to sug
gest to Germany that she take the
initiative? and ask for the appoint
ment of a Special committee from
the Bank for International Settle
ments as provided in the Young
Plan.
"M. Laval's suggestion will be sec
onded by the American government.
Debts Involved
"This committee will probably
soon find that the reparations ques
tion cannot be settled without also
tackling war debts, so that Ger
many's action will logically lead to
a discussion of the inter - allied
debts."

It was learned yesterday at the
French foreign office that Chancel
lor Heinrich Bruening, acting on the
joint statement issued by President
Hoover and Premier Laval at the
conclusion of their talks, would lose
no time entering into negotiations
on the reparations question.
