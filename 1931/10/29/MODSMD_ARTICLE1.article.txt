# LABOR WHIPPED AS MACDONALD SWEEPS BRITAIN
## National Cabinet Wins 555 Commons Seats Out Of 608 Returns LABORITES SHATTERED Baldwin Acclaims Victory "Step To Democracy" 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 2!). (/P) —Ar- j
thur Henderson, leader of the
Labor party who was defeated
in his own district, said in his
message tonight:
"A shattering blow has been
dealt at Labor in Parliament.
This is not the first time the
electors have been duped on a
grand scale, but what is aston
ishing is to find that the old
electioneering deception has
been utilized by men who in
the past have been victims with
us of wild and vile calumnies.
"It would be idle to deny that
Labor has suffered a severe set
back, but the Labor government j
is not broken, its spirit is not {
crushed."
McDonald Dominates
Swept into power with a majority
of more than 500 of the 615' seats in :
the House of Commons, Prime Min- I
ister Ramsay Mac Donald's national i
government will be able to dominate
Parliament as no other administra- J
tion in the history of democratic j
Britain.
Tonight, with GOB returns avail- i
able from yesterday's voting, there !
were 555 government supporters, !
only fifty in the opposition and three
independents.
Labor Loses 235
The loss of 235 seats nearly wiped
out the Labor representation in the |
House of Commons. Nothing like it j
ever occurred before in Great |
Britain.
The Conservative party held 472 1
seats, with prospects of gaining a
few more in the late returns. This j
great Conservative strength led to i
the expectation that a demand for i
a full-blooded protection tariff pol- I
icy would be the first trouble en- J
countered by Mac Donald.
But, although an emergency tariff
within a couple of weeks of the re- i
convening of Parliament is a prob
ability, the Prime Minister is pledged
not to impose a general protective I
tariff until it has been fully investi- |
gated and scientific tariff legislation I
has been prepai'ed.
Called National Victory
Great significance was seen in a |
statement by Stanley Baldwin, Con-.|
scrvative leader, who declared yes
terday's results showed a national I
and not a party victory.
Although Baldwin did not go into
the part the Conservatives will play
in the House of Commons sched- |
uled to hold its first session Novem- t
her 3, his statement was taken to I
indicate he would make no attempt !
to seize power for his party.
"The election is an emphatic dec- j
laration by the people as a whole in I
favor of national co-operation to re- i
store the fortunes of our country," J
Baldwin said.
Resounds Over World
"The effect on foreign opinion j
cannot be overestimated. The over
whelming support given to the na- J
tional government will resound
through the world and re-establish j
confidence in. the stability and I
greatness of our country. Democ- j
racy has justified itself in a most j
striking fashion."
Mac Donald and Philip Snowden, j
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who i
followed the Prime Minister from |
the Labor Cabinet into the National
government, also viewed the voting |
as vindication for the National Min- I
istry and not a party victory.

Resounds Over World
"The effect on foreign opinion j
cannot be overestimated. The over
whelming support given to the na- J
tional government will resound
through the world and re-establish j
confidence in. the stability and I
greatness of our country. Democ- j
racy has justified itself in a most j
striking fashion."

Chancellor of the Exchequer, who i

as vindication for the National Min- I
istry and not a party victory.
LONDON, Oct. 2!). (/P) —Ar- j
thur Henderson, leader of the
Labor party who was defeated
in his own district, said in his
message tonight:
"A shattering blow has been
dealt at Labor in Parliament.
This is not the first time the
electors have been duped on a
grand scale, but what is aston
ishing is to find that the old
electioneering deception has
been utilized by men who in
the past have been victims with
us of wild and vile calumnies.
"It would be idle to deny that
Labor has suffered a severe set
back, but the Labor government j
is not broken, its spirit is not {
crushed."
McDonald Dominates
Swept into power with a majority
of more than 500 of the 615' seats in :
the House of Commons, Prime Min- I
ister Ramsay Mac Donald's national i
government will be able to dominate
Parliament as no other administra- J
tion in the history of democratic j
Britain.
Tonight, with GOB returns avail- i
able from yesterday's voting, there !
were 555 government supporters, !
only fifty in the opposition and three
independents.
Labor Loses 235
The loss of 235 seats nearly wiped
out the Labor representation in the |
House of Commons. Nothing like it j
ever occurred before in Great |
Britain.
The Conservative party held 472 1
seats, with prospects of gaining a
few more in the late returns. This j
great Conservative strength led to i
the expectation that a demand for i
a full-blooded protection tariff pol- I
icy would be the first trouble en- J
countered by Mac Donald.
But, although an emergency tariff
within a couple of weeks of the re- i
convening of Parliament is a prob
ability, the Prime Minister is pledged
not to impose a general protective I
tariff until it has been fully investi- |
gated and scientific tariff legislation I
has been prepai'ed.
Called National Victory
Great significance was seen in a |
statement by Stanley Baldwin, Con-.|
scrvative leader, who declared yes
terday's results showed a national I
and not a party victory.
Although Baldwin did not go into
the part the Conservatives will play
in the House of Commons sched- |
uled to hold its first session Novem- t
her 3, his statement was taken to I
indicate he would make no attempt !
