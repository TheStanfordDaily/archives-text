# TOKYO WARNS RUSSIANS OFF BORDER LINES
## Moscow Protest Expected; Japan Agrees To Submit Plaints To League 
### 
TOKYO, Oct. 28. (/P) â€” Japan
moved today to protect her interests
in Northern Manchuria, requesting
Russia to stop troop concentrations
on the Manchurian border, and
sending engineers north along the
Supingkai-Taonan-Anganchi Rail
way to cross the Chinese Eastern
line and reopen the direct road
from Taonan to Tsitsihar.
Troops accompanied the engineers.
This is farther north in Manchuria
than any Japanese troops have gone
since Russo-Japanese relations were
resumed in 1925.
The foreign office will submit to
the League of Nations council a list
of Sino-Japanese treaties it feels
China has failed to respect. China
is on record at Geneva as acknowl
edging her obligation under the
league covenant to respect treaty
stipulations.
Clash Six Weeks Ago
Thus the sixth week of the pres
ent Manchurian difficulty brought
no sign of the direct Sino-Japanese
negotiations upon which the league
council rested such hope, and no
indication of withdrawal of Japanese
forces in Manchuria to the areas to
which their activities are limited by
treaty.
The trouble started September 18
with a clash near Mukden over a
railway bridge Japanese guards
claimed Chinese soldiers were try
ing to damage. The Chinese have
denied this.
It was another bridge which led
today to the dispatch of the Japa
nese engineers to Anganchi.
Chang Rebels Routed
Taking advantage of the disor
ganization which followed Japanese
occupation of Mukden and other
Manchurian governmental centers,
General Chang Hai-Peng, Heilung
kiang province rebel, sought to
seize Tsitsihar, provincial capital,
and set up a separate government.
Forces loyal to the Nationalist
governor, Wan Fu-lin, routed
Chang's troops, but meanwhile
wrecked three railroad bridges along
the Nonni river to hinder the rebels'
movements.

There was some speculation
whether the Moscow government
would reply to the "troop concen
tration" note with a protest against
the work of these engineers, since
the Russians protested against the
original extension of the line to
Tsitsihar, as it robbed the Chinese
Eastern Railway, which is owned
jointly by Russia and China, of
much Tsitsihar traffic.

The Russian government was
quick to protest a month ago when
Japanese took over the Chinese
Eastern station at Changchun, junc
tion point with the South Manchu
rian, and detained several Russian
employees.
