# Sons Of Three Premiers Compete For Parliament
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
I "A phase of Tuesday's election in
England that is particularly inter
esting to me is the contesting of
their seats in Parliament by pre
mier's sons," said Hugh M. Clokie,
| visiting professor from Rutgers in
the Department of Political Science,
yesterday. He is, himself, an Eng
i lish voter.
Sons of British political leaders
i who came up for re-election Tues
day were Malcolm Mac Donald,
| Oliver Baldwin, and Lloyd George's
j son and daughter. Miss George is
j the first premier's daughter to enter
| Parliament. Both of the Georges are
j members of the Liberal Party, which
| their father heads. Oliver Baldwin,
j an ardent Laborite, is hardly on
I speaking terms with his Conserva
tive father, Clokie said.
Baldwin Loses
Young Baldwin lost his election,
j Moagan George kept her seat, and
1 returns have not yet been received
! for young George.
i "Malcolm Mac Donald's case is
more unique than theirs," Clokie
; said. He and Mac Donald were at
j Oxford together in 1020. "To begin
I vvilh hi' is naturally a retiring young
1 man who is interested in collecting

| books and in art. He was a member
of the Oxford debating team that
j toured this country in 1925. Malcolm
has really been urged into politics
by his father. At first he acted as
j secretary to him, but in 1929 he
gained, as a Laborite, a seat of his
j own in Parliament."
Victory Unusual
i His victory was considered re
markable since he was competing
j with a famous lawyer, Clokie con
tinued. The vote was overwhelm
ingly in young Mac Donald's favor.
In addition to this seat in the House
of Commons he holds one of the
smaller posts in the Ministry.
"Recently, when Ramsay Mac-
Donald left the Labor party to head
the National Cabinet, his son was
one ol the 20 or HO of the party
who followed him. Malcolm found
himself without a party and without
his father's prestige. It was com-
I parable to Ihe status of A1 Smith
were he to come out as a member
of the Republican party for prohibi
tion.
"So Malcolm has won," said Clokie
when told the news that had just
come over the wire. "Good for him.
j I am surprised."
