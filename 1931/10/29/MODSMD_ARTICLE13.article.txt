# HOOVER NAVY POLICY HELD DETRIMENTAL
## Ignorance Display Charged In Treatment Of New Marine Economy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. (/Pi —
President Hoover was charged by
the Navy League today with ex
hibiting an "abysmal ignorance of
why navies are maintained and of
how they are used to accomplish
their major mission."
A printed pamphlet, issued in be
half of the League over the signa
ture of William Howard Gardiner,
president of the civilian organiza
tion which represents much of the
navy sentiment for more powerful
armament, carried this .statement
with an expression of regret.
"It has been necessary, however,
to say what has been said above,
if we are to have a real apprecia
tion of the impelling motives back
of President Hoover's efforts, at
every turn, to restrict, to reduce, and
to starve the United States Navy—
under the present plea of budget
limitation on which we may have
further cause to comment."
The "abysmal ignorance" attrib
uted to Hoover was said to have
been shown in his proposal to im
munize sea-borne food supplies dur
ing time of war.
"Acceptance of his suggestion
would have worked not only dia
metrically counter to the interests
and weight of the United States in
world affairs, but, in effect, would
have made for bigger and bloodier
wars," Gardiner added. "And yet
such is the psychology that is not
only controlling our internal naval
policy, but dictating its external
subordination to those of foreign
naval powers."
