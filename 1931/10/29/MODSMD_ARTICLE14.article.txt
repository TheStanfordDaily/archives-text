# CAMPUS ACTORS PLAY TOMORROW
## Converse And Gantner To Take Leading Roles 
### 
There arc a number of good
scats for "Berkeley Square" still
on sale at the Old Union and at
Kecble's in Palo Alto. An un
usually large block of seats have
been priced at $1 for this pro
duction.

Headed by Peg Randall Converse
and Vallejo Gantncr, a brilliant cast
! will be seen in "Berkeley Square"
! tomorrow night. John Balderston's
! comedy will be the first of this
year's presentations by the Dramatic
Council.
One of the most versatile and ac
! complished actresses ever to play
on the Stanford stage Peg Converse
j will, in this role, have an entirely
j different type of characterization to
J portray. She is here a wistful, sensi
j tive girl, an interpretation quite for
eign to her usual whimsical comic
parts.
Scenes Dramatic
Endowed with a startling insight
i into the future Helen Pettigrew has
| the courage to send her lover back
j from her world of yesteryear into
I the bustle and hurry of the modern
J day. Her lines, "You've your life
! to live out in the future, Peter. Don't
I be too sad there about a girl who's
I been dead for so long," are some
| of the most impressive in the play.
Again and again interest will cen
j ter on scenes involving only these
' two individuals, the girl of the past
and Vallejo Gantner as Peter Stan-
I dish, the dreamy modern, projected
i into a past existence.
Roinanccr Blunders
While assuming his ancestor's per
i sonality, this romancer finds himself
] making blunder after blunder. He
is considered a wit and master of
epigram by his relatives of 1784
I even though his sentences contain
I only the most commonplace of to
-1 day's platitudes. He, is liked yet
feared by those who cannot under
stand him.
This play is well deserving of the
i comment made by the London Times
| when it said, "There is magic in this
' play, enough to set it apart from
I the common traffic of the theatre,
; and to send dreams scudding in iho
| wake of dreams. Therefore, first of
j all, let us welcome and rejoice in it,
! for magic is very rare."
