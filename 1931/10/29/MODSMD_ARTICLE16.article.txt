# Big Red Machine Grinds Secretly Behind Barriers
## Pop Warner Sends Varsity Through Long Scrimmage; Prospect Exists That Second String Is Being Polished For U.C.L.A. Struggle PHIL MOFFATT TO BE READY FOR ACTION AT L.A. Neill and Doub at Ends Should Be Part of Show in Stadium Saturday; Rintala at Fullback Position 
### STEWART CRAWFORD 
"Well, the boys scrimmaged tonight.''
That, in effect, is what Don E. Liebcndorfcr, news director, told your
correspondent concerning varsity practice yesterday evening.
"Yes, the boys scrimmaged," said Don. "They scrimmaged for something
like three quarters of an hour."
Now, since wc must depend entirely for our material upon what Mr.
Liebcndorfcr tells us. we gather that Pop Warner sent the boys through
a stiff scrimmage amid a dark shroud of secrecy within the confines of
the high green fence of the varsity practice lot.
What went on inside that high green fence can be nothing short of
pure conjecture, so it is natural that we, as well as the guy next door,
demand the right to put in a guess. A headline in the San Francisco

Examiner this morning informed lis
that the Indians were holding secret
practice for the U.C.L.A. contest
Saturday.
Granting that cur contemporary
was right, we would expect Pop's
eleven to blossom out here Saturday
with a lot of new aspects of Warner
wizadry, fourble reverses and such.
Shock Starters
But alas, we cannot believe that
: such will be the case. Against the
Bruins we suspect that "shock
troops" will be starting, that they
will not only start the contest, but
j will remain in the game throughout
sixty minutes of football unless
Coach Spaulding's men become out
right unruly and attempt to do what
;it has been proved that they cannot
do—upset the Indians.
Straight football will be the order
1 for the Indians, and if they use any
thing but line bucks, forward
| passes, and the single reverse, we
j shall not write any more of this
I blurb for the Daily.

What, you may ask, is the object
of the secrecy, if the boys are not
preparing some deep stuff for the
Uclans Saturday? Well, if you are
that dumb, Mr. Fan, you deserve to
be fooled. If you are that dumb, wc
must go on to explain that Stanford
University meets the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles
on November 7.
Though it may be running our
guess privilege into the ground to
predict what we have in mind, wc
suspect that the Old Fox is doing
double duty these days.
By double duty, we mean that he
is possibly coaching two teams in
stead of one—bringing a second
and third-string outfit around for
the Westwood invaders, and shaping
up his varsity outfit for the Trojans
the following week.
Probable Line-ups
Now, to play further on what we
admit to be nothing more than j
hypothesis, we will venture just far
enough to name the separate teams,
and then stop. •

In the Stadium Saturday you may
look for something like the follow
ing outfit to start:

Ends, Neill and Doub; tackles,
Johnston and N. Gray; guards,
Scribner and Dohrmann; center,
McLeod; halfbacks, Hardy and Wil
son; quarterback, Targhctta; full
back, Rintala.

Against Troy on November 7 there
is little doubt that the Old Man will
start Colvin and Tod at ends, Hand
and Ehrhorn at tackles; Corbus and
Bigelow at guards; Milligan, cen
ter; Hillman, quarterback; Moffatt
and Caddell, halves; and Dusty Al
len, fullback.

That, in effect, is what Don E. Liebcndorfcr, news director, told your
correspondent concerning varsity practice yesterday evening.
"Yes, the boys scrimmaged," said Don. "They scrimmaged for something
like three quarters of an hour."
Now, since wc must depend entirely for our material upon what Mr.
Liebcndorfcr tells us. we gather that Pop Warner sent the boys through
a stiff scrimmage amid a dark shroud of secrecy within the confines of
the high green fence of the varsity practice lot.
What went on inside that high green fence can be nothing short of
pure conjecture, so it is natural that we, as well as the guy next door,
demand the right to put in a guess. A headline in the San Francisco

Examiner this morning informed lis
that the Indians were holding secret
practice for the U.C.L.A. contest
Saturday.
Granting that cur contemporary
was right, we would expect Pop's
eleven to blossom out here Saturday
with a lot of new aspects of Warner
wizadry, fourble reverses and such.
Shock Starters
But alas, we cannot believe that
: such will be the case. Against the
Bruins we suspect that "shock
troops" will be starting, that they
will not only start the contest, but
j will remain in the game throughout
sixty minutes of football unless
Coach Spaulding's men become out
right unruly and attempt to do what
;it has been proved that they cannot
do—upset the Indians.
Straight football will be the order
1 for the Indians, and if they use any
thing but line bucks, forward
| passes, and the single reverse, we
j shall not write any more of this
I blurb for the Daily.

What, you may ask, is the object
of the secrecy, if the boys are not
preparing some deep stuff for the
Uclans Saturday? Well, if you are
that dumb, Mr. Fan, you deserve to
be fooled. If you are that dumb, wc
must go on to explain that Stanford
University meets the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles
on November 7.
Though it may be running our
guess privilege into the ground to
predict what we have in mind, wc
suspect that the Old Fox is doing
double duty these days.
By double duty, we mean that he
is possibly coaching two teams in
stead of one—bringing a second
and third-string outfit around for
the Westwood invaders, and shaping
up his varsity outfit for the Trojans
the following week.
Probable Line-ups
Now, to play further on what we
admit to be nothing more than j
hypothesis, we will venture just far
enough to name the separate teams,
and then stop. •

In the Stadium Saturday you may
look for something like the follow
ing outfit to start:

Ends, Neill and Doub; tackles,
Johnston and N. Gray; guards,
Scribner and Dohrmann; center,
McLeod; halfbacks, Hardy and Wil
son; quarterback, Targhctta; full
back, Rintala.

Against Troy on November 7 there
is little doubt that the Old Man will
start Colvin and Tod at ends, Hand
and Ehrhorn at tackles; Corbus and
Bigelow at guards; Milligan, cen
ter; Hillman, quarterback; Moffatt
and Caddell, halves; and Dusty Al
len, fullback.
