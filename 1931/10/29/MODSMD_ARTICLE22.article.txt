# ILLEGAL RUSHING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
## 
### 
True to cxpectalions the Intcrfraternitv Hoard ot Con
trol instigated a campaign to stump out illegal rushing at
a meeting last Tuesday night. The chairman of the Hoard
made an appeal to the fraternities to abide by the rushing
rules, and the machinery for dealing with the offenders
was oiled up and put in running condition.
The results of this enforcement campaign are easy to
see. Kithcr the attempt to enforce the rules will fall flat
and illegal rushing will continue as it has in the past to the
benefit of all concerned or illegal rushing will be ettce
lively curtailed and the advantages of the rushing system
;;s if has been carried on formerly will be lost.
Peculiar as it may seem, the rushing system at Stanford
is lousy in theory but excellent in practice. This is so be
cause the fraternity men are wise enough to see that it is
only by breaking the rushing rules, by the aid ol illegal
rushing, that the plan can work out in actuality, as was
described in a Daily editorial in an earlier issue.
Were the absurd rules of no rushing until spring quar
ter strictly adhered to the freshmen would be ignorant of
the fraternities and the row men would know practically
nothing about the freshmen. The spring period would de
generate into the knock-down-drag-out system practiced
at other institutions and a wise choice on the part of either
the freshmen or fraternities would be impossible.

Illcf/al rusliiiifj is absolutely necessary. It must, of
course, be kept illegal if the advantages of the deferred
system of pledging are to be realized. I herein lie the
duties of the Interfraternity Hoard of Control. It should
not foolishly try to stop all illegal rushing, thereby upset
ting the nicely working system of past years.

Perhaps this campaign is only a bluff on the pari of the
Board to keep this rushing illegal. Hut if the Hoard seri
ously intends to enforce the rules to the letter, it is directly
working against the best interests of the fraternities, whose
welfare is the onlv reason for the board's existence.
