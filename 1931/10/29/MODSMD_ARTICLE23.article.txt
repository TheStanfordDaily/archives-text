A lot of ink has been consumed and a lot of words have
been given public attention in the would-be controversy
between Palo Alto and University officials over the "is
lands" in the intersection of University Avenue, Palm
Drive, and El Oamino Real and, so far, little seems to have
been accomplished. There have been as many separate
ideas advanced as there have been contributors to forum
and opinion columns in the* papers. *
Monday representatives of the University will meet
with members of the city council of Palo Alto, the board
of public works, and the board of public safely to consider
the development of the plans that have been offered by
tin- University.
The matter has not yet reached the dignity of a real
controversy, but it must be handled co-operatively and
with care ultimately to work out a satisfactory solution to
the problem. Meanly, utility, and safety, with emphasis on
Ihe last two items, are factors of primary importance in
designing the gateway to Palo Alto and to Stanford I'ni
