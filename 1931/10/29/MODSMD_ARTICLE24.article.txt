A I'nilcd Press survey recently bronchi lo Iil»111 the lael|
licit college men and women are culling their social budg
ets lo til the depression pattern. Individual dates as well
as university dances are suffering drastic economic reduc-
I ions.
What of the situation here? The women still frantically
fii»111*i11 ,«>* out ways and means of bigger and better gold
digging. Movie prices have not been reduced, and in spite
of the fact that gasoline is cheap, rented cars are as ex-;
pensive as in the days of plenty. Varsity dances make the
poor college man dig deep into his pocket, and cokes still
cost a nickel.
Something should be done. University women receive
an allowance as high as that of the average college man.
One of two things must happen: either the women must
voluntarily agree to reduce their demands upon their es
corts, or they must dig deep into their vanities and help the
financially embarrassed soul by paying half the bill.
Such an arrangement as the latter would be a hardship
lo no one. If il were accepted as customary on the Mill as
a temporary relief measure, no embarrassment need en
sue. Students could at least give it a try.
If the women will not agree to either of the two plans
suggested, the men should try boycotting the damsels.
'I hink what fun il would be lo say, "Sorry, we are having
no social engagements until an agreeable arrangement is
made."
And il works both ways: No inon, no fun. I iiincrsilij
