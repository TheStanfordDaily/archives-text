# BULL SESSION
## HO! HUM! ILLEGAL RUSHING AGAIN 
### 
Events move in certain, definite i
cycles at Stanford. Year in and year j
out, the same things happen in the j
same way; and people seem to react !

to these same things in the same
old fashion. Once in a while there
is a change; and ihen the campus
leans back and gasps with surprise
that the old order has passed. This
quarter will be notable in many re
spects. It looks like the gates will
reach their final completion this
autumn if present prognostications
can be relied upon. The Honor Code
has had its customary revival; but it
seems to be the real thing this quar
ter.
The usual move on the part of
the Interfraternity Council was ex
pected; arid the student body was
not disappointed. True to form, a
move to ban illegal rushing was
again instigated, or more properly,
stated at Tuesday's meeting. Wheth
er this present outbreak is genuine
or not, this writer does not know.
But if this year's Interfraternity
Council has deliberately foisted an
other so-called or inis-called cam
paign upon the campus with no
more intention of doing anything
than in previous years, then the
students are justified in wondering
why the Council doesn't finally de
velop a sense of humor.
Year after year, the Council
seems to feel that some move must
be made to show that illegal rush
ing has not yet received official
sanction. If they didn't do that, some
of the frosh were apt to believe,
that illegal rushing is a misnomer—
so prevalent is this active custom.
And no one can deny that this es
teemed body has fulfilled this func
tion; in the midst of wholesale rush
ing before the legal period—so open

I that even outsiders could detect it
I without even trying to snoop—the
i traditional statement against these
practices has always been forthcom-
I ing
| But it is not wholly justified in
1 condemning the present Council for
i what past ones did and failed to do.
i Perhaps the present one has a genu-
I ine desire to stamp out this estub
j lished custom. If it has any desire,
I it is fairly certain that it will be
i relatively easy to satisfy their crav
i ing. Last year it almost became so
; obnoxious that early retirers near
Toyon's magazine room often had a
difficult time in getting to sleep be
' cause of the noisy felicitations be
i tween How hunters and Encina prey.
To punish all guilty houses by re
i traction of pledging privileges
i would, according to some Row men,
! practically he tantamount to hand-
I ing over the entire Frosh class to
! the clubs. If the Men's Council were
|to try infractions of the rushing
! rules, there is little doubt that there
! would be more enforcement than
|there has been in the past; but to
i ask Row men to submit their per
| sonal troubles to a body consisting
1 in part of Hail men has as much
chance of passing as the proposal to
' let the Abyssinian parliament pass
1 laws for this nation —if there is an
\ Abyssinian parliament.
The members of the Class of '35
| should realize that to be caught
J being entertained by a fraternity
1 before it is legal, makes them
; guilty and liable to the loss of
! pledging privileges for this year, as
! well as the House involved. The
I freshman should consider, "If I am
desirable illegally, why shouldn't I
be desirable legally?" Take your
| time, frosh, there is no hurry.
