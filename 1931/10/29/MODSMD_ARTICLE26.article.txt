TONIGHT OR NEVER—At the Cur
ran Theatre, San Francisco.
Calmly and sincerely we pro
nounce this the most entertaining
play we have seen produced in four
years of attendance at San Francisco
theatres. An excellent plot handled
with extraordinary deftness, a cast
which is almost flawless in its rep
resentation of detailed characteriza
tions, artistic staging—all contribute
materially to this outstanding suc
cess of the season thus far.

Helen Gahagan, aside from being
a very attractive woman, has a
magnificent voice. And never for
an instant does she lapse from her
role—that of a temperamental prima
donna longing for some private ex
citement, for something more thrill
ing than the public, insincere devo
tion of a conceited European noble
man.

Her accompanist, "The Faithful
Dog," as played by Ferdinand Gott
schalk, is clever and loveable and
quite a necessity to the success of
the production. Warburton Gamble
and Anthony Bushell, of movie
fame prove themselves equal io
any strenuous occasion, one as iho
flighty aristocrat, the other as the
handsome hero who is famous but
not. too sophisticated to have shat
terable illusions.
The most striking thing, I think,
was the fact that these stage musi
cians could really play and sing—
no electric buttons to press, or any
thing. Very emphatically a play to
be seen. —M.L.J.
THE CISCO KID—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Remember Warner Baxter in "Old
Arizona," billed at the time as the
"first outdoor all-talkie"? He's back

again as the Cisco Kid, one of his
most delightful characterizations, in
a flicker of the same name now un
reeling at the Now Stanford.
Edmund Lowe is again the hard
boiled border patrol sergeant, bat
tling with Baxter this time for a
newcomer, Conchita Montenegro.
It's an old story but cleverly
done. Honors go to Baxter, with
Miss Montenegro proving alluring.
Nora Lane shines in a small part.
—M.C.

THE BACHELOR FATHER—At (lie
Varsity Theatre.
Obvious from the start, this banal
story of a bachelor who brings up
a little orphan, and falls in love
with her when she grows to be a
beautiful young girl, nevertheless is
redeemed by the charm of Paul
Lukas and Dorothy Jordan, and the
quaint, lovely comedy of Charles
Ruggles.
The closing scenes reveal that
Paul Lukas has a gift for humor
which you did not suspect of this
self-possessed, distinguished man.
However, the picture is not a worthy
vehicle for the talents of this actor.
It is light and entertaining, and has
appealing moments, but on the
whole it is rather trivial.
