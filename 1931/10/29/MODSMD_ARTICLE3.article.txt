## Women To Debate U.C. On Alimony Question 
### 
Discussion of the exact wording
of the subject for the debate with
California took the place of the
usual business at the meeting of the
Women's debate squad last evening.

"Resolved, that present-day ali
mony laws are unfair to the men,"
was the final phrasing decided upon
by the women. The women of the
University of California approved
the subject today.

, The general subject, "Marriage
and Divorce," had already been
chosen as a basis for all the debates
of the Women's Pacific Forensic
League. The debate with California
will be a two evening affair. Stan
ford will uphold the affirmative -on
the question here on November 30
and the negative at California on
December 1.

Professor James G. Emerson,
women's debate coach, announces
that the squad will meet twice a
week for practice in informal de
bates of the question. A meeting will
be held this afternoon at 1 o'clock
in Emerson's office.
