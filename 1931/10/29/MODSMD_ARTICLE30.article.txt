LOVE IN THE DEPRESSION
j My lips should sing, my heart should
upfling,
When I see your lovely face
| As side by side where the movies
slide
We see the stars embrace.
i My eyes should gleam with a joyous
beam
j When you swallow my earnest
line,
' Or smiling our signs in each other's
eyes
We order our meat and wine.

| But my pocketbook sags and my
checking account drags
And if I were a girl I'd pout,
j So I'll sadly resign and put up a
sign—
j "Gone Bankrupt—Love Forced Me
Out."
Excerpt from a story in "Best
I News Stories of 1924" says:
"The man's left arm was missing
above the wrist."
The bloke who wrote that must
have hud his head missing below
the scalp.
j In the big rush to educate the dear
; public the national broadcasting
i systems are adopting culture. Now
j we can listen to one edifying talk
! each week, and it is reported that a
| Stanford professor of psychology
I will lecture. No doubt it. will be
| like this:
"Good evening, ladies and gentle
j ment. This evening, through the
j courtesy of Stanford University,
j manufacturers of Stanford men and
i women and presidents, you will have
i the rare opportunity of hearipg Pro
j fessor Whoozis talk on modern psy
j pscho—just a minute—psychology,
| that's the word, folks, psychology.
| Now what's the exact title of your
j talk, professor? Oh, yes, psychology
of the modern woman. So the mod
ern woman has a psychology, proffy.
Ha, that's good. I'll bet Andy would
be regusted to hear that, Proffy.
1 Well, folks, let me introduce you to
the Professor from Stanford. Every
body knows that Stanford produces
I superior men and women, 1 hat's
why they can't get jobs. Alright—"
