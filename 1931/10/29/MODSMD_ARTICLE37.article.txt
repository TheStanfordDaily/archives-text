(This fanaticism of the Five
Hundred to get into intercolle
giate athletics got a break in
the Daily office today, in a jour
nalistic sense. Our feature edi
tor wanted lo go sport—and she
went in today's column.—Sports
Ed.)
Slants attended secret practice !
yesterday—thereby scooping every i
sports reporter on the coast. A gal- '
lant "Pop" Warner himself un-~
locked the narrow gate of the prac
tice field, growling at the startled ;
gate-keeper lo stand back, that this j
was only "a scout from U.S.C."
Don Liebendorfer, slipping in to i
watch the ultra-secret scrimmage a J
little later, was horrified to find us |
sitting on the grass in cozy confab j
with the grid managers, and mak- '
ing careful notations on a scrap of
copy paper.
"Your head is in your own
hands!" warned the scandalized
Stanford Public Relations Coun
cil, remembering a California
feiuinc who put the Golden Bear
in jeopardy several years ago by
chatting about some secret plays.
Besides a good look at certain i
umphty-umph kind of plays, and i
interesting gyrations by certain un- ;
mentionable players, the following
data was garnered from the oh, so
secret practice:
—Thai Wallace Denny is the
best drop-kicker on the squad.
—That liigelow is the cham
peen dice-shaker, having won a
young fortune on the home
hound Shasta Limited by shak
ing mil a never-ending pair of
fours.
—That line MeLeod's trick
knee goes out of commission in
the cool night air, about sun
down, and lie can't get it unbent
until the next forenoon.
—That the practice field is simply
swell—(just try and see it!) —on
these moonlight evenings, during
practice, when a big white moon
swings up over the fence, and paling !
the Hood lights, bathes the tired
players in eerie brilliance.
Secret practice is delightfully in- j
formal as to dress. The fancy pep- I
permint suits are laid by for Satur- !
day games. On a go or 1 Wednesday |
afternoon, it is a-la-niode for half I
the squad to wear sloppy grey sweat j
shirts, and the rest don a weather- i
beaten red Goof, this to foster an- I
lagonism between forces.
A few free-thinking souls
strike new fashion notes. Shoul- !
der guards worn sans shirt add j
a futuristic touch, with the bam
boo pads clapping like castanets.
Best of all, the inevitably -
Pliancy Phil MolTatt pranced in ,
late, clad in flapping pajamas, j
and went off to play hall by
himself in one corner.
Just to show no partiality, let it j
be said that we personally inter- j
viewed the crack polo-pony of Cap- j
tain Gordan's remuda. This likeable I
bay pony, 14 hands high, is a "self- j
made" horse. With never a moment's j
coaching, and scarred by all sorts ,
of knock-about riding before com
ing to Stanford, he has since played J
first-string polo for three years, is [
fast, clever, and good at jumping |
besides. His name is withheld for ;
fear of tempting the military roughs j
who take Hoble out riding on Sun- ,
days.
Well, SLANTS for a day!
