# DUNCAN CHIEF BACKFIELD THREAT OF UCLANS, SAYS BRUIN WRITER
## 
### HAROLD KEEN 
Sports Editor, California Daily Bruin
Coach Bill Spaulding has a real
problem on his hands in the
U.C.L.A. backfield for the Indian
game. Of course they ran up 4G
points against Pomona last Satur
day, but that was no indication of
their real ability. Against strong op
ponents the backfield combination
has failed to show anything, al
though individually it has some very
' capable men.
Captain Norm Duncan is the
standout in the Bruin backfield. He
is the only one of the ball packers
I who has flashed anything against
major opposition. His defensive play
was the cause of, much comment
j both in the Northwestern and
i Washington State games. What
yardage the Bruins gained in these
battles was chiefly that gained by
Duncan. He also punts and passes
I and constitutes a serious triple
I threat.
Two Good Quarters
I The quarterback choice switches
I from Lenny Bergdahl to Johnny
j Fletcher and back again as Bill
i Spaulding attempts to find a capable
; field general. Bergdahl is steady but
; conservative; Fletcher, fiery but in
j experienced. Bergdahl has the ad
j vantage in passing; Fletcher the odds
I in ball packing. Both will get a
j break against Stanford.
Joe Keeble and Bobby Decker ap
: pear certain to start at the halfback
j posts. Keeble is a sophomore, tricky
| with his feet, fair as a passer, and
\ a good punter. He intercepted a
pass against Northwestern which
i got the Bruins down to the Purple
| 10-yard line. That has been his out
j standing piece of work this year;
I otherwise he has shown but little.
Decker Threatens
j Decker, however, is a real threat,
j He can match punts with Duncan
| and is dangerous on runs from fake
! kick formation. When right, Decker
is unstoppable.

' There should be other Bruins who
will flash their wares at Palo Alto
| Saturday besides these. There is
Howard Roberts, the best punter
: of the lot, who may be called in to
supplant Keeble. There is Bob Hen
dry, an alert defensive player, who
! may take over Decker's berth. In
the closing stages of the game, fans
| can look for Aubrey Grossman to
j replace Duncan and tear the center
\ of the line to shreds.
Battle Expected
On the line, Les Haight or Bill
Maxwell will take care of one end
if Mulhapt fails to start. Kearns
Hampton, a hardworking boy, may
break in at one of the tackles.
| ' Spec" Haslam may be given the
! choice over Austin at guard. Oliver
j will undoubtedly be in the game at
center, but Lee Coates, a real comer,
! will get into the fray before it is
' over.
I In this line-up, Bill Spaulding be
[ lieves he has the material to give
| Stanford a real battle, if not to win
i over the Red team. Whether he is
I right, only Saturday's results can
tell.
Hyland's Relation Told
Further explanation of "Tricky
' Dick" Hyland's alleged "switch of
allegiance" from Stanford to U.C.L.A.
was contained in the following tele
{ gram from S. W. Cunningham, grad
j uate manager of the southern in-
I stitution:
j Los Angeles, Calif.
! Alfred R. Masters
; Stanford University, Calif.
Sorry our Bruin sport editor got
j outside in recent article that ap
! peared in your paper. Hyland has
i been unofficially helping our coach
; ing staff off and on but has only
I been out once and that was week
! ago yesterday for few minutes. Since
| we returned from Northwestern has
j not helped us any in preparation
; for game with you. Regret exceed
-1 ingly that his loyalty to Stanford

| has been misrepresented because
i there is no foundation in statement
! made in article. You may publish
! this statement. Regards.
