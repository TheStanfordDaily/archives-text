# EASTMAN EXHIBITS OLD FIRE IN TIME TRIAL YESTERDAY
## Quarter Mile Ticked Off In 48.2 In Benâ€™s First Trial Of Season 
### 
Ben Eastman, intercollegiate half
mile champion and co-holder of the
world's quarter-mile run record,
I served notice on local track fans
that he would take up this year right
i where he left off last spring, when
he raced 440 yards in 48.2 seconds
yesterday afternoon, in a time trial
without competition.
Although Eastman set a terrific
i pace for the first three hundred
l yards, and finished in good style,
j Coach "Dink"' Templeton indicated
that the run might have been even
! faster, had Eastman used a better
| body lean.
j Yesterday's time trial was East
' man's first lull quarter of the year,
j as he had confined himself to the
i shorter dashes in earlier meets,
i Eastman's best time last spring was
j 47.4, a mark which he made in de-
I feating Vic Williams, star Southern
| California runner, in the California
1 Inlercollegiates.
The practice was featured by sev
eral other good performances. Bob
Atkinson's 4:41 in the mile run was
, particularly pleasing to Templeton,
j as well as Ralph Giberson's time of
1 10.1. in the 100-yard dash.
