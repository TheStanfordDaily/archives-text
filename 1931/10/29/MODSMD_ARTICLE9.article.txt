# BABES WORK ON TACKLING GAME
## Bradshaw Thinks Win Will Give Frosh Spirit 
### Spud Hamilton 
Heavy workouts are in order for
the Stanford freshman football men
this week, with charging practice
and tackling being particularly
stressed. The tackling of the Car
dinal ends and secondary men was
not of the best last Saturday in the
Trobabe game and Coach Bradshaw
will require emphasis on these fun
damentals before the clash with
Moran School Saturday.

In future games referees will not
be too hasty with their decisions if
Coach Bradshaw has any influence
with the whistling tooting gentry. In
the contest at Los Angeles the for
ward lateral pass worked to perfec
tion, and netted 55 yards and an ap
parent touchdown, only to be re
called when the referee ruled that
he had sounded his whistle before
the lateral pass had been made. That
decision hurt the Indians. A brilliant
touchdown run would have injected
some fight and spirit into the year
lings and would have made their
record on paper look a lot better.

An impressive trouncing of the
invading Moran team on Saturday
would be an aid to the Stanford
Babe's psychological atitude. The
recent series of defeats has badly
cieplcled their reserve of spirit and
a victory for a change might infuse
the freshmen with the winning
habit.

The Commonweaith of Australia
is one of the most progressive and
democratic states in the world.
