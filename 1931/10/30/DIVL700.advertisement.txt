humor —the new school I
In the past few years a new American type of humor
has gained well-deserved popularity. It seems to have Paul Busch
had its inspiration in "The New Yorker." Based on q Soglov/
satiric observation of the foibles of human nature, it
pokes gentle fun at folk we know—and are. It is a Donkel
welcome departure from the "wise-cracking" of another Jay Jrving
day or the strained "fun" dependent upon gymnastics
of dialect that our worthy grandparents were fed on.

humor —the new school I
In the past few years a new American type of humor
has gained well-deserved popularity. It seems to have Paul Busch
had its inspiration in "The New Yorker." Based on q Soglov/
satiric observation of the foibles of human nature, it
pokes gentle fun at folk we know—and are. It is a Donkel
welcome departure from the "wise-cracking" of another Jay Jrving
day or the strained "fun" dependent upon gymnastics
of dialect that our worthy grandparents were fed on.
