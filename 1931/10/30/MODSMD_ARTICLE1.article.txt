# CONVERSE AND GANTNER PLAY LEADS TONIGHT
## Dramatic Council Presents "Berkeley Square" In Assembly Hall PLAY BEGINS AT 8:15 Intense Drama, Whimsical Humor Portrayed 
### 
The delicate charm of John Bal- j
derston's drama, "Berkeley Square," j
will be presented to Stanford play- |
goers tonight when the curtain is
drawn at 8:15 o'clock for the first
Dramatic Council production of the
year. Harold Helvenston is directing (
the play which bids fair to rival the
triumph of "Wings Over Europe" in ,
smoothness of presentation.
On Vallejo Gantner's interpreta- |
tion of Peter Standish will hinge :
much of tonight's success or failure, j
He is carrying a difficult part, one j
which requires true dramatic in- j
sight and characterization to por- I
tray.
Converse Charming
Playing opposite Gantner, Peg !
Converse, as Helen Pettigrew, can I
be relied upon to give what will !
probably be one of the finest per- 1
formances of the evening. With her '
natural dramatic ability aided by
previous experience on the stage, !
she is undoubtedly the most fin
ished actress in the cast.
This play will appeal to diverse
tastes for it combines intensely dra
matic moments with whimsically '
humorous scenes. "Berkeley Square" J
has been compared to such plays |
as, "Death Takes a Holiday," and 1
"Hotel Universe," modern dramas
which present an underlying philo- \
sophical thought as well as con- I
structed action and plot.
Sandoc Plays Humor
One of the most humorous of
characters, the meek Throstle, will I
introduce Jim Sandoe to campus
audiences. He is remarkably well
chosen and in rehearsals has been j
doing excellent work. He is closely
rivalled by Dorothy Tully, an actrcss 1
who, although appearing in her first i
major lead tonight has had consider- j
able experience in minor parts.
Ed Girzi is one of the best cast ]
of the entire group if ability to
make his part seem himself can be
taken as a criterion. There is an 1
easy naturalness throughout all his
scenes.
Charmingly convincing as the at
tractive Duchess of Devonshire, !
Barbara Collins has some of the
best lines of the play and is sure to
be well liked by the audience. Lady ;
Anne, played by Catherine Crary, is
the bustling arranger whose schemes
often seem doomed to failure and j
yet who manages triumphantly to ,
accomplish her desires.
Minor Roles
Minor roles are being played by |
Terrence Gcddis, the most gallant J
of majors, and Jaqucline de Wit, i
who is the girl with whom the mod
ern Peter is supposed to be in love. ;
Kathleen Hatfield is making one of j
the most charming of maids.
Another unusually well-chosen j
actor will be found in Don Camp- !
bell, who is playing the congenial j
and sympathetic ambassador. As I
Lord Stanley, David Dickey is giv
ing the same fine performance which 1
made him outstanding in "Wings I
Over Europe." The entire cast has
been chosen not only for their abil- !
ity but for their adaptability in
characterization.
There are a few good seats still
on sale which may be bought at
Keeble's in Palo Alto or at the Old |
Union. An unusually large block of
Si scats have been set aside for this !
performance.
