# WRESTLERS TRAINING FOR FIRST MATCHES
## 
### 
With "Hamie" Budge and A1
James, of the 125-pound and 135-
pound classes respectively, still
shaping up as the best material on
the squad, according to Coach Ted
Hill, wrestling is steadily going on
the upward grind. Every day is
spent in perfecting old holds and
acquiring new ones.
Although 110 regular matches have
been held as yet, Coach Hill stated
that the men get a thorough work
out every period and are anxiously
awaiting (he series of elimination
matches, to be held in the winter
quarter.
