# COUNCILS PASS JOINT RESOLVE ON HONOR CODE
## Move Is Toward Greater Respect For System, Claim Members 
### 
Taking the first steps to "encour
age a more respectful attitude on
the part of the student body toward
the honor code" the men and
women's councils in joint session
last night adopted the following
resolution:
"If in an examination a council
member should see a violation of
the honor code it will be considered
his duty to arise and inform the
class, and declare that the viola
tors) should not turn in the
paper(s), since so doing will furnish
grounds for the preferment of
charges of cheating."
Demonstrate Faith
"The councils are doing this to
demonstrate their faith in the honor
code and the student body," said
Milton Hand, chairman of the Men's
Council, "and to set an example, to
prove that we are willing to make
the first move."
"Unless such steps are taken by
the students themselves, declared
Don Colvin, council member, the
University authorities will institute
the proctor system instead of the
honor code which now exists. Such
a step as the reversion to the proc
tor system would be such a back
ward move as could not be toler
ated under our present ideals. We
now have the matter entirely in our
hands, and it is up to us to show
that we are capable of handling it.
Duty of Council
"It is not in the least the desire
of the councils to play upon their
own standing, but we feel it is the
plain duty of the members to take
this step."
Ed Boyles, secretary of the coun
cil, in commenting on the action,
said: "There is no corrective influ
ence in the councils themselves —
when a student reaches that point
he is practically through. The idea
is to get right down into the class
room and check the violations at
their beginnin.
Not Despots
"We do not wish to be petty des
pots, but wish to be fair to all
concerned and put the honor code
on the high plane its nam implies."
Hand made a request for faculty
student support in these words: "In
asmuch as the student body has
voted overwhelmingly in favor, of
the Honor Code, the men's and
women's councils assume the stu
dents' support. But the councils feel
that full support has not been forth
coming from the faculty, although
the professors have indicated their
approval. The councils request and
expect faculty co-operation in the
movement for respect and enforce
ment of the code."
Former Resolution
The joint councils last year passed
the following resolution setting "the
punishments for 'honor violations:
"The maximum penalty for the
first violation of the code—giving or
receiving of unpermitted aid in ex
aminations and in all graded aca
demic work—is expulsion from the
University; the minimum penalty
being suspension for three quarters
at the discretion of the councils.
There shall be automatic expulsion
for the second convicted offense."
"We are backing this up to the
letter this year," said Barbara Beach
Thompson, Women's Council chair
man. "The men's and women's coun
cils have guaranteed each other the
fullest co-operation in this work."

of the councils to play upon their
own standing, but we feel it is the
plain duty of the members to take
this step."
Ed Boyles, secretary of the coun
cil, in commenting on the action,
said: "There is no corrective influ
ence in the councils themselves —
when a student reaches that point
he is practically through. The idea
is to get right down into the class
room and check the violations at
their beginnin.
Not Despots
"We do not wish to be petty des
pots, but wish to be fair to all
concerned and put the honor code
on the high plane its nam implies."
Hand made a request for faculty
student support in these words: "In
asmuch as the student body has
voted overwhelmingly in favor, of
the Honor Code, the men's and
women's councils assume the stu
dents' support. But the councils feel
that full support has not been forth
coming from the faculty, although
the professors have indicated their
approval. The councils request and
expect faculty co-operation in the
movement for respect and enforce
ment of the code."
Former Resolution
The joint councils last year passed
the following resolution setting "the
punishments for 'honor violations:
"The maximum penalty for the
first violation of the code—giving or
receiving of unpermitted aid in ex
aminations and in all graded aca
demic work—is expulsion from the
University; the minimum penalty
being suspension for three quarters
at the discretion of the councils.
There shall be automatic expulsion
for the second convicted offense."
"We are backing this up to the
letter this year," said Barbara Beach
Thompson, Women's Council chair
man. "The men's and women's coun
cils have guaranteed each other the
fullest co-operation in this work."

WILMINGTON, 111., Oct. 29 (/I 1 ). —
The First National Bank of Wil
mington was robbed of $25,000 by
two men who entered the bank to
day, tied the hands of two employes,
looted safe and cash drawers, and
escaped.
Taking the first steps to "encour
age a more respectful attitude on
the part of the student body toward
the honor code" the men and
women's councils in joint session
last night adopted the following
resolution:
"If in an examination a council
member should see a violation of
the honor code it will be considered
his duty to arise and inform the
class, and declare that the viola
tors) should not turn in the
paper(s), since so doing will furnish
grounds for the preferment of
charges of cheating."
Demonstrate Faith
"The councils are doing this to
demonstrate their faith in the honor
code and the student body," said
Milton Hand, chairman of the Men's
Council, "and to set an example, to
prove that we are willing to make
the first move."
"Unless such steps are taken by
the students themselves, declared
Don Colvin, council member, the
University authorities will institute
the proctor system instead of the
honor code which now exists. Such
a step as the reversion to the proc
tor system would be such a back
ward move as could not be toler
ated under our present ideals. We
now have the matter entirely in our
hands, and it is up to us to show
that we are capable of handling it.

of the councils to play upon their
own standing, but we feel it is the
