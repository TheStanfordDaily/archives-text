# STEEPLEJACK IN RESCUE ACT AS CATS FLEE DOG
## 
### 
A bit of life's irony touched
the Daily office yesterday, with
results which totalled 19
scratches, four handsful of fur,
one scraped leg, and several
bent Jimbs.
Campus Steeplejack lan Rid
ley appeared yesterday after
noon to ask if the Daily had
any flagpoles to be painted. To
the Editor, whom he found
pouring milk for the Daily's
four office cats, Ridley extolled
his virtues as an agile climber
of tall poles, and offered stafl
shinnying experiences of the
past summer as proof.
Suddenly there was a four
square hiss from the cats, and
furry bodies shot away like
projectiles. Ridley's big dog
had blundered onto the jour
nalistic mousers at their milk.
The Editor, surveying his
feline proteges, who clung in
panic to the top of a tall Mon
terey pine, turned grimly to
Ridley and said: "You're hired."
