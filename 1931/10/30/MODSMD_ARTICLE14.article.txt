# FAMOUS SINGER ONCE CHORISTER
## Grace Moore, Prima Donna, Here Tuesday night 
### 
From a singer in the choir of the
little Baptist church in her home ,
town of Jellicoe, Tennessee, to a |
prima donna soprano of the Metro- (
politan Opera Company is the path
traveled by Grace Moore, who will
sing in the Pavilion Tuesday eve- ,
ning, November 3.
Although her success in opera was j
instantaneous and she has enjoyed i
the status of a prima donna from her I
first season with the Metropolitan !
Opera Company in 1928, her stardom
was not achieved without hard work j
and sacrifice. Her study under rec- i
ognized masters was made possible
by her success in musical comedies.
Program Set
But she was not content to stop
with her first success, and has stead- j
ily climbed higher, being now well
known as a concert artist and a |
screen star as well as a prima donna.
Swice her engagement by the Metro- '
politan Opera Company, she has i
achieved particular success in the j
roles of the heart-breaking Mimi in ,
"La Boheme," the ravishing Juliet in I
"Romeo and Juliet," the demure
Marguerite in "Faust," and the love- :
ly Manon in the opera of the same
name. Every summer she devotes to
study in her villa in Cannes, learn- j
ing new operatic roles and new con- j
cert songs, and improving her tech
nique under the guidance of sue-|
cessf.ul teachers of her profession.
