# 'Hashing' Is Traditional Bootstrap At Stanford
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Harvard terms it "waiting table."
! Stanford, in graphic terminology and
j a democratic spirit calls it "hash-
I ing."
Acknowledging the profession as
I a conscious part of campus life,
J Chappie has even scheduled a spe
j cial "hasher's issue" for the spring,
j in which it promises "A laugh with
j this all-important creature, not at
| him, for verily we wait on him as
; he waits on us."
Always a traditional bootstrap by
which men have lifted themselves
I through college tlje world over,
hashing is no less so at Stanford,
where students have been given a
quaint reputation for being rich.
| About nine per cent of the student
body is engaged in this worthy pur
| suit on the Stanford campus. Half
i of these hash along the Row. Only
j 18 of the Five Hundred are allowed
Vto bea raloft the tray, and these are

privileged to Roble dining rooms,
j With the sprinkling of white
-1 coated roughs who furnish spice to
I Roble mealtimes, plus all the hash
ers, bus-boys, and dish-washers who
j staff Encina Commons, Sequoia, the
' Union and th eeating clubs, about
i 280 men are able to enjoy the
j warmth of Stanford who would
; otherwise be sensing the chill of a
i jobless world.
There is a certain esprit d' corps
| aboul the hashing brotherhood. They
retain a professional sense of humor;
and their crest might be the scrap
j ing bowl or Roble "grail." Life is
hurried and full for the hasher; he
I is jerked to his feet three times a
| day by an onrushing meal; and a
| breakfast off, when it comes, is as
j sweet as a whole holiday.
About $302,000 has been paid to
I Stanford hashers in food and sal
! Aries during the last seven years.
