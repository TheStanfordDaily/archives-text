"You wait'li I grow up!*'
That's what the U.C.L.A. Bruin has been heard l<* growl under his
breath the last few years as it dragged itself from gridirons with nary a
victory over a major conference opponent. The Bruin isn't full grown yet,
but Stanford may find it quite a job to subdue the obsterperous young
animal tomorrow. While Pop Warner was working his charges long hours
this week in preparation for a date with the Trojans a week hence,

• of the season—an attempt to grab
I their lirst major conference victory.
Warner has announced a starting
! lineup made up of a new mixture
J of second- and third-string players,
i but has indicated he may not leave
! them in long. Dick Hanley, North -
| yestern coach, started his shock
; troops against the Bruins, but soon
{ had to rush in his regulars. What is
: more, he had to LEAVE them in.
| Fifty-three minutes that North
: western first team played, and was
l held to 19 points. Only three touch
; downs in 53 minutes—and they held

| / '
j Notre Dame to a scoreless tie! That
i Bruin feller has a defense—make no
J mistake about that.
Bruins Lack Offense
i What Spaulding's eleven has failed
| to show so far is a consistent of
j fense. Their attack didn't click at
j all until last week's game with little
; Pomona, when they rolled up some
I 40-odd points, and any offense will
i look good against a weak team. IF
j the Bruins should blossom out with
■an offense tomorrow, they might
i provide a large afternoon for an
I Indian eleven that will be thinking
I of a much more important afternoon
j just a week away.
No, it doesn't look as if to
morrow's affair will be a
"breather," much as one is
needed after a week's work such
as the last has been for the In
! dian squad. But in spite of the
optimism and enthusiasm of the
j Southern rooters, who are ex
pected to invade the Farm to
morrow 1500 strong, it is diffi
cult to concede the Bruins much
; of a chance at actual victory.
I Stanford should win by a couple
i of touchdowns, but it may take the
! varsity to turn the trick. Not that
Pop's starting lineup is so weak.
"Red" Targhctta, who flashed so
brilliantly in the Oregon State game,
will bo at quarter, with Rudy Rin
tala at fullback. Glover and Wilson
draw the halfback assignments, and
! both arc clever boys.
Neill, Grey Return
The line sees the return of Phil
Neill, end, who has been absent
: because of poison oak, and George
Grey, tackle, who has been kept on
the sidelines by a leg injury. The
game should provide the pair with
a needed workout for the Trojan
party.
Doub will be at the other wing
post and Laborde at the other tackle.
Scribner and Dawson will be at
guards and McLeod at ecnter to
complete a forward wall of good
strength.
Howard Jones, mentor of the
Terrible Trojans, will be in the
stands tomorrow to see what he
can see. It is doubtful, however,
if he will he shown any of War
ner's plans for next Saturday's
classic. Jt is certain that the
Old Man has been drilling for
the U.S.C. game this week in
spite of his declarations that he
expected a "tough game" to
morrow, hut practice has been so
secret that he has even blind
folded the Grays when they
went in to scrimmage the var
sity.
Warner again sent the squad
through a scrimmage last night, fol
lowed by signal practice. Moffatt,
Gribben, and Heiser, who are still
troubled by injuries, took part in
the signal drill but not in the scrim
i mage. Moffatt will not be used in
tomorrow's game under any con
sideration.
Bill Spaulding and his Bruins will
arrive from the South on the Lark
this morning and will set up head
quarters at a San Mateo hotel. They
will work out at the Stadium this
afternoon.
