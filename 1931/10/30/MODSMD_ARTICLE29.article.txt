('J'he Daily takes the liberty of reprinting from the cur
rent issue of the Scientific Monthly the following tribute to
Ihe lule David Sturr Jordan, written by President Hay Ly
man Wilbur of the I'nipersiltj.)
Hv a fortunate chance the forces hack of heredity com
bined to endow David Starr Jordan with a great vigorous
body, an eager mind with a poetical turn, and a rare ca
pacity to note and remember form, size and color. Men
like to use their strongest powers. It was natural that* a
man with a love of nature who could remember every
({('tail of structure without visible effort should be a mor
phological zoologist, and just as natural that when his at
tention was turned to fishes that he should become the
( utstanding systematic ichthyologist of his time. Fish are
Ã¼biquitous and of infinite variety. The free course of
stream, Jake and ocean give them wide range. Following
iliem over the world was the great sport of Dr. Jordan. It
icd him to know many countries and men of all nations and
to be a true citizen of the world. Kind, idealistic and sym
pathetic, the woes of others became his woes. From boy
hood he had recoiled from brutality and from that highest
of brutalities that is called war. As he learned more of the
world and its history, war became to him the one major
disease of society. To hold it in check, to fight its ravages,
to work for its eradication, became his master passion.
Trained as a scientist, gifted as a* simple, effective, con
vincing speaker and author, motivated by deep feeling and
conviction, he began to use his facile epigrams, his poetic
powers, his writing instinct and the facts gathered bv a
driving personal industry to marshal the forces of peace.
1 iis ease in friendship, his willingness to travel, his ca
pacity not to see obstacles, made him a world figure in the
struggle for the pacific settlement of international disputes.
It was as a teacher and university administrator that
Dr. .Jordan built his own memorial. Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford had tlie funds, and the general plan of founding a
university, but Dr. Jordan gave Stanford University its life
and purpose. Keen in his judgment of men, tolerant of the
ideas of others, daring in experiment, he struck out for the
best in men and in ideas and pioneered the young institu
tion through prosperity, financial collapse, earthquake and
many deferred hopes.
New thoughts and new plans intrigued him, so that his
best life's work was done in the moulding of a new uni
versity. His love of man, his leadership, his own whole
some life and character, made him a towering figure in
education in California and the nation.
As scientist, internationalist and administrator, lie tlior
oughly enjoyed life and gave inspiration to others, llis
unusual physical endowment carried him clear and un
afraid into his eightieth year, when nature slowly brought
him down, just as a great old oak falls in the forest. Hut
he will live on and on in science, in literature, and in the
hearts of manv thousands who loved him.
