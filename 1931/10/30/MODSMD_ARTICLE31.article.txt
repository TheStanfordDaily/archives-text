Crace Moore, famous opera star and concert soprano,
makes her first appearance on the Stanford campus next
Tuesday evening as the first of the A.S.S.I'. Concert Series'
guest artists. Stanford is indeed fortunate in having the
opportunity to hear this prima donna, and it behooves
those who love music to make the most of this chance.
In the past few years students have taken the excellent
musical productions which arc brought here too much as
a matter of course. They attend a concert sometimes on
the spur of the moment, in the same spirit in which they
attend a movie in town. City audiences reserve tickets
months in advance to hear these same artists. Few mem
bers of college communities anywhere have opportunities
e<[iial to ours, and music should play a very definite part
in an educational system which calls itself at all complete.
Lei Stanford students show this year that they appreciate
cultural opportunities.
