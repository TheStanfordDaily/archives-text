# BULL SESSION
## DAMNED IF HE DOES AND DAMNED IF HE DOESN'T 
### 
The President was faced and is
faced by a deficit that soon looks as ,
if it will meet up to all Democratic
expectations. Every time income tax
returns fail to come in, the deficit
grows with leaps and bounds. Faced
with a deficit, there are only two
things to do—get more money or
spend less. Getting more cash means
raising taxes—and that is one thing
that nobody likes to do, especially 1
before a campaign with a reborn t
Democratic opposition.
Therefore, Hoover tried to do the |
only other thing—cut expenditures. ,
The navy * department was one of
the first to feel the cutting whip of
economy. If Coolidge could become
the patron saint of economy by tak
ing the red stripe out of the mail
bags, there seemed genuine possi
bilities for Hoover. The trouble is
that no one cares about taking the l
red band off the mail bags, except '
the few aesthetically-minded mail '
carriers; however, the genuine i
economies that Hoover is seeking to j
institute are veritable broadsides j
against many powerful groups —,
groups that can raise more noise
than the poor mail clerks who may
have objected to tossing mundane!
gray bags—bags without the en- j
livening power of a bit of red.
Hoover has proposed to cut the 1
navy budget by about $50,000,000. !
Borah came out claiming that this j
was not sufficient in that the Navy j
would still get over 340 million ol' |
the public's pocketbook. The big 1
noise, however, has come from ;
those that not only do not want j
navy cuts, but desire positive in- |
creases. Men like Chairman of the j
House Naval Committee Britten are |
up in the air with loud cries, and
even louder sounds are being heard i

from California's own Senator
"Japan-is-threatening-U.S." John
son.
When it comes to a fearless and
progressive stand on so-called do
mestic issues, Johnson is always in
! the fighting vanguard. On some
matters, however, such as national
defense, he is much too rabid to
please those, like this writer, who
feej that Vanity Fair was justified
; in calling Shortridge second best
! Senator from California.
The United States has no far
' flung colonial empire whose defense
is absolutely vital to national ex
istence. To spend fabulous sums 'on
marine "defense" that becomes ob
; solete in such quick order is always
a difficult stand to justify particu
larly in times as the present when
the national government may be
forced to raise taxes in the face of
J lowered incomes on the part (Jf 'the
taxpayers. That so many people
' should attack Hoover's reduction
j without any immediate war facing
| this country is surprising. The big
| cause for it all is that certain con
i gressmen will loose certain local
j naval yards and that sort of thing.
I A big navy increases our "zone of
! interest" and, as our spheres in
i crease, we need more ships, ad in
| finitum, ad naeusitum.
That Hoover is caught between
i the two forces in this and other
j cases will be used as sentimental
} blindfolds for many voters in 1932.
S The people should remember that
1 all presidents are placed in similar
; positions; and the greatest have had
the most opposition from both sides.
| Also, we must always bear in mind
| that no one forces men to accept
; the presidency; they accept it of
! their own free volition.
