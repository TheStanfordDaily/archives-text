DIKIGIBLE at the New MENLO 1
Theatre
It takes several airplane smash- i
ups, a dirigible crash, and the rescue
of two men from the ice fields of
Antarctic wastes to prove it, but
"Dirigible" is a thriller. Interwoven \
in the story is the usual Holt-Graves
struggle over the only woman (Fay |
Wray).
Free advertising for the "lighter 1
than air" branch of the aeronautics I
division of the U.S. Navy seems the j
main reason for the picture. When 1
a man has his foot cut off with a
butcher knife, it isn't news, but it
makes darn good picture stuff and
the incident is accorded full dra
matic value. Interesting views are
shown of the construction of a di- |
rigible but we've since learned that
the whole dirigible crash was filmed
on the "lot" in Hollywood. Don't let
a little truth interfere with your
pleasure though, as it proves all the
more the ability of the "fakers" in
films.

THE WORLD OF LIGHT—By Al
dous Huxley. Doubleday Doran.
193 L (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Mr. Huxley, until now the cynical
and bored intellectual, has taken a
; pollyannic turn—even to the extent
Jof admitting through one of his
i characters, a rise of faith, etcetera.
Milne and Noel Coward might
have collaborated on this comedy.
It hasn't the sparkle of Coward's
work, but avoids that too painfully
childish air often found in Milne.
The third act wanders too much
in the fields of metaphysical non
sense. Until then Huxley spends
little time doing other than amuse.
When he finally makes a half
hearted attempt to propose a thesis
his play suffers.
As Aldous' first dramatic attempt
it reveals startling change of philo
sophic outlook and amuses enough
to succeed. —J.S.S.

TWO PEOPLE—By A. A. Milne.
New York. E. I*. Button & Com
pany. 193JL. (At the Stanford
Bookstore.)
Milne's first attempt shows that
he can write novels as well as plays
and essays and stories and poems.
The trite plot is the situation of
the brilliant writer with the dumb
wife—the two people. She is in
triguingly dumb. When her husband
tells her he has written her a novel

all she says is, "Fancy!" Occasion
ally Reginald wonders just a little
about Sylvia but then he makes a
list of "things Sylvia can do better
than me." His statistics show that
she plays golf with careless effi
ciency, that animals adore her, that
she can do incredible things with a
needle, and that she is lovely.
Lena Coleby, representing intelli
gent womanhood, enters on page 83.
She represents the understanding,
"I do just know you, don't I?" type
who shortly leaves Reginald and the
reader in peace—but we should have
left this for you to find out.
"Two People" is not particularly
outstanding for originality or style.
In it, however, Milne succeeds in
being clever without being [that
tiresome of all tiresomenesses! too
clever. —E.Tif*,
