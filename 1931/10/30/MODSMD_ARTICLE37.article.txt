The Editor, Sir:
Imagine our surprise! Abe Mellin
koff, who writes the scathing stuil
that appeared in Wednesday's Daily
in support of the economy policy of
ncn-delivery, learned this morning
for the first time that the Daily
DOES NOT GET $2.00 per quarter
from each and every student who is
a member of the A.S.S.U., but that
the quarterly subscription is still
hovering around the HALF-DOL
LAR mark which was established
near the beginning of the present
century.
We can't help wondering if there
aren't more people in this University
who have no better ideas on the
costs of printing and distributing a
newspaper.
One of the first things the writers
■would like to bring out is the fact
that the Stanford Daily is printed
and circulated on a subscription fee
that is appreciably less than that of
any other paper of comparable size
and service in any college on the
Coast.
Another matter which deserves i
attention is the shrinkage in the
lineage in advertising, with subse
quent decreases in available income
for the Daily, at the same time that
printing costs are stationary." And '
the stationary level in printing costs
is, in effect, an increase, due to the |
fact that wage trends are generally '
downward.
And the most surprising thing of
all is that the Daily can even think j
of continuing circulation on the '
campus, or off, because many papers
simply stack the copies in some cen
tral location and each student calls
for his own.
