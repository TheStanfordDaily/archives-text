# The 						Windjammer

### 
This business of "hearing nothing
but the vaguest of reports about
secret football practice sessions is
beginning to wear on the good old
colyum's nerves. After all we're as
patient as most people, but making
a news story of the fact that "the
boys scrimmaged today'' is some
thing else again. Hell's fire! Would
one expect to find an organized tea
and-bridge in progress on the prac
tice field, or would one?

Our contemporary Clark Ga
bles and Norma Talmadges are
going around in circles today,
with rabbits' feet in their pock
ets and the fear of the Great
God Stage-Fright in their hearts,
all on account of ye first produc
tion draniatique of ye presente
season. The reviews have called
it everything from a fantasy to
melodramatic opera, but we
have it from inside dope that
it's a whale of a good produc
tion. How's for dropping the col
legiate anti-campus sophistica
tion, and dropping in on Mr.
llelvenston tonight?

Here's something to be classed
with Hulme's "Jokes to Be Told to
Students of History 1, 2, & 3." Ought
to save it till the end of the quarter,
but we might forget it then:
A sophomore showed up at a
final examination in December
with absolutely no idea of what
the subject was all about, so be
wrote: "God knows, I don't.
Merry Christmas."
Receiving his paper, properly
graded by the professor, after the
holidays, he found this notation:
"God gets 100; you get 0. Happy
New Year!"
Twinkle, twinkle, little girls,
With your straight hair, or
your curls;
I wonder—was it search for
KNOWLEDGE
That brought you all to this
men's college?

Someone told us the other day
that at Roman banquets the guests
all wore garlics on their heads. Ha,
ha! They can't fool us! We know that
no really worthwhile ancient Roman
had a head anyway. (Good old
windjammer! He gets the point
every time!— Editor's note.)
