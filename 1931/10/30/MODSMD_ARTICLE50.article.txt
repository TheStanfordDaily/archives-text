## 
### 
Coach Sherman Loekwood has I
pared the varsity tennis squad down I
to 20 men, with the present rank- j
ings to be permanent for the quar- |
ter, Working mostly on the basis of I
past performance, Coach Loekwood
cut 30-odd men off the squad this '
week and put them into a special j
class, P.E. 121, leaving the top 20
to fight it out among themselves J
next quarter, while those remaining j
will scramble for positions among j
themselves all this quarter!
Following is the squad as per- j
manently set for autumn quarter: ;
I. Joe Coughlin, 2. Bob Forbes, 3. |
Kelsey Petterson, 4. Chuck Otis, |
5. Hubert Butler, 6. Dan Ellis, 7. j
John Gordon, 8. George Forney, !

3. George Bergstrom, 14. Ray Ed- j
vards, 15. Bill Wentworth, 16. i
Charles Dodge, 17. Harry Haehl, 18. |
tobert Moore, 19. Joe Melczer, 20. i
Ben Fidanque.
Butler Injured
Butler, however, will be out of
play for some time due to a frac
tured him sustained in an auto acci
dent Tuesday night.
At the same time as the varsity
squad, freshman rankings were an
nounced. Twenty-three are listed,
ladder play to be continuous, with
positions constantly changing until j
the real order is ironed out. Follow- I
ing is the list: Sam Lee, Robert !
Lilienthal, Don Nelson, Bud Dreyer, ;
Pierre Zucco, Hugh Moran* Ray i
Jadarola, John Huston, Ben Holt, !
Don Dana, Bob Grantier, Tom â– 

1 Pinckney, Bob Harvey, Henry
' Cooke, Robert Barnard, Robert
; Ransom, Phillips Bronson, Albert
1 Page, Everette Moses, Glenn Mar- ;
i tineau, Henry Mudd, Philip Falk,
I James Madden.
Jadarola Advances
Already one climber has advanced '
j two rungs. Ray Jadarola, formerly
in seventh place, first took on Hugh
Moran, just above him, and won
| an easy 6-0, (5-0 victory. Then he
! lurned to Pierre Zucco and grabbed i
| his fifth position. This changes the j
j rankings to Jadarola, fifth, Zucco, '
i sixth, and Moran, seventh. This list- ;
! ing is obviously very tentative, as
| the whole outfit will undoubtedly
j look entirely different, with the ex-
I ccption of first man, at various times
j throughout the quarter.
