LOS ANGELES, Oct. 29 (Exclu
sive). —Bill Spaulding's Bruins, forty
strong, left the Glenclale station over
the Southern Pacific tonight to the
acclaim of the largest student gath
ering ever to see a U.C.L.A. team

off to the wars.
The destination
of the Bruins is
Palo Alto, home of
the blood - thirsty
Stanford Indians.
The objective of
the Bruins is to
prove the Indians
not so blood
thirsty.

The scene, locale, or what have
you of the festivities is the Stanford
Stadium.
Ileal Struggle
Has all the ear-marks of a real
struggle, hasn't it? And it will be a
real struggle for a good many rea
sons.
These in order are:
1. Your average Bruin rooter
(there are approximately 1500
of the variety) senses an upset
and will he on hand to view the
game to the tune of a large
Bruin rooting section.
2. The U.C.L.A. squad has a
favorable spot in that the Stan
ford squad is expected to hold
back because of the U.S.C. game
a week from Saturday.
:{. Spaulding has his strongest
team in history and for this par
ticular game has it at its very
peak of condition.
4. Various and sundry reasons
why people play football any
way.
Tentative Line-up
Spauldiny's starting line-up is not
definite. The backfield combination
of Captain Norm Duncan, fullback;
Joe Keeble and Robert Decker, half
backs; and Lenny Bergdahl is al
most a certainty.
But in the line the situation is
much different. Len Wellendorf
starts at one end. At the other flank,
however, there is doubt, since
Spaulding may choose either Dick
lVlulhaupt, the logical choice but in
jured, Walt Stickel, or Bob Maxwell.
At the tackles Lloyd McMillan and
Mike Dim as are the outstanding
choices. There is a possibility, how
ever, that Dimas may be supplanted
by either Don Jacobson, "Fat" Nor
fleet, or Kearns Hampton.
Bull Jones and Ed Austin should
start at guards but "Spec" Haslam
will probably contest the latter's po
sition.
Homer Oliver will start at center
with Lee Coates in reserve.
Big Rooting Section
This rooting section the Bruins are
planning on should be quite a thing.
The band leaves tomorrow night
with a large contingent of rooters on
the S.S. Alexandria. The musical
organization, reputed to be one of
(he outstanding of Bruin bands, is
under the direction of Lewis Lowe.
Its presence will lend much glamour
to the Bruin rooting section.

off to the wars.
The destination
of the Bruins is
Palo Alto, home of
the blood - thirsty
Stanford Indians.
The objective of
the Bruins is to
prove the Indians
not so blood
thirsty.

The scene, locale, or what have
you of the festivities is the Stanford
Stadium.
Ileal Struggle
Has all the ear-marks of a real
struggle, hasn't it? And it will be a
real struggle for a good many rea
sons.
These in order are:
1. Your average Bruin rooter
(there are approximately 1500
of the variety) senses an upset
and will he on hand to view the
game to the tune of a large
Bruin rooting section.
2. The U.C.L.A. squad has a
favorable spot in that the Stan
ford squad is expected to hold
back because of the U.S.C. game
a week from Saturday.
:{. Spaulding has his strongest
team in history and for this par
ticular game has it at its very
peak of condition.
4. Various and sundry reasons
why people play football any
way.
Tentative Line-up
Spauldiny's starting line-up is not
definite. The backfield combination
of Captain Norm Duncan, fullback;
Joe Keeble and Robert Decker, half
backs; and Lenny Bergdahl is al
most a certainty.
But in the line the situation is
much different. Len Wellendorf
starts at one end. At the other flank,
however, there is doubt, since
Spaulding may choose either Dick
lVlulhaupt, the logical choice but in
jured, Walt Stickel, or Bob Maxwell.
At the tackles Lloyd McMillan and
Mike Dim as are the outstanding
choices. There is a possibility, how
ever, that Dimas may be supplanted
by either Don Jacobson, "Fat" Nor
fleet, or Kearns Hampton.
Bull Jones and Ed Austin should
start at guards but "Spec" Haslam
will probably contest the latter's po
sition.
Homer Oliver will start at center
with Lee Coates in reserve.
Big Rooting Section
This rooting section the Bruins are
planning on should be quite a thing.
The band leaves tomorrow night
with a large contingent of rooters on
the S.S. Alexandria. The musical
organization, reputed to be one of
(he outstanding of Bruin bands, is
under the direction of Lewis Lowe.
Its presence will lend much glamour
to the Bruin rooting section.
